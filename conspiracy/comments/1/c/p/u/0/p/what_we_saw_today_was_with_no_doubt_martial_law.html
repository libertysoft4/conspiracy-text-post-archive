    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m seeing here is sensationalist hype in order to slander something that didn&#39;t exactly happen and fearmonger for personal political views.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People were allowed to leave their homes at any time of the day, yet chose not to. </p></li>
<li><p>It was not the entire city, it was only a section of the city that they&#39;ve pinned the suspect hiding in. </p></li>
<li><p>The police did not come barging into homes without permission. They&#39;ve asked and were allowed in by the homeowners to do a quick search for the suspect. Why did they search people&#39;s homes? In case the bomber decided to take a family hostage or was hiding, which he was doing when they caught him hiding under a tarp in someone&#39;s backyard. No, the homeowner was not arrested for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Once they&#39;ve captured the suspect, all of the forces quickly packed up and headed off, leaving the homeowners further free to do what they so wish. </p></li>
<li><p>As for being over-the-top armed SWAT teams and police in bulletproof vests scouring the area? ...Why not? Do you want a repeat of the 1995 North Hollywood bank robbery where the LAPD couldn&#39;t even handle taking down two heavily armed men because of being under-equipped? ..Especially so given the fact that during the first shootout with the brothers in Boston by <strong>NORMAL</strong> police officers, they were using grenades along with firearms against the officers that resulted in multiple wounded men. I&#39;ll clarify that for you: They were using <strong>MILITARY-GRADE WEAPONS</strong> against officers and you&#39;re claiming the Police were over-reacting with their gear and equipment? Redditor, please!</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final statement:</strong> Everything I&#39;ve said here is backed up by other comments in this thread. So no, I do not agree with OP here but stated why and I&#39;m allowed to share my opposing viewpoint as given by the moderators of this subreddit.</p>

<p>Who is saying this? </p>

<p>What information do they have to suggest this? </p>

<p>Where did this information come from? Is it a credible source? </p>

<p>Does anyone else corroborate this information? Are they a credible source? </p>

<p>What further details can you provide?</p>

<p>Where will this &quot;stuff&quot; take place?</p>

<p>Who will be doing this stuff?</p>

<p>Why do they want to do this stuff?</p>

You are correct, him saying &quot;everyone&quot; is poor word choice, obviously not everyone is saying it. But for the people that follow the theory that all these tragic events are a way to strip us of our rights, they claim there is a coming event that will set all this &quot;police state/stripping of rights&quot; stuff in to full gear. Again, sorry I don&#39;t have the links of people saying this but I&#39;m sure you can agree that there would at least be SOME people thinking this will happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the date of the US assault weapons ban. </p>

<p>The US has slowly been passing gun regulation legislation at the federal and statewide levels for years. Even now they want to ban how many bullets you can have in your magazine. How many bullets can be fired per/trigger pull, and what accessories you can have. </p>

<p>They are taxing bullets, and making it harder for people to purchase firearms. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t anything new, I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t heard of this. </p>

<p>Oh, you mean the one that expired on September 13, 2004? Yeah, That was neat.</p>

<p>I purchased a S&amp;W 915 shortly before the ban was passed. For a brief period of time I couldn&#39;t buy a 30 round magazine for my pistol. It was a nightmare. </p>

<p>The federal government prohibited the manufacture certain semi-automatic firearms for civilian use. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban&#39;s enactment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first of all, those were not tanks, 2nd of all you should read the constitution, there is something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exigent_circumstance_in_United_States_law">Exigent circumstance</a>. I know its inconvenient to read the constitution and all of its amendments, but it is essential that we do not lose sight of what its meaning and purpose is, no matter how inconvenient it is for you.</p>

<p>and as for guns being taken away, I refer to the earlier guys comments. They will never go door to door to take away guns from people because guns became illegal, and if/when that bill passes I will be on your side, but until that law is even being discussed (which it is not) then stop giving into fear mongers such as Alex Jones. He and others like him, are profiting from fear, and it is unhealthy to the American conscience. </p>

<p>Lastly, having opposing views and having conversations discussed does not make it a useless conversation, maybe a frustrating one for you, but it is not useless, when you start shutting out other peoples ideals and only listening to your own then you are no better than the &quot;men you fear&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, they banned a type of weapon for a time.  That ban has been lifted.  Also, during the ban, if you owned an assault weapon you kept that weapon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>perhaps you can show me any instance in all this where civilians were forced to do anything. they had every right to decline a search of their house, but my guess is a perfectly reasonable use of <a href="http://lawbrain.com/wiki/Hot_Pursuit">hot pursuit</a> would have been used. but luckily it appears most bostonians weren&#39;t wearing their tin foil hats, so it wasn&#39;t necessary. they weren&#39;t forced to stay in their homes, it was just suggested, and my guess is most of them wanted to stay in their homes seeing as these guys were tossing bombs out their car window and killing cops. but watching all the footage, there were plenty of people who ignored the warning and were out and about, and even driving. but maybe you can show where military took over the role of government. oh wait...you can&#39;t, because it didn&#39;t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the term irks you in particular, but the rest of his comment provides his argument and I don&#39;t think he was being dismissive. </p>

<p>People by and large were not resisting any of this because they identified the situation as a legitimate danger. If there were accounts of people refusing police entrance to their homes, that would have suggested varying opinions on the situation. But since there haven&#39;t been any reports of this, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an awful thing to say that bostonians thought it crazy to be uncooperative with police when their established priority was declared to be public safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, if &quot;tinfoil hat&quot; is some kind of banned term in this subreddit, i&#39;ll take it back. but obviously my point is that bostonians didn&#39;t assume that this was some complex government conspiracy to enact martial law. they assumed law enforcement was trying to find an armed and dangerous person, who already bombed the shit out of a large group of people in their city, and killed a police officer, and opened fire on other boston police officers, so they let them look. but that&#39;s a mouthful, so i went with &quot;they weren&#39;t wearing tinfoil hats.&quot;</p>

<p>That quote during the news conference could only make me laugh. Whether people were forced or chose to stay inside/on lock down, Boston fucking stopped for terrorism. $200 million in lost revenue, people afraid to go outside. It is the complete opposite of what the American people are supposedly about, &quot;not stopping for terrorism&quot;</p>

Sure they evacuated people out of their homes but they were looking for the suspect and they didn&#39;t shoot any civilians in the process. They found the man relatively quickly.

Would you give him shelter and hide him from the police? Would you give him more time to plant more bombs and maybe kill more people that you love? Would you give him a meal, and pat his back and say good job? Would you tell the police to stand down and not gear and let him roam the streets because you know he&#39;s a good guy?  It&#39;s always easier to say what we would do if it was us in this situation, but the truth is we wouldn&#39;t know what to do, and it wasn&#39;t us in the situation. Everyone says they would have done this, and that but if shit was to happen, and they were presented with it right in front of their face, they&#39;d run. I&#39;d highly doubt anyone in here would take a bullet for me, nor would they have confronted this guy, in realty they would run and then complain that things weren&#39;t done right.</p>

<p>How, then, could you even pretend to find an impartial jury, since any person you picked to be on that jury would likely have already seen the evidence--or at least some of it, and without context or explanation, never mind a chance for the defense to make their case--and already made up their mind?</p>
