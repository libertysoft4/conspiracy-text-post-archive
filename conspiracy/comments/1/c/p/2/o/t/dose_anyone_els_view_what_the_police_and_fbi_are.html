    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not technically martial law. Martial law is when the military is placed in charge of security during an emergency situation. </p>

<p>In the United States, the police have simply been militarized. They look like soldiers don&#39;t they? But they&#39;re not army. They&#39;re not even national guard (which are allowed to be deployed under the authority of a governor, unarmed, for disaster relief). Nope, those are police officers. ... and that&#39;s the fucked up part.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The old slippery slope, huh? Permenant curfews in major cities? Really? A part of me thinks that those who actually believe this stuff will happen, actually want it to happen. Be honest, you want the government to impose egregious stuff like that so that you can rail against the system even more. Well we have a thing in the country called the Constitution. It doesn&#39;t allow things like we saw in Boston to happen unless there is a very good reason for them. A permanent curfew in urban centers could not and would not ever happen in this country. It&#39;s unconstitutional. If it by chance ever did there would be an uprising from the citizenry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the police enter a house under exigent circumstances any evidence they gather must be related to the reason they entered the house. Since they weren&#39;t going into the houses looking for drugs, they wouldn&#39;t be able to lawfully confiscate the drugs or arrest you. If the police did try this it would probably be a violation of the 4th Amendment. Either way, the police were not concerned with small amounts of drugs. There&#39;s a very good chance they encountered things like weed and bowls or whatever and just didn&#39;t give a shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Boston and I&#39;ve been saying it all along, I had no problem whatsoever with what the police did. I haven&#39;t talked to a single person in the city who has. It&#39;s very easy for people to watch the news 1000 miles away and declare that our rights are gone and this is the new norm. It&#39;s not the new norm, this was an extraordinary and unprecedented situation with an unprecedented, yet in my opinion justified, response. </p>
