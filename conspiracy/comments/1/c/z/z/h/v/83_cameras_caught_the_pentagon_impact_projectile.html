    <div class="md"><p>Because the American public are brainwashed dolts. They have been made to feel afraid and ashamed to question the official story. They don&#39;t want to face the scowels and being called a freak for daring to question the sacred narrative.</p>

<p>The 9/11 &quot;official story&quot; can be plainly deduced as a lie, fraud, cover up by just a little research. The contradictions will make your head spin. </p>

<p>The official story doesn&#39;t make sense. But, a shocked (true psychological shock) American public, with their blank minds susceptible to suggestion as they replayed the planes hitting the towers over and over on TV, believed the bullshit as if it was a mass hypnotherapy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the oldest brainwash technics there is.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the mistake you made:</p>

<p>The initial FOIA requested videotapes that <strong>might have</strong> shown what hit the pentagon.</p>

<p>The initial search turned up 85 tapes. Basically someone went into a computer and came up with 85 results.</p>

<p>Not that 85 tapes exist that show the plane hitting the Pentagon, just that they had 85 tapes collected of videotape evidence from the entire 9/11 event by the Washington FBI office.</p>

<p>Of these 85 tapes: </p>

<p>56 &quot;of these videotapes did not show either the Pentagon building, the Pentagon crash site, or the impact of Flight 77 into the Pentagon on September 11.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the remaining 29 videotapes, 16 &quot;did not show the Pentagon crash site and did not show the impact of Flight 77 into the Pentagon.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the 13 remaining tapes, 12 &quot;only showed the Pentagon after the impact of Flight 77.&quot;</p>

<p>Only one tape showed the Pentagon impact: the Pentagon&#39;s own security camera footage, that would later be released. </p>

<p>Included in here are the two major releases of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LJvFjsl6zk">Citgo gas station</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bapUohJn1E8">DoubleTree hotel</a> cameras that do not show Flight 77 impacting the Pentagon. These are the only two cameras that truthers have said that the FBI &quot;mysteriously confiscated&quot; the footage from.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/en65Q">If you want to know what is exactly on those 85 tapes, here is a list.</a></p>

He got a Job at AA as a Pilot.  Guess whos plane hit the Pentagon that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so you&#39;re saying that it wasn&#39;t a &#39;hijacker&#39;, then.  That&#39;s the &#39;plane&#39; whose flight recorder has no instances of the cockpit door being opened at all, IIRC.</p>

<p>Now, why in the world would the pilot, knowing that he and everyone else on the plane were going to die, deliberately aim for that exact spot and kill many more?  Was this pilot conspiring with the hijackers?  He had some options, didn&#39;t he?</p>

<p>A lot of questions are raised by your assertion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I doubt there were even Hijackers.  Theres no proof if any hijackers were on the plane at all. They had a list of the &quot;Terrorists&quot; that had boarded each plane.  As of Post 9/11 I think 9 of 15 were still alive and well. Some had never been to America.</p>

<p>The only thing that needed to happen, was he had to be the Pilot.  Thats the only thing they needed to make sure this plane hit the Pentagon, was to make sure he was the Pilot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The better question is why in October of 2000, was the Pentagon conducting training exercises, which simulate a Boeing 757 crashing into the Pentagon.</p>

<p>An Ex Navy F4 Pilot, participated in an earlier version if this drill. He then retires, after working with the pentagon for 17 years and becomes a Pilot at AA. Guess whos plane crashes into the Pentagon during 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet, They did.
-1999 - NATO start to conduct drills which simulate the Pentagon and both the WTC are hit by a Boeing 757.
- October 2000 - Pentagon Conduct drills in which simulate <em>Hijacked</em> Boeing 757 crasheing into the Pentagon.</p>

<p>The icing on the cake, is the Pilot of the Plane that we are told hit the Pentagon. He is an Ex-Navy F4 Pilot, who also worked with the Pentagon for 17 years, who also took part in these drills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your evidence for these assertions?  In particular, that &quot;NATO start to conduct drills which simulate the Pentagon and both the WTC are hit by a Boeing 757. - October 2000 - Pentagon Conduct drills in which simulate Hijacked Boeing 757 crasheing into the Pentagon&quot;? </p>

<p>EDIT: here is a very thorough debunking of the exact claims you are parroting: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/burlingame_and_mascal.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/burlingame_and_mascal.html</a></p>

<p>In sum, first there is no support for the notion that Burlingame had anything to do with the plane crash training at the Pentagon.  In fact, he had been out of the Air Force for 20 years at that point and had only worked in the Pentagon part time as a member of the national guard until 1997, while working full time as an AA pilot (the latter point is based on the Philly Inquirer article cited in the wikipedia link you included above, so I&#39;m not sure how you missed it contradicting your assertions...).  Second, the plane crash training was exactly how I described it--training for a civilian aviation accident, not training for the type of attack that occurred on 9-11.  There are plenty of links that flesh all this out with actual sources in the above.  If you have reason to believe they are wrong or have other sources not considered in the above, please do share them.</p>

If you cannot actually challenge the evidence, it would be much more dignified to just admit as much and bow out of the conversation; continuing on only show cases your willingness to believe in something you cannot defend.

    <div class="md"><p>Heres the exactly Quote from the Expert. <em>&quot;The Pentagon conducted a training exercise called &quot;MASCAL&quot; simulating the crash of a Boeing 757 into the building on 24 October 2000, and yet Condoleezza Rice, among others, has repeatedly asserted that &quot;no one ever imagined&quot; a domestic airplane could be used as a weapon.&#39;</em> <a href="http://www.scholarsfor911truth.org/PressRelease30Jan2006.html">http://www.scholarsfor911truth.org/PressRelease30Jan2006.html</a></p>

<p>So, before 9/11 they were already doing drills as if a Hijacked 757 hits the Pentagon..  Now, If no one thinks a plane like that can be used as a weapon, why was the Pentagon doing drill scenarios for something that people thought couldn&#39;t happen?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying there is no way, that an F4 Pilot, who then goes to work for AA, who also worked for the Pentagon, who also drafted an incident almost identical to what happened on 9/11, didn&#39;t have anything to do with what happened.</p>

<p>Okay</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That quote does not say anything about a hijacked airlplane hitting the building, though.  Do you really not see that?  Why do you keep adding the hijacked language when you characterize it?  </p>

<p>The actual quote is entirely consistent with what I&#39;ve shown you: the pentagon is right in the incoming and outbound flight paths for Reagan Int&#39;l Airport.  They would of course train for a civilian accident contingency.</p>

<p>Re the guy who quit working at the pentagon several years before you allege the training took place, yes, I would assert it likely he had nothing to do with the training.  Do you have any evidence to the contrary?</p>

<p>EDIT: here is a link to an article describing the 2000 MASCAL exercise at the Pentagon: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041026105828/http://www.dcmilitary.com/army/pentagram/5_44/local_news/2852-1.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20041026105828/http://www.dcmilitary.com/army/pentagram/5_44/local_news/2852-1.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;The fire and smoke from the downed passenger aircraft billows from the Pentagon courtyard. Defense Protective Services Police seal the crash sight. Army medics, nurses and doctors scramble to organize aid. An Arlington Fire Department chief dispatches his equipment to the affected areas.</p>

<p>Don Abbott, of Command Emergency Response Training, walks over to the Pentagon and extinguishes the flames. The Pentagon was a model and the &#39;plane crash&#39; was a simulated one.</p>

<p>The Pentagon Mass Casualty Exercise, as the crash was called, was just one of several scenarios that emergency response teams were exposed to Oct. 24-26 in the Office of the Secretaries of Defense conference room. ...</p>

<p>A major player in the exercise was the Arlington Fire Department.</p>

<p>&#39;Our role is fire and rescue,&#39; Battalion Chief R.W. Cornwell said. &#39;We get to see how each other operates and the roles and responsibilities of each. You have to plan for this. Look at all the air traffic around here.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>None of the talk about the plane scenario mentions it being part of a terrorist attack on the pentagon.  In fact, they describe the plane in the scenario as having crashed in the courtyard (not hitting the building directly) and the fire chief explicitly notes that his worry about a plane crash is driven by the amount of air traffic in the area.  Again, those are entirely consistent with the drill being about a civil aviation accident due to the location of the pentagon and inconsistent with your as-of-yet unsupported claim that they were part of a terrorist attack scenario.  But that&#39;s not even the end of it.  The article does, in fact, reference another scenario that they trained for that was a terrorist attack scenario at a nearby construction site, and that scenario does not seem to have involved planes.  The specific discussion of construction site training being about a terrorist attack and the omission of such a key fact from the airliner crash training should give rise to a strong inference that the airplane scenario was not a terrorist scenario. Taking that inference with the quoted comments above, I think it is hard to conclude otherwise absent evidence to the contrary, which you have yet to present.</p>

<p>My own personal take on it is the same thought I had as I watched the two towers crumble. &quot;That was more than just an airplane or two to cause this&quot;. I knew immediately there were explosives involved. It was way too controlled. It virtually fell on its own footprint. That only happens with controlled demolition.

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li>I did a research paper a few years back on the 9/11 conspiracy, working from memory here - </li>
</ul>

<p>The section of the Pentagon that was hit, was actually renovated before the plane hit.  Actually, they finished renovations, on 9/11.  The missile, that hit the pentagon went through all 3 layers of Reinforced Concrete, and out the back of the 3rd layers. The layers being C, D and E. E being the outside wall.</p>

<p>If a Plane hit the Pentagon, there would be a lot more destruction than what was shown.  The measurements of a Boeing 757-200 is as follows.</p>

<pre><code> - Wing Section - 124 ft 10 in (38.05 m) 
 - Entire Length - 155 ft 3 in (47.32 m) 
 - Tail Section- 44 ft 6 in (13.6 m) 
</code></pre>

<p>I think the hole in the pentagon was something like 12 or 13 feet in Diameter.  Thats it, 13 feet, from a a Boeing 757-200, with a wing section of over 100 feet, leaves a 13 foot hole, goes through 3 layers of reinforced concrete, and stops after punching through the 3rd layer.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t find any bodies, because &quot;The immense heat from the Jet Fuel Vaporized everyone,&quot; yet, they were able to ID almost everyone.  The best part about it, all of the computers damaged, the ones that were in the pentagon, weren&#39;t able to be recovered.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a lot of insider information that just completely vanished without any chance of retrieving it.</p>

However, if you observe pictures of other plane crashes, and compare them to the Pentagon and the flight that went down in the field, it is blatantly obvious that the crash sites look vastly different.</p>

<p>And I am no physicist, but I do know it takes a great amount of energy to completely vaporize a human, and something tells me these crashes did not produce that needed energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said in my reply above, there needs to be more context to those images. When Flight 93 crashed it was going almost 600 mph, do you know if there&#39;s examples to compare it to of planes going that fast when they crashed? </p>

<p>Most crashes (and I&#39;m willing to bet quite a few of those) occur at much lower speeds, either on takeoff or landing or from pilots efforts to slow the plane down. The author seems to be using similar plane size as the variable to compare to, but a 757 that crashes at 200 mph and a 757 that crashes at 600 mph would look very different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres a problem with that though. 80% of plane crashes occur on either takeoff or landing, when the planes are going much slower. The kinetic energy going into crash is exponentially higher for a plane going 600 mph than a plane going 300 mph or less, so it&#39;s safe to assume the damage would be much greater. Just looking at the google images alone gives no context for the crash, and it&#39;s safe to assume this was the case for many of them. In order to accurately compare you&#39;d need pictures of planes that were going full speed when they crashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s... not really how missiles work. Making them bigger (after a certain point!) doesn&#39;t necessarily give them more range or make them more versatile. You end up with diminishing returns since you now need to carry more fuel for your heavier missile, have larger control surfaces to produce enough lift, can&#39;t store as many as you could if they were smaller, spend more time maintaining them (since there&#39;s now more things on the missile that can break), and limit what platforms can use the now-tremendous missile. Why would they need a &quot;drone missile&quot; (???) when you could use a typical cruise missile to do the same thing? </p>

<p>In fact, if you&#39;re going to fake an attack on the Pentagon, why not just wire up a real plane and fly it in via remote control? The person actually flying the plane could be in a chase plane (you could probably justify it by saying that they were attempting to intercept the aircraft). Now you don&#39;t have to worry about amateur video footage showing that you actually flew a tremendously impractical weapon into the Pentagon.</p>

<p>How would you get that many people to go along with it, too? You&#39;d need the cooperation of the airline (someone would notice if one of their flights crashed but they still somehow had all their planes!), people to pretend to be families of the people on the plane, people to know those people (so that they didn&#39;t just seem like plants), etc etc?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(the downvote isn&#39;t me, for what it&#39;s worth)</p>

<p>Yeah, but... why? What benefit does endurance give you when you could just launch the cruise missile from something that can sit on station for months, like a warship? Cruise missiles can already fly extremely low to avoid detection. Making it big like that would render it less agile and far more easily detected -- its radar cross section would be much larger than that of a typical missile. If the &quot;drone missile&quot; crashes, you have no guarantee that the explosives will even work.</p>

<p>Drone missiles would be a super practical and awesome thing if we hadn&#39;t yet invented aircraft. Why not just use your favorite multi-role fighter? Put up a tanker and it can stay on station for hours. It has a narrow fuselage that contains electronics, steering systems, communications, and fuel tanks. They do not travel as fast as cruise missiles and can fly low to avoid radar. When they&#39;re high in the air, they&#39;re relatively quiet! When you want to blow something up, fire a missile or drop a bomb. Or, hell, just use a regular drone. &quot;Drone missiles&quot; are a terrifically impractical idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at it as it crosses over the freeway though, it is about as long as the freeway is wide. The drone itself is only around 30 feet long or so. The missile is in no way longer than that. The object in the gif looks very easily a lot longer than 30 ft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes I do agree there can be weapons us the public do not know about, but this would also be the missile itself we are seeing, not the drone. I just find it hard to beleive a secret one is much bigger than the ones we know about. From the 8 or so I looked up that are in service/have been in service the largest was 38 feet in length. I know we can not fully come to a decision based off this gif, but my personal opinion does not think the missile would be that large. </p>
