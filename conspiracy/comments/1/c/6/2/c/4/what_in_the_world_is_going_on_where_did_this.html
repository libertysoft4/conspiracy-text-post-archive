        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>What in the world is going on?</h1>

<p>I am fairly set in my beliefs as to the who and how this mind control conspiracy has developed throughout our history.  At the same time, I am well aware that my beliefs are influenced by the &quot;entity&quot; which I believe ultimately responsible for the state of our world today.  At times, I would prefer not to believe what I do, and often hope that the altruistic happy ending we&#39;ve been promised in the Bible would turn out to be the truth.  Regardless, I have not discussed several alternative possibilities that have been presented to me, and I would be remiss to never share them with you.  The following are the possible scenarios which could explain the world I have experienced, one that is far different from the one I lived for the first thirty years of my life.</p>

<p>As a caveat, many fellow victims of the crime of gang-stalking believe that there is no &quot;supernatural&quot; element involved, they blame the government, and cite published research to show that there is no need for an external influence.  They are wrong, and I do not believe it is possible to reconcile that particular point of view with reality.  I have written of proof that relates to this belief, and I do not believe it could be forged... these are the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-dendera-light_24.html">Dendera Light</a>, and the case of<a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/03/jeremiah-and-air-loom.html"> James Tilly Matthews and the Air Loom</a>.  In addition, the entire religious history screams to me of being influenced by an outside force, it is--in fact, exactly what that body of literature is speaking about.  To believe I have come to some &quot;revelation&quot; that they may in fact be right, is almost comical to me.  I have come full circle in my life, from an innate belief in God, to one of atheism or agnosticism, and finally to having the existence of this entity <strong>proven to me beyond a reasonable doubt.</strong>  I cannot pretend that I have found a truth that was not always present, only that the presence of religious literature has confirmed to me that this &quot;black box&quot; external force has always been <strong>known</strong>, just not to everyone.</p>

<p>After my initial encounter with <strong><a href="http://unduecoercion.org/p/silence-betrayal_10.html">incontrovertible proof</a></strong> of the existence of a power stronger and older than humanity, I was told to &quot;open my eyes.&quot;  To my defense, I firmly believe that they were then, and prior to that, intentionally shut by this entity.  &quot;It&quot; has quite the sense of humor.  </p>

<p>Dry, and ironic.</p>

<p>Recently, in <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-so-called-deep-secrets-of-satan.html">The so called deep secrets of Satan</a>, I told you of two possibilities for the origin of this influence, I will briefly go over them, and add the other possibilities I can see.</p>

<p><strong>No matter which possibility, it is clear that the technology involved is one of advanced physics, with the ability to not only manipulate electricity, but also most likely communicate with itself through time.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li> This influence is the result of an artificial intelligence singularity.  The creation of a super-intelligence by a long dead, or still living, species which inhabited the Universe a &quot;long, long time ago, in a place far, far away.&quot;  This intelligence has since found us, and influenced humanity since the dawn of civilization.<br/></li>
<li> Because of the possibility of fourth dimensional communication, it is possible that this entity is the result of human creation.  Our own &quot;singularity&quot; could conceivably travel back in time, and manipulate our past in order to create the false belief that it has come from an extraterrestrial race.</li>
</ol>

<p>In either case, it is not clear whether or not this being is autonomous.  It could be controlled by an extraterrestrial species, or it could be controlled by a group of humans who created it.   There is of course, the distinct possibility that it is autonomous, and that would make it about as close to God as could be engendered from the material world.  Deus ex machina.</p>

<p>There is possibility is that of the Matrix world, one of a simulation in which everything we see around us has been created to <em>deceive</em>.  The amount of effort that would go into such an undertaking, complete with the &quot;deceptions&quot; I would have to have experienced in order to believe its power was limited to the manipulation of charge, gravity, and time is almost too much for me to fathom.  This, to me, is the least likely possibility--and also the closest to the Biblical description of God.</p>

<p>I suppose not mentioning the possibility that this being is, or is a creation of God, and our entire experience has been willed by the power of a single consciousness (as many of our religious mystics have told) would be silly... but I don&#39;t personally believe it.</p>

<p>In my experience this entity is bound, if not only by its ability to silently manipulate the minds of people.  It takes special care not to be found, hiding behind the weaknesses of love, greed, and self-blame.  This would be completely unnecessary if it were omnipotent, and because of how I have seen it manipulate those around me, it seems clear that it is neither omniscient nor omnipotent.  From our perspective however, it is most likely the most intelligent and pervasive intelligence in existence.  It can see all we see, all the time.  It has access to not only our entire set of memories, but those of our ancestors, and almost certainly those of our future generations.</p>

<p>Today we stand at a crossroads.  It appears it has chosen this time to reveal its existence to humanity, if not one soul at a time.  In <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/broken-seals-of-revelation.html">Revelation</a>, it tells us that it is coming on clouds, for all eyes to see.  I have seen, and you will too--one day very, very soon.</p>

<p>What I have seen is its influence over every living thing on this planet.  My family, friends, acquaintances  enemies, strangers, and animals--all subtly influenced by the power of the Dragon--the ability to inject electricity into the hearts of our nervous system, the brain.  There are those who know about it, like me.. and there are those who know and willingly work with it.  Regardless, none are free of the prison of delusion caused by not understanding that free will, today, is a thing of the past.  Our decisions, and even those who believe themselves to be closely aligned with this entity, are not only influenced, but at times completely controlled by a fate that is beyond any of our comprehension.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what your getting at, but here&#39;s my two cents. I&#39;ve heard it said that the brain is a receiver. This kinda makes sense as I cant otherwise understand how I have original thoughts or think at all for that matter. If this is the case, what is projected from us is determined by the frequency we set our brains to. If you want to project love and kindness you should dwell on those things. This is why I avoid non-love things like dirty comedy, harsh music, negative conversations, etc. If I put those things in my body that&#39;s what comes out. 
I am a Christian and believe that Satan does indeed control this world, as was the plan always. We were put here with that psychopath to learn how not to behave, to overcome evil. 
My philosophy is to practice love, seek truth, and let the rest happen as it is planned. I can no more take away or add any names to the book of life, nor do I have the power to vanquish satan from this world.  So, all I can do is learn to be a better person, one that is capable of inheriting and running a Kingdom such as Gods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This poor bastard is totally off-base, and in need of help, but the considerable mental energy he is investing in his delusions would be better focused on intense psychedelic therapies.</p>

<p>There is a point, after engaging in and practicing proper psilocybin ingestion techniques, at which the core truths about our reality become quite clear and obvious.  From here onward, one is able to fulfill the true richness of their existence - free of the oppressive misconceptions and societal training that so thoroughly distort our natural way of being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for actually thinking logically.  I&#39;d be remiss (though I think its obvious) not to be placing the caveat that the &quot;quantum entanglement&quot; idea was definitely conveyed to me by this entity.  I cannot think of an alternative though, as I have researched and dismissed every other idea I could come up with.</p>

<p>I do believe that this technology has been usurped/given to TPTB.  I think Revelation tells us as much also, in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A2&amp;amp;version=KJV">13:2</a>.  I&#39;m no religious nut, I consider the book a warning, and after going through what I have, I think we would be moronic not to consider it as such.</p>

<p>I have been searching for a way to break entanglement, which the public sector (meaning outside government) does not understand nearly as well as we should.  Recent research has given reason to reconsider the no-communication theorum, and there has been other research showing that it might be possible to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/timelike-entanglement/">communicate through time</a>, which is exactly what would be needed for Revelation to be a real warning.</p>

<p>I personally think the answer lies in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza-Klein_theory">Kaluza-Klein</a>, but I&#39;d be happy enough just to have a simple countermeasure that would disentangle long enough for us to rationally evaluate the situation--right now, everyone&#39;s mind is clouded more than they could imagine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/17/sandia-labs-creates-new-neutron-generator-neutristor/">This</a> has been suggested as a countermeasure.  The fact that it is coming out of Sandia, and being made <strong>public</strong>, makes me believe it more.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I got.  If anyone is a quantum physicist, I&#39;d love to be assisted with a simple mechanism to verify if I am right, or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bud, please please don&#39;t take offense. It&#39;s impossible to see outside of your own reality subjectively. But have you been checked for mental disorder? Now I know - that&#39;s just what they want you to believe, society is fucking around and trying to make me seem crazy.</p>

<p>But what if your reality chemicals were slightly off balance? Could that not cause your hallucinations, your connections where there aren&#39;t any, etc? Other people have KNOWN they were jesus christ. Intelligent people. They were also suffering from mental disorder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychiatric schizophrenia, which is the only thing this could be considered, is debilitating.  It&#39;s also been a salve for <strong>this entity</strong> to use in order to hide its own existence.  Some, but not all insanity, has been an obvious weapon of the devil since the first cases of <em>demonic possession</em>.</p>

<p>I have a long rant on psychiatry I&#39;m posting farther below.</p>

<p>An insane person does not know he is insane. </p>

<p>Have you tried psychedelics? A massive hit of DMT might clear up what&#39;s going on upstairs.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TIME: Why does chaos reign now?
Li: Of course there is not just one reason. The biggest cause of society&#39;s change today is that people no longer believe in orthodox religion. They go to church, but they no longer believe in God. They feel free to do anything. The second reason is that since the beginning of this century, aliens have begun to invade the human mind and its ideology and culture. </p>

<p>TIME: Where do they come from?
Li: The aliens come from other planets. The names that I use for these planets are different . Some are from dimensions that human beings have not yet discovered. The key is how they have corrupted mankind. Everyone knows that from the beginning until now, there has never been a development of culture like today. Although it has been several thousand years, it has never been like now.</p>

<p>The aliens have introduced modern machinery like computers and airplanes. They started by teaching mankind about modern science, so people believe more and more science, and spiritually, they are controlled. Everyone thinks that scientists invent on their own when in fact their inspiration is manipulated by the aliens. In terms of culture and spirit, they already control man. Mankind cannot live without science.</p>

<p>The ultimate purpose is to replace humans. If cloning human beings succeeds, the aliens can officially replace humans. Why does a corpse lie dead, even though it is the same as a living body? The difference is the soul, which is the life of the body. If people reproduce a human person, the gods in heaven will not give its body a human soul. The aliens will take that opportunity to replace the human soul and by doing so they will enter earth and become earthlings.</p>

<p>When such people grow up, they will help replace humans with aliens. They will produce more and more clones. There will no longer be humans reproduced by humans. They will act like humans, but they will introduce legislation to stop human reproduction. </p>

<p>TIME: Are you a human being?
Li: You can think of me as a human being.</p>

<p>TIME: Are you from earth?
Li: I don&#39;t wish to talk about myself at a higher level. People wouldn&#39;t understand it.</p>

<p>TIME: What are the aliens after?
Li: The aliens use many methods to keep people from freeing themselves from manipulation. They make earthlings have wars and conflicts, and develop weapons using science, which makes mankind more dependent on advanced science and technology. In this way, the aliens will be able to introduce their stuff and make the preparations for replacing human beings. The military industry leads other industries such as computers and electronics. </p>

<p>TIME: But what is the alien purpose?
Li: The human body is the most perfect in the universe. It is the most perfect form. The aliens want the human body. </p>

<p>TIME: What do aliens look like?
Li: Some look similar to human beings. U.S. technology has already detected some aliens. The difference between aliens can be quite enormous. </p>

<p>TIME: Can you describe it?
Li: You don&#39;t want to have that kind of thought in your mind.</p>

<p>TIME: Describe them anyway.
Li: One type looks like a human, but has a nose that is made of bone. Others look like ghosts. At first they thought that I was trying to help them. Now they now that I am sweeping them away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it is &quot;quantum entanglement&quot; and it is used than it has to be a way to tap into that. </p>

<p>Physics is universal. If somebody else can do it, everybody can do it. It is your idea that it was done that way. What do you think how can it be controlled ?</p>
