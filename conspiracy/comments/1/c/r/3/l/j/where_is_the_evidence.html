<p>Then they are photoshopping him by the kid who died???</p>

<p>You are in contact with this guy since 2011 and he managed to get SEMTEX???</p>

<p>its ridiculously hard to get semtex, even harder when the fbi is watching you. I cant buy into this story. The only facts we have about this situation that are supported with witnesses and others are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>FBI was running drills(A usual security measure in false flags) and LIED ABOUT IT</p></li>
<li><p>They had bomb sniffing dogs all over and failed to sniff out the bombs</p></li>
<li><p>FBI was in contact with the suspect for 2.5 years and LIED ABOUT IT</p></li>
<li><p>If they were buying RDX crystals or PETN to make semtex it would immedietly be noticed by NSA, DHS, or FBI.</p></li>
<li><p>Chechen are﻿ funded by the US</p></li>
</ol>

<p>6.FBI says &quot;dont look at any other pics only ours&quot; while there are more credible pictures being circulated by 4 chan.</p>

<p>WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE AT.</p>

<p>To people claiming them getting into a shootout makes them guilty, thats not the case. Where is the evidence or blasts on the streets from these bombs they were throwing out there window? where are the witnesses to this?? there is not one credible, tangible piece of evidence to tie these 2 men to the bombings, its fucked up. </p>

<p>there is more evidence that 4chans suspects were the bombers then these guys. I just dont like it and they are the perfect patsies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DC madam also &quot;wrote&quot; a letter saying she committed suicide, of course it didn&#39;t matter that friends said that was not her writings, or that just few days earlier she was on the Alex Jones show saying she would never commit suicide and she was absolutely going to fight in the courts, it didn&#39;t matter that statistically a very small portion of woman actually hang themselves and the proffered method of suicide is poison.</p>

<p>Lets not even go that she could have exposed hundreds of high level white house and congress people about prostitution and what not, she committed suicide with a fake writing just days after claiming she won&#39;t commit suicide and after friends and relatives said that wasn&#39;t her writing. </p>

<p>But trust the FBI they are good people that sometimes want to kill children like in the case of Waco.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember it in a law class I took, It was back in 2005 but I remember a video we watched about a former cop turned attorney. He took a case pro bono for some kid that had been charged with murder. The police wrote his confession in this case.</p>

<p>Also when I got arrested, the cops tried to get me to sign a pre-written statement absolving them from entering my house without a warrant.</p>

<p>Also this is what I could come up with in a search.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he has been tried already by a court of public opinion.</p>

<p>They are still calling them &quot;bombing suspects&quot; but they were claiming definitively all day yesterday that the suspects KILLED and officer and robber a 7/11.  There was no allegedly.  The media has told us that he is guilty and most people are already convinced.  Hell, there was a PARADE in boston yesterday when they caught him...</p>

<p>it&#39;s the same parroted language on every channel:</p>

<p>&quot;The suspects&#39; bloody rampage claimed the life of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier, 26, who was found shot to death in his squad car at 10:20 p.m. Thursday in what Davis termed a &quot;vicious assassination.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/20/second-boston-bombing-suspect-in-custody/">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/20/second-boston-bombing-suspect-in-custody/</a></p>

<p>The really interesting thing about this case is the way they are ritualistically using the public.  They managed to gameify the manhunt.  They used the public to &quot;help them find the bomber&quot; (the public was useless there) and by shutting down boston and opening it up at 9 on friday night, they created this amazing climax of conflict and resolution.  Now, they will try him by a jury of his peers and we will al be the jury.  The media will gameify the trial itself.  It&#39;s really amazing to watch this.</p>

<p>edit:  also- according to the media: Moments after the shooting, the brothers carjacked the Mercedes SUV from Third Street in Cambridge and forced the driver to stop at several bank machines to withdraw money. The driver later told police that the brothers had bragged to him that they were the marathon bombers, law enforcement authorities said.</p>

<p>really?  so they are terrorists on the run 4 days later, carjacking people and having them make SEVERAL ATM stops?!  You people realize that can&#39;t possibly be true, right?  But the media says it&#39;s true.  So show us the ATM videos.  There is always an ATM video.  But we will never ever see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Semtex wasn&#39;t used at all, pressure cookers were used. These bombs use gunpowder or other extremely fast combustable powders in to create an enormous amount of pressure inside a strong casing (pressure cookers being ideal).</p>

<p>It&#39;s as simple as filling up a pressure cooker with the powder from fireworks, sealing a broken christmas light inside the hole and attaching it to a clock. If anything the bombs were missing a component though, no shrapnel. This would have made things a hundred times worse. The basic principle is that the combustion of the powder happens so quickly in such a strong container that it saves up a huge amount of energy before the container fails, once it does fail all that energy escapes at once.</p>

<p>But yeah, pressure bombs, not semtex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most evidence they likely have at that point is something that places the suspect in the vicinity of the crime scene/some object or person who could tie him specifically to the crime. Hardly enough to convict a person; enough to see that he is a definite person of interest. Most times, I do not see them lay out their whole case on the news prior to even making an arrest. Also there is a reason that, even now, he is called a suspect. His guilt will be proven in court with, DUN DUN DUNNNNNN, concrete evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you now he isn&#39;t a plant? Have you examined his biology?</p>

<p>Now a false witness, he could easily be one of those. Seriously though, who would volunteer to have his legs blown off so that he could falsely ID a suspect? </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t believe anything the MSM says these days. I don&#39;t even know that he was a victim, much less that there were bombs. I haven&#39;t seen anything that could have been made in a studio with actors. </p>

<p>You keep accusing people here of being sensationalistic, and repeating that you don&#39;t care if his identification was inaccurate, but that is precisely the issue at hand.</p>

<p>So allow me to make a:-</p>

<p>TL;dr- There are three things I could see having happened here:</p>

<p>`1. The story is as the MSM has portrayed it and this poor man saw the suspect plant the bomb, then experience his legs getting blown off, then volunteered this information to police after life saving surgery.</p>

<p>`2. The story is slightly off from the MSM&#39;s portrayal and this poor man did see someone leave a backpack, but was traumatized when his legs were blown off and volunteered to help the police but misidentified a suspect and caused a manhunt for suspicious persons not connected to the bombing who ran for other reasons.</p>

<p>`3. The story is completely fabricated by the MSM. The man is a paraplegic crisis actor planted at the scene to evoke the public&#39;s sympathy and he has provided false testimony to distract the public from the real bombers, be it hired goons, government agents, or terrorist groups. </p>

<p>Sure, I guess I could find that plausible if I was a paranoid schizophrenic.  As a non-delusional adult human who is able to reasonably analyze information, that is clearly a complete fantasy and I feel sorry for anybody who thinks it&#39;s plausible.  </p>

<p>The fact is you don&#39;t know that this whole media event has been planned from start to finish. The bombing, the subsequent spreading of the &quot;terror&quot; by the MSM, the poke at the reloading crowd and gun rights, the gargantuan lockdown and manhunt for one suspect. It very much looks like a script. Just like 9/11.</p>

<p>The MSM is publishing bullshit and retracting it every two seconds. The FBI has tunnel vision and is following only 1 lead. Private military, whose motto is &quot;Violence solves problems&quot; was literally on the scene of the blast! Am I the only one talking about it?</p>

<p>Why do you assume this is the correct suspect. Even if he did throw bombs at the police it doesn&#39;t mean he is guilty of bombing the Boston Marathon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt the news, since it&#39;s an organization. I find it untrustworthy at best.</p>

<p>Ask yourself, &quot;What is an organization?&quot;</p>

<p>Merriam-webster defines it as &quot;an administrative and funtional structure: <em>also</em> the personnel of such a structure.&quot;</p>

<p>I take this to mean three things that sit ill with me.</p>

<p>Firstly - an organization has hierarchy. As an egalitarian, I hate hierarchy. Doubly true when searching for &quot;truth.&quot; Hierarchy inspires mistrust, and thus lies and doubt.</p>

<p>Secondly - an organization has rules. As an outlaw, I hate rules. &quot;Do what you want&quot; should be the only rule. I hate when people tell me what to do. Especially when it&#39;s for &quot;my own good.&quot; <strong>I</strong> decide &quot;my own good.&quot; Who is someone else to tell me different.
All rules do is criminalize the innocent.</p>

<p>And thirdly (and I believe most importantly,) an organization is comprised of individuals. &quot;A chain is only as strong as it&#39;s weakest link.&quot; Assembling a congregation of individuals, giving them a hierarchy and rules almost guarantees mistakes to be made and lies to be told.</p>

<p>All in all, I think 4chan (a loosely knit group of individuals, <em>not</em> an organization, and reddit have done a reasonable job of assembling a list of suspects. The former moreso than the latter perhaps. (<em>sorry guys!</em>)</p>

<p>All the FBI managed to do is provide two photographs of one suspect and instruct the public to put on a blindfold. Hardly good investigative work.</p>

<p>On a side note, have you forgotten how good the FBI is at entrapment? <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fbi+terrorism+entrapment">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fbi+terrorism+entrapment</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, but I do think I needed to the actual definition of an organization. Just about everyone is part of one, and if a doctor says &quot;you have diabetes and need an insulin pump&quot;, you don&#39;t get a second opinion from your neighbor who has 0 medical training and trust his word over someone who went to school to get the qualification/skills/experience to diagnose you.</p>

<p>While it may not apply to all things, like I said before, in cases such as these damn right I would trust an organizations word before some strangers! At least when the FBI says they have a suspect, you know they have people who had to have experience in investigations like this rather than just trusting other individuals simply because they share your opinion. </p>

<p>Yes I know the FBI is good at entrapment, and I also know individuals can be full of shit, paranoid, arrogant, self absorbed, etc etc - that&#39;s why we see so many self-help books around. Rules don&#39;t criminalize the innocent, rules are guide lines- laws are debatable, but that comes down to who makes the laws, and that wouldn&#39;t be the FBI.</p>

<p>I gave you the definition of organization a few comments back to put a context to our discussion, but since you seem to have missed that I suggest you go back and check it out. </p>

<p>Organizations as &quot;administrative and functional structures&quot; are useless, <strong>not</strong> bad.

<p>In my own history, I&#39;ve found far more examples of competent individuals than competent organizations. Is it neccesary that I should make a list of the former for you, that you should make a list of the latter and let&#39;s compare? I do not think this necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this conversation had gone on long enough for you to know you just explained you don&#39;t trust organizations because of people, individuals, who work in them are incompetent. I was arguing that you would be much less likely to find reliable information from individuals, specifically information relating to the Boston Bombers or most murder cases, than you would be able to from organizations from the FBI. </p>

<p>To spell it out, your basically just saying you don&#39;t trust any individual person by reasoning no organization can be trusted due to the unreliability of the individuals involved. So, either <em>everyone</em> is useless, or a group of specifically trained individuals would be slightly less &quot;useless&quot; than one regular jack off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you misunderstand me.</p>

<p>I am saying that an organization, as a conglomeration of competent and incompetent individuals, is less competent than an individual. And further, that a non-organized volunteer group, such as 4-chan or reddit, is more trustworthy than an authoritarian organization that is known to be corrupt, such as the FBI.</p>

<p>To further my point, consider the fact that the entirety of Boston&#39;s militarized police force was at the disposal of the FBI; yet it was one individual citizen who found the suspect.</p>

<p>Not everyone is useless, unless they are burdened by the hierarchies and regulations of a &quot;functional and administrative&quot; organization.</p>

<p>I am all for people voluntarily organizing to solve problems. But when people are stuck in the muck of bureaucracy, they are less apt to actually solve anything.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust organizations as functional administrative structure, because I don&#39;t believe in hierarchies or rules. </p>

<p>These guys robbed liquor stores and shot an MIT cop they obviously wanted to get caught.  When they were caught they had a gun fight and tried to through a bomb.</p>

<p>Why then run and hide? What was he going to do wait till things blew over?</p>

<p>The younger brother gets away by driving at the police. </p>

<p>This now justifies placing a population of 400,000 on lock down, forced entry searches on a massive scale.   Keep in mind these guys are just suspects because like this post points out there is not evidence presented to us yet......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of questions for the OP.</p>

<p>1) Who said they were using SEMTEX? I can&#39;t find any article which even references it. Where are you getting your information?</p>

<p>2) In regards to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They had bomb sniffing dogs all over and failed to sniff out the bombs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it is a 26.2 mile race and the largest in the world with over 500,000 spectators and 20,000 participants so I think it&#39;s reasonable to conclude that you can&#39;t lock down and find every possible bomb that might be placed. Bomb/Drug sniffing dogs have an <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/legal-challenge-questions-reliability-police-dogs">alarmingly high failure rate</a>. They are not an end all solution but an aid in finding something a human might miss. Which then requires further human investigation. </p>

<p>3) This is not really a question to you but this...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chechen are﻿ funded by the US</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you mean the US provides assistance in the form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development">USAID program</a> and other programs some of which might be back-channel. You might be interested to know that a ton of countries receive aid from the US. Chechnya is so low on the list it doesn&#39;t even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Recipients">make the top 25</a>. </p>

<p>I feel like I could keep picking away at what you wrote but I&#39;d rather give you a chance to respond with sources because right now I feel some of your claims are dubious at best. </p>

<p>This is false. The FBI did not lie about it because they didn&#39;t know the identity of the bombers when footage was released. It was not until after their identities were determined that it came to light the FBI had interview Suspect #1 before.</p>

<p>These guys had no reason to do anything. they were fucking Americans dam it. 
If these two had anything to do with it they wouldn&#39;t have stayed in Boston
And they sure as hell wouldn&#39;t be at711 after having their pictures released. </p>

<p>The cop at MIT who was killed? Why? Its crazy to think they would do that just randomly.</p>

<p>There is no proof of this car chase or shootout. No photos of them at MIT. No photos of them with any kind of weapons or bombs etc. The bags didn&#39;t match either.</p>

<p>So were supposed to believe these terrorists carried 7 pressure cooker bombs on 2 backpacks? Reaaally?</p>

<p>If these guys were terrorists I bet they would have killed more than 3 people. This was done to cause fear not casualties. </p>

<p>Every person who knew these guys said they were great people and were leaders, and volunteers.</p>

<p>Sorrry, but this smells of bullshit.</p>

Many reports state that they have separated themselves in the last 2 years from family and friends. The older brother was already questioned by Russian investigators and FBI about a possible connection to Al Quida. His YouTube channel has a playlist with a lot of crazy Islamic shit including some video many terrorists use as a calling to killing infadels. This all adds up for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite frankly, if it came out that these two weren&#39;t the bomber, the city and family would have one hell of a lawsuit against the military/FBI for numerous reasons. For legal purposes alone, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d admit any mistakes once tanks are rolling through a city on lock down.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily disbelieve that the 19y/o pictured was on the boat, but Let&#39;s hypothesize this guy is not the bomber.
Imagine that this guy is you.
You wake up one morning to find out the freaking FBI put your picture on blast, telling an entire nation that you&#39;re the bomber because you wore a backpack to an event.
You don&#39;t have a getaway plan, much less enough money to put one together in 24 hours. 
City goes into lock down and tanks are filling the streets.
What do you do?</p>

<p>You sit your ass down in the back of a boat that hasn&#39;t been moved in awhile and shit yourself until your brain comprehends the timewarp your week just took. 
&quot;Come out on your own terms&quot; yell the authorities, weapons drawn. 
You have deja vu of your brother being shot the night before.
Fuck that! 
<sup><sup><sup>^</sup></sup></sup>
That validates eye witnesses who claim to have seen him being pulled out of the boat since no clear videos/photos exist WITHOUT supporting the FBIs claim that he is the bomber/a valid suspect. It&#39;s also a believable reason for a young man to hide from police since people argue &quot;if he wasn&#39;t guilty, why did he run?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI hires the 2 kids to act the part of bombers for the drill. They are shown the insides of their backpacks so they know they are only carrying used books. The real bomb is planted by the older guy in blue with the knapsack with the stripes on the straps. The FBI pins it on the Muslims (ex-Russians for bonus points) and gains further psychological reasons to invade Muslim areas (Syria, Iran) to gain oil, minerals and markets. Rights are removed from Americans. This bombing seems very similar to the bus and train bombings in London.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until the photo of the older brother circulating online that those in the medical field viewing it started pointing out that his injuries were inconsistent with reports. They were saying that his injuries were consistent with being ran over and hung upside down postmortem. I heard nothing on the radio about the younger brother driving over him- but even so, that wouldn&#39;t explain the part about being hung upside down. He was alive just hours prior to the photo, so it&#39;s not like he was taken to this overcrowded morgue where a coroner had to stick him in a freezer like cattle to be processed. </p>

<p>OP is right we haven&#39;t seen jack shit for proof. I am willing to accept these kids did it. But the FBI has been known to <a href="http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2013/02/08/oakland-bomb-plot-raises-questions-of-entrapment">falsify bomb threats</a> in the past.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re getting downvoted (I probably will too) but there is NO tangible evidence of them shooting at police. I had a buddy and his sister of mine call conspiracy theorists &quot;boring without conspiracy&quot; &quot;wahh&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorists are bandwagoners&quot; and this was directed towards me and another group of friends who genuinely don&#39;t feel like anything adds up. And if you look at it in hindsight it really doesn&#39;t. There is no evidence, about ANYTHING, and that makes me feel bad for the two who are suspects. They are innocent until proven guilty, but so many people are bloodthirsty. They want to see them killed, but for why? What the news reported to be true even though there is evidence that they have been changing their stories? It&#39;s a load of bullshit. And no I&#39;m not trying to come as a conspiracy nut, I just genuinely don&#39;t feel like anything the media says is true. And a police state? The fuck? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Picture of what? It&#39;s not like investigating is so easy that there is always a picture o someone red handed - it&#39;s more like a pattern of events and changes that result in the assumed reason for doing what they did. FBI has been all over their facebook/twitter accounts, heard from people who knew them, and we&#39;ve had reporters interview relatives of theirs. After that younger brother gets questioned we&#39;ll hopefully get some more answers, but don&#39;t expect a picture of a guy placing a pack on the ground with a sign of their name in bold print above them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this just confuses me more.   isn&#39;t part of the story that the younger brother got away during the &quot;firefight&quot;.  despite the fact that Apache fucking helicopters where on the scene yet it was &quot;too foggy&quot;.   now i didn&#39;t buy this for one second.  we all watch cops we know what type of cameras helicopters are equipped with and those are just local police.  i can only imagine what a military copter has.   and here this picture shows that fog wouldn&#39;t have mattered.......help im confused </p>
