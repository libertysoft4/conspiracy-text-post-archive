        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In this cctv video that the FBI released.  (<a href="http://youtu.be/DN_Vzgdxof8?t=1m26s">http://youtu.be/DN_Vzgdxof8?t=1m26s</a>) There was something suspicious that got my attention.
The guy standing at the door face was blurred out. Note that he is figgling with his ear piece as these guys walk by him. The lady with the yellow balloons face was blurred out too. Was she a marker to allow the government agencies easily follow them by tracking the bright yellow balloons? Watch how she suddenly stops and i&#39;m convinced she is watching them as they walk away.</p>

<p>Why blur their faces and no-one else?</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that these bombers were followed.</p>

<p>It means some government agency knew about them and did not stop them.</p>

<p>...just before I pressed submit I remembered something about the balloons. I saw it in the original bombing video. Just watch it floating away immediately after the 1st explosion. (<a href="http://youtu.be/7l447UT3rtM">http://youtu.be/7l447UT3rtM</a>)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen loads of crowd photos and I don&#39;t recall seeing any balloons. Examples below:

<p>Absolutely no balloons in the crowd. Yet we see the balloons following these men to the bombing sites. It&#39;s bright and yellow and easily tracked. The presence of these military guys that many of you have pointed out ties into that too imo.</p>

<p>Not sure whats going on but the bombers were definitely tracked imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those balloons looked like they blew away because they were let go by a victim, or someone affected by their proximity to the blast. Them flying away explains the rest of the crowd shots, does it not? I am sorry, but how does someone with balloons and a blurred face = the government knew and didnt stop it? those are not even close to related or likely...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She appears to be holding the balloons below shoulder height. That would explain why you can&#39;t see them behind walls of people.</p>

<p>She&#39;s also walking <strong>in front of them</strong>. She also stops and looks at <strong>what everyone else is looking at</strong>: the <strong>marathon</strong>.</p>

<p>Why they blurred her face, I do not know. Possibly because her face was clearly visible, while the other faces on the screen were more or less obscured, and they didn&#39;t have her around to sign a release? Maybe we should ask someone who works for a news team why that would be, rather than fabricating cockamamy theories about the FBI trying to signal where the Tsarnaev brothers were with the help of an <strong>overweight woman holding yellow balloons</strong>.</p>

<p>Jumping to &quot;she was the signal because they were following them&quot; is pretty baseless conjecture, but you know, whatever. Having a conspiracy without baseless conjecture is having a meat pie without all the bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would imagine that it&#39;s when they decided people&#39;s faces were more clearly identifiable.  The doorway guy&#39;s face is not blurred when they come around the corner and are walking towards cam, but blurred when they are walking away from cam.  If they were so concerned about protected doorway guy&#39;s identity, why not blur it constantly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Balloons can be a simple way for people to find each other in large crowds, which means it could be nothing. However, Letting go of the balloons at a time when you would want most for your friends/family to find you is strange. </p>

<p>If this was a setup, could she have been a handler leading them to the staging area and telling them they can find her with the balloons. The bombs go off balloons go away and guys have no way to get back to the people who lead them there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of related, though may be a shot in the dark, today at Civic Center Park in Denver, CO there was a minor shooting at a massive 420 rally. In this video you can clearly see a bright yellow balloon in the midst of the crowd: 
<a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AKFd40d4PiE">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AKFd40d4PiE</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video of the shooting for proof it happened, the news hasn&#39;t really reported on it.

<p>In addition to the yellow balloons he also had the &quot;sun&quot; balloon with him. In the original explosion video the sun balloon was not floating away with the others.</p>

<p>Yellow Balloon Lady had 4 balloons and the original explosion video appears to be 4 balloons. The black guy is holding six.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right. I do not believe that balloon lady was at the 2nd site though, and the yellow is a jacket that a man is wearing and you can even see he has a white cap as well. This is most likely one of the event coordinators or helpers or photographers as from what I&#39;ve seen they were wearing yellow jackets in order to distinguish themselves from the rest of the crowd.</p>

<p>So there is no balloons at the 2nd site, though I concur about what you said about the balloons and that it could have been used to easily track them.</p>
