        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Gold recently took a dive (along with silver and other precious metals). Over the last few months it has lost 17% of its value, and is currently sitting below $1500 per ounce. A lot of investors are selling, and gold could go down further. </p>

<p>The mainstream media has been pushing the narrative that gold is on its way down <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100533043">http://www.cnbc.com/id/100533043</a>
However, as this article acknowledges (<a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100022953/golds-death-cross-is-a-buy-signal-for-china/">http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100022953/golds-death-cross-is-a-buy-signal-for-china/</a>), the central banks around the world are buying gold at a rate not seen since 1964.</p>

<p>I was interested to read recently that the Comex gold inventory has decreased by an unprecedented amount in the last 90 days <a href="http://bullmarketthinking.com/comex-gold-inventories-collapse-by-largest-amount-on-record/">http://bullmarketthinking.com/comex-gold-inventories-collapse-by-largest-amount-on-record/</a>  - there might be different ways to interpret this, but to me the most obvious way of looking at this is that the big-time gold-owners are looking to take physical possession of their gold.</p>

<p>Then I read this interview from December 2012 with a DHS insider. I have no way of verifying this, but it makes for interesting reading. He says that the US financial collapse will be preceeded by a dip in the price of precious metals <a href="http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/52005">http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/52005</a>  which would be happening about now... in the Spring... as he predicted...</p>

<p>So here is the conspiracy theory: The crash is coming. Soon. And the ‘elites’ know it. The dollar is going to lose all or most of its value. Gold (not paper gold, but physical gold) will be king, but only if you have it in your possession (no good having it in some facility somewhere, you need to have it somewhere that you can actually access it). </p>

<p>The gold market is being manipulated to come down as far as possible in price so that nervous investors sell off, and the central banks and ‘elites’ can buy up at pennies on the dollar. Then, when the crash happens, they own almost all of the wealth. </p>

<p>This would explain the decrease in the Comex gold inventory, the fact that the central banks are buying up gold, the fact that the mainstream media is pushing the narrative that gold is going down and that the economy is improving. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying its a conspiracy. Its not some ancient cabal of billionaires buying up the reserves. Im saying that gold is ridiculously overvalued.</p>

<p>Fear drives the value of gold up. Part of that fear is generated by fear-mongerig conspiracy theorists and get-rich-quick scammers trying to convince everyone that the economy is collapsing. You cant drive down a metropolitan street without a hand-drawn sign or a new business flying banners saying &quot;We buy gold!&quot; </p>

<p>So as a result, people buy gold, thinking that its going to save them from quantitative easing, skyrocketing inflation or the potential collapse of the economy. Supply and demand dictates that if there is more demand, the value of that product will go up. But the demand is generated by incorrect information. So far the things that the fearmongers warned about has not happened. </p>

<p>Paul van Eeden, president of Cranberry Capital says that the true value of gold should actually be around $900/oz:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, after the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Bank announced the first round of quantitative easing. The gold price started to rally because there was an expectation, with the Fed openly engaging in quantitative easing, that we would see massive U.S. dollar inflation. But that didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>When the Fed engages in quantitative easing, it does so by buying assets in the open market, such as Treasury notes or bonds. When the Fed buys a government bond in the open market it creates the money to pay for it out of thin air. The payment is credited against a commercial bank&#39;s account at the Federal Reserve Bank and is not available for commerce in the economy. It&#39;s part of the monetary base, but not the money supply, as the money supply only counts money that can be used for commerce.</p>

<p>Thus, the money that the Fed creates is not in circulation. It&#39;s not part of the money supply because it cannot be spent. The commercial bank in whose name it is credited cannot withdraw it. The only thing it can do is to create new loans against that reserve asset. But the bank can only create new loans equal to the demand for such new loans.</p>

<p>Right now, as a result of QE1 and QE2, there is an enormous amount of excess reserves on account at the Federal Reserve on behalf of these commercial banks. These excess reserves in theory could be used to create new loans. The reality is that new loan creation by commercial banks have proceeded at a very normal pace, and not at all at a rate that should cause fear of hyperinflation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theaureport.com/pub/na/14790">http://www.theaureport.com/pub/na/14790</a></p>

<p>So what is happening is the market is correcting itself. Im sure Alex Jones and rest of the tinfoil-hatted blowhards will say its because of the Rothschilds evil doings - devaluing gold so the average consumer wont want to buy it, thus allowing the Rothschilds to buy even more gold for themselves, but so far no one has been able to accurately explain to me just how that whole conspiracy theory even holds water.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here&#39;s Alex saying pretty much what I expected him to say:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/gold-collapse-the-bubble-is-pricked/">http://www.infowars.com/gold-collapse-the-bubble-is-pricked/</a></p>

<p>And here&#39;s an article from January saying EXACTLY what I figured:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gold Fiasco happening right exposes State propaganda about the markets and the Economy. True economic principles still hold for those who know economics. Gold should go up against this hyper inflation we are seeing because printing money just causes inflation and devalues a currency., and when this happens people will flock to gold and other real assets.Pumping free money into the stock market will cause bubble and make stock prices too expensive, and bubbles will always burst. Poor people can&#39;t have demand either, therefore the economy will fall into depression. Anything that defies basic principles is all lies, and  increase in lies, and obvious propaganda should worry people unless they are part of the lie. The manipulation of Gold = Manipulation of the free man.</p>

<p>One major point is that since gold was very low in price for a long time there was less prospecting and mine development going on then there would have been otherwise.  So now a lot of these will be popping online as time goes on.  I still don&#39;t think it will be anywhere near enough to keep the price down.  To throw out a very rough number you will be wanting to get out of gold in say 10-15 years.  For now gobble that shit up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a bit of guess work since really we are living in a distorted economy with an enormous amount of the people living in intense illusion.  So you have to do the equations in your head to try and guess the rate at which people will be waking up and the rate at which the system will collapse.  I believe that people will be waking up and that the system will collapse and that I have only educated guess work to go on as to the exact timings.  If you can time the waves of peak illusion and disillusion and peak bubble and pops as they meet then you can do very well.  Some people think that things will go to the worst and they buy guns.  Still guns have been a good investment even now with zero need to use them.</p>

<p>The government can make certain investments less liquid by outlawing them or heavily regulating them.  Guns could be banned and while good to have it would make it either more difficult or dangerous to buy and sell.  I suspect that gold and silver will simply be regulated with government disclosure limits set pretty damn low.  So then how large of a solid and non-treacherous support network will you have?  These are all gambles in a sense.  I think that paper will ultimately be a big lose but even then at moments if enough people are still in massive illusion then it can be somehow still valuable.  There could be a period of confusion where the shelves go empty but people still aren&#39;t bright enough to accept gold and silver.  We are very acustomed to fully stocked shelves full of things that we can&#39;t afford but it could easily go towards fat wads of cash and empty shelves.</p>

<p>So to throw another concept out there you have price controls in an inflationary environment - something that I believe will one day occur, simply because historically it has been exceedingly common in a hyperinflationary environment.  That equals empty shelves.</p>

<p>So gosh, lots of things can and will happen at different stages of the economical breakdown.  I like gold and silver but I am increasingy aware that I might need to put on a smile and appear poor and barely able for potentially a long time while I hold steady.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t...</p>

<p>Yes it does, phase one would be entirely to the detriment of the elite with your goal in mind, and phase two (as phase one) would accomplish everything faster, more efficiently, and with less risk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cheaper gold is, the more real gold they get for the paper they give them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter, in your theory this is a coup d&#39;etat by the wealthy to acquire real wealth leaving the poor with fiat.</p>

<p>Your phase one only risks real wealth being given to the poor in exchange for a smaller amount of (worthless) fiat.  This would be what they call counter-intuitive.  To make matters worse, phase one has no bearing on the success of phase two, making it not only detrimental but redundant.  It makes your end-game less plausible by encouraging purchasing before selling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you read a chart on a price of gold or any given stock, and the stock stands straight up like a ladder, there is no support and the ladder falls. Things that go straight up go straight down. These are some basic rules of the game. The charts do not lie , the way they work they have to build a baseline - a support level. When they go up and peak its called a resistance level. I recommend reading a few books on charting stocks like candlesticks which is eastern tech analysis and then you have western technical analysis. I would not be selling physical gold. The government repeatedly prints money and pushes the market ever higher. (Devalue of the US dollar) If a stock market crash occurs then the king dollar comes back. Go lay some gold charts over the sp500 a ticker symbol would by SPY and then lay GLD over the top of it and look it. Fuck what these reports say about this and that Figures do not lie but LIARS figure and they want your gold!!!  Start the chart in 2005 I would also hold physical gold that does not tie your social security number to it!!!</p>

That also means you can devalue currencies and print as much money as you want and that will make Fools believe that  their paper is worth more than Gold. By devaluing Gold to the public, they cut gold demand, and at the same time devaluing the dollar, the purchasing power of the average American. In Gold, Elites  will always have their safe money,  Because smart people know worthless  greenbacks cant buy you food. Simple as that. Gold is the universal currency, who would refuse gold payments? Nobody. So next time you buy the lies and bullshit propaganda, ask yourself how much barrels of greenback will i need to buy bread? and in that situation what merchant would ever accept dollars over gold?None. Gold cannot be devalued, what you see happening right now is only artificial  manipulation to create reserves for the rich, and quietly scheming banksters. When the shit hits the fan, you will know what the scheme really was , and Gold will have its value, unaffordable to you,  of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if it ever got as bad as you said why would anyone accept gold either. If we are talking total economic collapse why would the merchant accept gold at all? They would have use for it in the short term. People would trade in gas, food, clothes, what ever they had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t take my word for it. Think. You don&#39;t print money, and you don&#39;t control the value of your money.  You could wake up tomorrow and your dollar can become worthless. Bernanke can do that with a flick of a pen. In such a situation, what asset holds its purchasing power? in 1800, an ounce of Gold would buy an awesome lavish night in the finest hotel. Today an ounce of Gold will still buy you an awesome night a five star hotel.  Drop an ounce of gold at any lavish hotel in New York or London,  I will assure no one will complain about your form of payment. </p>

<p>The price of gold is denominated in US dollars, so the higher the price of Gold, the more worthless the Dollar becomes. The important thing is, when prices of Gold skyrocket over night, you will need much more dollars to get it. Who will have 3000$ or Even 5000 for an ounce of gold? get it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I have just started looking online at stores in my area (Tampa) and most seem to be quite small and their advertising leans towards buying rather than selling.</p>

<p>If you wanted to buy 5 thousand dollars in silver dimes and quarters, would a small local coin shop be the place to do that?</p>
