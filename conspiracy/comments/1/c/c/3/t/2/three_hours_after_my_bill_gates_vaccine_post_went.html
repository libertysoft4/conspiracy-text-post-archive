<p>TIL post by CorruptEagle: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1caxk8/til_that_bill_gates_has_saved_over_five_million/">TIL that Bill Gates has saved over five million lives by &quot;bringing vaccines and improved healthcare to children internationally&quot;.</a></p>

<p>Now I just need to find that other thread about vaccines I found a few weeks ago that was in either <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, or <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> that had a MASS of &quot;Comment removed&quot; posts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing my account was brute-forced, since the censorship came via deletion rather than reddit&#39;s moderation abilities which appear as &quot;Comment removed&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree voting on comments is an incredibly successful way of curating content which is why reddit is so successful and so sticky. What you&#39;re objecting to is that this like any system can be gamed, and it reflects the base instincts of the herd. Now I&#39;ve thought about that and what I think is this. Voting should be transparent. You should be prepared to put your money where your mouth is when you vote something up and down. This also allows for an evolution in the engine. So for example RES could allow you to remove the votes of people suspected of gaming the system.  The key here is you still have curation but it becomes impossible to control what people are seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, if people are putting their &quot;names&quot; out there when giving an opinion, then anyone who disagrees will have their name out there too. Actually, it&#39;s against Reddiquette to downvote a comment simply because you disagree with someone, only if the comment breaks a rule or isn&#39;t part of the discussion. Other social media sites let you see who &quot;upvotes&quot; something, but hardly any of them have a &quot;downvote&quot; like Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your disagreement, but upvoted anyway cause I kinda agree. Though this voting system may be a &#39;successful&#39; way of curating content, the problem is it is geared to, as you said, reflect the base instincts of the herd. As a new redditor, i actually thought the system worked against such ignorant herd mentality, but that delusion quickly faded. Any hope for it was obliterated when I found out you can <a href="http://buyredditvotes.com/">buy upvotes</a>. Upvotes mean jack shit.   </p>

<p>Putting your money where your mouth is sounds like a pretty good idea but I think trusting the user base to read through lists of names and accurately prune out bad votes would make it even easier to game. Conspiratard would have a new toy to play with. You should be required to either post a comment along with your down vote or select a valid reason congruent to the rules from a drop list. OP could then challenge certain down votes and attempt to get a mod to remove them. </p>

<p>This is all a pipedream though, since upvotes can be bought and in a way that fact is the proof in the pudding. Reddit has been compromised by commercialism. Maybe we could rally to restrict purchased votes to the front page/certain subreddits....?         </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The site build is easy. Super easy. There are more than enough people with the skills and desire to make alternatives. The issue comes with the community. In an effort to allow open and free conversation tracking and moderation have to be kept at a minimum, and people will immediately take advantage of the complete lack of censorship. Posting child porn, or near child porn images, extreme and obviously fake racism (murder black babies, etc. ), and other means of implicating the site itself in &quot;illegal&quot; or at least reportable behavior. So you begin with at least some censorship, and it snowballs from their. For instance, I personally wouldn&#39;t allow people to argue whether or not 9/11 was bullshit. You could argue exactly how it was bullshit, but denying the lie would be an immediate ban. </p>

The enemy (those that perpetuate ignorance as a weapon to manufacture consent) alwaus have and always will cower behind ingorance for either plausible deniability or some other feign, and thus ultimate tolerance is counter productive. Think about that - I didn&#39;t say it&#39;s a weakness, I said it&#39;s counter productive.</p>

My point was that the original poster was pro-info suppression.  I agree, people need to be educated, but you kept taking the discussion in a different direction.  My point was about the fact that knowing about possible dangers is important, and saying that info needs to be regulated to protect people from themselves is a dumb argument.  Info shouldn&#39;t be suppressed, people just need better education.  Let&#39;s focus on the more valuable goal.<br/>
Suppression=control of meek and sheepish people=shitty society.  Education=equality and higher quality of life for everyone. </p>

<p>If you start controlling information, and not tell people they are, will they just magically know?  Just because you know, don&#39;t assume others do.  Our government/politicians have been extremely successful at destroying our education system and keeping the masses ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, best colleges...we also have the worst for-profit online diploma mills that screw the same ignorant people I mention before. 
Dubai has one of the most modern cities, surrounded by massive poverty.  Just because it exists, doesn&#39;t mean all&#39;s fair and equal.  Opportunity is just that.  Try visiting an innercity school that has 10 computers where 3 actually work.  Meanwhile, the neighborhood is such shit that the ISP don&#39;t offer enough bandwidth thus the area of town the school is in basically has no internet.   </p>

<p>&quot;we have the best quality of living amongst the world&quot; You&#39;re delusional.  This may be true, IF you can afford it. We have less equality than Cameroon, Iran, the Ivory Coast, Mali, Laos, Kosovo... The list goes on (source: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html</a>)  So... your argument is again flawed.</p>

<p>&quot;develop better everything than everyone else&quot; Yep, just like Imperial England, Spain, etc.  When you have slaves and wage slaves, it&#39;s not too hard to be on top of the development ladder. However, you could argue Japan and Korea develop just as good of &quot;things&quot;. It would have to be things, because it sure as fuck isn&#39;t education (we rank 17th).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fart in the bubble you live in.   </p>

<li><p>Online Diploma mills have to be sought out by dipshits. It requires absolutely no effort to get into one except to give people money. That&#39;s on the people using them, not on the country. I don&#39;t know what the point of bringing up Dubai is. </p></li>
<li><p>Those inner city schools have computers. They&#39;re still leagues ahead of other countries. You realize that the fact that they have computers is an accomplishment, right? It&#39;s not up to par with a lot of other parts of the country, but they still have them. I have worked at inner-city schools. I get it. And, really, the ISP doesn&#39;t offer bandwidth? Really? Because the neighborhood is such shit? Where did you get all of your network engineering schooling? </p></li>
<li><p>Equality is not quality of living, dipshit. Also, holy fuck, are you seriously trying to say that Laos is better than America? Have you fucking been there, asshole? My family is FROM THERE. Equality of wealth is not an indicator of fucking shit if your economy sucks dick and your entire understanding of manufacturing and production comes from the 1800&#39;s. You&#39;re oversimplifying your understanding of how quality of living works because you&#39;re too stupid to grasp the complexities of it. </p></li>
<li><p>Slave wages? And Slaves? Nobody forces anybody into those occupations. One of the greatest things about America is that you get all of the fruits of your efforts. And no you can&#39;t. Japan and Korea refine technology but America is still leading in the development of developing technology. Again, technology is only one aspect. We lead in medicine and technology and research. PS, I&#39;m an engineer. Don&#39;t pretend that you somehow have an education in technology, retard.</p></li>
<li><p>Education rankings are horse shit. In China and Japan, you have to qualify to even get onto those census scales. If you can&#39;t cut it, you don&#39;t get to be in the education system. They don&#39;t report their education. You really think a country like China who has never given anybody full disclosure would fully disclose that information? Grow the fuck up, asshole. And the educational index doesn&#39;t mean fucking shit. You have to look at the human development index. That is the important one. And America ranks at #3, right behind Australia and Norway. Both of which have a population that can fit into New York. So that makes it incredibly easier to have a higher index of human development. America has over 10x the population of Australia and almot 100x the population of Norway. On top of that the population diversity is infinitely more and that comes with so many more issues. </p></li>

<p>So you&#39;re wrong and stupid. Congrats. </p>

<p>Still not. They still have homes they are subsidized in. They still have foodstamps. They still eat and live. It&#39;s shitty quality, but it&#39;s still better than lots of European (I use europe because it&#39;s the closest thing) where social welfare isn&#39;t even a thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your gini? What the fuck is a gini? </p>

<p>First of all, the only people who could use computers were the ones who bought them. They didn&#39;t even have a computer lab at my school and I graduated in &#39;04. They still don&#39;t. My brother just finished there. And this is the highest rated high school in the city. It&#39;s got Blue Ribbon awards and all that shit.</p>

<p>You have a lab. That works. Grow up. Oh so you tried 1 thing and it didn&#39;t work. Man you are quite the genius. I&#39;m a network engineer, don&#39;t start getting into a debate about computer shit with me. You&#39;re in over your head there. Making requests is the equivalent of upvoting. It means shit all. </p>

<p>Regardless of the funding cuts and whatever else, we still sit prettier than the rest of the world. Things I don&#39;t know about? Holy fuck you, asshole. My family is 1st generation into this fucking amazing country. My dad lived alone in a hut outside of the major city by himself at the age of 6 with a bunch of other 6 year olds so he could go to the 1 school that allowed them to attend. They lived, unsupervised, by themselves with barely enough food to go around so they could take turns using the only book, pencil and paper they owned to go to the only school within 100 miles. And this is one of your &quot;equality&quot; is higher than US countries you mentioned. Fuck you and your privileged life. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t discount shit. Just saying you&#39;re wrong.  </p>

<li><p>the Gates foundation openly acknowledges the problems with the OPV vaccine, but it is currently the only practical possibility for complete polio eradication, given that it is orally administered</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio">http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio</a></p>

<p>&quot;OPV, the polio vaccine used in most of the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But OPV consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases—1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine—can cause paralysis. In settings with very low OPV coverage, OPV vaccine viruses can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population, just like wild polioviruses.</p>

<p>We support the development of new OPV formulations that are not associated with the risk of mutation as well as vaccine alternatives to OPV. One of the most promising alternatives is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is routinely used in most developed countries but has not been broadly used elsewhere because of its higher cost and the need to have a trained provider administer it by injection. We support efforts to lower the cost of IPV and put in place the training, supply, delivery, and communications infrastructure to expand its use. We also support efforts to develop antiviral drugs to respond to a future accidental or intentional reintroduction of poliovirus in the post-eradication era.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure there&#39;s information on the Gates Foundation website about how the vaccine can be harmful for 1 in 2.7 million people. That makes it sound pretty unlikely for the majority, right? But then if someone posts an article where it shows that the vaccine is causing lots of deaths (on order of magnitude more than 1 in 2.7 million, and those posts are getting downvoted into oblivion, then that&#39;s a conspiracy to silence information. If the Gates Foundation is funding mass production and distribution of the old vaccine and not the new IPV one, then this is an important distinction in the story. In essence they would be causing those deaths by paying for the inferior vaccine. Should they just be paying for the better vaccine? Or have they done some kind of numbers analysis and decided it&#39;s ok if a few children die for the greater good of the many?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good question, and from what I can read, the answer doesn&#39;t seem to be simple either.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.polioeradication.org/Research/Frequentlyaskedquestions.aspx">An advantage given on the faq on the polioeradication site is</a>: </p>

<p>Unlike OPV, IPV confers very little immunity in the intestinal tract. When a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus or a cVDPV, virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the stool, risking continued circulation. For this reason, OPV is the vaccine of choice wherever a polio outbreak needs to be stopped.</p>

<p>So in areas with poor hygiene/sanitation (which is even more expensive to provide well), OPV has an advantage in preventing outbreaks...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re taking an extreme tunnel vision view of the problem by just focussing on Polio eradication. That effectively solves nothing because the kids will eventually still die of starvation or some other disease due to bad water or poor hygiene/sanitation. I&#39;d rather they focussed on providing clean water, proper hygiene/sanitation, then giving them the ability to grow food or become self sufficient. These are the main issues, then they can issue the IPV vaccine. I think the strategy of what World Vision or Tear Fund do is much better than the Gates Foundation approach of only focussing on vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracies are rarely about denying information but about minimising its impact by burying it and marginalising it. These sorts of conspiracies happen without anyone necessarily organising anything. If you work in an organisation you instinctively protect that organisation, if you work in the media you instinctively know the stories that no one wants to touch. In this case the Gates Foundation is a good news story - no one wants to do a proper investigation into their Monsanto investments or the potential for problems with large scale vaccination programs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there is no doubt that there are many in positions of power globally who are dishonest, or outright dangerous and evil, I&#39;m just not convinced this applies to the Gates Foundation.  The reasons are that it&#39;s a pretty simple agenda - the guy was the richest man in the world, and he wants to leave a legacy.  Plus he employs many smart, dedicated and passionate people - these are not people looking to make more money, they want to make things better.  I&#39;ve no reason to think he intends to cut corners in making that happen, but even $50 billion goes so far when you&#39;re trying to eradicate global diseases.</p>

<p>And the reason you detected irony in population &quot;control&quot; is because it is seen as a threat only because of the local damages it causes to people themselves - look at desertification, the war in Rwanda etc.  All caused by environmental destruction and overpopulation.  However I seriously doubt such control is being done by malicious introduction of diseases by the Gates Foundation (although if you want a real conspiracy theory, how about the one that Henry Kissinger started AIDS?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much the irony. That and everything else that makes uncontrolled population growth so much more of a threat and a detriment to quality of life. Not to mention that population growth is the key to inflating currencies and keeping economic growth moving (and allowing for further fleecing by economic alphas).</p>

<p>I agree about Gates. I really don&#39;t see anything malicious in what he does. Maybe not 100% perfect but everything has bugs in the system and takes time to perfect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some people would argue it isn&#39;t. I think though its still a conspiracy because it is both deliberate and unconscious. That might seem to be contradictory but it isn&#39;t when you think about it. The world is driven out of survival people instinctively acting on perceived self-interest. If you are in a duopoly position you don&#39;t compete with the other player because both of you would lose you don&#39;t need to actively conspire it is implicit in the situation nevertheless it is still deliberate. Power is always in the business of making choices that perpetuate power - which is both obvious, often unconscious and a conspiracy against the weak. Often when self-interest is at stake we choose not to think too hard. A colleague at work gives you advance notice of an opportunity at work neglecting to tell other people who could benefit this is all that is at the heart of a conspiracy. Control of power whether it is in the media, law, business happens through the subtle and not so subtle stacking of odds, tweaking of information, favouring of individuals. Not cartoon villains rubbing their hands at their nefarious plot. The main point about conspiracy is we are all at this game. Just some have more chips to protect than others</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this vaccine thing is such a big issue that it&#39;s mind-boggling, thanks for bringing attention to this subject.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching my posts (and the posts of others) get censored on reddit for years now, but <em>never</em> have I seen a stronger reaction than when I post links or comments that question, even <em>conservatively</em> question, the vaccine dogma.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the vaccination program is one of the single most important control mechanisms being forced upon the population today. As a result, anyone that begins to even question the safety and efficacy of the <em>numerous</em> and ever-increasing vaccines is immediately vilified and lumped in the same category as Holocaust deniers and the like.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason that the USA leads the Western world (by numerous times) in the amount of vaccines they give infants and children...and this number has exploded in the last 10 to 15 years.</p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance people experience when it comes to this subject is stunning. Even in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> there has been little room for those that question these programs of mass vaccination, I&#39;ve watched vaccination posts get buried again and again.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of individuals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products">were given contaminated hemophilia blood products </a> in the US and abroad. The kicker: Bayer and Baxter <em>knew</em> the product was contaminated, and they dumped it on the unsuspecting population, and untold thousands became infected with hepatitis C and HIV.</p>

<p>There are those that attribute this to neglect and corporate greed, but some have suggested that a fuckup on such a monumental scale has to at least have <em>some</em> sinister component.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Virus-Vaccine-Contaminated-Government/dp/0312342721/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1365969048&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+virus+and+the+vaccine">The history of the polio vaccine is one of the most terrifying things you will ever read.</a></p>

<p>The contents of that book, The Virus and the Vaccine, will blow away even the most hardened skeptic. For <em>decades</em> millions of people in the US and the rest of the world were given polio vaccines contaminated with numerous monkey viruses, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV-40">SV-40</a>.</p>

<p>This book tells the story of how this happened and how it was hushed up. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, the virtual <em>explosion</em> of soft tissue cancers in the last several decades can be directly linked to this contamination of SV-40 in the polio vaccine. This is literally one of the worst mistakes Western medicine has <em>ever</em> made, if not <em>the</em> worst, and the vast majority of people are completely ignorant about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18g99m/did_a_monkey_virus_contribute_to_emerging_global/">Here&#39;s a thread I made on the subject</a>.</p>

<p>For those that want a more broad overview of the history of the development of every vaccine used today, I highly recommend this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Concerned-Families-Practitioners-Edition/dp/188121737X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1365969075&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+parent+vaccine+safety">Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners</a>.</p>

<p>This book goes into detail about why the default position for vaccine apologists, namely &quot;herd immunity&quot;, is mostly a myth.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to stress that this isn&#39;t about <em>individual</em> vaccines being inherently harmful nor how the vaccine program is under the sole control of eugenicists. In a perfect world, vaccines <em>could</em> be safe and properly regulated and tested.</p>

<p>This is not a perfect world, and vaccines are <em>not</em> safe and properly regulated and tested. Corporate greed rules the day, and our children are being dosed with <em>way</em> too many vaccines with little or no research about the possible ramifications of combining numerous vaccines and administering them all in the same visit.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing attention to this subject, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <em>should</em> be a place where we can talk about stuff like this, no matter how controversial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally valid question. This was the rationale at the time...the long term effects of SV-40 were &quot;officially&quot; unknown at the time, although numerous scientists were trying desperately to sound the alarm. </p>

<p>They felt that it was better to stop the scourge that was polio than to risk jeopardizing the public&#39;s faith in the vaccine program with concerns that the polio vaccine might cause a cancer epidemic decades in the future. </p>

<p>The public&#39;s confidence had already been severely shaken in 1955 with the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_incident#The_Cutter_incident">Cutter incident</a>. Jonas Salk&#39;s experimental new &quot;inactivated&quot; polio vaccine was pushed on the market with little scrutiny and oversight, and as a result as many as 70,000 children were infected with polio, including several fatalities. Numerous scientists, including Dr. Bernice Eddy and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Stewart_%28cancer_researcher%29">Dr. Sarah Stewart</a>, tried to sound the alarm before it was released but they were ignored--so eager was the medical establishment to solve the polio problem once and for all. </p>

<p>After the Jonas Salk debacle, Albert Sabin&#39;s new &quot;live&quot; virus vaccine hit the market. <em>Both</em> Salk and Sabin&#39;s vaccines were heavily contaminated with the SV-40 virus, the direct result of using the kidneys of rhesus monkeys. Although Europe and Russia halted the production of Sabin&#39;s rhesus kidney polio vaccine by the 1970&#39;s, the US <em>continued</em> using this method until 2000!</p>

<p>This means that American children have been exposed to a cancer causing monkey virus for half a century. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40_Cancer_Foundation">The SV40 Cancer Foundation</a> was started by parents who lost their son to brain cancer that was proven, in a court of law, to have come from SV-40 contaminated polio vaccines.</p>

<p>So now to the essence of your question...did the polio vaccine <em>actually</em> eliminate polio in the US? </p>

<p>First of all, in case you don&#39;t know that much about polio, 95% of people exposed to the natural polio virus won&#39;t exhibit symptoms, even in an epidemic. Muscular paralysis occurs only in 1 in every 1,000 people. Everybody else is likely immune to the virus. </p>

<p>All in all, poor diet, poor hygiene, and poor education have <em>much</em> more to do with polio outbreaks than anything else. Eating too many sweets in the summer also increases the risk by many times. </p>

<p>Also, numerous studies have shown that injections actually <em>increase</em> susceptibility to polio. When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines became widespread in the 40&#39;s, paralytic polio skyrocketed. </p>

<p>To quote the Vaccine Safety Manual: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 1992 study, published in the <em>Journal of Infectious Diseases</em>, validated earlier findings. Children who received DPT injections were significantly more likely than controls to suffer paralytics poliomyelitis within the next 30 days. According to the authors, &quot;this study confirms that injections are an important cause of provocative poliomyelitis.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1995, the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> published a study showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were 8 times more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections. The risk jumped 27-fold when children received up to nine injections within one months after receiving the polio vaccine. And with ten or more injections, the likelihood of developing polio was 182 times greater than expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gets even more damning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When national immunization campaigns were initiated in the 1950s, the number of reported cases of polio following mass inoculations with the killed-virus vaccine was significantly greater than before mass inoculations, and may have more than doubled in the U.S. as a whole. For example, Vermont reported 15 cases of polio during the on-year report period ending August 30, 1954 (before mass inoculations), compared to 55 cases of polio during the one-year period ending August 30, 1955 (after mass inoculations)--a 266% increase. Rhode Island reported 22 cases during the before inoculations period as compared to 122 cases during the after inoculations period--a 454% increase. In New Hampshire the figures increased from 38 to 129; in Connecticut they rose from 144 to 276; and in Massachusetts they swelled from 273 to 2027--a whopping 642% increase.</p>

<p>In 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the &quot;principal if not sole cause&quot; of all reported polio cases in the US. since 1961.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, polio was already on the decline <em>before</em> the vaccine was introduced. In fact, from 1923 to 1953, before Salk&#39;s vaccine was introduced, the polio death rate in the U.S. and England declined <em>on its own</em> by 47% and 55% respectively. </p>

<p>Things got worse <em>after</em> the vaccine was introduced. In fact, numerous European countries questioned the polio vaccine and didn&#39;t mass inoculate...polio epidemics also ended in those countries. </p>

<p>Although many claim that polio was &quot;eliminated&quot; by the vaccine, there is actually <em>no</em> credible evidence that the polio vaccine caused the disease to disappear...<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Mendelsohn">Dr. Robert Mendelsohn</a> is one of many pediatricians who believed this passionately (he also opposed water fluoridation).</p>

<p>And here&#39;s a whole <em>new</em> can o&#39; worms...there may be a link to AIDS outbreaks in Africa and the polio vaccine! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Dr. Hilary Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo. 98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers. The youngest children received 15 times the adult dosage. Though Koprowski claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, WHO denied sanctioning the large-scale trials.</p>

<p>In 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin reported in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> that Koprowski&#39;s polio vaccine used in the African trials contained an &quot;unidentified&quot; cell-killing virus. It was never identified. However, in 1986 the earliest known blood cample containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville.</p>

<p>Koprowski&#39;s vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the AFrican trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi--the precise area where high levels of HIV infection were identified by researched 30 years later. Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people&#39;s mouths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are even links between the polio vaccine and Mad Cow disease.</p>

<p>I recently asked a pediatrician if there was one virus he would recommend that parents <em>not</em> give their children if the parent asked...he replied quickly and succinctly: the polio vaccine.</p>

<p>TLDR: the polio vaccine not only isn&#39;t safe, but it may be linked to global cancer epidemics and AIDS outbreaks, and it also may have made polio outbreaks <em>worse</em> than better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely respect where you are coming from.</p>

<p>But I do hope you realize that some of the very authors of the studies you cited that supposedly <em>disprove</em> the connection between SV-40 and human cancer are themselves among the primary proponents of the fact that SV-40 <em>does</em> cause cancer.</p>

<p>In particular, Michael Carbone is one of the leading researchers that has shown, <em>again and again</em>, that SV-40 is directly linked to soft-tissue cancer in humans! He was one of the authors in the very first study you cited.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to point out that you only linked to mesothelioma studies and epidemiological studies. The link between mesothelioma and SV-40 is just one issue of many when it comes to the simian virus and cancer. Exposure to SV-40 has been linked to <em>many</em> soft tissue cancers.</p>

<p>As for the epidemiological studies, a great deal of the world&#39;s leading polio researchers have concluded they are fundamentally flawed. Why?</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hypothesis that SV40 might cause cancer in humans has been a particularly controversial area of research. Several different methods have been used to detect SV40 in a variety of human cancers, although how reliable these detection methods are, and whether SV40 has any role in causing these tumors, remains unclear. As a result of these uncertainties, academic opinion remains divided, with some arguing that this hypothesis is not supported by the data, and others arguing that some cancers may involve SV40. However, the United States National Cancer Institute announced in 2004 that although SV40 does cause cancer in some animal models, &quot;substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who support the findings of the epidemiological studies are those who are toeing the line of the status quo...those who maintain complete faith in the Western medical system.</p>

<p>The most notable critics of these &quot;epidemiological&quot; studies are the scientists themselves...the ones who are repeatedly finding in their labs that SV-40 is extremely virulent and is showing up in many different types of cancers (in humans!).</p>

<p>While at first I was relieved to read about these epidemiological studies, what the Wikipedia article doesn&#39;t mention is that these studies have increasingly come under fire because they are literally based on guesswork, and poor guesswork at that.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is no way we can know exactly which batches of Salk and Sabin polio vaccines were contaminated, though undoubtedly many of them were.</p>

<p>Since there&#39;s no way to know which batches were contaminated, those carrying out the epidemiological studies had to literally guess which parts of the population received more of the contaminated lot.</p>

<p>Their methods have come under intense scrutiny and criticism...ultimately using epidemiological studies to &quot;prove&quot; SV-40 doesn&#39;t relate to increased cancer rates is a faulty premise at best and deliberate obfuscation at worst.</p>

<p>The issue is not as cut and dry as you claim. Even Wikipedia admits that the experts are heavily divided on this subject. To claim that there absolutely is <em>no connection whatsoever</em> between SV-40 and cancer in humans is disingenuous.</p>

<p>It is scientific <em>fact</em> that SV-40 causes cancer in animals. What is up for debate is how it affects humans.</p>

<p>If you truly desire to keep an open mind about this subject, do yourself a favor and get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Virus-Vaccine-Contaminated-Government/dp/0312342721/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1366002284&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+virus+and+the+vaccine">this book</a>. You can get it new for only 5 bucks: it&#39;s impeccably researched and sourced, and it goes into great detail about the true history of the polio vaccine, SV-40, and why the very epidemiological studies you cited are inherently flawed.</p>

<p>SV-40 <em>has</em> been definitively linked to <em>numerous</em> types of cancers. All of these studies are cited in great detail in the Virus and the Vaccine, if you truly are interested in learning more about this topic, do yourself a favor and get the book and give it due diligence.</p>

<p>Why the interest in blocking an expanded awareness of vaccine issues?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I&#39;m a medical student, and preventing the spread of devastating diseases is absolutely in my interest. If that makes me a &#39;shill&#39; because I&#39;m part of the medical industry or whatever, you can believe what you want, but I have no problem with blocking awareness of vaccine issues, and neither does the medical profession as a whole. What I <em>do</em> take issue with is spreading a wholly false rumor about an important vaccine, destabilizing confidence in one of the most important revolutions in modern medicine, leading to increased prevalence of conditions that could have been done away with long ago.</p>

<p>I linked to seven studies that all showed either no connection between cancers and SV-40, or demonstrated that earlier studies showing such a connection were methodologically flawed. You&#39;ve refuted none of them.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no conspiracy surrounding SV-40. Its presence in the polio vaccine has been noted and studied for decades. We know about it. It&#39;s taught to us in school. We don&#39;t trumpet it as a medical apocalypse to the news because all the work we&#39;ve done has shown nothing of note. It&#39;s a completely mundane issue.</p>

<p>If you and thebellmaster1x actually do some research on SV-40 you&#39;ll find that it remains <em>unknown</em> whether or not it causes cancer in humans. Some research shows it does, some research shows it doesn&#39;t (though these negative results may be inherently flawed as I explained above).</p>

<p>In other words, to say that the SV-40 contamination scandal is a &quot;completely mundane issue&quot; is simply not true. It was a serious cause for concern in the 1960&#39;s and it remains a cause for concern today, that is until definitive proof about its true toxicity is forthcoming.</p>

<p>The reason I keep &quot;pushing&quot; the book The Virus and the Vaccine is because you will find a comprehensive list of all of the studies, at the time of the book&#39;s publishing, that show a direct correlation between SV-40 and human tumors/cancer.</p>

<p>The book also goes into great detail about why the government&#39;s infamous epidemiological studies are inherently flawed.</p>

<p>I spent a good deal of time putting together these comments and sourcing them as best as I can. If you feel I&#39;ve lost credibility as a result, then either I haven&#39;t given this subject its due diligence, or you haven&#39;t given <em>my</em> comments and the links I provided due diligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both links you provided do not confirm or give strength to your entire claims against SV-40. All it did is give you language to make a suspicious set of statements.</p>

<p>So once again, where are the studies? These <em>hundreds</em> of studies you were so adamant about? If I follow through to the wikipedia page, am I just going to find more links to suggestive but not conclusive information?</p>

<p>It seems like you are basing everything you hold dear on just speculation. You haven&#39;t really got anything that says what you&#39;re implying.</p>

<p>Your posts are just verbose to distract. You seem to be confusing everything that you learned as fact to the horrors you concocted about SV-40 or heard about, which actual verified proof that it does anything you say it does.</p>

<p>correlation does not equal causation. Just because murders rise because ice cream sales drop, doesn&#39;t mean shit. ( Just random, make believe example of my point. )</p>

<p>BTW, it&#39;s clear that corporate greed in the medical area isn&#39;t restricted to vaccinations. Hitting them in the money pocket is necessary.</p>

<p>Just look at the Depuy hip replacement recall scandal.  They KNEW the hips were untested and caused heavy-metal poisoning (which causes immediate longterm damage, including cancer) but allowed them to be installed in thousands.  Hence why the most recent payout was over $8million in California.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In particular, the relative benefits of OPV to the U.S. population have diminished because of the elimination of wild-virus-associated poliomyelitis in the Western Hemisphere and the reduced threat of poliovirus importation into the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, that isn&#39;t the case in areas with very poor hygiene and sanitation.  There, the opposite is true, and so a different strategy is preferable.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.polioeradication.org/Research/Frequentlyaskedquestions.aspx:">http://www.polioeradication.org/Research/Frequentlyaskedquestions.aspx:</a></p>

<p>Unlike OPV, IPV confers very little immunity in the intestinal tract. When a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus or a cVDPV, virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the stool, risking continued circulation. For this reason, OPV is the vaccine of choice wherever a polio outbreak needs to be stopped.</p>

<p>There is still the risk of the vaccine mutating before immunity develops (as you pointed out), which is why the optimal strategy is to vaccinate everyone in the high-risk area as quickly as possible.</p>

I thought it may have been my friend fucking with me, since he&#39;s the one who pointed out the TIL to me... but I don&#39;t see how he could have obtained my password.  Do you also think I am CorruptEagle, or that it is just a coincidence?</p>

<p>As to why it was deleted… I think perhaps because it encouraged people to look into my history, which I actually kept very clean for when I cite it to the friends I tell about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  The whole thing was a laundry list of all my top submissions.  I am genuinely sad it&#39;s gone.</p>

<p>Also, one my posts in the vaccine thread was a video of Bill Gates saying his father was the &#39;head of Planned Parenthood&#39;.  Yet the Wikipedia article for his father doesn&#39;t even mention this.</p>

<p>Secondly, whilst I don&#39;t think your account should have been deleted, I must air my opinions on this matter. If parents do not vaccinate their kids, they are not fit to be parents. Every single person I know is vaccinated, and any of those who have autism, had it before they were vaccinated.</p>

    What proof have you that vaccinations are responsible for an apparent decrease in illness/disease?  Correlation is not causation. 
     Possibly more to the point, do you believe every statistic a &quot;government&quot; puts out?  Of course you don&#39;t.  So, pray tell, what has you so convinced, apparently, that ALL vaccinations (and, I suspect,all FDA approved drugs and so-called food) are &quot;good&quot; for humans?  </p>

R/conspiracy crowd jumps in head first, claims reddit is compromised. Rofl, this is amazing. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m about 99% sure op deleted his own post and account. No-one is scared of a random reddit post, op just deleted it because he was ashamed of the downvotes. &quot;The men&quot; deleting a reddit account to stop information dissemination about something YEARS old? Op, seriously, you want me to believe that???? Brute forced? You are amazing op. You deleted your own account, no-one cares about you that much to brute force you.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re referring to the Tuskagee experiment, they <em>already had</em> syphilis. They weren&#39;t told they had it and weren&#39;t treated for it. Still appallingly wrong, but not what you&#39;re claiming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Condé Nast Digital no longer runs reddit as a &quot;kinda profitable&quot; service. Advance Publications reorganized reddit.com into a service provided by Reddit, Inc. about a year ago.  Since then every popular or influential subreddit has had their moderation team infiltrated or completely replaced with &quot;professional&quot; moderators who have the mentality of a six year old when it comes to fairness and an understanding of authority.  They do whatever they want and literally respond with &quot;well, as long as we don&#39;t break Reddit, Inc&#39;s rules then we can literally do anything we want in our subreddits&quot;.  </p>

<p>They play dirty tricks.  They will collude to keep a post critical of them at 0 until it fails to exit the /new queue, and then they mock you for how poorly your submission did.  They derail and then threaten to ban you for derailing.  They use rationale not even supported by the stated rules of the subreddit to ban and remove content and when you point it out they just come up with a more vague and generic reason you were banned.  When you point out the impropriety of one moderator another pops up quickly to defend their friend&#39;s abuses.  When one moderator&#39;s moniker becomes too disliked they delete their account and continue moderating under another username.  </p>

<p>Reddit.com is not our reddit anymore.  It became profitable to Advance Publications and now it is <em>their</em> website.  We provide the content for free and receive no benefit from the profit generated.  Any attempt to draw attention to this mechanism is met with coordinated efforts to control and redirect the conversation to an echo-chamber (or &quot;circlejerk&quot;) where like-minded people can argue about minutiae instead of a diverse group of people discussing the totality of the issue.</p>

<p>They have killed the places where our communities overlap (*cough*<a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>*cough*) and have implemented rules to remove (take control) and redirect the conversations to subreddits where that sort of conversation would either be impossible, or would be so routine that nobody would care to participate. </p>

<p>Reddit is not &quot;democratic&quot; in any way other than the fact that we all vote for the status quo by continuing to participate here.  We all voted for this authoritarian environment with the only vote we have, our free will to walk away.  </p>

Propaganda and ego boosting for the masses who are bored at work or on a break between classes. Bill Gates is held in high regard here as an example of &quot;good without God&quot;. Bill Gates is not good. A site of brainwashed pop culture atheists may think he&#39;s great but that means nothing. It&#39;s an illusion. His legacy of benevolence is an illusion. History won&#39;t speak well of him or his family. He is one of the ultimate &quot;hidden in plain sight&quot; wicked personalities of our time. Most posters here are so wrapped up in the reddit antitheist mentality, totally suckered into the polarized &quot;science vs. spirituality&quot; nonsense, that giving examples or attempting to truly illuminate people here is pointless. Bill Gates is evil. Don&#39;t ask for sources. Go read and find out why. It&#39;s right in your face and beyond easy to see if you do a minimal amount of detective work.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some esoteric speculation, its fact.

    <div class="md"><p>So I was going to write about how he is filling a spot &quot;someone has to fill&quot;, and he&#39;s doing good things with his money.  But then while doing research I realized a couple things:  </p>

<p>A) Every guy that is that rich, gives away a lot of money.</p>

<p>B) <em>Most</em> decent human beings would be perfectly fine with giving away over half of their money during their lifetime, if they were worth 65Billion.</p>

<p>So I concede.  No one needs to be that rich, unless they&#39;ve earned in honestly...even then though.  That&#39;s a buttload, literally, of money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Gates Foundation openly acknowledges that there is a low risk (1 in 2.7 million) of paralisis, which, compared to the risk of actual polio, is arguably minimal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio">http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio</a></p>

<p>&quot;OPV, the polio vaccine used in most of the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But OPV consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases—1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine—can cause paralysis. In settings with very low OPV coverage, OPV vaccine viruses can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population, just like wild polioviruses.</p>

<p>We support the development of new OPV formulations that are not associated with the risk of mutation as well as vaccine alternatives to OPV. One of the most promising alternatives is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is routinely used in most developed countries but has not been broadly used elsewhere because of its higher cost and the need to have a trained provider administer it by injection. We support efforts to lower the cost of IPV and put in place the training, supply, delivery, and communications infrastructure to expand its use. We also support efforts to develop antiviral drugs to respond to a future accidental or intentional reintroduction of poliovirus in the post-eradication era.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s hardly conspiracy worthy material.</p>
