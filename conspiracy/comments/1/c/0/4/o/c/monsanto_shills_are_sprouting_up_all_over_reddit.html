    <div class="md"><p>A: I agree. However the strain of rat becomes a liability when combined with the rest of the research.</p>

<p>B: For each sex, one control group had access to plain water and standard diet from the closest isogenic non-transgenic maize control; six groups were fed with 11, 22 and 33% of GM NK603 maize either treated or not with R. The final three groups were fed with the control diet and had access to water supplemented with respectively.</p>

<p>Since it said earlier in the study that each group was 10 rats, that means in total the control : test ratio was 1:9, not nearly high enough.</p>

<p>Also, the OECD guildlines state that each group would need to have 50 rats in it, meaning for any meaningful statistics to be taken the study would have needed to study 1800 rats (100 rats per group, 50 as the control, 50 as the actual test)</p>

<p>C: The key word here is SOME.</p>

<p>Statistically tumours up to 81% are normal for such a strain of rat. (Done in 1972 the study, before all that nasty GM stuff). This issue is really caused by A.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/521452">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/521452</a></p>

<p>D: Yea but if you&#39;re trying to suggest something is wrong, you need to give a damned good reason when only 2/9 of your tests show a positive result that&#39;s statistically significant, and 1/9 of your groups actually has a higher survival rate. (With the rest being near equal considering the low group numbers.)</p>

<p>E: To be fair, I can&#39;t confirm or deny this. It just seemed like any ethical committee worth their salt wouldn&#39;t have  let the rats suffer long enough to be able to take those pictures.</p>

<p>If the rat species were ok for Hammonds 2004 study, they are ok for this study.
Take it up with US National Toxicology Program guidelines for carcinogens studies. Don&#39;t blame the rats we been successfully using for other cancer studies since the 1980s. </p>

<p>50-70% prematurely died before any control rat. The first GMO/RR caused deaths were almost a solid year before any control group started dying. If your suggesting RR+GMO increases lifespan, I challenge you to consume some glyphosate (RR) daily.</p>

<p>All treatments in both sexes enhanced large tumor incidence by 2–3-fold in comparison to our controls (total number of small expected tumors). Roundup/glyphosate has been shown to disrupt aromatase which synthesizes estrogens, but to also interfere with estrogen and androgen receptors in cells. 
androgen is responsible for male sexual characterics, responsible for differentiation (of male against female) of penis, scrotum and prostate, i.e. deforming male genetials. Females weren&#39;t as lucky, they just died.</p>

<p>Shall we really talk about confirmed effects of glyphosate to humans, human reproduction / deformations,  and wildlife as well? </p>

<p>Are you saying the smaller control group influenced the cancer and mortality rate of the experimental group? So the same experimental group size as the pro-gmo Hammond 2004 study, and everything is ok. But then we its done by 3rd party its not ok. Hypocrite much?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>B: Source? Because every other scientific experiment I&#39;ve seen has the control and the testing groups near the same size, either that or the error possibility becomes too high. (Although I like the lack of error margin in the paper.)</p>

<p>College Statistics. Best I can do, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=probit+of+statistics%2C+sample+and+control+size">http://lmgtfy.com/12p938qisudh198321</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>C: The stats say nothing of the sort. Looking at the stats, only five of the groups. had these sorts of numbers, mostly due to the female control having an unnaturally high survival rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with most mammals, the female usually outlives the males. Its not unnatural. Its simple see, these rats would have lived longer if it wasn&#39;t for GMO and or RR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C (continued)Also, you failed to respond to the fact that the average &#39;Don&#39;t touch&#39; tumour rate in these animals are defined as 74% for males, and 81% for females over two years. Some people might question how amazingly both controls managed to beat the odds, but I&#39;ll give the benefit of the doubt and suggest it&#39;s just due to the low control numbers. Sadly until you respond to this fact as described in the study I linked, this line of discussion will not continue, as I will not argue with someone who refuses to respond to facts given</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they do have higher rates of tumors. Lets compare the typical (control) tumors found in these rats and compare to what GMO and RR did. This is why these rats are used for carcinogenic studies, to reveal anything that exacerbates the tumors and cancer. If it was safe, there would be no influence on the average cancer cell development. </p>

<p>D: Again the stats say otherwise. Also the studies you are refering to were done on cell cultures. Practically everything effects cell cultures. Heck it&#39;s well known you can do a lot of damage to cell cultures with harmless materials like water.</p>

<p>F) was a statement, I see no question. calm down tho, you skipped E.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And B: If I go and make a study where I bang little kids to &#39;cure cancer&#39;, people do not need to replicate my study to show that it;&#39;s wrong. Same concept. All you need is a basic understanding in statistics to know where it&#39;s wrong (As infact a mathematics Professor were one of the studies critics.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Irrelevant &#39;study&#39;. Its how we come to prove opinions turned into hypothesis are right, repeatable experiments. If your willing to throw away repeating experiments and instead go along with people&#39;s opinion, you don&#39;t belong in scientific discussion. </p>

<p>Either way, I look forward to better testing with animals that live long enough so the ravages of GMO+RR become obviously apparent. Sleep tight, harbinger of death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A: No, I&#39;m saying the small groups sizes effected the survival rates of the control, giving, through random chance giving them far higher survival rates than the previously accepted tested values of 74 and 81% respectively. This is not a hard concept to understand.</p>

<p>B: Ha ha you little bitch, go back to touching little kid whore. Considering every source I&#39;ve seen on the subject and the equations I&#39;ve seen suggest at the VERY LEAST a 25% control ratio is needed to have any meaningful value of P, so until you can offer something to this discussion, I and everyone reading this considers this point one nill to me, against the forces of kiddie fiddling whores.</p>

<p>C: Yes, if we compare the overall results of the study (50-80% cancer) to the well tested well researched control (Of 80%) It suggests that GMO&#39;s had no effect, and the main cause of cancer was rather simply the rats breeding to do so. Now if you&#39;re talking about the pitiful control from the test in question, you have to ask: Why did these 20 rats have such a higher survival rate than the ones in the 1974 study?</p>

<p>Also your pictures mean fuck all, since knowing the test it was more than likely not a blind selection, but the healthiest control compared with the sickest test.</p>

<p>F: And it has nothing to do with opinion, but basic scientific protocol  leading to the entire scientific world denouncing this test. </p>

<p>And I too hope that the kids you rape while wearing a Hitler costume live long enough to see you die when you choke on your ladyboys mums dick you sadistic whore fucker bitch cunt dick whore bitch whore fucker pedo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea... I&#39;m really really upset about the behaviour that happened. It is really unprofessional and wrong, and I hope such actions will never happen again. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sowwy that bad things happen, and I hope that I in the upcoming days I can find the personal strength and resolve to hug and kiss your boo boo better. I also pwomise to be there with a cup of warm milk and a bed time stowy to make sure there are no monsters under the bed.</p>

<p>I really hope in the future the atrocities that happened here never appear again, where you repeatedly fuck your mum every night while your dad watches and wanks off in a Hitler costume. Mostly because it&#39;s really fucking weird and probably against some laws, especially when your daughter (or whoever that hot chick is) gets involved. Partly because the &#39;throwing up in my mouth&#39; sensation I get every time I see your name is super awkward.</p>

<p>Also due to the fact that I&#39;ve been shown my place by the 1984 censorship power of an internet mod, in-between your IQ of 42 and various shifts at Mcdonalds, I don&#39;t think I can handle the grief. The fact that I&#39;m unable to grasp the concepts of taking the 0.0001 seconds to make a new account for a completely free no email needed website, or even using one of the thousands of proxies that exist, means that I feel I may eventually take my own life due to this crippling feeling of only having my IQ of 137, and my degree, to comfort me on those long nights without the subreddit of morons.</p>

<p>I really hope this bad blood between us can be resolved, partly because I&#39;d love to get involve in a threesome with your mum and the hot chick, but mostly because I believe our friendship can never be broken and is the most important thing in the world.</p>

<p>Sincerely, hugs kisses and a smile, your best friend, Bainshie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>let us recognize that adverse name calling shows at least:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A lack of vocabulary and ability to communicate, sometimes triggered by frustration;</p></li>
<li><p>Verbal Abuse and Bullying in belittling the target of the name calling;</p></li>
<li><p>Direct reference to and denigration of people with IQ scores of lower than 90 to 110 (&quot;average), taken from an expired psychological system of classifying IQs that was once used on a daily basis; and</p></li>
<li><p>Adverse Labeling.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Further, name calling is not classy behavior and the truth of this phenomenon is seen in muckraking proliferating political campaigns, perhaps more so than ever previously in the lead-up to the 2012 General Elections; in religious arguments; and in intellectual/educational discussions gone awry. Perhaps you have seen it in other discussions. Notice that by the rules of real debate, name calling is disallowed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about however. There is an entire other class of internet users whose sole purpose is to spread disinfo, counteract certain opinions from becoming popular, and raise doubt in people&#39;s minds. </p>

<p>One example (of many!) is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">Water Army</a>. That&#39;s just one. Think of what resources might exist for a multi-billion dollar company (like Monsanto, or a drug company, or even something as innocuous as an athletic shoe company).

<p>The problem we have here is that crazy people have twisted the word &quot;shill&quot; to mean &quot;I don&#39;t need to explain why I hate <em>x subject</em> to you because you&#39;re obviously in the employ of <em>x subject</em>&quot;  Sadly in a lot of cases &quot;x Subject&quot; is, of course, Jews/Zionists as it&#39;s part of the arsenal of tricks the white supremacist crowd indoctrinate their followers with.</p>

<p>So when it&#39;s used in any other context you immediately assume that the person making the claim is the sort of person who denies the holocaust and thinks Rabbi&#39;s feed on gentile babies, and therefore pretty much everything else they are saying <em>must</em> be insane as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not insane to assume companies spend money to suppress negative publicity though, but throwing the term &quot;shill&quot; around is framing the argument as one between crazy paranoid people and people who just don&#39;t think GM food is the antichrist.</p>

I have tried to make this point on here before, but no one seems to care. In order to get through to people, you have to treat them like people.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, we can&#39;t forget about HBGary - that&#39;s one example of &quot;shills&quot; that made mainstream-accepted media. There are other small-time examples too. I just found <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/12/how-forensic-linguistics-identified-online-trolls-in-new-orleans.html">this one</a> for example.

<p>I think it serves to validate the point that a company of Monsanto&#39;s size is more than able to organize and pay for numerous &quot;influencers&quot; on Reddit and of course on other sites. And consider what else they could buy with their money: everything from favorable articles (not just comments on articles) to actual research papers.

Most of the GMOs used today are new and the studies are minimal, most if not all are biased because they are funded by the same companies themselves, and there actually have been studies on mice in which a certain GMO affects them generations later. There need to be further studies before we all start eating &quot;technology&quot; (I disagree with you on the term, because technology being used to pervert your food does not make that food technology, but I digress), and people that proclaim to love science like you are strangely against (gasp!) rational, precautionary steps (the Scientary fucking Method!) being taken before this stuff is forced down our throats. </p>

If you wanted to do that, you&#39;d make the public attend scientific seminars and other information sharing processes. All you do with the labelling is set up a bureaucratic process by which you can fuck over companies you don&#39;t like (I think there are a lot of exemptions for the GMO/non-GMO labelling, right? I can&#39;t remember exactly, but someone else mentioned it somewhere..) because the public automatically assumes that GMO is death and non-GMO is amazing. </p>

<p>Seriously, it&#39;s kind of like natural vs artificial additions to ingredients. Do people even realize that the only difference is the process in which you get those additions?

In certain circles GMOs are seen as practically terroristic, but for every friend I have that thinks so, I have just as many friends who are pro-GMO, and the rest I can&#39;t imagine caring. Maybe there&#39;s a pretty good deal of psychology involved that as long as the general consensus is negative the people in the &quot;middle group&quot; might sway away from GMOs, but I&#39;m inclined to think that GMOs are going to be profitable to see regardless of whether or not they&#39;re labeled.

<p>I&#39;m an ordinary high schooler. And because you&#39;re such a paranoid piece of shit, nothing I say will fucking prove it to you.</p>

<p>What do you need from me to prove anything? A picture? </p>

<p>If I give you a picture, you&#39;ll probably dig your heels in even deeper and cry that I got some random high schooler for the picture. If I take a picture of my school ID, you&#39;ll say it&#39;s fake.</p>

<p>What do you need from me to prove that I&#39;m not a shill?</p>

<p>Nothing. You&#39;ve already made up your mind that Monsanto is big and evil and jumped through the hoops of maintaining three different Reddit accounts with unique interests and prose styles just for some puny PR. </p>

<p>Adding more shit to your crazy hypothesis <em>ad hoc</em> wouldn&#39;t make a god damned difference, because you&#39;re too short sighted to even consider evidence that contradicts your beliefs. </p>

I support at the LEAST labeling GMO&#39;s in our foods and at the most holding Monsanto monetarily accountable for the destruction of pure strains of food and exposing us all the the ramifications.

<p>Monsanto Protection Act</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually read that law and was the person who posted the details of it in the first <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> post.</p>

<p>I have the same conclusion that I do then; I don&#39;t see what the fuss is about.  </p>

<p>I actually made the effort to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1b6zda/im_really_surprised_this_has_yet_to_be_mentioned">find what you wrote over there</a>.  You posted an article which was downvoted because it was stupid and sensationalistic.  The comments focus on the content of the article including things like people are trying to &quot;poison our food&quot; and &quot;the Government is <em>waging war</em> against the people&quot; and the like of.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also another comment that directly quote the actual law and asks you what exactly is wrong with it.  Then you declare that Natural News is the &quot;real news&quot; and tell everybody to &quot;go back to sleep&quot; because they quoted <strong>the actual law</strong> at you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the exact type of person who gives skeptics a bad name.  You quoted a source that doesn&#39;t even claim to be unbiased then when people quoted legislation to you, you went down the &quot;wake up sheeple&quot; line.  </p>

<p>More to the point, the fact that you have +19 on this subreddit without anybody else thinking to check up on your claims says an awful lot too</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy board amigo... the government &quot;poisoning our food&quot; and &quot;waging war against us&quot; have been topics discussed by conspirators for YEARS.</p>

<p>Why the hell would you have a problem with someone suggesting these notions? The whole point of this place is for discussing ideas with open-minded folks, especially ideas that lack proper support/evidence so we can all try to gain a broader understanding or learn something new.

<p>Err...you specifically referenced a post you&#39;d made and made a point relevant to that post.  To judge your comment on its merits, I had to look at what you were referring to.  I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re so enraged by this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And any source that says these things without very strong evidence should also be dismissed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>especially ideas that lack proper support/evidence so we can all try to gain a broader understanding or learn something new</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideas that lack support, yes.  Not ideas that lack evidence.  And I certainly don&#39;t believe things that aren&#39;t supported by evidence, I weigh up the evidence of both sides and come to a temporary conclusion until something better comes along.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between a conspiracy (that is, ideas that lack support or are censored) to a fantasy (ideas that lack any real evidence).  It&#39;s an important distinction to make and one that you should be making yourself lest you fall into the whacko category.</p>

<p>Whole reply added though only the second paragraph catches my attention. It shows that this subreddit has many enemies. I&#39;m not a advocate of &quot;raid&quot; style posting but clearly, they are.</p>

<p>It also confirms that these posters have a clear anti r/conspiracy bias. </p>

<p>Many university research grants are funded by corporations looking for specific results. </p>

<p><a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2007/oct/sciences-worst-enemy-private-funding#.UWSPD9eh4Yw">... former FDA commissioner Jane Henney remarked that “it’s getting much more difficult to get that pure person with no conflicts at all. . . . The question becomes both one of disclosure and how much of a conflict you can have and still be seen as an objective and knowledgeable reviewer of information.” More than half the scientists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who responded to a survey conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2005 agreed that “commercial interests have inappropriately induced the reversal or withdrawal of scientific conclusions or decisions through political intervention.” Merrill Goozner argues that the danger runs deeper. “In many precincts of the scientific enterprise, the needs of industry have become paramount,” he says, turning science into “a contested terrain” where facts are increasingly contingent on who is funding the research. &quot;The whole scientific revolution, which was a product of the Enlightenment, is threatened when you commercialize science,” he warns.</a></p>

<p>Well ... you can&#39;t really. Not without checking things out yourself. But then I think there are a lot of PR &amp; marketing concerns, and organizations tasked with spreading disinformation or propaganda who are quite happy with that arrangement.   </p>

<p>So who is left to look out for the public&#39;s interest?  Virtually no one. The corporate media or anyone on their payroll isn&#39;t going to go against those interests - anyone stepping out of those editorial boundaries gets themselves sacked.  There&#39;s a handful but no where close to being enough independent investigative journalists left to run down even all the major corruption and conflict of interest stories. The US regulatory bodies are all getting staffed &amp; chaired by former executives of the industries those bodies are supposed to regulate - huge conflicts of interest but no one pays that any attention. </p>

<p>The capper for me was when I heard Dubya admit on camera that the senior drug prescription bill was completely written by the drug companies themselves.  No one in the media commented on the obvious conflict of interest in that AT ALL. </p>

<p>Everything about American life from news to politics to business to research to consumer products has become caveat emptor.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqA16u-qf58">Nothing is what it seems.</a> </p>

<p>edit;  sp + btw, I don&#39;t know anything either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I trust consensus over individual reporting. I will give a position the benefit of the doubt and compare that position or idea to other ideas I can find. That&#39;s why I&#39;m subscribed to this subreddit and places like <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> as well as <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a>. I don&#39;t treat any source as inherently true or inherently false. I take each issue on its merits and examine the facts presented by all sides of the argument. Some sides however carry more weight than others. For instance I trust the American Pediatrics Association more than i trust Jenny McCarthy. I make those judgement&#39;s as the issues arise. I don&#39;t however doubt the validity of a source just because it doesn&#39;t agree with my own personal opinions, because the source i trust the least is me. I am too flawed, too average in my intelligence, too unschooled in science and technology to ever assume that something I think is true simply because it makes sense to me.

    <div class="md"><p>oh come on. cars were unsafe because they lacked basic safety we take for granted today (seatbelts, etc). small doses of radiation were used to treat minor illnesses, leading to deformations. cigarettes used to be ok for pregnant women to smoke. and yes, a sedentary lifestyle is now seen as detrimental to ones health. your strawman argument fails here because no one studies things that directly affect health until the effects have done their damage, while you talk about fear of technology. food isnt technology, it directly affects us and the pro GMO idiots&#39; best defense is that there is no evidence either way. (by the way cars are still dangerous, only less so)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you insinuate I don&#39;t believe in facts.</p>

<p>Is everything black &amp; white? Do you trust everyone and everything - every corporation and everything the government says as reliable fact? I would hope you&#39;re not that gullible. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are sources you can trust.  But how do you vet them?</p>

<p>Who do <em>you</em> personally trust?   </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about being paranoid. It&#39;s about dealing with the reality that everyone has an agenda and that for only a certain percentage, that agenda happens to be the truth and real science.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>:) Thanks, I do like to have reasonable discussions online, but I&#39;m probably one of those people where anonymity brings out the impatient side of me (probably because face contact makes things more personal whereas lack of face contact lets me dehumanize the opposition in my head). You&#39;re right about the different circles, but I think my circles aren&#39;t representative of the general &quot;middle group&quot; because of where I am and what I do. </p>

<p>I think what you&#39;re describing sounds like how people conform to ideas without having to think through it. There was an interesting simulation done on this by Josh Epstein, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0CDYQFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.27.1338%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;amp;ei=J6oBUvmuGoq0igLO-oDQDQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFIQ9T7_W9w02dvqQN6bubktOE0ZA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.50310824,d.cGE&amp;amp;cad=rja">&quot;LEARNING TO BE THOUGHTLESS:
SOCIAL NORMS AND INDIVIDUAL COMPUTATION&quot;</a> (links to a PDF) if you want to see. Well, in any case, I don&#39;t feel too strongly about this in either case, but I just like to push against whichever side feels more strongly about things in general. :D</p>
