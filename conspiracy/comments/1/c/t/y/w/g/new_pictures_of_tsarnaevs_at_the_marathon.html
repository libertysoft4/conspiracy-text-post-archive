<p><em>&quot;It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,&quot; Patrick said on “Meet the Press.” &quot;It&#39;s pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>He has yet to see the videos for himself, but this sheds light on what we should expect to see whenever footage is made available to the public. Nobody can yet say for sure when that will be but it should be clearer after the suspect is formally charged, which NBC reports will be Monday at the earliest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Deval Patrick&#39;s statement is implying that Dzhokhar took a few seconds to clue into what was in his backpack. Which of course means that he had no idea what was in the backpack. Ie: this is more evidence of at east Dzhokhar being a patsy. </p>

<p>Did his older brother, Tamerlan even know? If his brother knew, then he would have informed his younger brother, and therefore, Dzhokhar would have moved away IMMEDIATELY after placing the backpack down.</p>

<p>I think this leads to the conclusion that #1 they were both patsys and knew nothing about their true role that day and also #2 that Tamerlan might have known more than his younger brother, and therefore, this is why we have Tamerlan being arrested nude, and relatively unscathed, and then, after in custody, they beat the crap out of him, shoot him, and remove the main link in the truth chain. </p>

<p>Dzhokhar knows fuck all, and they want to keep it that way. If you havent seen it, there is a hospital photo of Dzhokhar with ear plugs in his ears! Don&#39;t let him hear tidbits of facts from agents in room!</p>

<p>Anyone agree disagree with my reasoning? We are all speculating here, so please, poke holes, offer up counter reasoning.</p>

<p>Do you really think they would put earplugs in someone&#39;s ear so they can&#39;t hear secrets? Wouldn&#39;t it make <strong>so much more sense</strong> to just, I don&#39;t know, leave the room?</p>

<p>Those earplugs are probably to help his ears recover from possible damage. I can imagine that your ears are ringing after a couple of flashbangs were thrown your way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bring it back to common sense... In case something slips out in conversation, that they do not want the suspect to hear, they would indeed take this precaution of putting earplugs in his ear.  We are talking about the CIA, FBI, ATF, etc here.. they are going to cover their bases... you really think they are going to take a chance on this issue and possibly jeopardize a trail, or accidently let him hear something?? cmon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure the CIA or FBI won&#39;t hire you if you tend to let something slip during a conversation. Blabbering about important information while the suspect is in the room would be the most unprofessional thing ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you dont take chances. These are indeed professionals in the sense that they probably would not let important information slip... but again, if you are the CIA.. FBI... you cover all your bases, since it is not only your men in the room.. you also have doctors.. nurses... police...etc... look at what has leaked out so far... the Tamerlan death photo... The Jahar hospital photo...</p>

<p>Again, we are talking about basic protocol... you dont say &quot;oh, we are CIA, nothing will slip off our tongues&quot;... but what you do do, is have a policy in place, to put ear plugs on <em>enemy combatants</em>. plain and simple. not sure why its so hard to understand such a basic method of protocol.</p>

<p>The CIA, FBI dont operate on maybes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. In this case, where you have such a HIGH PROFILE ENEMY COMBATANT, whose room is frequented by NON-FBI, NON-CIA personal, then yes, im sure whoever is in charge ordered that.</p>

<p>He WAS NOT moved to a secure area. He is in a public hospital. </p>

<p>Jahar is a patsy and they obviously want to keep it that way and not do him any favors and let him overhear anything if something is mentioned in his hospital room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i&#39;m saying if the FBI agents need to talk about something the suspect should not hear, I would think standard protocol is to leave the room, not just put earplugs in. Most plugs like that don&#39;t even stop sound all together, they are used to stop damaging sound from large machines and the like, not to block sound all together. The FBI agents would move to a secured room to talk. Why would they talk about pertinent info within earshot of the suspect. That sounds absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, if you are the the FBI, you take no chances. At this point in time, you have a leaked photo of Jahar in his hospital bed and a death photo of Tamerlan. They know leaks happen and even professionals slip up on purpose or accidentally.</p>

<p>And, again, you have doctors and nurses going in and out of there as well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why this is so hard to understand about the ear plugs. This guy is an enemy combatant. They are not going to do him any possible favors and would like to keep him in a position where the information he gets is totally controlled by them.</p>

<p>And again, he is NOT in a secure location. He is not in a holding cell and in an isolated environment. The FBI and CIA are going to want to simulate that as best they can by blocking out his hearing.</p>

<p>I dont see why its hard to understand that they would want to CONTROL this enemy combatant by blocking out his hearing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say you take no chances. Wouldn&#39;t that include not talking in the same fucking room as the suspect. Ear plugs are not perfect, so talking in the same room as him is taking a chance of leaking info. How is that hard to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isnt about playing musical chairs and having the FBI move in and out of the room for every conversation of a sensitive nature.</p>

<p>Sure, earplugs are not perfect, but they would definitely obstruct his hearing quite a bit.  But again, this is about controlling an enemy combatant. Not about how or when the FBI talks about things of a sensitive nature.</p>

<p>I do have good reading comprehension, but again, Jahar is in a hospital. There is more than just FBI there. You got nurses, police, doctors, etc. I didnt state Jahar would move to another room, you are jumping the gun yourself in terms of what you are reading. Reread please.</p>

<p>And yes, again, i will restate, that they take no chances. And once again, I will state to you, that this is not just about the FBI and their conversations. This is also about what the nurses, doctors and police say in that room. How is that not clear?</p>

<p>I was just stating the fact that he is not in a secure location. This fact needs to be said, because it provides context to the situation at hand.</p>

<p>I am bringing UP the fact that there is more than just highly trained FBI agents in the room, such as nurses, doctors and police, because THEY might let information slip.</p>

<p>ALSO, the FBI is definitely going to want to control all conversations in the first place. Various interrogations will take place right?  But, if your the FBI, you do not want any conversations taking place off the record and Jahar engaging in banter with nurses, doctors or police, HENCE another reason for earplugs...</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t see whats the big problem in pointing out that the FBI would want to control as much as possible what happens in that room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, how about what his friends are saying? Saying that he is innocent? How about what his family and relatives are saying (sans uncle aslan) -- that he is innocent. How about a nurse who sympathizes with him, and lets him know all this? </p>

<p>Further more... how about Jahar asking how his brother died? Does Jahar know that they are trying to pin his death on him? That they are going with the story that Jahar ran over his brother and killed him?</p>

<p>Like, the possibilities are endless.. I again dont see whats the logical problem with CONTROLLING YOUR PRISONER. That is all I am talking about here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, Jahar said he didnt do it. But again, you want to control the information he gets. Why is this hard to comprehend? </p>

<p>Why give Jahar hope and encouragement from a nurse who says his friends are cheering him on, saying he is innocent? You might as well allow Jahar to have a fucking laptop with wifi in the room...</p>

<p>There was some law enforcement alluding to teh fact that he may face charges for his bros death as well... </p>

<p>If he cant talk today... maybe in a few days... who knows? Not really important...</p>

<p>The main issue here is information control. Prisoner Control. Securing the prisoner. However you want to put it. But, again, you have to put Information Control AND Unsecure Hospital Location together. </p>

<p>INFORMATION CONTROL - UNSECURE HOSPITAL LOCATION.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you&#39;re stretching if you think Deval Patrick was implying some sort of unknown involvement on Dzhokhar&#39;s behalf.</p>

<p>That line of thinking may be reaction some will have when viewing the evidence on their own when it&#39;s made available, that&#39;s something for those individuals to broach for discussion at that time. I don&#39;t feel the Governor was alluding to any such activity, nor do I think it would make sense for him to within context of the current public information available (he would be instantly tagged as a conpiracy theorist and eaten alive by the media/public).</p>

<p>It does appear that the direction the information is leading is Tamerlan will appear to have more involvement/knowledge than Dzhokhar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think this leads to the conclusion that #1 they were both patsys and knew nothing about their true role that day and also #2 that Tamerlan might have known more than his younger brother, and therefore, this is why we have Tamerlan being arrested nude, and relatively unscathed, and then, after in custody, they beat the crap out of him, shoot him, and remove the main link in the truth chain.</p>

<p>Atta was a confirmed cokehead. He frequented hookers. His girlfriend was also a hooker. He had tons of money all the time. Is this the picture of an Islamic Radical Ideologue? Or of a patsy enjoying living like a rock star? You be the judge. </p>

<p>Again, they were all lied to.

Maybe they were ordered to and observed doing those drops in the prior weeks and made sure they always followed instructions not to look in the bags...</p>

I would guess there is forensic evidence from ballistics to fingerprints matching the gun up to one of them from the MIT shooting. Tamerlan had a suicide vest strapped to him when he advanced on the police. Pretty clear it was him, otherwise someone else would have been shot dead by the cops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you have no evidence at all that the FBI is helping people like the Boston Bombers. You have evidence that they successfully infiltrate terrorist cells by going undercover.
Just to get this straight: you produce evidence that an organization that is charged with infiltrating terrorist networks actually infiltrates terrorist networks.
In other conspiracy news: water is wet.
You making the claim that they are aiding terrorists. Infiltrating they and then arresting them is not siding terrorism in any universe.

<p>dude, come on. You&#39;re just arguing for the sake of it. Everybody that ever watched a movie, read a book, turned on a TV knows that if you&#39;re going to commit a crime you need to hide your identity a.k.a your face. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think your problem may be that you think movies and TV are apparently reality.  I mean, what exactly do you expect them to do -- wear a hoodie and sunglasses, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2MVaZ9u.png">like this</a>?  I would call the Dumbest Plan Ever.</p>

<p>These guys were probably assuming that if they dressed normal and made no attempt to stand out, they wouldn&#39;t draw attention or arouse suspicion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yeah maybe because he&#39;s hiding behind sunglasses and a [forward facing] hat in clothes that don&#39;t stand out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually meant his demeanor, the expression on his face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find it odd that after they committed this terrible shit they didn&#39;t even leave the area. they didn&#39;t even seem to have a escape plan at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their escape plan was Not Getting Caught.  They mistakenly assumed that if they went about their normal lives after the bombing they wouldn&#39;t arouse any suspicion.  It was only after their names and pictures were spread all over the news that they had to formulate an escape plan, which is why they robbed the convenience store -- clearly a hasty plan for escape.</p>

<p>I think where they messed up was in vastly underestimating the FBI&#39;s ability to recruit ordinary citizens in turning over photographs -- and that&#39;s not that surprising, since this is the first time that its really been done.  This is the first major public bombing since the advent of the smartphone, and they likely forgot to factor in that the entire area would be being constantly photographed by a thousand handheld, web-enabled cameras.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure bombers in the future will study this case and learn lessons from it, but I&#39;m guessing that the elder Tzarenov hadn&#39;t accounted for the ability of thousands of people to instantly email all the photos they took of the event to the FBI, nor did they account for the FBI&#39;s ability to rapidly sort through the photos and identify them.</p>

<p>Also, the elder brother clearly made a mistake in recruiting his younger brother.  I suspect that he was so wrapped up in his own alienation that he didn&#39;t think about the vast social network his brother was enmeshed in -- the FBI&#39;s facial recognition software was apparently useless, and the pair was identified by the numerous people who recognized the younger brother.  Had he acted alone and only set off one bomb, the hunt for the Boston Bomber might still be ongoing.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that.  Don&#39;t put dumb arguments in my mouth just because your argument is dumb.</p>

<p>Also, I not saying the brothers weren&#39;t at fault. Jhar or whatever was obviously a patsy and probably his older brother aswell. The Craft group is responsible. That picture of dude running away without a backpack is proof and please don&#39;t use that picture of him after with a backpack as your excuse.</p>

<p>So the plan was to have a bunch of guys wearing the uniforms of their company plant bombs in front of a giant crowd full of people taking photos.  </p>

I was under the impression that the suspects turned left onto Boyleston (heading the same direction as the runners), made the first drop in front of the Forum, continued in same direction toward finish line, made the drop there, detonated bombs near finish line and then exited the area in same direction they were previously heading. Is this correct? If not, where am I going wrong. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it has been determined... Their statements sure make it seem like they got everything on one camera or another, before, during, and after the bombings. But I&#39;m not sure I know for certain which order everything was in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply.  I was confused. I thought I heard somewhere that they were spotted at the finish line when the bombs were detonated. And according to the FBI film, they were heading the same direction as the race was heading with both packs on. That being the case, I assumed they made the first drop at the forum and the second drop at the finish line. Now I see this picture of the white hat suspect exiting the scene from the Forum area and not the finish line area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think they have only released the clearest images to identify both suspects in, when they were walking together. I think that we (the public) are still missing a large chunk of their movements on film. I do seem to recall some law enforcement official saying that the second bomb was still in Dzhokhar&#39;s possesion when the first went off... then he dropped it and moved away quickly and it exploded soon after. So I think they split up to make the drops, and at least one of them fled back the way they came from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. That&#39;s exactly the conclusion I just came up with while looking through  all the pics on this site.  I&#39;m pretty sure they both turned left onto Boylston St. heading in the same direction as the runners were heading. They both continued past the Forum toward the finish line. They stopped somewhere between the Forum and finish line. Split up.. black hat guy heads toward finish line to make the drop while the white hat guy goes back towards the forum to make his drop. Then each departed the scene in the same direction they were previously heading. Sounds as if the white hat guy heard the explosion at the finish line and probably knew he had ten seconds to drop his bag and get out of the area. </p>

<p>where are Dzhokar&#39;s legs in this pic?

<p>Maybe I am just not seeing something, but it looks as if he has no legs.</p>

<p>When I look where his legs should be, I see the green chair, and then seemingly nothing but sidewalk until there appears to be someone else&#39;s foot behind him.  Nothing but air.</p>

<p>Am I wrong? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone give me a quick rundown of the sequence the drops were made? I was under the impression that they headed in the same direction the runners were heading.  That they placed the first bag in front of the forum, continued down boyleston (same direction as the runners) towards finish line, made the drop nearest to finish line, after detonating, continued in same direction as they were previously heading. So, the first drop was actually the second to be detonated. Is this all correct?</p>

The public safety exception is triggered when police officers have an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from immediate danger.</p></li>

<li><p>Jahar Wears a backwards white hat (w/ identifiable number) and no sunglasses. Unlike his older brother, Dzhokhar made little effort to prevent cameras from capturing his face, making him easier to identify when the FBI released security camera photos on Thursday. Indeed, classmates at University of Massachusetts–Dartmouth did see him in the photos, but dismissed the similarity because it seemed so far-fetched.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave the car in the shop. The Wall Street Journal reported that Dzhokhar stopped by an auto-body shop in Watertown on Tuesday to pick up the Mercedes he&#39;d brought in for repairs.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay in Boston. The second bomb exploded at 2:49 p.m. last Monday. Dzhokhar and Tamerlan carjacked a Mercedes at 10:39 p.m.* on Thursday. What did they do in the interim three days? Go to the gym, check in on their busted car, and, in Dzhokhar&#39;s case, go to a party on the UMass–Dartmouth campus. During the three-day window in which their involvement was unknown, they made no attempt to flee.</p></li>
<li><p>Kill an MIT police officer. Why did the brothers shoot 26-year-old Sean Collier? The murder at 10:30 p.m. on Thursday set in motion the events that would ultimately lead to their capture.</p></li>
<li><p>Rob the kidnappee .. When Dzhokhars carjacked a Mercedes on Thursday night, he and his brother had one thing in mind: Get cash, and fast. They emptied $800 from an ATM using their victim&#39;s PIN number, before they reached the account limit. Holding up a stranger for money suggests a woeful lack of planning, but quick thinking given they had just bombed and murdered the MIT campus, why not some quick ATM cash?</p></li>
<li><p>Become witnesses to Armed Robbery.  7/11 coincidental meeting of robbers and bombers.  Not understanding how ATMs work. After reaching the daily withdrawal limit at one ATM, the Tsarnaevs, apparently not realizing that the machines are part of an interconnected system, decided to try their luck at two different machines. The quest to find a working ATM was how they ended up, coincidentally, at a 7/11 in Cambridge around the same time it was the scene of an armed robbery, and were spotted on the store security camera.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop for snacks. The Los Angeles Times reported that the hostage escaped after the brothers stopped at a gas station on Memorial Drive to buy snacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Where is thecarjacked Mercedes?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is green sedan, police custody no doubt, who&#39;s car is it?</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the hostage&#39;s phone. The Tsarnaevs continued on without their hostage—but they did have his phone, which allowed police to track their location via GPS. </p></li>
<li><p>About five hours after federal investigators published photos of the the two suspects taken at the Boston Marathon, police say,  they killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Thursday night and carjacked a Mercedes SUV nearby.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring a BB gun. The weapons used by the two suspects, according to police: a pressure-cooker bomb, seven IEDs, an M4 carbine, two handguns, and a BB gun. Why daisy the BB gun?</p></li>
<li><p>On Monday, April 22, it became official: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged with &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot; and &quot;malicious destruction of property resulting in death&quot; for his alleged role in last Monday&#39;s bombing of the Boston marathon. The federal criminal complaint comes three days after police captured Tsarnaev in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts, and four days after a manhunt for these specific suspects began in earnest. </p></li>
<li><p>To recap: after the FBI released images of the two on Thursday night, the men sprang into malevolent action. They first shot and killed an MIT campus police officer. Then they carjacked a man — who has not been identified but is described as a Caucasian in his 20s — and rode with him in his black Mercedes SUV. According to federal authorities, the Tsarnaevs used the man’s ATM card to withdraw $800 from bank machines in the area. Caucasian escaped/released whilst the bad men get 7/11 snacks.

<li><p>Boston, U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) today announced that he will reintroduce legislation he has proposed in a prior Congress to require that sales of explosive powder be subject to a background check.  Lautenberg&#39;s drafted damnation of all things gunpowder and subsequent amendments came hours before it was confirmed that gunpowder was the main explosive component in the Boston bombings.</p></li>
<li><p>University of Mobile’s Cross Country Coach, who was near the finish line of the Boston Marathon when a series of explosions went off, said he thought it was odd there were bomb sniffing dogs at the start and finish lines.  &quot;They kept making announcements to the participants do not worry, it&#39;s just a training exercise,&quot; Coach Ali Stevenson told Local 15.   Stevenson said he saw law enforcement spotters on the roofs at the start of the race. He&#39;s been in plenty of marathons in Chicago, D.C., Chicago, London and other major metropolitan areas but has never seen that level of security before.</p></li>
