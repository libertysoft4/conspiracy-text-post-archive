        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The German people of the late 1930s imagined themselves to be brave. They saw themselves as the heroic Germans depicted by the Wagnerian Operas, the descendants of the fierce Germanic warriors who had hunted wild boar with nothing but spears and who had defeated three of Rome&#39;s mightiest legions in the Tuetenberg Forest.</p>

<p>But in truth, by the 1930s, the German people had become civilized and tamed, culturally obsessed with fine details in both science and society. Their self-image of bravery was both salve and slavery. Germans were required to behave as if they were brave, even when they were not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to look back and realize what happened. But at the time the Hitler administration, with the help of the media, looked pretty good to the German people. Hitler was TIME Magazine&#39;s Man Of The Year in 1938; the German people assumed they were safe from a tyrant. They lived in a Republic, after all, with strict laws regarding what the government could and more importantly could not do. Their leader was a devoutly religious man, and had even sung with the boy&#39;s choir of a monastery in his youth.</p>

<p>The reality was that the German people, as individuals, had lost their courage. The German government preferred it that way as a fearful people are easier to rule than a courageous one. But the German people didn&#39;t wish to lose their self-image of courage. So, when confronted with a situation demanding individual courage, in the form of a government gone wrong, the German people simply pretended that the situation did not exist. And in that simple self-deception lay the ruin of an entire nation and the coming of the second World War.</p>

<p>When the Reichstag burned down, most Germans simply refused to believe suggestions that the fire had been staged by the Hitler administration itself. They were afraid to. But so trapped were the Germans by their belief in their own bravery that they willed themselves to be blind to the evidence before their eyes, so that they could nod in agreement with Der Fuhrer while still imagining themselves to have courage, even as they avoided the one situation which most required real courage: to stand up to governmental lies and deceptions.</p>

<p>When the Hitler administration requested temporary extraordinary powers; powers specifically banned under German law, but powers the government claimed they needed to have to deal with the &quot;communists&quot;, the German people, having already sold their souls to their self-delusions, agreed. The temporary powers were conferred, and, once conferred, lasted until Germany itself was destroyed.</p>

<p>When the Hitler administration staged a phony invasion by Poland, the vast majority of the German people, their own self-image dependant on continuing blindness to their government&#39;s deceptions, did not question why Poland would have done something so stupid as to attack Germany, and as a result Germans found themselves in a war.</p>

<p>But the German government knew they ruled a nation of cowards, and knew they had to spend the money to make the new war something cowards could fight and win. They decorated their troops with regalia to make them proud of themselves, further trapping them in their self-image. The Hitler administration copied the parade regalia of ancient Rome, to remind the Germans of the defeat of the legions at the Tuetenberg Forest. Talismans were added from orthodox religions and the occult to fill the soldiers with delusions of mystical strengths and an afterlife if they fell in battle.</p>

<p>Knowing that it takes courage to kill the enemy face to face, the Hitler administration spent vast sums of money on wonder weapons, airplanes, submarines, ultra-long range artillery, the world&#39;s first cruise missile and the world&#39;s first guided missile, weapons that could be used to kill at a distance, so that those doing the killing need not have to face the reality of what they were doing.</p>

<p>The German people were lured into WW2 not because they were brave, but because they were cowards who wanted to be seen as brave, and found that shooting long range weapons at people they could not see took less courage than standing up to the government&#39;s lies and deceptions. Sent into battle by that false image of courage, the Germans were dependent on their wonder-weapons. When the wonder-weapons stopped working, the delusion of grandeur faded, the illusion ended, the Germans lost the war.</p>

<p>The American people imagine themselves to be brave. They see themselves as the heroic Americans depicted by Western Movies, the descendants of the fierce patriot warriors who had tamed the frontier and defeated the might of the British Empire.</p>

<p>But in truth, by the dawn of the third millennium, the American people have become civilized and tamed, culturally obsessed with fine details in both science and society. Their self-image of bravery is both salve and slavery. Americans are required to behave as if they are brave, even when they are not.</p>

<p>The American people assume they are safe. They live in a Republic, after all, with strict laws regarding what the government can and more importantly cannot do. Their leader is a devoutly religious man and with the help of the media looks petty good: TIME Magazine&#39;s Man Of The Year 2000 and 2004.</p>

<p>The reality is that the American people, as individuals, have lost their courage. The government prefers it that way as a fearful people are easier to rule than a courageous one. But Americans don&#39;t wish to lose their self-image of courage. So, when confronted with a situation demanding courage, in the form of a government gone wrong, the American people simply pretend that the situation does not exist.</p>

<p>When the World Trade Towers collapsed, most Americans simply refused to believe suggestions that the attacks had been staged by parties working for the US government itself. Americans were afraid to, even as news reports surfaced proving that the US government had announced plans for the invasion of Afghanistan early in the year, plans into which the attacks on the World Trade Towers which angered the American people into support of the already-planned war fit entirely too conveniently.</p>

<p>Now the US government has requested temporary extraordinary powers, powers specifically banned under Constitutional law, but powers the government is claiming they need to have to deal with the &quot;terrorists&quot;. The American people, having already sold their souls to their self-delusions, are agreeing. The temporary powers recently conferred will be no more temporary in America than they were in Germany.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the American people, their own self-image dependant on continuing blindness to the government&#39;s deceptions, never question why Afghanistan would have done something so stupid as to attack the United States, and as a result, Americans find themselves in a war.</p>

<p>The US government knows they rule a nation of cowards. The government has had to spend the money to make the new war something cowards can fight. The government has decorated the troops with regalia to make them proud of themselves, further trapping them in their self-image. Talismans are added from orthodox religions and the occult to fill the soldiers with delusions of mystical strengths and an afterlife if they fall in battle.</p>

<p>Knowing that it takes courage to kill the enemy face to face, the United States government has spent vast sums of money on wonder weapons, airplanes, submarines, ultra-long range artillery, cruise missiles, and guided missiles, weapons that kill at a distance, so that those doing the killing need not have to face the reality of what they are doing.</p>

<p>But so trapped are Americans by their belief in their own bravery that they will themselves to be blind to the evidence before their eyes, so that they can nod in agreement with the government while still imagining themselves to have courage, even as they avoid the one situation which most requires real courage; to stand up to the government&#39;s lies and deceptions. When the wonder-weapons stop working, the delusion of grandeur fades, the illusion ends, the Americans will have lost ..... themselves.</p>

<p>The lesson from these facts is that it isn&#39;t easy to spot a genocidal tyrant when you live with one, especially one whom the press supports and promotes. Tyrants become obvious only when looking back, after what they have done becomes known. The German people did not stand up to the Hitler administration because their media betrayed them, just as the American media is betraying the American people by willingly, voluntarily, even proudly, abandoning its traditional role as watchdog against government abuse.</p>

<p>It is naive, not to mention racist, to assume that tyrants appear only in other nations and that somehow America is immune simply because &quot;we&#39;re Americans&quot;.</p>

<p>America has escaped the clutches of a dictatorship thus far only through the efforts of those citizens who, unlike the Germans of the 1930s, have the moral courage to stand up and point out where the government is lying to the people. And unless more Americans are willing to have that kind of individual courage, then future generations may well look back on the American people with the same harshness of judgement with which we look back on the 1930s Germans.</p>

<p>History is a great teacher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious to what Alex Jones has to do with this? I&#39;m also curious to why you got upvoted for completely off topic tripe, and making sure it was at the top of the comments, doing this crap in other subs gets you massive downvotes. IMO 95% of people that listen to Alex would never vote for the lunatic. Again I question your motive, because this is about Obama and Hitler, Germans and Americans. It&#39;s got nothing to do with AJ. My question to the mods is, why isn&#39;t this bottom feeder&#39;s comment deleted, and his history looked at for a possible ban? I will wager with out even looking you are a heavy poster in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, with myopic and elitist views. You fancy yourself a skeptic, but in reality you are just a lazy worthless turd, that would throw a tantrum to get out of tiresome thinking. You kick and scream if your mother says you can&#39;t play with your computer until your one chore is complete.</p>

<p>After finishing my comment, I went to your history and discovered I was exactly correct. I would now like to apologize because I feel nothing but pity for you. To the mods that don&#39;t get it, these people ruin everything they touch. They salt the very land they stand on. This guy is a top shelf astroturfer, shilling for central banking. When the hell are you going to do something about these rodents????!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s hilarious you deleted comments. What are you afraid of? Are you ashamed of something? I can help you! If you ever regret something or feel embarrassed, just remind yourself of all of the positive creative things you have done. If you search and can&#39;t remember anything, do something right then that is positive and good for humanity. If you are a lazy shit with only negative opinions and nothing to hang your hat on? Just kill yourself. It is a positive thing for humanity and your lazy ass won&#39;t have to do shit anymore. Two birds one stone. I don&#39;t have the Jewish metaphor for that, but since its similar to getting something for nothing? I&#39;m confident there are several. Again, I&#39;m making easy for you now to follow your script and call me anti-Semitic. Just do it now so I can move on.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting analysis, and I agree with much of it. However, I don&#39;t think cowardice is an accusation that can be levelled at the German nation in the 1930s or Americans today. An unshakeable belief, with some justification, of being a &quot;special nation&quot;, yes. This leads to a sort of bovine patriotism which is both a strength and a weakness - it is socially cohesive and yet is open to manipulation by unscrupulous leaders. </p>

<p>It also prevents people from speaking out for fear of ridicule or retribution. Just as Nazi Germany had Hitler&#39;s willing executioners (the complicit majority), so today&#39;s America has millions of apparently educated people who are passively facilitating their own enslavement. </p>

<p>And the world looks on in disbelief - everyone can see it, but we can do nothing - only the American people can save themselves at this point.</p>

<p>Look what these attacks do - they make people unite and support authoritarianism.  You think that governments don&#39;t know the effect these attacks have?  If you look at old footage of Hitler people loved him because he made them feel good.  That is actually what fascism is all about - bonding together, feeling good, and viewing yourselves as the victims.  Then after all the dust settles and history looks at what was done all the innocent sheep say &quot;I knew nothing.  What could I do?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I don&#39;t like either. Patriotism, Nationalism, Race Supremacy... they&#39;re all equally dangerous. Most people have no reason to be proud to be Americans. They didn&#39;t chose that life. They were born into it.</p>

<p>My father choose to immigrate to the US. He applied for his work visa, then his permanent and eventually his citizenship, as did my sister. I guess he could be proud if he wanted to. I didn&#39;t. I was born in the US. Now I live elsewhere and hope to get my residence here.</p>

<p>The only reason we have immigration laws is due to income inequality. That and racism. </p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t take pride in our genders, our nationalities, our races; none of that trivial stuff that&#39;s the product of chance or biology. If we stand for anything, it should be the entire human race, all of us, together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>now what was it i was going to say...oh right, history ,in fact, does not repeat itself.  you can learn some lessons, but they are not absolute nor should they be taken as such.  normally we compare things that are similar to some degree then contrast the differences.  we cannot do this with 1930&#39;s germany and the america of today.  the widespread use of the automobile, commercial jets, the internet, social media, and cell phones were not part of germany of the 1930&#39;s.  the german people could not learn of its governments various attrocities like we can today.  we know that america has violated state soveriegnty over and over, germans didnt know what was happening to the jews.  while it is true, today there is a large group of people that show strains of racism and ultra-nationalism, it is not the norm.  i sense in today&#39;s america that people are more open-minded and critical of our government.  instead of OP&#39;s scenario, i would paint a different picture.  there is a generational gap, im sorry to say.  the baby boomers are floundering, they dont know where to go.  under cold war times, it was as easy as us versus them.  but now, in a &quot;freer&quot; world, they still try to apply the same outdated us versus them mentality only this time towards the muslim world.  as the baby-boomers took over power, you saw the rise of a sort of oligarchy.  NAFTA, CAFTA, GATT, and other &quot;free trade&quot; agreements were made and signed by a variety of nations.  this only served to exploit the american people, because we have too many rights, and the third world workers, because they have no rights.  instead of a &quot;courageous&quot; mass as OP said, i think of mass confusion and fear.  lets face it, the world is a confusing and scary place.  this said, the older generation seeks to get rid of this confusion and fear by taking control, NDAA and the patriot act are prime examples.  this is not a hopeless cause though.  we, the youth of the nation, must strive to do better then our parents.  we must make america more equal, freer, and less tyrannical in world affairs.  regardless of political philosophy, we must realize that the American dream is no longer achievable on a wide scale, and that steps need to be taken to make it possible again.  whatsmore, the dissolution of the two party system and the revamping of our electoral system would be steps in the right direction in making the political landscape more representative of the people.  theres so much we can do, so let us takes steps into the light and out of the cave and show our brethren the way.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only we were not much further along the path to tyranny than you see.  The great mistake we are making is believing that America will be a tyrannical dictatorship like Nazi Germany.  Like you would choose to, America has already learned from the mistakes of history.  What you see going on around you is most likely a war against our liberty that will be won by the people.  </p>

<p>Sad to say it, that is irrelevant, as the government has repeatedly ignored the law of the land.  While you will win the battle over the Second Amendment, you have long lost the battle for the Fourth; and even worse you let it go without even shedding a tear.</p>

<p>The war we are losing is not the voluntary relinquishment of rights temporarily in a time of crisis or war.  Boston is not the problem.  The problem we are facing is the people&#39;s complete lack of desire for transparency in the government, their cowardly acquiescence of their privacy and right to protest.  We have stood by and watched as the NSA, FBI, and now even the IRS claim to have the right to invade our privacy and read our email.  There is much more nefarious work afoot, one day soon, if not already; the very appearance of freedom of information on the internet will be enough to keep you from understanding that information is no longer free.  </p>

<p>What do I mean?  In a world not much unlike our own, the government has already put hardware in place that will allow it to create a transparent censor wall, one in which you believe you are getting all the news you want, even crowdsourced news on places like reddit.  In reality, what you are getting is meme&#39;s and Huxley&#39;s vision of a deluge of useless information.  At the same time, the news you need, the truth about situations like Sandy Hook and Aurora is being hidden from you.  I know this is true, because I am guy on the other side of the fence.  </p>

<p>In this strange world, science appears to be progressing, because your cell phone keeps getting smaller and smaller.  At the same time, for some reason we don&#39;t even care to question, we are still powering our vehicles with a fossil fuel that is destroying the environment and costing us more and more every day.  Here, in Oz, the Internet is now in the air, instead of behind a 2400 baud modem; unfortunately at the same time, our space program is shut down completely, and in lieu of exploring space, we instead explore the inner recesses of tar sands looking for more oil to fuel the giant beast known as ExxonBush.</p>

<p>In this world it is the small battles that are lost that will destroy us, and take away our freedom.  We will look to our gun and smile, thinking we won.  Guns are not the weapons of the future, information is.  While we continue to consume news as if it were Soylient Green, we will stand by and have no idea what is coming in the next few years.  Guns will not help us, the only thing that will save us is sharing knowledge, right now.</p>

<p>There is an invasion coming, a real bona fide invasion.  You don&#39;t know because your government is lying to you.  Do you believe Roswell happened?  It did, it was the beginning of the end for us.  Listen to me carefully, the truth is about to slip right through your fingers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>National Socialist Germany was not a &quot;tyrannical dictatorship&quot;, the people were fully behind it, as well they should have been. They were tired of being manipulated by Zionist Jewish global bankers, forced into poverty and starvation.</p>

<p>The same thing will be coming here soon, and the same people will be to blame. And then, yes, we&#39;ll be the new Germans, the new Russians, victims of the same forces: we and our families, our children, will be starved, raped, and murdered, just like happened to the Germans after WW2 and the Russians under Jewish Bolshevik rule.</p>

<p>No, I wouldn&#39;t have. The Nazis started setting up concentration camps right after the election of Hitler to chancellor and began rounding up political opponents, Jews and homosexuals right away. Germany stopped being anything resembling a democracy in 1933 with the Enabling Act, two months after the election. </p>

<p>Claiming that the populace was unaware of these things is ridiculous. </p>

<p>Japan is demonized, but did Hirohito really have any choice with all the embargo placed on it by the US et al? A lot of people picked the side of the Germans because they though Germany would win, and at least then, their people would be safe. They made a tactical decision over a moral one. A lot of nations currently side with America. I wonder what will happen in a few years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you say that. Within my post high school institutions I have learned that history is an argument of the past and that there are different sides to everything. The brain washing ended for me after middle school history classes. </p>

<p>Saying that history is taught to make us obedient slaves is wrong. If you actually look into history you will be able to judge for yourselves what you believe to be the truth. It teaches you to wake up and analyze all that has happened to this point. I do agree however that the media makes it such. For example that Lincoln movie that just won all the awards. Yes it was a great movie, but now the memory of Lincoln will forever be enhanced into the idea that that movie portrays. When in reality there are historical articles and theses written that argue he was a white supremacist. </p>

<p>History is one of the greatest teachers. If you take it upon yourself to do your own research and truly understand what history is and not believe everything you hear in the early years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They control most everyone to greater and lesser degrees. The Jewish invest a great deal of money, time, and effort to media control. If you can control the information and how it is presented, you can control what people believe and how they behave. </p>

<p>Control the media, control the masses. Then profit. </p>

<p>Some people have been red pilled though. After that they are much less susceptible to mass media manipulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what is the other side?  Germany invaded Poland because...?  Invaded France because...? Tried very hard to invade the UK because...?</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the Holocaust - which even you don&#39;t come out and say didn&#39;t exist but simply &quot;was exaggerated.&quot;</p>

<p>And Germany lost.  They lost 10 to 20 <em>million</em> people...</p>

<p>Really, you&#39;re like a tiresome broken record... &quot;The Jews... the Jews.... the Jews...&quot;  Don&#39;t you know any other songs?</p>

I don&#39;t expect them to play fair considering they treat the Palestinians worse than the Torah directive which is like an animal. Just tell them to bring knives. I&#39;m going to get my 10 pounds of flesh back. Seeing as how you suck at this, I will help you with your next comment. The scripted response should simply state that I am an anti-Semite.

    <div class="md"><p>And that is why I posted what I posted: The fact that Axis atrocities happened doesn&#39;t mean that Allied atrocities did not. Stop ignoring history for whatever weird world view you have.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you look at who committed most of the atrocities, it was the Allies. Germans, in fact, were the LEAST likely to rape or murder.</p>

<p>In WW2, Germany and Japan were a force for good, and the &quot;Allies&quot; were aligned with the forces of evil, who created the war for the same reason they create false flag attacks today: to pursue their agenda, toward one-world government, destruction of all those who resist, and world headquarters in Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but were on our way to killing 6 million Arabs.</p>

<p>P.S. the number 6 million is highly inflated. The total number of people that <em>could</em> have theoretically been processed at concentration camps isn&#39;t even half that number. And that is assuming they are killing every single Jew that sets foot in a camp immediately and replacing him ASAP.</p>
