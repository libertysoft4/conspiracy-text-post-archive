    <div class="md"><p>People accuse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of being a libertarian circlejerk but the ideology is on the right track, the only way to fix societies problems is to limit the centralization of power. Psychopaths make up between 1-4% of the population, many of them are perfectly rational and logical, hiding behind a carefully constructed facade, and they abuse and manipulate people simply for the sake of abusing and manipulating them. When the capacity for abuse of power exists, it will be abused. It doesn&#39;t matter if the country is Russia, Germany, or the United States, psychopaths exist everywhere and will end up saturating power structures and continually consolidate their power and wealth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we can! Yes we can! Yes we can! </p>

<p>Barack was suppose to be our Mr.Constitutional, it was until he won his presidency that the avalanche commenced. </p>

<p>Now we are seeing the same people who supported this hypocrite, stand beside him no matter what direction he goes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about what Barack does, it&#39;s about the people clenching to their ego, making sure to defend their political color by all means. </p>

<p>Accepting that you made a horrible mistake is one of the least likely options, but continuing a perpetual state of a dystopia in the matter of debating between two parties that are both similarly deterring us from real coherency, is much- much easier. </p>

<p>Especially if you&#39;re trapped inside the paradigm and have no understanding of the bigger picture. </p>

<p>So yes, brainwashing, mind control, conditioning, diluting, processed &amp; regulated information has been a great success for the supremacy. While it remains to be an unprecedented epidemic in our general populations for decades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to note that it isn&#39;t just the subjugated who are indoctrinated. The ruling class exist in a bubble that perhaps blinds them to an even greater extent.. (positive reinforcement, sycophants, sense of entitlement, etc) </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that a dystopian soulless future is by no means guaranteed. Everyone reading these words right now was at one time or another an unenlightened person who never even considered the possibility that life was anything other than what they were told. Are we so special? Is it not possible that the natural state of man is NOT unquestioning obedience and servitude? I see no reason to think that only a small fraction of people are capable of escaping the chains of their indoctrination... on the contrary, I see it accelerating.</p>

<p>I never put him over Ron Paul, I am simply pointing out how Obama won the people over despite the millions of dollars in his campaign. </p>

<p>His entire career is a giant hypocrisy, by which he started by redundantly expressing his concerns about protecting our constitutional rights. Yea it may seem crazy, but that was the image he first begun wearing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing what Ron Paul takes shit for, when you consider what he really brings to the table.  Here we have, finally, a politician who speaks truth to power, who is honest, who values the constitution, who is consistent, who represents the people, who embraces policies consistent with the values the country was founded on...and yet people will criticize him for some accounting issues with his campaign while defending Obama,  the man in power who consistently rewards and bails out institutions that have done little more than piss on the constitution and sodomize the American people.

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck that</p>

<p>Forcing me to submit the laws as given by dead generations without input or amendment from this generation is tyranny my friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of nineteen years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right. It may be said, that the succeeding generation exercising, in fact, the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law had been expressly limited to nineteen years only</strong>. In the first place, this objection admits the right, in proposing an equivalent. But the power of repeal is not an equivalent. It might be, indeed, if every form of government were so perfectly contrived, that the will of the majority could always be obtained, fairly and without impediment. But this is true of no form. The people cannot assemble themselves; their representation is unequal and vicious. Various checks are opposed to every legislative proposition. Factions get possession of the public councils, bribery corrupts them, personal interests lead them astray from the general interests of their constituents; and other impediments arise, so as to prove to every practical man, that a law of limited duration is much more manageable than one which needs a repeal.&quot; --<strong>Thomas Jefferson to James Madison</strong>, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>... That&#39;s the difference between true patriots like Jefferson or Paine and modern &quot;libertarians&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that your interpretation of this quote only makes sense when you ignore the entire rest of Jefferson&#39;s body of work. Jefferson definitely didn&#39;t think that positive law &quot;given by dead generations&quot; is null and void; he was not a moron. He was simply a proponent of regular (and easy) changes and improvements of the constitution, and a proponent of giving the people the possibility of adopting new constitutions if it&#39;s in their will. The authors of the constitution were against that, and even adressed Jefferson&#39;s critique in the Federalist Papers (No. 80-something). They consciously made it extremely hard to change the constitution. That&#39;s why most of the constitutional changes (if you can call them that) in America go the route of judicial review by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone of anything, I&#39;m just pointing out exactly why I don&#39;t think Ron Paul is some savior and I won&#39;t be voting for him if he runs.  I won&#39;t be voting for the Democrat or Republican puppets either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Some people in this thread should realize that the US constitution is a notoriously &quot;open&quot; document that can be interpreted in a variety of ways, in contrast to other constitutions that are way more specific. It&#39;s one of the major reasons for its &quot;success&quot; - i.e. the fact no other constitution so far has managed to stay in place for over 200 years. That&#39;s why the Supreme Court is so powerful and political: the room for interpretation that the constitution leaves is so big that it can easily be read in many different ways, depending on your political stance.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no one, &quot;true&quot; way of reading the US constitution, and people who think there is simply don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. That&#39;s simply wishful thinking, a result of that ridiculous &quot;the constitution is holy and infallible&quot; ideology that&#39;s so popular in the USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are a lot of people who are disappointed with what is going on with the American government right now, but their views on how to solve it are too varied and complicated to be expressed through the current two party system. I hear a lot of the same common arguments from progressives, libertarians, moderates, etc., and they all agree that the system that we have now is serving those in power, not the public. This is inevitable for any political system, or manufactured intentionally. A lot of protections that were provided by the Constitution and Bill of Rights (4th Amendment, Citizens United), or enshrined in law (Glass Steagall) have been eroded in recent years, and neither of the two parties seem prepared to do anything about it, especially with the NSA and Syria situations dominating the MSM. Frankly, I find it all depressing. I don&#39;t see a 3rd party that is capable of uniting a such a disparate group of people against such a powerful and divisive propaganda system. Nor am I able to identify an ideology around which such individuals could be unified.</p>
