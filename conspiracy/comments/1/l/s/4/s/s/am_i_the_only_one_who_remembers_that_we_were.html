Instead of debating military/spying cutbacks and limitations, bringing to light the perjury of top administration officials under oath to Congress - we need to end the military sequester, and we must, to save humanity, wage a new war with our new ally Al Qaeda against another poor country in the Middle East. </p>

<p>Forget the NSA, while colluding with the biggest telecom companies, has been spying on Americans and giving its illegally obtained data to the DEA, IRS, among other agencies.</p>

<p>A critical and urgent war is at hand with a tiny Middle Eastern nation and we must, for the grace of all that is good, damage that dictator and his control of his country so that Al Qaeda has a better chance of gaining the upper hand.</p>

<p>We must go to war today. Assad is Hitler, right John Kerry? He is trying to take over the world. Only the United States can save us all.</p>

<p>No seriously, what can we do, maybe I should come up with this answer, but there&#39;s this thing where if no one joins you, nothing happens... that I&#39;m rightfully afraid of.</p>

<p>So where&#39;s the answer.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been disengaging lately from this conspiracy shit, and you can check my history if you think I&#39;m disinfo, but NO ONE DOES ANYTHING. Maybe it&#39;s a slow growth, but there needs to be something apparent if that&#39;s the case.</p>

<p>Only thing I can say now (and always) is to buy a defensive firearm. Personal safety and power are the best things you can have in any extreme case. I don&#39;t know what to say until then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best I can come up with is to spread awareness however you can. The keeping of secrets from the general populace seems to be the only thing allowing the elite to do business. Educating enough people to foster a real shift in public belief is going to take time though. They&#39;ve been building their empire of illusion for at least a hundred years. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s going to just crumble over night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have to hit them where it hurts: Their bank accounts. We need to find homegrown alternatives to the power grid, housing, oil, food and transportation. If all of us worked on something, I mean anything, that would reduce our dependence on the elite for any of those things, it will better humanity for all time. I am personally working on something myself. Spreading awareness is almost akin to farting in the wind. In the end it gets us almost nowhere. You have to actually make a real change and lead by example. This is how we win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  As far as banking goes, North Dakota sure seems to be on the right track. I don&#39;t even use Banks anymore, aside from small town credit unions. I even sold my vehicle and use my bike for transportation. Veggies in the garden too. We are capable of being a lot more self-sufficient than we let ourselves believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, there is a significant population of people who really <em>do</em> depend on the government, and either can&#39;t afford or aren&#39;t willing to inconvenience themselves in any way, no matter how shitty the government is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. Aside from the people who honestly can not support themselves, (mentally/physically disabled, homeless, supporting others, or what ever their situation is) aside from them, what I see a lot of happening is people who don&#39;t care. They don&#39;t care to better themselves, to get a better job and pay for their own apartment/phone/family etc. When you are in a financially distressed situation and you receive money from the govt, even if you have the opportunity to get out of it, why would they? It&#39;s like this mindset that they&#39;re getting &quot;free money&quot;. I remember when I was younger, getting welfare or any other financial aid through the govt was not something to be proud of. Now I hear people bragging about their &quot;free cell phone&quot; or &quot;food stamps&quot; or whatever it is. No wonder the POTUS still has support, even after all the shitty things that he does. He has the support of all of these people. Sorry if rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to take a look at the welfare situation a little more closely. It may not have been designed as a poverty trap, but that&#39;s what it&#39;s become. </p>

<p>Personal anecdote. I&#39;m a single dad, divorced a few years ago and have a couple of kids that live with me. Shortly after the divorce, my previous employer offered me a raise that I had to refuse. </p>

<p>Why? Because if I reported the raise, I would lose food stamps - and those were worth more than the raise! There was no way I could feed my family without them. </p>

<p>I imagine there are plenty of people in the same situation - a better job would see them lose more in benefits than the financial gains. </p>

<p>The system works as a trap - assisting until you&#39;re just able to stand on your feet - then kicking a leg from under you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the way things are going, I wouldn&#39;t personally move to a large city so I understand that. It&#39;s in good shape speaking economically. 
Employment is hit or miss, depending on the demographic you fall into. It&#39;s mostly a retirement based community, so healthcare is in great demand, but good luck finding anything technical like programming or engineering. There just isn&#39;t a market for it in our small city unless you can drive 40 minutes to and from a bigger city. I&#39;ll tell you what though, I feel a hell of a lot safer living here than anywhere in a large city or capital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not afraid of laboring, but I had a bicycling accident last year and broke both me arms (one was backwards at the elbow, and it had to be put together with screws).

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely not for everyone, I understand.  The reason I said not to be afraid of being a laborer is because my hometown is FULL of people unwilling to work a 40 hr per week job and be home every night because you get free food stamps and way better medical coverage if you stay in the welfare system, so that&#39;s what they do.  Its sickening.  These same people would never last a full day out in my environment.  At the first time hearing the word &quot;laborer&quot;, they would imagine back-breaking work from sun up til sun down, and obviously wouldn&#39;t want to do that.  Secondly, it must be something about a small town, but everybody that has a wife/girlfriend can&#39;t stand the thought of only being home on weekends.  I can&#39;t stand insecure people; I can&#39;t understand that mentality.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your injuries.  Hope your day to day life hasn&#39;t been to drastically affected.  You should be through the worst of the lifestyle changes after a year&#39;s time, But I know what you mean.  I have a joint condition myself, and I have to watch how much I strain my knees and back, or they will bother me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you don&#39;t have a friend or family member to put a good word in for you, my best advice would be to ask around either at a busy gas station between 5-6 AM or at a bar that serves good food anytime after 6 PM and look for somebody who looks like they work in the gas/oilfield and just ask them if they know any companies that are looking for people, or ask where the closest yard is and go there around 7 AM and ask the people in the job trailer (not the tool trailer; the one that&#39;s like an office).  Be polite, but try not to make it too awkward.  I really cant think of any other way to go about getting into that field.  I have a friend who got laid off and was looking for work last year, and I didn&#39;t want him using my name to get in anywhere,in case he made a bad name for himself like on his last job, so I told him to look up a certain company and apply online.  He did, and never heard anything back.  I imagine that&#39;s how most companies are, because there&#39;s enough people asking for a job in person that they never even need to look at applications that have been submitted online.  Its kind of a buddy system and it can be hard to get in without a &quot;buddy&quot; to get you in, but once you in and you prove yourself, you know you can also get other friends on.  That&#39;s how every crew is - a group of friends.  If you work with the same group of guys 6 days a week, you become like family.  We tell jokes, laugh, and have a good old time all day while we work and get what we need to get done that day.  All the while being outside breathing fresh air, enjoying the scenery (where I&#39;m working there&#39;s lots of hills and mountains).  If it rains, you get paid 4 hrs of standby time and go back to the hotel room and play video games all day.  There&#39;s not a lot of people who can say they love what they do, but I&#39;m one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose &quot;spread awareness&quot; isn&#39;t entirely accurate for what I had in mind. I&#39;m talking about really taking the time to educate people as to why these issues matter and how it is affecting them. This means more than holding a sign with a catchy slogan or chanting some sound bite mini message at a protest. It means more than posting a link on Facebook with the tag line &quot;THIS BLOWS! TELL EVERYONE!&quot;. It means getting down to it one on one or small groups and really engaging in a dialogue about the problems we face. Educating is a lot more challenging than simply telling, and requires the educator to really know their shit. So &quot;teach everyone&quot; is more what I meant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one does anything?  </p>

<p>How about Edward Snowden?  How about anonymous?  How about releasing files on the federal reserve?  How about releasing files on the banks, credit card companies and US Military?</p>

<p>Many of these people are probably readers of conspiracy sites, Alex Jones, Coast to Coast and forums like this one.  </p>

<p>There was a <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/justinesharrock/anonymous-secret-presence-in-the-us-army">recent article in Buzzfeed</a> about the proliferation of Anonymous members in the military.  Many of them were hackers who joined because they wanted access to secrets and to learn how the world really works.  Now that they&#39;ve found out they&#39;re starting to leak.</p>

<p>We wouldn&#39;t be talking about the NSA if it weren&#39;t for the internet and people not trusting the government.  We wouldn&#39;t be talking about NOT going into Syria if it weren&#39;t for the internet.  If this was 1996 and CNN and NBC news told the nation that chemical weapons were used in Syria we&#39;d all be outraged and ready for war.  There would be no dissenting voices from the official narrative, which the internet now provides.</p>

<p>Things are getting better, we&#39;re just more awake to how bad it&#39;s gotten.  It has been and will be a slow growth, but it&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>Just ask Zbigniew Brzezinski. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That goes right back at you, and buying a gun for &#39;personal protection&#39; isn&#39;t doing shit other than showing how selfishly you think.</p>

<p>At what point of other people actually &#39;doing&#39; things will you finally join into the fray? How does discouraging the movement and the not acknowledging that higher level of awareness that is obviously present help anything that you seem to be so bitter about? Why do you feed the fires that you say you despise?</p>

<p>The problem are people like you; unwilling to even entertain a changing world, but would rather bitch and moan and point fingers at others. Maybe people in the USA aren&#39;t doing much, but the rest of the world is continuing to move forward. The technology will continue to spread and soon the US won&#39;t have the power it once did. At that point, it won&#39;t matter what the American people do anymore... So what are you &#39;doing&#39; right now? If the answer is nothing, you have no right to demand anything from others in that regard.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about knowledge and activation. If even 10% of the public cared about an issue, was knowledgeable about it, and used this process, I don&#39;t think the ROI would be slim at all. There&#39;s a networking externality involved in the system. If 10% of people took just an hour of their time writing a LTE on a given issue, I think the net effect of their combined efforts would in many cases change the outcome of votes in Congress.</p>

<p>And what&#39;s the current scheduling of medical marijuana? Has that changed? I know Obama said he&#39;s willing to defer to states rights on that, but is that concrete yet? Have the Federal raids on dispensaries stopped? Was that decision made in response to people writing letters, or in response to state level descisions which &quot;required&quot; Federal resources to respond to violently, resources that are now needed &#39;elsewhere&#39;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the educated belief that there&#39;s (been) an agenda at play in this country and worldwide, that doesn&#39;t set it&#39;s timetable to the wiles of the American public, expressed or otherwise. That it does, in fact, steer the desires and conversations of the American public. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also worked with the American public at large, and I can promise you the signal to noise ratio you&#39;re assuming is highly optimistic. That can&#39;t change without <em>better education</em>. And that won&#39;t come from schools. It comes from independently engaged citizens like you and me, trying to inform people of what is actually being done outside the halls of &quot;publicly&quot; controlled media. </p>

<p>There&#39;s any number of recent items that indicate to a large degree that our system of governance is co-opted. Not the least of which is ubiquitous surveillance of our elected officials. So you can write all the letters in the world, but I assure you our elected officials are more afraid of stepping on the toes of insiders than the faceless electorate. </p>

<p>This has been linked from this sub before, but a group of redditors are attempting to start a new version of a link aggregator, with a focus on free speech for everybody, transparency of the website, and complete equality.

<p>It will attempt to seperate the &quot;superficial&quot; posts, which tend to clog reddit and offer distractions, from what&#39;s actually important, and will have a large focus on keeping the community active, engaged, and hopefully, productive.</p>

<p>You may be interested in checking it out, seeing what we are about, and maybe joining, as we hope to offer, among many other things, a free, open place to discuss precisely what it is we need to do to promote the ideals that our Constitution guaranteed, which have been systematically stripped from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What can we do?</p>

<p>Have you read the Constitution. The 2nd Amendment tells us what to do.</p>

<p>See, last time we weren&#39;t being represented, and were angry about it, was 1775.</p>

<p>We sit here and watch other countries rebel against governments spying on them, imprisoning them, taking their children... you know, all the stuff our own government does to us. </p>

<p>And you ask, &quot;What can we do?&quot;.</p>

<p>Just by asking that... And your comment rising to the top. Shows we all know SOMETHING must be done. But we have been raised to accept the authoritarianism that is keeping us sitting on our asses, glued to a screen, waiting for someone else to do something.</p>

<p>Wait long enough... someone else will, though they will probably be Russian or Chinese. When we show our weakness as a people, and rally or &quot;occupy&quot; enough to distract our own government, I&#39;m almost positive we&#39;ll be able to welcome our foriegn liberators. </p>

<p>Or we can do it ourselves. The choice, is ours.</p>

<p>Edit: Spelling</p>

<p>TL;DR: Is it time for &#39;The American Spring&quot;?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be pessimistic. You could be out engaging people on the street with booklets of information, it&#39;s not &quot;conspiracy shit&quot; anymore dude. There&#39;s dozens of legitimate newspapers around the world reporting on a lot of this. It&#39;s factual. I try and personally spread information from legitimate sources, not conspiritard sources, legitimate real trusted sources. Petition your local politicians, gather their contact information and go around your town talking about this stuff and ask people to email your local politicians. Maybe it won&#39;t do anything, but the more pressure we put on people, and the more people we make aware, the better.</p>

<p>Seriously, It really bothers me that people still don&#39;t get this. Sure it might not change anything overnight, but why are you asking what we can do? There&#39;s plenty we can do to go out there and engage people. On the other hand, if you look like a crazy person, please just stick to whining on the Internet. There&#39;s too many crazy people out there ranting as it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to this article they are two separate calls: </p>

<p>&quot;A senior U.S. official, speaking only on the condition of anonymity because the information is classified, said the intercepted call wasn’t the same communication that American officials had cited to bolster their case that Syrian President Bashar Assad was responsible for the attack.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>uh thanks I didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>Edit: I researched it a bit and I am not so sure anymore. I was not referring to the info the BND leaked to the Spiegel (which the article you linked talks about) but to the info the Mossad leaked to the <a href="http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/krise-in-der-arabischen-welt/syrien/bundeskanzlerin-im-focus-interview-giftgasmassaker-in-syrien-merkel-fordert-zugang-fuer-un-inspekteure_aid_1080416.html">Focus</a>. The article mentions a Unit 8200 of the Mossad who supposedly intercepted this communication. I believe this is indeed the same source Kerry is using.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re being sarastic, but it looks like a hearing already took place. </p>

<p>Anyway, i found the one you&#39;re talking about. It&#39;s an informal congressional hearing in which Glenn Greenwald (columnist for The Guardian) was supposed to testify via satellite. That was cancelled and they planned to reschedule in September.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about that guy. Don&#39;t discount your education as long as it is pointed in the fullest direction. I was going to say &quot;right direction&quot; but your school will say that right is one thing, and your friends and parents another, and this sub reddit another.</p>

<p>So take a broad look. EDUCATE your self beyond class, but get the schooling too. A person can do a LOT and there is a growing market for things BECAUSE of the NSA stuff. Like secure communications for one. Affordable civilain security. Information tech and disemination.</p>

<p>Right now all anyone can do is learn and tell others. And maybe consider how to secure the future.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your problem, right there.  You&#39;re lazy and unwilling to sacrifice anything to see the outcome you want.  I promise you that the wealthy who are fucking you are <em>more</em> than willing to sacrifice everything to see the outcome <em>they</em> want, and the fruits of those sacrifices are playing out right now in front of you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?id=252218&amp;amp;sid=212226">http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?id=252218&amp;amp;sid=212226</a></p>

<p><strong>Abner Mikva, the former Chicago congressman, federal judge and White House counsel to President Bill Clinton, puts a 21st-century twist on the notion that Clinton was &quot;the nation&#39;s first black president.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p><strong>&quot;I think when this is all over, people are going to say that Barack Obama is the first Jewish president,&quot; he said.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Mikva, a powerful figure in local and national Democratic politics for decades, was one of Sen. Obama&#39;s early admirers, beginning in 1990 when he tried to hire the brilliant student and first black president of the Harvard Law Review for a coveted clerkship. (Obama turned him down, saying he was going to move to Chicago and run for public office. &quot;I thought that showed a lot of chutzpah on his part,&quot; Mikva says with a laugh.)</strong></p>

<p>Since then, Mikva&#39;s support for and nurturance of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has never wavered. <strong>He is one of many influential Chicago Jews who have been among Obama&#39;s earliest and most ardent backers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>One longtime Jewish observer of the political scene, who did not want to be identified, said admiringly that &quot;Jews made him. Wherever you look, there is a Jewish presence.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Assad is Hitler, right John Kerry?</p>

<p>There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 caliber machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages. All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry#Media_appearances">source</a></p>

<p><del>TIL</del>  Today I remembered Kerry killed women &amp; children {codenames: &quot;civilians/people&quot;} with 50 caliber machine guns. He is a self admitted war criminal that drove weak frail lesser unable to defend themselves in a fair fight civilians from their homes with fire. </p>

<p>Worthy to be an American Statesman in an alternate house of cards universe held together currently in America by Operation Paperclip bulit on skulls &amp; bones.</p>

<p>Free fire zones sounds hitleresque</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly we should just wait for the end game. The wheels have been turning for decades and Syria is the country they need to export oil from Iraq and Iran via the medeteranian sea. Once America has Syria they can suck whatever profits they can squeeze out of the middle east. Eventually oil will no longer be a viable option for profiteering but sadly we are decades away from that. Revolution is the only thing that would stop the landslide but as long as Americans have a comfy couch and netflix dying in the street seems unnessicary. Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will give one small example.</p>

<p>In my college class (more than one of them) the teachers are talking about how they agree and we should go to war with Syria.</p>

<p>This is bigger than just our government. Me, You, OP, we are all in the minority.</p>

<p>When I stated that Russia submitted 100 page report to the UN showing why it was the syrian rebels and not the syrian military I was told that conspiracy is easy to debate.</p>

<p>Even in a college setting we are supposed to blindly follow our supreme leader any marks or comments against him or a varying opinion you have just ostricized yourself congradulations you won&#39;t be getting an A in the class.</p>

<p>The magazines that we use in extemp are such like Time and Newsweek. Our online sources we can use in extemp are Huffington Post.</p>

<p>I believe we all need to zoom out and focus on what the majority dictates as factual and intellctual discussion and evidence. The NSA watching all of us will happen and it will just get worse it is time to move on to even larger topics how can a Hydra be destroyed?</p>

<p>As cautious as I am to do so, because the general population of this sub is often both crazy and breathtaking gullible, I have to agree with you, the suddenness with which this bomb-Syria push became an instantly huge priority for this administration is pretty suspect.</p>

<p>I control-f&#39;d for &quot;Clinton&quot;, and didn&#39;t find anyone mentioning that the last time the US ramped up to and then executed a punitive and truly limited bombing like this is being proposed as was under President Clinton, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Iraq_%281998%29#Distraction_from_Clinton_impeachment_scandal">in the midst of his impeachment</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NSA scandal is so huge and involves so many both within the United States and outside, in particular my own country the UK, that its no wonder that both governments and the MSM are plugging Syria. From any point of view this scandal is immensely embarrassing so, if you were a politician/intelligence bureaucrat/intelligence contractor etc and in the position to do so, why wouldn&#39;t you emphasise such a dramatic and long term issue as Syria? You surely would want the spotlight off you and your partners in crime.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the United States might not even go into Syria and as such any possible negative consequences of intervention simply wouldn&#39;t materialise and yet the government and other implicated parties in the NSA scandal will have succeeded in, at least for a time, distracting the public enough to reduce the outrage. However if they do go into Syria they&#39;ll be able to get rid of Assad and weaken both Iranian and Russian influence in the region amongst other benefits.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really that stupid at all but rather an effective method of PR and, dare I say, a way of killing two birds with one stone. Distract the public and get rid of Assad.</p>
