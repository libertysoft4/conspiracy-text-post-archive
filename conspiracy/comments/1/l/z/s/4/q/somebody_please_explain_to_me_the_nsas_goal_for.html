    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s not enough.  There MUST be an end game.  You&#39;re pretty simple-minded if you want power for power&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>The folks doing this are anything BUT simple-minded.  They know damn well what they&#39;re doing.  Which means they&#39;re doing this with an actual goal in mind.  Absolute power isn&#39;t the end-game, it&#39;s just the next component they need in their plan.</p>

<p>Nobody with two brain cells to rub together wants power for power&#39;s sake.  They want power so they can DO something with it.  Why?  Because what&#39;s the point of being the most powerful person in [given locale scope] if you&#39;re not gonna do anything with it?</p>

<p>There&#39;s an endgame to this.  I don&#39;t know what it is, but I guarantee that the plan is not the goal; the plan is the plan.  The goal is to make us dance a certain way, not to gain the power to pull our strings.</p>

<p>What they&#39;re own system of governance will be is unknown but I do believe that system will likely erode away quickly. If these people have been wholly consumed with chess-like tactics of control and consolidation of power for the past hundred or so years then once they get it would they not then fall upon one another like starved dogs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, do you really think that if an interstellar species wanted to make their presence known, that some pitifully arcane government on a backwater pre-stellar civilization could prevent word from getting out? Or, conversely, do you think that if a stellar civilization <em>didn&#39;t</em> want their presence to be known, that some backwater cavemen could find them out?</p>

<p>Try taking more of an interrest in the technological requirements for interstellar travel and you will quickly figure out that the tech of an interstellar species would so vastly outstrip ours that it would appear to us as magic, and we would scarcely appear as an intelligent species to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no dude, i dont believe interstellar aliens would follow that logic.</p>

<p>i do seriously consider, however (not 100% believe), that perhaps through being decades ahead of us technologically, our government has the ability to &quot;fake&quot; aliens. revealing themselves as gods through shock and awe is what i meant. i dont believe for a second they would have the ability to keep a lid on things if real aliens are involved. unless they&#39;ve been working with aliens (highly unlikely) and the aliens themselves are fine with all the human manipulation and suffering, in which case fuck the aliens because their agenda probably isnt good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we know that Hitler made a &quot;UFO&quot; model that was able to fly (technically not a  UFO, since we know what it was, but that&#39;s the image he was going for). And it&#39;s obvious that religion has often been used as a means to control large groups of people, so the control explanation makes more sense to me than the real thing. I do suspect that other life forms exist, simply because of the vastness of the universe and the apparently prolific existence of habitable planets. It seems very statistically likely. But it is also very statistically likely that we are the only life within the vicinity of several hundred lightyears, since we&#39;ve looked pretty thoroughly at nearby stars and planets, most of which have no discernable planets in habitable zones. And since our radio transmissions into space have not even been broadcasting for 100 years, they can&#39;t have reached more than 100 lightyears into space, so any other life form probably doesn&#39;t even known that we exist yet, to come and visit us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree 100%. </p>

<p>there just has to be life out there, but id bet the vast majority of it is confined to whatever hidden planets it popped up on.</p>

<p>i still think it makes sense for the elites to make up an alien story/history to control us though. maybe thats being too paranoid, but keeping an open mind isnt a bad thing either.</p>
