        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw this outraging documentary on youtube yesterday about how the FDA has been suppressing a cancer drug since the late 80&#39;s that had a better track record and that was non-toxic. (ill explain more below)</p>

<p>Outraged, the first thing I thought to do after the movie was to go on reddit and tell everyone because I hadn&#39;t seen anything about it until my dad showed me. </p>

<p>I go on TIL and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1lyj8n/til_a_10x_more_effective_nontoxic_cure_for_cancer/">post this</a> and it got 3 upvotes within 30 seconds but was off the new queue within minutes. Confused, I decided to take a look at the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/duplicates/1lyj8n/til_a_10x_more_effective_nontoxic_cure_for_cancer/">&quot;Other Discussions&quot; tab</a> only to see all the other times the link was posted on any sub it was taken down because of &quot;bad post title&quot;, which none of them had. (strange right?)   </p>

<p>If you dont feel like watching the hour long documentary it is about this Dr. Burzynski and his non-toxic protein based cancer treatment that he discovered in the 70&#39;s in russia. He comes to America to further pursue research on the treatment. After about 15 years he perfects it and starts seeing positive results with children with brain tumors that would have otherwise had a 0 chance of living past 5 years with standard radiation and chemo therapy. Great right? wrong?</p>

<p>Once the FDA starts to hear of this &quot;new&quot; cancer treatment they start harassing him with 5 court cases in which he won all. After he won those 5 by actually bringing survivors to court, the FDA still pursued more court cases, charged him with life in prison, got him in jail for a couple days but got out soon after and was found not guilty of all 75 charges. </p>

<p>Puzzled by all this, Dr. Burzynski concludes that the only reason he&#39;s being harassed is because the of the trillion dollar cancer industry that would collapse because of this medicine that big pharma-companies dont have a patent on. The reason the FDA is harassing Dr. Burzynski is because a law was lobbied to be put in place in the 70&#39;s or 80&#39;s that basically put the FDA on the payroll of the big pharma-companies.</p>

<p>What I wrote doesn&#39;t even do justice on the story, I urge you to watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUGVkmmwbk">free documentary on youtube</a> and now im being suppressed from showing Reddit.  </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I messaged the Mod&#39;s of TIL with my concern, ill post back here when I get a response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Burzynski makes a whole lot of money selling this crap to desperate cancer patients, and has a history of trying to silence his victims by throwing lawyers at them. The only evidence for this snake oil comes from his own sham &quot;studies&quot; - independent researchers have never been able to reproduce his work, and he hasn&#39;t published a single peer-reviewed clinical trial evaluating antineoplaston therapy despite trying to organize over sixty trials.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just the FDA and NCI who think he&#39;s full of crap. It&#39;s the scientific consensus of a number of national health agencies and private scientific organizations, including the Mayo Clinic, the UK&#39;s largest cancer research authority, and the American Cancer Society. This stuff has just as many side effects as conventional chemotherapy, and you&#39;re taking the word of a Youtube documentary over the scientific consensus because Burzynski himself says his magic (and expensive) cancer pills work?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so quick to point out greed in some places and totally ignore it in others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DID YOU WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY? thats what the FDA and the NCI all want you to think. There is trilions of dollars on the line. They could spoof a wikipedia page. I was reading it before and it sounded very biased. All the information on there is sourced from biased articles. Even the National Cancer Institute is in on the shady business. The NCI is like &quot;papa&quot; to the medical community so they listen to whatever it says. To make it even more shady, the chairman of the NCI became the chairman of the FDA while this was going on (it still is).  I urge you to watch at least the first 3 minutes and then reply.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the evidence, paperwork, and facts is in the documentary if yo u watch it. There were supposed to be 40 patients tested with certain constraints on the type of patients. The FDA after they agreed to on the details of the study changed the dosage and admitted more sick patients than agreed to because &quot;the constraints set on admittance were too limiting&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>and to better reply to your statement. All his his stuff has been tried and proven in court. So the &quot;Medical Community&quot; aka NCI says its not proven because of some shady stuff they did with clinical trials (watch the video) and then this gets seen on wikipedia.

<p>Not sure what you mean by that. Burzynski has generally been unsuccessful in his many legal cases, and in any case the court system is not the arbiter of scientific validity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking the time to watch the video, there are too many people that will look at it and brush it off as nonsense because of how absurd the notion is. I was disgusted by this video. It shows how unsympathetic the FDA are to humans and how loyal they are to money. I dont understand why, in todays world, does evidence like this not provoke an internal investigation in the FDA or a congress oversight committee or something. The lack of accountability in this country is why history repeats itself. Us citizens need to have a little more power to intervene when something goes terribly wrong like this. The chairman of the FDA who has interest in the NCI needs to be investigated, charged, and put before a judge for conflict of interest. And if he is not doing anything wrong &quot;legally&quot;, morally there should be laws put in place to prevent it from happening again. I wish I could do more than just post here.</p>
