<p>I think it&#39;s amusing to contemplate the idea that a malevolent state has set up reddit as a way to channel the vital energies of a disaffected minority away from any effective action in the real world.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that the true numbers of people reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is 17,776, or even 1,777 ... how would anyone know, based upon the people voting, posting and commenting here?</p>

<p>Is there any external evidence that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is having any effect on the real world whatsoever?</p>

<p>&quot;the 1% rule or the 90–9–1 principle (sometimes also presented as 89:10:1 ratio)[1] is a rule of thumb pertaining to participation in an internet community. According to this principle, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. Specifically, this rule applies to collaborative websites such as YouTube or Wikipedia. The 1% rule refers to forums, in which everyone must be a content creator. In this context, only 1% of the users of a forum actively create new posts and the other 99% of the participants only lurk.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how many people are actually active on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>If you checked the comment history, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> achieves about 100 comments per hour, and many of these comments would be from the same person.</p>

<p>I think it would be fair to say that from this number, the total number of participants is likely to be ~1,000 people in a time period of a week or so.</p>

<p>That would indicate that the total readership would be close to 100,000.</p>

<p>But why is the number for forums so low, at 1% ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a tool to manipulate your beliefs and perception.  Peer pressure is the most powerful tool to control what you think and believe to be the truth. There are submissions and comments placed here by special interest that attack free thought. Terms like conspiritards and tin foil hats are their tools to intimidate and manipulate. Polls and statistics are cherry picked to keep everyone on the same page. Back up and look at the big picture. Where is all of this coming from and where is it all going? Who benefits and who will suffer? Why would a person say what they are saying; to what end? If you were the government, what would be the ideal tool to control what people say, believe and think?
