<p>Even though Zionism does not necessarily mean Jew in and of itself, Zionism <em>did</em> indeed actually <em>come</em> from Judaism.  Zionism is a militant, racist form of Judaic ideology that sprang from and <em>originated</em> from a particular Judaic interpretation, and the biggest most overwhelming percentage of Zionists actually <em>are</em> in fact Jews - &quot;elite&quot; Jews that can be as prejudiced to &quot;non-elite&quot; Jews as they can to &quot;gentiles&quot;, but they are Jews none the less.  Those Zionists that are not Jewish are the exception - not the rule.</p>

<p>Not <em>all</em> Jews are Zionists, of course, but to not understand and acknowledge the direct connection between the two ideologies is not being very intelligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very possible, I could be underestimating the bored teenage element. But to me, those who act as obvious provocateurs are very unlikely to be shills. In my understanding of effective shilling a shill might say something more subtle...for example....if someone brings up government involvement during 9/11 in a large subreddit, they wouldn&#39;t act like a ass. They would simply say something like &quot;oh boy, another tin foil hat wearer&quot;. The attempt being to discredit while at the same time completely side stepping the discussion. Then again, multiple accounts would be employed to upvote the tin foil hat statement and downvote the 9/11 comment thus giving a false popular opinion.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to disagree. Go look at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. Trolling and getting conspiracy advocates to say some stupid shit is literally their favorite past time. Take some time to talk with these guys (not over there, but when they come in here). I make an effort to always spark up conversations with them. Many are just misinformed, but others literally get off on trying to make us look stupid. Im not saying shills dont exist. They definitely do. And im not saying for certain that some of these guys arent shills. But to definitively say they are or arent is an unsupported conclusion. And i think its fairly evident, when you look at their post history and talk to them, that most are not shills. We can speculate all we want, but claiming someone is a definitively a shill, (which you <em>are</em> doing when you say call them one, whether you realize it or not) especially when people havent even attempted to spark a inquiring conversation with them, is not valid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until a year ago, I considered the use of &quot;shill&quot; to simply be a small-minded way to attack or dismiss someone that disagrees with you (usually used by the least rational of paranoids).

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>One common trick to cheat people to believe fake products or a high-return low-risk investment scheme in the online discussion groups is to make use of sockpuppets (i.e., use different fake identities pretending to be different persons to praise or create the illusion of support for the product). A fundamental problem is how to identify these sockpuppets. In this paper, we propose two approaches to identify these puppet pairs that occur in the same forum as well as
cross forum. <strong>The evaluation based on millions of real posts in two popular discussion forums in Hong Kong shows that the methods are effective.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pulled that from a series of whitepapers I read a few years back. I wont link them because I ran into a few questionable, possibly malicious, links associated with the forums used in the algo tests. <strong>Vigilance and diligence are synonymous.</strong></p>

<p>But I will point you in the direction to look if you&#39;d like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills do certainly exist. Whether they are posting on reddit, there is some evidence but there is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming majority of people called shills in this sub are not shills. If before calling someone a shill you actually looked at their post history it would be pretty apparent that they are in fact trolls who get off on making us blow up on them–they look at us like religious zealots who believe things without evidence and are devoid of skepticism (and in many cases they arent wrong), so they like to see what stupid things they can get us to say and usually they get a few to fall for it. Other times, they are well meaning misinformed people. I have never, in the dozens of alleged shills whose post history ive looked through or whom ive conversed with, ever seen any conclusive proof that these people are in fact paid to do what they are doing. Thus calling someone a shill, unless you have their bank statement is not only an unfounded conclusion but it further perpetuates the belief that this community is incapable of critical thinking and that we have nothing worth saying. Next time you want to call someone a shill, ask yourself why are you really calling them a shill and is it really worth it? The only thing it does is inflate your ego and convince you that you are right and they are wrong. Nothing else. Its not going to convince them that they are wrong. Its not going to bring credibility to this community. Its not going to bring new people to this community. Its not going to do anything good. All is does is make <em>you</em> feel good. If thats all you want, then fine, but just know that youre only further digging this movement into hopelessness. </p>

<p>Thats my take anyway.</p>

<p>If anyone would like to contest this opinion id be happy to reconsider my position.  </p>

<p>-Are they a brand new account?  If so, here very suspect.</p>

<p>-Do they always strictly post in favor of one subject?  A history of just that subject (ex. adamwho for Monsanto)</p>

<p>-Do they show up when keywords are mentioned?  GMO/Monsanto, 9/11, WTC, Israel/Mossad, etc.  If so, they are likely paid shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure theres shills.  But they&#39;re not here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> most of the time.  This is a sub for people so set in their beliefs that no amount of &quot;proof&quot; could ever persuade them because for most, the <strong>conspiracy</strong> is so deep that anything coming from the establishment...hell, <em>any</em> establishment, is just more shilling.  There isn&#39;t a single person past/present/future working for the government that could ever convince a diehard <a href="/r/conspirator">/r/conspirator</a> that, say, 9/11 wasn&#39;t a false flag.  The <strong>only</strong> acceptable opinions about the establishment are those claiming that things are not what they seem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we probably can&#39;t have a real discussion about it.  I always get labeled a shill, since I often don&#39;t agree with the prevailing opinions in this sub.  Of course, I am not a shill for anyone, and I love a good spirited discussion.  But, that&#39;s generally not possible, since if you don&#39;t toe the party line, so to speak, you are just downvoted and insulted, so as to stifle any discussion.  It really doesn&#39;t matter how sound the argument, or how much evidence backs your assertion.  If it&#39;s not pro-conspiracy, good-bye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so this is another aspect. False labeling. I think it is fair to say that some people, perhaps not the majority, support what are perceived as &quot;shill positions&quot; all on their own. Unfortunately, false labeling, in my opinion, further destabilizes the potential discussions. I try to be careful of who I accuse. But even doing so I still wonder....maybe this person really just loves fossil fuel companies??? Or Monsanto. Some people do and I don&#39;t want to exclude them from a useful discussion. That said, in my experience, those folks don&#39;t want to hear a damn thing and generally are just useless mouthpieces -paid or not. I also think effective shilling can be somewhat sophisticated. Taking a simple comment about...oh...class mobility or something pro-American dream...saying something unassuming like. &quot;It&#39;s about hard work people, I grew up poor and started with nothing, and now I own my own business.&quot; And then, legions of shill accounts will simply upvote that comment anonymously. Thereby giving it the false endorsement of the masses. When in fact class mobility has been on the decline for decades. And the poor and middle class are becoming poorer.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to tell, actually.  I can certainly understand, for instance, an atheist subreddit getting tired of religious folks coming in and just saying nothing more than &quot;you&#39;re wrong and stupid and going to hell.&quot;  (Personally, I don&#39;t go to the religious subreddits, though, since I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything do debate there.)</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, no matter what I am discussing if it&#39;s a real, topical issue of the day, if people who think otherwise explain why they think otherwise, I usually enjoy the debate, even sometimes for no other reason that it challenges me to perhaps go do more digging.  Sometimes I learn something about myself.</p>

<p>One quick example (which is not necessarily a conspiracy-related one) is that for years, I argued that taxes were necessarily complicated.  There is a lot there in the tax code, and while I am still convinced that <em>most</em> people want simplification because they&#39;re too lazy to grow up and simply do their taxes, which can be complicated (combined with some who are misled into thinking they will pay less tax with a simpler code); within the past year or so, I realized that this is not the <em>only</em> reason.  There are valid reasons for wanting to simplify the tax code which have nothing to do with laziness or stupidity on the part of the taxpayers.  I would probably not have realized this without having many discussions on the topic.</p>
