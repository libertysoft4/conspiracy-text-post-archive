<p>True. But these folks were/are trying to pull this off in a somewhat more subtle fashion, so as not to alarm the public. Sort of like death by a thousand cuts. This way, assuming no one was the wiser, they wouldn&#39;t be blamed for the outcome and yet would reap the reward, in their eyes.</p>

<p>There are so many facets involved with genocide that to only think the reasons are obvious are exactly how they want you to feel about them.</p>

<p>YOU TRULY believe that the Holocaust was ALL about one crazy german man hating jews so he was able to swiftly carry out this plot? No. There were many minds behind this, much money behind it, and much science behind it all. Hitler was mostly a tool, like Obama is a tool. Hitler was a smarter man than Obama, that&#39;s for sure.

    <div class="md"><p>The psychology behind the Holocaust is interesting and nothing&#39;s for sure, but it largely resulted from the combination of nationalism, xenophobia, and racism that are biologically ingrained in the most primal part of human nature. Germany was practically boiling over already (in no small part due to WWI), and Hitler&#39;s cult of personality turned the whole mess into a perfect storm.</p>

<p>At its core, Nazi Germany was a deadly cocktail of pride and power. Evil, yes. Sinister and calculated, hardly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Efficient? It was a clusterf**k. The Nazis squandered an enormous amount of forced labor with their &quot;extermination through labor&quot; (working prisoners to death) policy, they haphazardly shifted strategies every couple months, and they managed to incite robust and debilitating resistance movements in every country they occupied.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying the Jews secretly planned the torture and near-annihilation of their entire race? They orchestrated the oppressive anti-Judaism laws that made life hell for them in Germany even in the entire decade before the Holocaust? I&#39;d like to see some citations of credible historical evidence for that, please. Because it doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fairly small ethnic group, has been for centuries, and yet for centuries they&#39;ve been the whipping boys for the entire world around them. It&#39;s f**king heartbreaking, and I&#39;m not even Jewish.</p>

<p>Have you even heard of operation paperclip? If you haven&#39;t we can&#39;t even have a logical discussion about the holocaust because you&#39;re clearly missing out on so many facts.</p>

<p>And more about how far back it goes.. Yes the Holocaust didn&#39;t start in the 1900&#39;s. Like I mentioned about your 1913 comment, it goes way further back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The IBM article is mindblowingly irrelevant. It addresses precisely zero of the points I brought up. From a business ethics standpoint it&#39;s certainly questionable, but even Black never quite concludes that it was much more than a company cashing in on a lucrative sales contract with a dubious customer, and history is littered with incidents like that.</p>

<p>I have indeed heard of Operation Paperclip. I actually wrote a paper in undergrad on the general topic of the heated US-USSR competition to acquire Germany&#39;s top scientists. I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s relevant to the freaking Holocaust, other than that we white-washed the occasional war crime in pursuit of post-war scientific prowess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure not much of this is worth your time.</p>

<p>How is the IBM article irrelevant when it clearly addresses your presumptions about the so called lack of efficiency of the Holocaust?</p>

<p>Thomas Watson not only wanted to cash in, he wanted to make sure the Reich succeeded with his expertise. HE MADE IT AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE to process the Jewish people! The hollerith machines would NOT WORK without American involvement! </p>

<p>Also if you read the article, which you won&#39;t because right now, speaking of HOLOCAUST DENIAL,  you&#39;re in your own denial phase. You&#39;d see that it&#39;s not about holocaust denial, just denial of the official story.  The article cites numerous reports and has a lot of credible information, which makes your rejecting to read it force your credibility to become questionable. </p>

<p>The holocaust was also so important in the development of the independent Israel state. </p>

<p>IBM was also big in the South American Apartheid, so you can see examples of the same type of efficiency. </p>

<p>...to start with.</p>

<p>The Zionists were VERY complicit in acting with the Nazis in the &quot;destruction of their own race.&quot; </p>

<p>The Zionists found common cause with Hitler, Eichmann, and the Nazis and used anti-Semitism and Nazism as a means of achieving their end which was the establishment of a Jewish state. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking twisted as hell, but documented in history. Many Jews profited immensely from the &quot;holocaust&quot; and continue to profit to this very day.</p>

<p>This is a more sensible explanation. The victims of the Holocaust were victimized by their own leaders, and, as you point out, used Hitler as a tool. Whic makes the Holocaust that much <em>more</em> sinister.</p>

<p>I get this all the time, too. People don&#39;t like to have their Illusions shattered. It is as though you have attacked <em>them</em>, personally. So, when I encounter a person like this, I simply confine verbal communication to the weather.</p>

An ex-marine is stating there are here to do the job that our US military may not want to do: unarm and kill US citizens.
