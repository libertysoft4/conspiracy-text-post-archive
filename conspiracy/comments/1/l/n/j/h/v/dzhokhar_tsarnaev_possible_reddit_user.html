        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I began searching last night for Reddit usernames that resembled Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs twitter username. I found one that struck me as peculiar. I&#39;m not sure how to link the username, but it&#39;s simply &quot;tsar&quot; if you&#39;d like to search. The account was created 4 years ago, and the last comment made was 3 years ago. That user had posted a link in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It dealt with an event that the user believed was a false flag event and involved a patsy/mole. Weird, right? Well, I was hoping the comments the user had made would point out where in the world the user lived. Another user, nasamoon, had posted a question (I believe in <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a>) asking what romantic/fun things there were to do in BOSTON. It gets better. &quot;Tsar&quot; had commented on that with a link to a Harvard Museum. Location: Cambridge, Massachusetts. Alright, so a user named &#39;tsar&#39;, lives in or near Cambridge, and is into conspiracy.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just looking too far into it? Thoughts, please!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t say it&#39;s impossible, but what does this bring to the table? We already know he was interested in conspiracy related materials. The false flag/patsy theory is very common. Even if it is him, I doubt there is any real foreshadowing. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9wz12/i_am_a_23_year_old_agnostic_and_i_am_am_afraid_of/c0eufgs">This</a> post is quite interesting though, given the context. </p>

<p>I never really looked in on his twitter account, so I can&#39;t really compare. </p>

<p>If this is him, what I see in his writings is a supple mind, ready to be molded. He warns of patsies, yet he was a ripe target for being turned into one. If this is him, I could see him pulling off the boston bombings. The key question to ask then is &quot;who molded him?&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that is true, some of his tweets suggest that although he was a playful type of guy.. he could be serious, also. He wrote on that school project website about the Memphis Three and was very formal. Maybe he had a serious side when it came to things important to him?</p>

<p>Edit: Also, the guy was smart. He got into an amazing school in Mass. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if that actually was his Reddit account to just.. unload on things that bothered him (like the government).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ye sure, but whats the conspiracy? All I got from this guy was that he found something amazing, a 17 y/o kid commented on a social media site about eating dinner where he lives, in Boston.
How is this content worthy related to conspiracy theory? Whats the motive? Whats the conspiracy? I do question everything, thanks for that, and thats why I responded to this post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But this, don&#39;t question this.. right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what? question what? That a kid was on the internet? Before he was recruited by the CIA or what?</p>

<p>I love how downvoted I get, I wish there were age requirement to even connect to the internet, not saying I deserve upvotes or that it matters, but man, bandwagon effect+15 y/o kids is annoying, putting time limit on comments n shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know its silly, I dont care about the upvote/downvote but when it gets to the point that you have 9 min delay like a new account and for a comment that I dont think was wrong at all, its rather annoying, but yea!</p>

<p>Hum, okay. I guess im not interested in all in what kind of person he is. He is who he is cause of an random chain of events that occured, how he reacted to these events kinda forms and shapes who he is today, like if you visualize a cup being filled drop by drop where the drips are experiences or events, and the cup is you reacting to it or forming/shaping/filling an feeling of something, in this case, hate towards the government.</p>

<p>Maybe he got harrassed for looking different all life, or having various religious beliefs, maybe few months later he got searched at the airport and he&#39;s getting angry and every other event, related or unrelated. It will fill the &quot;hate&quot; into the cup and years and years and years later, he&#39;s a reflection of his enviroment and experiences. My analogy of it was silly, I agree.</p>

<p>So really, who he was isnt that relevant cause if you swapped lifes with him at birth, you would be the boston bomber and he would be sitting here today commenting on it(look into blank slate). So thats why I thought this post was.. dumb, almost, to be honest. I didn&#39;t think of it in this way or perspective, atleast not in a conspiracy way.</p>

<p>My bad then.</p>
