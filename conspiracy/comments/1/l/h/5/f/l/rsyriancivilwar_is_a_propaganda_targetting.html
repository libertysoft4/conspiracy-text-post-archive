<p>see what it looks like now:</p>

<p>edit: keeping proof because i caught them undeleting stuff for defense... </p>

<p>In the past mods refused to put up the Israel flag in their <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/syriantestsyrian/comments/1h4o7j/preferable_header_design/">banner</a> (they had bombarded Syria at that point), they hosted AMA with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/1kylu5/is_there_any_reason_why_this_sub_gave_a_platform/">zionist neocons</a> (without disclosing who mr weiss reallly was), they try to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1kz5vs/us_readies_possible_missile_strike_against_syria/cbuerwj">please</a> JIDF, and now... they ask credulous people their money to assist the FSA, and they have the balls to call themselves neutral.</p>

<p>note: for reference the report i mentionned in the initial message is here: <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/ar/MSF%202010%20Annual%20Report.Final.pdf">http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/ar/MSF%202010%20Annual%20Report.Final.pdf</a></p>

<p>edit: one of the mod has actually joined us here in the thread to defend himself... </p>

<p>edit: ladies and gentleman, the plot thickens... it appears one of the mods of <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a> is BipolarBear0, apparently infamous for being involved in a potential scam with the <a href="/r/restorethefourth">/r/restorethefourth</a> subbredit (reminder <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1hcaxx/warning_there_is_a_very_high_probability_that/">here</a> and <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1lenw6/rtcom_partially_banned_by_reddit_rt_answers_back/cbyk1f3">here</a>), coincidentally, he is also one of the mods of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, the sub that banned RT. Thanks to CowzGoesMooz for the hints, and more proofs of censorship in <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a>... Here be our friend calling him out on his <a href="http://i.imgur.com/i1VhqAc.png">scam</a>, and here be glorious <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Cw3SHX2.png">act</a> of censorship. </p>

<p>edit: aaaaaand he&#39;s <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8UiP8d6.png">banned</a>, sorry i missed the question he asked.</p>

<p>edit: while we&#39;re at it, <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/donations/?o=421340&amp;WT.mc_n=syria">here</a> is the website for red cross donations.</p>

<p>edit: good sunday everyone, it appears another glorious act of censorship has appeared... this time skysdalimit420 is on the receiving end for expressing <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jHSv2sg.png">valid</a> concerns in a rather civil fashion. TBF he was standing at +7 in a stickied post, it was bound to be censored. In other news, their fundraising stands at $40.92.</p>

<p>edit: they <a href="http://imgur.com/HpdoclL">unstickied</a> the fundraising hehe, helping the people my ass.</p>

<p>edit final observation: i got censored in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... <a href="http://i.imgur.com/J9qXkfx.png">This</a> comment in another currently rising <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1li517/i_am_a_syrian_living_in_syria_amamy_bs_detector/">thread</a> relevant to propaganda targetting redditors (the bullshit AMA of yesterday) on the Syrian war was deleted.</p>

<p>edit: just a centralization update, someone in here is definitely not interested in me tying the <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> scam to the <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a> scam, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AsDR5xO.png">here</a> is another act of censorship preventing it in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ljqlw/fake_syrian_tries_to_gain_american_support/">this</a> thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sub used to be awesome and used to be my favorite sub. It used to be either neutral or pro-Assad, since then, it has been flooded by shills, sock puppets and trolls, who have become ragingly anti-Assad and provide no evidence for their arguments. It has been flooded with blatant propaganda, and the anti-Assad creator of the sub does nothing about it. I also got kicked from the IRC chat by bipolarbear for pointing out that Zionists are behind this entire mess. He replied with &quot;oh, dear&quot; and kicked me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The environment at <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a> is already toxic and UDP/bipolarbear are doing nothing to fight the biased air or sock puppets and neither are you. That whole sub has turned into a baseless, anti-Assad circlejerk and UDP has shown his true colors. Don&#39;t pretend for one second that I was the only one turning that sub &quot;toxic&quot;, you shameless sack of shit. More than half of that sub &quot;knows&quot; Assad did it, even without any actual proof and it was turning into a baseless, conspiracy circlejerk where useful information was being purposely downvoted or hidden. Also, I&#39;d tried being logical in the chat and retards like Waffleguna and some random &quot;snoo&quot; began harassing people who wouldn&#39;t believe the baseless &quot;Maher Assad did it&quot; conspiracy. That is what <a href="/r/SCW">/r/SCW</a> has become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will still use <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a> for breaking news but until mods like bipolarbear are stripped of their mod power and all the retarded sock-puppets are banned, I am just going to help keep up a toxic atmosphere and as things get worse, make my own shill accounts to help in that endeavor. <a href="/r/SCW">/r/SCW</a> is not what it was two or three months ago, it&#39;s just another probama, anti-Assad, western propaganda wing of &quot;Maher did it&quot; and &quot;come on guys, do we really need proof that Assad did or didn&#39;t do it before we attack?!&quot;. uptodateprontos biggest mistake was advertising the sub on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. Was he even aware of what went on there, or was his non-neutral, FSA loving ass just trying to get more, uninformed anti Assadists on that sub? I am going to go with the second suggestion.</p>

<p>You should do your part in helping to clean up the sub instead of accusing people of being &quot;toxic&quot;. You&#39;re way more toxic than I am and you&#39;re doing nothing to fight it. You&#39;re still a shameless sack of shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MSF is financed by goldmans sachs, wells fargo, citi group, bain capital, and many more, they say so themselves in their official reports. Their declarations on the gas attacks should be considered sided, and so should this fundraising. If you want to help the syrians, try the Red Cross which entered the country legally, not undercover MSF assisting one side of the equation over the other. tl;dr: don&#39;t throw your money at people you don&#39;t know, even if biased mods sticky the demand </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of pro-regime people on the sub, what there aren&#39;t are conspiracy theorist who blame all the world&#39;s problems on Israel.  That sub isn&#39;t friendly to conspiracy theorist because it involves deep, contextual discussion of complex events.  Too many folks here only know what Alex Jones told them about Syria and for those of us who actually follow and discuss the conflict, stuff like &quot;TEH ZIONIST DID IT&quot; adds absolutely nothing to the conversation.</p>

<p>Again, even a cursory look at the sub will show many pro-regime or anti-FSA users that are still allowed to post.  The term &quot;terrorist&quot; is probably used more often than &quot;rebels&quot; in fact.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t censor for views, we delete things when rules are broken. We allow news outlets and views from all sides, including RT which is banned on other subs and we even de-spam sources that Reddit automatically flags site-wide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>mods need to always take the high road</strong>- with great power comes great responsibility, so keep emotions and personal opinions out of the equation as much as possible.</p>

<p>now- when acting as a redditor in threads<strong>(even threads in subreddits that you mod</strong>), you should have EVERY RIGHT to defend your opinions, and even get as emotional as you want. the point is to seperate the two. </p>

<p>a mod, politician, a cop, a doctor- all of these people shout be just as free to get in screaming matches and fistfights if they damn well want to. but... when in cop mode, when voting for a bill, in doctor mode- <strong>you have to be ambivalent and courteous</strong>. no excuses. </p>

<p>as soon as you stray from this- you lose yourself as well as your audience. everyone is watching.</p>

<p><strong>these are universal truths.</strong></p>
