<p><strong>1942</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the height of World War II, eight brand-new airplanes, two B-17 Flying Fortresses and six P-38 Lightnings--were flying to Iceland, headed for the war in Europe. On July 15, 1942, due to deteriorating weather conditions, the pilots were forced to ditch their warplanes in a never-before-attempted landing on Greenland&#39;s frozen icecap. After eight dangerous but successful landings and a harrowing rescue of the crew across the ice, the warplanes were abandoned to the whims of Greenland&#39;s weather.</p>

<p>For the next 40 years, aviators and adventurers dreamed of recovering the eight planes, dubbed the &quot;Lost Squadron.&quot; </p>

<p>The intrepid airplane hunters computed, based on the depth of the upper ice lenses in Greenland, that 40 years of ice accumulation would have buried the planes to about 40 feet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>1988</strong></p>

<p>Utilizing subsurface radar, the team finally located the planes on July 2, 1988.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their readings had suggested that the aircraft could be under several hundred feet of snow and ice--far more than had been anticipated. </p>

<p>There was no doubt that the planes of the Lost Squadron had been found. And, to the initial dismay of the hunters, the planes were fully 268 feet below the surface! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The planes had been buried under nearly 30 stories of ice in less than fifty years.</p>

<p>While all this is amazing in and of itself, it becomes far more interesting in what it tells us about the science of polar ice sheet formation. The rapidity of the process now becomes far more evident than our best science had predicted.</p>

<p>Originally, a few decades back we went from millions of years to the now accepted, 250,000 of years of ice sheet formation time. However, that amount of time is still very much at odds with the eye-witnesses of human history. Greenland specifically is a good example, recent aerial photos from the 1930&#39;s indicate that the ice retreat was at same level as it is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/02/1930s_greenland_glacier_retreat/" title="But nobody thought it was a big deal">today</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/rediscovered-photos-reveal-greenland-s-glacier-history-1.10725" title="Abrupt Climate Change is real">Rediscovered photos reveal Greenland&#39;s glacier history: Ice retreat was as drastic in the 1930s as it is today.</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Most studies of Greenland&#39;s glaciers have been done only since imaging satellites became available in the 1970s, so the data are relatively short-term. But using photographs from 1930s aerial surveys of the southeast coast of Greenland, together with US military aerial shots from the Second World War and recent satellite images, Bjørk and his colleagues have been able to observe changes at high spatial resolution from a period in which few glacier measurements were previously available.</p>

<p>Analysis of the images reveals that over the past decade, glacier retreat was as vigorous as in a similar period of warming in the 1930s. However, whereas glaciers that spill into the ocean retreated rapidly in the 2000s, it was land-terminating glaciers that underwent the fastest regression 80 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does all this mean? Well, it has nothing to do with the anthropogenic climate change bollocks. </p>

<p><code>(Also, it helps to keep in mind that ice sheets grow and constantly calve around their edges into the surrounding sea; this is a variable but natural process.)</code></p>

<p>What this information means is that our climate is dynamic; and that rather obvious conclusion flies in the face of established science, which more often than not, tells us that such changes are generally gradual and take thousands or millions of years. It also shows mankind&#39;s constant state of amnesia about the natural world he lives in, even when the photographic evidence in the span of a human life time is staring him in the face.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to rethink how long it takes for 10,000 feet of ice to form and also how long it takes to melt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ice core studies from GISP, Camp David, Vostok and all others, rely on the paradigm of one layer equals one year. All isotopic and chemical analysis assumes this fundamental delineation. </p>

<h2>The revealing quote comes from expedition organiser “Richard Epps”. He puzzlingly remarked, <em>“Who told you one layer equals one year? We dug down through fifty years of time and found thousands of layers in 250 feet.”</em></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>And that above quote is very meaningful.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Piri Reis and Oronteus Finaeus Maps derived from far older sources but published almost three hundred years before the &quot;official&quot; discovery of Antarctica in the 1773:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.birinciblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/piri_reis_dunya_haritasi1.jpg" title="Piri Reis">Piri Reis Map of 1513</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.exohuman.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/oronteus_finaeus.jpg" title="A good depiction of Antartica">Oronteus Finaeus Map of 1531</a></p>

<p>If you check out the usual debunk attempts, this <a href="http://ancientaliensdebunked.com/the-piri-reis-map/" title="Aliens? No, disinfo!">particular one</a> provoked by the ridiculous Ancient Alien &quot;Documentary&quot; debacle. The debunkers show this image as evidence that the Piris Reis Map, &quot;wasn’t all that good, especially if they were supposed to have satellite technology or whatever.&quot; It then attempts to illustrate this point by using this <a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/Graphics-Other/PSCI/PiriReis4.gif" title="GPS? Who said that? Disinfo?">graphic</a>.</p>

<p>Curiously, the debunkers seem to forget that the sea levels were drastically lower 12 to 18 thousand years ago. Coast lines extended miles further than they presently do. Take a look:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/pictures/GLOBALsealevelsm.jpg" title="NOAA and Noah">NOAA model of global elevations during the peak of the last ice age</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The map appears to be based on an <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_mapas/pirireis04.gif" title="Charles Hapgood">equidistant projection</a> centered in Eqypt.</p>

<p><a href="http://indocropcircles.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/piri-reis-map-2.jpg" title="Yes, History Channel, but very curious">A reasonable image of the Piris Reis map and a modern map superimposed.</a></p>

<p>Establishment has always taken an opposing stance against any suggestion of abrupt climate changes, here are three great examples of ideas that were vigorously and vehemently opposed until the sheer weight of evidence caused a paradigm shift in thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift#Rejection_of_Wegener.27s_theory.2C_and_subsequent_vindication" title="The idea was moonshine, I was informed">Continental Drift proposed by Alfred Wegener, et al.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Harlen_Bretz#Outrageous_hypothesis" title="&quot;Ideas without precedent are generally looked upon with disfavour and men are shocked if their conceptions of an orderly world are challenged.&quot;">The Origin of the Channeled Scablands proposed by J Harlen Bretz in 1949</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_deluge_theory#Criticism" title="While some geologists claim it as fact that the sequence of events described did occur, there is debate over their suddenness and magnitude.">Black Sea deluge hypothesis</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>A recent example of similar struggles can be seen in the very bitter treatment of the Clovis Impact Hypothesis, also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis" title="Wiki not best source">Younger Dryas impact hypothesis</a>.</p>

<p>The bottom line? </p>

<p>Contrary to the dogmatic orthodoxy of conventional science, the Earth&#39;s global climate can change, and has changed, abruptly; this happens far more frequently than what is considered to be conventionally &quot;acceptable&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The debate about global warming is framed completely wrong.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether global warming exists or not. Why? Because if it exists, we need to find clean energy. And if it doesn&#39;t exist? We still need to find clean energy.</p>

<p>But what about all the people demanding an international carbon tax? Again, if global warming exists, a global tax won&#39;t help. And if global warming doesn&#39;t exist, a global tax won&#39;t help.</p>

<p>So regardless of whether or not global warming exists, we still need renewable clean energy and we don&#39;t need a global carbon tax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem with your first source-- Robert Balling took hundreds of thousands of dollars in research funding from coal companies. Not exactly the sort who&#39;s going to offer an unbiased perspective on climate science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So universities and scientists who support AGW and receive large research grants and subsidies are completely divorced from the possibility of having any impure motivations? </p>

<p>It&#39;s only the scientists who don&#39;t receive government subsidies that are suspect?</p>

<p>Can&#39;t science be debated no matter what, regardless of who funds it? </p>

<p>If the science is flawed then that will come out eventually through the process of honest debate, but as soon as people start shutting other people down and dismissing any discussion, there can be no scientific process -only an echo chamber.</p>

<p>Trust, but verify. As soon as we start blocking the opinion of those with whom we disagree, we are going down a path that stifles advancement.</p>

<p>Additionally, Climatologist Robert Balling was a contributing editor to the article, but it&#39;s a pretty straight forward account of the events and asks some pretty obvious and reasonable questions.</p>

<p>As I point out in a another post, AGW supporters often seem to be incapable of any curiosity about things that don&#39;t fit their paradigm. </p>

<p>For example, the 5200 year old glacier in the Peruvian Andes is getting a lot of attention.  It&#39;s getting attention because the glacier is retreating; but considering that the glacier formed over a tropical area 5200 years ago, it seems rather obvious that the climate has been much warmer in the past.</p>

<p>The same way with sections of Antarctica ice sheets breaking off, we always hear the warmist alarm every year, but it&#39;s simply a natural process of what happens when ice forms and slowly spreads  to the edges where it eventually shears off. </p>

<p>When ice sheets stop breaking off that will be one sure sign the ice cap has stopped growing. It&#39;s the same principle of over filling a cup of water, the water will flow over the edge of the cup until you turn off the faucet.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not really very well informed about the Antarctic ice sheet are you? The problem isn&#39;t that ice sheets calve, the problem is that they&#39;re steadily shrinking. </p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m not sceptical about climate change at all. Climate&#39;s always changed. They always have, and they always will, and that&#39;s in many ways the purpose of the book that if you ignore history you come up with a conclusion which just doesn&#39;t fit in with the evidence, and that is that we&#39;re suddenly in a period where climates change. We&#39;re not. Climates always change, they change much quicker and much greater than anything we measure today.</p>

<p>There are local climate changes that humans influence, and that&#39;s mainly from land clearing. So we see the retreat of the ice on Mount Kilimanjaro is from land clearing; a minor extinction of a frog in Central America is from land clearing. But in terms of global climates, no, climates have always changed, they&#39;ve never been driven by carbon dioxide in the past, they&#39;ve been driven by much, much greater forces.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what he linked me when I asked for his sources, he also linked me:</p>

<p><a href="http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/originals/acid_test.html">http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/originals/acid_test.html</a> </p>

<p>Saying ocean acidification isn&#39;t real either. He literally linked two petrol funded lobby groups/organizations that spread disinformation concerning climate science.</p>

<ul>
<li>SPPI is in the same building as CSPP which surprise is funded by ExxonMobil</li>
<li>SPPI says they are non-profit but, are not registered as one, they are privately funded and do not disclose who funds them.</li>
<li>SPPI has links to ALEC: ALEC is a corporate bill mill. It is not just a lobby or a front group; it is much more powerful than that. Through ALEC, corporations hand state legislators their wishlists to benefit their bottom line. Corporations fund almost all of ALEC&#39;s operations. They pay for a seat on ALEC task forces where corporate lobbyists and special interest reps vote with elected officials to approve “model” bills.</li>
</ul>

<p>After showing him how his sources are funded by ExxonMobil and Kochbrothers he proceeded to tell me: &quot;So what?&quot; and basically said that all scientists that say otherwise are funded by research grants thus making them biased and wrong. While research money is always grubbed for my University researchers, he doesn&#39;t make peer reviewed science wrong. The OP then had to resort to assuming I support carbon credits and love Gore, which i don&#39;t lol.... The guy is either really warped by petrol propaganda or is straight working for them, ever wonder why this is one of the first reddit posts to get stickied? Cause I sure did... Oh best part is he got mad and went through and downvoted everyone of my posts my precious karma what will i do!</p>

<p>You then message me when the &quot;stickie&quot; is taken down:</p>

<p>Well, I never asked for a &quot;stickie&quot; of my post, but considering it was stickied for the better part of the weekend, i can&#39;t complain. Did you think it was going to be permanent, were you really scared?</p>

<p>I have no stomach for consensus as a means for uncovering truths, Michael Crichton spelled the reason out very well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you’re being had.</em></p>

<p><em>Let’s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What are relevant are reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it&#39;s science, it isn&#39;t consensus. Period.</em></p>

<p>Science isn&#39;t infallible because man isn&#39;t infallible, but the scientific method is pretty cut and dry. Listen to what you just said. You don&#39;t support consensus as a mean for uncovering truths... So you don&#39;t support one scientist doing an experiment posting his findings to be peer reviewed and REPEATED by his peers. If his experiments can be repeated and the same data comes out its usually pretty solid evidence that the findings have some basis in reality. Does it make it the word of God? Nope.  Not everyone is going to agree on everything because what in this world does everyone agree on? But in the words of Neil deGrasse Tyson:</p>

<p>“The good thing about science is that it&#39;s true whether or not you believe in it.”</p>

<p>The only thing I have a personal vendetta about is public disinformation, which you support through your ignorance, the science of the matter is unbiased as human thought can be at the moment, and like I said before, I&#39;ll take crowd-funded science over your petrol funded lobby spew, that has not been accepted by any worldwide climate panel as being actual science.</p>

<p>BTW Michael Crichton&#39;s conclusions have been disputed with new data from research stations:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this sounds like the planes got buried under a mountain of snow, like sand shifting in the desert.  just because the sand piles up in one place doesn&#39;t mean the whole dessert is gaining sand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The climatologists addressed that, they took note of the position of the &quot;lense&quot;. (lenses are sheets of ice that form part of the layered sequence of snow and ice found in glaciers). Additionally, say there was a magical place where 30 stories of ice could build up in such short times, that is how ice sheets/glaciers form. The mass builds up until it spreads.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010411040505/http://weatherwise.org/00nd.cerveny.html">
From linked article:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s possible that the massive accumulation of snow and ice above the eight warplanes was merely local; there may have been melting elsewhere on the huge ice sheet. A large accumulation of snow and ice over a 50-year period in one location doesn&#39;t necessarily say much about the overall state of the ice sheet.</p>

<p>However, the scientific literature of the 1990s provides some surprising information. For example, in 1991, German scientist Philippe Huybrechts found that a 1 degrees C warming would actually increase the snow and ice mass of Greenland, due to increased snowfall. Another scientist, Roger Braithwaite from the Greenland Geological Survey in Denmark, published an article entitled &quot;Is the Greenland Ice Sheet Getting Thicker?&quot; in which he concluded that the issue is very complex and that no simple answer could be defended at that time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also consider that friction from the huge mass is constantly supplying melt water which flows beneath the huge thicknesses of ice.</p>

<p>In the center of Antarctica there are rivers of melt water flowing in ancient beds far beneath 1.5 miles of ice. Additionally, one can not entirely ignore geothermal influences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is mildly like how trees that were planted 8 years ago can have rings double their age or even less than their age. Due to growing season weather.  Direct linear correlation to the past is not a good scientific method. Generalities are all that any such method can infer from the evidence given. There is no way to determine the age of things beyond historical references. Nor how things will progress past a very short time window. There is just too much variation. Even carbon and radiometric dating can be off due to solar activity, gravitational anomalies and several other issues. If extra ozone falls in the rain on items with radioisotopes it can drastically change the half life. Even heavy isotopes can be drastically changed with volcanic/magnetic/gravitation/solar et. al., changes. Often even carbon dating is off merely because the geological layer that an item is found (a theory never given validity in itself through verifiable data) in once determined narrows the acceptable ranges of data that is returned. Meaning out of range date returns are simply automatically considered anomalies and rejected. But i digress.... neat. Watched the documentary on this a few years ago. Worth investigating the whole idea of geological age theories.</p>

<p>BTW, spot-on with global warming IMHO. Weather is cyclical...and even though weather where I grew up is FAR different than it was when I was a kid nearly 50 years ago it HAS changed. There are SO many factors governing weather patterns that there&#39;s no way we can be sure about this whole subject until a few hundred more years of records are kept...and I sincerely doubt that civilization, as we know it, will exist then.</p>

I can&#39;t find any references to if other planes were recovered. It was a very expensive undertaking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you get a P‑38 out of the ice? Simple...melt the ice! Well, maybe not as simple as that, seeing how it was 268 feet of ice. Basically, you start with a six-digit budget, followed by transporting tons of equipment that include arctic survival gear and heavy construction machinery, and top it all off with adventure-minded individuals willing to take the hardships and risks associated with one-of-a-kind expeditions to a hostile environment. That&#39;s what it took to recover a P-38 from &quot;The Lost Squadron.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is, is this actually technically &quot;suppressed&quot;? You have to take into account the circlejerk of academia. The scientific community often cares just as much about ego as they do progress. Maybe the &quot;suppression&quot; of this information is due to the social/egotistical side of science, where the people that are successfully funded are the people that stick to the accepted paradigm? I know quite a few scientists and professors that have been given inadequate funding just because their study has the potential to shake up what is written in textbooks and discussed at conferences.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know for sure that this is the case, but I think its an important part of the discussion.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> I know that the above is still technically suppression, but its &quot;accidental&quot; suppression versus deliberately carried out misdirection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, it&#39;s not necessarily a planned conspiracy of suppression but more of an innate human failing that one can find prevalent throughout history. </p>

<p>Arrogance and over confidence blinding the majority of people into flawed paradigms which eventually lead to destruction. Destruction often coming not from the things they feared, but from the things they never even considered to be worthy of their fear or concern.</p>

<p>I think &quot;natural conspiracies&quot; are far more common and dangerous to human civilization. Power structures metastasize in naturally occurring patterns; we see this in religious, scientific and political bodies. They have a tendency to sedimentate and ossify, becoming an end to themselves and no longer fulfilling their intended purpose. Echo chambers representing a void of human growth and understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Antarctica, even when covered in ice is a huge strategic position attractive to many nations. This fact prompted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System" title="politics">Antarctic Treaty System</a> finalized in 1961.</p>

<p>Being a political cynic, I am sure it&#39;s been violated quite often since its inception.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Article 1 – The area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited but military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 2 – Freedom of scientific investigations and cooperation shall continue;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 3 – Free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the United Nations and other international agencies;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 4 – The treaty does not recognize, dispute, nor establish territorial sovereignty claims; no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 5 – The treaty prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 6 – Includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves but not the surrounding waters south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 7 – Treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must be given;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 8 – Allows for good jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 9 – Frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 10 – All treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;</p></li>
<li><p>Article 11 – All disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately, by the International Court of Justice;</p></li>
<li><p>Articles 12, 13, 14 – Deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As far as how the ice sheets formed, there&#39;s a variety of theories, some of them suggesting that the ice sheets were not always in their present positions. For me, considering that such ice sheets may form and dissipate fairly rapidly due to some currently unknown mechanism; I think it indicates some scary possibilities. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_shift_hypothesis">Pole shift hypothesis</a> has now been generally considered to be invalidated because mainstream scientists say that while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_polar_wander">polar wander</a> occurs, it happens over very lengthy periods of time: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While there are reputable studies showing that true polar wander has occurred at various times in the past, the rates are much smaller (1° per million years or slower) than predicted by the pole shift hypothesis (up to 1° per thousand years).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/pole-dancing-earths-dramatic-polar-shifts-explained/" title="Conventional science">Pole dancing: Earth’s polar shifts explained</a></p>

<p>Curiously, popular science accepts that Antarctica has been much <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120617170307.htm" title="pleasant">warmer</a> in the past; albeit millions of years ago according to their sediment core dating analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The peak of this Antarctic greening occurred during the middle Miocene period, between 16.4 and 15.7 million years ago. This was well after the age of the dinosaurs, which became extinct 64 million years ago. During the Miocene epoch, mostly modern-looking animals roamed Earth, such as three-toed horses, deer, camel and various species of apes. Modern humans did not appear until 200,000 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080728111358.htm" title="dating correct?">Snapshot Of Past Climate Reveals No Ice In Antarctica Millions Of Years Ago</a></p>

<p>But, we also know that pole shift, albeit small, can be impacted by forces like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile in February 2010 shifted Earth’s axis by 7.6 centimeters and shortened the length of the day by 1.26 millionths of a second.</p></li>
<li><p>The 9.1 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra on December 2004 shifted Earth’s axis by 7.0 centimeters and shortened the length of the day by 6.8 millionths of a second.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://earthsky.org/earth/march-11-japan-earthquake-powerful-enough-to-shift-earths-axis" title="slow and steady">The 8.9-magnitude earthquake in Japan on March 11, 2011 might have shifted Earth’s axis by some 8 to 10 centimeters.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>More information here: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/03/100302-chile-earthquake-earth-axis-shortened-day/" title="NG">Chile Earthquake Altered Earth Axis, Shortened Day: Earthquake sped Earth&#39;s spin, figure skater style.</a></p>

<p>An interesting blog article on <a href="http://sureshemre.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/past-and-future-pole-shifts/">Past and Future Pole Shifts</a>.</p>

<p>So, it always comes down to if the current science is correct: gradual change versus abrupt change. A lot depends on the dating methods and accuracy. I&#39;m convinced that scientific knowledge of polar ice and glacier formations are in a state of flux and very misguided because much of what we know is very reliant on dating of ice layers and sediments. Additionally, the detailed causes of Earth&#39;s past Ice Ages even now are not well understood.</p>

<p>There are also ice caps atop mountains in Africa and South America, in addition to the Greenland ice sheet. For purposes of storing the world&#39;s water, all have some relevance. Additionally, the manner of the mechanism in which they all form, grow and diminish are all relevant to each other.</p>

<p>This is why you will notice I treat them as a general category: ice sheets. Yes, undoubtedly, Antarctica is the largest being located more or less directly at the South Pole and on a landmass, where as Greenland is offset from the North Pole&#39;s ocean location.</p>

<p>To me the time it takes for such massive amounts of ice to accumulate is of huge importance. Peru&#39;s Quelccaya ice cap grew rapidly 5200 years ago as evidenced by the plants left fast frozen beneath it which recent melting has exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen one, but one might be out there.</p>

<p>The NOAA map is a computer model of sea levels approximately 18,000 years ago. Obviously we have no real way to tell how old the &quot;older&quot; source maps used in the Piris Reis Map were; so meshing dates is a problem.</p>

<p>Add to that the distraction of the &quot;Alien-GPS-Technology&quot; mumbo jumbo which makes people presume that the old maps are highly accurate, etc... </p>

<p>Well, I take a measured position: <em>older source maps seems to have been real damn good, but also peculiar in some of the things they portray.</em></p>

<p>Here&#39;s good one from Monash University: <a href="http://sahultime.monash.edu.au/explore.html" title="100k BP to Present">Explore SahulTime</a> You can adjust global sea levels from 100,000 years ago until present by using the slider. </p>

<p>Just remember, as with any modeling system, it&#39;s only as good as the data that&#39;s entered into it. Note the blurb:</p>

<p><code>Caution: Please note that this representation is a reconstruction based on available data and knowledge, which always has an inherent uncertainty. As a visual model SahulTime provides a good first approximation of the Earth&#39;s past, but please contact the SahulTime project for further details and discussion of any aspect shown here.</code></p>

<p>Many of the source maps were covered in the classic book <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mapas_pirireis/esp_mapaspirireis05.htm" title="book information">MAPS OF THE ANCIENT SEA KINGS</a> by Charles Hapgood:</p>

<p>Charles Hapgood performed a detailed analysis of this map. He worked with students from Keene State College, as well as with cartographers from the US Air Force.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a detailed analysis, several interesting observations were made:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>The map appears is composed of at least six separate source maps.</p></li>
<li><p>The map provided remarkably accurate latitude and longitude locations of coastal features of Africa, North and South America, and a portion of Antarctica. (This point is contested by many people and is addressed later in the section on Antarctica).</p></li>
<li><p>The source maps themselves utilize the principles of plane geometry and an ability to account for the curvature of the earths surface.</p></li>
<li><p>The knowledge of longitude suggests either a people, or a mechanism, that are currently unknown to us. (This is because the ability to determine longitude with any degree of accuracy is not known before AD 1700 (?) ).</p></li>
<li><p>The map is based on an <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_mapas/pirireis04.gif" title="From book">equidistant projection</a> with its center on the meridian of <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_mapas/pirireis03.gif">Alexandria in Egypt</a>.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Really good post OP. I admire the way you approach such a hot button issue with a very fair, matter-of-fact approach. This is how we need to have discussions like this. Your post is well thought out, sourced, and isn&#39;t a knee jerk reaction to the climate change industry. </p>

<p>Anything on this magnitude of scale (global) it is impossible to determine what variables are contributing to the phenomenon we are seeing. It is a fact that there is much, much more CO2 in the atmosphere than in recent history. I dare say it&#39;s safe to assume that humans are largely responsible. What exactly is the effect of that? That&#39;s where it gets complicated. Like you said the earth has been going through natural cycles way before the industrial revolution. How can we determine what amount of the climate change is due to humans and what amount is caused by other natural processes. Without being able to experimentally test the hypothesis, it is impossible to separate man made from natural. </p>

<p>One thing that I think should be discussed alongside global climate change is ocean acidification. The huge increase in CO2 is acidifying the ocean water. More CO2 in the water increases the carbonic acid which contributes hydrogen ions which lower the pH. This is likely caused by human CO2 production and is just as big of a problem as climate change, but it is often ignored. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I found your statement mostly agreeable up until the point of CO2 and its proposed role. Geologists in particular point out that CO2 has been far higher in Earth&#39;s history without runaway warming, indeed often in periods of glaciation. Plants love CO2, treating it as a pollutive agent is contrary to basic life science, and a wholly modern construct.</p>

<p>There is also reason to doubt if the analysis of trapped air bubbles in glacial cores can be truly representative of past global CO2 levels.</p>

<p>Setting CO2 aside, we know the Earth has been warmer in the past, much warmer; we also know sea levels have risen and fallen in the past by drastic amounts. Morphing such natural changes into a man-made event that can not truly be reversed serves a dubious purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, my post might not have been clear. I didn&#39;t proof read it that well. That sentence you quoted is referring to ocean acidification. I do think the high levels of CO2 from human activity are causing ocean acidification to happen. I mean, ocean acidification is happening.

<p>I have heard it raised recently as a concern with more frequency, but I admit I am cynical over all because I lived through the era when we were told acid rain was going to destroy all the forests and trees.</p>

<p>I am think that the earth has a system of offsets and a means of balancing out things over periods of time.</p>

<p>The oceans absorb CO2 and traps it in its sediments and sea life (coral reefs plants, etc), iron helps neutralize acidity and the earth is made up of large amounts of iron. Increased acidity can also dissolve calcite deposits which releases trapped CO2 back into the ocean:</p>

<p><a href="http://pmel.noaa.gov/co2/files/pmel-research.003.jpg" title="NOAA">Ocean Carbon Uptake</a></p>

<p>The biggest reason I don&#39;t worry about acidification as being a big issue: it&#39;s never happened before even in earth&#39;s past where CO2 has been much higher than it is at present.</p>

<p>But again, I question the overall demonizing of carbon and CO2; it&#39;s the stuff of life and  is absolutely essential to life on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your cynicism. Unfortunately the loudest and most prevalent voices are the people predicting cataclysm from acid rain, global warming, global climate change etc. I wrote a paper on this recently. It&#39;s unfortunate that politicians have gotten so focused on the science of climate change because everything scientific that politicians start to meddle with turns to shit. The facts of the matter aren&#39;t as thrilling and shocking as what Al Gore would have you believe. Doomsday brings more people to the polls. Acid rain was a real thing. There are statues that have eroded or been otherwise changed because of more acidic rain. Some soils have become more acidic as well. Luckily it has not been extreme enough to cause major problems. Global climate change is the same. </p>

<p>Plants do love CO2 but they are limited in their ability to utilize it. There comes a point where you could increase CO2 all you want but the plant will not become more productive. Most plants are well adapted to current levels of CO2 and the increase in CO2 hasn&#39;t produced an equal increase in plant production. The Calvin cycle has a limit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, as Scientific American points out, ‘acidification’ means a drop in value, anywhere along the scale. So the term ‘ocean acidification’ is misleading. The oceans are not acidifying. They are undergoing a process known as neutralization, but the term ‘acidification’ sounds scarier than talking about the oceans becoming slightly less basic or a little more neutral.
<a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/ocean-acidification-is-a-misnomer/123">
-Ocean Acidification is a Misnomer</a></p>

<p>“OCEAN ACIDIFICATION” – THE EXTREMISTS’ FALLBACK SCARE</p>

<p>First, they called it “global warming”. Then they noticed there had been no warming for 15 years, and cooling for 9, so they hastily renamed it “climate change”. Then they noticed the climate was changing no more than it ever had, so they tried “energy security”, and even named a Congressional Bill after it. Then they noticed that most Western nations already had bountiful energy security, in the form of vast, untapped domestic supplies of oil, gas, coal, or all three, so they switched to “ocean acidification”.</p>

<p>This is the new phantasmagoric for the tired, old scare whipped up by the NRDC and the environmental extremist movement for their own profit at our expense. The world’s corals, they tell us, will be eaten away by the acidified ocean within not more than ten years hence. Shellfish will be no more, their calcified carapaces and exoskeletons dissolved by the carbonic acid caused by our burning of fossil fuels. The oceans will die. Sound familiar?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all relative. What it comes down to is that corals and many other ocean animals (think sea shells of all kinds) use calcium carbonate to build there rigid, hard structures. The lower pH makes it more difficult for organisms to build their calcium carbonate structures and they become brittle. This is happening. There is a lot of data from a wide range of sources measuring local pH levels and the health of corals etc. </p>

<p>Coral reefs throught the ocean are bleaching and dying partly because of temperature change and partly because of acidification. In this case it seems pretty clear: Humans are the cause of the huge increase in CO2 levels recently, increased CO2 causes ocean pH to drop (however slightly), the pH drop is causing measurable changes in corals and other organisms that use calcium carbonate. </p>

<p>SPPI has links to ALEC: ALEC is a corporate bill mill. It is not just a lobby or a front group; it is much more powerful than that. Through ALEC, corporations hand state legislators their wishlists to benefit their bottom line. Corporations fund almost all of ALEC&#39;s operations. They pay for a seat on ALEC task forces where corporate lobbyists and special interest reps vote with elected officials to approve “model” bills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you are right. I can understand why someone would have his position though. There is a lot of bunk information out there, even from those trying to prove climate change. Unfortunately the issue has become a political tool and a tool for money/control. The denial seems to be a push back by those who are cynical about the propaganda or misinformation that some charlatans are pushing to oversell climate change for their own personal gain. Honestly I didn&#39;t check all of the sources he put. I&#39;m very familiar with both sides of the argument so I filled in the blanks without using the sourced material (which is a sin I know, but come on..it&#39;s reddit). I admire that he puts his argument forward and thoroughly explains it. And honestly, I like anyone who is willing to point out that there is dogma in science and it&#39;s ok to challenge it, even if they are wrong.</p>

<p>I study biology now and I&#39;m not sure where it will take me exactly but I hope I will have to chance to go to graduate school and do research. In the same way I get frustrated by dogmatic religious zealots I also get frustrated by science zealots. I love science and it is a passion of mine. That being said, I know it is not infallible. There is always the chance of being wrong and we are very far away from explaining everything to the point where we can look down our nose at people who may disagree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Warning OP has cited known petrol lobbyist. His post is the result of petrol propaganda and should serve as clear evidence of the power of money in politics.</strong></p>

<p>Ian Pilmer: Is the director of seven mining companies, with at least two having coal interests. Mining industries, particularly coal, would be adversely affected if governments enacted climate legislation.</p>

<p>Plimer has written articles for peer-reviewed journals, none of them, however, pertain to climate change. Plimer claims his climate beliefs, which run contrary to climate scientists, are not related to his mining interests, and are based in &quot;pure science.&quot; A deeper investigation into his position shows Plimer&#39;s positions may be as far from pure science as one can get. Let&#39;s take a look at a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Plimer states the rate at which climate change is occurring is no different today than it was a billion years ago -- there is no change in the speed or scope of climate variation. He also claims there is no dangerous warming happening, and that average global temperatures in the 20th Century were not abnormal. This runs contrary to findings of more than a thousand scientists working for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body which shared the Nobel prize in 2007 for their work.</p></li>
<li><p>Plimer asserts that more carbon dioxide is released annually from submerged marine volcanoes than from human activity.  The U.S. Geological Survey has found that human activity produces at least 120 times as much carbon dioxide than volcanoes, annually.</p></li>
<li><p>He wrote How to Get Expelled From School: A guide to climate change for pupils, parents and punters, an anti-Warmist manual for the younger reader. The book, designed to encourage students to challenge climate science, was reviewed by numerous sources and found to be scientifically inaccurate. Within the book, Plimer offers 101 questions for students to ask their teachers about climate science. Plimer&#39;s answers were so grossly misleading that the Australian government published a document to answer his questions and to serve as a reliable resource for students. In the document, the government states: </p></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;<em>Many of the questions and answers in Professor Plimer’s book are misleading and are based on inaccurate or selective interpretation of the science. The answers [in this document] are based on up-to-date peer reviewed science, and have been reviewed by a number of Australian climate scientists</em>.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Plimer has also spoken at the Heartland Institute&#39;s International Conference on Climate Change. Between 1998 and 2010, the co-sponsors of this conference received more than $21 million in funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch brothers.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.exposethebastards.com/who_is_ian_plimer">http://www.exposethebastards.com/who_is_ian_plimer</a></p>

<p>Quoting Danxmason here because it is well said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The debate about global warming is framed completely wrong.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether global warming exists or not. Why? Because if it exists, we need to find clean energy. And if it doesn&#39;t exist? We still need to find clean energy.</p>

<p>But what about all the people demanding an international carbon tax? Again, if global warming exists, a global tax won&#39;t help. And if global warming doesn&#39;t exist, a global tax won&#39;t help.</p>

<p>So regardless of whether or not global warming exists, we still need renewable clean energy and we don&#39;t need a global carbon tax.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget this is not a black and white issue and that, there will be parties seeking profit either way, as is the way of our monetary system. Carbon credits are a perfect example of raw data being used for profit and not actual action (sustainable tech/energy).</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t actually making that argument, some redditors who are AGW adherents chose to pick up the pitchforks because a climatologist who was an editor on the Lost Squadron article happened to be cynical about the AGW modeling and questioned the role of CO2 and glacial layer analysis as a reliable method of measurement.</p>

<p>For the record, my original post is about how the mainstream understanding of ice sheet formation may be incredibly wrong. We are told 10,000+ foot thick ice sheets take at least 250,000 years to form, but observation indicates that may not actually be the case.</p>

<p>Further observations show that rapid changes have occurred in the past that are totally divorced from the AGW model of the climate.</p>

<p>PS. I think it&#39;s more likely we are heading into an ice age, and no, I don&#39;t think humans will be the cause of it. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> really needs to take some environmental classes so it can understand <strong>anthropogenic climate change.</strong> Getting really tired of all these, &quot;<em>global warming</em> is normal&quot; posts.

Simply look at who funds what and you will see the petrol industry doesn&#39;t want us to believe anything is anthropogenic.</p>

<p>This post shouldn&#39;t be stickied. It makes a complex topic seem black and white. Anthropogenic climate change is real, in addition to Earth&#39;s naturally changing climate, (which we don&#39;t understand fully, and have even more trouble understanding it when we alter it in ways we don&#39;t understand completely yet either). We should not be focusing on things like carbon tax and instead should be focusing on things like our entire economic system and sustainability of our civilization as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you skip right over the black and white part I explained? Petrol spends money to say there is zero evidence of anthropogenic climate change, and while there is evidence of human induced climate change, humans are not sole reason for climate change, get out of duality man, this issue is not black and white.</p>

<p>Damn @ you using the term &quot;warmists&quot; you seem really educated and open to there being a middle ground to the issue. You assume I am defending carbon credits or something, if you took note of my economic system comment you would understand that in a monetary based system that is basically a free for all there are always going to be people gunning for money in whatever way they can, just because someone is making money off of the some evidence doesn&#39;t disprove every conclusion that you can drawn from the raw data. Please stop taking this personal and take step back and view the issue not in black and white. Better yet take a few environmental classes they down play carbon credits as much as you do, you would probably enjoy them, and would find it easier to understand climate change, anthropogenic and not. You seem very adamant about the topic which is good because it is something that could be a giant driving force for economic change, sustainability should be our endgame.</p>

<p>Does this clear anything up for you or are you going to try and label me an alarmist or warmist? I don&#39;t think I am either.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m not sceptical about climate change at all. Climate&#39;s always changed. They always have, and they always will, and that&#39;s in many ways the purpose of the book that if you ignore history you come up with a conclusion which just doesn&#39;t fit in with the evidence, and that is that we&#39;re suddenly in a period where climates change. We&#39;re not. Climates always change, they change much quicker and much greater than anything we measure today.</p>

<p>There are local climate changes that humans influence, and that&#39;s mainly from land clearing. So we see the retreat of the ice on Mount Kilimanjaro is from land clearing; a minor extinction of a frog in Central America is from land clearing. But in terms of global climates, no, climates have always changed, they&#39;ve never been driven by carbon dioxide in the past, they&#39;ve been driven by much, much greater forces.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide has an effect on the atmosphere and it has an effect for the first 50 parts per million and once it&#39;s done its job then it&#39;s finished and you can double it and quadruple it and it has no effect because we&#39;ve seen that in the geological past, and we&#39;ve seen it in times gone by when the carbon dioxide content was 100 times the current content. We didn&#39;t have runaway global warming, we actually had glaciation, so there&#39;s immediately a disconnect. So carbon dioxide is absolutely vital for living on earth; it&#39;s plant food, all of life lives off carbon dioxide. To demonise it shows that you don&#39;t understand school child science.</p>

<p>Oh, I think you&#39;ve just got to follow the money.

It was 50 years ago we had the same sort of institutes looking at nuclear science, we&#39;ve got the same sort of institutes popping up for other great causes and fads.

<p>Yeah, like I said, obviously nobody is making money off the man-made global alarmist movement.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always easier to shut people down and not debate the science by simply alleging that they are crooks.</p>

<p>The problem is that for far too long, skeptics of anthropogenic warming have been accused of being crooks, while the politicians and government subsidized research has been raking in the funds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the curious case of sudden glaciation in the Peruvian Andes of 5200 years before present. It was documented in the frustrating documentary by the National Geographic channel “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDzcpDS2kR0" title="willful ignorance">2012 Countdown to Armageddon</a>”.</p>

<p><a href="http://chiefio.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/quelccaya-peru/" title="Chiefio rocks!">Chiefio</a> does an excellent write-up on the video here and he points out the willful ignorant and cognitive dissonance in the treatment of the facts and conclusions put forth by official dogma:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing to me was that it was still a decent presentation of some nice photography and had interviews with some decent scientists. It did, however, feel compelled to filter everything though the Global Warming PC Filter at the end. But in the middle, there was some decent data presented and some nice insights.</p>

<p>What I found interesting in the presentation was that here they were, staring at a retreating glacier. Right next to a 12 to 18 foot wall of ice. Looking at 5200 year old plant remains, and talking about them having been flash frozen… and they give a wet kiss to “global warming” and “climate change”. All the time standing on the evidence that we’d been warmer than this before (as those plants were flourishing in a field, not under ice) and all that happened is we got suddenly colder.</p>

<p>The show then ended with the obligatory voice over on Climate Change / Global Warming at the end and a very soppy episode of Lonni saying he had “no idea” what was to come but mentioned “abrupt change” and Maloof then mutates the 5200 BP rain induced flooding into an analog with AGW induced sea level rise flooding.</p>

<p>I was astounded to see such “mutilation of the reality” to try to force fit mountain snows and glacier building into a ‘glacier melting and sea level rise’ analogy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5200 years in the Peruvian Andes a glacier formed over plants so rapidly that they were preserved in place:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think about that for a minute. The plants are found ‘in growing positions’ and preserved so that you can see the leaves, stems, and details. They were suddenly “flash frozen” and never thawed. Until now. There are similar things around the world. Ötzi, the Iceman, fell in 5200 BP and was covered in snow. Then held in the freezer until now. And more.  <em>-Chiefio</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2002, he first stumbled across some non-fossilized plants exposed by the steadily retreating Quelccaya ice cap. Carbon dating showed that plant material was at least 5,000 years old.</p>

<p>Then in 2004, Thompson found additional plant beds revealed by the continued retreat of the melting ice and when tested, these proved to be carbon-free, suggesting that they might date back more than 50,000 years. If true, that would suggest that the climate in that region may not have been as warm as it is today in more than 500 centuries.</p>

<p>In June, he went back to the ice field and found at least 20 new plant collection sites that had been newly exposed. An analysis of the plant material from these sites suggested that it ranged from 4,500 to 6,500 years old.</p>

<p>Some of these sites contained thick, multiple layers of plant material and soil which might provide a chronology of when in the past this now high, cold, ice-covered locale harbored flourishing wetland bogs, an ecosystem requiring much warmer temperatures.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think any educated person can deny climate change; it&#39;s been happening continuously throughout earth&#39;s history; this is established just by observing the nature of the geology which surrounds us.</p>

<p>It is anthropogenic global warming  that&#39;s the bone of contention. The warmists slyly morphed &quot;Global Warming&quot; into the all encompassing &quot;Climate Change&quot; in a rather blunt force attempt to retain some legitimacy.</p>

<p>When you can stand near a melting glacier and pick up plants that were flash frozen just 5200 years before; you can&#39;t go harping on about man-made global warming and still retain any shred of intellectual honesty. And, yet, people do; talk about missing the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose one could think that if you ignore the entirety of the earth&#39;s climate history prior to the human industrial period. Peru&#39;s Quelccaya ice cap grew rapidly 5200 years ago as evidenced by the plants left fast frozen beneath it which recent melting has exposed. Plants that lived in a much warmer climate than our current time.</p>

<p>You realize some people call Judith Curry a &quot;denier&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Curry has stated that she is troubled by the &quot;tribal nature&quot; of parts of the climate-science community, and what she sees as stonewalling over the release of data and its analysis for independent review. She has written that climatologists should be more transparent in their dealings with the public and should engage with those skeptical of the scientific consensus on climate change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tribal Nature, I definitely see her point.</p>

<p>I also enjoy Ian Plimer for his staunch views on the history of Earth&#39;s real climate changes as seen from a geologist&#39;s perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I&#39;m not sceptical about climate change at all. Climate&#39;s always changed. They always have, and they always will, and that&#39;s in many ways the purpose of the book that if you ignore history you come up with a conclusion which just doesn&#39;t fit in with the evidence, and that is that we&#39;re suddenly in a period where climates change. We&#39;re not. Climates always change, they change much quicker and much greater than anything we measure today.</p>

<p>There are local climate changes that humans influence, and that&#39;s mainly from land clearing. So we see the retreat of the ice on Mount Kilimanjaro is from land clearing; a minor extinction of a frog in Central America is from land clearing. But in terms of global climates, no, climates have always changed, they&#39;ve never been driven by carbon dioxide in the past, they&#39;ve been driven by much, much greater forces.</p>
