    <div class="md"><p>Uhh, people, you realize that EVERY TIME you post to Reddit you are leaving behind data that can be &quot;mined&quot;--correct?</p>

<p>A few years back I met a guy who actually DID work for a company much like the one described in the oft-reposted composition about being a paid shill for Israel. He didn&#39;t work in a shithole...on the contrary, he worked in a gorgeous office outside of SF and ran very complex, very EXPENSIVE software that allowed one person to take on a huge number of online &quot;personas.&quot; The software would &quot;remember&quot; each persona and it went a step further--it would, much like Microsoft Word&#39;s spelling/grammar check, inform you if you were writing something that was &quot;out of character&quot; by using different-colored &quot;underlines&quot; and text formatting. It would also automatically compile (across websites) what you wrote and could detect contradictions that were within the particular &quot;persona&quot; that you were currently using. Bear in mind this was 2009 and he told me that said software was already a few years old. I can only imagine how powerful this program has gotten now that basically unlimited cloud storage/bandwidth are the norm.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;ve been an xNIX sysadmin my entire life and was utterly FLOORED by what this program could do. Unlike people who do not share my skillset I realized the <em>immense</em> amount of computational horsepower it took to run a DB of this complexity and size--let alone one that allowed hundreds of people to use it at once and cross-compile information. The kicker was when he showed me all of the different reporting features...one report format was so utterly brilliant that it could tell you EVERYTHING about a particular user by studying their comments across years of posts on different sites. It could even &quot;guess,&quot; with 97% accuracy, the author of a particular post by analyzing the word usage, punctuation, grammar, and use of different word modifiers! This information could then be used to grab a &quot;real&quot; name, which then linked to public record databases. Some things it knew about me? My real name, the last four addresses I&#39;ve used, the type of car I drove, where I worked, who I&#39;ve dated, my computer/OS of choice, my SSN, and my sexual orientation. These were just the first few things in a list that was 80+ lines long. It even knew about court cases that I was involved in 20+ years ago.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, I&#39;ve been waiting to bring something like this up so that I <em>could</em> tell you about it for one. This is NOT fictitious software--it actually worked.</p>

<p>My point is this...come on people. This innocuous poll will tell the people who ARE (right now) gathering information about you nothing at all new. OP has a long posting history and while I may not agree with all of his/her opinions I know that they&#39;re not a troll. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve used the Internet for over a year and actually contributed anything at all the damage is already done--regardless of encryption, VPN, virtualization, etc, etc. Trust me.</p>

<p>tl;dr: &quot;They&quot; already know all that they need to know about you and this poll tells &quot;them&quot; nothing new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Name the program. The reason I ask is because I&#39;m not entirely sure I believe you. Your argument is persuasive, and I&#39;m not denying people can be traced via their Internet trail, but you are over-stating things. A person <strong>can</strong> be traced by a forum post, but only if the ISP &amp; Website give up that person&#39;s data, and assuming that that person has taken zero measures to obfuscate his or her identity.</p>

<p>You seem to be saying all counter measures taken to hide a persons real identity are useless. This is clearly not the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, this is not what I&#39;m saying. What I am saying is that UNLESS your Internet time consists of ALWAYS obfuscating your identity then you are probably &quot;tagged&quot; by a system such as this.</p>

<p>The program did not have a name--not one that was relayed to me anyhow. It was an acronym, all caps, ran under some type of xNIX. I believe that it was semi-proprietary as this &quot;firm&quot; was a branch of another firm that you HAVE heard about recently (not Booz though).</p>

<p>I wish that I could be more specific but I saw it for 10 minutes and was NOT encouraged to ask questions. It does exist though and I was told that it was modular and used Oracle somewhere in the back end. The report generator was semi (if not totally) proprietary though. I want to say it was called Sage but only about 50% sure of that. It was a while ago.</p>

<p>If you Google this type of thing you will see similar programs. I&#39;m sure that somebody in this SR can help with a name...if one exists. I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ve read about this type of program on this SR at one time or another also.</p>

<p>It was something like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks">this</a> but for commercial use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the purpose of this survey?  The questions are terrible and the list of potential AMA candidates is horrid.  The moderators of this subreddit need to constantly be scrutinized in their decisions in my opinion.  Especially after the direction Reddit has been taking lately and the new Wikileaks concerning one of the founders and Stratfor.  Long live transparency and peace.  This survey seems dumb judging from the questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None really.  The AMA one was interesting but your conglomeration of mainstream established conspiracy theory personalities and figures left out the more interesting and more credible whistle blowers and researchers in my opinion.  How about an AMA with Senator Mark Dayton who resigned under shady circumstances after criticizing the 9/11 Commission report.  Or Max Cleland who actually resigned from the commission.  Or Kevin Ryan who blew the whistle and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Another-Nineteen-Investigating-Legitimate-Suspects/dp/1489507833">wrote a new book</a> detailed exactly who had the motive and could have pulled off the intricate crimes of 9/11, and he is doing publicity.  Cynthia McKinney served in the House and questioned Rumsfeld and Myers directly.  Richard Gage founded and leads an organization of soon to be over 2,000 whistle blowing architects and engineers.  etc.   </p>

<p>This group reads like a who&#39;s who of Alex Jones guest list: Alex Jones
David Icke
Mark Dice
G. Edward Griffn
Syrian Girl(Youtube)
Charlie Veitch
Gerald Celente
Max Keiser
Ben Swann</p>

<p>They are all media personalities, not an actual list of credible elected officials, whistle blowers, or great researchers.  Bill Still would make a good AMA as well, and has a new movie out.  Ellen Brown as well is known to do interviews and publicity. Luke Rudkowski would be interesting for people who enjoy his story of being an upstart independent journalist.  Lawrence Wilkerson served at the highest levels of gov&#39;t and said he&#39;d testify that the whole Bush Admin knew and knows that the people being force fed in Gitmo are innocent.  You list is scant at best and the other questions are banal drivel in my opinion, and I don&#39;t see how the collection of that information is beneficial to the subreddit, but would be interested in how you think you can use this information to benefit the subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, people are going nuts here.</p>

<p>I think it can be attributed to a few reasons; primarily that this community has a propensity to be overly inductive (I say this in the most loving way possible) haha.</p>

<p>Also, people have a special attachment to this place as one of the last bastion&#39;s of &quot;anonymity and freedom&quot; on reddit; so I think most of what you&#39;re seeing is general distrust at reddit inc being taken out on you.</p>

<p>With that said, you could waltz into <a href="/r/soccer">/r/soccer</a> and do this (in fact those guys loved something like this) and you&#39;d be fine; it&#39;s really the userbase and the current political climate that&#39;s driving this response.</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;re not too downtrodden over this, you guys do great work here (stopping trolls while preserving speech rights is a perilous task) and I give you my 100% seal of approval.</p>

<p>How good you are at abstraction? If they can make you buy stuff you don&#39;t need, they are basically controlling you. They hardly need to restrict it to make you buy stuff you don&#39;t need. They can use it to make you go to some desert and shoot people so they can profit from that. They can use it to make you think anything that goes against what they want you to believe is right should be removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. Take a deep breath people. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is an free subreddit on a free site called reddit. Many subreddits have surveys for various (usually stupid) reasons. This is an OPTIONAL survey. Also, the NSA does not datamine like this. They already have a profile of conspiracy theorists as young adult males, and pretty much every extremist position is within that category. If the NSA wants you, they have XKeyscore. Duping you into answering some questions is not how the worlds most advanced intelligence apparatus operates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be too paranoid people it&#39;s only a short survey. English may have been a bit naive by deleting and re-posting this post but it was only because the original had no introduction. 
End of the day this is not a heavy questionnaire, he thought it would offer an insight into the community, nothing more. </p>

<p>I can understand why a lot of you are skeptical about something like this but it is hardly intrusive. EnglshMunichFan is a good guy and he was interested in the statistics of the crowd here is all.  </p>

<p>Should we try to be informative for new readers and build up the <a href="/r/conspiracy/wiki">/r/conspiracy/wiki</a>? </p>

<p><a href="http://en.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/911">/r/conspiracy/wiki first entry on 9/11</a></p>

<p>I think this a great way to share all the information on a topic and would maybe reduce reposts a bit.</p>

<p>Did you like the old flair system of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or do you think its spamming?</p>

<p>Do you like the design of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>Is there intrest in bringing back the &quot;documentary of the week&quot; or something similar?</p>

<p>Should images posts be allowed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now those seem to be great questions.  I understand the need for demographics in particular cases, but in this case what purpose does it serve?  You could never validate the data set, so really why even ask?  </p>

<p>I agree some of the posts seem a little out of hand, and if you want to improve the sub, then the questions should reflect that.</p>

<p>Hey, don&#39;t let failure stop you.  If this is what you really want to do, rehash the survey, drop the demographics, and I&#39;m certain you will get a ton of responses with minimal bitching.</p>

<p>Personally with 9/11, there is so much information, the wiki is a good idea, but we have a sub on that.  I would like to see a sub or wiki on whistle blowers and their information.     </p>
