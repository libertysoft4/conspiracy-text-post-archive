    <div class="md"><p>ha! funny you say that. I recently got into a little back and forth with some MSM jizz swallower on faceB and spun the whole &quot;conspiracy&quot; around him and sent him flying on his head.</p>

<p>After i posted videos of the rebels clearly launching chemical weapons he had the balls to say something along the lines of the legitmacy of the videos is questionable because &quot;god bless syria&quot; was edited at the beginning of the video.</p>

<p>I responded by saying if he is willing to suggest the Assad government made a series of fake videos of &quot;rebels&quot; launching chemical attacks, he better back it up with some proof. otherwise, he needs to take off the tin-foil hat because thats a conspiracy theory no one else agrees with. I think i also threw something about how his proof better be undeniable, and not in the John Kerry sense, just to make sure his coffin was nailed.</p>

<p>I was paying more attention to getting the  info out  which was problematic for various reasons,

<p>As to the info not being in the cache I originally got it before the cache but the original isn&#39;t still online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the time the fear of censorship is way overblown in this subbreddit. It is the wild age of the internet censorship doesn&#39;t work if the consumer wants information he/she will find it. Or the 5 threads on RP he where got &quot;cut off&quot; after a 7 minute segment that was probably about to end. Fucking pointless</p>

<p>But that being said, yes it is more than possible it&#39;s likely reddit is being manipulated by all sorts of goverment institutions manipulating these forums. Reddit is now a massive site and we know there are contracts for &quot;shills&quot; who go around fucking with popular media sources. In reddit they have all sorts of things to manipulate and you will hear some crazy conspiracies. Just don&#39;t rely 100% on reddit for your world events</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just trying to find the distinction between a group of people who supposedly target subreddits and down vote them (the military in this sense) and people who come up one here and down vote someone because they have an unpopular opinion(circle-jerk crew.) Which do you think actually happens more often?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, that&#39;s actually a good point. For what it&#39;s worth, if you had made it clear that you were referring to that kind of posters rather than just normal users who downvote stuff they don&#39;t like, I wouldn&#39;t have taken issue with it. In hindsight I think I may have been the one to respond prematurely.</p>

<p>I think the distinction is first in the aim: what the OP theorizes is the idea of people downvoting comments in an organised manner, so as to promote a certain political point of view. I think circle jerks mostly act out of hubris. 
Second, i think the distinction is in the intention. A circle jerk feels angered or annoyed and wants to get back at the person who made the comment. The organisation OP speaks of isn&#39;t really personal; rather it seeks to eradicate resistance on a scale greater than interpersonality.</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably more to it, but I guess the end result ends up being the same - posts getting downvoted for the wrong reasons. So again, I think your point is valid. I removed my earlier post.</p>
