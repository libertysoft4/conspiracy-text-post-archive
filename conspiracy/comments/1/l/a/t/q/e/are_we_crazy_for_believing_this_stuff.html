    <div class="md"><h5>Not everything you read here is true.</h5>

<p>Example: the leaked Britam emails are very likely to have been a hoax.

<p>Which theories are you having trouble with?</p>

<p>I personally do not believe in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lizard people</li>
<li>chem-trails</li>
<li>MoonLanding conspiracy 

<ul>
<li>we did land on the moon</li>
<li>it is harder to fake a landing than it is to actually go to space.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>just to name a few</p>

<p>I do think the government is lying about</p>

<ul>
<li>JFK</li>
<li>911</li>
<li>Boston</li>
<li>Sandy Hook</li>
</ul>

<p>And I might be wrong... Maybe Obama is a <del>Wizard</del> Lizard. Maybe the Russian Brothers really did plant those bombs and evade the police. Maybe Sandy Hook was the tragedy people say it was.</p>

<p>The advice, in slightly different words, that everyone here gives each-other is:</p>

<p><strong>Try not to let anything you read here affect your life in a negative way.</strong>
Do not let the theories make you so afraid and crippled with fear of the government, to the point where you become unable to do your work. And finally, never stop asking questions if you are not satisfied with the answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem for me is where to draw the line. I have started to question everything. For example, I&#39;ve begun to think that the whole race-war agenda is true, because there is a new neo-nazi club at my school (Indiana University) that has some characteristics that raised a couple of red flags for me:</p>

<p>It&#39;s made up of non-students. </p>

<p>One of them is apparently a marine who served in Iraq three times.</p>

<p>These men were representing the Traditional Youth Network, basically a white supremacist group.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the article: <a href="http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=93696">http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=93696</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t heard of a &quot;race-war&quot; agenda. Let&#39;s imagine it is true for a moment. Lets pretend that some people, way up in command want to purify America.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, It doesn&#39;t matter, and here is why I think it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Hitler <strong>united</strong> the people of Germany. He promised them freedom. He would fix the economy, and he would export the problem causers. (Jews, gypsies, gays, blacks, etc)
Hitler killed many more than just the jewish people.</p>

<p>It is nearly impossible to united the american population in the same way today. There are too many people with a microphone, all yelling at us, telling us what to do, what to think, and how to feel.</p>

<p>In the end, I just end up confused.</p>

<p>The &quot;United&quot; states is far from united. There are many people opposed to going to war with Syria, while there are almost just as many who are pro-war.</p>

<p>The only thing division is good for, is passing laws in secret. While everyone is agruing amongst themselves, congres passes a law so that rich people can have more money.</p>

<p>It is a great environment for parasitic people, but this isn&#39;t what you would want for a race-war. Nationalists, antigays, white-supremasists are losing if there is such a war going on. And they cannot win.  We&#39;ve been allowing more groups in, rather than kicking people out. To kick out all the gays, jews, mexicans, dutch, germans, etc, would put a racists group into a minority. If the racists focuses on a minority, instead of everyone at once, the minority would call out for help. Once again, it would no longer be possibe to kick out the minority due to support they would receive from other groups.</p>

<p>It is no longer possible to unite people like Hitler once did, until the safety of individuals are threatened.</p>

<p>At that point you might see simular things like &quot;japanese-americans 1942&quot; &lt;-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment</a></p>

<p>I am sure you&#39;ll meet lots of people who are proud to be racist. I feel sorry for those people. They do nothing constructive with their lives, and are on the wrong side. There is no longer a large white majourity. If you want to be in the majourity, chances are you&#39;ll have to team with someone else. And as soon as you team up, we stop caring about race, or colour, or sexual preference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why everything is so polarized here, let&#39;s take the moon landing for instance.  Why isn&#39;t it possible it was BOTH faked AND real?  </p>

<p>I mean, it would make sense to show the public a &#39;show&#39; in case of disaster (or perhaps to hide something?)  There is evidence of some trickery involved, however this doesn&#39;t mean the entire moon landing was faked.  I believe we have put men on the moon, but I have no reason to trust <em>anything</em> the government says <em>ever</em>, which includes <em>everything</em> that comes out of that idiot box.</p>

<p>So remember, conspiracies don&#39;t always have to be so polar, and I believe most often the truth is a combination.  Creating polarities is another trick of <em>them</em> to divide, and thus conquer.</p>

<p>Well I have seen a number of sites analyzing photographs of the moon and plenty of them seem to be censored for one reason or another (also evidence of shitty photo doctoring).  Lack of evidence is not evidence, but it is another point in a series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook was one of the most obvious false-flag attacks in American history.</p>

<p>There are so many things wrong...the KTIR for one. Trained mercenaries would (pun coming) KILL for a killed-to-injured ratio that &quot;Lanza&quot; got. Killing that many people in that timeframe IS NOT POSSIBLE--even for some of the best shooters on the planet. Certainly not with one brain-damaged kid. That was teamwork in action.</p>

<p>Not to mention that the &quot;official story&quot; changed literally hundreds of times. AND that MANY &quot;crisis actors&quot; (read up on the Greenberg/Phelps family) were used. AND that the staging area for the wounded was EMPTY...AND that police lied (twice) about what type of gun was used...I can go on for paragraphs.</p>

<p>If I see ONE FRAME of video from their &quot;newly-installed security system&quot; that shows Lanza holding a gun I&#39;ll reconsider. If I see ONE FRAME of him entering the school I&#39;d reconsider.</p>

<p>Kids DID die and that sucks...but they likely died at the hands of two-three highly trained and likely-Israeli mercenaries...NOT at the hands of a whackjob kid who was off his meds with no firearms training.</p>

<p>Why must there always be a reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what makes me look for patterns and ask tough question. Life would be so much easier if I didn&#39;t. Following the news, and hearing what is going on in Syria, and thinking about what might be the best way to solve this conflict is time consuming.</p>

<p>Thankfully I can think about these things while doing my daily work without much interuption.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asked by friends and family the same question. Why do I care so much what is happening over half the world away from me. &quot;There is nothing you can do about it anyways.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am convinced that the act of thinking logically cannot possibly be natural to the human mind. If it were, then mathematics would be everybody&#39;s easiest course at school and our species would not have taken several millennia to figure out the scientific method.”  ~ Neil Tyson Degrasse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am convinced that it is not in everyone&#39;s nature to be curious, to recognize patterns, and to care about what is going on around us. In fact, I am convinced of the oposite. </p>

<p>I grew up on a farm. Whenever things broke they had to be fixed. There wasn&#39;t always time or money to call a mechanic or technician. During my teens and early 20&#39;s I attended school for software Engineering. </p>

<p>So most of my life, I have been trained to look for problems and attempt to fix them. </p>

<p>The most honest answer for myself, to the question, must there always be a reason? is &#39;yes&#39;.</p>

<p>I agree that life can be shit at times. Sometimes the cause is my own stupidity. Sometimes the cause is outside of my controll. However, I always do my best to find the cause. I agree that not everything is the government&#39;s fault, and not every question comes with an answer. </p>

<p>I believe you and friends of mine are correct that <strong>&quot;Some questions are not mine to ask, medeling in other people&#39;s business can sometimes make things worse.&quot;</strong> You never said this directly, but looking at your post history, I think its a safe assumption to make. Am I right?</p>

<p>There is a danger when I am still uncertain about something and post my thought. Some people, who do not have the natural tendency to ask questions and investigate, might read something and take it as the word of God. Even after I have already changed my mind, there&#39;ll still be people holding on to incorrect ideas because they happend to fit their world view.</p>

<p>Hope this made sense and didn&#39;t take to long to read.</p>

<p>Ignore the haters, and have good day.</p>

<p>Thanks for staying polite!</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) You are not nuts.</p>

<p>2.) Few people look into the details of claims made on CNN.</p>

<p>3.) Conspiracies are <a href="http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/criminal-conspiracy-lawyers.html">demonstrably real</a>. All you need to do is open a news paper and go to the business section. Then again, the official line for 9/11 is that a group of people [Al Qaeda] acted in secret to perpetrate a crime [planes in buildings] involving death [about 3k]; this is the dictionary definition of conspiracy.</p>

<p>4.) You said: &quot;I&#39;m starting to doubt my conspiratorial side.&quot; You are not the one committing a crime via conspiracy. You are connecting the dots in such a way that other people&#39;s actions become obvious. Your ability to think clearly means that you&#39;re going to spot things that others cannot. This doesn&#39;t make you better than them. It doesn&#39;t make you bad. You will simply have to adjust.</p>

<p>5.) Expect to have your world view shattered now and again. You will always be learning. Keep learning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No we are not crazy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m presuming you are relatively new to this information, no? </p>

<p>Despite the controversy, there are plenty of conspiracies that not only been revealed to publicity, but also conspiracies theories that have so much evidence being shown with them- that they might as well no longer be considered a theory.</p>

<p>You want to hit your friends back with something that will make them think?  Ask them what a conspiracy is. If they are reluctant to answer, or find themselves to be completely wrong, ask them why they are so impetuous to deny something they are fully ignorant of.</p>

<p>Try to bring philosophic rebuttals into the conversation, usually the person will find themselves acting pretentious but won&#39;t admit it.</p>

<p>You see sometimes people become so heavily diluted that for someone to help bring awareness to them, ends up becoming more threatening than anything. It hits them in their ego, and to say &quot;Im wrong&quot; is one of the hardest things for them. </p>

<p>You are going beyond and above by actually questioning things, by not settling for something because you are told to. I love that, and that&#39;s why people in this subreddit exist. Their too smart to ignore something that&#39;s rational without letting their ego infiltrate the thought process. </p>

<p>Let me say this, a lot of people have been in your shoes. Myself included. It&#39;s going to be inevitable when you get into these discussions. That&#39;s why you aim for uncontroversial subjects (although almost anything becomes controversial to the diluted) and hope that eventually you will hit a nerve in their brain and will disengage the illusion briefly. If they choose to ignore something that has more than enough credibility, that&#39;s their own problem. </p>

<p>Usually it&#39;s the age that hinders the ability to converse with coherency. It&#39;s ok though, don&#39;t let these things stress you out or even make you question your own intuition. It sounds like you are confused, but remembering to keep your mind open, remember to look more attentively, remember that knowledge is your ultimate companion. </p>

<p>It took my bestfriend 5 years to apologize for the way he thought of me. In fact I thought I was never going to see him again. In his own time he started to learn about stuff that he use to think of me as crazy to believe. Next thing you know we finally were able to talk about something without the discussion turning into me being an extremist. </p>

<p>But the hardest part for me was to accept that my friend was simply being ignorantly pretentious, even if it was unintentionally. I wasn&#39;t quite sure how to deal with it at the time. I was learning things that was changing my life- while being called an extremist at the same time. </p>

<p>It was very hard to adapt with the criticism, especially when it came from friends or family, but whether or not they changed to learn to have an open mind, I persisted to keep learning.
So to this day, I praise myself for not comparing myself to irrational opinions, I am grateful to take the path of knowledge and to not stand in line like the rest. </p>

<p>My advice may be a tad bit lengthy, but please- whatever you do- don&#39;t condemn yourself. You are on the verge of something beautiful, and with given time, maturity, empiricism, and knowledge- you too will find understanding of why you think the way you do. </p>

<p>Edit: I am glad to see other users trying to help too. As you can see, you&#39;re not alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the stigma of being a conspiracy theorist can be tough. 
People will treat you different as soon as they hear your &quot;crazy&quot; 
Ideas about ufos or Kennedy assassination  or 9/11 etc. 
I think it&#39;s a good thing to question what one is told that you don&#39;t experience first hand for yourself. 
All that being said, what if you were right about one or more theories?
What actions would or could you take?<br/>
Personally I refer to my interest in weird and fringe theory as a hobby of my wild imagination. No harm in brainstorming ideas for a future essay or book or campfire ghost story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will often feel crazy, because so many adults you will interact with during a normal day cannot or will not look at the way things are and that gets lonely. It is too scary, or distant or in some other way inconceivable for them. When it seems like you&#39;re the only one around worried about big, actual problems instead of hooting like an animal over a plastic ass on television it is hard to feel ok about it. The simplest solution is that you are crazy rather than the rest of the world being crazy, but I don&#39;t think that is how it is. Accepting that this age of humanity is enthusiastically self-destructive is an uncomfortable thing to do, and doubting your own search is a very easy thing to do. Most people are ok with being asleep to what a tank of gas or a cheeseburger really mean and it is easier to shoot the messenger than start to re-evaluate ones entire material existence. </p>

<p>Having people who are close who refuse to think about things wouldn&#39;t be easy I&#39;d imagine. I am lucky in that all of the ones who matter in my life are aware of how fucked up things are, so I don&#39;t know what I would do if someone very close to me just couldn&#39;t see it. I don&#39;t think I would lose a friend over it, but I would lose a little respect for them. </p>

<p>TLDR keep fighting the good fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read some books on the subjects.  I suggest reading the book &quot;Foundations: Their Power and Influence&quot; by Rene Wormser.  Its hard to find anywhere outside of amazon and its 20 bucks used on amazon but its worth owning and you can shove this in your friends&#39; and boyfriend&#39;s face.  Its a book that describes the events and findings of the Reece Committee on Tax Exempt Foundations how they are subverting the US culture using NGOs and big money foundations(think Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, Carnegie, etc etc etc) all working in tandem to change culture to fit into a &quot;global&quot; culture to bring about the New World Order.  It is still happening today.  Do not trust non-profits, advocacy groups, Non-Governmental Organizations(NGOs) or big corporate foundations, they are all working for the UN(for the most part, the big ones definitely are) and they are where the <em>BIG</em> open conspiracy lies.  A lot of this other shit is just speculation that no one really has answers for, but this, there is proof and you can physically SEE it happening.  We document this shit over at <a href="/r/UNAgenda21">/r/UNAgenda21</a>  You have to be past the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> level 1 mainstream media BS to really &quot;get it&quot; though.  Just saying.</p>

<p>I can recommend more books too if you&#39;d like.  They usually are well cited and have good info.  </p>

<p>911 for instance, simply impossible to believe or trust the government version when you spend the time to learn the facts.
NWO is in black and white in various places, its proven, its a real agenda.
Chemtrails are real, airborne weather modification and geo-engineering are real, they use real bad chemicals that have real bad effects on the environment or any living thing that comes into contact.
False flags and crisis actors are real, were they used in Sandy Hook and Boston? Plenty to suggest it as strong possibility, even to an impartial observer.
Secret societies exist. The media lies. The government lies. Regulatory bodies lie. Corruption is rampant. Big Pharma cares more about $ than it does about you. War is for profit. The education system is designed to manufacture conformity not to educate. Nazism = Zionism. Crop circles are bullshit. UFOs are unidentified, not alien. Lizards have tails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice: Keep an open mind. Always be willing to accept new information and change your mind. If you consider what you know, and think you know, as opinions, and not beliefs, no one can tell you you&#39;re wrong. As soon as you say &quot;I believe x...&quot;, it implies that you have no room to reconsider or accept other input. A belief is only an opinion that one refuses to reconsider. Maintain your opinions, and continue to seek out evidence supporting your opinions. Grow. And, if the evidence does not support your opinions, move on, accept what truth you can, and grow. Neither one is bad or good, it is only what you do with your opinions that matters. Hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not wrong to question things (especially war motives since they&#39;re really dumb) and its no surprise the government is dumb too. It&#39;s crazy to believe more radical things like 9/11 was inside job, NWO, etc. because they&#39;re so unbelievable and assume that evil super villains, not political ineptitude, is our enemy. Plus it&#39;s hard to find proof of that sort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem for me is where to draw the line. I have started to question everything. For example, I&#39;ve begun to think that the whole race-war agenda is true, because there is a new neo-nazi club at my school (Indiana University) that has some characteristics that raised a couple of red flags for me:</p>

<p>It&#39;s made up of non-students. </p>

<p>One of them is apparently a marine who served in Iraq three times.</p>

<p>These men were representing the Traditional Youth Network, basically a white supremacist group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why everything is so polarized here, let&#39;s take the moon landing for instance.  Why isn&#39;t it possible it was BOTH faked AND real?  </p>

<p>I mean, it would make sense to show the public a &#39;show&#39; in case of disaster (or perhaps to hide something?)  There is evidence of some trickery involved, however this doesn&#39;t mean the entire moon landing was faked.  I believe we have put men on the moon, but I have no reason to trust <em>anything</em> the government says <em>ever</em>, which includes <em>everything</em> that comes out of that idiot box.</p>

<p>So remember, conspiracies don&#39;t always have to be so polar, and I believe most often the truth is a combination.  Creating polarities is another trick of <em>them</em> to divide, and thus conquer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK...the leaked Britam email are false yet playing out <em>to the very letter</em> huh?</p>

<p>Now if that is not the definition of an <strong>amazing fucking coincidence</strong> I&#39;m not sure what is.</p>

<p>Oh, btw, the message IDs of the Britam emails have been examined and many, many security experts say that they ARE true (not that it&#39;s hard to tell, what with them playing out <em>as I write this</em>).</p>
