<p>I think that&#39;s a pretty decent question, but I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of the mods realize that at least SOME memes, like I mentioned in this thread, do offer some insight that help disseminate information faster than could otherwise be the case.  Not all certainly, but some.</p>

<p>My one vote does absolutely nothing when I wake up and find a bullshit meme from this subreddit on the front page two days in a row. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a bad point.  Another point, however, is that what you might consider a bullshit meme might be the beginning of valid conversation to someone else.  I don&#39;t know what meme you&#39;re talking about, but I feel there is still some validity in what I just said.</p>

<p>So then perhaps it&#39;s not so much memes in and of themselves that we should be wary of, but of - as you said - submissions that have the intent to discredit this subreddit even more to the public eye.</p>

<p>I would agree with that.  Comments or energy or submissions with that intent in mind <em>should</em> indeed be given the heave ho.  Mods should be aware of that.</p>

This is not to say that I am some sort of &quot;Super Pro MEME!&quot; advocate or whatnot.  I&#39;m not.  There are some memes on here that I personally feel <em>are</em> stupid and make me roll my eyes.

<p>Yeah but you know what?  I don&#39;t even look at the &quot;popular&quot; tab any more.  I personally have &quot;new&quot; as my default practically.  That&#39;s because <em>I</em> want to find out what  <em>I</em> feel is important and what isn&#39;t in this sub.  I don&#39;t want it to be decided for me what post is &quot;important&quot; and which one isn&#39;t by some possibly manipulative vote brigade or even by a lot of upvotes that WEREN&#39;T brigaded but that may be about a subject that I personally happen to not have all that much interest in.</p>

<p>I, therefore, go to the &quot;new&quot; tab more often than not nowadays because that&#39;s simply where I find out what&#39;s really coming through the pipe line before it gets manipulated by up/downvotes, etc.</p>

<p>I personally think that if more people would do that, then the whole issue we&#39;re discussing here might kind of turn into a moot point because then things wouldn&#39;t get viewed in terms of &quot;what the hive mind thinks is popular&quot; or not.  I find that the &quot;new&quot; tab might be a more objective manner of viewing what&#39;s submitted here, and as such, kind of makes the amount of space that&#39;s available for the &quot;most popular&quot; posts kind of, again, moot.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I understand that perspective too.  I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t have a point there.  I think that those that come to this subreddit are or at least <em>should</em> be of a more discerning perspective and capability though, right?  Those in this sub are people that <em>do</em> question the PTB narrative and DON&#39;T buy what&#39;s shoveled on the MSM as easily as others might.  As such, there actually shouldn&#39;t be all THAT much concern about &quot;what gets viewed by the most amount of people&quot; because (hopefully anyway) most people in this sub will be able to keep scrolling through the possible turd posts (meme or non meme) and pay more attention to the real worthy ones.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m giving people a bit too much benefit of the doubt, but this is how I&#39;m thinking about it right now anyway.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Another valid point on your part.  I understand this.  There is definite worth in this perspective.  However, I wouldn&#39;t say that for this reason, all memes should necessarily get banned from this sub.</p>

<p>All things to think about though, and you, again, make good points.  Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Derailing. Your post should be removed. Poor punctuation and several edits. You&#39;re crying for attention. Relevant &quot;memes&quot; should be allowed; scumbag Steves and Stacys no. It isn&#39;t taking over. As a growing sub we should adapt the normality of memes while removing memes not relevant. This sub will not grow unless we accept newer/younger generations of &quot;social media&quot; as it is because it grows and will continue to.

    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is to have correct spelling, punctuation and grammar. Your stance will be better understood and will have a larger impact. That said... </p>

<p>Memes have their use. That&#39;s what they are used for. A simple image with a simple message. The typical memes have no place here. Like I said before things like scumbag Steve/Stacy, blb, that matrix one, suddenly clear kid etc etc... Have no place here as per the rule. But an image such as a the ones this sub is considering &quot;memes&quot; are not &quot;memes&quot; because it is not mainstream or current pop culture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you also need to consider it in terms of the fact that front page space is limited - especially the posts in the top 5 or 10 which are the ones that reach the largest audience. If a bunch of memes keep making the front page - even if they&#39;re valid - then there are necessarily other posts which are not making the front page.</p>

<p>Also consider that a meme, even a valid one, would probably be perceived as less of a &quot;threat&quot; than a more well-sourced/researched post if we&#39;re assuming that there are indeed those here trying to keep certain discussions suppressed with downvote bots and the like.</p>
