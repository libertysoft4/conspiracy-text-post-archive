        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The revelation of these facts did not phase them. </p>

<p>If I were doing something unpopular which I believed to be a covert operation (e.g., painting graffiti) and I heard about my own operation through the grapevine, or if it made some kind of local news, ... and there was an implication that someone, somewhere, might actually know my identity... I&#39;d be hesitant to continue that activity.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that Greenwald not only knows about these infiltration activities from an arm&#39;s length reporting stance (what he&#39;s been willing to say in the public spectrum), but also that he has access to (or at least Snowden had access at one time to) information pertaining to the specific activities being undertaken (which social media sites - I&#39;m assuming all of the big ones), but... more threatening... the actual participants identities... either in the form of real names or online avatars.</p>

<p>The problem I&#39;m having now is...</p>

<p>The shilling hasn&#39;t stopped.</p>

<p>No one is afraid.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhm the CIA was caught funding cocaine dealing death squads and selling weapons to Iran to further fund those death squads in the 80s.</p>

<p>No one cared. Oliver North, who helped orchestrate the weapons deals and knew all about the drug dealing as head of Reagan&#39;s NSC, is a popular talking head on fox news. </p>

<p>People forget the NSA was caught spying on everyone back in the 70s. The CIA was caught slipping citizens LSD. FBI was caught blackmailing and assassinating and infiltrating. Who was arrested? Who was held accountable? NO one. There was a congressional report admitting everything, and then nothing substantial happened.</p>

<p>It has always been like this. Just appreciate the fact that more people are waking up due to the internet and people like Snowden/Greenwald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By simple virtue of the fact that the NSA is in the news for spying on everyone, more people are waking up. Most people probably didn&#39;t even know what the NSA was in the 90s. At least now most people know the NSA is spying on everyone, even if not all of them care.</p>

<p>Conspiracies can be best fought once they are given mainstream credibility, frankly. If everyone thinks you&#39;re crazy for believing a particular conspiracy, good luck stopping it. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and all that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because no one understands what is being presented here. No one has demonstrated a thorough understanding of what has been created. What is already running and has been for years and years. We are asking &quot;what sites?&quot; and &quot;who&#39;s involved?&quot; Instead of what and why. There is no threat. No one has a clue what the problem is because the system itself has everyone completely deluded.</p>

<p>The system is tracking everything. If you are alive you are tracked and profiled. Everything. Everythibg you say, type, do, where, how and with who. It&#39;s just metadata right? Haha. Yes it is because that&#39;s how the system organizes the info to maintain your profile and manipulate every thought,  belief and insight you have through content exposure and flat out physical manipulation.  Food, pharma, radio/microwaves, light and of course high level programming through media content online, tv etc. PER PERSON. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a frickin computer to put it simply!! It&#39;s not who it&#39;s what! There is no one looking at the records because it would be impossible. The shills are patsies and there are millions of them. They are just people silently nudged towards their purpose. Engineered responses to your response all orchestrated through the same system.  It&#39;s so absolutely science fiction no one gets it. There is no threat. Once people see what&#39;s going on they realize that there effort to overcome it was ALL wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be afraid. I mean that sincerely. Have no attachment to what is being implied through your online experience. Much of it is vapid and meaningless in the grand scheme of things. And by online I mean everything you perceive as being collectively experienced through all media.  It was inevitable that from technology a system like this would evolve. It is a physical manifestation of the disconnect man has suffered since the IAm duality. It&#39;s going and the only way it will end is disaster. On a personal and collective level to overcome it we should seek peace in ourselves first and the experience of absolute truth beyond the religion of science and technology.  People have been oppressed by delusion forever. The novelty is in it&#39;s present manifestation but the essence is the same. The last weapon in it&#39;s arsenal is to be scary. To frighten you with it&#39;s power and massiveness. Look right into it and you see a rotting computer with failing hard drives and burnt out memory. And a pile of patsies tending to it&#39;s temporality. It&#39;s going to implode and people dependent on it are going to suffer.</p>

<p>Early in this saga, some random redditor pointed out &quot;what good is a global surveillance state, if the people don&#39;t know about it? - Big Brother <em>wants</em> you to know he&#39;s watching you.&quot;</p>

<p>And, here we are with the Greenwald article stickied - reminding everyone... Big Brother is watching you.</p>

<p>Because it had we&#39;d be able to infer how much money effort and time was poured down the drain. By the governments above us or in other nations.</p>

<p><code>&gt;No one is afraid.</code></p>

<p>Well I mean if one government stops paying shills do they lead the next generation astray like the Pied-Piper?</p>

<p>Do other nations decide that if one nations give up they sohuld just pack it in because espionage isn&#39;t fun without them?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be concerned if they stopped, if only because I&#39;d feel like I was wasting my time espousing unpopular opinions online with no one to stop me. <code>;_;</code></p>

<p><code>&gt;Why not?</code></p>

<p>If the paid posting stopped all of a sudden on them being exposed by someone then the internet wins. Sure, we&#39;d have the right to self-determination in our online communities. </p>

<p>But when has a government mistake exposed on this scale been followed by an apology and an altered policy? Do they think it&#39;s a mistake to continue?</p>

<p>Probably not. They continue cause we can&#39;t do anything, they see everything and how did you plan to object?</p>

<p><strong>OFTEN AND IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS</strong> was what was I was thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making an assumption Greenwald has actual names, he may not.  The reason, though, that no shill is afraid is because even if you knew their real name, they could just never associate it with work online, shouldn&#39;t be that hard if they got the NSA-bypass for Google+ registration, and avatars can change. The scariest shit though is like, what if everyone is in on it?  The Statsi&#39;s had about 1 informant for every 3 citizens thereabouts.  I wonder what the internet ratio looks like?  If Greenwald knows he gotta tell or he&#39;s in on it</p>
