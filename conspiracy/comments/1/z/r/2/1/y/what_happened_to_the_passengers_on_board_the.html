    <div class="md"><p>One theory I found interesting was that the planes landed at military bases en-route, and outfitted remote controlled planes took over the GPS signals and continued on their path. </p>

<p>I suppose the passengers were then forced to recorded make fake phone-calls at the military base which were later given to media and claimed to have been made during the flights, then killed. </p>

<p>Operation Northwoods mentioned that the passengers would be evacuated also, which is something to keep in mind. </p>

<p>There are plenty of &quot;theories&quot; surrounding the passengers that could be possible, but very little evidence available to make any certain judgement on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair question.  i believe the answer is this:</p>

<p>the commercial planes were NOT outfitted with high-accuracy remote control equipment.</p>

<p>the commercial planes crossed-paths with gray, military planes that WERE outfitted with high-accuracy remote control equipment.</p>

<p>the commercial and military decoys crossed paths in mid-air...</p>

<p>as they crossed paths in mid-air (within 1 mile), the commercial plans had their transponders turned off.</p>

<p>and the remote military plane went on to the targets.</p>

<p>when the commercial planes landed, the passengers were herded off the planes.  1 or 2 to were forced to make a phone call to say good bye to family.  and then all of the passengers were executed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhh, I see.</p>

<p>I actually heard a very interesting point on here recently. Someone suggested that maybe there was a remote guidance system in play, but the passengers were still on board. The Shanksville plane (93?) genuinely did have the passengers storm the cockpit. However, once they realised that the plane was not being flown by the men in the cockpit, or that the cockpit was empty, the plane was smashed into a field to silence them all and stop the world from finding out.</p>

<p>I dont believe that myself, but found it interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a strictly logistical point of view, it would be simplest to take control of the autopilots remotely and fly the planes into the towers/Pentagon. That would certainly explain the incredibly precise piloting by hijackers who couldn&#39;t solo a Cessna, and as a bonus, no pesky witnesses to contend with.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s factor replacement planes into the equation, as this is the only logical way to achieve adequate performance characteristics.</p>

<p>This would require a &quot;switch&quot;, which was only possible when the hijacked planes were doing dipsy-doodle flight path crossings, formation flying and transponder shenanigans before returning to their intended targets.</p>

<p>So now we have remote-controlled military planes and remote controlled passenger planes.  We know where the military planes ended up.  How do you cover up the switch?</p>

<p>You fly those passenger planes out over the Atlantic while everybody is focused on planes going the other way.  Then you crash them into the ocean once you get out far enough.</p>

<p>No pesky witnesses to contend with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with this is that standard boeing jets couldn&#39;t have done what these planes did. That is, fly as fast as they did without falling apart. The top speed of one is like 400 knots. I think the South tower plane was going over 500 knots or something like that. It&#39;s not possible unless the planes were enhanced/military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is false. A Boeing 767 is fully capable of reaching 500 knots (it&#39;s cruise speed is between 460-480), and doesn&#39;t sustain damage until much higher. In a dive, such as it&#39;s proposed trajectory in 9/11, it can exceed those speeds even at low altitudes. </p>

Newsweek published a story several days after 9/11 that discusses how several of the pilots previously lived at addresses on US Air Force bases in the years before the attacks. The USAF trains the Saudi Air Force. This also explains why they essentially blew off the private pilot lessons. They knew it was just to create a paper trail and really wasn&#39;t necessary for 9/11 to succeed. </p>
