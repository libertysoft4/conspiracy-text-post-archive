        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>I was reading Thoth&#39;s Emerald Tablets which are really really interesting. and I saw this and needless to say I was a little freaked out:</strong></p>

<p>Far in the past before Atlantis existed,
men there were who delved into darkness,
using dark magic, calling up beings
from the great deep below us.
Forth came they into this cycle.
Formless were they of another vibration,
existing unseen by the children of earth-men.
Only through blood could they have formed being.
Only through man could they live in the world.</p>

<p>In ages past were they conquered by Masters,
driven below to the place whence they came.
But some there were who remained,
hidden in spaces and planes unknown to man.
Lived they in Atlantis as shadows,
but at times they appeared among men.
Aye, when the blood was offered,
for they came they to dwell among men.</p>

<p>In the form of man they amongst us,
but only to sight were they as are men.
Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted
but appearing to man as men among men.
Crept they into the Councils,
taking forms that were like unto men.
Slaying by their arts
the chiefs of the kingdoms,
taking their form and ruling o&#39;er man.
Only by magic could they be discovered.
Only by sound could their faces be seen.
Sought they from the Kingdom of shadows
to destroy man and rule in his place.</p>

<p>But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic,
able to lift the Veil from the face of the serpent,
able to send him back to his place.
Came they to man and taught him the secret,
the WORD that only a man can pronounce.
Swift then they lifted the Veil from the serpent
and cast him forth from the place among men.</p>

<p>Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth
in a place that is open at times to the world.
Unseen they walk among thee
in places where the rites have been said.
Again as time passes onward
shall they take the semblance of men.</p>

<p><strong>So I was like what! A word! Thoth doesn&#39;t mention the word in the tablet so what is it!? I started to Google search and found the word is apparently:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Kinninigan&quot;.</p>

<p>Not sure how they figured out that was the word, the book I found it mentioned in was &quot;The Emerald Tablets of Thoth the Atlantean&quot; By Doreal not exactly sure how he figured out the word...</p>

<p>But apparently if you can corner a reptilian and tell them to say it they won&#39;t be able to, or if you say it to them they turn, some cool shit like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any intel is better than no intel at all. For those of you who think &quot;reptilians&quot; can&#39;t be real, you need to see it live to change your views. I think it&#39;s bullshit how you mock someone who tries to help a community. It is you who needs to do more researching and open your eyes. Might I suggest researching the oral history of Africa, particularly the Zulu tribe for starters and work your way from their. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all: I find the source dubious, as the emerald tablets were quite deliberately hidden away from people of our times, and anyone who claims to know anything about them has discovered it through <em>channelling</em> some entity or another. And secondly: If this were real, a tone would certainly accompany the word; how are we to know whether say it in a high, piping leprechaun voice, or a low giant&#39;s rumble; or are we to expect the reptoids to simply cower while we try it out in different voices. Some wicked Jinn is surely laughing his arse off over this in his wilderness cubbyhole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but if it were man made it would also try to tie jews as being reptiles some how. The word isn&#39;t in the tablets at all so to say a tone would accompany when it&#39;s not there at all doesn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>What if that&#39;s what the tablets say and Doreal is the huckster who &quot;channeled&quot; to find the word and then print it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post, I&#39;ve been researching this stuff lately. </p>

<p>I&#39;m having this daydream where I attend an important business conference, and seated at the head are a bunch of sinister men in black suits, conspiring about how they&#39;re going to &quot;make so much money and increase shareholder value&quot; by displacing an indigenous South American tribe in order to drill for oil in the Amazon. They&#39;re laughing about how these undeveloped apes do not have a stake on their land and how they deserve to live in poverty after they&#39;re displaced because they&#39;re so uncivilized.  I&#39;m in the conference and I stand up and say the word Kinninigan, with all my focused attention and personal power. First they stare at me all crazy, but after I repeat it a few times, they start to shake. Their human form melts away, and they&#39;re reduced to the reptillians that they are.  Everybody else in the room stares wide eyes and the spell of corruption is broken. A minute later the room is silent and the reptilians are gone. Nobody else noticed that they were there to begin with, it&#39;s like their memories were wiped. But they all agree unanimously that the nefarious deal is off.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this on the conspiracy sub reddit.
I greatly enjoy any occult post on the conspiracy boards.</p>

<p>Although I am not sure why so many people on here are dissing the tablet&#39;s, I can however understand their ignorance.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly the tablets themselves are the product of alchemical transmutation.
It&#39;s fantastic how they cannot be altered by science. They cannot break or be destroyed. </p>

<p>The best part about it is that the wisdom contained is immeasurable. 
At every level of consciousness you can pull something remarkable every time you read from the tablets.</p>

<p>I would love to hold them in my hands for a moment or two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You never know. I&#39;ve been a heavy conspiracy nut for a while and I just learned about Thoth and Kinninigan.</p>

<p>So if I&#39;ve been here this long and not heard of it then it&#39;s gotta be news to other people. I mean there&#39;s some doubters in here but how many people are running in going &quot;That&#39;s old! This is old! Anyone who knows David Icke knows this shit!&quot;</p>

<p>And if I found out apparent bad guys had an Achilles heel and didn&#39;t tell people about it then I wouldn&#39;t be a very big conspiracy nut then would I?</p>
