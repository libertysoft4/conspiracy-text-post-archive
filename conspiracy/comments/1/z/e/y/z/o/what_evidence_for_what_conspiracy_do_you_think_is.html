<p>I&#39;m a subjectivist : I believe objectivity is a lie or at best an ideal to strive towards when reporting events.</p>

<p>We keep fighting over evidence and proof but no amount of proof will convince a believer.</p>

<p>Granted this opinion of mine is dishonest because I personally don&#39;t care about proof : I don&#39;t investigate, I merely collect theories and pickup the ones I like best.</p>

<p>Even so, events give evidence to my theory that subjectivity is what drives us more than &quot;proof&quot; or Reason ever do.</p>

<p>Time and time again the presence of truth proves not to be enough to sway public opinion, what shows to be mattering instead is the willingness and readiness of said people to look at said idea without flinching.</p>

<p>There is terrible, gigantic proof of pedocriminal networks being supported and covered up by the authorities of all countries. Do we go there? No, because we&#39;re not ready nor willing. Only a minority is, and it fights in the desert.</p>

<p>So when you want to rule over a people you don&#39;t do it with evidence, you do it by setting the norms beyond which said people wont dare to look at what you want to hide.</p>

<p>If I want to be further pessimistic I&#39;ll remind you that a quarter of the population of Belgium marched in its Bruxelles capital to bring the pedo networks criminals to justice against the coverup of the authorities. It didn&#39;t happen. So even when the people are ready and willing, it&#39;s still not enough.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s keep mooing and baaing (because that&#39;s what we&#39;re in fact doing here), pay our taxes and give our children to Moloch.</p>

<p>The fact remains that the backpack that exploded matches the ones carried by the Craft International personnel not the one carried by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  and that you can see the Craft person carrying such a backpack into the bombing area. You do not see it carried by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</p>

<p>Addressing the big issues like motive and capacity to commit the crime also helps us avoid nitpicking the scientific minutia.  Because most of us aren&#39;t expert scientists so it doesn&#39;t really matter what &quot;adds up&quot; in our minds.  There&#39;s no sense in splitting hairs over the details of things we don&#39;t understand, especially when we can find &quot;expert&quot; voices on either side of the issue.</p>

<p>Well in the real world when you&#39;re trying to demonstrate guilt, you&#39;re obligated to speak to motive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s when crimes are investigated.</p>

<p>911 was never investigated as a crime.</p>

<p>The Bush admin setup a congressional commission more than a year after the act and tried to appoint arch-war-criminal Henry Kissinger at its head. Several members of said commission later went public denouncing its bias and absence of following of normal investigating rules : testimonies weren&#39;t even looked for, evidence wasn&#39;t gathered, conflicts of interest abounded and so on (don&#39;t ask me for sources, I&#39;m going from memory).</p>

<p>In the real world there are crimes that are not investigated because the rulers who would be ordering the investigation happen to be involved.</p>

<p>So when debating 911 we&#39;re not talking about a crime that&#39;s been officially investigated. When proponents of the official theory require that we abide by legal rules it&#39;s the pot calling the kettle black.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need to explain motives for blowing up building 7, we just need to give evidence that it was blown up or evidence that it didn&#39;t collapse due to the damage caused by the towers.</p>

<p>We are indeed in a comfortable argumentation position but it&#39;s the ruthless fascist cunts in power who gave it to us.</p>

<p>We do have many motives for them blowing up building 7 BTW : command center was there, records were there, security firms were there. But we don&#39;t need to bring them up.</p>

<p>On another tangent, I&#39;d like to interject that the shills won this debate on alt.conspiracy 10 years ago. This is why we&#39;re here, politically. Citizen Joe Blow with an internet connection didn&#39;t win the fight.</p>

<p>Another problem with the above flight 77 footage is the white smoke:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can&#39;t be fuel because it didn&#39;t caught fire (lawn completely intact)</li>
<li>Can&#39;t be engine damage smoke because it only produces a thin and dark smoke</li>
<li>Can&#39;t be contrails because the humidity of that day wasn&#39;t sufficient to produce them</li>
<li>Can&#39;t be engine exaust condensation because the temperature of that day wasn&#39;t sufficient to produce them</li>
</ul>

<p>So what kind of aircraft/flying object produced the recorded smoke if flight 77 couldn&#39;t have done it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what conspiracy? the bush cabinet was in a frantic, paranoid mindset after 9/11 and jumped the gun. </p>

<p>if 9/11 was in inside job, then why was it not perpetrated by iraqi al qaeda members? why would the premise not place the blame on where they really wanted to go?</p>

<p>the premise for iraq was based on intelligence briefings from the cia and other secret agencies (from the UK and germany). </p>

<p>the only one that was proven to be false was the &#39;yellow cake uranium&#39; order from nigeria (interestingly enough, inspectors did find yellow cake uranium in iraq in 2008). However, this led to the Valerie Plume leak scandal (and subsequent charges), which subsequently revealed how little the cabinet was aware of the intelligence reports.</p>

<p>the bush cabinet did not personally create the false report in order to go into iraq. any real conspiracy would have had iraqi terrorists, rock solid reasons and reports, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bush cabinet was in a paranoid mindset because they just watched more americans perish in front of them then any other administration. in the months following the attacks, there were anthrax scares, thousands of intelligence reports of threats and the cabinet was right in the middle of it.</p>

<p>in fact, there was one instance in the weeks after 9/11 where the white house was sent a supposed  laced letter. Bush, Rice, and a few other members were in China, and during a video conference, Cheney told the others that they may all have been fatal exposed. </p>

<p>Literally, all of them were dealing with these sorts of realities while being fed multiple lines of intelligence.</p>

<p>So why was it not a conspiracy? Because the &#39;fabrication&#39; was not literally made up out of thin air in order to go into Iraq. There was an ambassador who went to nigeria to look into the possibility of trade for nuclear materials (which was also based on the fact that there was up until the first gulf war) </p>

<p>Further intelligence used to justify the war was offered by defectors from Iraq and other, less reliable sources. The bush cabinet was not privy to the information either. Every member of congress did (or could have) read all of the same information to justify voting to go into Iraq.</p>

<p>These sorts of intelligence issues do not imply a conspiracy. There was no coordination between the providers of the bad intelligence. </p>

<p>The point is, the government (the white house and congress) were out for revenge, and their emotional state, blended with faulty intelligence, muddled up their judgement (including the rest of the world save france and russia, who supported the iraq invasion).</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>I do not think 9/11 was an inside job. I think it is stupid to think that it was orchestrated in order to go into Iraq. there is a gaping disconnect in the logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no conspiracy. </p>

<p>My point is that they were in a bloodlust type state of mind. Multiple threats on the white house reported by security agencies catered to a mindset that there was a sort of all out aggression towards the USA. There were many more security concerns and intelligence reports than the public knew about [which later came to light]. </p>

<p>With the threat of further attacks and a constant fear of a mushroom cloud over a major city, they felt it practical to engage an enemy that had a nuclear weapons program - according to their reports. </p>

<p>The administration did not create the reports, and there was no coordination between the sources of the catastrophic intelligence failure.</p>

<p>Associated Press item dated May 30, 2002.</p>

<p>&quot;The morning of Sept. 11, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss were
doing what the two intelligence committee chairmen frequently do -
having breakfast together at the Capitol. With them was then-Pakistani
intelligence chief [Mahmud Ahmad]. [General Ahmad&#39;s] task was to
persuade Afghanistan&#39;s Taliban leaders to hand over terror suspect
Osama bin Laden. As the three men talked over the knotty problem, an
aide handed Goss a note saying an airplane had hit the World Trade
Center. A few moments later the Capitol would be evacuated, and the
following month [General Ahmad] was fired.&quot; </p>

<p>However, the Times also revealed that on September 11 -- while the attacks were in progress -- the two current Co-Chairmen of the Joint-Intelligence Committee investigating the 9/11 attacks, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) and Representative Porter Goss (R-FL), met for breakfast with the ISI Chief who had ordered $100,000 wired from Pakistan to terrorist leader Mohammed Atta in the days immediately preceeding the attacks.</p>

<p>According to the FBI, Indian Intelligence and several press reports, the ISI Head was instrumental in providing financial support to the 9/11 terrorists. General Mahmoud Ahmad had allegedly ordered the transfer of $100.000 to the presumed 9/11 ring-leader Mohamed Atta. </p>

<p>How fitting that this is the same House Intelligence chairman Porter Goss who was having breakfast in D.C. on 9/11 with Pakistan&#39;s security chief, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad—who was later revealed to be hijacker Mohammed Atta&#39;s bagman. </p>

<p>A Times of India (10-12-2001) story by Manoj Joshi revealed that Pakistani ISA Director-General Lt. General Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after the U.S. attacks -- confirmed by top sources in India, because of evidence produced by India showing his links to Mohammed Atta, the terrorist hijacking leader.</p>

<p>The Times said that &quot;U.S. authorities sought his [Ahmad&#39;s] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh on the instructions of ISI Lt. General Ahmad.&quot; Senior [U.S.] government sources &quot;have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden admitted meeting with the chief financier of the 9/11 hijackers in the days after September 11 after being confronted by We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski in the press room following Sunday&#39;s Democratic debate in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>According to the FBI and as confirmed by various news reports at the time, Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad instructed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the alleged assassin of Daniel Pearl, to wire $100,000 to alleged lead hijacker Mohammed Atta in the summer of 2001.</p>

<p>Arriving exactly one week before 9/11, the general met with Pentagon, White House National Security Council and CIA officials, including George Tenet and Marc Grossman, then U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.</p>

<p>On the very morning of 9/11, Ahmad was at a breakfast meeting on Capitol Hill hosted by Senator Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss, the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence committees.</p>

<p>Two days after the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon, on September 13th, Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with the ISI chief.</p>

<p>No adequate explanation has been forthcoming as to why top government and intelligence officials were meeting with the money man behind the alleged hijackers before and after 9/11.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Democratic debate had finished on Sunday, Prison Planet reporter Rudkowski was able to get access to the CNN spin room and confront presidential candidate Biden about his 9/11 meeting with the Pakistani General.</p>

<p>We asked him the question - what was he doing with the head of the Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad, said Rudkowski, he told me - he admitted that he met with him - he met with the head of the Pakistani ISI.</p>

<p>He said I told them not to do it, I told them not to wire the money - I told them to stop supporting the Taliban, which shows he had foreknowledge of them supporting him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told him - sir, he funded the hijackers, you did business with him, you let him go - he&#39;s free,&quot; said Rudkowski, to which Biden responded, &quot;Get a life kid,&quot; after which Rudkowski was pushed away by Biden&#39;s security staff.</p>

<p>What would you show a logical, rational, person to make them instantly believe the conspiracy is real. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>doesnt work like that.</p>

<p>what you&#39;re calling a &quot;logical, rational person&quot; is in fact a believer in authorities.</p>

<p>you&#39;re asking for a stronger authority in order to supplant the rulers&#39; authority in a person&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>that&#39;s not the point. The point isn&#39;t to switch to another topdog nor to follow &quot;reason&quot; because we are not creatures of reason nor objectivity : the idea that we are such creatures is an illusion as reason is just a tool and objectivity is a pipedream.</p>

<p>what you can hope to achieve is leading people to drop their belief in authority and to instead accept entertaining the possibility of contrary viewpoints being real, valid or at least fruitful to entertain in their minds.</p>

<p>this is about letting the rock of &quot;reality&quot; go which is in fact a consensus-belief, in order to navigate the waters of self-directed beliefs and examinations.</p>

<p>basically you believe in shit just because you&#39;re told to. And so do I. Are you willing to look at that, to accept it and do something about it ?</p>
