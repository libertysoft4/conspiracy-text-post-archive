        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Give me control of a Nation&#39;s money supply, and I care not who makes its laws.&quot; Mayer Amschel Rothschild</p>

<p>There is a crisis of democracy going on within Ukraine, in case you hadn&#39;t heard.  Protesters have had enough of their corrupt government.  In reaction to police brutality against student protesters (in favor of joining the E.U.), people of Ukrainian took to the street where protests escalated to the point of open conflict.  Approximately 100 protesters were killed before impeachment and charges were filed against former Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovitch.  Now, a new government has been brought into power and it deserves an equal level of scrutiny to which the ousted President was subjected to. This analysis has not taken place as of yet and I hope to put some the cards on the table with the hope that we can see where this deadly game is heading.</p>

<p>To begin, we need to examine the root cause of the protests.  Student protesters took to the streets when the President elected to not join the E.U.  This move was unpopular with the students who believed that their chances of success had been stymied by a President with greater loyalty to Russian oligarchs than to his people (though only a small fraction considered it worthy of protesting).  </p>

<p>The Russian role is relevant and also deserves some more analysis.  Russia has a vested interest in maintaining it&#39;s control of Ukraine in order to protect it&#39;s oil pipelines which criss-cross the country.  In an effort to prevent Ukraine from joining the EU, Russia raised gas prices and halted trade to try and force the matter.  It worked and the President decided to back out of the EU deal.  As a reward (the carrot), Russia agreed to purchase billions in Ukrainian bonds which functioned as a bail out for the Yanukovitch&#39;s struggling country.  </p>

<p>The E.U., cooperating with the International Monetary Fund,  offered it&#39;s own bail out, funded primarily by Germany, but it was a lot more bitter than Yanukovitch thought the people could stomach.  As with most E.U./IMF bailouts, there were a couple of strings, which looked more like ropes.  Steep austerity measures would need to be implemented, mass privatization of nationally owned industry, and steep penalties for debt-payment delay made the EU deal look more like a noose and less like a rope to grab onto.  </p>

<p>This issue of austerity plays a central but not widely discussed role in the discussion.  Likely because such debate would have to include other European countries who have agreed to the strings imposed on their loans, such as Greece.  While clearly the most glaring example, many other countries have accepted the debt relief and suffered the consequences, but because of various economic emphases, the difficulty has not been quite as stark.  The outcome of these austerity programs, whether voluntarily chosen, as in France and Spain, or by &#39;force&#39; as in Greece, has been predictably the same.  Rising unemployment from privatization causes an ever increasing burden to be placed upon the shoulders of those who can still pay taxes, causing class conflict.  Additionally, prices rise as less people are capable of spending as much as they used to, causing more layoffs, perpetuating the cycle.  </p>

<p>Yanukovitch was clearly in a difficult decision.  He understood that his country could never escape the wrath of either the EU or Russia and thus had to make a choice.  Go with the EU and face the brutal austerity measures which would alienate his base (the majority of the country). Or side with the EU, take the austerity medicine and hop on the Euro bandwagon, defying one of the strongest military powers in the world who he shared a border (and probably a couple vodka sours) with.  Putting his faith in the people who elected him, he chose to side with the Russians.</p>

<p>That mistake was unacceptable to the western bankers who make up the decision-making membership in the U.S. and E.U.  The first reason is that, as Zbigniew Brzezinski points out in his &quot;Grand Chessboard&quot;, Ukraine and specifically, the pipelines which run through it, are necessary to maintain and strengthen a &#39;unified Europe&#39;.  Brzezinski, an old political master mind and adviser to President Obama, is a realist.  He understands that a unified Europe will serve U.S. interests as their ruling elite share the same values and often times, investments, as ours.  Additionally, austerity is a serious investment on the IMF side which could yield considerable returns.  On a $12 billion investment, the interest alone creates quite a few reasons to care how this event plays out.  Also, when new Ukrainian markets become opened up in the form of privatization, as they now likely will, those with the most capital will be best positioned to scoop them up.  </p>

<p>This leads us to who has come into power.  At the top of the chain we have current interim President of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov.  A member of the All Ukrainian &#39;Fatherland&#39; Party and former head of the agitation and propaganda division of the Communist Youth Party, his latest position was as head of the Ukrainian Security Service. Wikileaks has implicated Turchynov is the destruction of documents regarding illegal activity of the former PM Yulia Tymoshenko&#39;s connections to organized crime.  </p>

<p>He shares power with his interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, also a member of the Fatherland Party and former Foreign Minister and Minister of the Economy.  These are exactly the type of credentials that made him popular with western bankers as well as the U.S. State Department who labeled him as their &#39;go to man&#39; in a recently released USSD phone call.  Yatsenyuk, in a brief, off the cuff interview with BBC said that &quot;Ukrainians are going to have to deal with some very unpopular policies soon&quot; which will be for their own good.  This is his warning about the coming austerity which will happen as soon as government functions are turned over completely.</p>

<p>A recent article from the Washington Post had this to say regarding further selections of Parliamentarians and cabinet members: &quot;A Maidan council has been established by a group of prominent activists to consult on ministerial choices. It wants to veto any candidate who is rich, who worked for Yanukovych or who was involved in human rights abuses.&quot;  If these demands are considered, it could certainly create some major headaches for the new officials. </p>

<p>I will periodically update this post as more information becomes available regarding choices for leadership positions.  One name to keep and eye on is Yulia Tymoshenko, former Prime Minister and at one point the wealthiest woman in Ukraine.  The former &quot;Oil Princess&quot;, a nickname given to her during her time as CEO of the largest private oil company in the country, is currently seeking medical attention in Germany.  To don my tin foil hat for a moment, it is likely that she is also there working with the German bankers (and probably others) on ways to sell austerity to an already skeptical public.  One that doesn&#39;t take kindly to the wealthy exerting their undo influence.  But Tymoshenko enjoys widespread popularity in the Ukraine and might be the only person who could bring about exactly what the western bankers are hoping for.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really doubt it.  There are reports coming out of the Southern region of the country which suggest that Russian troops are moving with relative impunity.  The Russians still enjoy large popular support in the South and East (region closest to Russia) which give them a strong motivation and almost an &#39;electoral mandate&#39; to intervene. 
EDIT for spelling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add to your analyzes is that Ukraine is still a heavily state dependent country, without a competitive market economy, and heavily relies on exports to Russia and its satellites. Pensions are a fraction of what is offered in the EU as are salaries for most public workers. Subsidies (specially gas-heating) are what is keeping the system afloat. </p>

<p>Once subsidies are cut-off the population will suffer tremendously as did Greece, but maybe worse.  Unemployment will sky-rocket as will the basic living costs.</p>
