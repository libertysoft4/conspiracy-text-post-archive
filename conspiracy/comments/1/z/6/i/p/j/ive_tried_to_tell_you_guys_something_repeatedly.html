<p>All of these events have one thing in common, removing God, morality and the protection of life in all forms from our world. America was a threat because of separation of church and state. Now, godlessness and immorality are the norm. Science has become the new religion, ever distancing you from the mystery of faith. Science and history actually prove we have an Intelligent Creator. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no aliens that are coming to save or enslave you. There&#39;s no movement among the people that will unite us without the hand of God. Use your mind, not just your brain. Listen to your soul, not just your heart. You&#39;re indoctrinated on so many levels. Peel back the layers. Look at the hate, the murder, the greed. Look at the power grabs. Look at why Israel stands to gain from all of us denouncing Christianity. Look at your own quest for truth and living authentically. </p>

<p>No one created the &quot;rumor&quot; of Christ. People didn&#39;t willingly lay down their lives for the Bible to be a bunch of lies. The majority of you haven&#39;t even studied the Bible! </p>

<p>Know why Muslims are the current &quot;terrorists&quot;, because they believe in the same God as Christians. Know why we went after the Asians? Because of modern medicine, the disintegrating family values and their technology. Re read history. Re read the Bible. Re read spiritual books. ITS ALL THERE.  </p>

<p>Actually they really did.  Most of the New Testament is written so that Jesus of Nazareth (who had been dead for almost 100 years at this point) magically fit into all the Old Testament prophecies.   You might also ask yourself why different Christian bibles throughout the world have different numbers of books and and new ones entirely.  Ever hear of the Gospel of Judah where he claims Jesus planned his death the whole time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, the council of Nicea was a unity conference. There was early debate (from the moment Jesus ascended into heaven) about many, many aspects. Like the Gentile or Jew debate, did Christ fully intend to save all peoples of the world? The Nicene Creed was &quot;invented&quot; using text from the Gospels to unify in purpose, thought and action, because of the way texts were scattered throughout the lands. The New Testament were literally letters to churches, there needed to be an official gathering and organization of texts. </p>

<p>Try actually reading and studying the Bible with an open mind. Many, many here dismiss it, based on negative experiences when an adolescent, then use some YouTube video as their Bible! I can&#39;t say if I don&#39;t like or trust something or someone, based on rumors. You&#39;re in this sub, because you&#39;re a truth seeker, correct? Seek deeper knowledge of subjects, don&#39;t just reject God and the Bible because of the very active propaganda. I&#39;m convinced FoxNews and the Tea Party is a CIA con game, to bastardize the message of Christ. Jesus would never have clung to guns or preached one class of citizens was <em>Right</em>. He would have renounced all this infighting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is a plagiarization, rebranding and re-scripting of the ancient mystery schools, bud.  It&#39;s all Pagan myth and astrotheology.  Whatever hint of truth there is was lost long ago.  Still, a lot can be learned from the various teachings, yes.     </p>

<p>I agree with you (and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGpoEPcmOK4">SOAD</a> for that matter) that there is something of value in having faith, a moral code and getting in touch with our spirituality, but let&#39;s not go trusting a book that has been re-written in countless languages over thousands of years by untrustworthy authors like Josephus Piso.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People didn&#39;t willingly lay down their lives for the Bible to be a bunch of lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, they did exactly that -only they <em>believed</em> the Bible to be true.  However, the Bible is NOT a credible source of historical events.  It&#39;s more revealing to study the history of its authors, their commissioners and the relationship these monotheistic religions, originating in steller cult worship, have with royal monarchies and secret societies.</p>

Just rather except some made up shit and follow it blindly. Why do you denounce science?

But no, you&#39;d rather not think for yourself and just accept some unproven bull. Then on top of that you try to push it on to everyone around you.

    <div class="md"><p>If he understood the teachings of Jesus, no &quot;Christian&quot; would accept any spiritual authority from pope, pastor, minister, deacon, or what have you.  Jesus&#39; message was that you are one with the divine. But no Christian today is taught that or believes it, except for a few people on the fringes who are labeled as heretics. </p>

<p>So, I agree with you in one sense, that we do have to go back to God, meaning we need to realize our oneness with the divine. Once you do that, you don&#39;t want to lie, cheat, steal, or hurt anyone. I do not agree that we need to zealously readopt the doctrine of some church back into our lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Gospel of Saint John shows it. I strongly recommend you listen to this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY28PJZY5eo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY28PJZY5eo</a></p>

<p>The whole thing is great but it gets into Christianity at 21:21.</p>

<p>To Jesus, the church is the community, not the expensive building and the clerical hierarchy. The living Christ is the shepherd of the flock, not the pope. Jesus&#39; disciples were poor fishermen, not scholars, not rabbis. This is sad in a way since the disciples, except perhaps for John, seemed to miss the point of what Jesus was saying.</p>

<p>Read Matthew 10, as well. 10:34-39 especially demand a personal devotion to Christ, with no middle man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Respectfully, Jesus chose the disciples and especially Peter for a reason. Look how many times Peter is referenced in the Gospels. He wanted some &quot;authority&quot;, knowing the witnesses were most important in spreading the word of God. The Catholic church believes they have preserved the priesthood reestablished by Christ. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not here to argue between denominations. I fully believe my faith has grown, having a church structure and a parish. I need to feel a &quot;part of&quot; something greater than myself, I need to be around those that strive to do good works. I suspect you probably do too, because you&#39;re human and because you&#39;re here. There&#39;s many lost sheep here who don&#39;t even realize they&#39;re in the church of reddit!</p>

<p>Watch the movie Agora also.</p>

<p>And I am sure everyone here had some misguided parent or grandparent that force fed that propaganda throughout their childhood. Praise to those who with wisdom threw that blasphemous rag away. This world can not see soon enough the destruction of that mindset which bows and kneels to the false god of Abraham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made a huge display of pride in your OP. Enjoy that mote removal from your eye. Pride in your experience. Pride in the propagandistic writings of Josephus. Pride in your false religion. Pride in standing on the mountain and declaring the law. Like all Sociopathic Christians you pridefully believe you may dictate the doings of other men. Your OP is not a testament of humility, but that of a man suffering the very psychosis of a dictator.</p>

<p>The people would be far more enriched studying science, math, and engineering and leaving that barbaric religion in the dustbin of history. </p>

<p>Take your bible and shove it up your ass. Your dictates and misplaced pride are proof of its ill effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I&#39;m proud. I&#39;ve been to hell and back. You&#39;ll see. Even the proud learn humility. You&#39;ve rejected that which you haven&#39;t taken the time to investigate, never questioning who&#39;s agenda it is to turn you away from God. He&#39;s been waiting for you. Go see if you have the strength to be disciplined. It&#39;s never been about punishment, its always always been about love. you always have the choice, he gave you a brain for a reason, use it. </p>
