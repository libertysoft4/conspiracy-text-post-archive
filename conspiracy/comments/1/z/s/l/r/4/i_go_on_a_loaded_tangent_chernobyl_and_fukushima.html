<p>That would be for land based life. What about oceanic ecosystems?</p>

<p>Is there an angle here? Could it be some sort of provoked opportunity? As in, &quot;what would really happen after a nuclear holocaust?&quot; Will life find a way to prosper? Chernobyl offers a resounding yes! but what about oceanic life?</p>

<p>Can it possibly be a/the motive for the cover up of the Fukushima event?</p>

<li>The alleged 9.0 earthquake that hit Japan on March 11, 2011, was NOT a 9.0 magnitude event!</li>
</ol>

<p>The real and highest values of the 3/11 earthquake in Japan are:</p>

<pre><code>7.0 in magnitude
6.67 (maximum) in intensity
</code></pre>

<p>The real 7.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011, can be and has already been proven based on witness accounts, official maps/charts and specialized investigations.</p>

<li>There never was any “accident” at Fukushima as defined in official narratives and media reporting, the entire chain of events concerns acts of war and sabotage and eco-terrorism!</li>

<p>From the earthquake that triggered the tsunami and therefore the tsunami itself, to the exploding nuclear reactors and the spreading of disinformation, it’s all part of the (eco-) terror, the deception and the blackmail aimed at Japan and the rest of the world.</p>

<li>Strong evidence exists of multiple Israeli connections to the whole 3/11 chain of events!</li>
</ol>

<p>The US-Israeli Stuxnet virus was detected in Japan as early as July 2010. The Siemens SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system, as used in Fukushima, Japan, is the original target that Stuxnet was designed to attack.</p>

<p>The Israeli “security” firm Magna BSP was (and still is) in charge of the security at multiple nuclear sites in Japan, including the Fukushima nuclear power plants. Their unique connections to the Israeli Mossad and Homeland Security, in combination with their more than questionable or even suspicious behavior, techniques and equipment bring up more than just one reason to assume active sabotage from their side too.</p>

<p>Also, Israel’s organized crime syndicate, or mafia, has been linked to the cleanup in Fukushima, Japan, whereby homeless people are being deployed because they are deemed disposable and expendable.</p>

<li>Evidence proves that earthquakes and tsunamis can be triggered on purpose!</li>
</ol>

<p>This evidence is not only based on former US Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen’s statement during a military briefing in 1997 regarding his definition of eco-terrorism, nor is this evidence based solely on the proven existence of devices such as tsunami bombs. In fact, this evidence is based on the two previous mentioned cases and facts as well as on other proven cases, such as in Mexico, where a planned earthquake simulation in 2012 suddenly went live, as if the earthquake was created and delivered on demand.</p>

<li>Practices during the nuclear cleanup at Fukushima and other parts of Japan raise questions!</li>
</ol>

<p>The reasons that these questions emerge are because of the fact that:</p>

<pre><code>At least 50,000 people have been deployed of which at least 800 have already died

People are being threatened to keep silent about the truth regarding the cleanup

20 major contractors such as the Obayashi Corporation, the Taisei Corporation, Aisogo Service, Kajima Corp and Shimizu Corp  and 56 subcontractors are involved in the very loosely regulated cleanup efforts

A total of at least 733 companies are involved in the cleanup

The Japanese mafia (which has been linked to the Israeli mafia) – including Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi-kai and Inagawa-kai – is involved in the decontamination of the nuclear hotspots and in the death threats towards the homeless and exploited workers

<p>Evidence? Ha! If this were a court of law, that&#39;s all be dismissed!</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t say in the rules that everyone has to agree all the time. Remember, &quot;keep an open mind&quot;. You could be wrong.</p>

<p>...by trusting random people on the internet who don&#39;t understand physics. Gotcha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you dismiss the content?  You are not rebutting any claims made about the sabotage at fukushima . . . you attack the validity without providing any resources to backup your harsh dismissal of this gathered evidence. 
What is your opinion on Stuxnet?  </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy reddit, you&#39;re implying I&#39;m ignorant by laughing and warning others not to trust random people on the internet.</p>

<p>Your word is your bond, and it is you tft2 that is a random person who should not be trusted.  </p>

No. Well, same with this 311truth crap. All I can say is it&#39;s not physically possible what is being claimed. Maybe you should read a couple physics books?</p>

<p>Stuxnet was used to attack the Siemens scada controllers used at the plant, and it wouldn&#39;t be the first time ISRAEL had attacked nuclear facilities with a virus (Iran comes to mind), or with bombs (operation opera) on Iraq.  Do you dispute this?  What about Operation Orchard on Syria do you reckon that none of these events occurred? </p>

<p>Do you not find it strange that an Israeli firm was contracted to provide security at Fukushima-Daiichi and then that facility blows up on the symbolically falseflaggish date of 3/11?  What other entity has a pattern of illicit strikes on nuclear facilities?????????  </p>

<p>You have not added anything to this discussion, so far you have only detracted from this discourse.  This is a conspiracy subreddit meant to discuss conspiracies, not put down ideas because you supposedly hold several relevant degrees.  </p>

<p>Literally the definition of a coincidence. And were you serious with the &quot;falseflaggish&quot; part? I really hope not.</p>

<p>Discussion is discussion. We can disagree and it&#39;s fine. That&#39;s why this is a message board and not just a read-only site.</p>
