&quot;WASHINGTON — The crisis in Crimea is heralding the rise of a new era of American energy diplomacy, as the Obama administration tries to deploy the vast new supply of natural gas in the United States as a weapon to undercut the influence of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over Ukraine and Europe.</p>

<p>The crisis has escalated a State Department initiative to use a new boom in American natural gas supplies as a lever against Russia, which supplies 60 percent of Ukraine’s natural gas and has a history of cutting off the supply during conflicts. This week, Gazprom, Russia’s state-run natural gas company, said it would no longer provide gas at a discount rate to Ukraine, a move reminiscent of more serious Russian cutoffs of natural gas to Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe in 2006, 2008 and 2009.

<p>The administration’s strategy is to move aggressively to deploy the advantages of its new resources to undercut Russian natural gas sales to Ukraine and Europe, weakening such moves by Mr. Putin in future years. Although Russia is still the world’s biggest exporter of natural gas, the United States recently surpassed it to become the world’s largest natural gas producer, largely because of breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing technology, known as fracking.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that with really high gas prices these LNG terminals delivered by tanker might become much more viable.  This could really jump start this industry so it would happen soon than later.  So someone makes a shit load of money with futures and then in a reduced period of time they will make a shit load on LNG.  Coincidentally the US has a staggering amount of the stuff and the only thing stopping it from being delivered to Europe is precedence.  In any scenario Russia comes out looking like some sort of aggressive creature, Europe is disrupted and the US emerges as an energy exporter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that the US is in some very significant ways responsible for the uprising in the Ukraine (see; <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1ghhi/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=861DJLR4Cek">here</a>, I&#39;d say Russia is entirely justified in protecting their interests in Crimea, and helping the south and eastern regions of the Ukraine who support Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sorry, but this and every other conflict is not always about gas and oil.  That is a cop out for people who don&#39;t pay attention to the world until somewhere flashes over, then they look and say &quot;so and so land has oil or gas or whatever&quot;  That must be it.  You know what Ukraine has that America wants and Russia hates?  The American European missile shield.  This is a chance for Putin to punch a hole in the shield, repatriate Ukraine and maybe gain some intel on how the shield is laid out.  But you go ahead and assume it is for oil, gas or whatever else you feel is right.  </p>

<p>&quot;Ukraine: Unexpected Oil Find, Major Gas Interest

<p>Bottom Line: We see a flurry of activity in Ukraine, with a $735 million Black Sea commitment by Exxon, an unexpected 100 million barrel oil find in the Poltava region and new estimates that the country could achieve annual gas production of 45 billion cubic meters by 2020.</p>

<p>Analysis: First, Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas company Naftogaz on 11 July announced the discovery of an oil field in the eastern/central Poltava region that reportedly contains some 13 million tons of oil, or 100 million barrels of oil. This is the biggest oil find in Ukraine in a decade and a half. The Budishchansko-Chutovskoye oil field is fully owned by Naftogaz, and is the only field fully owned by the state-run company. </p>

<p>The news for Ukraine gets even better this week, though. Exxon Mobil Corp is ready to invest $735 million to drill two deep-water wells offshore Ukraine in the Black Sea ($335 million in a signing bonus for the government and a $400 million commitment for seismic surveys and drilling). This is an amazing show of confidence by Exxon in Ukraine’s Black Sea.</p>

<p>Finally, ExxonMobil has given Ukraine another public boost with a new estimate that the country’s onshore and offshore gas reserves could help it reach production of 45 billion cubic meters by 2020.</p>

<p>Recommendation: We suggest very closely monitoring Exxon’s progress as it prepares to explore in Ukraine’s Black Sea, in the deep marine Skifiske gas field. (Right… &quot;</p>
