    <div class="md"><p>The ACA originally surfaced as the Heritage Plan in 1989. It was introduced by conservatives and included the mandate.</p>

<p>The Republican party has spent most of its energy trying to defeat Obamacare, which they originated.</p>

<p>Sooner of later people will come to their senses and realize that single payer healthcare is the most affordable and efficient system in use.</p>

<p>Maybe then we wont have the 37th best healthcare system in the world. Good affordable healthcare is important for a healthy economy.</p>

<p>If we can afford to bomb Syria, we can afford to care for our citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a matter fact it is a constitutional thing. What entity can determine how or what kind of insurance I get? Its bullshit. Leave it the private sector.

    <div class="md"><p>You say it&#39;s a &quot;constitutional thing.&quot;  I say if it is, it is so far from what should be our highest-priority &quot;constitutional thing&quot; that to protest it is dumb.

<p>If you want to talk about losing constitutional rights, pick a good example, not a marginal example that you have to argue the truth off (Obamacare).</p>

<p>Violations of our IVth ammendment rights are absolutely clear and plain as day.    There is nothing to discuss in terms of the facts.</p>

<p>The suppose conflict between Obamacare and the constitution is only clear to loud angry men with red faces who count themselves on the Republican-Libertarian spectrum of thought.  I.e., it&#39;s not clear and plain as day.  It&#39;s what&#39;s called &quot;arguable.&quot;</p>

<p>I realize that YOU asserted that the conflict is a &quot;matter of fact.&quot;  Well, that tells me about you, not about the facts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious as to which part of the Affordable Care Act these people are against? 
(Please read the Wiki article on the topic)
Is it:
Guaranteed issue prohibits insurers from denying coverage to individuals regardless of pre-existing conditions.
or
A partial community rating requires insurers to offer the same premium to all applicants of the same age and geographical location without regard to gender or most pre-existing conditions.
or
Minimum standards for health insurance policies are established.
or
An individual mandate requires all individuals not covered by an employer sponsored health plan, Medicaid, Medicare or other public insurance programs (such as Tricare) to secure an approved private-insurance policy or pay a penalty unless the applicable individual is a member of a recognized religious sect exempted by the Internal Revenue Service or has a financial hardship (This is so everybody contributes except of course all the religious hypocrites that will file for exemption and push the costs onto others, when they go to the emergency room for assistance without insurance).
or
Health insurance exchanges will commence operation in every state. Each exchange will serve as an online marketplace where individuals and small businesses can compare policies and buy insurance (with a government subsidy if eligible).
or
Low-income individuals and families whose income is above 100% and up to 400% of the federal poverty level will receive federal subsidies on a sliding scale if they purchase insurance via an exchange. Those from 133% to 150% of the poverty level will be subsidized such that their premium costs will be 3% to 4% of income. In 2013, the subsidy would apply for incomes up to $45,960 for an individual or $94,200 for a family of four; consumers can choose to receive their tax credits in advance, and the exchange will send the money directly to the insurer every month.[32] Small businesses will also be eligible for subsidies.
Medicaid eligibility is expanded to include individuals and families with incomes up to 133% of the poverty level, and the CHIP enrollment process is simplified. However, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court effectively ruled that states may opt-out of the Medicaid expansion, and several have done so.
or
Reforms to the Medicare payment system are meant to promote greater efficiency in the healthcare delivery system by restructuring Medicare reimbursements from fee-for-service to bundled payments. Under the new payment system, a single payment is paid to a hospital and a physician group for a defined episode of care (such as a hip replacement) rather than individual payments to individual service-providers.
or
Firms employing 50 or more people but not offering health insurance will also pay a shared responsibility requirement if the government has had to subsidize an employee&#39;s healthcare, usually through tax deductions. This is commonly known as the employer mandate.</p>

<p>Most likely people have been sold the story about businesses shouldering the burden. Businesses have a responsibility to the citizens of this country to provide a safe work environment and improve the quality of life of our citizens. The time for blind greed is over, for the good of all people in this country.</p>

<p>You know, they forced the citizens to accept uneducated blacks voting.</p>

<p>They forced the citizens to accept women voting.</p>

<p>They forced the citizens to accept prohibition - and then repealed it.</p>

<p>They forced <em>lots</em> of things into the system, and not all of them were for the good of the people.</p>

<p>You establish a system, the best you can, then you tweak it until it works for as many citizens as possible while harming the least number possible.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A universal healthcare system is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>It will never evolve on its own, because too many players are competing and colluding.</p></li>
<li><p>Force a policy into place, tweak it. If it fails, repeal it. It&#39;s that fucking simple. Just like prohibition.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>how is giving a man the right to vote and forcing a man to pay a large percentage of his already heavily taxed income toward a health care system he would rather not have (and the policy will probably loop-hole it&#39;s way right out of paying that cancer treatment bill when the time comes but that&#39;s neither here nor there) in the same ballpark?  You say forcing the policy is the key, like there heroes on one side of the issue who are battling to help the lower class.  That is not how I see it.  I see the game they are playing as 
1.  Human has toy rope
2.  Dog plays tug of war and they struggle
3.  Each time dog lets go a little to get a better grip, human takes more rope until his hand is virtually in dog&#39;s mouth.  Dog could bite human but has been trained to never do that.  Dog has no chance unless human shows mercy.<br/>
(You are thinking they are like the kind human owner who shows mercy)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to be honest, I haven&#39;t read it. I too would like to know what they are against however after reading your post I wonder why anyone would WANT government subsidies? I think we should have less government interference not more... I realize the intention is good but passing laws is not the way it should be done in my opinion. This is what creates a police state and removes liberties.  Businesses have a responsibility to improve the quality of life? You almost had me there. lol. Work is a barter of skill for money. That is all. If an educated public finds sub-par working conditions they will not engage in a barter, there by forcing the employer to make necessary corrections to attract employees. Society should dictate this, not the government. Problem is were surrounded by idiots and in turn have legislated our way into slavery. </p>
