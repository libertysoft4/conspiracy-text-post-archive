<p>excerpt from washington post/business...</p>

<p>Booz Allen, based in Tysons Corner, has been a local fixture for years, employing thousands and providing management and consulting services to the government, particularly the defense and intelligence agencies. It even sponsored a local golf tournament — the Booz Allen Classic — between 2004 and 2006. It also became a leader among the contractors supplying tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to the government in recent years, including technologists such as Snowden.
Those government contracts, and thousands more like them, in 2008 made Booz Allen a ripe acquisition target for Carlyle. It paid $2.54 billion for Booz Allen as a deep recession took hold. Fearing the risks of taking on too much debt in the midst of a financial crisis, Carlyle put up 50 percent cash instead of its normal 30 percent. It borrowed the rest to buy the company, which was then privately held.</p>

<p>Upon the close of the deal, the less profitable international and commercial business was spun off to become Booz &amp; Co., leaving Carlyle with a government-only company. After the split, the new Booz Allen Hamilton established an incentive-based compensation structure that gave the remaining partners a stake in the firm’s success. In effect, said one person close to the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly, “you got to eat what you killed.” </p>

<hr/>

<p>excerpt from the guardian june 10, 2013...by julian borger...
The current of director of national intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, who issued a stinging attack on the intelligence leaks this weekend, is a former Booz Allen executive. The firm&#39;s current vice-chairman, Mike McConnell, was DNI under the George W Bush administration. He worked for the Virginia-based company before taking the job, and returned to the firm after leaving it. The company website says McConnell is responsible for its &quot;rapidly expanding cyber business&quot;.</p>

<p>James Woolsey, a former CIA director was also a Booz Allen vice-president, and Melissa Hathaway, another former company executive also once worked as the top aide on cybersecurity to McConnell when he was DNI. The company headquarters in the leafy Washington suburb of McLean in northern Virginia, close to CIA headquarters and home to former and current intelligence officers.</p>

<p>Snowden&#39;s decision to reveal his identity as a computer systems administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, directly handling National Security Agency IT systems, raises significant image problems for the $6bn company and its 25,000-strong staff, which has traded on a bond of trust with sensitive clients, particularly the intelligence establishment. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>and for those that may have forgotten: On the morning of 9/11/2001 GHW Bush was at a Carlyle Group meeting in a DC hotel with a close friend of the family--one of the bin Ladens...
wonder how much money the Bushes, the Cheneys, the Clappers (etc, etc, etc) have made off of the private defense/intell companies that they pump and milk the U.S. Gov&#39;t for...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Due to the fact that there were several whistleblowers before Snowden who were unceremoniously ignored, I too had some misgivings about his legitimacy.. but not anymore.</p>

<p>The thing is, no matter who your boogeymen are, they&#39;re not immune to unfettered electronic surveillance. The popularity of Snowden is likely the result of extremely powerful people who oppose it. Think about it.. how can anyone conduct a conspiracy if there&#39;s no fucking way to do it without some other group listening in? What if somebody listens to the group that thinks they&#39;re on top? Anyhow.. you get the idea.</p>

<p>TPTB want it gone, and it will be gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another point to remember is that if he&#39;s releasing legit info that is of concern, then media coverage is required to do damage control.  If what he says gets packaged in a more friendly manner, or the different issues he discusses are cherry-picked to draw attention away from the dangerous bits, that&#39;s all a part of a management strategy.</p>

<p>I am untrusting too, and I consider that Snowden&#39;s motivations are perhaps more personal than simply &quot;the good of the people&quot;.  Something specific soured him on the whole system, it would seem to me.  Perhaps he received threats before his exit, that actually prompted him to do all of this out of concern for his personal safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible, but I believe it is highly unlikely. Snowden had access to procedures, regulations and the organisation of the surveillance state. I believe he hadn&#39;t access to Black Operations. He probably wouldn&#39;t have access to files about 9/11. I believe, <em>if</em> there was any complicity of the government, most of the evidence for this complicity will already be purged from the files.</p>

<p>But there is a real possibility that there are areas where 9/11 and the surveillance state overlap:</p>

<p>In the past potential subversives and potential whistleblowers who could become a threat to the state have become victims of targeted spying. It is well know, that this happened to communists, peace-activists, civil rights activists, the Black Panthers, native american groups. But it also happened to various JFK-researchers.</p>

<p>Listen for example to broadcast: <em>Mae Brussell - FBI &amp; CIA vs. Warren Report Critics- (6-27-77)</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-TNlFSW9Sk&amp;amp;list=PLA3AE1666479EF849">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-TNlFSW9Sk&amp;amp;list=PLA3AE1666479EF849</a></p>

<p>Zachary Sklar, who was the editor for Jim Garrison&#39;s book <em>On the trail of the assassins</em> was on BlackOpRadio where he talked about the kind of attacks Garrison faced (Show 38 from 2001 - scroll down). <a href="http://www.blackopradio.com/favorite.html">http://www.blackopradio.com/favorite.html</a></p>

<p>Or read what happened to Peter Lemkin:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/29445-peter-lemkin-a-casualty-of-jfk-s-assassination.html">http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/29445-peter-lemkin-a-casualty-of-jfk-s-assassination.html</a></p>

<p>So I believe that it is possible, that there could be similar to the <em>No Fly List</em> a special list which is related to 9/11. Such a list would have the names of people on it who are either privy to classified information about 9/11, or are looking into 9/11 as researchers. Those people will be surveilled more intensively, than the average citizen.</p>

<p>According to Kevin Ryan and an unsourced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Inquiry_into_Intelligence_Community_Activities_before_and_after_the_Terrorist_Attacks_of_September_11,_2001#Media_involvement">Wikipedia</a> article, members of the <em>Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11</em> were targeted by FBI surveillance.</p>

<p>Recently both co-chairs of the 9/11 commission have gone public. In the article <em>It&#39;s time to debate NSA program</em>, they wrote their concerns. The article contains no hint, that Keane and Hamilton have themselves been targeted by the surveillance state, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...personally, i don&#39;t think most &quot;involved&quot; had to know the endgame -- they had to merely follow orders. For example, why were the flights not intercepted by military craft (as they had been over 70 times in the nine months prior to those events: concerning lost transponder signals or variations on a flightpath)? Those who did not act were not necessarily in collusion, as such, they were simply directed away from the key planes, or not put in the air at all. War games produced the necessary cover to overlay another operation even as most were doing their duties responsibly.</p>

<p>The official (conspiracy) theory has very few involved; so i see no reason why government/military involvement must involve countless hordes. </p>

<p>Mistakes are inevitable -- so there is always hope that something/someone would surface. Cognitive dissonance seems a greater obstacle to overcome even when tangible questions are raised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...fair enough; it&#39;s a logical conclusion to make, no doubt.</p>

<p>I agree that some technology was used to bring down the buildings. 10 floors per second makes no sense to me -- and the buildings are decimated, virtually liquified into waves of powder. So where is the weight that crushed the floors below?</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that some technology was involved that standard demolition crews do not use. The evidence for nano-thermite is strong. But who knows what particulars were employed? Again, it&#39;s conceivable that workers applied tech that had a purpose beyond what they were told.</p>

<p>And the meta-event was planned long ago; so preparations were likely ongoing for a long time. People follow orders. They don&#39;t question a process, particularly if they are being paid big bucks to quietly complete a task. i still hold hope for something to surface -- however likely or not.</p>

<p>Another: the planes involved were equipped with drone tech that over-rode the pilots actions. And from then on, no one on board the flights was in control. The highjackers could have been patsies, thinking they were involved in a drill. </p>

<p>Control centre for the mission is not clear to me; your supposition may be right, though 7 came down at 5:20pm so that&#39;s a long time to have the crew sitting in waiting.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve wondered this.  When it came out that the NSA was spying on love interests and no one really did anything, I concluded that leaks about the NSA will not launch a revolution.  So why not drop some serious info that will kick start change?  Because he doesn&#39;t have anything that juicy?  Because he doesn&#39;t want to incite chaos?  Check out <a href="http://stormcloudsgathering.com/revolution-an-instruction-manual">this video</a> for a possible explanation, revolution has to grow properly...can&#39;t just explode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to have my doubts about Snowden and his <em>Tune in next week for more &quot;The Snowden Leaks&quot;!</em></p>

<p>WTF is up with this. If he has information critical to the wellbeing of you, I, and the rest of America, he should data-dump this shit and let the world deal with it. This jerking around, little bits here and there, just enough to keep everyone feeling dejected, controlled, monitored, and most importantly-- glued to their TV and computer monitor-- are making me think more and more with each passing day that this is nothing more than a con, a huge con, a psycho-informational 9/11.</p>

<p>Honestly, what has resulted from this? Nothing. Not a fucking thing. No arrests. No actual investigations beyond journalistic. </p>

<p><em>Yes, we are lying to you. Yes, we are tracking you. Yes, we are illegally storing everything you do, say, buy, and talk about. Yes, it is illegal. Illegal as fuck. We are still here. We are still here. We are still here, still doing it. We are still here. We are still here.</em></p>

<p>What do TPTB want more than anything right now? To condition us, condition us toward the way of existence that they have chosen for us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s working.</p>

<p>2.) In the past, they always denied leaks as false, including domestic wiretapping by many whistleblowers.  </p>

<p>3.) MSM and Government confirmed that the Snowden leaks are true whereas they always denied similar leaks before.</p>

<p>4.) Since they haven&#39;t been able to censor the internet without backlash, they decided to &quot;let people know&quot; that the government is watching everything they do (an implied warning to stay in line).   People will self-censor government criticism out of fear of being labeled a terrorist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyhong presented by the 9/11 truth movement is a lie.  For your particular question, I can answer it simply. The government can&#39;t keep secrets! If there was any evidence that supported the idea that Bush was responsible for 9/11 it would have gotten out. You know how big of an operation it would of been? It would of gone well past Bush&#39;s cabinet members. Also, you can look at any u.s. administration ever and they all have there leaks. Now matter how big or small they all get out. Most notably Watergate, Iran Contra, the recent NSA scandal and of course Bill Clinton&#39;s stain on a dress.</p>

<p>This is completely untrue. There is a deep and rich history of vast power abuses being kept secret for decades. Operation Gladio, the Phoenix Program, etc. When certain things are found out, the documents are destroyed before being made public. MK ULTRA, Operation CHAOS etc.</p>

<p>Consider this. The US is currently under 30 states of emergency and has the Continuity of Operations shadow government in effect. But NO ONE in the mainstream talks about it! THATS how good they are at keeping secrets: even then they are out in the open, they are secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here we go with the mindless generalizations from the dipshit that probably doesn&#39;t know anything about the Bush family.  GHWB ran the CIA, in case you didn&#39;t know.  He was also a CIA asset when he was working for &quot;Zapta Oil&quot; when Kennedy was killed.  He was in Dallas, but he has lied about it numerous times, switching stories from working overseas and Houston, TX, and most recently deciding he &quot;does not remember&quot; where he was that day (Which was the &#39;9/11 moment&#39; of the baby boomer generation).  How about Poppy Bush&#39;s closest friend and business partner, Allen Dulles, who was fired from head of the CIA, by JFK, after the Bay of Pigs episode?  Ever since Prescott Bush&#39;s dealings on Wall Street, they have been a family deeply ingrained in the American elite culture.  They aren&#39;t just some random-ass political family.<br/>
Bush Jr though?  He&#39;s not a master mind, as we all know.  He&#39;s not even a good liar, I don&#39;t think.  He barely made it into Yale, and he almost didn&#39;t get tapped for Skull &amp; Bones, the &#39;secret society&#39; fraternity at Yale that John Kerry also was a member of at almost the exact same time.  He&#39;s never been particular spectacular.  He&#39;s not much more than his father&#39;s son, to put it simply.  </p>

<p>People tend to be extremely elaborate with 9/11, acting like it is some crazy executed plan involving the highest levels of government.  That&#39;s not what it was at all, I would bet.
For all we know, the terrorists who took down those planes were probably none-the-wiser to what they were really doing(by that I mean in the &quot;big picture&quot;, they certainly knew they were flying planes into skyscrapers).  They were probably just patsies that thought they were martyrs for Al-Qaeda, which I&#39;m sure they were to most radical Islamists.  But do not forget, we created the Mujahideen in the 1980s through the CIA.  The Saudis were our most valued satellite in the Middle East at the time(and I would venture to say they still are at the end of the day), and Osama Bin Laden, who is from a very wealthy Saudi family, led the newly created group of &quot;freedom fighters&quot;.  Which is exactly what they were called when Al-Qaeda was fighting the Soviets.  </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>  The CIA does not fuck around.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The recent NSA scandal has been going on for a very long time. It takes time for the truth to come out. As for 911 I originally said the same thing that the group involved would have to be massive and in turn couldn&#39;t be covered up. I guess I still believe that but the idea that the bush administration ignored info and allowed it to happen is completely possible. With the info we have now and the deception about Iraq I would actually say it is probable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to say. But the CIA sure knew but I don&#39;t think they really speak to each other. If it was an inside job they probably made sure the NSA didn&#39;t know about it or at least painted a false picture for them. Most of the info was probably in Cheney&#39;s multiple man sized safes. </p>
