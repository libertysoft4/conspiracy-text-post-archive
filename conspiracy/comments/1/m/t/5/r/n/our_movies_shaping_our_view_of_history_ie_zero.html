<p>Dark Knight Rises vilifies the 99%.</p>

<p>The new James Bond vilifies hackers who expose government secrets.</p>

<p>Hollywood is all about propaganda and distorting reality...</p>

<p>Right now Hollywood&#39;s movie trend is post apocalyptic and zombie revolution type movies. I suspect they are doing this to brainwash people into believing that a &quot;revolution&quot; only occurs with chaos and destruction. </p>

<p>Hollywood doesn&#39;t want the US citizens to realize that humanity is in the midst of a revolution. US citizens right now have all the necessary communication networks to organize on a massive scale and demand changes in their government. Hollywood is painting a false picture of the revolution in order to create passive Americans. </p>

<p>The current revolution ends when the American mind is closed and Hollywood is about to accomplish this.</p>

<p>An entity has a lot of power if it can distort reality and make money at the same time. This is why Hollywood is so powerful. Music, TV, Movies. They were behind SOPA / PIPA. They are ones imposing surveillance with a 6 strike policies on the citizens of the US. MPAA and Chris Dodd is their proxy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just look through the films that win Oscars.</p>

<p>Argo.  A movie that depicts how plucky Americans can defeat the odds against those evil Iranians, just as America is considering whether it should attack Iran.</p>

<p>The Hurt Locker.  Because of course the poster frame of the Iraq War should be about depicting Americans <em>defusing</em> bombs in Iraq.</p>

<p>The Social Network.  He didn&#39;t lie, cheat and steal to build Facebook.  Jews are just smarter.</p>

<p>Traffic.  I know, let&#39;s take the excellent series <em>Traffick</em> from the UK, gut the segment showing how poor farmers at the other end of the supply line view the war on drugs, and throw in some of the most blatantly racist imaging seen from Hollywood in decades.  And why not underage sex too!</p>

<p>Lincoln.  Abolishing federalism was the right thing to do (and we&#39;ll sick a Reaper drone on your ass if you think or say otherwise.)</p>

<p>I could go on and on.  It&#39;s a great big hate machine, and it&#39;s fueled by drug money.  See my post <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1mpghg/helen_thomas_power_over_the_white_house_power/ccbpb8d">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But even the history that survived is warped into some sort of thing thats acceptable. I mean look at the REAL story of Columbus/Cortez and the slaughter of the aztec/maya/iroquois/cherokee/sioux natives. This country was FOUNDED on this complete slaughter. And even dumb people know this, as well as informed and awake people. But does anyone say anything more than &#39;yeah we stole the land from the natives and gave them diseases and mislead them with bullshit treaties that we immediately ruined&#39;? No. Everyone knows this side of the modern world was BUILT on a foundation of MASSIVE GENOCIDE, but even the people that KNOW this don&#39;t really seem to think it matters much or is very important, because it was IN THE PAST.</p>

<p>If 200 years from now, all the history books of america were completely accurate (or as much as they could be) it wouldn&#39;t make a difference, because even the people opposed to their own society wouldn&#39;t really give a fuck.</p>

Its its dumb to think this land was virgin, our founders talk of virgin land but thats because of the 200 plus years since contact most of the natives died off leaving behind great works of civilization.

    <div class="md"><p>All movies are brainwashing. Some are just more focused and determined in their propaganda message than others, where the propaganda is somewhat incidental. But it is always there. Hollywood has a certain social narrative, and anything that lies outside that narrative is mocked or reviled in the movies. As for historical facts ... we don&#39;t know the historical facts about most of history. All we&#39;ve ever known is what the elite ruling class wants us to know, and puts in their books, and their media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what constitutes brainwashing exactly, but you can be sure that these movies will be the most vivid memory of a subject.  It takes awareness to mentally separate historical fact from movie specifics, and even to an aware mind, there can be some bleeding together of memories.  I try to avoid these types of exaggerations, just to be safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really obvious just how manufactured it is too. The lady or whatever is this pure, morally pristine female (that&#39;s important) who through endless analyzing of whatever the fuck found Bin Laden and avenged America.</p>

<p><em>But you can&#39;t know the real one. Too risky.</em> <em>Al Qaida</em> <strong>wants</strong> <em>her ass.</em></p>

<p>Yeah, because she doesn&#39;t fucking exist. She&#39;s a character slab for America to get all mushy over at how this woman neglected her body, mind, and soul in this holy quest to avenge us all against a guy a shit ton of people don&#39;t even think did it. When they trotted her out at the end to ID the body and that was that, no DNA, no teeth imprints, nothing, I was done. Well, the divine CIA analyst says that&#39;s who the pictures on her computer showed. Go ahead and flush him. Get fucked, movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Green Berets, Deerhunter and Apocalypse Now probably sum up the modern view of the Vietnam War for many... except in Vietnam where the truth was felt a bit more deeply...
I always wanted to see a Vietnam film from the other side that might right the balance. Guess they didn&#39;t have the millions to spend...being a nation of cottage industry and peasant farmers...</p>
