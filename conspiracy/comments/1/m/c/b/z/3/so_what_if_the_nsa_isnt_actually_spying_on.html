<p>We have a comprehensive surveillance system in place which covers multiple communications technologies and is almost certainly scooping up the data of FAR more innocent Americans than the number of terrorists who even exist.  What if that&#39;s actually the entire point of it?  </p>

<p>If there were some under-the-table deals between the security establishment and any of the major corporate powers it would be easy to see how easily and lucratively that flood of data could me monetized.  It would be a marketing dream come true.  They would have their finger on the pulse of America in more ways than we can even imagine.  </p>

<p>They would have the power to destroy their enemies, to blackmail practically anyone, to destroy their competitors and further entrench their monopoly status to invulnerable levels of market entrenchment and control.  They could play America like a goddamn piano, except a piano that would cough up billions upon billions of dollars per year in labor and economic activity.</p>

<p>They would completely fucking own us. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to add this...</p>

<p>The United States is the largest seller of weapons and actively sells/gives small arms to numerous known terror entities around the world as well as the Mexican mafia/drug cartels just across our borders.  Yet some in that very same government want to restrict or take away its citizens rights to own a firearm.  Talk about total and complete hypocrisy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Nye says a carbon tax would get all the little people PAID.  Like thousands of dollars, all for the purpose of having sufficient resources to deal with the effects of the ecological impact of the oil industry.  I don&#39;t give a fuck if you believe in global warming, how about all the inedible shrimp in the gulf?  Ecological carelessness due to a lack of accountability has a cost, if you think that&#39;s not so, explain how.</p>

<p>I guess there&#39;s a lot of military hardware and clever folks who are paid by the oil companies and their friends, so the little people won&#39;t ever be able to cause the oil people to pay for the costs they&#39;re incurring, so it&#39;s a moot point.</p>

<p>I thought I had read that one of the purposes of domestic surveillance is to keep tabs on any increase in awareness about this situation regarding environmental destruction, and the masses demanding some accountability for that lost value (fishing resources, water resources, many other kinds of resources destroyed by the unaccountable oil industry).</p>

<p>I might not live much longer, but if the idea that we&#39;re being fucked in this way becomes widespread, and the solution is clear, the whole system is threatened (and I suppose that would extend to national security, from some people&#39;s point of view).</p>

<p>Personally, I view the threats that exist to agriculture, and water and the necessities of life for everyone as a threat to national security, and by extension, whatever threatens all those things is a threat to national security.</p>

<p>Yes, in general, the goal is to prevent individuals from taking possession of physical natural resources, removing them from the so-called &quot;democratic&quot; &quot;capitalist&quot; system, because there aren&#39;t enough to go around.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a rush for the exits, they want to be able to shut it down.</p>

Lives will be given,  lives will be taken,  money will be spent,  fears and hopes will be instilled accordingly.   Army,  think tanks,  banks,  and board rooms, academia,  the media a colossal spy network on commerce,  individuals, governments,  and the police/prison system will be enlisted at full hilt to make this happen,  millions of Americans are in its full time service.   &quot;What is good for ____ is good for America.&quot;   On these points both parties agree.   On other points,  especially points that can divide and distract the population,  providing an entertaining circus,  politicians will argue and test and develop the upcoming next generation of leaders.   </p>

<p>But speeches will appeal to a story,  a myth,  a history of an exceptional,  brave,  noble,  generous,  peace loving and compassionate group of wise Americans who have,  are,  and always will be on the side of god in the forward march of &quot;democracy&quot;,  for the sake of freedom,  progress,  equality,  blah, blah, blah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best part of the data collecting is how it is essentially useless to the collectors of the data,  for confirmation see, 2012 election, following a full two year campaign to :::: you must hate your President messaging:::: and the careful manipulation of the Republican Primaries. </p>

<p>One could even consider the stealth release of the data by the tool Snowden to have a double edge.  It was quite deliberately meant to unseat the President, based on an idea that we would be shocked, surprise many of us knew of this already.  </p>

<p>The other edge, since they are making so many wrong conclusions from the data and their imagined success at manipulation of ideas, they are simply trying to scare us into shutting up, and dropping out of the dialog.  </p>

<p>I think they are believing their own internet shills and propaganda.<br/>
how are they going to differentiate, the real from the created dialogs? </p>

<p>We just need them to stop spending our tax money for it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stalin, on the other hand, argued in 1933 that the further the country would move forward in constructing socialism, the more acute forms of struggle will be used by the doomed remnants of exploiter classes in their last desperate efforts - and therefore, political repression was necessary to prevent them from succeeding in their presumed goal of destroying the Soviet Union. Stalin believed that the class enemy could even worm its way into the party claiming to lead a socialist state. </p>

<p>i think this should be the real headlines in the papers regarding the all encompassing NSA scandal.  Basically every day more evidence comes out showing these tools are not used for terrorists AT ALL.  even when it was stated that high ranking terrorists or anyone looking to damage America would not be using gmail, yahoo, etc. anyway.</p>

<p>even more than making money its about pure, total, absolute control.  and the average citizen was never even supposed to know.  this is like insider trading to the infinite degree but not limited to the financial markets.</p>

<p>if they can view, im sure its not too far off that they can add or install something to your email such as CHILD PORN.  and you are now destroyed forever with very little hope for proving your innocence.</p>

<p>Certainly not the state. </p>

This is a tin foil classic, there are so many holes in it if you think about it.</p>

<p>Does every single &quot;corporation&quot; get access to this data flow? What if there&#39;s a corporation that gets left out, don&#39;t you think they spill the beans on everyone else? What if I start a corporation, &quot;Itsalwayslulzy Inc&quot; ... if I have a couple million bucks, can I buy access into this data stream?

It&#39;s not like data brokerage firms aren&#39;t doing this already, the NSA simply goes a little bit further. I mean how do you think companies like Stratford work exactly? This is exactly what is already happening and has been for many years. Never forget that a large amount of the work the NSA has been doing is using private companies, companies that are allowed to use their information how they chose.</p>

<p>Any relevant data that matters to how customers operate is already available legally, without the NSA&#39;s help. And any data that is about opposition groups to whatever company is already collected by firms like Stratford and HBGary and others like them.</p>
