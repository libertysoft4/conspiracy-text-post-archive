        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so yesterday I was having a conversation with my wife and her dad, about Ison.  He is somewhat informed about things, but doesn&#39;t do anything to prepare in case of a long SHTF situation.  My wife is frustratingly happy go lucky, and simply says that I am being paranoid. Then they started talking about a zombie Apocalypse. Sarcasticly... I explained to them that my definition of a &quot;zombie&quot; is a hungry desperate person who will kill you for your food/stuff, to feed their family.  They just brushed it off. I hope nothing happens, but I will always be as prepped as possible in case of any situation.  How do you deal with people like this? </p>

<p>TL:DR family brushes off prepping as paranoid, How do you deal/explain with out sounding crazy? </p>

It&#39;s just frustrating, when I try to explain to my family that they too should have a plan just in case.  These are people who think the store will never run out of food, and water. Or they think that asteroids, meteors, floods, CME, will not disrupt our ability to go get what we need with ease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;my definition of a &quot;zombie&quot; is a hungry desperate person who will kill you for your food/stuff&quot; That is very interesting, because my husband and I call the creepy, drugged out homeless/weirdos that wander around town at night &quot;zombies&quot;! Sometimes we have to go out at odd hours and see these.. weird, aimless people walking around, shiftless types who look like they&#39;d stab you for a cigarette. I also noticed a LOT of creeps in those mobility scooters about. We had gone through a Del Taco drive thru around 12:45 am, we were just exiting through their circuitous exit driveway and some shirtless bum in a scooter was RIGHT THERE as we left, before we could pick up speed. He was WAITING for us to exit so he could beg for spare change or whatever. These guys (and some gals) have seriously started us fantasizing about creating a type of &quot;zombie eradicator&quot;: a &quot;zap gun&quot; of sorts- aim it at the actor and he/she mysteriously and instantly vaporizes. </p>

<p>On topic, I wonder if these zombie movies are in a way preparing us FOR a &quot;zombie invasion&quot;: all of these people on assistance, and the dregs of society suddenly finding themselves without state support- say, if the $$ money pot they live off of should dry up instantly- a REAL shit hits the fan possibility! Imagine <em>everyone</em> who lives off of welfare, SSI, SSDI, and food stamps finds their gravy train ran out of coal. The news comes on with a Special Report: USA is broke! Sorry, all your checks will bounce, each man for himself. Wow- my husband actually believes this is going to happen in real life, and SOON. He thinks all of these zombie invasion movies are actually a kind of secret hint as to what&#39;s to come. Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, don&#39;t assume it will just be bums that will be dangerous in the event of a massive emergency. <em>Everyone</em> will run out of food and water in a week or two without The National Guard bringing it in and it&#39;s possible in massive devastation that won&#39;t happen.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do stock food, <strong>never tell a soul unless they live in the house and they will not talk about it to anyone.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you broadcast the fact you have a large stock of food to the neighbours, you will be the source of the food whether you want to share it or not. And people will kill you for it if it means their family gets to eat when they are starving to death.</p>

But like I said, they are either people in my plans already, or people I would like to see survive. Everyone else will have to find their own way. </p>

<p>The only way to deal with people (my wife is same) is to not deal with it, pre-pair all you want but just keep it to yourself, to be honest this is the best advice because if something did happen in the future the less people that know about how &quot;prepared&quot; you are the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you tried showing them how a simple windy storm brought NY to it&#39;s knees?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Apparently people in the south are natural &quot;peppers&quot;.  Hurricane Hugo was just two weeks of camping and cutting firewood for our neighborhood.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>My Parent&#39;s stopped doing it for some reason; said &quot;it&#39;s weird now to do that.&quot; I followed up with, your parents did it, NY didn&#39;t and look at how that turned out.  We never had issues with food when we didn&#39;t have power for weeks growing up, and now it&#39;s <em>weird</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>That just got them thinking about it and how it became <em>weird</em> to &quot;prepare&quot;.  They have started to get back into the habit of it since then.</p>

It&#39;s funny, I try to be practical when I am explaining it, but some people are so media brainwashed that they think it&#39;s all a conspiracy and the government will protect us.

<p>That was enough to change her mind on just about everything.</p>

<p>When I was talking to my Parents about this, it was very creepy from both sides.  Once they started thinking about it they couldn&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t feel that way anymore.

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you should say that.  Every time I hear about a weather related disaster situation, I make sure to bring it up.
