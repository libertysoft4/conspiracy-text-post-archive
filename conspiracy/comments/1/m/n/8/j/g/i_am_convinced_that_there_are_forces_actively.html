    <div class="md"><p>If you seek education after high school then you can learn much about the financial world.  High school though is a different story.  I had ZERO financial education in high school, so I agree with you based on that experience, however in college and beyond, the level of knowledge you can obtain vastly depends on your drive to learn it.  No one can stop your thirst for knowledge after you are out of the public school system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My nephew is getting married very young, and expressed how affording a diamond ring will take time to get money for, without skipping a beat a cousin in her low 20s looked at him like he was ignorant and said &quot;just buy it with a credit card&quot;.  When most of the room nodded with agreement, I knew instantly that something is terribly wrong with finance education, and a scary amount of the population are point in fact, financially retarded.           </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to toot my own horn, but I&#39;m finding out I&#39;m a rare person for my age.  By that I mean, by the age of 30, i paid off my college debt, bought 2 cars with cash, and put 20% downpayment towards a 140,000 home, (even though the bank said I qualified for a 300,000 home).  All this on less than 50k salary with no financial assistance from parents at any point, even during college, one time my dad handed me $10 for some gas, that&#39;s it.  Have people forgot how to save money, and stop blowing it on stupid shit?  If it was up to me I would have kept saving and bought a house with cash, but I&#39;m having a son and the mortgage rates earlier this year were at a historic low so I went for it.  When I told the loan officer I plan to put down 20% for a conventional loan instead of an FHA loan, he asked me if I got it from a trust fund, he&#39;s so used to young people having no savings, that that was his first reaction.  Really fucking sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American spending/financial culture is really fucked up. Unfortunately a lot of people are...kind of stupid and either cannot or just do not figure things out for themselves. A single class in say, one&#39;s senior year of high school would help this <em>immensely</em> and probably be the most useful we ever took. But let&#39;s see, that would <em>significantly</em> cut into...sales tax, income tax, credit card company profits, all kinds of business where people are overspending, excessive home loan, et cetera. Financial education would destroy the rich. Or at east vastly level the paying field. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes me want to scream. It seems so basic and obvious, hence why I feel that some one or some thing is actively blocking it to protect their own interests. Financial education in all schools would be huge. At the moment the US population is dumbfounding financially ignorant. You really have to go out of your way to educate yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was contacted to go to the local high school and spend a day going over financial literacy with the seniors.  ( one hour per group).  I even went over the theory that high student Loan debt kept graduates from focusing on what I retested them because they needed a job to repay the debt.  I credited Chomsky of course.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a good program they do in my state it&#39;s mainly geared against credit card sent and credit rating protection.  Of course that&#39;s one hour a year for a student... Which is woefully inadequate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Financial Education would be death blow to a lot of industries across the spectrum.</p>

<p>Imagine if people worked out total cost of an item. They might even put off buying something for months at a time instead of grabbing the plastic and &quot;just going for it&quot;.</p>

<p>Imagine if people worked out how much something actually costs by simply multiplying that low monthly payment over what 60 months now? That 500 dollar TV now costs 3000.00 ?!?!?</p>

<p>Imagine the devastation if people worked out how much those credit card interest payments are literally draining them dry? Why the credit card companies might lose billions and billions of dollars!</p>

<p>Imagine how much less of a home people might buy if they knew the total cost? People might just wait for years to put a huge down payment down and look at short fixed rates, that would devastate the mortgage lenders!</p>

<p>What if they found out about depreciation on their brand new shiny vehicles versus just buying a used one? The auto companies would cry, they would weep over the loss in new car sales!</p>

<p>Imagine if students worked out just how long and how much they will owe for student loans? They might just get a trade and be able to get by just fine! </p>

<p>Imagine the billions, maybe trillions in lost revenue if people actually started to save up to buy things instead of putting them on the old plastic? </p>

<p>Imagine the devastation of the richest families in the world if people just stopped doing a lot of really silly financial moves over their lifetime? What would happen if people had savings and the right insurance and even, god forbid - real retirement funds! Devastating it would be, just devastating...</p>
