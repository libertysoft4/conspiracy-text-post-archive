I will post links and a video that &quot;confirms&quot; what I am talking about. If my links are not legitimate sources, I am sorry; do your own legitimate search and feel free to share what you have found on here. I am going to be posting simple articles I have found...</p>

<p>The first is a youtube video:</p>

<p>As I have mentioned I do not care about my sources being legitimate... If you want to contradict all this information please do. I am open to listen to all kinds of opinions.</p>

<p>Adding to all this info, I have my own source. A certain person who works with the Russian Government and Russian secret service, that person told me that something big is going to happen to the US and other countries will help. We all need to get ready for it.
I am still in touch with that person and will try to get more info soon.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and sharing what you have to share...</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to &quot;dromoe&quot; for sharing another link:</p>

<p>Coincidence? </p>

<p>Edit 2: Thanks to &quot;5moreminutez&quot; for sharing his finding, this article claim that everything I have mentioned is an hoax.</p>

<p>True or False?</p>

<p>I have found another article that is interesting:</p>

<p>U.S. Air Force to shut down &#39;Space Fence&#39; surveillance system by October 1st.
I know it could have to do something with the fiscal year but I do think that&#39;s a lot of coincidences.</p>

<p>Today there was one of them gone and I would wonder what warrents a jet taking off like that to come back this afternnon.</p>

<p>And in some smaller airports I have seen many black aircraft helies mainly no markings none just refueling and flying off they do have lights but the tail numbers are black as well so you can&#39;t see them.</p>

<p>If I see them I will get a pic I have a few of the cia planes but don&#39;t know if that interests anyone here</p>

<p>kinda sorta, but not really... I live in a military town (is: would be ghost town farmville if it wasn&#39;t for the base) and this time of year is filled with rampant spending, but not for stocking up, but if they don&#39;t spend the money they&#39;re given they loose that money in the following year&#39;s budget. I was told this by multiple people, at different contractor companies, all who work directly with distribution of monies :/</p>
