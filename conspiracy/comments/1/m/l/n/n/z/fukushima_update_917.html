        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For anyone that&#39;s curious as to what has been going on in Fukushima lately here&#39;s a short synopsis. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/9171455/One-dead-after-powerful-typhoon-hits-Japan">9/15 - Fukushima preps to see a tropical strom/typhoon. Releases &quot;untainted&quot; water.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power said it released what was believed to be untainted rainwater into the Pacific Ocean in order to avoid flooding near the tanks - a step that could violate safety rules, the Nuclear Regulation Authority said. TEPCO says the radioactivity in the released water was within allowed discharge limits, but duty regulators at the plant were checking.</p>

<p>Recent acknowledgement by officials that contaminated water is leaking from underground and storage tanks into the ocean have triggered concerns about the plant&#39;s safety.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/typhoon-forces-tepco-to-release-tainted-water-into-sea?utm_campaign=jt_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=jt_newsletter_2013-09-17_AM">9/16 - Just kidding the water was &quot;tainted&quot;, but <em>safely</em> tainted.</a> </p>

<p>The typhoon that hit central and northeast Japan on Monday forced the operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant to release rainwater with low levels of radiation into the ocean.</p>

<p>&quot;We decided to release the water into sea as we reached a conclusion that it can be regarded as rainfall after we monitored levels of radiation,” TEPCO spokesman Yo Koshimizu said.</p>

<p>According to the spokesman, one liter of the water contained up to 24 becquerels of strontium and other radioactive materials—below the 30 becquerel per liter safety limit imposed by Japanese authorities for a possible release to the environment.</p>

<p><a href="http://fukushima-diary.com/2013/09/jp-gov-there-is-no-technology-to-remove-tritium-from-contaminated-waterappeal-international-world-for-technology/">9/17 - TEPCO to World: &quot;Please Help!&quot;</a></p>

<p>On 9/12/2013, NRA (Nuclear Regulation Authority) reported there is no technology to remove Tritium from the significant volume of the contaminated water.</p>

<p>They held the working group meeting for the contaminated water in Fukushima nuclear plant on 9/12/2013. In this meeting, they stated Tepco is expecting the multiple nuclides removing system (ALPS) to purify the contaminated water clean enough to discharge.</p>

<p>However, even after the treatment by ALPS, radioactive water Tritium remains in the water. The density is approx. 100,000,000,000 Bq/m3. -gasp!</p>

<p>The working group concluded it is impossible to remove Tritium with the existing technology, they decided to appeal the world for the new technology.</p>

<p>Fun fact: The only thing that can SHIELD from tritium is SOLID GOLD. Tritiated water is actually 3 molecules of hydrogen vs 2 as in normal water, or H2O. This is why you can&#39;t &quot;filter&quot; tritiated or tritium-water).</p>

<p>There you have it. Updates on the most underreported and detrimental natural disaster to ever grace mankind. </p>

<p>H3O+ is the hydronium ion.  Tritiated water is just replacing one or both hydrogens of H2O with tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody knows. If we knew where the coriums (molten cores) were, may have a better guess. It&#39;s not really comparable to Chernobyl, because the stricken reactor there burned hotly for a short period of time. It had large sand/boron basins that mixed with the molten fuel and diluted it, and the Soviets dumped hundreds of tons of sand and lead on top of it (killed many heli pilots in the process). </p>

<p>Also, Chernobyl only had 1 reactor melt down, without any MOX fuel, in an area 40x less densely populated than Japan. Without those extremely problematic spent fuel pools sitting on the top of blown-out unit buildings.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s another major earthquake at Daiichi, could get rather nasty. Could they bury the whole site in concrete? Could anyone work there, or would everything have to be remotely controlled?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another update on &quot;highly radioactive&quot; water leaks at Fukushima - Atomic Insights  </p>

<p>The media frenzy about the detection of water leaks from the vast tank farm that Tokyo Electric Power Company has been forced to build to store water used to cool the three damaged cores at their Fukushima Daiichi power station continues to sizzle, even in the face of the potential for US attack on Syria. (A more rational solution to building an ever-increasing number of water tanks is to use a tanker to move the treated water a few miles out into the Pacific Ocean for safe disposal.)</p>

<p>The latest media discovery was that the reading that was initially reported as 100 mSv/hour was really 1,800 mSv/hour because the detector that produced the 100 mSv/hour reading had a range that maxed out at 100 mSv/hour. What few, if any, media reports include is an explanation that the measured dose rate is nearly 100% beta radiation and that it was measured at a distance of just 70 micrometers from the radioactive material. Beta radiation can be shielded by a single sheet of paper and will only travel about 1-2 meters in dry air.</p>

<p>Someone needs to help journalists understand that there is no way that a beta-emitting radiation source can cause a deadly dose to a human being unless it is ingested in a concentrated form. Even if it is in direct contact, about the worst it can do is cause a skin burn; I would also not recommend using water contaminated with a beta emitter for eye wash. I suppose I have volunteered for that educational task.</p>

<p>As some of the more informative initial reports stated, the gamma radiation from the leaked water measured 1.5 mSv/hour. That number is still valid; it was well within the accurate measuring range of the instrument used. In one of my previous updates on this topic, I postulated that the measurement was an outlier that might have used an unrepresentative sample of water.</p>

<p>According to an anonymous comment I received this morning that has the ring of truth from someone who knows what he is talking about, that postulate was wrong. Apparently, the concentrated waste water used for core cooling before going through the treatment facilitygenerally has a high beta dose rate when measured at a distance of a 70 micrometers.</p>

<p>After treatment, the concentration of beta emitters that are not tritium gets reduced by a factor of 4,000. (All Beta radiations entry in column 7 versus column 8 in &#39;&#39;Nuclide Analysis Results of Water at Water Treatment Facility&#39;&#39;.)</p>

<p>Since tritium is an integral part of water &#39;-- H2O where the H-3 is inseparable from the normal H-1 and H-2 &#39;-- it makes it through all water treatment. It is the isotope that causes any water used to cool a nuclear reactor to be called &#39;&#39;controlled pure water&#39;&#39; (CPW). The amount of tritium in this water is not a health concern, especially if diluted into the ocean.Here is the comment provided by the commenter who self identified as &#39;&#39;no name no country&#39;&#39;.</p>

<p>The numbers for &#39;&#39;leaked water&#39;&#39; in TEPCO&#39;s August 19, 2013 document are consistent with the numbers for the water stored in these tanks.</p>

<p>These tanks store waste water after the reverse osmosis treatment (desalination). The treated water goes back into the reactors for cooling, and the waste water is stored in these tanks. Since the water also goes through cesium absorption treatment (by SARRY) before it goes through reverse osmosis, it is low in cesium and other gamma nuclides.</p>

<p>The beta radiation from this water is about 2,000 mSv/hr at 70 micrometer dose equivalent.</p>

<p>The &#39;&#39;leaked water&#39;&#39; in August 19 document is this waste water itself. Measurements in August 23 documents are about water in the drains nearby, diluted with running water there.</p>

<p>For your info, the most recent nuclide analysis by TEPCO of water at various stages of treatment. The concentrated, post-RO waste water inside these tanks are No.8:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/f1/smp/2013/images/water_130809-e.pdf">http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/f1/smp/2013/images/water_130809-e.pdf</a></p>

<p>That this water is somehow leaking is a fact, but to say that this water is uncontrollably leaking into the Pacific Ocean is, as you say, worst fear-mongering. There is no evidence so far that this water is even reaching the ocean.</p>

<p>What is worse is this global frenzy on &#39;&#39;1,800 (or 2,200) mSv/hr radiation that kill people in 4 hours&#39;&#39; detected at Fukushima. It is not just people like Chris Busby but all mainstream media (including NYTimes, BBC, etc) and many alternative media who thrive on wrong information and fear repeat this completely erroneous information.</p>

<p>From the beginning, TEPCO has said this is dose equivalent at 70 micrometer to show the effect on skin and eye lens &#39;&#39; i.e. beta radiation, not gamma. It is completely consistent with the radiation measurement of this waste water, whose leaks happened before (no one paid any attention to those). But the media, through amazing ignorance after more than 2 years or willful ignorance to get eyeballs, has glossed over this important detail.</p>

<p>Japanese people who fear radiation are shell-shocked, and people outside Japan who do not have access to the primary information (in this case, information provided by TEPCO in Japanese) fear (some cheer) the end of the world or something catastrophic as such. I am thoroughly disgusted with this, and frankly I don&#39;t know what to do to educate people. I&#39;m at the point of giving up.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I responded to this comment. After putting in the effort to compose that response, I figured I would use it as part of today&#39;s post.</p>

<p>@No name no country</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give up. Get mad and engage your questioning attitude. Do you really believe that &#39;&#39;the media&#39;&#39; makes much money by inflating this particular story to attract eyeballs as opposed to any one of dozens of other ways to get the attention of viewers and readers. Heck, we are at the edge of a new war; surely people would tune in for more updates on that topic.</p>

<p>If the media does not have a very strong direct motive in terms of gaining viewer/reader attention for spreading this particular story, it is time to look for people, organizations and perhaps even countries with stronger motives.</p>

<p>As John Tucker pointed out in an earlier comment (<a href="http://atomicinsights.com/update-fukushima-water-leaks-unrepresentative-sample-used-support-fear-mongering/#comment-61989">http://atomicinsights.com/update-fukushima-water-leaks-unrepresentative-sample-used-support-fear-mongering/#comment-61989</a>) RT &#39;-- aka Russia Today &#39;-- has been particularly creative in making up additional fear mongering stories and inviting people like Chris Busby to spin tales that increase the shell-shocked attitude of the Japanese people. Russia has been hugely dependent on exporting oil and gas for a major portion of its national income for many years; it is making billions more every year that Japan keeps its functional nuclear plants shut down.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other actors with influence in the media that are engaged in the business of finding, extracting, processing, financing, and transporting oil and natural gas that are also benefiting hugely from the fear that people have about harmless &#39;&#39;leaks&#39;&#39; of &#39;&#39;radioactive&#39;&#39; water at Fukushima.</p>

<p>Aside: I used quotes around radioactive not because I believe it is NOT radioactive, but because fear stories never put the word into any context or tell anyone any useful information about how radioactive the water is. Without any quantification, it would not be a lie to say that ALL sea water is &#39;&#39;radioactive&#39;&#39;. End Aside.</p>

<p>Teaching the public to fear &#39;&#39;leaks&#39;&#39; of water containing minuscule quantities of radioactive material (measured in grams) also distracts them from the enormous DUMPS called smokestacks that push many billions of tons of combustion waste products &#39;-- some of which are carcinogenic or toxic in concentrated form &#39;-- into our shared atmosphere.</p>

<p>Some worry that we are doomed to fail when I point out that the real opposition to the vastly increased use of nuclear energy instead of fossil fuel wherever it makes sense is the global fossil fuel industry and its courtiers. It is an extremely wealthy, savvy and politically powerful foe. However, I like to remind people that there are far more energy consumers in the world than energy producers; many of them are also rich and powerful. Few fossil fuel consumers bear any love for Big Oil. Its booms and busts have had a large negative effect on their ability to prosper and live secure, comfortable lives.</p>

<p>I came of age during the 1970s. Because I like to use gasoline powered machines (cars, boats, planes, etc) Big Oil became one of my lifelong foes during the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo. I turned 14 during the period when my dad had to get up at &#39;&#39;oh dark thirty&#39;&#39; in order to get in line to fill up his gas tank so he could commute to his job 40 miles from our suburban home.</p>

<p>I hated the thought that I would get my driver&#39;s license at a time when everyone was worried that the price of oil and its availability would continue to be a major issue. It is hard to explain how depressing that thought was to a guy who had dearly loved the experience of being able to freely travel a great country like the United States in large, comfortable station wagons and campers.</p>

<p>As a career officer in the US Navy who attended the Navy War College&#39;s course of for national strategy and policy, I spent a lot of time learning the vital nature of reliable petroleum supplies and the way that single group of products has influenced our history as a nation &#39;-- including numerous wars and lesser conflicts, some of which resulted in millions of casualties.</p>

<p>When I announced to my colleagues that I was resigning my commission in the US Navy in 1993 to found Adams Atomic Engines, Inc. to design and build small, simple, economical nuclear-heated gas turbines, one colleague make a prescient comment. He said, &#39;&#39;Good luck Rod, but the oil companies will never let you succeed.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent the last 20 years figuring out how to make a liar out of him. It has been quite a struggle, but I think I am getting closer to a successful strategy.</p>

<p>I hope you agree that it is time to fight FUD with information and to fight concentrated power and wealth with the distributed power and wealth of information-enabled, free-thinking people who have nothing to fear.</p>

<p>On a separate topic, I am looking forward to the House Oversight Committee hearing that is scheduled for September 10. It will be interesting to find out how the NRC is going to respond to the mandamus ruling directing them to finish their evaluation of the DOE&#39;s Yucca Mountain licensing evaluation.  </p>

<p>Radiation Protection Basics</p>

<p>Understanding Radiation: </p>

<p>Radiation Protection BasicsThree basic concepts apply to all types of ionizing radiation. When we develop regulations or standards that limit how much radiation a person can receive in a particular situation, we consider how these concepts might affect a person&#39;s exposure.</p>

<p>Time The amount of radiation exposure increases and decreases with the time people spend near the source of radiation.</p>

<p>In general, we think of the exposure time as how long a person is near radioactive material. It&#39;s easy to understand how to minimize the time for external (direct) exposure. Gamma and x-rays are the primary concern for external exposure.</p>

<p>However, if radioactive material gets inside your body, you can&#39;t move away from it. You have to wait until it decays or until your body can eliminate it. When this happens, the biological half-life of the radionuclide controls the time of exposure. Biological half-life is the amount of time it takes the body to eliminate one half of the radionuclide initially present. Alpha and beta particles are the main concern for internal exposure.</p>

<p>How does EPA use the concept of time in radiation protection?When we set a radiation standard that assumes an exposure over a certain period, we are applying the concept of time. For example, we often express exposures in terms of a committed dose. A committed dose is one that accounts for continuing exposures over long periods of time (such as 30, 50, or 70 years). It refers to the exposure received from radioactive material that enters and remains in the body for many years.</p>

<p>When we assess the potential for exposure in a situation, we consider the amount of time a person is likely to spend in the area of contamination. For example, in assessing the potential exposure from radon in a home, we estimate how much time people are likely to spend in the basement.</p>

<p>Top of page</p>

<p>Distance The farther away people are from a radiation source, the less their exposure.</p>

<p>How close to a source of radiation can you be without getting a high exposure? It depends on the energy of the radiation and the size (or activity) of the source. Distance is a prime concern when dealing with gamma rays, because they can travel long distances. Alpha and beta particles don&#39;t have enough energy to travel very far.</p>

<p>As a rule, if you double the distance, you reduce the exposure by a factor of four. Halving the distance, increases the exposure by a factor of four.</p>

<p>Why does exposure change more rapidly than the distance?The area of the circle depends on the distance from the center to the edge of the circle (radius). It is proportional to the square of the radius. As a result, if the radius doubles, the area increases four times.</p>

<p>Think of the radiation source as a bare light bulb. The bulb gives off light equally in every direction, in a circle. The energy from the light is distributed evenly over the whole area of the circle. When the radius doubles, the radiation is spread out over four times as much area, so the dose is only one fourth as much. (In addition, as the distance from the source increases so does the likelihood that some gamma rays will lose their energy.</p>

<p>Exposure at 2 feet</p>

<p>Exposure at 4 feet</p>

<p>The exposure of an individual sitting 4 feet from a radiation source will be 1/4 the exposure of an individual sitting 2 feet from the same source</p>

<p>How does EPA use the concept of distance in radiation protection?We also consider distance in analyzing potential exposures from a source. If a person is at a contaminated site, or working around radioactive material, we assess how the exposures vary if the person is closer to, or farther away from, the source of radiation.</p>

<p>Top of page</p>

<p>ShieldingThe greater the shielding around a radiation source, the smaller the exposure.</p>

<p>Shielding simply means having something that will absorb radiation between you and the source of the radiation (but using another person to absorb the radiation doesn&#39;t count as shielding). The amount of shielding required to protect against different kinds of radiation depends on how much energy they have.</p>

<p>(Alpha)</p>

<p>A thin piece of light material, such as paper, or even the dead cells in the outer layer of human skin provides adequate shielding because alpha particles can&#39;t penetrate it. However, living tissue inside body, offers no protection against inhaled or ingested alpha emitters.(Beta)</p>

<p>Additional covering, for example heavy clothing, is necessary to protect against beta-emitters. Some beta particles can penetrate and burn the skin.(Gamma)</p>

<p>Thick, dense shielding, such as lead, is necessary to protect against gamma rays. The higher the energy of the gamma ray, the thicker the lead must be. X-rays pose a similar challenge, so x-ray technicians often give patients receiving medical or dental X-rays a lead apron to cover other parts of their body.How does EPA use the concept of shielding in radiation protection?We take into account the type of shielding that might be provided by soil when we assess sites that have been contaminated or used for disposal of radioactive material. We also account for the shielding provided by buildings for a person working or living at a site that has been cleaned up.</p>

So, similar to Uranium 232 (naturally occuring) vs Uranium 239 (7 additional neutrons per atom). Similarly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_hydrogen">hydrogen</a> has three natural isotopes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Protium - 1 proton</li>
<li>Deuterium - 1 proton + 1 neutron</li>
