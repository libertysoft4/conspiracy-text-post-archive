<p>And it&#39;s very strange, the top portion in the center of WTC 7 collapses in on itself first, the windows blow open down the building, it all looks like a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>That said, I still have never seen any credible explanation for how a government agency was able to keep such a huge operation a total secret? The Bush Administration had more holes than a sinking ship, how does something like 9/11 kept totally secret?  Even if it was a CIA group, do you know how many people would have needed to be involved with putting explosives in the WTC buildings before the planes flew into them?  Way too many to keep this a secret for 12 years.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a reasonable explanation as to how this has kept a secret for so long, when clearly hundreds of people were involved?</p>

I&#39;m not saying this could be done with half a handful of people, but I think it could be achieved with a lot less then hundreds of hundreds. If you are a shitty enough individual that you would knowingly go into an occupied building and plant explosives, you probably don&#39;t even know the meaning of guilt. Then if that same individual is offered a choice of a suitcase full of money to keep quiet or a bullet to the face if they say a word, would you still be surprised if whistle-blowers are few and far between?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol/ your argument is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Humans are capable of all manner of savagery. You think that the people who places explosives in an attempt to end lives would be overwrought with guilt upon success and reflection? </p>

<p>Criminals occasionally confess their crimes, but not with any overwhelming frequency. Denial isn&#39;t just a river in Egypt...</p>

<p>as regards to your assertion that it would have taken a suspiciously large organization to pull off- true dat. Except Bush was running security, 40% of the buildings was vacant. WTC7 was occupies by the Secret Service. There are accounts of the floors that that planes hit being filled with &quot;computer memory databanks&quot; that required reinforcement to the floors to support their weight in the months prior to the event. </p>

<p>Get the demo crews to do their job then offer them and all non-essential personnel an all expenses paid trip to their dream vacation. Coincidentally, they are all on flights AA 11 &amp; AA 77 and UA 175 &amp; UA 93. No hush hush money to be paid and you get your &quot;innocent&quot; lives to sacrifice. Those not on the flights get reminded of what will happen if they speak out simply by someone mentioning 9/11. </p>

<p>Not &quot;clearly&quot; at all. In fact it&#39;s been estimated by some, with explanations, that it could have been done by as few as 3-4 dozen, including the top-down hierarchy. And if those few dozen happened to all be Mossad agents then they would have no reason to blab considering Israel&#39;s constant desire to get the US to send Americans to fight and die in wars against the countries Israel deems &quot;enemies&quot;.

<p>The penthouse collapses first because the core structural support for the building had collapsed and buckled a few seconds earlier. At the time the whole building came down, you&#39;re just seeing the facade and external supports collapsing. That&#39;s part of the reason why freefall was achieved for 2.25 seconds; it was pretty much only the facade and external support falling, not the core supports and floors. It&#39;s also why the building was sagging and twisting beforehand.</p>

<p>You know that makes absolutely no difference right? There have been MANY steel framed buildings that burned out of control for MUCH MUCH longer than WTC 7 and their structure was never compromised at all.

<p>Only one of those scenarios is proven.</p>

<p>Proven? Where? The NIST report? They won&#39;t release their CAD model to be independently verified. They also changed their entire model when it was definitively proved that the building fell at free fall speeds.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a whole channel of interviews with structural engineers that will explain it for you: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL50E893DDF7DADE8F">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL50E893DDF7DADE8F</a> </p>

<p>You can see the smoke rising of the explosion.</p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s smoke from the fires (which are proven to have occurred), not smoke from a demolition explosion (which is not proven to have occurred). This isn&#39;t difficult.</p>

<p>Yes. There are hundreds of eyewitnesses that reported the secondary explosions moments after they happened: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNLa93Q_rvM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNLa93Q_rvM</a></p>

<p>There is an entire group of structural engineers that say the only way it could have fallen the way it did was a controlled demolition and they present PHYSICAL PROOF that explosives were found at the site : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-V1CiuGMJo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-V1CiuGMJo</a></p>

<p>What fires? There are small office fires on two floors then it goes down. Video showing that here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atbrn4k55lA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atbrn4k55lA</a></p>
