    <div class="md"><p>im aware of how the system works,</p>

<p>unlike a credit card however, if you are 10k in debt to the bank, you cant show up with a 100 dollar payment and ask for another 10k loan. Unfortunately for us, the government can. </p>

<p>The rules of money than ou and I follow and have learned about dont apply to the US federal government. In debt? need more money? heres another loan! With the federal reserve they literally have a bottomless pit of cash</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not bottomless, every time they mint another dollar the value of the dollar decreases. The more money you have in circulation the less your money is actually worth. It&#39;s a common misconception that the federal reserve can just print money without any fallout.</p>

<p>So they actually need your tax money and economic cash flow. Because if they continue to print money to pay back their debt the value of the dollar will crash. So the government takes all these loans and then demands the public pay for it with increased taxes or entirely new ones. Also the federal reserve does not give the government free money. They force the country to pay interest on whatever loan is taken. It isn&#39;t a government piggy bank, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im well aware of the banking situation, but thank you for explaining it for others who may not know and stumble on it.</p>

<p>the pit of cash is indeed bottomless, but the process is not sustainable; dont accidentally get these two mixed up, the devil is in the details. Meaning they can take up any sum of money they deem fit at any moment, but it cant be done forever. They dont even &quot;print&quot; the money, its all 0s in a ledger somewhere.</p>

<p>the value of the dollar will never hit 0, as thats quiet impossible, but it will get pretty damn close which is enough to rattle and destroy any economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wondered this myself. If it could be proven beyond reasonable doubt that our government had engineered 9/11, what would we do? Because at this point the government has put themselves in a situation where they are armed to the teeth to fight civil unrest. They rig most systems and own the media. There would be no peaceful way to do anything, and because of that I feel like most people would in fact choose to do nothing. But if foreign governments and the UN became aware, I would imagine that the US would be hit with so many lawsuits and demands for people within our government to be held accountable that it would shake to the very core. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is what I do - i don&#39;t really care.  my carecup is empty as far as government/religion/etc is concerned.  i abide by my own ethics and morals.</p>

<p>once everyone just quits caring and lives by universal laws, then the governments will lose their power.</p>

<p>government is kind of like a dollar.  the dollar is worth something because people believe that the piece of paper has value, when in reality its just a piece of paper with some scribbles on it.  same thing with government.  they only have power because people believe that the government has power over their lives.  the true awakening is seeing that &quot;government officials&quot; are no better and no different than the common man, except they are power hungry and greedy and want to control things that shouldn&#39;t be in their control.  once this is realized and people just start &quot;living&quot; for each other, human kind can advance.</p>

<p>that, and most people can&#39;t handle the truth...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A single person, I&#39;d say they are not different than any other single person. But a group of people with the means and desire to rule over other people? That becomes a different entity entirely. Just like they say that the people really hold the power. A single person holds no more power than any other person, but when we come together we are a force. That&#39;s what the government is, a force of like minded people who use their power to direct a nation. Now, not caring, that&#39;s actually the opposite of what you believe needs to happen. Because not caring makes you a singular person in your singular world. The realization you speak of comes from people coming together for a cause and fighting for all people. Fighting for the life and love and kindness everyone desires. Only then would human kind advance, as a unit and an entity of peace. But if we remain separate, if we chose to ignore and not care about the people around us and the entities that threaten any life... well that&#39;s where we are. Because we&#39;re comfortable in America. We get to chose to be singular people in our singular worlds. We turn a blind eye to the poor and a blind eye to the countries that are maimed by wars we fail to stop. Caring is the only way that we keep eachother safe from people who would otherwise come together and create power and dominance over other people. Now, if everyone in an exact moment just decided to live by universal law? That&#39;s an entity, that&#39;s a unit, because we&#39;re all doing it together. But when a government or a group decides to fight that principle? It threatens the lives of all those who don&#39;t care enough to do something about it.</p>

<p>Every nation on earth has an official secrets act, for a reason. </p>

<p>Also most nations also have a freedom of information act, for a reason.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But without knowing that reason, how can you say it&#39;s justice?</p>

<p>I mean, when you have things locked up and hidden, it leaves room for people to twist the system to protect their own interests and agendas. It allows governments to do terrible crimes without accountability. I understand why it is the way it is, but I also think that since we can&#39;t see most of what is hidden that the ability for corruption to grow wildly out of control becomes a very easy reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A single person, I&#39;d say they are not different than any other single person. But a group of people with the means and desire to rule over other people? That becomes a different entity entirely. Just like they say that the people really hold the power. A single person holds no more power than any other person, but when we come together we are a force. That&#39;s what the government is, a force of like minded people who use their power to direct a nation. Now, not caring, that&#39;s actually the opposite of what you believe needs to happen. Because not caring makes you a singular person in your singular world. The realization you speak of comes from people coming together for a cause and fighting for all people. Fighting for the life and love and kindness everyone desires. Only then would human kind advance, as a unit and an entity of peace. But if we remain separate, if we chose to ignore and not care about the people around us and the entities that threaten any life... well that&#39;s where we are. Because we&#39;re comfortable in America. We get to chose to be singular people in our singular worlds. We turn a blind eye to the poor and a blind eye to the countries that are maimed by wars we fail to stop. Caring is the only way that we keep eachother safe from people who would otherwise come together and create power and dominance over other people. Now, if everyone in an exact moment just decided to live by universal law? That&#39;s an entity, that&#39;s a unit, because we&#39;re all doing it together. But when a government or a group decides to fight that principle? It threatens the lives of all those who don&#39;t care enough to do something about it.</p>
