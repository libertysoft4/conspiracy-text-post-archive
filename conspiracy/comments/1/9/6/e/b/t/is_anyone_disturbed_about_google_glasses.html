    <div class="md"><p>I am disturbed by Google Glass for sure. Even without facial recognition the idea that it would be socially acceptable to wear a video camera that can record individuals stealthily is enough to be concerned.</p>

<p>The same can be said for smart phones and Facebook. A smart phone can be compromised in a way that it can be activated to record audio, listen in real time and/or track an individual with GPS. I don&#39;t think anyone who carries a smart phone or posts their information on Facebook (even with small circles of close friends and even with privacy) is at more of a risk than they already are. The only major difference with Google Glass is the ease of recording steathily in public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39; t use Facebook, I got ducktap on every fuckin camera hole on every device I own, the apps on my phone are limited and I don &#39;t use it for any other Internet purposes other than reddit sometimes. When I take pictures I have professional camera, I do everything on the internet on my pc computer with security and anonymity in mind. i try to avoid google at all costs.All those fuckin advances in technology are designed  for the  idiots such as banking from their apps and and wearing  google glasses to destroy any personal privacy they have left.  In a way I cringe because there are those who will do this to themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I implanted an RFID in my penis so that my GF knows where it is at all times. Seriously get over RFID people the range is stupidly small. RFID is used for marketing not government tracking. The government has much better ways to watch you. Anyone crying over RFID has absolutely no clue what tech is out there. </p>

<p>Now if they force you to put it in a drivers license and start putting up receivers at every intersection, then Id worry. Its not gonna happen it would cost far too much. Facial recognition technology is so much cheaper. Or what about body heat recognition tech? </p>

<p>Like I said you should update your opinion on RFID because its old and its not what they are using.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a camera on your head which is ran by google.  Google&#39;s CEO Erick Schmidt has no regard for privacy, &quot;If you have something that you don&#39;t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be doing it in the first place.&quot;  Let alone he went to the 2011 Bilderberg meeting and was rubbing elbows with the director of the NSA &amp;  the head of United States Cyber Command:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enjoy a free internet while you can</p>

<p>Speaking of personality disorders – when Peter Mandelson, who pushed through the digital economy bill, sits down with Keith Alexander – the director of the NSA and head of United States Cyber Command to discuss &quot;Social Networks: Connectivity and Security Issues&quot; you can be pretty sure they aren&#39;t hammering out how best to preserve the freedom of the internet.</p>

<p>Add a liberal sprinkling of cyber power in the form of Mark Hughes (Facebook), Eric Schmidt (Google) and Craig Mundie (Microsoft) and you have the perfect formula for a lock-down. Let&#39;s hope Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for digital agenda, got to push her &quot;No Disconnect Strategy&quot;. I&#39;d pay good money to have heard the head of the NSA&#39;s views on that one.</p>

<p>The camera isn&#39;t on 24/7.  Again, it&#39;s no different than any other camera except that it&#39;s worn on your face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In no time there will be ads and all kinds of shit. </p>

<p>What does this have to do with privacy?  People will reject it if there are too many ads.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, nothing to do with privacy.  If the terms of ownership are unacceptable, consumers will not buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the Google Glasses, for me, is that they&#39;re run through and by Google. If a person could have a similar device that wasn&#39;t attached to the services of a corporation that already controls to much information about everything, it would be much more appealing. It feels like putting on Google Glasses is the last step to bowing down before our Google masters, or something like that. Only then will Google see everyday life through everybody&#39;s own eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my 2 cents</p>

<p>Privacy is going away for us ordinary folks no doubt. The way technology is headed the internet is going to eventually be telepathic (i know i sound crazy). when people are telepathic there will be no secrets. Privacy is on its way out and TPTB are clawing to keep this feudal power structure the same but we will eventually win because knowledge is power. I&#39;m not too worried about this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me say something else. These will not be allowed in Texas. In Texas we have an improper photography law. If you take a picture or video of someones ass you are arrested. So if you look at someones ass with these you are technically committing a felony in Texas so I seriously doubt they will be permitted in my state. Just another thing I wanted to add.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sg-llp.com/sexoffense-types-improperphotography.php">http://www.sg-llp.com/sexoffense-types-improperphotography.php</a></p>

<p>It is considered a sexual offense. When this law was first passed a man was walking through a fair taking pictures of people. Some butt shots I guess. Everyone could see his camera. He was arrested and charged with the felony. So yeah you do have some expectations of privacy in public in Texas. </p>

<p>According to the Texas Penal Code 21.15 a person commits an offense if they person photographs or by videotape or other electronic means visually records another, without the other person&#39;s consent and with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.</p>

<p><a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/post/15404285">http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/post/15404285</a></p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re committing an offense if, a) you&#39;re taking a picture of a person who hasn&#39;t given you consent to do so, and b) that picture is for the sexual gratification of any person,&quot; Douglas said.</p>

<p>Bring it Google, there will be a lot of felonies passed out in Texas and then it will be outlawed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were better things coming down the pipeline then Google glass. You are spot on buddy. Facial recognition is on its way through this product. Personal privacy doesn&#39;t bother me because you choose to use the product but the invasion of others privacy is what bothers me. First time some ass comes to my front door with a pair of those on I&#39;m knocking him in the face. </p>

<p>Cyber hate crime? So be it. Google is just a off shoot of the CIA we all know what the tech Google comes out with is used for. Anytime the CIA needs something like a service, a CIA agent will quit and open that company and the CIA then pays them to do the job. Ala Google. Huge loophole. The CIA does this because they aren&#39;t allowed to operate on American soil. However they can pay a corporation to do something.</p>

<p>The CIA doesn&#39;t really scare me I am glad they work for us. What scares me is it always starts with the CIA then the tech is passed down to the FBI etc... You should see what they do with social networking good god. You&#39;d be horrified. So yeah I don&#39;t use stupidbook because I don&#39;t wanna be tagged and tracked. I wont be using Google glass because of the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The GPS thing I learned first hand. Worked in the industry back when they were first being implemented and lots of handsets didn&#39;t have options to turn them off or had a gui toggle (that did nothing in actuality) to ease consumer concerns about the tech. Also, you can google any number of stories where police were able to track someone with the GPS in their phone. Doesn&#39;t even have to be the GPS, really. Your phone has to communicate with a cell tower to get data. That information can be used to locate you down to a city block or two. And from there, it&#39;s elementary. </p>

Also, I have heard of cameras being found inside cable boxes (supposedly there&#39;s a Youtube video of a guy opening his box up to show where they are), and that not just webcams, but entire computer monitors are also camera lenses. Sorry I don&#39;t have any source for this, just some interesting stuff I&#39;ve heard. </p>

<p>Actually, it came from Kerry Cassidy&#39;s interview with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQM6x-t8sw">Jim Stone</a>. And yes, I hate it too that I just posted a link to a Kerry Cassidy interview. I can not STAND her. But the info is interesting.</p>

<p>Go to 1:47 and watch that video. Look at the left hand side of the top penthouse, you&#39;ll see it collapses seconds before the rest of the building goes. So while that penthouse is collapsing for those few seconds, all the internal structure of the building is giving way, then eventually the rest of the building follows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For that to be true, you&#39;d need the &#39;internal structure&#39; of the building to be completely fallen away to allow the free fall acceleration.   </p>

<p>You claim this happens when the penthouse goes down... so tell me, without an internal structure, why does the entire facade come down as one piece?   Did all the attachments of beams fail at once and become isolated from the standing facace (with no support?)   Even NIST&#39;s model can&#39;t reproduce this.  Have you seen their animation of it?   The facade crumples with the loss of support, and the model stops before the measured free fall acceleration.  </p>

<p>I think you are handwaving.</p>
