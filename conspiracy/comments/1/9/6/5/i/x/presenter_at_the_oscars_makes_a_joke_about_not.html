        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Even if it&#39;s not an actual conspiracy, it seems a bit... strange. </p>

<p>Mark Whalburg and some CG bear apparently named Ted presented a couple awards. Before the last one (I didn&#39;t catch what award it was), Ted makes a joke that Whalburg sounds like a Jewish name. Mark then corrects him, saying that he&#39;s Catholic. Ted then nervously tells him that he should say that he&#39;s Jewish in order to gain favor with the Jews and get more money. </p>

<p>Mark then opens the envelope and it turns out there&#39;s a tie. I don&#39;t often watch the Oscars (read: I never do and my mom just happened to be watching it while I was in the room), but I don&#39;t think ties are very common. The first winner is Zero Dark Thirty (aka a big fat propaganda film) and the second winner was Skyfall. </p>

<p>I just think it&#39;s weird how we basically get a &quot;submit to the Jews&quot; message and then a propaganda film ties for an award.</p>

<p>It was a joke...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on reality.  Most good jokes are that way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-stein19-2008dec19,0,4676183.column">http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-stein19-2008dec19,0,4676183.column</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never been so upset by a poll in my life. Only 22% of Americans now believe &quot;the movie and television industries are pretty much run by Jews,&quot; down from nearly 50% in 1964. The Anti-Defamation League, which released the poll results last month, sees in these numbers a victory against stereotyping. Actually, it just shows how dumb America has gotten. Jews totally run Hollywood.</p>

<p>How deeply Jewish is Hollywood? When the studio chiefs took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times a few weeks ago to demand that the Screen Actors Guild settle its contract, the open letter was signed by: News Corp. President Peter Chernin (Jewish), Paramount Pictures Chairman Brad Grey (Jewish), Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger (Jewish), Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton (surprise, Dutch Jew), Warner Bros. Chairman Barry Meyer (Jewish), CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves (so Jewish his great uncle was the first prime minister of Israel), MGM Chairman Harry Sloan (Jewish) and NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker (mega-Jewish). If either of the Weinstein brothers had signed, this group would have not only the power to shut down all film production but to form a minyan with enough Fiji water on hand to fill a mikvah.</p>

<p>The person they were yelling at in that ad was SAG President Alan Rosenberg (take a guess). The scathing rebuttal to the ad was written by entertainment super-agent Ari Emanuel (Jew with Israeli parents) on the Huffington Post, which is owned by Arianna Huffington (not Jewish and has never worked in Hollywood.)</p>

<p><strong>The Jews are so dominant, I had to scour the trades to come up with six Gentiles in high positions at entertainment companies. When I called them to talk about their incredible advancement, five of them refused to talk to me, apparently out of fear of insulting Jews. The sixth, AMC President Charlie Collier, turned out to be Jewish.</strong></p>

<p>Travolta made some allegations about being raped by, quote, &quot;homosexual jews&quot;.  All he tried to do was to &quot;get some&quot; from his (male) masseuse.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defendant began screaming at Plaintiff, telling Plaintiff how selfish he was; that Defendant got to where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his Welcome Back, Kotter days; and that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity. Defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth about our &quot;entertainment&quot; (really, dumbing down and propaganda) industry is pretty disturbing.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/jews-do-control-the-media/">http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/jews-do-control-the-media/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re a driven group, and not just in regards to the art world. We have, for example, AIPAC, which  was essentially constructed just to drive agenda in Washington DC. And it succeeds admirably. And we brag about it. Again, it’s just what we do.</p>

<p>But the funny part is when any anti-Semite or anti-Israel person starts to spout stuff like, “The Jews control the media!” and “The Jews control Washington!”</p>

<p>Suddenly we’re up in arms. We create huge campaigns to take these people down. We do what we can to put them out of work. We publish articles. We’ve created entire organizations that exist just to tell everyone that the Jews don’t control nothin’. No, we don’t control the media, we don’t have any more sway in DC than anyone else. No, no, no, we swear: We’re just like everybody else!</p>

<p>Does anyone else (who’s not a bigot) see the irony of this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drat, I am a bigot, so I don&#39;t count and my opinion is worthless.</p>

<p>Double drat et sacre bleu!</p>

<p>then 2 CIA movies take over the awards.. Argo (about CIA) and that bin laden fairy tale.  Oh don&#39;t forget the Nazi in uniform to give the old jews heart attacks..   Then you get Tarantino.. he&#39;s got a movie about Wagner..  ?Hitler&#39;s fave.     </p>

<p>What a load of crap.   You missed your flight on Sept. 11 Seth?  Then your cancelled show becomes 3 prime time shows on focks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are talking to a sock puppet.  He has 4 posts and one of them was anti-Semitic itself.</p>

<p>Basically what just happened is someone from <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a>  posted as <a href="/u/killthemnowbrothers">/u/killthemnowbrothers</a> then responded to himself as <a href="/u/speakerofthetruth">/u/speakerofthetruth</a>.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/196i85/seth_macfarlane_joke_zero_dark_thirty_win/">Someone posts it</a> to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and then cries themselves to sleep.</p>

<p>It happens a great deal more than you would think.  Besides account ages, it is most obvious when they refer to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a whole unit, rather than a group of differing individuals.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rather undecided as to what side of the fence OP is on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some conspiracy speculation:  </p>

<p>Seth Mcfarlane, creator of Ted, survived 9/11 because he missed his flight.  Supposedly his secretary made a mistake in telling him the flight time for the plane out of LA that hit the WTC.  The main characters on Family Guy (Chris, Meg, Lois) are all voiced by Jewish actors except the ones voiced by him.  </p>

<p>We can speculate that he was too important to sacrifice as the studios and actors would not have made hundreds of millions if not billions off his creations.  </p>

<p>Mark Whalberg and Seth Mcfarlane are Sabbath Goys and you pretty much have to be to have a career in Hollywood.  </p>
