<p>Yeah.  That&#39;s what makes it even scarier and more frustrating.  If people WERE more critical and aware of what&#39;s happening, then tactics like what happened at the awards wouldn&#39;t happen at all because those in charge would know that they wouldn&#39;t work.  But they know they WILL fly at this point because, like you said, there are indeed many who look on wide-eyed and buy the whole circus hook, line, and sinker.</p>

<p>Sad is right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her final points are worth noting here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this race, which was even more orchestrated, from my perspective than the run-of-the-mill rigged Presidential race here in America... In this race, they had 3 horses:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ZERO DARK THIRTY</p></li>
<li><p>ARGO</p></li>
<li><p>LINCOLN</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, all three were damaged goods.  All three are slanted views of history and all three contain outright lies.. that will go or have gone down in history as &quot;truth&quot;.  This is how the game is played.  It is all about swaying the hearts and minds of the masses.  And what better propaganda machine than the good old Oscar race...  The television audience is huge normally and worldwide.  If a government, such as the U.S. wants to make a political statement to the world.. what better way.  And to make sure the point was made... they trot out the President&#39;s wife.  And get her to do the honors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While being aware of the minutia pointing to a particular perspective isn&#39;t a bad thing, one need not be aware of the specific lies in order to still be very aware and cognisant still of the overall pro-government stance many of these films are drenched with.  One need not be aware of the specifics in order to still grasp the extent to which certain less-than-stellar yet very pertinent, overarching themes of controversy are NOT addressed in the films and are simply white washed and passed through.</p>

<p>I only saw Lincoln (for free), but, additionally, all three films romanticize their subject matter and the main characters being portrayed in a manner that is intended to cause the viewer to support and emotionally side with that character&#39;s perspective above anyone elses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thread is about propaganda in mass media entertainment. It&#39;s foolish to think that Operation Mockingbird was the first propaganda action in mass media entertainment in the US (after all, movies always had news reels play before them). However, it does illustrate that at the inception of television (the most consumed medium of mass entertainment) there was never a time when the it wasn&#39;t subject to propaganda influence; therefore, &quot;were there ever any boundaries in the first place?&quot;  </p>

<p>The problem you and I are having is in what area is on either side of the &quot;boundary&quot;. We don&#39;t see those areas the same. The areas I see are mass media (specifically television) and the sources of propaganda. I&#39;m not sure what yours are. Care to indulge?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeh.  Because if the first lady presented the award for best picture, it&#39;s obviously a very important film.  So people who haven&#39;t seen it, go to see it.  They leave the film feeling patriotic and also semi to very fearful of what Iran can do.  Suddenly you can use the feelings created by this movie as a backing for an invasion of Iran.  And before someone tells me we&#39;ll never invade Iran-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have YOU seen Argo? Are you sure?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps my disgust wouldn’t be as intense if it weren’t for the potentially great film suggested by Argo’s opening sequence: a history of pre-revolutionary Iran told through eye-catching storyboards. The sequence gives a compelling (if sensationalized) account of how the CIA’s meddling with Iran&#39;s government over three decades led to a corrupt and oppressive regime, eventually inciting the 1979 revolution. The sequence even humanizes the Iranian people as victims of these abuses. This opening may very well be the reason why critics have given the film credit for being insightful and progressive—because nothing that follows comes close, and the rest of the movie actually undoes what this opening achieves.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping its eye on the big picture of revolutionary Iran, the film settles into a retrograde “white Americans in peril” storyline. It recasts those oppressed Iranians as a raging, zombie-like horde, the same dark-faced demons from countless other movies— still a surefire dramatic device for instilling fear in an American audience. After the opening makes a big fuss about how Iranians were victimized for decades, the film marginalizes them from their own story, shunting them into the role of villains. Yet this irony is overshadowed by a larger one: The heroes of the film, the CIA, helped create this mess in the first place. And their triumph is executed through one more ruse at the expense of the ever-dupable Iranians to cap off three decades of deception and manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not full-fledged propaganda. The best way to appeal to someone is through their bias. Then, once the audience has accepted the source as credible, it opens them up to other ideas that they may have otherwise questioned. </p>

<p>Ultimately, you&#39;ve pointed out one line of dialogue in a film that spends two hours depicting Iranians as a highly suspicious, hostile threat to Americans and their international allies, yet you&#39;re suggesting that it somehow balances out. I&#39;m pretty sure those scales are heavily stacked, just not in your favor.    </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Perhaps my disgust wouldn’t be as intense if it weren’t for the potentially great film suggested by Argo’s opening sequence: a history of pre-revolutionary Iran told through eye-catching storyboards. The sequence gives a compelling (if sensationalized) account of how the CIA’s meddling with Iran&#39;s government over three decades led to a corrupt and oppressive regime, eventually inciting the 1979 revolution. The sequence even humanizes the Iranian people as victims of these abuses. This opening may very well be the reason why critics have given the film credit for being insightful and progressive—because nothing that follows comes close, and the rest of the movie actually undoes what this opening achieves.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping its eye on the big picture of revolutionary Iran, the film settles into a retrograde “white Americans in peril” storyline. It recasts those oppressed Iranians as a raging, zombie-like horde, the same dark-faced demons from countless other movies— still a surefire dramatic device for instilling fear in an American audience. After the opening makes a big fuss about how Iranians were victimized for decades, the film marginalizes them from their own story, shunting them into the role of villains. Yet this irony is overshadowed by a larger one: The heroes of the film, the CIA, helped create this mess in the first place. And their triumph is executed through one more ruse at the expense of the ever-dupable Iranians to cap off three decades of deception and manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>again am just trying to figure out what yr angle is...and really you thought that was the most insulting one? </p>

<p>not because I said that you dont think that the Laura Bush&#39;s participation is different than Michelle&#39;s because Laura is white...I would I found that the most offensive...and how is calling someone Anti-Obama an insult? I am anti-Harper and he&#39;s my PM. I am anti-Monarchy and those bastards still own Canada. </p>

<p>Anyways since I don&#39;t know you I wouldn&#39;t know what you find offensive. </p>

<p>Oh, you&#39;re being sarcastic. Shitty tactic, but w/e.</p>

<p>I disagree with you, but you are allowed to have your opinion too! I am not going to try to get you to change it. I just feel her time would be better spent elsewhere. You do not have to agree, but I am done with this. Have a nice evening! :)</p>
