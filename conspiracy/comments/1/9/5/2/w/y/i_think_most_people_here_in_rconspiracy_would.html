        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What I will explain to you will not be the best explanation for anarcho-capitalism. I would recommend that you look it up or watch Adam vs the Man for a thorough explanation.</p>

<p>Anarcho-capitalists believe that no man should be able to impose their will with the use of force over one another. They believe that government is the quasi-social, or socially accepted, monopoly of the use of force, which it is. If somebody breaks the laws the government makes, even if they are acting peacefully, they may be put in a cage and separated from society because they are deemed unworthy of society. Obviously i&#39;m talking about jail.</p>

<p>Government&#39;s foundation is the use of force through taxation. You are forced to pay taxes. If you don&#39;t pay taxes you are put in a cage deemed unworthy for society, despite you acting peacefully. Why can&#39;t people donate their money and establish voluntary efforts where tax dollars would normally go? This would kinda be like peaceful charity to those who need it (ex: hurricane victims, the poor, the homeless). When you use government, there&#39;s force and coercion involved, which an-caps find fundamentally wrong. When one says we need government, they&#39;re saying that we cannot peacefully, voluntarily accomplish something ourselves, and that we need an institution of force and violence to accomplish that for us.</p>

<p>An-caps also believe in a complete free market where anybody should be able to trade anything as long as they are acting peacefully. We do not have a true free market in our current system of government regulations, trade restrictions, and the unfair allocation of money to big corporations.</p>

<p>Since most people in r/conspiracy understand the bullshit that government is, I think they would accept an-cap beliefs and ideals more easily than most. Obviously there&#39;s a lot more to anarcho-capitalism than this, and I&#39;d urge you to look it up yourself. Like I said before, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AdamKokesh">Adam vs The Man</a> is a good YouTube channel that thoroughly explains and argues for anarcho-capitalism. An-cap philosophy truly is beautiful, and an-caps are some of the most peaceful people I know, so go check it out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s logic. If govt were only 5% of GDP and had that level of power (as they were in early 1900s), the benefit of taking over that power would be negligible, while today, with govt costing 40% of GDP, and taking $millions from some citizens through taxation, it incentivizes those citizens to take over the govt and get their money&#39;s worth. Every tax increase gives the ultra wealthy just that much more incentive to get into politics. Humans are not sheep, we are reactive, thinking creatures. Let me guess, you think minimum wage laws help the poor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ancap is not seeking to abolish government as defined by you (it seems eerily similar to the definition of society).
Ancap is about abolishing governments monopoly on provision and enforcement of law. Monopoly is source of corruption. Monopoly is source of asymetry of rights between people outside and people inside of government. Warlords simply leverage this asymmetry in their favor. Why? Because its there and its tempting, because it allows to get monopoly at cheap price of couple of politicians, it&#39;s simply not economically viable to get it another way. The only way to get rid of corruption is to abolish the monopoly and decetralize the power so instead of corrupt politicians you get all the power over your own life and you get to choose what to do with it.</p>

<p>Companies under free market are a lot more accountable than any bureaucrat will ever be, because government doesn&#39;t ask us for money or obedience whereas company in order to not go bankrupt must sell it&#39;s service/merchandise to willing customers. Of course as government influence over economy is bigger and bigger market becomes a lot more corrupted by changing incentives. Any firm would want to get monopoly in it&#39;s own niche because that usually means more profits for less work. Government makes that possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, government fucks up the flow of the market. If a company is corrupt in a true free market, people will not use that company. Another company that doesn&#39;t pull the bullshit will come out and people will use that one instead. Without government aid, a lot of the major corporations we have right now would not exist because they&#39;re so fucking bad. But government bails them out because of the revolving door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a mistake to assume you are alone in that fear. Most people fear absentee property invasions and theft, so there would of course develop a market for policing and liability of theft... if you pay an entity to protect your belongings and they fail, THEY pay. Dispute resolution organizations, which have existed forever in every form of government and group of people, would become known as either fair or unfair, and - just as in any market situation - the ones with the fairest history would get the most customers to arbitrate disputes. A company who failed to pay for their customer&#39;s losses would then be given bad ratings by reviews and 3rd party &quot;Better Business Bureau&quot; organizations. There is insurance, dispute resolution organizations, charitable consumer advocates, individual reviews... i.e. many checks and balances. A huge monopoly who gained power not through persuasively providing $Billions of value to customers, but rather through force, is something that needs eradicated ASAP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t murder people because then you&#39;d be using force to impose your will over another. You can&#39;t use force in an An-Cap society. That&#39;s breaking the non-aggression principle. If you were to break the non-aggression principle, society would deal with you as it sought fit because you initiated force. </p>

<p>People can set up states, that&#39;s fine. An-Caps just want a place where they will be exempt from those laws. Obviously there will be government in a lot of parts of the world.</p>

<p>Those <em>evil</em> businesses will fail in an an-cap society because in a true free market, it&#39;s the consumers that decide what businesses succeed and which ones don&#39;t. The reason why we have evil corporations now that succeed is because government interferes with the free market by helping the big corporations with money, laws that support those businesses, and the revolving door. If a business in a free market is bad, people will stop using it and will use the better business. The bad businesses would not be able to exploit anybody because it would fail, or be forced to meet the demands of the consumers or workers so that it doesn&#39;t fail.</p>

<p>edit: again, how is this feudalism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d put it this way, government currently holds a monopoly on fear-alleviation. Part of the appeal to govt-skeptics is precisely rooted in this fact. An anarchy would develop organizations who alleviate fear, including consumer groups who monitor restaurants (regulators), defense-minded people who would charge for securing specific geographical areas with fees (military), and local rule enforcement (police). The issue of roads, for instance, is mostly about interstate roads. Roads with high traffic would easily be able to corral money to finance maintenance since businesses and home owners want it. Anything that people actually want will be funded in an anarcho-capitalist system, whereas in government only a few people may want something, but if they have captured &quot;political&quot; power, they can force everyone to pay for their wars, their pork barrel project, their peaceful drug-use prohibition enforcement, etc.</p>

Anyhow, I am glad to see you admit that all you are advocating for is a privatized state where coercion will be privatized in defense of and coordinated by property owners.  I think that means I just won this argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, since there were few or no anarcho-capitalists in the past, that means that the word &quot;anarchy&quot; can only apply to the types of people it applied to in the past, regardless of whether or not the new people meet the criteria of the definition of the word? Did I get all that?</p>

<p>Alright, that&#39;s just not how words work. I&#39;m sorry, this is probably very upsetting for you. Would you like some fresh, home-made cookies and warm milk?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  Political movements and theories have a history.   You probably ought to call yourself an anti-state capitalist, because that makes much more sense.  Anarchy has always been anti-capitalist.  If that bothers you, then I&#39;m sorry for upsetting you.  Would you like some fresh, home-made cookies and warm milk?</p>

<p>You&#39;re right! And your anarcho-socialism/communism has a very interesting history. Seriously, go read up on it. &quot;Anarchy&quot; is a word that means &quot;a state of having no rulers&quot;. If that is too complicated for you (I doubt it is, you seem fairly intelligent for a left-anarchist, even if you don&#39;t understand these basic concepts), then anarchy is probably not for you.</p>

<p>Yes. Bring them to me, plebeian.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and you should look up the transitive property. It makes your &quot;anti-state capitalist&quot; remark pretty self-defeating.</p>
