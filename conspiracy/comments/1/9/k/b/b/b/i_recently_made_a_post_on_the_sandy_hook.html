I recently put up a post proving Sandy Hook conspiracy (which I have since deleted for the purpose of exposing this guy) and was immediately attacked by the <a href="/u/Soullessandproud">/u/Soullessandproud</a>. I really didn&#39;t find it that odd at first since I knew some people may be offended by it but days later I went to check his history. Almost all of his comments are attacking people who talk about Sandy Hook conspiracies or are talking about our right to have guns. This guy is obviously in on something. I just wanted to call him out. Seriously look at this guys comment history, it is rather creepy if you ask me. He tries to cover it up by calling people &quot;fucking retarded&quot; or &quot;a fucking faggot&quot; to blend in with internet trolls but he most definitely has an agenda here.</p>

<p>Looking back through four months of comments, there are lots about video games and The Walking Dead. He insults people over Sandy Hook and racism, but there were only a few about gun control. He says he is 19 years old and his writing and spelling are definitely consistent with that. I don&#39;t see any signs that he is anything but a typical teenager.</p>

<p>I’ll have you know they&#39;ve ranked top out of all the comments on the Internet, and they have been translated in numerous contexts on 4chan, and have over 300 confirmed variants. Navy Seal copypastas are trained in memetic warfare and are the top copypasta in the entire circlejerk arsenel. You are nothing to them but just another target. They will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this subreddit, mark my fucking words.</p>

<p>You think you can get away with saying that shit about Navy Seal copypastas over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak this copypasta is contacting it&#39;s secret network of /b/tards across the USA and your IP is being doxxed right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid.</p>

<p>Navy Seal copypastas can be anywhere, anytime, and they can confuse you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with mad-lib permutations. Not only are they extensively trained in trolling, but they have access to the entire arsenal of Anonymous and will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Internet, you little shit.</p>

<p>If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. This copypasta will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</p>

I’ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and I’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over 300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o’ swag. I’ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o’ pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o’ monsoon that’ll wipe ye off the map. You’re sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o’er seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top o’ the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and I’ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o’ the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But ye couldn’t, ye didn’t, and now ye’ll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. I’ll shit fury all over ye and ye’ll drown in the depths o’ it. You’re fish food now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is defamation?</p>

<p>Generally, defamation is a false and unprivileged statement of fact that is harmful to someone&#39;s reputation, and published &quot;with fault,&quot; meaning as a result of negligence or malice. State laws often define defamation in specific ways. Libel is a written defamation; slander is a spoken defamation.
What are the elements of a defamation claim?</p>

<p>The elements that must be proved to establish defamation are:</p>

<pre><code>a publication to one other than the person defamed;
a false statement of fact;
that is understood as

a. being of and concerning the plaintiff; and
b. tending to harm the reputation of plaintiff.
</code></pre>

<p>If the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she must also prove actual malice.
Is truth a defense to defamation claims?</p>

<p>Yes. Truth is an absolute defense to a defamation claim. But keep in mind that the truth may be difficult and expensive to prove.</p>

<p>You do not have legal precedent. </p>

<p>You do not have any way to prove that he meant to do harm to your public self. </p>

<p>In fact, he does not know who you are other than a severely sick person who sees conspiracy and butthurt at every corner when you have legitimately defamatory things to say about Government, victims.</p>

<p>The claims you have made about him can actually be made about you and your posts, class action, from the families of Sandy Hook. But I&#39;m not going to go messaging admins to find an IP of yours or your (lol) MAC address. </p>

<p>In fact, as far as you know we&#39;re all using Tor and you&#39;re going to find a non-existent IP or MAC. That is not admissable. If you have a good lawyer these days, you can get DNA evidence thrown out. </p>

<p>Enjoy your paranoia and butt-hurtedness because when you make ridiculous claims, we have a right to first amendment rights. A judge would throw out your case and your lawyer would not work on it -- they cannot stifle our first amendment rights just because you get butthurty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>AND, since I figure you are in the US because of your past comments implying that &quot;we the people expect better hoaxes for our $1 trillion.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is your lesson in FA rights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The First Amendment does not protect you from:</p>

<p>Criticism: If you&#39;re a comedian who makes a bad rape joke, people are allowed to point out that you&#39;re not funny as well as an asshole.</p>

<p>Shame: If you tweet something racist about President Obama on your public Twitter account that&#39;s connected to your first and last name, people are allowed to say that is bad.</p>

<p>The Right to Anonymity: If you take creepy photos of women without their consent and post them on Reddit, people are allowed to try and figure out who you are and post your information on the internet. No one is entitled to anonymity. It&#39;s up to you whether to make it easy for people to find you.</p>

<p>Mockery: Hi, PIKE brothers. Did you deserve to be mocked for your cheesy PG-13 photos? It doesn&#39;t matter. You put yourselves out there, which means your peers (and news outlets) have the right to LOL and comment.</p>

<p>Consequences: If you publicly express yourself in a manner that is offensive, hurtful, or just plain dumb, strangers might contact your friends/family/school/employer and tell them what you did. That is not infringing on your right to free speech; it&#39;s pointing out how you choose to exercise that right. Like the rest of the federal constitution, the First Amendment protects us from the government, not from private companies, which may be able to fire or otherwise punish you for stuff you say, even if it&#39;s outside of work. The laws protecting the free speech of private employees vary from state to state, aside from specifically protected speech like labor organizing. </p>

<p>Did you just defame your regulatory body by accusing them of spreading fake news? </p>

<p>Should your regulatory body be contacted to inform them of this gross and monstrously disgusting act of defamation? </p>

<p>If you knew what you were talking about, you would know you need to contact <em>your</em> local authorities to take your report. You would also know that reddit admins have zero obligation to give you any user&#39;s IP address. You will need a request by a judge, which you aren&#39;t gonna get since no one was threatened and no one is in any danger. You might get a judge to order one for any civil cases you may have, but...</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be easier/cheaper/less of a waste of time to just change your name here and go on? Or you could use RES and put those people on &quot;ignore&quot;.......</p>

<p>If you are gonna bring a civil suit for libel/slander (That&#39;s really the only thing I can think of that you could use for litigation here.) against a user you should know that it is on you to prove his/her words caused you financial damages or mental anguish. The accused has to prove nothing. Ain&#39;t that kinda shitty? For you I mean, not the accused.</p>

<p>Good luck! You&#39;ll need it...</p>

<p>So... are you going to threaten to sue the local law enforcement for laughing at you and hurting your feelings when they inevitably laugh at you for wanting to have someone arrested and then sue them for calling everything you say bullshit.</p>

<p>Secondly good luck at the whole tracing ip / mac address thing, IP&#39;s change and the MAC address isn&#39;t visible outside of the local network so reddit won&#39;t have access to that at all.</p>

<p>but you know if you can afford to chuck money down the toilet feel free.</p>

<p>Also considering you think that Kurt Cobain faked his death to form Weezer I&#39;d agree with the OP.</p>

If anyone did more than 5 minutes of research you would find that <a href="/u/soullessandproud">/u/soullessandproud</a> likes to go into more controversial subs and stir up shit to call people out.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a younger guy and his comment history reflects that. I feel that you yourself are a younger guy judging by this post. These types of posts have no business in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If you want to really stick it to <a href="/u/soullessandproud">/u/soullessandproud</a> then come back at him with the proper evidence or just down vote and move along.</p>

<p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> could be a great place but needs to really up the quality of it&#39;s posts. More proof (scientific studies, government reports, actual video evidence) is needed for most of the posts that come through this sub. Yeah I know it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and it&#39;s fun to bounce around ideas sometimes but when dealing with highly controversial subjects it&#39;s nice to have something to back up your views.</p>

<p>I <em>adore</em> this excuse. Makes me smile every time it comes up. You have the opportunity to expose one of the most heinous conspiracies of the last century and to reveal for the world the lengths a tyrannical government will go to in order to disarm its populace, to cast light onto a shocking ruse pulled off before the American public, but gosh, ain&#39;t nobody got time for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think any sane person needs to travel to the town to verify that it is not inhabited by paid actors. I mean, seriously, that&#39;s just fucking retarded. However, that doesn&#39;t really change the fact that there are some pretty strange oddities surrounding this event. Really, most of the official story doesn&#39;t make much sense when you start looking into it.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what happened there. All I can say for certain is that  the new gun restrictions would never have passed without this happening, and that there are holes and oddities in the story that TV gave us. I think that alone should warrant a bit of sane investigation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, if you verify that the parents are known and have been known, that shows they are not actors, which destroys a lot of the conspiracy theories.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s first assuming that nobody died in the event. I don&#39;t have enough evidence to determine that one way or another. There&#39;s been a lot of oddities surrounding the forgoing of standard procedures regarding the autopsies and the bodies though, and that&#39;s worth looking into.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t suppose it would matter much though meeting parents. If there actually was some horrific conspiracy surrounding this, I could only assume that they would be in on it, and play their roles appropriately. But again, that&#39;s really neither here nor there.</p>

<p>A coroner acting strangely doesn&#39;t mean much either. You&#39;d have to be a bit of an odd person to take up that sort of profession. However, he does say some odd things regarding the gunshots and the bullet wounds that don&#39;t seem to add up with other reports some some officials involved. </p>

<p>Again, I really don&#39;t know what happened. But I haven&#39;t been given the feeling that TV has given us the actual truth about it. A lot of testimonies don&#39;t line up. Some of the kids say truly bizzare things, and if you&#39;ve worked with kids much, it almost sounds like they have been coached at times. That&#39;s pure speculation though. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t shake the feeling though that if this were an open and shut case, well, it would be.</p>

You can&#39;t really judge anyone for speaking out on Internet about conspiracy theories, because the Internet is a Tool and  people Use it to accomplish certain things. </p>

<p>Be realistic. If Sandy Hook was a conspiracy it was one epic plan and it was perfectly executed because the whole country is now talking about gun control and the media is not questioning the story at all. If sandy hook was a conspiracy, you have to give mad props to the people who contrived this tragedy, IMO it would take a great amount of wealth,power,and influence to create and control such a horrific massacre and convince the entire world it was real. </p>

<p>That means if Sandy Hook was an inside job, a conspiracy, we are up against something or someone or a group of people, who are really powerful and willing to murder lots of kids to get what they want. And, you would definitely want to be using the Internet to bring light to the situation, all things considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a valid observation.  And we have to ask why so many posters are shrilling so much that other people have to shut up and stop asking questions. Who gains from that attitude? Those who would be embarrassed by or even lose power (control) if too many people demanded answers.</p>

<p>I see from the heavy downvoting that the Brigade probably cross-posted. You guys wear such neat clothing. Where can I get the double-lighting bolt badges and the dueling scars?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposted from before Mazlow&#39;s response. because the bury brigade did not want this visible. Tough, because I will repost once you have buried it.</p>

<p>When we see brownshirt brigades attacking discussion, it only reinforces the feeling there&#39;s truth in a lot of what&#39;s being hypothesized. The relentessness of the attacks by such as /conspiratard is more than just ordinary trolls, it&#39;s a movement to suppress inquiry.</p>

<p>Some of the attackers seem like construct personalities, to deflect accusations of organized attacks on social media to control it. Not all of them are, but we know that the US military for example has solicited bids for software to do exactly that, host a library of fake people to influence online discussion.</p>

<p>Reddit has big holes that allow manipulation (and it lacks a Bill of Rights). The internet needs a more secure form of social media that both protects privacy yet prevents easy gaming by organizations. If I knew how to do it, I&#39;d put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>Added: oh look, the troll brigade arrives. Why am I not surprised.</p>

I’ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and I’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over 300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o’ swag. I’ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o’ pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o’ monsoon that’ll wipe ye off the map. You’re sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o’er seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top o’ the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and I’ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o’ the world, ye dog.
