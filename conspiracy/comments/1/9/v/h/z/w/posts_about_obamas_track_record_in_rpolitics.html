        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-03-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/n3uromanc3r.html">n3uromanc3r</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I found a list of Obama&#39;s achievements about half a year ago (I think on <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a>) [full disclosure, I don&#39;t consider myself a &quot;libertarian&quot; per se--more of a libertarian socialist or socialist libertarian], made a few edits, and saved it for a rainy day.  During the election season, it would&#39;ve been downvoted to hell, but I knew that once the &quot;lesser evil&quot; (Romney) was out of the way, it would only be a matter of time until more so-called liberals and progressives would start getting antsy  about Obama (and it&#39;s about damn time).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been monitoring the pulse of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> to get a sense of their openness to hearing about how bad Obama <strong>actually</strong> is.</p>

<p>A couple days ago, I found the perfect situation to float the list by <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and it did quite well.  I&#39;ve posted it a few places since then.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/19qahz/obama_administration_says_president_can_use/">Here&#39;s the thread.</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, while largely a Democrat circlejerk, is, I think, open to the idea that Obama might not be the &quot;Good Guy&quot; they imagined (it took long enough).  With the drone situation on the radar of everyone there, this would be a good time for us to work together to bring some awareness to that echo chamber.</p>

<p>I&#39;d encourage anyone and everyone else to re-post the list in the thread above (or another list of your preference--whose list it is doesn&#39;t matter) wherever there are blind Obama supporters.</p>

<p>My strategy with <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is as follows; adapt procedures as you see fit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sort subreddit by newest submissions.</li>
<li>Find most popular threads posted in the last ~2 hours (I do this by noting the total number of upvotes and the upvote:downvote ratio)</li>
<li>Select the top thread or two that pertain to Obama, executive powers, etc.</li>
<li>Post list</li>
</ul>

<p>The iron is hot right now.  I hope a few of you will join me in this.</p>

<p>Apparently, the comment has now been deleted, so here&#39;s the list in its current form:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed that post originally and was quite impressed on how well it did. I think your game plan is sound but I would like to see it expanded. The problem doesn&#39;t lie with Obama alone. This goes beyond the left-right paradigm.</p>

<p>I would like people to wake up to the bigger picture, not only is the President out of line on some issues, so is the Congress and the media. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/19vg4w/msnbc_host_rachel_maddow_will_be_doing_a_ama/">Rachel Maddow is doing an AMA tomorrow</a> and I&#39;d like to see some serious questions answered.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s definitely bigger than the President, and it transcends the delusion of the left/right paradigm.</p>

<p>I have tried to note this in a few threads on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, especially in the last few days, and have been pleasantly surprised by some of the results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the trick is to definitely get in the comments early, that&#39;s why people need to browse /new. My only concern is, when appealing to certain crowds the information needs to be sourced better.</p>

<p>That means NO homemade youtube vids(for the most part), no blog type sites and no opinion pieces. People need to start using <a href="http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en">Google Scholar</a> to reference studies and whitepapers, search for <a href="http://www.ntis.gov/">PDF reports</a> straight from the <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pub1.html">government sites</a> themselves, use <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/">their own information against them</a>.</p>

<p>I also disagree with other posters, to not take the fight directly to them. The time is now to wake people up about real issues.</p>

<p>We are essentially at war with every country. WAR. It isn&#39;t pretty. It never was.  It never will be. </p>

<p>You all act likeany person would be better at being president. </p>

<p>You all do not mention the good things our president has done. Progressive action for our LGBTq community, Violence against women act, which Republicans voted against, the dream act, the recent immigration bill. </p>

<p>Sure forget those, because he uses bombs. For as intellectual as you all act, you sure don&#39;t think much.</p>

<p>EDIT: You can downvote me all you want, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m wrong. You bash <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> because of the &quot;hivemind&quot; but look at it here? Just as bad. This sub has went to hell with nutjobs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious, you say we&#39;re &quot;at war&quot; with everyone. Could you tell me exactly where congress approved such acts, links and sources would be nice.</p>

<p>Is Obama the worst president, probably not. Could someone else to better, maybe. The only problem we have to work with what we have now and it&#39;s our job as the American public to keep the President and the Congress as honest as possible. </p>

<p>Obama has made great advances in the LGBT community and with other social issues but these things are nothing without the Constitution. Every little piece of our freedom that is chipped away now, results in more problems down the road.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re confused about most people around here. Most of us see past the left-right paradigm. We try to expose all sides of corruption,  I think you should also try to do the same.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any point to fighting them on their shill turf.  Just tell the truth and you&#39;ll find a lot of people want to hear it... but real humans is not what you&#39;ll find on the default subreddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s analyze all of these idiotic Fox News talking points of yours</p>

<ul>
<li>Obama tried to reform the Patriot Act.  <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/179/revise-the-patriot-act-to-increase-oversight-on-go/">Blocked by republicans</a></li>
<li>Troops in Afghanistan are down to pre-surge levels. Also, he has the lowest number of troops deployed around the world of anytime over the past 10 years.</li>
<li>When Obama came into office, the U.S. had approximately 190,000 troops deployed in the two war zones; by the third year in office, he had less than 100,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. </li>
<li>The NDAA is the military budget. Now, there are are problems with the NDAA, and Obama agrees with you on them:</li>
<li>When signing the 2013 NDAA, Obama states he will prevent indefinite detention with an executive order, just like he did in 2012 <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/550698/2013ndaa-stm-rel-pdf.pdf">source</a> </li>
<li>In 2012, Obama issues Executive Order for Terror Suspects to stay in Civilian control rather than Mandatory Military Detention <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203833004577251562112253078.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal source</a> </li>
<li>In 2012, Obama &#39;Vetoed&#39; Indefinite Military Detention in NDAA. Legal experts agree that the waiver rules that President Obama has just issued will effectively end military detentions for non-citizen terrorism suspects <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/03/1070450/--Obama-just-Vetoed-Indefinite-Military-Detention-in-NDAA">source</a> </li>
<li>How Obama Ignored The NDAA&#39;s Military Custody Provision- Obama&#39;s procedures have read this law virtually out of existence <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/02/how_obama_ignored_the_ndaas_military_custody_provision.php?ref=fpb">source</a> </li>
<li>All Republicans vote yet again to prevent Obama from closing Guantanamo: here&#39;s the votes link <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;amp;session=2&amp;amp;vote=00212">source</a> </li>
<li>This is Obama&#39;s signing statement about Guantanamo: &quot;The Congress designed these sections, and has here renewed them once more, in order to foreclose my ability to shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. I continue to believe that operating the facility weakens our national security by wasting resources, damaging our relationships with key allies, and strengthening our enemies.&quot; <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/550698-2013ndaa-stm-rel-pdf.html">source</a> </li>
<li>Obama is ready to ignore key provisions of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that aim to block him from closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba--just like he did in 2012 <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/01/03/obama-prepares-to-ignore-ndaa-provisions-blocking-guantanamo-closure/">source</a> </li>
<li>Obama has attempted three times to end indefinite detention, and all three times have been blocked by republicans. In 2010 he tried to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/us/politics/26gitmo.html?_r=1">close Guantanamo but it was blocked</a>...in 2011 he tried to move prisoners to civilian courts, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/detainees/military_commissions/index.html">but Republicans blocked it</a> . However, republicans are using this to get people to be against Obama, so now people think Obama is all pro-indefinite detention. Remember in November of 2011 when the senate voted for indefinite detention, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/29/senate-votes-to-let-military-detain-americans-indefinitely_n_1119473.html">and Obama vetoed it</a> ? And finally when he used the NDAA to end indefinite detention, a liberal Chris Hedges, actually sued his administration over it. </li>
<li>Bush started killing Americans with drones in 2002 <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/holder-speak-targeted-killings-americans-192324573--abc-news.html">source</a> </li>
<li>Al Qaeda&#39;s second in command, Anwar al-Awlaki, was an enemy combatant who killed Americans with impunity because he was an American citizen, until Obama used a drone to kill him. Good</li>
<li>It has taken Obama five years to kill 3,000 people with drones. Bush killed that many people <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/">in his first two days in Iraq</a>. Infact, Bush is responsible for roughly 105,000-110,000 civilian deaths. 
This means for <strong>every 1 person Obama kills with a drone, Bush killed 33</strong></li>
<li>A pinpoint drone strike is less intrusive of other countries&#39; sovereignty than other military ways to target al Qaeda. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/31/politics/obama-pakistan/index.html?hpt=hp_t3">source</a> </li>
<li>The moment Obama started using drones, the number of deaths caused by America&#39;s forces dropped form 43 a day to under 5 a day <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">source</a> this is because drone strikes cause far less collateral damage.</li>

<li>Obama violated the war powers act? Sooo let me get this straight: The French led a NATO attack, and somehow that means Obama violated the war powers act? Just so you know, the French don&#39;t have to get American approval for military action. Your links are opinion pages</li>
<li>NATO takes over air operations as CIA works the ground in Libya. Following U.N. Security Council resolution 1973, allowing member states to take all necessary measures -- &quot;while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form&quot; -- to protect civilians under the threat of attack in Libya. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/31/libya.war/index.html?hpt=T1">source</a> </li>
