<p>I&#39;m not 100% sure that it was a hoax, and I&#39;ve been swayed back and forth many times. What scares me the most however, is that future visits to the moon will be halted in order to conserve the presumed lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The moon landing wasn&#39;t a hoax, and it&#39;s pretty insulting to scientists that you think we can&#39;t land there. Honestly, if the government was willing to consistently fund us as well as they did during the Cold War, we would have a lot more to show. </p>

<p>Instead, what do we have, idiots in Congress who put in some money, only take it back out at the last moment. For instance, the linear supercollider that is just now a hole in Texas, or somewhere in the middle of America? What about how funding was randomly pulled away from plasma programs to fund ITER instead of making it a separate funding? </p>

<p>So, no, the American government won&#39;t do that, and any country that decides to land on the moon may or may not mess with the original site beyond checking it out for funsies. In addition, who the fuck will stop them from doing that if we&#39;re paying other countries for time on their shuttles anyway? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely believe several moon landings have indeed occurred, but that we&#39;ve never seen pieces of the real, unedited video footage of them until recently (thanks internet!). There would be dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of real footage total, and the public has seen maybe, what like less than an hour or two total of various 1-3 min clips? - and any clips/images we do see are generally a mix of either old training video, possibly real but edited video/stills, or real but lacking anomalies anyway so its safe to release. I read a report somewhere that the NSA had a separate feed to the first Apollo astronauts, and that if any alien contact was made or observed, there would be a latency period to switch the main video feeds to previously-prepared footage (most likely from training exercises). I believe the original 1969 broadcast footage that was aired publicly is fake, but I do believe the astronauts were actually there. I&#39;ve heard many <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z75PSQ-MiUs">transmissions</a> (first begins around 1:40) as well from astronauts regarding alien craft, so there&#39;s definitely reason to suspect <em>something</em> occurred on the moon that was instantly deemed classified and covered for. I mean, Edgar Mitchell <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvvgdxBocfc">says</a> aliens and these <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vshlUbWz2zY">craft</a> exist and have for a long time, so there&#39;s no reason to doubt his testimony.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve found interesting though: our basic physics books always said the moon had gravity 1/6th that of Earth based on its estimated mass? Well, I read a rumor that the Moon <em>actually</em> has 40-60% of Earth&#39;s gravity (not 16-17%), and based upon viewing lunar footage, based upon the astronauts&#39; movements themselves, it seems that 40-60% seems more accurate. Makes me definitely believe more and more that Gravity is an electromagnetic side-effect (as Tesla put it: standing longitudinal electric-waves in the ether), and completely independent of mass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in a lot of crazy shit, but the moon hoax is not one of them at this time.
Not sure why I was downvoted. Here is what they do tamrix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Using these mirrors,&quot; explains Alley, &quot;we can &#39;ping&#39; the moon with laser pulses and measure the Earth-moon distance very precisely. This is a wonderful way to learn about the moon&#39;s orbit and to test theories of gravity.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works: A laser pulse shoots out of a telescope on Earth, crosses the Earth-moon divide, and hits the array. Because the mirrors are &quot;corner-cube reflectors,&quot; they send the pulse straight back where it came from. &quot;It&#39;s like hitting a ball into the corner of a squash court,&quot; explains Alley. Back on Earth, telescopes intercept the returning pulse--&quot;usually just a single photon,&quot; he marvels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either that or.....</p>

<p>Something happened up there.</p>

<p>They found something up there, that they dont want anyone to know about.</p>

<p>There is a reason no one has ever gone back.</p>

<p>There is a reason the USA descended into fascism after the moon landings.</p>

<p>They found something up there. </p>

<p>When the first man climbed Mt Everest. It was historic! Now, its a tourist trip.</p>

<p>When men first flew across the Atlantic? Millions followed.</p>

<p>When the first men dove to the depths of the Ocean? Thousands followed.</p>

<p>The depths of African jungles? The Mysteries of South America? Antartica? The North Pole? One man went. Throngs followed.</p>

<p>But the Moon?</p>

<p>Half a CENTURY ago.. Men landed. And NO ONE has been back since? Not the Soviet Union? Not the Russian Empire? Not the Chinese? Not Japan? Not the UK? Not France? Not Germany? No one? Not one WORLD POWER? EVER?</p>

<p>WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS IDIOTIC STORY?</p>

<p>Either they never went? OR.... They found something BAD up there.</p>

<p>It turned the most free country in the world into fascists.</p>

<p>It made them afraid to go back.</p>

<p>And NO ONE has ever gone back.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I THE FOULBASTARD WILL SPEND THE REST OF MY NATURAL LIFE FINDING OUT WHY. ON THIS YOU HAVE MY PROMISE.</p>

<p>Its because they never went to the moon and it was a hoax and even 50 years later no one has the technology to go there and the first mission back to the moon is scheduled for 2020, which would be over 60 years that no one could go there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing will happen, because I can almost 100% sy that the moonlanding wasn&#39;t a hoax.</p>

<p>Honestly though, I don&#39;t know what to think about that conspiracy. On one hand, the information is out there, and rather soild unless the CIA managed to either break the laws of physics, or work out how to put the entire &#39;set&#39; in a vacuum, both of which would probably be harder than just landing on the moon. </p>

<p>On the other hand, this conspiracy is simply a misapplication of science, something that is entirely understandable. Unlike others which are failed logic (&#39;9/11&#39;) or just plain nuts/no proof/ignoring Occam&#39;s Razor (LAZORS IN SPACE, Lizard people etc etc)</p>

<p>Also, just off the top of my head, here&#39;s various problems with the official Apollo story:</p>

<ul>
<li>cosmic &amp; solar radiation would&#39;ve killed all the astronauts and fogged all the camera film</li>
<li>no evidence of thrust on Apollo 17 <a href="http://youtu.be/cOdzhQS_MMw">liftoff</a></li>
<li>the Apollo spaceships &amp; spacesuits offered no protection against micro-meteorites</li>
<li>no evidence of high-energy particles on any of the Apollo rolls of film</li>
<li>no other country has sent any living organism to the moon since Apollo - despite technology getting much much better</li>
<li>the first time any LM liftoff engine was ever tested was on the moon. </li>
<li>the best current pictures we have from NASA are from <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-11.html">far away</a> despite the fact that satellites in earth orbit can read headlines from a newspaper</li>
</ul>

<p>Your hand waving does not impress me. How much average radiation per hour would the astronauts experience in deep space? What&#39;s the average number of gamma particles per square inch in deep space? Why didn&#39;t the solar radiation destroy the camera film on the moon? What protection did the spaceship offer against solar flares? What amount of radiation per minute is considered harmless? How much fuel is necessary for a trans-earth injection burn? These are not questions with &quot;basic&quot; answers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2: Nope</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More hand waving. Point out which rocket in the film is releasing a hypergolic mixture. Also, why are sparks and flame visible in the oxygen free environment?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3: The answer to that was found in 1946 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple_shield">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple_shield</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No Whipple shields on the spacesuits. If any astronaut was hit by a micrometeorite, their space suit would have punctured and all their bodily fluids would have boiled away. Moreover, in all the Apollo footage we see astronauts falling. Why were none of them concerned with puncturing their suit and dying?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4: There was a lot of tape not seen, and see 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the Apollo pictures have been published at the <a href="http://www.apolloarchive.com/apollo_gallery.html">Apollo journal</a>. Any camera on the moon would have been bathed in radiation - as the moon has no atmosphere. All pictures should show signs of radiation damage - naturally, most of them don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5: Simple reason is there&#39;s no reason to go back. While we could go back if we wanted to, since there&#39;s no longer a cold war there&#39;s no incentive to do so aside from exploration, which has sadly taken a back seat to other issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No reason to go back? You&#39;re saying that we can land 6 times on any foreign body and learn all there is to know? This is a poor explanation. Why do we keep sending up satellites if there&#39;s no reason to go back? Why did bush make a new commitment to go to the moon (subsequently canceled by Obama) if there&#39;s no reason to go back?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6: So?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From an engineering standpoint, you don&#39;t want the first time you test a piece of equipment to be when you&#39;re using it in the field. The idea that an untested piece of equipment worked perfectly in unknown conditions every time is hard to believe. Moreover, the hypergolic fuel mixture they used was so corrosive, that they had to replace each engine after use. Thus, each LM liftoff engine was only used once, never tested - and the first time it was ever fired was on the moon. That stretches credulity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7: Those satellites don&#39;t exist. The best we have is the hubble telescope, which is A: Being used for better things, and B: Not very good looking at close distances due to how everything is spinning around. And even if they did exist, the distance between orbit and earth, and orbit and the moon is far far larger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My point is, we can make satellites with far greater resolution than the current LRO.</p>

<p>Other things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All the original tapes, telemetry data and original mission recordings were deleted. Why wasn&#39;t the raw data from the greatest feat of human engineering kept in a safe location?</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of computing power on the Apollo spaceships was about 32k. That&#39;s about the computing power of a pocket calculator. Why didn&#39;t these primitive circuits get overloaded by the magnetism of the Van Allen radiation belts?</p></li>
<li><p>The first Saturn V rocket test to orbit the moon was manned. This means the first mammals to orbit the moon were human! No dogs or monkeys were sent up first.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did Van Braun take a trip to Antarctica in 1967? (Antarctica, of course, being one place on Earth that has lots of moon rocks.) Moreover, if the Apollo astronauts brought back over 750lbs of moon rocks - why was the moon rock given to the Dutch by the Apollo 11 astronauts a piece of <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32581790/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/moon-rock-museum-just-petrified-wood/">petrified wood</a>. Moreover, if weight was such a concern for the Apollo astronauts, how did they account for the unknown weight of the moon rocks ahead of time?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On and on it goes... Any scientist should be gravely concerned about the Apollo record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one knows. Only a few NASA ex employees have come out over the last 20 or so years because they figured they were at the end of the road and decided to tell someone what really happened that day of the moon landing. Most people denied it and called them crazy and then poof. Gone. Hopefully I can find the site again with names and dates.. but no one has to believe them. The sixth man on the moon was interviewed and he had some pretty interesting things to say about extraterrestrials. I myself have seen some amazing and I am pretty sure out of this world stuff in the sky. My friend Staci and I witnessed what appeared to be two pyramids pressed together on the bottom of each other to form a diamond that was spinning clockwise slowly. It had a green/cyan hue and it hovered for about 5 minutes while moving due north and then vanished. We didn&#39;t know what to think except for jumping up and down yelling we saw something together. It was a good moment in our friendship.</p>
