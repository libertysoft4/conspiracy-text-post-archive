They produce a laser for the US govt, so powerful it can easily cut a tank in half..  ..from space.  If someone can find some verifying info, that would be great.  But I talk with researchers daily who confirm this.  And as you probably already imagine, it&#39;s up there already.  &quot;Prepare to be assimilated.&quot; </p>

<p>EDIT: I am <strong>NOT</strong> a fackin scientist, guy.  I am however enjoying the technical conversation and feasibility aspect of weaponized satellites. 
There are rooms and areas at the facility which have high levels of security, with a short list of scientists who may enter.  I hear, large contributions from our govt funds much of these R&amp;D areas.  I really wish I knew more/could share more.</p>

<p>I stroll through clean rooms surrounded by hundreds of suited up little workers(clean suits, masks, nets, booties, ect) and I can&#39;t help but occasionally sing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APj2ArUy6v4">this</a> in my head/out loud.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>they might be so advanced that they think they&#39;re invincible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  They&#39;ll be so advanced that they&#39;ll understand that 1) as part of The All which created and indeed <em>is</em> the universe itself, they <em>are</em> indeed invincible - as are you, as am I, as are we all.  However, 2) they will also understand that as individual, physical manifestations of The All, they <em>aren&#39;t</em> invincible.  Non the less, I also wouldn&#39;t doubt that they will still have sufficiently advanced technology for them to <em>seem</em> &quot;invincible&quot; to our puny minds - even though they themselves will in all likelihood understand very much that they are not, and would not take their ephemerality for granted.</p>

<p>Compared to the average lifespan of a Mayfly, human beings live for eons.  Even with that, however, human beings aren&#39;t stupid enough to think that we are (physically) invincible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or they may have evolved away from violence, as surely any advanced civilization must.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes sir.  This is very possibly more like it.  After all, just think about humanity.  In order for the human species to live for billions of years, it will have to master coexistence - something we haven&#39;t been very good at yet.  We won&#39;t be able to live for very long as a species without developing greatly in the way of peace and effective communication, etc.  It would seem that any advanced civilization that is sufficiently old likely GOT that old by mastering cooperation and peaceful living.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we are fucking mad monkeys with nukes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds about absolutely right, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>while i don&#39;t believe in space laz0rs (the amount of energy required to power something like that would require a huge solar panel array or nuclear reactor that any amateur astronomer looking through a potato could easiliy see), i used to work for a defense contractor and definitely got to see some cool technologies that are &#39;on the cusp&#39;</p>

<p>i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the NSA and/or some of the other alphabet agencies have quantum computers. which means they are able to crunch a lot data they collect through ECHELON (and possibly even crack &#39;secure&#39; encryption standards)</p>

<p>also, there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ning_Li_(physicist">a professor from arkansas</a> who claimed to develop an &#39;anti-gravity&#39; technology in her research at the university. soon afterward, she left to form her own company to further develop and market the breakthrough. one of the guys in <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread331108/pg1">this thread</a> was able to locate a contract between her firm and the US govt. shortly thereafter, the trail goes cold and little is known about her whereabouts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely true.  I&#39;ve been working here for over 6 years, and in that time, laser modules have shrank and become much more efficient/powerful.  At an alarming rate as well.  For example; A clean room will be needed, designed, engineered, and built, but by the time of completion, the process and needs of researchers will have changed completely.  Constant advancements and breakthroughs... It seems like a great career path for some up-and-coming geniuses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, for sure.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to think that there would be other problems with attacking  ground-based targets from space, though. A laser platform would likely depend on the same things your average surveillance satellite does, namely ideal &#39;windows&#39; for attacking. Perfect timing, atmospheric conditions, and target placement, in order to properly aim the beam. Before the tank or whatever is cut in half and exploding, the satellite has moved too far away to keep the beam on-target, due to it&#39;s own speed/inertia as it orbits the Earth. Lasers can be countered pretty easily by reflective materials, as well.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t see it being practical from space yet. The target moves 5 feet and there goes your kill until the satellite can try for another pass on the next orbit or two.</p>

<p>Deployed on planes, sure, but we&#39;re a long ways away from having our orbital Death Ray.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite a bit.</p>

<p>Per my understanding, beam dispersion gets wider in proportion to the distance involved and is compounded by atmospheric elements such as water vapor and whatnot. Meaning that cutting a tank in half from space is really not that easy to do. Power requirements rise in proportion to the targets distance as well, in order to compensate for beam dispersion.</p>

<p>An orbital or atmospheric target such as a satellite or ICBM would require much less power to disrupt or destroy than a ground-based target. </p>

<p>My science and physics courses were a <em>long</em> time ago, however, hence why I asked my question. ;)</p>

Range of that particular system was &quot;In the hundreds of kilometers&quot;.

<p>There are several reasons a laser like that fires such a short pulse, not least of which is heat dissipation. However, since power is energy/time, you can increase the power output by lowering the time value. Thats why pulsed lasers have such high power outputs. </p>

<p>Yea, that is 500 Terrawatts, or several thousand times the amount of power the entire united state uses in a year. Every second. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s only fired for petaseconds at a time.</p>

<p>Either this secret government of evil has managed to find a power source that makes the laws of physics sit in the corner and and weep, or the OP is full of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>However with all this secret technology the laws of physics still need to abided by.</p>

<p>Meaning if you want a laser that outputs 500 tw, you need to find a way to add 500 tw to the machine. (well... more than that, due to the second law of thermodynamics.)</p>

<p>And again, if the &#39;secret government of evil&#39; has managed to make something that disregards the laws of physics, I can think of a million better ways to use it than a giant space laser.</p>

<p>LAW OF PHYSICS CAN&#39;T BE BROKEN.</p>

<p>You can have all the special technology you want, but you can&#39;t get more energy output then you input.</p>

<p>And yea, I&#39;m sure they research the possibility of putting lasers on spaceships. They research loads of nutty ideas (moon bases, bat bombs, etc etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.jpg</p>

<p>GPS works by using a network of around 13 satellites that all broadcast their current position (In laymans terms). Your GPS picks up these different signals and works out your position based on the power of each individual signal. The idea that GPS works by tracking you individually like a laser would need to is laughable. </p>
