        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have a very good friend, one of my best in fact, I have known him since 8th grade, I am now a junior in college, so for a good 5-6 years we have been very close, I trust the guy with my life and do not doubt what he has told me.<br/>
He told me this story very early on in our friendship and only now have I been really wondering if there is any truth to the claims he has made.<br/>
For anonymity sake we will call my friend Jimmy.
Jimmy moved from a town in Nevada during 8th grade.  His father was a high ranking marine, not sure of the rank, but if this gets a response I will follow up.<br/>
He got honorably discharged around the time he moved out here.  He claims his father had a high clearance and worked with individuals involved with, or at Area 51, S-4, Groom Lake facility... etc... you get the point.<br/>
He recalls one night before he moved that his dad was packing up some old marine stuff when he pulled a book out of his bag, Jimmy saw the book, but not the inside, his dad flipped out, said nothing, and left the house, not returning for a couple of hours.<br/>
His dad told his wife that somehow this book, which has something to do with extraterrestrials, and only 2 copies of which were made, one at S-4, and one at the White House, ended up in his belongings, and it had no business being there at all, we are talking highly classified information that would likely get someone killed.<br/>
Anyways supposedly the father left deep into the desert, ripped up the book, burned it, and buried the remains in the desert.  We are too cautious to ask his father anything about it.  But I will soon.
If anyone knows ANYTHING about what this could possibly be related to, I will do my best to follow up and gather more information about it.
some background info</p>

<p>*Jimmys dad suffers from intense cluster headaches and migraines</p>

<p>*Talks in his sleep, some of which I have personally heard, when I say talk, I mean he spouts gibberish, gibberish that sounds like a gutteral language, very dirty sounding and very foreign sounding</p>

<p>*He NEVER talks about anything military related
*He is not a whackjob, and is, at least in my opinion, a very trustworthy person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Bill Cooper. This friend&#39;s dad is not the only high level military personnel to be made privy to supposedly official documentation of extraterrestrial affairs -- Bill Cooper was shown similar documentation. He later deduced it was false evidence, and that many high ranking personnel were subjected to similar material. He concluded the alien stuff was fake, but that the US gov is planning to orchestrate a scenario in which the aliens appear to be real. His belief is that this documentation was shown to people intentionally so they would become whistleblowers and spread this false information as though it was true. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQZBU4RGuTY">Here is a video that summarizes some of the things he claims about it.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be willing to believe there was a classified book, but the whole &quot;burned it/buried it in the desert&quot; (WHICH ONE IS IT?) is stupid.  Why would he do that, and if he did, why would you know about it?  A high-ranking Marine isn&#39;t just going to fuck up like that.</p>

<p>I have 2 friends I&#39;ve known for around 13 years that are in the military and they won&#39;t tell me shit.</p>

<p>As far as weird noises in his sleep, you just described what my girlfriend does in her sleep.</p>

<p>The problem with this post is OP <em>can&#39;t</em> deliver.  <em>If</em> his friend&#39;s father actually <em>did</em> accidentally divulge or expose sensitive data to his family, that is one thing.  But to answer questions asked by a (in the government&#39;s eyes) random civilian is really a ludicrous prospect.  This post is the kind of baseless junk that can harm the community, I think.  </p>

<p>So, OP, what I would have done before posting (just like the guy that falsely accused Zach Braff of not tipping and trying not to pay at a restaurant because his FRIENDS TOLD HIM it was true) is due some research and attempt to acquire some data on the topic rather than releasing your wild fart of a speculation into the air.</p>

<p>But I will say, though I don&#39;t think you&#39;re completely full of shit, this is a time-wasting venture you&#39;ve put before us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book is probably documents on classified aircraft experimentation taking in places of these facilities,</p>

<p>remember area 51 is used mainly for testing new aircrafts, however its not hard to imagine that this place also had a dual purpose for something else, after all we dont know how big it is.</p>

<p>However I wonder if Jimmys father knows about Bob Lazar</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-4_(facility)#Claims_regarding_Area_51">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-4_(facility)#Claims_regarding_Area_51</a></p>

<p>He worked at the S4 site of Area 51, &#39;claims&#39; to know about exterrestial technology.</p>

<p>according to him &quot; S4 serves as a hidden military location for the study and research of extraterrestrial spacecraft, or flying saucers using reverse engineering. Lazar says he saw nine different extraterrestrial vehicles there and has provided detailed information on the mode of propulsion and other technical details of a disc-shaped vehicle he called the sport model.&quot;</p>

<p>So if we follow this as truth that means Jimmys father has been working with some funky alien stuff.</p>

<p>However all I did was a 5 minute research look into on your topic it would be interesting to see what this guy knows about S-4.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt that there would only be two copies of the book and that such a book wouldn&#39;t be under lock and key 24/7. Registered Mail that any Joe Blow sends to Joe Sixpack gets better security treatment than this supposed book. Sounds like horseshit.</p>

<p>If a book like that goes missing, A.) it&#39;s immediately known and B.) people look for it and who might have it until it&#39;s found. Sounds like birdshit.</p>

<p>Such a book would not likely have a cover that accurately describes it&#39;s contents. Nor would it be a completed print with binding as it would likely need intel added to it as it becomes available. Sounds like dogshit.</p>

<p>Methinks you got splattered with trollshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay everyone needs to cut the bullshit about it being potentially bullshit! Of course it very well could be but I have no reason to lie for karma or attention, I wanted some insight from members of the community.  Not inflated opinions from people looking to discredit automatically, isn&#39;t that what r/conspiracy is about?  This was obviously posted on a throwaway so quit tripping out. I will ask my friend today what other info he can get out of his dad, to clarify, the claim was the book was burned, remains thrown into a hole, buried, obviously there are details that can be simplified. I HAVEN&#39;T HEARD IT FIRST HAND.  If you have any questions you want jimmy to specifically ask his dad let me know and I will continue following up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell him to ask his dad:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did the document/book state that off world beings (ETs) have been on this planet?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, are they still here right now?</p></li>
<li><p>How many different species of beings is he/the book/the military aware of?</p></li>
<li><p>Has he himself ever seen any being from another planet?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the military hide this information from the government?</p></li>
<li><p>Does he know if there are currently any beings living on the moon?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for making this OP.  I hope you can get some of these questions answered.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One point of contention to the story, or really a question.  Lets say there are books that are so classified that if someone unauthorized were to read, the government would be forced to kill them.  </p>

<p>Why in the world would anyone, no matter their rank, be allowed to take them home???</p>

<p>The risk that would entail would be unnecessary.  Someone could break into their car, or their house, or they could get into an accident and someone could mistakenly see it.  These are just the random scenarios that I can think of on the spot, which would be reason enough in my mind that something with presumably &quot;national secrets&quot; wouldn&#39;t be allowed to leave the compound of a highly secretive facility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that book could have factual evidence of everything from alien bases and their infamous underground labs... or be ledgers detailing the payoffs, bribes, padded budgeting of building or supply contracting in the base Dad was, with higher-up names spelled right there, and of course that would be something quite dangerous to have, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could be true, but what makes me so adamant about finding more information about it is that I&#39;m the only person he&#39;s ever told, and this was after I asked him what his dad did in nevada, I had to grill him about it for a while before he even told me he was in the service. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a book called the Philadelphia Experiment, and it talks about a book that the military anonymously received talking about the science and results of the experiment, with the wording and details to suggest the author was involved, or close to someone that was. High ranking government officials then made notes throughout the book and made very few copies. The book might have mentioned 4 copies (it&#39;s been awhile since I read it) but I&#39;m sure there are varying reports of how many copies of such evidence would exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re making the accusation how about you prove yourself right? Plenty of people are calling BS on this story (most in fact). Conspiracy theories range from easily believable, supported, to batshit insane and this sub has all of em&#39;.
