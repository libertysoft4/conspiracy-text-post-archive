<blockquote>
<p>However, contrary to repeated allegations by Israeli officials of the use of “human shields”, Amnesty International found no evidence that Hamas or other Palestinian fighters directed the movement of civilians to shield military objectives from attacks. It found no evidence that Hamas or other armed groups forced residents to stay in or around buildings used by fighters, nor that fighters prevented residents from leaving buildings or areas which had been commandeered by militants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would think that people on r/conspiracy of all places would realize that Amnesty International is the &quot;official&quot; story. It is part of the official narrative and it is a part of the mainstream media. It is amazing how many people here jump on the bandwagon when it adheres to their own views regarding Israel (confirmation bias) when they would otherwise reject the source out of hand. Especially considering that Amnesty International is a pro-international, pro-UN group. If anything says &quot;NWO&quot; or &quot;One World Government&quot; it is NGOs like AI.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t see anyone posting the Amnesty International reports on the Palestinian Authority or other human rights violations being committed by Israel&#39;s neighbours:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we talking about the 2009 war? Because if so there is plenty of evidence of Hamas and other Palestinian groups using human shields. In a report from <a href="http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/D7E5DD676BDCF47C8525760B004A4870">human rights watch</a>, it says that Palestinians did use human shields and fired from populated areas. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>According to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/hamas-tried-to-hijack-ambulances-during-gaza-war/2009/01/25/1232818246374.html">this</a> Palestinian ambulance driver for the red crescent, &#39;Hamas tried to hijack ambulances and lure them into battle.&#39; </p></li>
<li><p>And from this <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/01/19/hamas-and-its-discontents.html">new article</a>, you have this quote &quot;Talal Safadi, an official in the leftist Palestinian People&#39;s Party, said that resistance fighters were firing from positions all around the hospital.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>The Palestinian Authority <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/palestinian-authority-hamas-used-gaza-hospitals-as-detention-centers-1.269614">claimed</a> that Hamas had taken over hospitals too. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, are my eyes deceiving me or does is this not a rocket being <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/A_rocket_fired_from_a_civilian_area_in_Gaza_towards_civilian_areas_in_Southern_Israel.jpg">fired from a residential neighborhood</a> in Gaza?

<p>Why did the 6 million figure not fluctuate after Auschwitz lowered it&#39;s Jewish death toll of 4 million, to 1.35 million? </p>

<p>Because that sign was never a legitimate representation of the number of deaths. It was put there by the soviets, and was replaced when Poland gained independence from them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am well aware of its illegitimacy, and the events that lead to its subsequent change.</p>

<p>That fact remains, those 4 million deaths were included in the total original figure of 6 million.  It wasn&#39;t until after this new deficit, that the totals at the other camps were inflated accordingly.  Yet, compared to documented accounts, the numbers still don&#39;t add up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Wikipedia, 3.8 million people died in the following &quot;extermination camps...80 to 90% were Jews or half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust&quot;:</p>

<p>Auschwitz 1.4 million deaths X 85% or 1.2 million Jews</p>

<p>Treblinka 870,000 deaths X 85% or 740,000 Jews</p>

<p>Belzek 600,000 deaths X 85% or 510,000 Jews</p>

<p>Jasenovak 600,000 deaths X 85% or (Few Jews)</p>

<p>Chelmno 320,000 deaths X 85% or 272,000 Jews</p>

<p>Majdanek 360,000 deaths X 85% or 306,000 Jews</p>

<p>Sobibor 250,000 deaths X 85% or 212,000 Jews</p>

<p>But when you read the Wikipedia articles on the individual camps, significant discrepancies begin to emerge, as shown in the following abstracts:</p>

<p>In 1989 Auschwitz corrected its monuments and reduced the number of deaths from 4 million to 1.1 million yet the 6 million total never changed (the savings at Auschwitz were picked up in other camps). Also, the International Red Cross and detailed German death records indicate that only about 150,000 died at Auschwitz of whom 30,000 were Jews. Wikipedia ignores or dismisses such records. (Compare with 1.2 million above.)</p>

<p>In Treblinka, The Höfle Telegram listed 713,555 Jews killed up to the end of December 1942. With the addition of 1943 transports listed in Yitzhak Arad&#39;s book, one may arrive at the figure 800,000. (Compare with 740,000 above.)</p>

<p>At Belzek, at least 434,500 Jews were killed. (Compare with 510,000 above.)</p>

<p>The Jasenovac Memorial Area keeps a list of 69,842 names of Jasenovac victims: 39,580 Serbs, 14,599 Roma, 10,700 Jews, 3,462 Croats as well as people of some other ethnicities. (&quot;The world&#39;s eminent authority on Holocaust victims, Yad Vashem Center, claims 600,000.&quot;)</p>

<p>In the Chelmno camp, at least 152,000 people were killed, mainly Jews from the Lódz Ghetto. (Compare with 272,000 above.)</p>

<p>According to the official Majdanek State Museum about 300,000 inmates passed through the camp, over 40% Jews. The most recent research by the Majdanek Museum indicates that there were 78,000 victims, 59,000 of whom were Jews. (Compare with 306,000 above.)</p>

<p>At least 250,000 people were killed in Sobibór. The victims were mostly Jews from Poland.</p>

<p>The deaths listed for the remaining sites do not come close to another 3.8 million, much less 80 to 90% Jews. Some samples are:</p>

<p>The total number of deaths at Buchenwald is estimated at 56,545 with little mention of Jews.</p>

<p>At Bergen-Belsen, an estimated 50,000 people died there, up to 35,000 of them dying of typhus in the first few months of 1945.</p>

<p>Of the roughly 30,000 wartime victims at Sachsenhausen, most were Russian prisoners of war.</p>

<p>At Maly Trostenets Yad Vashem currently estimates the number killed as 65,000 while German historian Christian Gerlach estimates the number to be in the range of 40,000-60,000, mostly Jews from Minsk.</p>

<p>At Ravensbruk, about 30,000 to 40,000 women and children perished there, mostly Polish, few Jews.</p>

<p>Various historians place the total death toll in the four main camps of Mauthausen, Gusen I, Gusen II and Gusen III at between 55,000 and 60,000.</p>

<p>Over 200,000 prisoners were housed in Dachau of which nearly one-third were Jews; 32,099 prisoners are believed to have died in the camp and almost another 10,000 in its subcamps, primarily from disease.</p>

<p>At Dachau signs now read that the facilities were never used as gas chambers to murder anyone. In fact, there&#39;s no evidence that any &quot;death camps&quot; used poison gas, gas chambers or gas ovens to kill. Yet Wikipedia lists millions of Jews murdered in every camp in poison gas chambers that could hold thousands of people at a time. This is necessary to account for the number of deaths, &quot;75% of all European Jews&quot;.</p>

<p>The Holocaust narrative has turned into Holocaustianity. Basically a government backed religion with strict dogma and high priests like Elie Wiesel. Don&#39;t forget the Holocaust temples all over the world now. </p>

<p>Nice way to conflate two different things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The laws against Holocaust denial are wrong.</strong> People should be able to be idiots in public, even about the Holocaust.</li>
<li><strong>The Holocaust happened. Eleven million people, six million of them Jews, died due to deliberate plans made and carried out by the Nazi government.</strong> The only way to question this is to ignore mountains of evidence. The only reason to ignore that evidence is politics.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>No evidence of gassing, huh? </p>

<p><a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177988">http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177988</a></p>

<p>First recorded evidence of gassing was by suffocation through car exhaust by putting a hose from the car into a room and that began with mentally handicapped victims. It wasn&#39;t fast enough.</p>

<p>Also you have this:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The use of gas chambers during the Holocaust was attested to by several sources including the Vrba-Wetzler report and testimony from Rudolf Höss, Commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, and other German soldiers.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><em>The Vrba-Wetzler report, Rudolf Vrba &amp; Alfred Wetzler,</em> 
<a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.net/othercamps/auschproto.html">http://www.holocaustresearchproject.net/othercamps/auschproto.html</a></p>

<p><em>Modern History Sourcebook: Rudolf Hoess, Commandant of Auschwitz: Testimony at Nuremberg, 1946</em> 
<a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1946hoess.html">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1946hoess.html</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Mass executions by gassing commenced during the summer 1941 and continued until fall 1944. I personally supervised executions at Auschwitz until the first of December 1943 and know by reason of my continued duties in the Inspectorate of Concentration Camps WVHA2 that these mass executions continued as stated above. All mass executions by gassing took place under the direct order, supervision and responsibility of RSHA. I received all orders for carrying out these mass executions directly from RSHA.&quot;</strong> -Rudolf Hoess</p>

<p><em>J.C Pressac (1989,). &quot;Testimony of SS private Boeck&quot;. Auschwitz: Technique and operation of the gas chambers (NY: Beate Klarsfeld Foundation,): 181</em>
<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/b/ftp.py?people/b/boeck.richard/boeck-testimony">http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/b/ftp.py?people/b/boeck.richard/boeck-testimony</a></p>

<p>So you even have the Nazi soldiers themselves saying that the gas chambers existed..</p>

<p>Oh look, even gas vans were used!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_van">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_van</a></p>

<p>And to attest to the &quot;reconstructed&quot; gas chambers:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The gas chambers were dismantled or destroyed when Soviet troops got close, except at Dachau, Sachsenhausen, and Majdanek. The gas chamber at Auschwitz I was reconstructed after the war as a memorial, but without a door in its doorway and without the wall that originally separated the gas chamber from a washroom. The door that had been added when the gas chamber was converted into an air raid shelter was left intact.&quot;</strong></p>
