    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>This is stupid, like really really stupid, in fact I cant tell if you&#39;re a troll or not, but i&#39;ll just assume you aren&#39;t and continue.</p>

<p>First: <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html</a></p>

<p>Notice at a mere 500c structural steel loses 80% of it&#39;s strength, the steel does not have to melt to cause a failure in the building.</p>

<p>Second jet engines are NOT made of steel, they are made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy">superalloys</a> which are specifically designed to have extreme high heat strength. Many super alloys retain 100% of their yield strength at 1000c, twice the temperature where our structural steel was reduced to the yield strength of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength">PLASTIC</a> (quite literally, look at 20% of structral steels yield strength, it matches perfectly with nylon/polyester)</p>

<p>Additionally, turbine blades now days typically have internal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade#Cooling">cooling passages</a> through which cooling air is passed in order to allow the engine to operate at higher temperatures than even super alloys are capable of unassisted.</p>

<p>TL:DR This is dumb, Steel loses enough strength to fail at low temperatures, No jet engines are not made of steel as the temperatures they run at would outright melt steel. </p>

<p>Nickel Alloys don&#39;t begin to weaken until they are almost to their melting temp. Steel weakens significantly before it gets to its melting temp. Yes, a jet engine made of steel would fail... that is why they are not.</p>

<p>There are better arguments to be made about 911 being fuckery then the argument OP is trying to make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your logic is pretty flawed. In the case of an engine we are talking about a smallish appropriately sized and controlled combustion of fuel, which is what the engine was designed to do. In the wtc.we are talking about structural steel, not designed for combustion with a very large uncontrolled blaze. Very different.  Essentially those steel girders acted like wicks for the jet fuel, they were coated which caused them to heat very quickly and weaken. They don&#39;t have to reach melting point, they just had to weaken sufficiently for the 1000s of tons they supported to be too much for them.</p>

<p>I hear a lot more from the argument that the fires didn&#39;t melt the steel but weakened it.  If this is true, then we might have other examples of steel frame buildings falling like this (the bad news is we don&#39;t have examples of other buildings who also got hit by a plane).</p>

<p>However, even if it was weakened and fell, we still have to contend with the fact there was indeed molten metals on the site.  Where did those come from in this case?  Seems we need some intense heat from that...something which office supplies and jet fuel just don&#39;t seem capable of?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a question, not being facetious: if the surface temperatures around these areas were in to the 1000s, how did search and rescue missions take place? I&#39;d think anyone nearby would have been incinerated.

<p>Also, to add to that, I would think the adjacent areas would have been much hotter than the pictures show. Those areas are relatively small to be as hot as the image claims, what about residual heat?</p>

<p>Yes.  In fact, I consider eyewitness testimony to be more than worthless. It&#39;s too unreliable to be evidence toward reality, but people tend to believe it readily and strongly.  That can make them distrust better, more reliable forms of evidence that disprove the incorrect eyewitness testimony.  </p>

<p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think eyewitness testimony should be used <em>by itself</em> to come to a conclusion.  But I think it can be useful, maybe to guide the line of questioning and find some solid evidence.  Especially if a lot of people are saying the same thing.

<p>It can certainly be useful to add some consensus to actual evidence.  However, eyewitness testimony in and of itself should not be considered evidence.  It should not even be used as a guide about where to look for real evidence, because it is just as likely (if not more so) to get you looking in the wrong direction than in the right one.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>especially</em> not evidence when it is what someone claims to have seen as they&#39;re running out of the fucking World Trade Center before it comes crashing on top of them.  </p>

<p>People trusting this type of false evidence is a major problem in the criminal justice system, and what leads to most false convictions.</p>

<p>This is categorically untrue. Compared to to the 20 hour inferno at the Hotel Windsor in Madrid, the WT fires were like brief flares.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4MjsVnasLA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4MjsVnasLA</a></p>

<p>Despite the very top of the Windsor tower crumbling, the integrity of the steel core was not affected. </p>

<p>And as for the planes affecting the structure of the towers, there is zero evidence for this. Those planes, (at circa 100-150 tonnes) represented 0.02% of the mass of either of the twin towers (at 500,000 tonnes).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At a little over 800 degrees steel reaches its critical temperature (The temperature at which it can no longer support a significant load) At this temperature it is at 60% strength. Jet fuel burns at 980 degrees. Structural steel at 980 degrees is at roughly 45% strength. Sure it is not hot enough to melt steel but it does not have to be. Also take into consideration that the steel was likely deformed from the massive impact weakening it further. I know I am basically talking to a brick wall here, but please consider what I said and look over this graph. <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html</a>
This information I have provided is not disinfo. It is not lies perpetrated by some conspiracy. These are facts that structural engineers have been using for decades. If you don&#39;t believe what I have just told you then you shouldn&#39;t trust any building or structural engineer because these are standards that everyone uses. </p>

<p>p.s. I am not denying a conspiracy here. There is a lot of fishy shit in the official story, but those planes could have feasibly taken down the towers. When you focus on things like this, you are only helping keep the important questions out of everyone&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>Commercial jet fuel is made of specially treated kerosene. It is given additives that protect it from ignition by unintended sources, such as static electricity, extreme cold and trace metals.</p>

<p>Flash Point
A compound&#39;s flash point is the temperature required for it to produce the vapors needed for ignition. Commercial jet fuel has a relatively high flash point of 100 degrees F, allowing for safe handling.</p>

<p>Auto-Ignition Temperature
After the jet fuel reaches its flash point, it must then be heated to its auto-ignition temperature, where it will automatically combust without the need of an outside ignition source. The auto-ignition temperature of jet fuel is 410 degrees F.</p>

<p>Not melt, but it would weaken the steel. Steel weakens under heat far below it&#39;s melting point.</p>

<p>This is wrong - the reduction in strength is logarithmic.  To be accurate, as the temperature rises exponentially, the strength would decrease linearly.</p>

Pieces of steel have also been found that were apparently melted and vaporized not solely because of the heat of fires, but also because of a corrosive contaminant that was somehow released in the conflagrations. And unexpectedly cracked washers in crucial connections in the towers are being closely scrutinized.</a></p>

<p>Not by itself no. With the the help of oxygen, iron, fire and the right circumstances you can get an eutectic reaction.</p>

<p>No, you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read it several times.  </p>

<p>Was there sufficient sulphur in the gypsum wall board to help cause such a reaction?</p>

<p>No one has ever once demonstrated even under controlled conditions that gypsum from wall board can magically form with other office materials to form a eutectic mixture.  In fact, the originator of this hypothesis, Dr. Greening, has since admitted that the hypothesis is not possible:<br/>
 &quot;I am prepared to admit that my initial proposal as to how steel was sulfided during the 911 events needs to be modified. Certainly it looks like diesel fuel, gypsum, concrete and aluminum alone are not going to do it .....&quot;
-Dr. Frank Greening</p>

<p>So really what we have in simplest terms is something that was added to the steel which made it melt, and at the same time there are no good hypotheses about how this could have come about from normal office materials.  So again, what is this mysterious corrosive substance?</p>

<p>So far we&#39;ve ruled out:
1.  Sulphur
2.  Normal office materials    </p>

<p>Well no neither hypothesis of gypsum or PVC has been conclusively proven or dis-proven but both hypothesis are rooted in real science ie: sulphur/chlorine can be part of an eutectic reaction.</p>

<p>The hypothesis is that normal materials found in an office can form a eutectic mixture.  This has never been demonstrated which means there is no evidence this can actually occur.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The eutectic reaction has still been proven through metallurgy regardless of what material caused it.</p>

<p>Yes, but your claim is that it came from ordinary office materials.  This claim is completely unsupported.  In other words you can&#39;t account for where the eutectic came from.</p>

<p>It can certainly be useful to add some consensus to actual evidence.  However, eyewitness testimony in and of itself should not be considered evidence.  It should not even be used as a guide about where to look for real evidence, because it is just as likely (if not more so) to get you looking in the wrong direction than in the right one.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>especially</em> not evidence when it is what someone claims to have seen as they&#39;re running out of the fucking World Trade Center before it comes crashing on top of them.  </p>

<p>People trusting this type of false evidence is a major problem in the criminal justice system, and what leads to most false convictions.</p>

<p>Now how dows 500 Celcius melt steel?!?</p>

<p>Not melt, but it would weaken the steel. Steel weakens under heat far below it&#39;s melting point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you realize that logarithmic is the inverse of exponential and this chart is inverted relative to what he is referring to right? </p>

<p>So yeah the decrease in strength occurs at an exponential rate relative to the increase in temp</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do blacksmiths bend metal without breaking it?</p>

<p>The answer to that question may literally blow your mind.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to add a video, watch how easy the heated iron/steel rod bends because it&#39;s heated, and notice how it bends where it&#39;s weakest, e.g. where it&#39;s been heated. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6YVz24iLVE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6YVz24iLVE</a></p>
