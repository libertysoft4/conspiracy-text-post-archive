When they asked if the town was known for satanism and someone responded &quot;yea I can believe that&quot; why didn&#39;t they then ask follow up questions like &quot;what do you mean? Why can you believe that? What have you seen/heard?&quot;. No attempt to talk to neighbors. They got the runaround from the bee and the police. </p>

<p>Yeah, I mean when I went to the projects I asked some shady looking hoods if this area was into guns and drugs, and they said &#39;yea I can believe that&#39;  So I kept pressing them for more specific info you know.. just to satisfy a troll on a message board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting blog. It seems like living in Newtown, CT today is like some kind of daily mindfuck. To continuously run tragedy through the frontal lobe of the brain sounds similar to some questionable experiments I&#39;ve read about... </p>

<p>The banners, the signs, the boarded up building, the constant barrage of legitimate and false media inquiries. At what point does it stop being a source of pride and comfort and become a demoralizing acceptance of victimization. </p>

<p>Does anyone remember anything like this with other school shootings? Did they board up and tear down the Theatre in Colorado?  Did they cover it with pictures and flags from around the world? Did the Amish allow this type of influence after the Nickel Mines shooting?</p>

<p>The fenced in, boarded up school reminded me of Chernobyl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how the media doesn&#39;t show Streakers on TV. At Sports games, the guys that strip and run across the field. Because it would create a Streaker Culture, an identity and fame that streakers everywhere could relate with and value. </p>

<p>Streaking is innocent and silly, yet it is not shown. 
Killing children is horrifying, and shown on a massive scale. </p>

<p>If the media did not cover these things would they happen? </p>

<p>No. This is the first time I have ever seen an overzealous police officer make overzealous statements. It&#39;s highly unusual. I am sure nothing like that has ever happened before.</p>

<p>EDIT2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later, I mentioned that I had read online where some people had suggested that Newtown might have a lively Satanic community. One of the two locals remarked, “I could believe that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT3: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Clark told me that there was a number of “conspiracy theories floating around” and “some of them even suggest that the shooting didn’t even happen.” Furthermore, “Snopes.com debunks many of these conspiracy theories.” I told Clark I was familiar with Snopes, but it was The Bee that reported that this was an off duty officer prancing about in the woods on the day of the shooting. Clark would not address this report and became very agitated with me “interrogating” him. “I don’t intend to discuss this any further with you,” he said. Mr. Clark then referred me to the Newtown Police for any additional questions. As I was walking out of the office I overheard a lady on the phone explaining to a caller that “there is an ongoing investigation,” and referring the caller to Snopes.com.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTF?! Why are professional law enforcement personnel referring inquiries to a debunking site with a known agenda? That&#39;s irregular, to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great little read... I suggest reading it... sounds like an interesting day out. There is an eerie quality about it - the way no one will talk about anything openly. Then there is the mention of Satanism, which I honestly never thought of (regarding this case at least) until I read it there... But then I found this (mainstream media reports that Adam Lanza worshipped Satan, according to a classmate): <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250608/Adam-Lanzas-classmate-reveals-Sandy-Hook-gunman-online-devil-worshiping-page.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250608/Adam-Lanzas-classmate-reveals-Sandy-Hook-gunman-online-devil-worshiping-page.html</a>
Amazing, right? I never knew this.</p>

<p>Now this one really starts smelling of MK Ultra. The fact that the Mother was also a very quiet person, that no one had seen Adam Lanza for three years... the rabbit hole just goes deeper and deeper...</p>

<p>And check this video out... wow... that&#39;s all I can say...

<p>Yeah, but it is a sufficiently unlikely scenario that it isn&#39;t worth spending a lot of time worrying about it, in my opinion.

<p>You are just as bad to bring these up.   I don&#39;t see anyone here suggesting this or certainly convinced of any of your examples without questioning (as you seem to be) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one in this particular article said those things, but that is surely the subtext. That some sinister plot had unfolded in Newton and that if we just pull the right strings, it will all become clear. There have been many many threads in this sub and around the net in general that suggest the very things that I referenced (well, maybe not mind control lasers, but drugs assuredly.) But you are right, I should have instead referenced the satanist/Freemason angle included in the blog post to be fair.</p>

<p>And you are the one who accused me of sheepledom, and even though you didn&#39;t use the term, I heard the dog whistle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting how the ones with questions are framed as delusional believers. that fact alone speaks volumes. Doing the Lord&#39;s work son.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What, exactly, were the questions being asked by this couple? Were they about firearm safety and how to address our calamitous mental health system? Or were they there to try to find out who was Concealing The Truth from the public (Masonic satanists perhaps.) They may be just asking questions, but they are leading, pointed questions that play to their biases about shadowy manipulators.</p>

<p>And man, I wish I had a nickle for every time someone trots out Operation Northwoods or uses the term &#39;False Flag&#39; like they are some sort of intelligence officer with all of the jargon readily at hand.</p>

<p>Yeah, especially when you prop up your own ridiculous explanations and shoot em down.  That&#39;s what shills do.</p>

<p>If the police, and the media were more up front and honest about things, perhaps we wouldn&#39;t have a nation full of people questioning what they hear on the news.
