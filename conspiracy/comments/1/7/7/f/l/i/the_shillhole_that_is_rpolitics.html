        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this belongs here, and I&#39;m sure the nature of reddit is already clearly obvious, but I was curious about it, so maybe some of you are too.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had multiple conversations with redditors about <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> being chock full of shills and plants in place to sway the opinions and mindsets of millions of people.  I&#39;ve been told that the overwhelming slant against anything republican/libertarian is just a result of the typical reddit user&#39;s political leaning.  I&#39;ve been laughed at for claiming that the sub is a gigantic front for the Democratic party, have been insulted for calling out users as obvious shills, and have even been called a shill myself for doing so.</p>

<p>During the election it became painfully obvious what I was looking at, as it did to many other redditors, so I decided to try something.  Over the course of a month or so, I starting tagging users whose posts made it to the front page.  This wasn&#39;t some constant vigil I kept, since I&#39;m hardly on reddit 24/7.  But everyday or two I&#39;d check in and continue tagging.  As I did, certain names started continually coming up.  wang-banger, anutensil, Whitefangs, Liberatea, Blue126, Corporate_ho, among many others.  tens and even hundreds of thousands in link karma, often accumulated within a couple months or so.  And consistently making it to the front page, day after day, with one agenda.  Elevate the left and demonize the right.</p>

<p>After a while I simply un-subbed.  I got sick of seeing the same shit day in and day out.  Sick of seeing the same shills posting their agenda and having their fellow shills quickly upvote them to the top, while immediately burying opposing posts to oblivion.  I didn&#39;t come back for a couple months, and when I did recently, I remembered my little experiment.  Or, not so much remembers, but saw it.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/H62OJ4z.jpg">Here is what my front page looked like at 1132 this morning.</a>  Each tag is for a user who made it to the front page during the few weeks I was watching the front page.  I was actually shocked to see so many familiar faces, as I suspected that the majority of the posters I tagged were only in action for the election and would fade away afterwards.  That is not remotely the case.  And lest you think it&#39;s just a case of good articles getting to the front page, and not an all out spamfest, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JfAZeRM.jpg">here are the New submissions as of 1135 today.</a>  The same thing happens day in and day out, as you can see by looking at the top posts <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Liyt1Xc.jpg">for the week</a>, or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Dd6pi8t.jpg">for the month</a>, or even <a href="http://i.imgur.com/twuM4cQ.jpg">for the year</a>.  Screenshots taken at 1140, 1144, and 1147 today respectively.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t care if those who read this are Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Rastafarians, or what-the-fuck-everians.  This is not about having a debate.  It is about reddit brainwashing so many people.  Yeah, we all know that many subs are echo-chamber circlejerks.  But <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is not <a href="/r/democrats">/r/democrats</a> or <a href="/r/progressive">/r/progressive</a>.  It is meant to encompass <em>all</em> political views and discussion.  Instead, it has become a machine to push a specific ideology, and that machine just so happens to come as a default sub.  As such, anyone new to the site is immediately inundated with posts demonizing republicans and libertarians, while at the same time praising the left and idolizing Obama.  And many of these new users come in the form of teens and even pre-teens who are still trying to find their voice.  What better way to mold these young minds than to present your ideology as the one your favorite website adheres to?  When you&#39;re surrounded by people all chanting the same thing, you tend to chant along with them.  And when all dissenting voices are drowned out with hate, ridicule, and downvotes, you have created the perfect propaganda machine.</p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone.  I thought I&#39;d post the screenshots anyway.  It&#39;s one thing to talk about it.  It&#39;s another to see it in action.</p>

<p>In all honesty though, you&#39;re right.  R/politics does, &quot;crank out drones who believe they think for themselves,&quot; but the real question at hand is whether or not this is the work of overly passionate liberals, or Federally employed agents.  While both might have the same affect on the masses, there&#39;s a huge difference between the two.  I&#39;m interested in the OP&#39;s opinion as well as others.</p>

<p>The larger a subreddit gets the easier it is to say this about any of them. The more circlejerking the easier it is to say this.</p>

<p>I would say a lot of subreddits &quot;crank out drones who believe they think for themselves&quot; like <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>, <a href="/r/anarchy">/r/anarchy</a> (the racism and sexism disguised as feminism subreddit), <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <a href="/r/conservatives">/r/conservatives</a>, <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a>, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you are not going to get &quot;top billing&quot;, it is not useless.  You can still post comments to the links to convey ideas.  All you need are a few strategically placed ideas that are picked up by people reading comments.  I&#39;m sure there are bloggers looking for ideas to repeat.  I&#39;ve seen several of my points picked up by Ben Swan and other bloggers.  I often see the same key phrases as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mods are a problem over there. Today I posted a link to the video where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XaTsFjjBpg">We Are Change gives $100 bills</a> out to people attending the Obama&#39;s inauguration who can get 3 out 5 questions about him correct.</p>

<p>I titled it:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We Are Change gives $100 to people attending the President&#39;s inauguration who can get 3 out 5 questions about him correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post is spam filtered and because of goldf1sh&#39;s brilliant moderationlong bot, I&#39;m notified. Why was I spam filted? Probably because the last video I posted there was this one:<br/>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/16t7xl/the_logic_of_still_supporting_obama/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/16t7xl/the_logic_of_still_supporting_obama/</a></p>

<p>It was insta-downvoted like every article, video or whatever which is critical of Obama. </p>

<p>Remember over Christmas break, we were all amazed that some articles critical of Obama had made it to the top of r/politics. That was because all the shills who guard the new queue were on holiday. If you post anything critical of Obama and I have on numerous occasions, it&#39;s insta-downvoted...and the only times I&#39;ve had success is if I leave his name out and any other &#39;trigger&#39; words.</p>

<p>So I write to the mods and ask them to approve it. They won&#39;t. They think the title needs changing. They want me to title it:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama Supporters Don&#39;t Know Obama: &quot;...we hosted a quiz show where we offered $100 to anyone who could correctly answer 3 out of 5 questions about the man they were there supporting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post would that title wouldn&#39;t last 1 minute, plus it&#39;s a spoiler.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, this has happened to me before. I submitted another video and it was removed (not spam filtered). I write and ask why. Editorialization I was told. Nope. I had to explain to them what &#39;editoriazed&#39; meant. It means inserting your opinion into titles. When you just describe what happens in a a video, it&#39;s not editorialization. They finally saw sense and approved it. So why are they so trigger happy when it comes to criticism of Obama? </p>

<p>Have you ever seen the amount of videos that don&#39;t exactly match the title of the actual video on youtube? They are numerous. All you have to do is search for the youtube domain on r/politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of the time they didn&#39;t want to let a Libertarian mod join the team. They said something like they didn&#39;t want to bias the sub...</p>

<p>Everyone should head to <a href="/r/politic">/r/politic</a> and try and build that sub up. It has loads of posts because it pulls them from everywhere but it needs comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some great points in here worth considering -- the ease with which a group could suppress certain posts and trend others on the rising page of a particular subreddit is actually a very compelling argument. </p>

<p>It would make a lot of sense political strategists would hire &quot;social media experts&quot; to influence Reddit. I suppose I just chalk it up to more of the power of the hivemind than a grand conspiracy to raise certain things to the front page and bury others. I do buy into the whole &quot;your average Redditor is Democratic&quot; thing because what I see at the top of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> very much reflects what I see on my facebook feed of other 20-somethings&#39; political views.</p>

<p>This is the more likely explanation of what it is.. Most of the people who actively visit <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> regularly are in the same demographic, so it makes sense that most of the top comments/threads are so similar.</p>

<p>My only proof is anecdotal, just try talking to random people at your work or people who go into your store/office about politics, and see what they have to say. Now imagine those people are Redditors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling people shills and dismissing their arguments with this ad hominem is not constructive, and typical of groups where dogma and conformity is valued more than than open discussion and new ideas.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy seems lately to shift into this direction. Questions are dismissed without thought, and there&#39;s shill hunts going on. Because the official r/conspiracy way of thinking has to be accepted without question. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what like minded people do, historically. Critics of religion were dismissed has heretics, critics (or perceived critics) of communism were dismissed as counterrevolutionaries, post 9/11 critics of american policy were dismissed as unpatriotic .. in each case dogma was more important than understanding the truth and constructive discussion.</p>

<p>So it is too with r/conspiracy. Shills are everywhere, because the dogma of 9/11 and now Sandy Hook, cannot be questioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d assume that reddit userbase is very liberal and atheist skewed. That&#39;s why liberal ideas get a lot of upvotes. </p>

<p>That one user does post incredibly lot. But don&#39;t you think it was a paid shill that they&#39;d spread that shit across several hundred accounts? Now it seems to be just a few karmawhores who&#39;re obsessed with reddit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not kidding, but some people are obsessed with this shit. Given opportunity, some people will go overboard. I know a guy who plays call of duty 12 to 14 hours every day, and he&#39;s not getting paid. </p>

<p>At least I&#39;d like some actual evidence before I believe there&#39;s a paid leftist mind op on reddit. Additionally it would make little sense since it would be preaching to the choir - considering that it&#39;s a liberal/leftist/atheist crowd anyways even if you discount the &#39;obvious shills&#39; you pointed out. </p>

However i have only been called a shill once or maybe twice despite the fact that my opinion is often contrary to the herd in here. I think its due partly to the fact that i will supply sorces if i can and my account is almost a year old (but I&#39;ve only started posting in rcinspiracy in the past month or so).  I don&#39;t like shill calling, i hate it you can look at my history and see where I&#39;ve railed against it many times, but if you make a good argument and your account is more than a month old, they seem to hold off... Just my personal anecdotal experience. I&#39;m sure many privately think i might be a shill, but most have yet to say it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/politics is just like r/lgbt in that only the most sanitized information is allowed to thrive there.  Every post is yanked directly from MSNBC, CNN or some other mainstream source.  It&#39;s hivemind to the 100000000000th degree.  They&#39;re no better than the Christian conservatards they denounce; they just represent a different side of the same coin.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re ruthless when it comes to debating their views and will quickly resort to name-calling and other childish tactics.  That&#39;s one thing I appreciate about this subreddit--most of us are capable of being civil even if we don&#39;t always agree.  </p>

<p>TL;DR--r/politics is a losing battle for critical thinkers.  Slowly but surely, more people will defect to this subreddit and other places like it, which is why we should focus on posting quality content <em>here</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. It seems more and more like Reddit is being abused to warp the minds of the next generation. </p>

<p>Reddit isn&#39;t making a profit, yet they are commercially supported. </p>

<p>Why? The answer must be that they are making up for it from funds from somewhere else. </p>

<p>The admin actively support certain subreddit, like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and turn a blind eye at leftist subreddit like SRS while they demonize right wing subreddit like <a href="/r/BronyHate">/r/BronyHate</a> for even the slightest of issues. </p>

<p>On that note, we at <a href="/r/BronyHate">/r/BronyHate</a> have been realizing how much emasculating influence is directed at white males, the same group persecuted by SRS, and coincidentally the target audience of Reddit. </p>

<p>What I see here is not a general brainwashing of the public (that&#39;s what lame stream media is for), but a systemic attack against an &quot;oppressive majority&quot; . </p>

<p>The reddit system needs to be replaced by some other web site.  It is to easily gamed.  There has to be a way to let the end user decide what bias she/he will follow so that votes don&#39;t matter unless someone &quot;follows&quot; your posts.  With the number of visits that reddit gets, I wonder if there is room to compete.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>This week alone I have had lunch with several different groups of people, all of them (without me steering the topic) talked about guns, their guns, and the larger clips / assault riffles they have and are getting.  These are people working in Corporate Companies not &quot;red necks&quot;.

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a group of ultra-loyal liberals, it&#39;s just a very large forum for political discussion for people of certain demographics, of which seems to trend towards liberalism (go figure with the youth of today!). </p>

<p>Obviously there are &#39;shills&#39; everywhere - <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> included so I don&#39;t see why you need to get your panties in a bunch over it. The problem is a lack of critical thinking - not a trend towards liberalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just my opinion, but as a former and lifelong republican (and I seem to be one of many here), the process of &quot;coming out&quot; politically is not only quite an awakening, but what I see is a slow revolt in america, to the degree that people aren&#39;t just rejecting the ideology of the fundamental christian conservatives that have taken the party over, but in a tsunami-like effect, some good ideals are getting washed away too by the wave.</p>

<p>The opinions here reflect the real world, unless you&#39;re in the bible belt.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think most of us have a problem with many of their beliefs, but people are no longer accepting these belief systems being forced upon them -- this is where the issue lies for me, and it would seem many others, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that there is a conservative and liberal rubreddit for all the expected circlejerking, but as I said, the republicans have lost their way:  Their constituency is shrinking, and trends like this are only amplified on a website this huge and this vocal, and this subreddit is just a reflection of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you ever stop to think about how much the right really sucks? The left shift is happening for a reason - people aren&#39;t buying the traditionalist viewpoint anymore. So how does the right wing political machine respond? By resorting to dishonest tactics, like gerrymandering, voting I.D. laws targeting minorities, the SuperPACs that poured corporate money into Republican coffers, etc. And the lying! Romney lying his ass off the entire campaign. Ryan getting caught in his words and getting shut down by Biden. The entire Fox and Friends propaganda machine. Rush Limbaugh, need I say more. The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Redditors, generally being more studious folk, will be quick to reject flawed ideology supported by false claims. This is why Reddit is left-biased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair. And its hard, i know. I see a lot of shill calling. However i have only been called a shill once or maybe twice despite the fact that my opinion is often contrary to the herd in here. I think its due partly to the fact that i will supply sorces if i can and my account is almost a year old (but I&#39;ve only started posting in rcinspiracy in the past month or so).  I don&#39;t like shill calling, i hate it you can look at my history and see where I&#39;ve railed against it many times, but if you make a good argument and your account is more than a month old, they seem to hold off... Just my personal anecdotal experience. I&#39;m sure many privately think i might be a shill, but most have yet to say it.</p>
