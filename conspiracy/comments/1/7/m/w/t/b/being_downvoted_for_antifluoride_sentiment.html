Private companies can always bottle fluoride water, you know? Let people choose? Boy did that opinion get down-voted. My favorite quote from those comments, or really least favorite, scariest:  </p>

<p>&quot;It increases the standard of living of the population (and in a very cheap and effective fashion). This is what the government exists to do.&quot;</p>

<p>See, these things are incredibly difficult for low-income individuals to maintain. I haven&#39;t been to a dentist in about four years, simply because I don&#39;t have insurance and can&#39;t afford to pay out of pocket. And the cost per effectiveness of fluoride supplements is much, much higher than the same ratio for fluoridation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that hard if you&#39;re serious about being healthy. You just don&#39;t get to gorge yourself at every meal.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been living paycheck to paycheck, negative bank balance to pay the rent, for my entire adult life. I haven&#39;t had a cavity in at least 10 years(non-fluoride toothpaste, and filtered water...yes, it took a long time to get the filter), <strong>and</strong> have managed to keep a trim figure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard, yes, but it&#39;s not <em>that</em> hard. It&#39;s about priorities. You can spend $100 on crap food and get a lot, or you can spend $100 on good food, and just eat a little bit less at meals. Maybe don&#39;t eat to the point of nausea, which is commonplace in the US. Drink tea or water instead of soda (soda is the most worthless of all foodstuffs, and a tall glass of water is excellent as a &quot;filler&quot; when you cant eat a meal right away). Eat rice instead of pasta, beans instead of frenchfries. Spend a little bit bigger chunk of your food budget on greens instead of hamburger helper fauxfood. </p>

<p>yep, portion control is everything. The hard part is breaking out of the cycle of overeating. I grew up on the classic &quot;farmers diet&quot; (meat and potatoes for every meal) and its taken a long time to get used to eating realistic meals instead for cramming 1500cals in my face per meal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, according to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/MMWr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm#tab2">this</a>, the upper tolerable limit for adults is 10 mg/day. The upper end of FDA-allowable fluoridation is 4ppm, or 4 mg/L (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/MMWr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm">source</a>). So you&#39;d have to drink 2.5L of fluoridated water at the maximum legal limit to hit your maximum tolerable intake for a day. Note, though, that according to my second link, the tolerable limit is &quot;a level highly unlikely to pose a risk for adverse effects in almost all persons.&quot; So even if you&#39;re maxing out on maxed-out water (while most of it is approx 1 mg/L, meaning you&#39;d need to drink 10L of water to hit the tolerable upper limit) the vast majority of people are not going to suffer adverse effects.</p>

<p>Edit: can those downvoting tell me why this is incorrect, or why they are downvoting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is you have to factor in multiple sources. My mom was a whack job when I was a kid, she had a mouthful of rotten teeth and was 100% CONVINCED that fluoride was the answer. She upped our intake every chance she got and the result? Fluorosis. My and my brother didn&#39;t know what it was till we got older, but we both had it. We both had symptoms, mine are more severe. I failed to grow properly and am quite short and ill proportioned. Our teeth are still fucked looking from it. If anything I think they ought to take it out of the water supply and just leave it in tooth pastes and mouthwash, it&#39;s all you really need. Anything more is overkill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t even in our water. We had well water. Well, I guess I can&#39;t conclusively say it wasn&#39;t in there. There could have been natural fluoride.  I guess my point is that there is still a lack of education on fluoride. I could see other whacked out moms doing their kids. Heck I saw bottled water marketed for kids that had added fluoride. Also since it is so easily available from other sources, I don&#39;t see the point. When my mom was a kid it was nowhere to be found other than rich folk who could afford it. So they added it to water... now? It&#39;s in everything. If you use toothpaste you get enough. If you don&#39;t use tooth paste and your teeth rot... what were you expecting anyways?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the question is how far overboard you have to go for serious fluorisis of the type you describe. From the evidence I&#39;ve seen, you really do basically have to be chugging fluoride mouthwash or eating toothpaste as a snack. The point is that, based on my sources above, the average fluoridation amount in mg/L terms is roughly 25% of the highest you can go without having any visible negative effects on the vast majority of the population. I doubt that anyone is increasing their fluoride <em>intake</em> (not exposure, since surface fluoride is not absorbed by the body and thus doesn&#39;t count towards the daily upper milit) by enough to cause the negative effects you describe, without some serious overkill. Just drinking fluoridated bottled water and using toothpaste isn&#39;t even going to cause significant dental fluorsis, much less the sort of systemic fluorosis you describe, without an <em>extraordinarly</em> weird person. Like, statistically-improbable-to-actually-exist weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoridation levels vary country to country. This in no way clears medicating peoples water en mass. Some people drink alot more water than others and don&#39;t have the convenience of a none fluoridated source. Thereby their is no way to determine dosage. And without testing each individual glass of water you couldn&#39;t possible know exactly how much fluoride is in the water. is it 1.5 ppm? 4? It could test at 20 ppm and we&#39;d never know! Again, no way to determine individual dosage. Then theirs the fact that we absorb fluoride via bathwater. So even if you don&#39;t drink it, by damnit you&#39;ll get it anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>See if they will let you make payments. It&#39;s like $200 for an exam and cleaning so if you can pay $20-$30 (assuming you have more income than a state insurance recipient) a month, you can pay it off in a reasonable fashion. You can also check out any local dental schools as they may do discounted work. Also, the cost for effectiveness isn&#39;t as black and white as it seems. When people end up with fluorosis to compensate for the few who can&#39;t find small <em>topical</em> doses, the scale swings the other way in terms of cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at hear. So fluoride is good for children and peoples teeth in general... So what?</p>

<p>What they don&#39;t usually tell us is the truth that fluoride is <em>toxic</em>, not just at certain levels, it is toxic. and really it has no place in any water supply other than by the freedom of the individual to decide weather or not they want to add a known toxic element to every inch of their being...</p>

<p>&quot;Knowledge regarding the reproductive and genotoxic effects of fluoride is limited. Available evidence does not support an association between fluoridated drinking water supplies and congenital malformations. Data on the genotoxic effects of fluoride in human populations are unavailable.&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry, that&#39;s 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg, not mg/L (AKA ppm). At normal rates (~1 mg/L) that child would have to ingest 1-3 liters of water &quot;in a single sitting&quot; to suffer toxic symptoms, at which point the 22lb-child (10kg) is probably suffering from a much more acute problem after three rapid liters of water ingestion: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication">water intoxication</a>.

<p>&quot;Low-level fluoridation, like low-level radiation, is a major pollutant which environmentalists should recognize as such. Like other pollutants, the harmful effects of both low-level fluoridation and low-level radiation have a history of denial which is associated with scientific, professional and academic misconduct. Tolerance levels for low-level fluoridation and low-level radiation are not based on scientific findings. Instead they are determined by special interest groups which have enough money to buy enough political clout to influence government and other high-level agencies.2 &quot;The wages of sin are death.&quot; But those who die from low-level fluoridation and low-level radiation are not the sinners, but their victims. &quot;</p>

<p>These are challenging issues and their is disinformation on both sides of the fence. </p>

<p>The long term adverse effects of fluoridated water at all levels is not something that has been studied enough if it all. And how is it that fluoride suddenly becomes not toxic at whatever the WHO sets as the toxic limit? If Fluoride causes skeletal fluorosis in higher doses is it reasonable to presume that it likely isn&#39;t good for us in constant small doses? You don&#39;t think their could possibly be an accumulative effect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve posted several long breakdowns of this paper recently. The gist of the reasons as to why it is invalid in this argument stem from the fact that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 27 studies in the meta analysis are almost uniformly Chinese.</p></li>
<li><p>The fluoride sources in the studies are all naturally occurring.</p></li>
<li><p>The levels of fluoride in the sourced water is several times higher than that of deliberately fluoridated water.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The meta analysis states that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The criteria for inclusion of studies included studies with high and reference fluoride exposures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference studies were of American children. Therefore, the Chinese children who were exposed to fluoride had a lower IQ than their American counterparts. This completely debunks the idea that fluoride is universally bad if ingested.</p>

<p>The paper presents the results of a meta-analysis a university in Shenyang did on 27 Chinese studies. Harvard only get a credit because the Chinese team needed information from their databases. This is why the paper is not hosted on Harvard&#39;s Health School&#39;s website.</p>

<p>The studies analyzed in the Chinese paper are <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ehp.1104912.s001.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the fluoridated water sources are naturally occurring, and that the fluoride content of the water they tested is far higher than that of deliberately fluoridated water.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kansas.com/2012/09/11/2485561/harvard-scientists-data-on-fluoride.html">The Harvard team that were cited have actually came forward and stated that the study is entirely invalid in judging whether or not trace water fluoridation is safe.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is a post of mine from some months back, while i was tracking it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>article describing the &quot;hush hush&quot; <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/08/new_coalition_lobbies_to_fluor.html">private lobbying collective</a> focusing intensely on portland&#39;s water.</p>

<p>here&#39;s <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/08/fluoride_group_secures_second.html">more</a>, mentioning a commercial campaign.</p>

<p>here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/08/fluoridate_portlands_water.html">scumbag editorial</a> from this paper demonstrating the framing of fluoridation absurdly as being either for or against the health of children.</p>

<p>from <a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/portlandcityhall/2011/09/fluoride_proponents_visit_comm.html">earlier this year</a>, the lobby first addressing Leonard, whom was first persuaded, with <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/08/fluoridation_plan_gains_politi.html">Fish</a>, and now Adams following.</p>

<p>this is the legitimacy-seeking <a href="http://www.upstreampublichealth.org/">public face</a> of the lobbying collective.</p>

<p>you can really see this thing take off from the lobbying collective&#39;s influx of lots of private dollars, to the use of the public health lobbying fence, to the private courtship of public officials with private dollars, one by one, until the majority vote was secured to fluoridate portland&#39;s water, a costly project and one that is historically unpopular in the city--three times it has been publicly voted down. well, they got us this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is intolerable. this council is an <strong>elected</strong> body that is making <strong>private</strong> decisions about <strong>public</strong> issues. </p>

<p>they&#39;re also allowing biometric security camera systems to be installed beginning downtown. a brand new hi tech training facility for militarized police is opening in deep northeast. awareness of the growing police issue here and its fascist relationship with the local business and financial population is of critical importance. nike is granted freedom from tax reporting for the state while police are given more money for helping banks foreclose on peoples houses. </p>

<p>fortunately, they&#39;re pissing off a lot of people who are creating strong neighborhoods with policies to come out and prevent any more foreclosures and talk about the questionable ethics of the council. </p>

<p>the fluoride vote in is may, and we need to make sure we tell as many portlanders as we can, because the commercial distribution of the opposition is mighty, indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I AM anti-fluoride. I haven&#39;t been in a fluoride thread in quite a while. But when I lay out the FACTS about it, I get down voted into oblivion, called a conspiracy freak, say need a psychologist  and so on. So I pretty much don&#39;t give a fuck about it anymore. Did pro-fluoride get to me? Maybe. I Have an artesian well so no worries there. I stopped using fluoride toothpaste ten years ago. Plaque no longer sticks to my teeth. My gums don&#39;t bleed anymore and my dentist asks me if I am using an electric toothbrush. I don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t disagree. : ) I just feel like the sources for info against fluoride - as with any true conspiracy, to be frank - get so muddled, so I feel like I&#39;m on the fence about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Who makes fluoride? Who has the biggest share of the fluoride market? I don&#39;t know the answer, but if there is a single company that dominates the market, they would most certainly have an active PR effort within social media sites to try to quell the spread of knowledge (aka &quot;paid shills&quot;). Especially because this topic has been gaining popularity for over 5 years now.</p>

<p>The fluoride issue is probably more about money at this point than anything else. Fluoridation is low on my list of interests/priorities so I haven&#39;t checked it out but I&#39;d imagine finding out who is selling the stuff to the water departments is the biggest piece of the puzzle, kind of surprises me I never hear anyone ask the question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fluoride issue seems to be about money but not making it, actually saving it. As an earlier post stated, I have also heard the fluoride used is an aluminum manufacturing byproduct that has strict disposal regulations. I think it comes down to the AMA and the ADA getting their funding from private business. When you can get the &quot;professionals&quot; to sign off on something, there is no pill for many that&#39;s too big to swallow. I can remember a story I was told when I was younger about a town I think was in Michigan that had a dentist that was struggling to stay in business because the town had an abundance of naturally occurring fluoride in their local water supply. As a kid I bought it hook, line and sinker. If fluoride will prevent me from getting the drill, sign me up! Needless to say, I&#39;m not sure I agree anymore. I am curious though if fluoride is found to occur naturally in the water in certain parts of the country.</p>

The CDC&#39;s website clearly states <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/fact_sheets/engineering/wfadditives.htm#2">that the majority of the fluoride used in water supplies is a byproduct of the phosphate industry.</a>  This shows it is more likely used as a cheap way to get rid of said byproducts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>anytime you write something that is anti-gov&#39;t , there are both gov&#39;t and non-gov&#39;t groups that will downvote, or mock you, bully, which may keep some from speaking against it, and/or actually gets them on their side...they&#39;ll call you a kook. loon, batshit conspiracy tinfoil hat wearing freak...  I notice it on several sites and forums, but recently learned about  Cass Sunstein, a Harvard professor hired by Obama... he&#39;s written 2 papers on Cognitive Infiltration , you can google it,...</p>

<p>basically what they do , is infiltrate groups/protesters/forums/chatrooms as one of the members in order to misinform/lie/mock/bully etc etc... he specifically worked on the 9/11 truthers, but it happens in many instances where a conspiracy theory may bring about negative attention towards gov&#39;t....obviously, not everyone defending fluoride, gov&#39;t is not a shill, but there are those who do this</p>

<p>so if you will, next time you notice a thread about fluoride, or gov&#39;t taking guns, etc..notice how there will be such adamant bunch that will laugh/insult/bully those that are against it..  I&#39;ve noticed it here on a subreddit.  I&#39;ve seen a few members that have over 400 threads and 90% or more are to mock a specific person that speaks out against gov&#39;t intentions...anyways, I&#39;m rambling, but good thread...  </p>

<p>regarding Fluoride, the latest Harvard Study from Chinese stats, stated that further studies needed to be done on low level fluoridation in the US..so why not remove it now, rather than have our kids be guinea pigs...  and there was a study on dead fetus that showed fluoride accumulation in the brain ...</p>

<p>plus, I could understand if we were told to swish fluoride around for 30 seconds or so....but to ingest it daily, to shower in it daily, to cook our foods in it, ..its in mostly every beverage..and I have no studies on this, but I wonder if fruits/vegetable watered w/FL water have it in side them as well, or is it filtered naturally somehow, dunno...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your comments, they&#39;re great. I 110% agree. I have spent tons of time on various forums besides Reddit, as well, and there are absolutely disinfo agents that easily persuade other to get on their side and gang up on people. There&#39;s actually a thread that proved this - <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread676733/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread676733/pg1</a> &lt;-- must read! they basically &quot;captured&quot; the bots! and then of course the thread got shut down. &gt;:)</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for that info, I&#39;m going to look that professor up!!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sometimes i think to myself &quot;God damn, these people must certainly deserve this terrible fate that they are making themselves.  Look how blindly they follow each other to their death and destruction.  brother after brother is chewed up and made to grease the cogs of the machine and still, though they saw it all firsthand, they clamor over one another to be the next victim.&quot;  Then I remember that the number one cause of this type of thinking is the poisoned state of mind they were brought up in and forcefully pushed into from birth by unknowing, well-meaning people and it&#39;;s my job to bring about an end to this chaos and take back the holiness that was once the great human race.  masters of a planet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at hear. So fluoride is good for children and peoples teeth in general... So what?</p>

<p>What they don&#39;t usually tell us is the truth that fluoride is <em>toxic</em>, not just at certain levels, it is toxic. and really it has no place in any water supply other than by the freedom of the individual to decide weather or not they want to add a known toxic element to every inch of their being...</p>

<p>&quot;Knowledge regarding the reproductive and genotoxic effects of fluoride is limited. Available evidence does not support an association between fluoridated drinking water supplies and congenital malformations. Data on the genotoxic effects of fluoride in human populations are unavailable.&quot;</p>

<p>From you second link under risks. In which all were down played. It&#39;s a scam, you know it, i know it.</p>
