<p>&quot;The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all hopes for peace in our time, in the U.S. or any other country. Make no mistake about it: we are at War now- with somebody- and we will stay at war with that strange and mysterious enemy for the rest of our lives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be a religious war, a sort of christian jihad,fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is going to be an expensive war, and victory is not guaranteed-for anyone, and certainly not for a baffled little creep like George W. Bush. All he knows is that his father started a war a long time ago, and that he, the goofy child- president, has been chosen by fate and the global oil industry to finish it off&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he meant that the powers that be who are the catalysts of the war see it as a religious war, but that the soldiers on the ground and the propaganda used to gain public support for it will involve religious and cultural differences. Think about how often we see how women are mistreated in Islamic culture compared to the way women are treated in our western culture, and how that fact can be used to justify aggression that has absolutely nothing to do with liberating Muslim women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, he could have meant that it was the catalyst. He&#39;s a much smarter man than I, and probably knew exactly what the root was. I just like to be clear. Too many people blame religion for war, but I don&#39;t think religion itself is the motivating factor. People use religion and so-called &quot;religious beliefs&quot; to mask, or justify, their intents (just as you pointed out). It&#39;s convenient to blame religion and use religion as justification, but I feel it&#39;s dangerous for us to easily be deceived by, and not uncover, the real core of war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that money and power can become a person&#39;s religion, but IMO true religion is love - anything that would detract from that may be a &quot;religion&quot; by our technical definition, but would never be true religion. Therefore, to me, &quot;religious war&quot; is an oxymoron. There is no such thing. The root of war would then be something far different, and it would be best for us to seek out and expose that root. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, for whatever your reason to go to war and willing to die for it, is equivalent to a man who believes in heaven, or a man who wants to defend his country or a man that wants honor for his family. Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the Christian who believes they&#39;re dying for Jesus is doing it solely for the promise of getting into heaven for eternity after they die. The Japanese, on the other hand, do not. They are aware that when they die, regardless of if it&#39;s for the emperor or not, they&#39;re dead. That&#39;s the difference I&#39;m referring to. They aren&#39;t promised anything after they die, and that isn&#39;t required in order for a country to support going to war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honor for their family isn&#39;t why they die for their emperor. Japanese people have an &quot;on,&quot; which is a debt that can never be fully repaid to the emperor. Death is a form of repayment. Familial honor is not the reason, nor is it &quot;their heaven.&quot; Now please do some research on the topic as I am tired of arguing this with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, many may believe in Heaven, but it doesn&#39;t mean that has to be their motive. Again, people may even SAY it&#39;s for religion, but rarely that is the core intent.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> - motive: &quot;ethnic competition&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars">American Indian Wars</a> - motive: Greed. (religion may have been used at times for justification, but it wasn&#39;t the motive)</li>
<li>Civil War - motive: Greed, slavery, freedoms, politics</li>
</ul>

<p>You know... I&#39;m not going to keep going. I&#39;d say there are far less conflicts that are motivated strictly by religion than other factors. I&#39;d say the #1 reigning factor in most conflicts is Money. #2 (especially historically) Endemic Warfare. It would be wise to weed out the rhetoric and focus on the causes.</p>

<p>I don really believe in any organised religion but the hostility against the money makers is quite clear throughout religions.</p>

<p>&quot;And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all of them who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.&quot;</p>

<p>This was the temple of Herod that was being used as a trade hub with essentially bankers swapping currency like what happens today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Roman Catholic Church has, as it likes to brag, been there from the beginning.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of The 700 Club?  How about Scientology?  How about Mormonism?  How about <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/26/joel-osteen-megachurches-business-osteen.html">Joel Osteen Christianity</a>?  How about Oral Roberts?  How about Garner Ted Armstrong?  How about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_new_religious_movements">any of these</a>?  These are all churches which are concerned with wealth for their &#39;founders&#39;.  Have you ever seen those gold statues on top of all the Mormon Temples?  Mormons are obligated to give their church 10% of their income.  Are you familiar with the way the Roman Catholic Church was able to seize and to hold on to all of Mussolini&#39;s money?  </p>

<p>Churches are, from day one, ALL ABOUT money.  That&#39;s the history of it.  You may, in your imagination, have a different version than the historical record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, you might wanna read that Joel Osteen article yourself. He didnt appear to be about money. And for you to group them all into one group with one label was quite ignorant because they do not all profess the same ideas nor are they all for money. The 700 Club seems pretty greedy too with their thousands (if not millions) of dollars in donations.</p>

<p>Also, the &quot;10% of harvest&quot; from the Bible was originally intended to be 10% of your harvest, as in crops, to be given to the church to give to the needy. Now it has become about 10% of whatever you make which God didn&#39;t intend. It&#39;s also a stereotype to think anyone who pays tithes is trying to get God to love them more. Granted, you have those people but it isn&#39;t many, many do it because they feel that the church needs money, which it does in this day and time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If god exists, the leadership on both sides beating drums of war are the worst of sinners.  They place their prophet idols and petty desires for power ahead of unity under god, ignoring the first and greatest commandment.  I hate theocrats because the state corrupts religion to the point where god is forgotten and replaced by men with delusions of grandeur.  I do believe in god and that most neo-cons will burn in the lowest rung of hell for eternity.  I like to envision a rung of hell with a human centipede for all the tele-evangalists, mullahs, fox news reporters, neo cons, and zionists that spent their lives dividing god&#39;s children for personal profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has always been the case. Religion was once a tool used to bring society together, to help form civilization and get people to work together. It didn&#39;t take long for it to become a tool of the rich, of the powerful, to keep the common man under their finger. It&#39;s just a truth of history. What powerful person follows their religion&#39;s ideology? None of them. They pretend to, until we catch them with their hand in the cookie jar. Yet these are the ones everyone admires, so how can we blame the average person for being fanatical religious, yet never follow their tenets? It&#39;s disgusting. No, not everyone is like that...but that&#39;s because we have evolved sociology, and we&#39;re becoming more aware. But not everyone is. It takes time. But things are bad and they need to improve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hunter S Thompson never trolled his readers. That&#39;s why I think your theory is ridiculous. He did shit, in his time, that bypassed authority and went straight to the heart of the average reader. He invented &quot;gonzo journalism&quot;.</p>

<p>The idea that he&#39;d bail out of the world and create a conspiracy &quot;just for the lulz&quot; goes against everything the man was (at least as far as I know him having read all his books).</p>

<p>The man was an outlier and much loved. He wouldn&#39;t throw all that away in an easily disproved suicide troll death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hunter wanted to send a message to the world that he was in control of his own life.  He wasn&#39;t a perfect man, or even a stable man.  Hunter was a guy who was incredibly paranoid and yet dulled that paranoia with copious amounts of intoxicant and fresh fruits and veggies.  He was an absolutely wonderful writer, and I&#39;ve read absolutely everything he&#39;s written that has been published.  I can read them again tomorrow and get something completely new.</p>

<p>The fact that Hunter always wanted to be in control of his life was his eventual downfall.  That&#39;s why he killed himself.  If I could pass a message along to Hunter right now, it would be &quot;Coward!&quot;.  I believe he would appreciate that sentiment.  I couldn&#39;t imagine a man so brave in changing the public image of his life to suit him could be so cowardly after watching a terrorist attack (fake or not).  No one even halfway competent would feel that the best thing they could do is take out an aging beat writer because he supposedly had material or evidence that the truthers claim they have every day.  Hunter had a house full of guns and one on him at all times.  The chances of being killed by a professional assassin is almost zero.  </p>

<p>Poor Hunter.  I miss him terribly.  I miss reading everything new he created.  I miss his reckless abandon in changing the details of a story to make things more interesting or mysterious.  I miss the nicknames he had for his vehicles.  I miss his fire and his rage and his passion.</p>

<p>I miss Hunter Thompson and the world misses him.  What a terrible waste.  The world needs him more than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two years ago in January 2003, Thompson actually did give an interview on KDNK radio (Colorado) where he made a suggestion that he may be murdered to shut him up.
&quot;Bush is really the evil one here and it is more than just him. We are the Nazis in this game and I don&#39;t like it. I am embarrassed and I am pissed off. I mean to say something. I think a lot of people in this country agree with me...we&#39;ll see what happens to me if I get my head cut off next week -- it is always unknown or bushy-haired strangers who commit suicide right afterwards with no witnesses,&quot; the writer said.</p>

<p>More confusion has arisen after a quote from one of the police officers investigating the death scene. Deputy Ron Ryan said there was a spent shell casing, but there was no cartridge in the firing chamber, as there should have been under normal circumstances. Sheriff&#39;s officer DiSalvo confirmed this opinion; &quot;I think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber&quot;. This &quot;single bullet&quot; problem has led to speculation that Thompson was coerced into self-inflicting a gunshot wound, being given a gun with a single shot, perhaps accompanied by threats against his family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been a while since I have pursued this information, but I remember the Jeff Gannon link being very intriguing.  Gannon was that gay prostitute who was somehow in the White House from time to time....often tossing softballs at George W during press conferences (even though he was running an active stud-whore website and had no real credentials).</p>

<p>Gannon might be one of the kids from the Franklin Scandal named Johnny Gosch (Jeff Gannon/Johnny Gosch).....Gosch&#39;s own mother believes that Gannon and Gosch are the same person.</p>

<p>Supposedly, there is a story of Larry King (not the TV host) taking Gosch to Bohemian Grove where the most disturbing sexual torture you have ever heard of went on.  The story goes that King stopped the plane before The Grove to pick up some people.  Gosch remembers a photographer named Hunter Thompson getting on the plane and being present (photographing) during the torture.</p>

<p>I have NO IDEA how much of this is true, but the rabbit hole is there if you watch that Conspiracy of Silence video and check out the Gannon/Guckert/Gosch link.  Enough IS provable to make this a HUGE conspiracy (dictionary definition of the word).....the only question is how far it goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misremembered the Bohemian Grove/Johnny Gosh part. Paul Bonacci was the boy who was taken to the grove and who reported the making of a snuff film at the Bohemian Grove. Bonacci later also identified Johnny Gosh and said that Johnny had been kidnapped for the pedophile ring.</p>

<p>Most allegations against Thompson came from Rusty Nelson. Nelson is a photographer who was involved in the Franklin scandal. His allegation against Thompson can be heard here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=K_4wyBGVxug#t=450s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=K_4wyBGVxug#t=450s</a></p>

<p>Paul Bonacci, one of the abused teenagers in the Franklin scandal, has testified to have been introduced to a man, who has called himself Hunter Thompson. Even if his story is true, the man could also have used a pseudonym. This is at least the believe of Nick Bryant. Bryant has written a book about the Franklin scandal. Here a <a href="http://www.franklinscandal.com/">link</a> to his website. Nick Bryant also finds Nelson not credible. I share his opinion.</p>

<p>Here is a video in which Paul Bonacci is interviewed by Gary Caradori the chief investigator of the Franklin subcommittee. Bonacci tells the story about the Bohemian grove and the snuff film.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.franklinscandal.com/Bonacci/">http://www.franklinscandal.com/Bonacci/</a></p>

<p>Since the Bonacci interview is a bit difficult to listen to, here is a shorter, quite dramatic version given by his attorney, the former Nebraska States Senator DeCamp. DeCamp reads a part of Bonacci&#39;s diary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=sEz3t71WKvU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=sEz3t71WKvU</a></p>

<p>During this investigation Gary Caradori died in a mysterious plane crash. His death meant effectively the end of the Franklin investigation. Afterwards witnesses were to afraid to come forward. But some interviews of abused victims can be accessed here:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/GaryCaradoriInterviewsOfFranklinScandalVictims">http://archive.org/details/GaryCaradoriInterviewsOfFranklinScandalVictims</a></p>

<p>Nick Bryant has studied sealed court documents and has found flight records which proved that children have been flown in private planes to Washington DC. Bryant has also tracked down and interviewed about 60 witnesses who were abused during their childhood and who were part of Larry King&#39;s pedophile ring.</p>

<p>This year Nick Bryant plans to bring out a documentary about the pedophile ring of Nebraska and the kidnapping of Johnny Gosh. The trailer can be seen here:</p>

The aspects that you could prove and that were covered in press are numerous enough to leave little doubt in my mind.....but the Hunter stuff was just hearsay, interesting food for thought, but not provable to me.  I am going to check out Drunkenshrew&#39;s info above and look further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction with Hunter. If you take everything he said as fact, then this is a truly scary world. But I believe most all of it. He often saw things and spoke about them long before anyone realized the truth he had uncovered. And the access he had to Washington insiders! His reputation worked for and against him, no one seemed to be too worried about him being a witness to bad stuff, because the public never knew what to believe from him. Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail was pretty revealing. </p>

<p>No one will ever know if he committed suicide or was assassinated. Plenty of people would want him dead, especially if he was writing what he said he was. I wonder where his notes went. But he and his family always knew that was a risk of the life he lead. If they did get into the Owl Farm and kill him and get back out without either being seen or getting shot by any one of the multitude of guns around that place, whoever they were must have been pretty impressive.</p>

<p>&quot;Thompson&#39;s son (Juan), daughter-in-law (Jennifer) and grandson (Will) were visiting for the weekend at the time of his suicide. Will and Jennifer were in the adjacent room when they heard the gunshot. Mistaking the shot for the sound of a book falling, they continued with their activities for a few minutes before checking on him.&quot;</p>

So they would have had to have a recently fired second gun of the same make with no silencer to get the balistics correct. Then they would need to get into the house after shooting him arrange the body in a suicide position including prints on the weapon, and get out again without being seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More confusion has arisen after a quote from one of the police officers investigating the death scene. Deputy Ron Ryan said there was a spent shell casing, but there was no cartridge in the firing chamber, as there should have been under normal circumstances. Sheriff&#39;s officer DiSalvo confirmed this opinion; &quot;I think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber&quot;. This &quot;single bullet&quot; problem has led to speculation that Thompson was coerced into self-inflicting a gunshot wound, being given a gun with a single shot, perhaps accompanied by threats against his family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He constantly talked about killing himself.  His family knew it wasn&#39;t a matter of if, it was a matter of when.  He wanted to die on top, die at the best point in his life.  When he killed himself, he was at home with his wife and son.  His son was in the next room, and heard the gunshot.  He then walked into the room to find his Dad dead.  No one in the family suspects anything.  No friends suspect anything.  He left a note that sounds like he wrote it.  No one was surprised. </p>

<p>His ex-wife claims he was incredibly depressed, and that led to his suicide, not his desire to &#39;die on top&#39;.  I think it was a combination of the two. Life was going downhill, he had already waited to long.  It was time to get out.</p>

<p>He lost his will to live once GWB was elected a second time, not 9/11.  That is when it became a matter of when.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I love and admire Hunter for his writing and for just being the man he was, I suspect living with him would have been a frustrating and sometimes terrifying existence. He was gun obsessed and threatened the life of friends, family and strangers alike.</p>

<p>His outlook on America post 9/11 was shared by Bill Cooper, who called 9/11 a week or two before it happened. He ended up dead too. I don&#39;t believe Hunter was &quot;suicided&quot; although he may have been driven to it by the CIA since he was already pretty unstable. All they would have had to do was play on his paranoia, leading him to believe they were closing in on him.</p>

<p>But then, who knows? We&#39;ll never know so all we can do is speculate. Some people just can&#39;t accept that sometimes the story is what it is. The man took out a gun and blew gis brains out.</p>

<p>RIP Hunter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are the sources for these allegations. Mark Dice didn&#39;t make this up:</p>

<p>Most allegations against Thompson came from the photographer Rusty Nelson. Nelson was involved in the Franklin scandal. His allegation against Thompson can be heard here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=K_4wyBGVxug#t=450s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=K_4wyBGVxug#t=450s</a></p>

<p>Paul Bonacci, one of the abused teenagers in the Franklin scandal, has testified to have been introduced to a man, who has called himself Hunter Thompson. Even if his story is true, the man could also have used a pseudonym. This is at least the believe of Nick Bryant. Bryant has written a book about the Franklin scandal. Here a <a href="http://www.franklinscandal.com/">link</a> to his website. Nick Bryant also finds Nelson not credible. I share his opinion.</p>

<p>Here is a video in which Paul Bonacci is interviewed by Gary Caradori the chief investigator of the Franklin subcommittee. Bonacci tells the story about the Bohemian grove and the snuff film.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.franklinscandal.com/Bonacci/">http://www.franklinscandal.com/Bonacci/</a></p>

<p>During this investigation Gary Caradori died in a mysterious plane crash. His death meant effectively the end of the Franklin investigation. Afterwards witnesses were to afraid to come forward. Further interviews of abused victims can be accessed here:</p>

<p>Since the Bonacci interview is a bit difficult to listen to, here is a shorter, quite dramatic version given by his attorney, the former Nebraska States Senator DeCamp. DeCamp reads a part of Bonacci&#39;s diary.</p>

<p>This year Nick Bryant plans to bring out a documentary about the pedophile ring of Nebraska and the kidnapping of Johnny Gosh. The trailer can be seen here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except, the Jews were never thrown out of Egypt. That&#39;s a biblical myth that somehow got accepted as historical truth, when recent studies have shown that there are no Jewish artifacts anywhere in Egypt, or on the supposed path of exile. The pyramids weren&#39;t even built by slaves, they were built by Egyptian contractors as ruins of settlements around the Pyramids have shown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From wikipedia:</p>

<p>&quot;The consensus among biblical scholars today is that there was never any exodus of the proportions described in the Bible,[15] and that the story is best seen as theology, a story illustrating how the god of Israel acted to save and strengthen his chosen people, and not as history.[13] Nevertheless, the discussion of the historical reality of the exodus has a long history, and continues to attract attention.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a hard thing to google, you&#39;ll find more and better sources. The problem being that people have already accepted something from a book without evidence, when there wasn&#39;t any to begin with.</p>

<p>Evidence for the Exodus from Egypt is plentiful---as long as one has their Biblical chronology right, and thus knows to examine Egypt&#39;s history around 2450 B.C., rather than around the traditional 1450 B.C.

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You and other scholars point out that there isn&#39;t evidence outside the Bible, in historic documents and the archeological record, for a mass migration from Egypt involving hundreds of thousands of people. But it may be plausible that there was a much smaller exodus, an exodus of people originally from the land of Canaan who were returning to it. Is that right?</p>

<p>Yes. Despite all the ways in which the exodus narratives in the Bible seem to be non-historic, something about the overall pattern can, in fact, be related to what we know from historical sources was going on at the end of the Late Bronze Age [circa 1200 B.C.E.], around when the Bible&#39;s chronology places the story of departure from Egypt.</p>

<p>Now, what is the evidence? ... [ discussion continues]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>*** google page 2 :  ****</p>

<p>Generally bible quotes, but also :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the discovery of the Merneptah stele scholars placed the date of the exodus and entry into Canaan much later. They are now forced to admit that Israel was already in Canaan at the time of Merneptah. Israel was big and strong enough to challenge Egypt in battle. This stele puts a terminus ante quem date of 1210 BC for the exodus (McCarter 1992, 132). </p>

<p>:</p>

<p>It also seems most likely that the Exodus from Egypt should be equated with the expulsion of the Hyksos. Not all the Hyksos were Israelites. It says in Exodus that a great mixed multitude came out of Egypt with Moses (Exodus 12:38).</p>

<p>:</p>

<p>This exit from Egypt by the Hyksos probably included the Israelites as well. The story of the Exodus is most likely bases on the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt, for there is no other record of any mass exit from Egypt (Robertson 1990, 36; Halpern 1994, 89-96; Redford 1897, 150). The evidence seems to fit well with Josephus&#39; account. Although the Egyptians saw the expulsion of the Hyksos as a great military victory, the Israelites viewed this as a great salvation victory for them.</p>

<p>which presents a range of interpretations, with some bullshit (&quot;very little Egyptian influence is discernible in biblical literature&quot; - are you fucking joking ? the core of the Torah philosopy and rule system is a copy of the horus theology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*** google page three ***</p>

<p>much the same, while the 3 or 4 pages here that seriously address the matter offer guarded acceptance,  a real &quot;Exodus is stupid&quot; is at <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_for_the_Exodus">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_for_the_Exodus</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In summary, while the bible is crazed make-believe, and I wouldn&#39;t believe an israeli that said &quot;X million&quot; (where X = 2.5) last week, let alone 3,200 to 3,400 years ago, there is nothing like a &quot;consensus among biblical scholars today is that there was never any exodus of the proportions described in the Bible&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correction. &quot;It will be a religious war, a sort of Zionist jewhad, fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy.&quot; Make no mistake the entire &quot;War On Terror&quot; is planning of Jewish Zionist minds for their international Bankster brethren&#39;s benefit. Mostly Christian oriented soldiers will be on the front lines and the Jewish Zionist media will write about it and promote it. War is the Banksters Harvest. This is a perpetual war for international Zionist banking. It is about destroying Islamic banking and bringing Muslim cultures under the control of Zionist cultural Marxists. Those that don&#39;t cooperate will be murdered by the Zionist controlled Military Industrial Complex.</p>
