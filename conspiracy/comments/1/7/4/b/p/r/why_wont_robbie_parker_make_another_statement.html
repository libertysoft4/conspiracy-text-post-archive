<p>Why should he?... I do not know why he chose to speak to the media, why he exposed himself to the unflinching gaze of the camera... But...</p>

<p>I also do not have any context other than that snap-shot of a few seconds with which to judge the &#39;sincerity&#39; of his pain and grief. </p>

<p>To generalise from this &#39;snap-shot&#39;&#39; to dismiss with absolute certainty the effects of grief, pain and the icy numbness of the loss of a child, speaks more about our humanity, our values and our character, than his &#39;legitimacy&#39; as a parent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only ever seen somebody laugh like that shortly after the death of a family member or close friend if they were reminiscing about something funny or crazy. However, this has always been when talking a out an adult who has had a long enough life that the pain and grief can be tempered by laughter. As a parent, I can tell you there is nothing to laugh about when your child is murdered. They haven&#39;t been on this planet long enough to have earned those kinds of stories. The death of a child is too raw. </p>

<p>Also, why the fuck does he start hyperventilating to get some tears going? That right there is some straight up method actor exercise going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But a shooter gunning down children in Sandy Hook is also a gut feeling, stemming from the same lack of evidence. This is what&#39;s most fustrating for me, that one conspiracy theory is acceptable and one isn&#39;t, simply because of what side the obviously corrupt media and government come down on. </p>

<p>Do you STILL believe everything they tell you without evidence? Even when they tell you that your own eyes lie? There&#39;s no footage of Lanza in the school despite an expensive camera system on property. There&#39;s no footage of Lanza at ALL, save ONE file photo they show repeatedly. There was no televised evacuation of 600 children, even though it allegedly happened while there were any number of news helicopters flying over head. There&#39;s one file photo of one adult with a handful of kids in a line. Nothing else. That might wash with you, but this isn&#39;t my first media circus, it <em>stinks</em> to me. </p>

<p>My point is, there&#39;s no hard evidence to support ANY story here. All we the public really have is what we can see, which is delivered by the admittedly corrupt media. </p>

<p>So again I ask you, are you really going to sit there and tell me that your theory is right and my theory is wrong because the media and the government, known liars, are on YOUR side? That&#39;s the only proof you have, and you expect me to honor it. </p>

<p>I refuse. </p>

<p>Asking questions IS having an agenda. I want to know the truth and it&#39;s not being discovered, AND draconian legislation is being pushed based on this lack of truth. Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Columbine footage was not officially released.</p>

<p><strong>Also incorrect. There&#39;s another thread in the sub from yesterday discussing this at length.</strong></p>

<p>You should read the thread. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/173fyz/sandy_hook_hoax_proof_that_media_helicopter_was/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/173fyz/sandy_hook_hoax_proof_that_media_helicopter_was/</a></p>

<p>If you wanted to know the truth you would stop clinging onto questions that have already been debunked over and over. Asking questions is fine but continuing to claim foul after being shown incorrect means you just don&#39;t like the answer and never will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about your claim we aren&#39;t entitled to footage? If the media had it the media would have released it, just like they showed the images from Columbine repeatedly. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t doing that with Sandy Hook. It&#39;s intriguing, to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, if the media had the footage I bet they would release it. </p>

<p>But the police have the security footage, which is why I doubt it would ever be officially released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if there&#39;s security footage the police would take it as they always do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not basing anything on whether or not security footage gets leaked. I don&#39;t have any expectations of ever seeing any either, so really the lack of security footage seems to be only your concern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think a press pass is going to secure security footage owned by a public school that is currently in an ongoing police investigation.</p>

<p>Remember, the Columbine pictures and videos were leaked, not released and the police were in shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Families of some victims are outraged, and said that the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office has failed to keep a promise that the photos would never leave that office. </p>

<p>&quot;People don&#39;t want the pictures of their dead kids circulating on the Internet, which it appears likely is what&#39;s going to happen,&quot; said Brian Rohrbough, whose son Dan was one of the 13 killed when shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold rampaged through the school on April 20, 1999. </p>

<p>The Rocky Mountain News has copies of a number of the photos, as do some Columbine families. </p>

<p>County officials were stunned Monday upon learning of the leak. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh my God,&quot; said Assistant County Attorney Lily Oeffler.</p>

<p>Why guess? If these people are actors, if they are not <em>actually</em> the parents of dead children and not actually the people they say they are, <em>this would be incredibly easy to prove</em>.</p>

<p>That no one has done it despite having over a month to do so is rather telling.</p>

<p>If people <em>really</em> believed Robbie Parker was an actor, if they really believed it and really believed revealing that truth would blow open a gigantic, disgusting conspiracy and prevent more of their freedoms from being taken away, they could do nothing more complicated than go knock on his neighbor&#39;s door.</p>

<p>This could have been done on any of the 60+ days since the shooting.</p>

<p>You know why this hasn&#39;t happened, or if someone <em>did</em> do it you haven&#39;t heard about it, don&#39;t you?</p>
