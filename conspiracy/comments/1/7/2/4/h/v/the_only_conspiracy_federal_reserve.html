<p>Second, subdue the world into using it as a reserve currency.</p>

<p>Now, you can own nearly anything.
You can control many by &quot;employing&quot; them.
You flood culture with propaganda telling them to worship your currency.
You flood intellectual circles with divisive nonsense.
Create secret societies that offer nothing but confusing symbology wrapped up as ancient secrets.
Anything that distracts people away from thinking about the scam is a plus.
Never mention it, never teach it, disallow the alternatives from being discussed.
When your charter is about to be renewed, create a mass hysteria around an irrelevant issue: end of the world, anyone?
Make the prime objective of government to ensure your status.
Require taxes be paid in your currency.
Now you win.
What is missing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is missing: never attribute to malice what can adequately be attributed to stupidity.  There are people who genuinely don&#39;t want to hear about how badly they&#39;re being boned, and to my mind that&#39;s the essence of good conspiracy: willing participants.  The sorts of people who would write off everything you said by saying &quot;you&#39;re full of shit,&quot; is what makes this possible.</p>

<p>Rather sadly, you can&#39;t MAKE people care about anything.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about currency, you need look no further than the ultimate fate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Dollar">Liberty Dollars</a> to understand that the people in charge of our currency really DO grasp the threat any alternative poses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before organised criminal groups were busted and the evidence was finally brought to light, the mainstream was scandalized at the thought that it could even exist. People actually believed that criminals were nothing more than purse snatchers and stick up artists. When the public found out that criminals could be sophisticated, completely hide their tracks, commit massive crimes and get away with it, this revelation shook people down to their core. </p>

<p>The political/economic arena is just the next logical step where you are going to find organised crime, I can guarantee you with total certainty that criminal  conspiracies are rife within all branches of government, banking, business. There is no way for those sectors to insulate themselves from the influence of outright criminal elements. It is logically impossible for there not to be conspiracies. There are big questions, like is there really a world conspiracy? - I guess the answer is sometimes. But to suggest that it&#39;s all down to stupidity, is so incredibly naive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the way he said it, but I have to agree that I&#39;d rather have a currency backed by a finite resource.  As soon as the curtain is finally lifted, and knowledge of the brain-slug banking cartel reaches critical mass, would currency not inevitably fall back to being backed by gold, or something with demonstrable scarcity?  I personally wouldn&#39;t trust any party with the task of responsibly operating the printing press, not after what we&#39;ve seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>do you subscribe to the notion that their wealth may not be directly attributed to their names but in trusts and NGO&#39;s and Policy Institutes which they sit on the boards? they can still live the lavish lifestyle to which their accustomed to and have the added benefit of claiming they are no longer wealthy and powerful and there fore, shouldnt be scrutinized. ? im not saying anything but &quot;this wouldnt surprise me&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They wouldn&#39;t get scrutinized by anyone outside of the fringe even if they were as wealthy as before so I don&#39;t see that actually being a concern.</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s nearly impossible to hide as much wealth as is attributed to them and the management/storage of it would involve a lot of people and be difficult to compartmentalize properly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible they have tens of billions hidden away, there are a few recent and current world leaders suspected of hiding such fortunes earned while in power.  But even in the case of someone like Putin the details came out.  Once you get into the hundreds it becomes very tricky to allocate it in a way to keep ahead of inflation and hide it and trillions I&#39;d say impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow downvotes everywhere, im a bit peeved finding out that this sub is so full of assholes. Its unfortunate, but whatever. Thanks for your answer. I think the moto of this sub should be Aristotle&#39;s &quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot; but damn, these people here are so fucking judgmental and hostile! That being said, Id disagree with you. I dont think you get to the point where your 5 sons own and operate the central banks of europe and somehow dissipate that wealth away over the course of generations. With compounding interest being what it is, and the families holdings in just about every industry there is... i think its obvious that they still <del>control</del> possess unimaginable wealth and control over the worlds economy. But its something im not willing to take the time to independently verify, as i dont find it to be particularly important. im more focused on publicizing alternative methods of money creation and banking. They can have their games, we shall create new systems and they shall be for the benefit of all and not for the select elite few. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice try but I&#39;m being pretty precise in my use of it here. The specific tales of shady bankers concocting the Fed on a secret island is recycled anti-ZOG propaganda, and it&#39;s not a coincidence many of those bankers of old were Jewish. I&#39;m not about to call pro-Palestinians (of which I am one) anti-Semites, then you might have a legitimate claim. Just because the label of Anti-Semitism is overused doesn&#39;t mean the appropriate response is to deny that Anti-Semitism has ever happened or has any legacy effects in the present.</p>

His father Lord Rothschild is worth around half that(Going off his holdings in RIT, and assuming other smaller investments/properties).

The surplus was loaned to the rest of the federal government, at interest. This has been controversial for several reasons, including the fact that the payroll tax falls much more heavily on the lower and middle class than an income tax (to otherwise fund the government) would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One issue that I don&#39;t have a full understanding of is that I thought the gold standard was weakened by Roosevelt and then eliiminated during the Nixon administration. Prior to that, gold bullion was seen publicly in Ft. Knox in 1953 and again in 1974 after congressional demand. What became of the gold bullion subsequently? My societally retarded &quot;logical&quot; mind would say it must still be there. Talk of numerous audits, though, got me to thinking why it is almost 40 years now since we&#39;ve publicly seen anything. What is the correlation between that gold and the fed. And assuming the gold is still there, what purpose does it serve?</p>

<p>Since its inception in 1913 the Federal Reserve System has been subjected to a variety of financial and performance audits by Congress, the executive branch, and private accounting firms, although responsibility for this task has shifted from time to time. From 1913 to 1921 the Board of Governors, then known as the Federal Reserve Board which sets monetary policy and regulates the activities of the Federal Reserve Banks, was audited annually by the U.S. Treasury Department. In 1921 Congress created the Government Accounting Office (GAO) and assigned it to audit the Board until 1933. In the Banking Act of 1933, Congress voted specifically to remove the Board from the GAO’s jurisdiction. From 1933 to 1952 audit teams from the twelve Federal Reserve Banks performed the annual examination of the BOG’s books. From 1952 to 1978, the Board, under authorization from Congress, decided to employ nationally recognize accounting firms to conduct the audits of itself to insure independent oversight. This provided an external evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the examination procedures.1</p>

<p>In 1978 Congress passed the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act (31 USCA §714). It placed the Federal Reserve System back under the auditing authority of the GAO. The Act significantly increased the access of the GAO to the Federal Reserve Banks, the Board, and the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). Since then, the GAO has conducted over 100 financial audits and performance audits of the three Federal Reserve bodies.3 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s basically what I&#39;ve heard too.  About that anyway.  There obviously has to be some running capital into the next year too.  So maybe 80-90% to the treasury (the problem here being that the treasury then gives it to the banks rather than use it to reduce taxes invest in services etc) </p>

<p>But  basically it is the American people who are making money out of thin air and using this magic money to protect Americans interests in the world.  </p>

<p>I am certain this is not completely right but I am also certain that goldbugs are trying to crash the dollar in just the same way any other speculator would.  And I am always wondering if Americas ability to make money out of thin air being removed will mean that the rest of the world will no longer be paying what amounts too a large part of Americans taxes for them.  That the Americans will have to pay them all themselves if the petro-dollar goes.  That goldbugs will see the value of gold double.  But then will see their taxes go up eightfold. </p>

<p>Yeah they have that plus operating costs, but I&#39;m pretty sure those never run higher than 3-5%.</p>

<p>I think more importantly Americans use the money to counteract the business cycle and try to curb the effects of recessions. In particular, to stop the currency from becoming deflationary and entering a spiral where both consumption and investment slow down and hinder each other. Most goldbugs seem to think deflation = more purchasing power, forgetting that it affects not only the value of commodities but also that of their own labor, as well as the value of their debts. That&#39;s without even speaking of the economic effects of &quot;under your bed&quot; suddenly becoming a profitable investment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter how many rabbit holes you go down, almost all end up at the true king of man, the almighty dollar.. </p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is the worst thing to ever happen to our country, Andrew Jackson considered his greatest achievement to beating the central bank.. Alexander Hamilton, the guy on the 10$ bill died in a duel over the central bank.. We are all slaves to this monetary system and those bullshit digital numbers on those plastic cards in our wallet..</p>

<p>Some quotes on the central bank...</p>

<p>&quot;It is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot;
-Henry Ford</p>

<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen. There is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this nation is run by the International bankers.&quot;
-Congressman Louis T. McFadden</p>

<p>“The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson.”
-Franklin Delano Roosevelt</p>

<p>&quot;This [Federal Reserve Act] establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President [Wilson} signs this bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized....the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.&quot;
-Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr. , 1913</p>

<p>&quot;Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money and control credit, and with a flick of a pen they will create enough to buy it back.&quot;
-Sir Josiah Stamp, former President, Bank of England</p>

<p>&quot;A great industrial nation is controlled by it&#39;s system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the world--no longer a government of free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of small groups of dominant men.&quot;
-President Woodrow Wilson</p>

<p>&quot;History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and it&#39;s issuance.&quot;
-James Madison</p>

<p>“The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes. I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. Of the two, the one at my rear is my greatest foe.”
-Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>And of course the grand architect of the whole system, the family with no loyalty to any flag or even humanity only the almighty dollar.. The Rothschild s</p>

<p>“The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from it’s profits or so dependent on it’s favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.”
-Rothschild Brothers of London, 1863</p>

<p>&quot;Give me control of a nation&#39;s money and I care not who makes it&#39;s laws&quot;
-Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild</p>

<p>Please do yourself and watch this doc on the Rothschilds, just to give yourself a little perspective on the whole thing...</p>
