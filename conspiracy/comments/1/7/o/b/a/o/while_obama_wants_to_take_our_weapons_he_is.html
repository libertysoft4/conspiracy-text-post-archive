They have already discarded most of our rights under the guise of &quot;fighting terrorism,&quot; and the idiots all eat it up.  What will it take?

    <div class="md"><p>That is such a cop out. The United States makes the rules when it comes to how they utilize the military. They can stop at ANY time. AND, the entire government has changed hands so any contracts we had would be considered void.</p>

<p>It would be like if you gave a small village 500 sheep per year, then some new group came in and destroyed the village and set up a new settlement in the same spot. Just because you are located in the same geographical area does not mean you are still locked into some kind of trading agreement.</p>

<p>And to the father of one of the children slain at Sandy Hook, I say that tragedies happen every day, in all parts of the world, to all types of people.  Sorry, but I don&#39;t believe my rights should be taken away because his child&#39;s life happened to end tragically.  I need the right to defend myself in any situation that may arise.  </p>

<p>God forbid there was ever an instance of looting or rioting in the future, where people would need the means to defend themselves in the absence of any others to help?  What would you do if the dollar collapsed, and all hell was breaking loose and you&#39;re sitting there in the dark with your wife and kids with a pistol, a few dull kitchen knives, and a broomhandle?

    <div class="md"><p>Cos they are very old and no one wants them. Would you rather they sit in a junk yard? Egypt are our allies with a democratically elected government. It is called making friends or diplomacy. NO ONE is trying to take away your guns (if you currently own a gun, you get to keep it, ok?), they are trying to make it harder to get a gun (back ground checks) and reducing the number of guns that can kill a lot of people in a short time. What is wrong with any of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even watch the news? All they talk about is &quot;gun control.&quot; They want to ban assault rifles, yet allow police to carry them. They want to introduce legislation that could set the groundwork for future restrictions on firearms for civilians. Now I am no gun-nut, I don&#39;t own a gun and hope to never have to use one, but if law enforcement are going to be armed to the teeth, then I need to be able to stand a fighting chance if the shit ever went down. Sorry, but I am not willing to blindly trust an entity that seems to be looking after everyone BUT it&#39;s own people. Why are they giving state of the art, American-made technology to a bunch of Muslims that probably want Americans dead?  Just seems a little questionable, especially given the state of the economy, the many executive orders being pushed through taking rights from citizens, and the chaotic regime situations around the world.</p>

Please provide a source. 2nd, you think the gov is helping everyone but their own people? What evidence do you have of that? the F-16&#39;s are not state of the art, they are really, really OLD. A bunch of Muslims? You mean our ALLIES?? They probably want Americans dead? Based on what? Your best guess?

    <div class="md"><p>Why? You just said private sellers doesn&#39;t need a check, up to 40% of guns sales are from private sellers or unlicensed gun dealers, gun shows, online purchases. Let&#39;s make ALL gun sales require a background check, make sense doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>they are trying to make it harder to get a gun (back ground checks)</p>

<p>Then you need to be more elaborate here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK... Universal background checks do not infringe your rights, the same as a pilots licence does not infringe. Currently 40% of gun sales are done WITHOUT background checks (yes, I was mistaken, all states have background checks on licensed gun shop purchases. However 40% of purchases are NOT background checked in like 29 states). It is those 40% of gun purchases that are killing people, agreeed, which is even more reason to have UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that you have somewhat educated yourself.  Regardless of a background check anyone is capable of a heinous crime.</p>

<p>Also your number seem way OFF, you realize there were 16.8 Million background checks done last year?  40% of non background checked citizens are going around killing people?  Say just 1% sold there guns to a private buyer.  That&#39;s 168000.  So there were 168000 murders last year with guns?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also don&#39;t get me wrong I agree everyone needs a background check and you can&#39;t just sell your weapons to anyone.  But it isn&#39;t going to stop people it will just make them more desperate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Didn&#39;t say that. Newark Major said they have next to none crimes committed with legal firearms, he also said the crimes they do have are committed with the 40% of non-background checked guns. How can anyone argue against EVERY gun being sole, being known for a fact to not be sold to mentally ill, criminals, etc. How can anyone argue against that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just one little area and 40% of that area. So Newark is just like Chicago, who btw have the strictest gun laws in America, Los Angles, Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, and Dallas/FW?  Doesn&#39;t make sense to compare one area to the rest of the United States so yes your number are still off.  </p>

<p>As for criminals and mentally ill it can happen at anytime regardless of age, race, gender even after you get your background check for the weapon you just purchased.  Background checks are not the answer.  To me that&#39;s not gun control.  </p>

<p>United States has ALWAYS been reactive rather than proactive.  Instead of preventing the accident they say &quot;OH SHIT&quot; we better fix this in a hurry.  The problem is they don&#39;t fix shit, they patch it up so they can get voted for next year but never looking at the long term effects.  </p>

<p>I think the answer on gun control is when someone buys a weapon, it will be theirs always and forever.  If they feel they don&#39;t want it anymore have it destroyed, period.  If you can&#39;t CONTROL your weapon you don&#39;t need one and in doing so you should be held accountable for ANYTHING that happens with it.  While there will be some cases theft, ect.  it will limit the weapons just floating around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we have common ground? That there is a problem that needs fixing? How about guns that can only be used by the single owner? As in biometric technology? And that they are only sold to people who are deemed &#39;fit&#39; for gun ownership?</p>

<p>How on Earth can you be against background checks? Yes they may not be perfect but it is better than nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number of gun crimes that are committed with a first hand, legally obtained gun is next to none. When guns change hands and/or are stolen, we see crime happen. Background checks punish law abiding citizens for no reason when the vast majority of gun crime isn&#39;t even from that source.</p>
