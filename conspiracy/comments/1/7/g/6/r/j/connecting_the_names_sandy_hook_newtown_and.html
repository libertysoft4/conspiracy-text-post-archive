<p>However, these two shootings trouble me from the standpoint of my own instincts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve wondered for awhile, based on the government buying ammunition, on the record number of deportations, and the record spying of the NDAA, if there isn&#39;t civil unrest really brewing.</p>

<p>I equate it to the message of the twin towers happening on 911 in the largest financial area of the country, to the Pentagon, etc., I&#39;ve wondered if the names involved have any significance.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, though not a history buff, the names Sandy Hook, Newtown, and Aurora are all names connected either to the military or to the civil war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting to find connections such as these but I often wonder why supposed conspirators would intentionally create links. So that people like us will find them? And then do what, expose the conspiracy? Or further alienate our ideas from mainstream opinions because these little connections are far fetched? To some it is another solid piece to the puzzle. To others it is an interesting little tid bit, and to many more it just makes conspiracy theories look silly. </p>

<p>Having said that, it shouldn&#39;t be a deterrent to follow any possible evidence you find, but always keep perspective and understand that some things just are pure coincidence.</p>

<p>Do I fully subscribe to this as reality?  Absolutely not.  Perhaps I am guilty of assuming everyone is sane, but note that I did take care to try not to frame this with a video, sensationalized music, and headlines.  If I were seeking attention or clicks, I would certainly post to a more mainstream subreddit.</p>

<p>I think that collectivists who never consider alternatives and those questioners who do both add value to a discussion.</p>

<p>Actually, one of the biggest flaws for humans is that we are pattern seeing machines. We easily and without effort make patterns where ones don&#39;t really exist. It&#39;s actually pretty fascinating and your post here is a great example of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff.  It probably explains why labels like &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; are so popular.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think I would have sought patterns to this seemingly random episode had the media been clear, concise, and factual. </p>

<p>Edit:  And there are some times where seemingly random acts are patterns, like terrorist attacks happening on 9-11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news media is an entertainment source. People love to say it&#39;s their job to provide only factual news. No, they are just an entertainment business looking to make money like anyone else. They are information vultures who will pick up any info they get, spice it up to sound interesting and throw it at the screen to keep peoples attentions.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t want to listen to oldschool Walter Cronkite drone on about facts, they want to see live helicopter footage of people getting shot. So if the news media actually waited to get proper information, they would be 3 days behind every other station out there.</p>

<p>Just go with the information from people like the police and medical examiners. If their stories have conflicts then you know there&#39;s a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, this is a FEMA newsletter for employees giving a heads up about important things occurring in the country. It was the day after the shooting and they had nothing to do with Sandy hook. </p>

<p>When you said that FEMA had a report I fully expected to see that FEMA had done some investigation and released a report, not a news snippet the day after the shooting.</p>

<p>This is all it says </p>

<p><strong>Friday, December 14, 2012 at 9:30 a.m. EST</strong></p>

<p>•  Mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT (pop. 27,560)</p>

<p>• 28 total confirmed fatalities (20 children, 7 adults, &amp; shooter)</p>

<p>• Shooters mother was shot/killed in her home; all other fatalities in the school
• Shooter was dressed in black camouflage &amp; bullet proof vest</p>

<p>• Two 9 mm handguns retrieved at the scene</p>

<p>• Additional weapon (Bushmaster Rifle) found in shooters vehicle</p>

<p>• Investigation expected to last through the weekend</p>

<p>It even says as the last point that there is an investigation. How do you suppose this is a FEMA report about the shooting? It&#39;s just 24 hours after the shooting and it only contains a tiny snippet within a newsletter.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think a report would be pages upon pages of info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to note that the New York Times says that there is a very &quot;limited&quot; connection between Benghazi and Al Qaeda. If they were attempting to celebrate an anniversary of 9/11 by attacking in Benghazi, one would assume that the connections would have been more publicized. Does this make the date more likely to be a coincidence or was it just another example of not responding to intelligence? Or, was it a case of purposely not acting on intelligence reports in order to get the headline watchers to see another terrorist attack in the middle east and continue to perpetuate the war on terror?</p>

<p>That would be assuming that the media was actually doing their job.  Again, a matter of opinion.</p>

<p>From the sidelines, however, which is all I will ever be, it seems fairly common sense to assume that the chosen date is meaningful.  More common sense than my speculative post, for example.</p>

<p>There are degrees to everything, including conspiracy speculation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on what I&#39;ve heard up to this point, I&#39;m fairly confident that something was allowed to happen in Benghazi. If you compare intelligence info in Benghazi to 9/11 in NY, much of the baseline concern about the U.S. being attacked came from outside of the U.S. The alleged reports of a need for increased security around the embassy in Benghazi came from around Benghazi. It seems that it would be easier for the U.S. to ignore reports of an imminent attack on our soil (given our feeling of national security prior to that day) than it would have been to ignore requests for more security from right there on the ground in Libya. Both of these incidents stink to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully understand and accept that truth.  In the face of one person&#39;s limited ability to connect possible dots, I thought maybe others could add research and facts.  I&#39;m interested, but not fanatically so. </p>

<p>Do I fully subscribe to this as reality?  Absolutely not.  Perhaps I am guilty of assuming everyone is sane, but note that I did take care to try not to frame this with a video, sensationalized music, and headlines.  If I were seeking attention or clicks, I would certainly post to a more mainstream subreddit.</p>

<p>I think that collectivists who never consider alternatives and those questioners who do both add value to a discussion.</p>

<p>Actually, one of the biggest flaws for humans is that we are pattern seeing machines. We easily and without effort make patterns where ones don&#39;t really exist. It&#39;s actually pretty fascinating and your post here is a great example of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, this is a FEMA newsletter for employees giving a heads up about important things occurring in the country. It was the day after the shooting and they had nothing to do with Sandy hook. </p>

<p>When you said that FEMA had a report I fully expected to see that FEMA had done some investigation and released a report, not a news snippet the day after the shooting.</p>

<p>This is all it says </p>

<p><strong>Friday, December 14, 2012 at 9:30 a.m. EST</strong></p>

<p>•  Mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT (pop. 27,560)</p>

<p>• 28 total confirmed fatalities (20 children, 7 adults, &amp; shooter)</p>

<p>• Shooters mother was shot/killed in her home; all other fatalities in the school
• Shooter was dressed in black camouflage &amp; bullet proof vest</p>

<p>• Two 9 mm handguns retrieved at the scene</p>

<p>• Additional weapon (Bushmaster Rifle) found in shooters vehicle</p>

<p>• Investigation expected to last through the weekend</p>

<p>It even says as the last point that there is an investigation. How do you suppose this is a FEMA report about the shooting? It&#39;s just 24 hours after the shooting and it only contains a tiny snippet within a newsletter.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think a report would be pages upon pages of info.</p>
