        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While browsing this subreddit, i found this:<br/>
<a href="http://zombietime.com/john_holdren/">http://zombietime.com/john_holdren/</a>
Apparently John Holdren, the current Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, and Co-Chair of the President&#39;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology -- informally known as the United States&#39; &quot;Science Czar&quot;, wrote a book in the 70s pertaining to &quot; Forced abortions and mass sterilization needed to save the planet&quot;. One of his prepositions was to put chemicals in food and beverages we consume in order to make us infertile, thus controlling the population.
If you haven&#39;t heard recently in the news, countries are banning chemicals that are found in most soft drinks: Sprite, Gatorade, Fanta... (The list goes on). I have found that all of these drinks are under either the PepsiCola, Coca-Cola, or DrPepper Snapple Group label. All of these companies are based in the United States. 
The chemical most widely criticized as of late is Brominated Vegetable Oil. It also must be noted that you often will not find this chemical listed on the individual bottles of these products. </p>

<p>This is a brief summary of Brominated Vegetable Oil&#39;s side effects:</p>

<p>Also used as a flame retardant, Brominated Vegetable Oil has been banned for consumption in approximately 100 countries. Bromine has been added to vegetable oil since 1931 to help citrus flavours stay suspended in drinks. However, over time, this chemical accumulates in the body – including in breast milk – which can cause problems with neurological development, FERTILITY, PUBERTY AND THYROID HORMONES. Brominated Vegetable Oil remains in fat tissues for long periods of time and displaces iodine, which can depress thyroid function, leading to depression, memory loss, hallucinations, violent tendencies, psychosis, seizures, ataxia, confusion, vision impairment, slurred speech, loss of muscle co-ordination, and headaches.
Several studies performed on rats throughout the 1970’s showed that bromine can REDUCE REPRODUCTIVE RATES, heighten behavioural problems, cause heart lesions, CAUSE TESTICULAR DAMAGE, and stunt growth.&quot;
-This information was taken from a website that warns potential parents wanting to reproduce, of this harmful chemical.</p>

<p>source- <a href="http://makeababy.ca/Brominated-Vegetable-Oil-nid-146.html">http://makeababy.ca/Brominated-Vegetable-Oil-nid-146.html</a></p>

<p>Could it be that John Holdren, now in a position of power (with the approval of Barack Obama), finally carried out his plan of depopulation by facilitating the addition of Brominated Vegetable Oil into many of our nations soft drinks? The FDA has continuously let this harmful chemical, as well as other dangerous chemicals pass inspection. Gatorade, only one of the many drinks that contains the chemical, is just now stating that they will take the chemical out of the product. The United States arguably has the loosest FDA. Is there a reason behind this? I think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bromine is a poisonous gas at slightly above SATP, and forms several poisonous compounds. On that note, carbon and oxygen can combine to form the extremely poisonous carbon monoxide molecule.

    <div class="md"><p>Very possibly. I don&#39;t know enough about the science to say, but the FDA isn&#39;t lax on restrictions. There may emerge evidence that it should be stopped as a practise, in which case I would agree that it should be stopped, but at this time I would rather urge people not to blow this out of proportion. We don&#39;t need any more anti-vaccine or anti-fluoride type of &quot;movements&quot; than we already have.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_vegetable_oil">Now that I look into it</a>, it appears that there aren&#39;t many recognized issues with brominated vegetable oils. I would question your sources above all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think those views are very radical at all. Not popular, unorthodox, yes. But our world is already severely overpopulated by humans. We are destroying the entire ecosystem at lightning speed. In highly populated countries, the filth and disease and competition for resources makes life horrid for the masses. Population control is a <em>very</em> good idea. </p>

<p>Everyone assumes that it is their right to have as many babies as they want, and the planets resources are being raped because of it. I decided not to reproduce long ago, for a number of reasons. But this factored into that decision a bit. But I have to breathe poisoned air and work harder to pay more for everything because of the competition from the hundreds of millions of families who have 3+ kids. I try to live in a sustainable manner (although of course I could do a lot better), while masses of ignorant people pollute the planet and consume its resources like plagued rats. Fuck them. Put <strong>MORE</strong> birth control in their drinks. They refuse to reproduce responsibly, so I don&#39;t think they should be allowed to reproduce anymore. I say we adopt a China-esque 1 child family rule for the entire planet. When we do get back down to around a half billion people, who live in harmony with Mother Nature, and people live and thrive - and the rest of the living beings on this planet finally get to as well - then those ideas won&#39;t seem so horrible. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Fuck humans. There are way too many already, we <em>should</em> be forcing sterilization (although forced abortions are a stretch and would be unnecessary if people were sterilized after one child).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sterilized, sure. I never meant killing people though. But I think that we should really do it in a more targeted manner - allow couples to have up to 2 kids, then no more. Actually, only couples that actually can take care of kids should be allowed to have them. There would be a whole lot of issues making all that happen in a humane way, but that would be my ideal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s desperation you&#39;re feeling. The programming is working. I have no issue with the thought of population control... but just who gets to decide what population to control, and how? Are you comfortable not knowing? Are you willing to sacrifice this knowing for personal comfort and displaced responsibility? If so, welcome to the new world order..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a thread back in September that spoke of the dangers of brominated vegetable oil.  The information I read was enough to convince me to quit drinking Mt Dew cold turkey.  This statement says a lot if you know that it&#39;s been my favorite soda since 7th grade and I was known in middle and high school as the guy to go to for all of your black market soda needs.  I was also legitimately addicted to PepsiCo&#39;s product in the 9th grade when I began to experience withdrawals if I went 6 hours without one.  Who knows what damage I caused to my body?  Anyways,  I&#39;ve only had Mt Dew 3 times since September.  The <em>last</em> time I had it was last week when I was like &#39;what the hey; I&#39;ll drink a Mt Dew today&#39;.  Well, I won&#39;t be having anymore of those days because upon drinking only a quarter of the 16 oz bottle I began to experience an upset stomach and a very weird headache. It felt like I had been poisoned and I have concluded that that was the case indeed.</p>
