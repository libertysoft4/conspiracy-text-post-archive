    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve felt the same about numerous instances in the media. Some are obviously conspiracies, such as the seattle anarchists. I mean really it&#39;s feds fishing for the right kinds of people that they can push and manipulate into whatever actions they want, and then they swoop in to say &quot;hey we saved the day&quot; without mentioning that it was them who were starting trouble in the first place. TDKR in colorado is one of the first that I think was meant to push for just gun legislation as opposed to patriot act powers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could entirely be a multi-stage plot to push gun legislation, which clearly was the first thing that sprouted up. This has done a great job at pushing the sales of guns through the roofs and making bullets near impossible to find. </p>

<p>Secondly, dividing the populace. Gun control has always been a major debate, right up next to abortion. People either love guns, or hate guns, and there aren&#39;t many in-between. By separating the people and having them focus on smaller issues, it&#39;s easier to control them since they spend all their time fighting each other and not paying attention to the big picture.</p>

<p>The third motion would be to discredit conspiracy theorists, especially since 9/11 trials just started, there are numerous undeclared wars, the economy is going to hell, and anti-government sentiments have been running high, especially since OWS, and NDAA 2013 passed silently, without provisions to protect American citizens and indicates that protests are anti-American and terroristic in nature. But what is everyone talking about now...gun control, and anyone who doesn&#39;t believe Sandy Hook happened - and by extension anything reported on the mass media - must be insane and terrorists.</p>

<p>Except that school shootings are a dime a dozen in the USA. When the smoke clears (so to speak) this will just be one of scores of shootings in recent years, albeit with more unanswered questions than most shootings.</p>

<p>I think there have been enough school shootings in the USA (and there is a resonable expectation of them continuing) without the government needing to stage one to push gun reforms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is exactly what makes this one suspicious. A lot of people think Columbine was the first staged school shooting, but that involved a bunch of high schoolers. Actually, most school shootings involve teenagers, and while that is tragic, it doesn&#39;t have the national knee-jerk reaction that killing <em>poor, defenseless 6 and 7 year olds</em> does.</p>

<p>Looking at it, people were sad about Columbine, but they moved on. Then there was Santee, CA where 2 people died and 13 were injured at a <em>high school</em> and no one heard about it. 2005 10 people died and 5 were wounded at a <em>high school</em> in Minnesota, and again, not major news. Virginia Tech 2007, a bunch of <em>college students</em> die, it makes the news but not enough to spur much more than a whimper of gun control. 2008 in Illinois 6 people killed and 21 are wounded in a <em>college</em>, and it barely makes the news. But then, out of nowhere in 2012, the statistically highest death:wounded ratio that far surpasses any other school shooting just happens to occur where a bunch of <em>innocent, helpless kids were</em>, resulting in a massive gun control knee-jerk reaction where some legislations were passed within weeks of the tragedy happening.</p>

<p>Then there have been six incidents since, which resulted in 1 or 2 deaths at most, all occurring in colleges or high schools, and were minimally reported aside from the one in Houston.</p>

<p>Look at the Sandy Hook incident - some kid that is essentially &quot;invisible&quot;, had no trackable online presence yet spent most of his time on a computer, diagnosed with developmental disorders randomly kills a bunch of young kids and teachers for the first time in recent history, with incredible accuracy and no training, and no weapons of his own. Compare that to Virginia Tech, where a highly intelligent guy kills 30+ people and wounds 20+. That guy had a vast history that is well documented, including psychiatric evaluations, who legally purchased the weapons he used.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry - I just have a little trouble understanding his usage of phrases like &quot;1 stands above 30&quot;. These aren&#39;t ghost stories, it&#39;s very simple to discuss, yet he doesn&#39;t write clearly. </p>

<p>That sounds like some sort of CNN factoid to me. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d only believe the mainstream narrative parts that reinforce alternative theories. </p>

<p>This has been done for years, it&#39;s just one more thing to add to that list. Gay marriage, abortion, there&#39;s always going to be a bunch of people on each side who feel very strongly about it. </p>

<p>Elections are yet another way of doing this - as if it matters who is in the White House. This serves two purposes: to again divide the population, and to give the people the feeling that they actually have the power to make a difference. Win/win.</p>

<p>Your third point might have been an after-effect of this, concious or unconscious, but it&#39;s not like they really needed any more ammunition against us. From where i&#39;m sitting, we don&#39;t pose much of a threat at all to the establishment as it stands. It&#39;s something to watch out for though - we all know how they like to take &#39;preventative&#39; actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tl;dr Max Igan suggests Sandy Hook is a trap, that the 2nd amendment is the bait in order to draw people into conflict.</p>

<p>Max Igan, in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgaBw9txktY">&quot;Project/Operation Sandy Hook Explained&quot;</a>, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>23:10   &quot;But I think it&#39;s incredibly important for the people of the United States -- the ones who are rushing out there and buying arms and getting ready for a big showdown -- I think it&#39;s very, very important for these people to understand that what the government wants here is conflict.  And the best thing that could happen for the government, at the moment, is for the people to make a stand against the government in an armed uprising.  It&#39;s absolutely what they want.  </p>

<p>&quot;I think if the guns are there and people will simply make a peaceful stand (sure, keep your gun at your side but don&#39;t point it at anybody) -- make a peaceful stand against the government, and let them know enough is enough, I think you still have the ability to change things.  But people have to keep it clearly in mind that the best thing they can do for the government at the moment is to start a civil war, because that&#39;s what the government wants.  That&#39;s what all this is about, folks.  It isn&#39;t just an attack against the 2nd Amendment.  The 2nd Amendment is the bait that they are using to create the conflict that they want, and they have set up for this conflict well in advance.  They have put all the FEMA camps in place, they&#39;ve militarized the police over the last few years.  They&#39;ve given them sound canons, and microwave canons, drones.  They&#39;ve just supplied them with millions upon millions of hollow points, and they are ready.  And they are like the bully in the schoolyard that is taunting the population and simply itching for conflict.    Because once that conflict happens, they will crack down with such blinding force that if the people are not fully organized, then they will be crushed... </p>

<p>&quot;What this mechanism is pushing for, folks, is conflict.  That&#39;s what this is all about.  That&#39;s what they want in the United States right now, is conflict.  So you must not give it to them.  You must draw up articles of impeachment, even if you have to impeach the entire executive branch.  You got to understand that there are domestic enemies that have taken over your country.  </p>

<p>&quot;Just this attack on the 2nd Amendment shows you that these are domestic enemies...  This is treason, folks. </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>This is a coup.  America is being stolen by forces from within.  The only people who can fix the situation are the American people.  So it&#39;s time to stand up, and it&#39;s time to restore the Republic.</strong>&quot;</p>

Do you think that the section of the Pentagon  containing the offices responsible for the investigation into the 9 trillion missing from the federal reserve (that rumsfield announced the day before) that was destroyed  was just a lucky coincidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read the article?</p>

<p>It&#39;s stating that exposure to conspiracy theories regardless of validity has a tangible effect on those being exposed. It doesn&#39;t really address or attack any theories.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is a Canadian article. Unless you are proposing that a Canadian article is trying to discredit a largely American theory by targeting Canadian readers it doesn&#39;t really apply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>willy loman has referenced this, too. i fully entertain the notion that whether or not theorists are onto a state terror act, the media does seem to be attempting to motivate large numbers of people by showing the most absurd BS &#39;theories&#39; they can find, and attacking the character and sanity of anyone who seems to stand on the wrong side of camp. </p>

<p>i believe an argument can be made that policy makers are attempting to turn historical skepticism into a communicable disease, as well. viewed as a whole, it is possible to make a case that certain authors, state figures (cass sunstein), media figures, bloggers, psychiatrists, and scientists are attempting to turn conspiracy theorizing into a clinical diagnosis, with popular acceptance of this new raceless, classless popular social and political marginalization. </p>

<p>citing the above sources, people become acclimated to thinking conspiracy theorists need medication, jail, or worse authoritarian methods of censorship, and see no problem wishing for them to get hit by busses, fall down stairs, choke and die. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve read the comments. i&#39;m sure you have, too. this rift is growing, and i believe will roughly form the populations of the &#39;sides&#39; of what i see as a forthcoming civil conflict, when the real conflict should be between the mutually manipulated against the manipulating financial cartels that have our country&#39;s policies within their opaque influence. </p>

<p>Yes.  Max Igan&#39;s analysis of the Sandy Hook psy-op is the best articulation I&#39;ve seen of the impact and deliberate design of these calibrated steps being taken to shape public opinion and action.  His video, Project Sandy Hook Explained, is really a must watch.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Synopsis from the book Going Postal.</p>

<p>&quot;An eye-opening look at the phenomenon of school and workplace shootings in America, Going Postal explores the rage-murder phenomenon that has plagued — and baffled — America for the last three decades, and offers some provocative answers to the oft-asked question, &quot;Why?&quot; By juxtaposing the historical place of rage in America with the social climate that has existed since the 1980s — when Reaganomics began to widen the gap between executive and average-worker earnings — the author crafts a convincing argument that these schoolyard and office massacres can be seen as modern-day slave rebellions. He presents many fascinating and unexpected cases in detail. Like slave rebellions, these massacres are doomed, gory, sometimes even inadvertently comic, and grossly misunderstood. Taking up where Bowling for Columbine left off, this book seeks to set these murders in their proper context and thereby reveal their meaning.&quot;</p>

Where you can find a Canadian newspaper&#39;s mobile page about the event, but the strange thing was that the article was dated <a href="http://mobiledevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/folder/sandy-hook-ct.html">September 04th, 2012 right on the top of page</a>.  The commentator was saying how this was proof that it was known before hand.  But then I decided to look around the site by going here 
<a href="http://mobiledevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/folder/">http://mobiledevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/folder/</a>  and found the html file in question (sandy-hook-ct.html) along with it&#39;s related jpgs  (they all started with sandy-hook-ct<em>.</em>) .

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think that once the world being round was a conspiracy.</p>

<p>I mean, until things are proven true they are seen as conspiracy, and if they are EVER proven true the conspiracy theorists &quot;got lucky&quot; or get no credit at all for looking at things more critically. To not question what someone tells you doesn&#39;t make you better... </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe all the ones I see out there, but when so many conspiracy theories have been proven correct through time I have to take a moment and look at information for myself. What people tell you and what is truth are frequently different, even if just ever so slightly. I wish that people would stop being so offended by curiosity and doubt. </p>

<p>You can disagree at any time! Opinions differ, it isn&#39;t a direct assault on you or your beliefs that I disagree. So when people are portrayed as nut jobs and tin foil hat crazies I feel truly disappointed. I would love to see a world where conspiracy theorists are respected when they were right and given the benefit of an open mind when either wrong or even just questioning. I would also love to see that go the other direction, conspiracy can be wrong and people who disagree with you should add to your understanding of an issue, even if it is just the understanding that there are differing opinions out there, rather than offending you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we can deduce that at least one event was staged, faked - a complete hoax that manipulates the public&#39;s view on a particular situation then we have the utmost authority to question any official story. </p>

<p>Of course everybody will think of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. So, it&#39;s only fair, and right for us the people, to question everything that the government does and to know the truth, because if we know that we have been lied to before to go to war...then you can be damn sure we have been lied to about other things.</p>

<p>I think that Sandy hook has multiple levels of manipulation. Manipulation as everybody suspects to push gun control and at the same time, discredit conspiracy theorists or as I prefer to call us, truth seekers or realists for not falling into blind submission to the media and government. It doesn&#39;t end here though, as shootings arise, or are reported more often than before we will see a growing rise in gun sales (as we have already seen) and see more states go against the grain and fight against gun disarmament (like we have already seen) and what&#39;s the end goal? Civil war, or as close to it as possible. It&#39;s quite clear this is what is going to happen. <del>Barack Obama</del> &quot;the powers that be&quot; won&#39;t step down. </p>

<p>As an outsider of the US, boy does it stink of plans to initiate a dictatorship.  Just look at the laws trying to be put into place. It&#39;s nuts to think people would be more than willing for it to happen. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not Obama, it&#39;s not Bush, it&#39;s not Clinton, etc...It&#39;s the people ABOVE them.</p>

<p>Think of it like a ball club...You got your players, the congress and house and politicians etc, you got your manager, the POTUS, you got your general managers, the bank and companies that control the wealth, and then you have your owners...the religions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yea, that was how they did that; made everyone dismiss conspiracy theorists with that stunt Alex Jones pulled on Piers Morgan&#39;s show. Yep, we had them completely fucked on Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget Anderson Cooper&#39;s interviews with &quot;the parents&quot; and the one where he called us &quot;sickening&quot; and &quot;ignorant&quot; for what we discovered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the point I like to make.  I don&#39;t care what people think really happened with 9/11 or Sandy Hook, but look at what those events led to.</p>

<p>9/11 - &quot;War on Terror&quot; (Within 10 years crude oil becomes our biggest import, and Refined becomes our biggest export.) And let&#39;s not forget the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook - Immediate strengthened gun regulation.</p>

<p>Yet Kim Jong Un can sit around and tell us he&#39;s going to try and blow us to smithereens while performing terrible crimes against humanity.  But who gives a fuck?  There&#39;s no oil in North Korea.</p>
