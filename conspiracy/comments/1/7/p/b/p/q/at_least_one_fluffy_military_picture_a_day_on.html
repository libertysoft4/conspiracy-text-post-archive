<p>Anyway I&#39;ve had to unsub <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> because it&#39;s just pissing me off to much to see this shit every day and when I speak out about it I end up -100 karma for the day. That&#39;s getting old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that post was pretty awful and obviously propaganda as well. If it was legit and true they would be putting their posts in <a href="/r/military">/r/military</a> or something. They have to know that posting in the regular subreddits pisses some people right off and results in nastiness. </p>

<p>Well if they blamed the Druze or the Welsh for every single thing, and yet offered no proof. It would always be the Welsh, but they don&#39;t blame the Welsh or any other minority for all the world&#39;s ills, just the Jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have proof it is propaganda. It is fact that the pentagon runs a social media unit. Reddit is one of the largest social media and marketing sites in the world right now. </p>

<p>After that unit was established suddenly reddit begins seeing posts like that one I am talking about. Posts that are all fluffy fluffy nice nice about the military. We also know that the military believes in such concepts as &quot;winning hearts and minds,&quot; and using softpower to gain influence. That is exactly what these sorts of posts are doing and so coupled with the fact that the pentagon is spending resources on social media I think I got a case.</p>

<p>All you have is, &quot;oh no it&#39;s not propaganda, where is your proof?&quot;</p>

<p>Since I have more proof than you do I think that about finishes this discussion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny that. Do you have proof linking said redditor to this social media unit? How do you know he&#39;s not a regular redditor?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where is your proof?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The burden of proof lies on you, you came up with the idea. I could go around telling people I can fly, and when they tell me I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll just tell them to prove I can&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you can&#39;t prove that certain people online are paid by the government to post things. However, if you use some judgement, it&#39;s pretty obvious this is the case. You don&#39;t have to believe us, no one is forcing it on you. Next time you see military propaganda-like posts, just take a look at the account history of OP. Often they are new accounts (within 10 - 15 days) and have only posted nonsense in other subs. This is not something you can ever prove, but requires a little bit of logic. Even the Israeli government has admitted to commenting on sites and infiltrating social medias. Why wouldn&#39;t the US do the same?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say the US wouldn&#39;t do, after all the Pentagon has a social media unit as OP said. I just asked for proof that this was the case in point since the redditor who posted said picture to r/pics has been a redditor for 5 months. He also posted the same picture to r/ladybonersgonecuddly, again I don&#39;t deny that the Pentagon uses social media, but that just doesn&#39;t seem to be the case here.</p>

<p>I realize I don&#39;t have to believe it, but if you&#39;re gonna make a claim you should be able to back it up.</p>

<p>How does a picture of a soldier and their dog make the <strong>entire military</strong> look any different? Are you suggesting this photo is staged? Or maybe you are suggesting that soldiers don&#39;t have dogs as pets? <strong>OR MAYBE IT&#39;S JUST SOMEONE WITH THEIR DOG WHO HAPPENS TO BE IN THE MILITARY.</strong></p>

<p>No shit, sherlock. What do you think the purpose of any military is?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and empire</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so? Yes, we have bases in many countries, but we do not run those countries or govern them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that is what history will record and say about us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you&#39;re a historian now? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All this soldiers and their dogs is just pure fucking hogwash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s just a soldier with their dog. I don&#39;t know if you know this, but their are a shit-ton of people in the military. Many of them use reddit. Many of them (just like a good portion of redditors) also want upvotes and karma. </p>

<p>Unless you have proof of your claims that this is propaganda, you&#39;d do well to stop posting and delete this thread. No one needs your paranoid delusions or insane rants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See... this is just retarded. You are so ignorant as to think that in order to be an empire the map itself has to say EMPIRE OF UNITED STATES huh? </p>

<p>Connect the fucking dots. We have military bases all over the world. Our soldiers have their feet on the ground in something like 150 different countries. Look it up!</p>

<p>Not only that but we control the politics and flow of resources in many of those countries. We exploit the shit out of them and that makes them our provinces. We control those nations and thus they are a part of our empire. Please try and understand this very important reality. </p>

<p>This might help. Look at it from the historical point of view. Imagine you are a historian 100 years from now. How else could you possibly characterize these deployments, occupations and resource grabbing ventures? </p>

<p>You know as for the pictures the fact is I was subscribed to the <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> subreddit. Which meant that I had to see the thumbnails and read the headlines of base rank ass propaganda and it pisses me off. If those assholes took their shit to <a href="/r/militarypics">/r/militarypics</a> then I&#39;d have nothing to say and nothing to see.</p>

<p>How does a picture of a soldier and their dog make the <strong>entire military</strong> look any different? Are you suggesting this photo is staged? Or maybe you are suggesting that soldiers don&#39;t have dogs as pets? <strong>OR MAYBE IT&#39;S JUST SOMEONE WITH THEIR DOG WHO HAPPENS TO BE IN THE MILITARY.</strong></p>

<p>No shit, sherlock. What do you think the purpose of any military is?</p>

<p>and empire</p>

<p>How so? Yes, we have bases in many countries, but we do not run those countries or govern them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that is what history will record and say about us.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re a historian now? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All this soldiers and their dogs is just pure fucking hogwash.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s just a soldier with their dog. I don&#39;t know if you know this, but their are a shit-ton of people in the military. Many of them use reddit. Many of them (just like a good portion of redditors) also want upvotes and karma. </p>

<p>Unless you have proof of your claims that this is propaganda, you&#39;d do well to stop posting and delete this thread. No one needs your paranoid delusions or insane rants. </p>
