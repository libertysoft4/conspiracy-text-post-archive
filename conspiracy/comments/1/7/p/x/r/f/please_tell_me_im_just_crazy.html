I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that a great many things are playing off of each other and involved in yes, &quot;a global conspiracy&quot;. </p>

<p>My concern is that this is far too heinous to accept. If I do accept these possibilities as realities then my entire lifes plan has to be readjusted accordingly. </p>

<p>I know I&#39;m smart, not just because I got good grades but because intelligence is a measure of cognizance, deductive reasoning, logic, and ones ability to apply them cohesively for an end result of understanding. </p>

<p>This is obviously why one would get good grades, and universally as opposed to in just one field. </p>

<p>With that said, I&#39;m skeptical of much, motivated to discern, and capable of hypothesizing. </p>

<p>With so  many things happening all at once to reshape our world, someone please tell me I&#39;m just crazy, and not smart. I want to go back to a blissful ignorant existence, but I can&#39;t of my own accord.</p>

<p>So, one of us is clearly not very smart.

    <div class="md"><p>I see where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

<p>I only cite intellect in reference to grades because if exercising the inherent qualities necessary to achieve, anyone can have good grades because it all boils down to effort or will/want to. </p>

<p>Most of the people in my closed minded small town only correlate intelligence to your gpa, thus by having good grades everyone always told me &quot;your so smart&quot;, which is annoying in truth because living an ordinary existence only makes a person neurotic about wasting said intelligence. </p>

<p>Often though, I&#39;ve seen those who I know are smarter then me purposely sabotage their grades as a way of rebelling against the purported definition of intelligence. </p>

<p>Do it, then you&#39;ll have a dog in the fight.  As opposed to just sitting back and letting it unfold.  Since becoming awake I bought a house, had a kid and will probably get married soon.  Now I care more than ever!  The biggest threat in the US right now is Agenda 21 which is why I started my little sub there, it is driving up the property taxes every single year because of the measures being taken locally and at the state level.  I can see it unfolding so, now I&#39;m fighting it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, it&#39;s everywhere.  I cannot believe more people haven&#39;t woken up to it.  Problem is, is that the media won&#39;t point out that almost every medium/large city has a new &quot;sustainability&quot; plan that is literally word for word uniform with every other plan in every other city.  That is how they are getting this through, localization. </p>

<p>They are lateral/flexible thinkers; less suggestible than average; less hidebound by ideology. They are people who are able to tolerate uncertainty (ie juggle multiple possible explanations for an event) and yet are highly driven to find which of those explanations is actually the truth, however difficult that may be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are crazy. Everything is fine and is what you were lead to believe by those in society around you.  You had the best publicly funded education tax dollars could buy that is light years ahead of anything those farmers had available to them in the 1800s.  It did a great job of catching you up on all that you needed to know by the time you were 18.  You now should have a basic understanding of civics, algebra, electrons etc. and a basic understanding of what is expected from you and normal socialized behaviors.</p>

<p>You have a media that lets you know if anything is amiss or corrupt. I mean they let you know when a few bad apples in Britain were fudging some numbers at the bank with that whole LIBOR thing. If there were any other scandals they would let you know.</p>

<p>You live in a representational democracy where the leaders are beholden to the will of the people and if they ever got corrupted or abused their power, we the people would vote them out of office.  Remember the last time that things went awry? It was the McCarthy era. We learned about it in school.  People then found that when government abuses started occurring our amazing system of checks and balances kicked in and righted the wrongs and we learned from that experience. If anything were wrong like that now, we&#39;d know about it.</p>

<p>We live in an amazing democracy where people can give voice to whatever belief or misguided notion they may have. Remember that whole Occupy thing?  I mean we know they were a bunch of Communist sympathizers who didn&#39;t even know what they were protesting (except a general dissatisfaction for some reason with our beloved Capatalist way of life). The government let them say their piece even though they clearly had misguided and wrongful beliefs. Why, there was even a small group of tents in my town.  They were children who had never lived in the other societies they were idolizing, but let them live in Cuba for a day and they&#39;d come around.</p>

<p>9/11.  That was performed by a group of Muslim extremists who happened to exploit a security flaw in the US infrastructure. They hated our way of life because we have promiscuous women and don&#39;t follow their religious beliefs. They feel that since we don&#39;t believe like they do that our culture might undermine their societal structures when the people in their countries see how great everything is here due to our free democratized Capatalist society. </p>

<p>Thus we need the war on terror.  This is to ensure we root out and protect those who might seek to replicate 9/11 style attacks.  Now sure mistakes have been made and it turns out there weren&#39;t any WMDs in Iraq. But never attribute to malice that which can be ascribed to ineptitude.  Sure a few blunders happen but we&#39;re in uncharted waters here.  Even the enhanced interrogation techniques are necessary these days.  Though a bit messy we need them because they could stop an attack in a quick fashion and save countless lives.</p>

<p>We learned everything bad that could happen from the past and observing the atrocities of World War II. As they taught us in school these things can never happen again because we learned. A few other things you might be concerned about that are no cause for concern. Sweat shops and the possible exploitation and abuses of those in the developing countries: Our beneficial corporations are bringing jobs and prosperity to these poor people that had no opportunities before. They can&#39;t be blamed for the exchange rate. The 19 cents an hour they make goes much farther there than it would here. The companies learned that it&#39;s bad business to abuse the employees after the Kathy Lee Gifford scandal and Nike&#39;s bad press following the revelations of their practices. They now have strict internal standards to make sure that sort of thing doesn&#39;t happen as the market punishes businesses who don&#39;t have strong employment rights.</p>

<p>Which brings us to unions. They&#39;re bad. They add another layer of corruption and bureaucracy and cause inefficient non competitive businesses.</p>

<p>The GMO&#39;S you may have heard about? Perfectly fine. The FDA says so. The one claim about them being harmful was a study done by a French guy who had an agenda. The companies that &quot;sue farmers for patent infringement after cross pollination from the wind?&quot; An urban legend created after a Canadian canola farmer who blatantly stole the seeds used that excuse in court as his defense in 1999.</p>

<p>Banks and Fraud? We already went over how the media and our government institutions catch the few bad apples that try to get away with any chicanery. If there were any other problems we&#39;d know about them. We have government institutions like the NSA and FBI who monitor most communications. They would surely catch any fraudulent activity as it is in their best interest because tax dollars get used to prop up markets whenever a market implosion happens due to fraud or bad business decisions. Which 2008&#39;s market implosion was a result of. Bad business decisions. Ineptitude, not malice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ok. You were starting to go crazy reading all the crazy talk on the Internet. You forgot rule #1 that you were taught in school. Don&#39;t trust anything on the Internet. Even Wikipedia is an unreliable source. It can all be written by  anyone giving rise to wild rumors and speculation being treated as fact.</p>

<p>Go back to bed. Everything is fine. Everything is under CONTROL...</p>
