<p>The victim is a family member this time, so it&#39;s personal. All the other police shootings, &quot;oops&quot; wrong house, or &#39;oh... he &quot;had a gun&quot;&#39; incidents up until now have outraged me. But this one makes me incensed, to know that my cousin who was doing nothing at all wrong is now gone simply because he... what exactly can I say here? He wasn&#39;t doing anything, just sleeping, and now he&#39;s gone because of two over-zealous cops. He waited for his girlfriend there every night and I do not for one second believe that he pulled a gun on the cops. He would never do anything like that.</p>

<p>I just want everyone to know that this can happen to anyone, and when it happens to you or someone you love, you begin to see things in a completely different light. </p>

<p>Edit ~thanks everyone for your kind words and sympathy.</p>

<p>HS Graduate, no record, valid carry permit.
What do we think the odds will be that any dash camera footage exists?
This is the third fatal shooting by Memphis police in as many weeks.</p>

<p>In all <a href="http://www.abc24.com/news/local/story/15-Killed-in-MPD-Officer-Involved-Shootings-over/IIpugRLDYUylrthtxKvIJg.cspx">15 fatal police shootings</a> in the past year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Director Armstrong told abc24.com his officers &quot;are trained to shoot until they neutralize the threat.&quot; Armstrong added it&#39;s never a good day any time an officer has to kill someone, but the job of a protector of peace is a dangerous one. &quot;Our officers are faced with this on a daily basis.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/grim-statistics/Content?oid=3326627">Some statistics</a></p>

<p>157 murders in Memphis last year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Memphis police director Toney Armstrong said around 90 percent of last year&#39;s homicides involved individuals who knew one another.</p>

<p>In 2012, more than 80 percent of Memphis&#39; homicides involved firearms.</p>

<p>According to MPD statistics, African-American males under the age of 25 commit most of the city&#39;s homicides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, but to me this looks like this unfortunate young man was doing all he could to avoid becoming a statistic and ends up becoming one at the hands of the police. So very, very sad. </p>

<p>It would be easy to speculate on what happened, I can only hope that the truth comes out and all the families involved find peace.</p>

<p>Again, my deepest condolences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On another forum, a well known cop (has shown pix for years there) said shoplifters should be shot if a thread about a drug store manager choking a homeless man to death over toothpaste. He routinely tolerates stories like these and throws his virtual weight around because the site owner has a cop in the family and allows no cop bashing. I believe police are recruited these days based solely on having this holier than thou mindset. The recruiting process takes 6 months and several psychological evaluations. Ive been asked to apply to several firms when i was in security- offering free schooling if i signed on with a certain dept, college classes, and was told &quot;no matter what I do it&#39;ll take an act of god to get rid of me&quot; to paraphrase the recruiter. They want thugs who have no problems grinding citizens. Even the good ones left are so jaded from seeing the worst humanity has to offer both on the street and in their heirarchy they stop caring or quit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I just read all of the articles pertaining to the shooting. My deepest and sincerest prayers go out toyou and your family for your loss.</p>

<p>My questions are, did he indeed have a gun and if so, was it legal? Could he have, upon being woken up panicked and pulled the gun? Is it a bad neighborhood?</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting really fucking tired of scumbag cops killing innocent people and being rewarded with paid vacations.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not calling for this or encouraging it, but how much longer until people start hunting cops? I mean, the American people can only take so much of this brutality.</p>

<p>Peace and tranquility, brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My condolences. They say we live in a classless society, but the police are part of a class that can do whatever they want with impunity. And it&#39;s going to get worse before it gets better. The militarization of the police has been a noticeable trend, corresponding to the development of counter-insurgence institutions like the DHS and NORTHCOM and domestic surveillance and data mining. Those who once swore to serve and protect have been trained to think of themselves as occupiers surrounded by insurgents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS. People, wake up. We live in a time, for the first time in American history, we have a PORUS who has not only endorsed indefinite detention for all Americans(the only similar thing is Japanese internment camps back in the day), but has asserted the right to assassinate US citizens without charge or trial as he did with al-alawi(sp) and in a separate drone strike, murdered his 16 year old son(also an American citizen). The police have been militarized. The hammer is about to fall. So, situations like what gapped to the OP&#39;s cousin will increase. I mean, gun control my ass. Every law-abiding citizen should carry. You got as much chance of being smoked by a cop as you do a criminal these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, gun death statistics are a red herring. If people truly care chiefly about being safe and secure they should ban alcohol. Alcohol kills over 6 times more people per year than gun murders. Banning alcohol, however, would be ridiculous. And so, in my mind, is gun control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not just an American thing. </p>

<p>Here in Quebec, back in 1995, my cousin was found dead in her car and had spent 6 months underwater...</p>

<p>She had a thing for cops (if you see what i mean (she was 18)). All of a sudden, one night, she is seen in her car with a police officer that she had a &quot;relationship&quot; with just across the street of the body of water she was found in 6 months later.</p>

<p>Serious clues pointed to that officer for a murder... How did it all end ? The officer in questions gets suspended 2 weeks WITH salary and the case gets put to rest, no more work is done on the case.</p>

<p>As much as the Police can be the good guys, they can also be the bad guys... and when they are, it gets pretty fucking ugly.</p>

<p>But I do feel like, the poor guy was likely wakened by shouting and knocking on his window, groggy, a flashlight blinding him, by two cops who see a gun inside the car. There are just so many unfortunate ways that situation can go negatively for the poor young kid. </p>

<p>Not justification, but, I&#39;m not sure it makes the cops brutal murderers either.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for your loss. I wouldn&#39;t comment on it so blatantly but, you put it out there for discussion, and I&#39;d easily change my mind if some evidence comes to light. Unfortunately, the defense don&#39;t even seem to be contesting the story, all I can find is that a couple extra shots, seventeen seconds later, is brutality. Which I agree with.. But I mean... It doesn&#39;t discredit anything in the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed a disturbing trend where I live, officers seem to have the ability here to erase certain portions of their car&#39;s video. It really hasn&#39;t happened lately mostly because it was causing an uproar. For quite a stretch I would say three years or so. It would take weeks for the video to be released then when it was made public, mysteriously the portion of the video that was relevant to the plaintiffs case would be gone. They threatened to make the officers video unit tamper proof. Suddenly these abuses stopped to a degree. Not going ahead and doing that is erroneous IMO. It benefits no one but that unethical cops out there who would abuse citizens. In op&#39;s case it really looks like there seemed to be a pattern going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on, now. This story was corroborated with eye witness reports and the attorney handling the case has come forward stating that there is actual video footage (that the police do not deny exists) of the incident shortly after it occurred. Please inform me of any &quot;crisis actors&quot; involved in this case. The police admit that the footage exists, but won&#39;t release it... because it&#39;s part of an open case. Come on, now. They won&#39;t even let my aunt SEE HER DEAD SON!</p>

<p>In Sandy Hook, there is nothing, NOTHING, except a void that is being filled in by people trying to get an accurate picture of what actually occurred, which is something that I think we all are entitled to, since it&#39;s being forced upon us so aggressively by the media. And then, they won&#39;t even actually address all the discrepancies regarding the case! Oh, I wish they would make this case as big as Sandy hook. It&#39;s not nearly as big and there&#39;s no way they would be able to maintain their version of the story. </p>

I don&#39;t have to sit up at night and keep watch over the door he used to come in and see that he don&#39;t come in no more. I&#39;m apart from that, but he&#39;s my family, and so while I have a part in that, I&#39;m still capable of sitting here and absorbing all your bull shit that you bring into the community, without even having to think about it, because it&#39;s just that.

    <div class="md"><p>Before we had local police forces, the citizens policed themselves.  I think if certain police departments and courtrooms continue to brutalize the citizens they were sworn to protect, then its only a matter of time before those citizens take up arms, make a stand, and defend themselves.  Once that happens in the first location, you&#39;re going to see a whole lot more incidents popping up rapidly -- nobody wants to be &#39;first&#39;, but everyone is willing to be a copycat.  If/when that happens, it will quickly become apparent which police forces have been taking advantage of their citizens, and the government will either have to step in and take down the citizens who are revolting, or be forced to admit that there is a problem with many police agencies which they have been purposefully ignoring.</p>
