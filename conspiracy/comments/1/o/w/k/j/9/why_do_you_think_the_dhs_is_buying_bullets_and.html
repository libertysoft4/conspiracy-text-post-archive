    <div class="md"><p>First of all, this information wasn&#39;t just circulating in &quot;conspiracy circles&quot;, it was first published in the MSM and the Guardian. The ammunition was a purchase order that spans several years, and after being question the DHS claimed they were saving money by making the bulk purchase when prices were low.  Regarding MRAPS, they are not being &quot;purchased&quot;, they are alreadya owned by DHS.  They are being considered &quot;surplus&quot; and are being given to local law enforcement agencies through a federal program, I forget the official name but you can google it, the Guardian has reported on it.  The program is providing not just MRAPS to local police but also automatic weapons, rockets, tanks, and other military grade equipment. </p>

<p>I&#39;m calling bullshit on tanks and rockets without a source. I have tried to search but have found no source about them buying rockets and tanks. </p>

<p>I believe the automatic weapons, but that is partly due to police agencies already having access to full auto weapons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the bullets were a purchase order, you can look at the exact purchase order itself, i&#39;ll take that over some fear mongering conspiracy bloggers word. (Not saying that is what you are, i&#39;m referring to the people that spread those false claims and numbers).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with you on the surplus program, I agree that they have been giving over MRAP&#39;s for free, my college has one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you mean when you said TANKS are not a part of the 1033 program?  You are completely wrong about that, there is clear evidence that some police precincts have in fact received tanks through this program.  Remember the black &quot;SWAT&quot; tanks that were rolled out during the Boston Bombing?<br/>
So let me get this straight, first you try to debunk the claim that MRAPS and other military equipment is being re-allocated to local police forces, you then deny that its happening, but when I provided you with an article that proves the complete opposite, you back track and say, &quot;oh theyve been doing that since the 80s&quot;.

<p>I have searched multiple times and have come up with nothing about police dept&#39;s receiving TANKS.</p>

<p>I never denied that MRAPS are going to police forces, I said I agreed with you on that, because my college received one itself. I said that previously, there were rumors floating around Conspiracy circles, that the DHS was buying 2600 MRAPS. I said that was false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said ROCKET LAUNCHERS, not GRENADE LAUNCHERS, there is a very big difference. Police can already use GRENADES, they have never had access to ROCKETS.</p>

<p>The &quot;TANK&quot;, which was supposedly given to one single Police Agency turned out not to be a TANK after I researched in to it. Just because an article says something does not mean it&#39;s true, which is why I did look in to the TANK claim. The guardian also falsely picked up the 1.6 billion round bullshit story at one time. That did not make it true. </p>
