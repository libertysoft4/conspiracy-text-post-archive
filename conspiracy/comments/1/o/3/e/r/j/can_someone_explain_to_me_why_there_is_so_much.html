I love it. I find myself spending 2-3 hours a day now reading everything you guys post. The one thing I don&#39;t understand, though, is why there is so much negativity towards the Jewish community.

I can&#39;t really summarize the Zionist movement, you just have to dig around here before you lose the &quot;<em>omigawd, they&#39;re all racists!</em>&quot; reaction, and start getting the hairs raised on the back of your neck when you realize how deep &amp; ancient these Zionist connections are...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That actually makes a lot of sense, thanks. Jihadist is such a broad term though, I wouldn&#39;t count the people taking up arms against the States, since the invasion, Jihadist. More so freedom fighters (though mainstream media would never report that). Do you know of any books or sites where I can get an overview of the Zionist movement? I&#39;ve heard that term thrown around a lot, too, and never understood it either. </p>

<p>He is most definitely not a racist.</p>

<p>watch his new film: <a href="http://youtu.be/-N3TJXTtE4g">Decades of Deception</a> and check out his film about 9/11 and the mossad connections: <a href="http://youtu.be/UoB80Yk9NYg">War by deception</a></p>

<p>Whether or not someone is wiling to speak out on Israel is to some extent a litmus test as to the validity of their information.</p>

<p>Israel has by far the most advanced civilian intelligence apparatus, this is where the whole &quot;Joos control the media&quot; meme comes from.</p>

<p>If someone is capable of speaking out against israel, you can give them a modicum of credit on other topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the major problem is Zionists and that is the main thing to focus on but also that Jews can be problematic as well.  Jews are extremely into their victimhood and they tend to muddy a lot of waters which stops this whole Zionist situation from being cleaned up.  Some people think that Zionists are only a problem and when people say Jews are a problem that they actually mean Zionists (unless they are Jew hating racists).  Well I understand the differences between the two and that there are problems with both overlapping groups.  I don&#39;t think that every Jew is a problem but that as a whole they have enjoyed entirely too much cover for all of the bullshit that they pull from the trivial to the serious because of the whole Zionist routine.  I think that the two are quite a bit interlinked in the Jewish community.  Also Jews have been completely over represented in Hollywood and media, which means that even if they all have benign interests - their viewpoint is drowning out other viewpoints.  I think that quite a number of Jews don&#39;t really mind their viewpoint having a huge audience, and I don&#39;t blame them for that part but it has created problems.  As an excercise try to find a Jew who thinks that the Jewish story is overrepresented in society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure as a jewish man, I&#39;d love to...here&#39;s the problem, everything you know about history is a lie...lies parroted by your teachers, parents, tv, authority, all of it, bullshit....winners write history...the current remnants of &quot;jew&quot; hatred are ideologies instilled from the ww2 era. The most important thing to understand in this situation is that there is a system of control that exist on this planet, that control comes in the form of controlling the &quot;scam&quot; that central banking is, or in simple terms set up a false authority {government} and then no matter what, make sure your company is the ones that supply that country with its currency/money...It is a fact that the central bankers that are in charge of the world are Jewish primariliy, not all but most. The gangsters specialize in mental manipulations and rely of the fall guy tactic for maintaining control, they never play &quot;leader&quot; or guy in charge, even if they are, they always will hire people to fill that role, that way, they remain safe and hidden. And in a way the modern &quot;we hate the jews&quot; is a perfectly crafted plan by this certain subsection of Jew gangsters, who have been running this same scam forever. WW2 was used as a cementing of this ideology in the minds of people and has bought these zionist central banker jews time, it has done so by basically using the entire jewsish race as a decoy, human shield. By creating a &quot;don&#39;t say bad things about the jews&quot; environment, we create a scenario where regular jews will unknowing stand up and defend the central banker Zionist jews. This is very intentional. As a Jew I find myself in a juxtaposed love hate affair with Hitler. For you see there is very much a reason he has been demonized, that is because he is the one person that came the closest to shutting down the Jewish Zionist central banking families. Unfortunately in order to rally the troops of the times, it was needed to lump all Jews in the same category, and Jews back then like now, were used by the Rothschilds, Loeb, Kuhn, Cohens, Oppenhiemers ,Schiffs and all the other owners of the central banks as decoys. Basically Hitler had the 100% right idea to round up and exterminate these central bankers/masters of usury, but had the wrong method by lumping all Jews into the same category...There are many untruths about the &quot;holocaust&quot; ...for example, I have descendants who were in camps, but they did not die from being gassed or stuffed in ovens, the died trying to escape or starved. Both not fun ways to go, but big difference between being stuffed in an oven and dying of starvation because you are the last in order of importance to be fed....</p>

<p>The central banker Zionist have a new major problem that they did not have even just 10 years ago, it is the largest threat they will have faced since Hitler, that is that Jews, such as myself, who are just normal &quot;dudes&quot; now understand why we have been held up to be hated by these scumbag criminals, we understand now that we have been used by these bankers, and now, they are fucked, because frankly more and more Jewish people are defining the difference between &quot;jew and zionist jew&quot;....</p>

<p>and just incase you wonder whats all the fuss about with these central banks, they have no money, yet get to create it for &quot;governments&quot; governments &quot;borrow&quot; air {typed digits}, then you get to work your ass off and pay interest in the form of income tax to these central bankers...They do nothing, you bust your ass, they get rich off of you, you stay poor....it is what ww2 was about....Trust me, hell hath no fury like a bunch of hopping mad jews who have been fucked over by their own race. You go to places where jews are and you hear one thing lately....&quot;what are we going to do about this Rothschild thing?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you say about the central bankers. But that doesn&#39;t go far enough to cover the problem.</p>

<p>Jews control the media, and for almost a century the media has been spewing out propaganda designed to undermine white Christian culture. As a Jew you may not find this objectionable, but as a white Christian, I do. Jews are 2% of the US population, and yet they are permitted to corrupt and undermine white Christian culture, simply because they -- the Jews -- don&#39;t agree with it? Well, they don&#39;t get a say. White Christian culture was created by white Christians, for white Christians. Whether the Jews like it or not should be irrelevent. It is not irrelevent because we have allowed Jews to seize so much wealth and power. Far, far too much wealth and power.</p>

<p>Jews have been so successful in corrupting white Christian culture, that over a period of decades they have succeeded in turning a large percentage of white Christians against it. They have disseminated pornography through our culture, they have attacked and mocked and reviled our religion, they have undermined the quality of our schools, but the most pernicious part of this campaign to destroy the white race -- and that&#39;s what it is, ultimately -- has been to brainwash white Christians into hating themselves, hating their skin color, hating their own heritage, hating their own culture, hating their own religion.</p>

<p>You know, it was Jews who created the communist revolution, which resulted in the misery and deaths of untold millions in the Soviet Union and other countries. That movement collapsed and failed, but not before the damage was done. Now Jews in the West have undertaken another revolution, very similar to the communist revolution, that has as its ultimate goal the genocide of the white race, and the emasculation of the Christian religion. In the end that may fail as well, but not before millions suffer and die.</p>

<p>And yet Jews wonder why white Christians have anything against them. You -- your tribe -- is trying to <em>kill us</em>. We have every right to act against you with as much force as is necessary to prevent this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the NWO is the corporate conglomerate, &quot;central banking&quot; is a generic term that encompasses all that &quot;it&quot; is, which is very much the control of media. To use it as propaganda and to spread moral corruption and filth, to manipulate the thought process, this is the way of the central banker. I have no defense against what you state, there are many Jews who are in the gang, the gang encompasses many different categories, health care{insurance scam} media {propaganda/filth/corruption of youth} pharma {the drug lords} and any other division that lays down the law on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the insight as a Jewish man. I would suggest that they aren&#39;t &#39;your own race&#39;.. Which is the final epiphany. They use real Jews for a reason. Because they hate them the most. That is the big conspiracy. It is ancient and it has to do with the whole &#39;choosen people&#39; thing. Imagine if the highest order of Zionists aren&#39;t even Jewish! They aren&#39;t. So because of that no real Jew can be a real Zionist. They can only be misled away from who they really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ancient history of this civilization, the story of it&#39;s creation and it&#39;s end has many actors. Each must play his part. Goodness is a foundational characteristic we can all hope is playing us. But it&#39;s not misleading to point out the significance of the Jewish people when discussing the drama and how it must unfold. It&#39;s not suprising that we find the Jewish emancipation and glorification being mocked with a concentration camp named Israel. The bizarro promised land. Created and lead by demons pretending to be Jews under the guise of Zionism. I am not Jewish.. Or religious. I believe in the story of our civilization because it&#39;s accuracy. There IS actual hatred of Jewish people. The devil hates humanity and he has a thing with drama and God&#39;s people.. His work is obvious and literal in the place where he got his name. Just look at what Israel is compared to what was promised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>really the much more appropriate term is &quot;central banker&quot; that&#39;s what the real problem is, central banking, money printed as debt, usury...by definig a crime in the context of a racial thing, we, with great intent, get &quot;confused&quot;...please keep in mind, Jews may run the show, but there are plenty of lap dog goy who fill the roles as &quot;leaders&quot; for these criminals...Those who know who and what they work for, they like others, do it for all that money can buy....</p>

<p>More importantly in this situation is understanding that YOU! whoever  or whatever you are, are really the &quot;problem&quot;....what I mean by this is that once you understand the money as debt scam, you understand that all it is really about is having faith in the currency, the brainwash is that &quot;government&quot; is in charge of the creation of money, they are not as we all know now....so what this means is that a bunch of criminals have laid out a scam for you to &quot;believe&quot; in, and by participating in and having faith in the scam/money, you are the ones who put your own noose around your own neck....It is only because you believe in and use their currency that you are a slave to them...</p>

<p>So obviously the key is to get everyone to understand what the problem is so collectively you can tell them to fuck off by simply not using their money anymore...</p>

<p>unfortunately they have planned for this contingency and are now co-opting bitcoin to make it seem like the alternate currency to jump to....and they will probably win, based on what I am seeing, the assimilation process is going smoothly </p>

<p>until you have a nationalized movement to have honest transparent monetary systems that are mentally{have faith, know is honest} backed by the people, you will have systems that are subject to &quot;them&quot; getting to the inside</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me start off by saying, I agree with your over all message, that being said...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately in order to rally the troops of the times, it was needed to lump all Jews in the same category, and Jews back then like now, were used by the Rothschilds, Loeb, Kuhn, Cohens, Oppenhiemers ,Schiffs and all the other owners of the central banks as decoys. Basically Hitler had the 100% right idea to round up and exterminate these central bankers/masters of usury, but had the wrong method by lumping all Jews into the same category...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Hitler didn&#39;t lump all Jews together, there would have been Jew-led covert operations happening within Germany on a daily basis during the war; disrupting the war effort, destabilizing the country, Hitler had the foresight to see that connection within the Jewish people and decided that it was best for Germany to put all Jews into camps/out of the country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By creating a &quot;don&#39;t say bad things about the jews&quot; environment, we create a scenario where regular jews will unknowing stand up and defend the central banker Zionist jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except this mentality of standing up, protecting and defending the central banker Zionist Jews was alive and well within the psyche of Jews before World War 2. I have an inclination to think that they would even be proud of their Jew brothers doing so well in a foreign country, manipulating the system, using the goyim.</p>

<p>Like you said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trust me, hell hath no fury like a bunch of hopping mad jews who have been fucked over by their own race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But who gives a shit about those White people, right?</p>

<p>That is partly why you detect animosity towards Jewish people. You choose to categorize yourself as separate from everyone else and then you act insulted, surprised and guilty when it benefits you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give a shit about all people and all life. I identify myself as Jewish by my heritage as you identify your self as white, as we both should, for that is the truth about who we are. Some may act insulted, supprised or guilty, I do not. What I do know is that PEOPLE who are divided by the Jewish gangsters and their White yes-men will fail to rise up against the evil. As when it comes down to it, that is what we are dealing with. Evil. We must have faith in ourselves that we all want the same thing in order to trust one another, we must have hope for a better future by working together against this evil as a team, and we must have love for one another in order for light to triumph over the darkness.</p>

<p>edit; Hitler was doomed from the start as by that time the central bankers had been well entrenched in America and already had control of the dollar. It was predetermined that America would enter the war before they did. All part of the plan. And the second that was on the table, was the second Hitler was already defeated, as well as Japan riding on their coat tails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this may be true, I would assert that should the Zionist regime falter, many other religious oligarchies from different parts of the planet would be leaping at the chance for world domination. When we describe the sickness that is currently robbing this world of its spiritual and physical wealth, we must make it very clear that this is a sickness that stems from the innate condition of being human, and not one single set of religious doctrines. The Zionist regime is just the capstone of our current societal pyramid structure, and when it falls, others will rise to assume its position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well seeing how no one has more money than the source of all money, it&#39;s easy to buy out desperate people to work for you...&quot;I got bills to pay&quot;...very few people have the moral fiber to have a choice between eating and starving and choosing starving because it&#39;s the right thing to do...</p>

<p>I have been on every internet forum since they have been, I have spoke the truth where ever I go...</p>

<p>I tell you now, I feel myself to have a moral fiber that most men could not grasp, I say this because I was one of them, trained to take over the helm, I walked away from my inheritance, which is all of you, in order to stand shoulder to shoulder with you...</p>

<p>I am Jewish, I am a carpenter/wood carver and I am the son of a demon, for you see there are several families beside the poster boy Rothschilds who run the central banker racket, I come from one of these families, my father is Satan, he is pure distilled evil in a bottle and I have sworn to destroy him.</p>

<p>An angel who has fallen upwards from hell to the earth. It is said that Jesus, the Christ, was the son of god, sent to save you. I would say to you and others that I am the son of a devil and I have been sent here to save you.</p>

<p>Please do not take the religious connotations literally, I am a Christian moralist {do the right } thing, but worship no diety...But I do find the storyline, as it relates to me, as &quot;interesting&quot;</p>

<p>Personally I feel there is no one who has a better chance of saving you than I, delusional or not, I am an insider, I know ALL of the tricks, I know how they think and the tactics they use, I feel that I am well spoken, and I know how to teach people the truth about the facts. Beyond that, I feel it my personal duty to right the wrongs that the gang to which I once belonged to have inflicted on you, so much so, that I would willingly lay down my life for you or anyone. to fight the evil and expose the truth and to die doing so is the very least I can do.</p>

<p>Your sin and everyone around you is that you have faith in this &quot;money&quot;. I will die for your sin and try to absolve you.</p>

The reason they do this is because zionists exist within, and use judaism as a &#39;human shield&#39; to deflect attention from their evil machinations.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one asking us to differentiate and stop being racist and this guy has just done it yet you&#39;re still dissatisfied. What exactly do you want? It seems you just don&#39;t want any kind of discussion at all with regards to anything to do with Israel.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll make my position to you quite clear. I don&#39;t hate Jews, I have no reason to include entire peoples because of the actions of a few maniacs. It&#39;s the same way I wouldn&#39;t call all Muslims suicide bombers because it simply makes no sense. If someone is a Jew and they do horrible things, it deserves to be pointed out. It&#39;s not being pointed out because they are a Jew, it&#39;s because of their actions. And from that you can differentiate between hating Jews and what some individuals are guilty of.</p>

<p>The reason Israel is such a hot topic is because we know in the past and now it has a huge influence on American foreign policy. That needs to be discussed because things are being done on behalf of Israel that has a grave cost for the US in many different ways and the people don&#39;t get a say on those actions. Replace the &#39;Jewish lobbies&#39; with &#39;Muslim lobbies&#39; and there would be a massive uproar from the American people because what they are enabling. And it isn&#39;t just conspiracy theorists that talk about how powerful these lobbies are.</p>

<p>These are mainstream news and even Jewish news reports about how AIPAC (Israeli lobby) were pushing America to bomb Syria. Nobody in the US wanted the government to bomb Syria so an outside country pushing hard for it doesn&#39;t seem like something I can vote on and it&#39;s subverting my democracy because i don&#39;t want it or I can&#39;t vote on it.</p>

<p>When you look at US wars in the Middle East, the biggest beneficiary is Israel as they&#39;ve stated on the record they want the wars but they don&#39;t do it themselves - they lobby another country to send their troops, use their money and take the criticism worldwide for a horrible war. And on top of that, the reasons for the war are not revealed in a meaningful way. You have to dig around yourself to get a historically accurate depiction of what really happened instead of shit you hear on the news. It wasn&#39;t Bush&#39;s war, it was Israel&#39;s war and they got their sympathisers elected into the Bush Administration to make sure it went ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The army is openly controlled by the Zionists right? It&#39;s not even questionable. They are the one&#39;s who created this modern Israel. Forcing children to populate their army. </p>

<p>During the Nazi reign humanity still existed inside the camps. Love was shared, laughter, REAL humanity, REAL strength and joy and comradery was expressed and shared among the Jews trapped in that hell. How could this happen inside these prisons? I find it interesting that the characteristics you point out as signifying freedom are about protection and guns. You can travel, you can cross the physical borders but you cannot escape into real freedom unless you can acknowledge that what has been created is a very poor implementation of the promised land. The people who created Israel have stolen and hijacked what it could, should and WILL actually be. Building walls, instilling fear, insisting &quot;Might is RIGHT!&quot;.. all lies that cloud the truth. Who decided that segregation was REQUIRED? Isn&#39;t that exactly what a concentration camp is?</p>

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) gives the meaning as: &quot;The action of &#39;interning&#39;; confinement within the limits of a country or place.&quot; </p>

<p>You know that Jews have lived in the land of Israel for thousands of years. Free to travel to other countries. Throughout history Jews have been oppressed and modern day Israel is just another example of that oppression. It&#39;s the most sinister expression of that oppression yet. Turning many Jews into their own captors and oppressors. You can blame everyone in the world for what Israel is. But really you need only look to the Zionists who will be NOWHERE NEAR Israel when the real war begins. THEY are the one&#39;s who travel freely because they wouldn&#39;t dare make Israel their actual home.</p>

<p>People like <a href="http://thepeacefactory.org/israel-loves-palestine/">http://thepeacefactory.org/israel-loves-palestine/</a> are the one&#39;s living freely in Israel. Peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, you are most correct. Israel <strong>is</strong> a &quot;concentration camp&quot;. Nearly half of the world&#39;s (known) Jews are there - surrounded on all sides by peoples that the Zionists have worked HARD to make into bitter enemies. </p>

<p>&quot;Existential threat&quot; is a part of daily life - and this is no accident: Were it not for the perpetual threat from exterior &quot;enemies&quot;, real or imaginary, Jews would cease to be cohesive, and might tend to ASSIMILATE.</p>

<p>As I mentioned previously, assimilation is THE greatest threat to Judaism. Should this threat fade in the minds of Jews, the hard-core zealots will do whatever is necessary to keep the fire of fear burning in the forefronts of the minds of their brethren.</p>

<p>Cohesion and unity of purpose is the backbone that has held the Jews together <em>as a people</em> through 2,000 years of Diaspora. It is their strength - this is why they reenforce it among their ranks, and work to DESTROY unity in those they wish to subdue.</p>

<p>&quot;Diversity is our strength&quot;?</p>

<p>christian zionists are worrysome to me only because of their misplaced beliefs, and their seeming conviction.   I agree there are some fanatics that believe israel must be there for their messiah to return.   of course, I would think some enterprising jews are aware of this too and find them easy marks.</p>

<p>the biggest jewish conspiracy I can conceive involves a few preserving their faith by convincing the Romans to concoct Christianity thereby protecting their own cannon from being wiped out completely.</p>

<p>Sorry, I thought that by saying &quot;<em>Most of the Jews that were present in Palestine when the Zionist State was founded</em>&quot; I had made the timeline quite clear.</p>

<p>Otherwise we may as well be talking about the number of Stegosaurus that were present in the area that is now called Louisiana back in the time of Pangaea.  </p>

<p>As to &quot;<em>christian zionists</em>&quot;, they are seen by Jewish Zionists as &quot;useful idiots&quot; who&#39;s passion and efforts can be directed to serve the interests of Zionism - and Zionists fund and promote &quot;Christian&quot; leaders who in turn serve Zionist ends.</p>

<p>Tools.</p>

<p>It goes both ways, lets then talk about the present situation.  </p>

<p>what I&#39;m trying to say is that there have been jewish conspiracies. </p>

<p>one example I think is some of them collaborated in creating the jesus myth, as a way of preserving their writings from the romans after romans pretty much wiped out judaism.  palestine was roman..the holy roman empire still exists, and it dominates more than you hear on r/conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why have Jews been regarded with suspicion and shunned throughout history? Do you think it&#39;s because people woke up one morning and said to themselves, &quot;What am I going to do today? I know -- I&#39;ll hate the Jews!&quot;</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t work that way. When something or someone is hated by millions in different nations over a period of more than a thousand years, it&#39;s because they did something for which to be hated. This is elementary, and shouldn&#39;t even need to be said, but Jewish propaganda had obscured this obvious point.</p>

<p>Jews have presented themselves as innocent victims of evil white people. They have put forth this fiction for centuries, and are still putting it forth, even though they are the wealthiest and most powerful ethnic group in the world.</p>

<p>So, ingenuous person (who I am sure has no connection with the JIDF or any other Zionist advocacy organization), ask not why there are things said against the Jews in this subreddit -- ask why there were things said against the Jews for the past thousand years in dozens of different countries by tens of millions of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give a shit about all people and all life. I identify myself as Jewish by my heritage as you identify your self as white, as we both should, for that is the truth about who we are. Some may act insulted, supprised or guilty, I do not. What I do know is that PEOPLE who are divided by the Jewish gangsters and their White yes-men will fail to rise up against the evil. As when it comes down to it, that is what we are dealing with. Evil. We must have faith in ourselves that we all want the same thing in order to trust one another, we must have hope for a better future by working together against this evil as a team, and we must have love for one another in order for light to triumph over the darkness.</p>

<p>edit; Hitler was doomed from the start as by that time the central bankers had been well entrenched in America and already had control of the dollar. It was predetermined that America would enter the war before they did. All part of the plan. And the second that was on the table, was the second Hitler was already defeated, as well as Japan riding on their coat tails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ancient history of this civilization, the story of it&#39;s creation and it&#39;s end has many actors. Each must play his part. Goodness is a foundational characteristic we can all hope is playing us. But it&#39;s not misleading to point out the significance of the Jewish people when discussing the drama and how it must unfold. It&#39;s not suprising that we find the Jewish emancipation and glorification being mocked with a concentration camp named Israel. The bizarro promised land. Created and lead by demons pretending to be Jews under the guise of Zionism. I am not Jewish.. Or religious. I believe in the story of our civilization because it&#39;s accuracy. There IS actual hatred of Jewish people. The devil hates humanity and he has a thing with drama and God&#39;s people.. His work is obvious and literal in the place where he got his name. Just look at what Israel is compared to what was promised.</p>
