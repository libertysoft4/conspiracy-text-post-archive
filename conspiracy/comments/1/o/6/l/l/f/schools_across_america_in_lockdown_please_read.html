I can&#39;t be the only one noticing this, right?

<p>Also below is my post from a couple of days ago describing the same pattern. Please reply and tell me I&#39;m not crazy for thinking this is extremely concerning??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think about it, there are alot of schools in america. Lockdowns are ordered all the time for reasons such as cops chasing any criminals in a 2  mile radius from the school, wild animals, medical emergencies, police sweeps and raids around the area, things like that. all of these add up in a day but in reality, it is probably only a small percentage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>rapid change in subject but i&#39;ll see your instigation and raise you some illumination. it is not my beleif, as you imply, that a cabal of wicked men within the US government plot to oppress our own citizens. On the contrary i think our form of government, specifically the ideal of consent of the governed with a well armed and well informed constituency, has been the only thing that ever frightened cabals of wicked men. i do beleive we are witnessing a corruption of that government. it manifests as a convergence of self interest, a collective fear, and a fifth column of apathy and discontent if not actual forign influence. i beleive that often the convergence of self interest takes on some jungian collective consious attributes and gives the appearance of some shadowy hand pulling the strings. I beleive heavy handed wealth has abused usery systems to devistate and fleece the most prosperous economy in recorded history and i also beleive that the heavy handed money represents an ideal of devine right to rule. I think this is the question we have watched played out since the signing of the magna carta maybe even longer than that. I also beleive there are many who, like you,  know how to use logic but refuse to use their five senses so their logic falls short like shadows in a cave chained by cognitive dissonance. I also belive, contrary to your accusation that i am a fear mongerer, that fear is my enemy and perhaps the only enemy. Fear is the only thing stopping all of us from living together in wealth and abundance. I hope we can move beyond it, i certainly intend to. ultimately this is why i argued with your dismissal of lockdowns in the first place, they do not improve safety or security they induce fear and accomplish little else. if my implication of your foolishness offended i am sorry for the offense, we have a lot of people on this sub  who shill/troll and sometimes the insults fly too quickly. I did not mean it as a personal attack but i do stand by the position that defense of or complacancy towards fearmongering tactics like school lockdowns is work for shills and fools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My main concern with these lockdowns is the consistency in which they&#39;ve been happening for the last couple of days, and the reasons that each one is concerning. If you&#39;ll notice while reading them that its a &quot;credible&quot; call in that alerted authorities to a man dressed in all black, or sometimes jeans and a t-shirt, that may have walked onto campus with a gun or weapon. This can&#39;t be normal, not the frequency this has been going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds to me like they&#39;re trying to get us used to not only the word &quot;lockdown&quot;, but also to the act of being &quot;locked down&quot;.

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1nqume/use_of_the_word_lockdown/">Someone brought this up a week ago in another post</a>. I believe it&#39;s being used to induce fear, much like how the word &quot;terrorism&quot; was used after 9/11.</p>

<p>You simply cannot watch everything all of the time.</p>

<p>For instance, if the schools are locked down what happens if the school is attacked, not with guns but with fire or gas?</p>
