I never bring up reality to people who don&#39;t want to know anymore, but I&#39;m sincerley shocked at the number of people who don&#39;t think Gulf War Syndrome is real, and don&#39;t believe DU is seriously toxic to people and the areas we&#39;ve used it in. </p>

<p>Is there some hit-piece by the MSM that whitewashed the issue? There&#39;s plenty of documented evidence in our own ground troops that a dog could tell was hazardous. Does anyone have a link to disinformation or an explanation to why a smart person wouldn&#39;t realize how deadly this stuff is, not to mention all the kids born with horrible problems because of it being used?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all in the wording of the chemical weapons bans written up during the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Intent of use is a very big part of this.  Since the primary intent of using Depleted Uranium is not for the toxins to kill the enemy, it is allowed.  The chemicals that are banned are munitions that are designed with the <em>specific intent</em> to cause death or harm through their toxic properties or toxic chemicals and their precursors.  The poisonous effects of DU are viewed as a side-effect of the primary intent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely correct.</p>

<p>DU is a &quot;soft-kill&quot; weapon.</p>

<p>It may not kill immediately (except for the tanks/crews that a DU round impacts) but it&#39;s dangers last for years and years--killing through radiation that lasts centuries and particles that are stirred up with every puff of dust.</p>

<p>And remember...ONE particle of this crap in your lungs and YOU ARE GETTING CANCER. End of story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article talks about crops that have been engineered to be resistant to 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. It also states implicitly that these crops aren&#39;t in use and haven&#39;t been approved for use.</p>

<p>It then switches gears to talking about glyphosate-resistant GMO crops and hopes you won&#39;t notice the switcheroo. Glyphosate-resistant GMO are the so-called &quot;roundup-ready&quot; crops and while they have their own health concerns, they aren&#39;t even slightly related to 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or, by extension, agent orange, and therefore nothing in this article supports your claim that 90% of produce contains a &quot;friendly derivative&quot; of agent orange (presumably 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>90% of produce has GMOs. Maybe that&#39;s why I put the two together. They aren&#39;t causational. So sure, my statistic is off slightly.</p>

<p>But, at the end of the day, there are research studies suggesting that conventional, by way of these Monsanto pesticides, cause malfunction and cancerous growth in your endocrine system. Ill link the study if ya want.</p>

<p>But again, if you think I&#39;m bullshitting feel free to look more up about Monsanto and their practices. You&#39;ll have to get private info tho, Monsanto doesn&#39;t publicly release anything concerning their practices. They say on their website that they won&#39;t because they are just gangster. Just like how they buy off the USDA or even go work for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because our nuclear power plants create this byproduct which is then used as munitions to irradiate entire theaters of war for thousands of years to come.  To know that, where ever our troops stomp, we leave a wake of destruction behind, is too much for the normal everyday person to comprehend... although they should.</p>

<p>The alternative to using uranium, is thorium ~ it is far more efficient but does not yield the munitions our military industrial complex desires.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s one of those, too shocking to be true facets.. no one wants to admit that 19% of their income tax is being used to fashion radioactive munitions and injecting them into the people, land, air and seas of other nations.  Many doctors in the &#39;conquered&#39; sandbox advise women of not getting pregnant now as most children (a staggering statistic) are not coming to term properly (disfigured, mutated etc). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the alternative to using DU for armor-piercing is tungsten. However, tungsten is far more costly to produce and they already have all this DU lying around anyway. So instead of having to pay to store radioactive waste they can just load it into munitions and it gets dumped halfway across the globe.

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few articles out there, but nothing by the MSM really. That would be a real heresy to say the least. The stuff is fucking lethal, ergo you are not going to hear a lot about it, just like the old Agent Orange.</p>

<p>The &quot;good guys&quot; would never use a weapon that would last a few thousand years and leave behind radiation far worse than Hiroshima or Nagasaki, would they? And lets face it &quot;depleted&quot; means empty and without energy...</p>

<p>The munitions also solves a lot of problems, the waste uranium can be disposed of overseas saving on storage costs, it is very, very effective and really, if a trooper gets a dose he or she can die a bit quicker and stop collecting all those veteran benefits also.  The enemy will also lose their next few (dozens) of generations of children and with increased health costs of helping the maimed, they will also need to spend more on medical care. Also any military that dares to fight knows that generations will suffer... a beautiful weapon really. </p>

<p>The MSM is not going to cover this as it really is such bad press, think about how long and how hard it was for Agent Orange to get any press and does it really get any traction these days anyways? No, not really... same with DU. Its so horrible its best to bury the damn news on it and talk about the latest video star drama.</p>

<p>Also if it did get traction in the news and suppose it was a popular item, can you imagine the clean up costs? It would be billions of dollars at the least. So you are going to find this issue on fringe sites and a few &quot;do-gooder&quot; sites that do not matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all psychology, folks. If you hit on any BIG issue that fucks with their ideological views and self image they will always shut down.</p>

<p>I just had this conversation with my buddy last night. He finally acknowledged that he knew full well that shit was going south. But he wasn&#39;t willing to pay attention and he willfully envelopes himself in his own &quot;safety bubble&quot;.</p>

<p>We protect ourselves with this paradigm we travel in and most people don&#39;t have the &quot;tools&quot; to explore outside of it. This &quot;tool&quot; can be anything, I&#39;d imagine. It&#39;s &quot;self centric&quot;, therefore it&#39;s internally decided on. </p>

<p>In my &quot;personal&quot; life I was able to break through my self projected paradigm through multiple life events that minimized the importance of money, wealth, prosperity, and a &quot;standard 40hr/wk job&quot;. Once those factors became moot I was able to explore subjects that were dangerous to acknowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well depleted uranium is a lot more common in coating for smoothbore shells and reactive armour in main battle tanks than chemical weapons. Sure, it has been used as a weapons with intent of causing biological harm in the past, but a lot of people cant get passed with associating DU with tanks. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why it seems that people tend to underestimate DU&#39;s toxicity. I for one used to underestimate its toxicity because the word &#39;depleted&#39; before uranium gave me the impression that the uranium used in tanks were stabilized and removed from all radiation... But obviously we all make mistakes and dont do enough research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all three of these are generally accepted by the main stream media.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just they aren&#39;t talked about. I can vividly recall a piece by Jeremy Scahill on MSNBC where he talks a little about it. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s talked about on CSPAN as well</p>

<p>Many Americans think Iraq had something to do with 9/11 and we found WMD&#39;s even though most of main stream media accepts that reality. Pretty standard stuff</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m doing some research on the net right now. </p>

<p>I think the reason it falls on deaf ears is that average people know absolutely nothing about it. </p>

<p>My first assumption is that if it&#39;s depleted then it must be inert and non toxic. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in reading a full comprehensive article if you&#39;d write one. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to hear what the government says about why they use it in the first place and why it&#39;s perfectly safe.  I mean why use uranium why you can use lead? Is uranium harder and therefore more piercing?</p>

<p>Then to raise public awareness id like to hear how it must end up being a way to dump radioactive waste in other peoples backyard. Also interested in whether it still gives off radiation and what would happen if I swallowed some. </p>

<p>EDIT: maybe it&#39;s not so much that people are turned off. Maybe they haven&#39;t been taught how nasty this shit is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of articles written that are available on the internet. Most people don&#39;t want to know to much about it because it makes them uncomfortable. Try watching the second video or any of the multitude of others on DU. It&#39;s hard to watch. It gives me nightmares. The American government is guilty of war crimes for using DU and they really don&#39;t want us discussing it too much because someday they might actually be held responsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Du seems to be a way to dump waste. </p>

<p>You should research the addition of fluoride into out water systems. It&#39;s just another way to dispose of something that has no other way of being disposed of. </p>

<p>The other reason I bring up fluoride is that I began detoxifying myself from fluoride, bromine, and toxic halogens about a year ago using large doses of iodine. Initially it made me very sick. </p>

<p>You might check out the iodine forums on cure zone . Com. </p>

<p>Iodine apparently also detoxes heavy metals like mercury (from your dental fillings)
Maybe it might help with DU exposure too?</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know about fluoride. What you experienced during detox was a Herxheimer Reaction or healing crises.
The intentional poisoning of our food, water and air and the drugging of the population with fluoride based antidepressants like prozac ,hypnotics like lunesta, it becomes almost impossible to believe other than that there is a conspiracy to kill us off slowly and profit from our demise in the mean time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The SSKI I started taking has about 10-20 mg of potassium iodine per drop. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty massive dose. It made me feel -really- sick and woozy. 
I scaled it back to a half drop a day. </p>

<p>A year later I am taking about 8 drops a day which is an anti-cancer dose. </p>

<p>My head and thinking much more clear. </p>

<p>My body aches are finally subsiding and my energy levels and stress is also coming down.  </p>
