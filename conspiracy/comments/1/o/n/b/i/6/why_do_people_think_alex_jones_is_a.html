    <div class="md"><p>He does talk about Israel, if somebody twists his arm, but he gets off the subject as quickly as he can. He never talks about the Jews -- for example, he won&#39;t talk about Jewish control of the American media. I&#39;ve never heard him refer to it once. He has said that the Saudis control Hollywood, which is absurd, and that the Chinese control Hollywood, which is also absurd. But never that the Jews control Hollywood. Also, he won&#39;t talk about  Jewish control of Congress. He talks about the Rothschilds, but not the Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. He just mentioned his wife was Christian 2 days ago on his show. Another time I heard him ranting about the &quot;globalists&quot; and he seemed to tie in Israel with that group, saying something pro-Palestine, but then he gave some statement like, &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing against Israel, but... &quot; I thought it seemed as if he accidentally got too specific.

    <div class="md"><p>No need to be a dick.  I just can&#39;t picture Alex Jones being controlled.  he mostly covers stuff that is entirety blacked out by msm.  He is constantly on the side of vets and oath keepers.  He calls out the cops.  He doesn&#39;t blame everything on Israel every day bfd. But he does call them out periodically.  and he calls out the Jew bankers every day.  He just skips generalizing them as jews.  And to your link, the swiss are not anti interventional.  the swiss financed Hitler, the swiss flag was on the panthers during the invasion of Poland.  All the German reparation money still flows thru Switzerlands bank of international settlements.  That bank may be the tip of the pyramid so to speak.</p>

  If you are saying that he is under constant threat so in order to fend this off he needs to keep up appearances and seem as though he is fine, you are basically saying he is the greatest actor/most deceptive person of all time... which if he is that deceptive, again, how can you believe anything he says?</p>

<p>He HAS to keep up appearances, if he just disappeared, that would give TPTB ultimate legitimacy. They can&#39;t &quot;disappear&quot; him, but his family and his paycheck are all game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See here is the problem with any disagreements people have in this sub.  It becomes &quot;you just can&#39;t understand [insert shitty point here].&quot;  I <em>get</em> what you are saying, but it doesn&#39;t make sense.  People who are in fear for their lives or the lives of their families don&#39;t hob nob with celebrities.  As far as the Piers thing goes, did I say his points were shitty?  No I said that he was screaming like a lunatic.  (However it was utterly ridiculous when he challenged Piers to a boxing match... what was the rational point he was making there?).  As far as not associating with Zionism or Jews, his wife is a Jew.  The reason he doesn&#39;t talk shit about Zionism is most likely because he doesn&#39;t want to upset/offend his wife.  And as far as &quot;disappearing&quot; him?  That would be ridiculous.  He is one of the best things that ever happened to the establishment media/government.  The majority of people who just catch of glimpse of his program or youtube a few of his clips wind up thinking he is a maniac so they throw away everything he says (even the things that are true).  I can filter his information, but can you look past your own tendencies to finding conspiracy in everything long enough to consider that maybe Alex Jones is just a guy who found a niche market full of gullible people willing to spend their money on whatever bullshit he is peddling and that&#39;s the whole basis of his show? </p>

I wish there were some more solidarity among those who would consider ourselves &quot;awake&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is a problem that I run into a lot when I debate the existence of a conspiracy or not.  People become attached to their beliefs over the evidence (or lack there of).  It&#39;s a habit that a lot of people in the conspiracy community have formed.  People tend to come up with a conclusion, and then work backwards towards trying to justify how their conclusion is right (rather than starting with the evidence and working towards a conclusion).  I get a lot of downvotes for disagreeing even when I try to do so respectfully.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Alex Jones is easy to disregard as a “conspiracy theorist”, not because of what he says, but because of how he says it. Everything is desperate and dangerous with him.&quot;</em></p>

<p>whether or not he works for Israel only history will tell, and his ideas aren&#39;t fully aligned with this subreddit. He is dangerous to anymovement with the way he acts, he is one of the reasons that people think conspiracy theorists are so &quot;wacko&quot; and probably why this page only gets 180k subscribers.</p>

<p>And for a guy(Lets just call him for what he is a MILLIONARE) who thinks the economy is going to collapse its pretty fishy of him to push his advertisements so hard(Those freakin water filters lol if the NSA is tracking your purchases why the fuck would you buy shit that makes you suspicious with a digital paper trail)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of what Alex Jones says is brilliant. It really is -- he can come out with some wonderfully insightful observations. He will say things almost nobody else has the guts to talk about -- for example, he is almost alone in criticizing the mainstream media for demonizing Constitutionalists as racists.</p>

<p>But then Jones will come out with the most absurd, childish piece of drivel and I will ask myself why I&#39;m bothering to listen to this idiot. He throws temper tantrums like a three-year old. He has some kind of Tourette&#39;s affliction that makes him repeat lists of things endlessly.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a very mixed bag of nuts, put it that way. He can be brilliant and incisive, and two minutes later he sounds like an idiot and a lunatic.</p>

<p>The reason some people think Jones is a shill for the elite is his reluctance to talk about the role of the Jews in the New World Order. Jones basically avoids criticizing the Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some examples:</p>

<p>1-) Look at some of the Russian oligarchs that became rich overnight after the fall of Soviet Union: Roman Abramovich, Mikhail Prokhorov, Vitaly Malkin, Boris Berezovsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Fridman... From the wikipedia page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarchs">russian oligarchs</a>, at least half are eligible to benefit from the Law of Return.</p>

<p>2-) Widely accepted as a fact is that the Russian/Bolshevik revolution that dethroned the Czar was headed by jews, and, while most of its members were not Jews, they were certainly overrepresented on the group. With the notable exception of Lenin, who was only a quarter Jew, most of the leading communists who took control of Russia were Jews. Trotsky, Sverdlov, Zinoviev...</p>

<p>3-)  Even less known is that Mr. Nathan Rothschild was instrumental in almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family#The_Napoleonic_Wars">single-handedly financing the British war effort against Napoleon Bonaparte, apparently</a>. It tells a lot when the largest empire the world has ever seen at the time, the British Empire at its peak, had to rely on a single man to finance its most important war effort and its greatest threat, who, again, was a Jew.</p>

<p>4-) Most of the mainstream American media is controlled by Jews, including Hollywood (media shapes the beliefs and culture of American people).</p>

<p>5-) The largest financial institutions in the world are also owned or controlled by Jews.</p>

<p>6-) The largest contributors to the presidential campaign of both candidates of US are also Jews. If you know how campaign donations work, those who gave more money get special seats on key offices of the government (such as Monsanto getting the FDA).</p>

<p>In short, the western world is controlled by people that belongs do the Jewish ethnicity. It will reduce as China and, to a lesser extent, continental Europe rises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what does he achieve?</p>

<p>Looking at this thread alone you can see that he is <strong>divisive</strong>. The only people he &quot;converts&quot; were going in that direction anyhow. His childish overthetop behavior not only scares away people but reinforces the tin foil hat conspiritard image.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t have to be, in contrast look at someone like Joe Rogan, who handles similar material but doesn&#39;t alienate (or outright insult) new viewers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is a STRATFOR employee hired for the sole purposes of spreading disinformation, making &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; look like lunatics, and to further any and all Zionist agendas.</p>

<p>He is a con, plain and simple. A &quot;honeypot&quot; if you will for the FAR less advanced &#39;conspiratards.&#39;</p>

<p>He is a slave to George Friedman--Zionist owner of STRATFOR--and for rabid Zionist Jeffrey R. Smulyan, chairman and CEO of Emmis (Hebrew for &#39;truth&#39;) Communications--which also happens to own Agent Jones&#39; flagship station in Austin.</p>

<p>These people cut Jones&#39; checks and tell him precisely what to say, when and how to say it, and what adverts for shafty gold dealers, seed vendors, and ineffective diet products go in between his embarrassing disinformation rants--in which Zionists or Jews are NEVER called out. Some say that his Jewish Zionist wife, Kelly Preston Nichols, is his agency &quot;handler.&quot;</p>

<p>If Jones had the balls to talk about the REAL problem facing this country--organized Jewry--Smulyan and STRAFOR would have him off the air immediately.</p>

<p>Remember this simple chain: CIA&gt;Trapwire&gt;STRATFOR (Israeli agents)&gt;Molly Maroney&gt;Alex Jones.</p>

<p>It does NOT get any clearer than that. He is there to fleece the goyim while letting the REAL criminals, the Zionist Ashkenazi Jews, get a free pass every time.</p>

<p>Want to know who &#39;they&#39; will look towards first when the revolution comes? That&#39;s right...the suckers that are subscribed to PrisonPlanet and InfoWars and comment. If you do, trust me, it&#39;s too late--you have already been put on a list of &quot;suspected&quot; domestic terrorists.</p>

<p>This is TRUE information and a very quick Google/Bing search will tell you all that you need to know--if that fucking INSANE rant on cunt Piers Morgan&#39;s show didn&#39;t already school you a bit. AJ is NOT ineloquent and is NOT stupid. He fakes &quot;passion&quot; incredibly well and very convincingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess we&#39;ll have to agree to disagree.  You have to remember that this is also a man who claimed that he literally punched someone so hard that their nose came off their face.  And he runs 10 miles a day and swims 50 laps around his lake and bench presses 400 lbs (and yet he is still fat).  The guy tries to make himself a superhero.  It&#39;s all the lying about unimportant stuff like that that makes me believe he isn&#39;t credible.  I still listen from time to time and check out his site and find some things that are real but he muddies the waters for people who only report facts.  A guy like a Glenn Greenwald gets hurt by a guy like an Alex Jones.</p>
