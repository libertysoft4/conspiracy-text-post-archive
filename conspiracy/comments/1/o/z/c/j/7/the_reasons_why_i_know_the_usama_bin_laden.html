        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-20062410/seal-helmet-cams-recorded-entire-bin-laden-raid/">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-20062410/seal-helmet-cams-recorded-entire-bin-laden-raid/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There were probably about maybe four, five or six photos,&quot; said Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md. &quot;There are just a couple body shots. He was like, in a white undershirt and a tan robe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(...)&quot;maybe four, five or six photos,&quot;(...)</p>

<p>If he saw four, five or six photos he would know exactly how many.</p>

<p>We also have lawmakers that have seen the photos so that should be proof enough for everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20062269-503544.html">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20062269-503544.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This morning at the CIA headquarters I saw the photos of a dead Osama bin Laden. I am convinced that this was bin Laden,&quot; Bachmann said in a statement. &quot;We got our man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Upon viewing the photos, he believes that there should be no doubt whatsoever that Osama bin Laden is indeed dead,&quot; a spokesman for Lieberman said in a statement on Thursday. &quot;Senator Lieberman also agrees with President Obama&#39;s decision not to release the photos.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three Republican senators, including Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA), were apparently fooled by a photograph circulating shortly after bin Laden&#39;s death, which showed a photoshopped image purporting to show bin Laden after he was killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20059844-503544.html">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20059844-503544.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I saw a photo of him deceased, obviously he had been wounded....when you see the picture it clearly has his features,&quot; said Ayotte. </p>

<p>When asked how he, a high-ranking member of the Intelligence committee, could have fallen for photos that might not be authentic, Chambliss replied, &quot;I was shown a photo by an individual that was represented to me as a picture of bin Laden after he&#39;s been shot that appeared to be an accurate photo. It was not an official photo.&quot; He said the person who shared the electronic photo with him was not an administration official.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in the end, having or not having people saying that they saw the pictures of Bin Laden dead cannot be taken as final proof at all.</p>

<p>And then we enter in the realm of ignorance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports the 40 minutes it took to kill bin Laden and scoop his archives into garbage bags were all recorded by tiny helmet cameras worn by each of the 25 SEALs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-20062410/seal-helmet-cams-recorded-entire-bin-laden-raid/">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The entire operation was recorded, including Bin Laden getting shot.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Officials reviewing those videos are still reconstructing a more accurate version of what happened. We now know that the only firefight took place in the guest house, where one of bin Laden&#39;s couriers opened fire and was quickly gunned down. No one in the main building got off a shot or was even armed, although there were weapons nearby. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-20062410/seal-helmet-cams-recorded-entire-bin-laden-raid/">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The sound of the helicopter and firefight inside his compound were not enough to make Bin Laden pick one of the weapons nearby. The same man that is seen everywhere firing AK-47s.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. officials cannot understand why bin Laden apparently left what amounts to the keys to his terrorist kingdom just lying around his compound in plain sight -- none of it rigged for self destruction.The killing of Osama bin Laden</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-20062410/seal-helmet-cams-recorded-entire-bin-laden-raid/">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Bin Laden left all of his documents in plain sight, unprotected and all inside the same room where he was killed.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>President Obama told CBS News Wednesday that he would not release the images, saying &quot;It is important to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20059844-503544.html">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Obama states that the pictures will not be released. There is no mention to the video of the operation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The White House has maintained that it does not intended to release any of the photos or videos, but their existence has stirred much controversy. While the helmet cam footage will go a long way in helping to better analyze the events that transpired during the raid in Abottabad, it seems unlikely that it will ever be seen by the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/13/bin-laden-raid-helmet-cams_n_861758.html">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Now we have the white house saying that the pictures and videos will not be released.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Leon Panetta, director of the CIA, revealed there was a 25 minute blackout during which the live feed from cameras mounted on the helmets of the US special forces was cut off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8493391/Osama-bin-Laden-dead-Blackout-during-raid-on-bin-Laden-compound.html">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>There was no video being transmitted into the situation room during the critical 25 minutes of the operation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael Leiter, then director of the National Counterterrorism Center, went into the room to watch the feed that was being relayed from a secret drone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/01/the-bin-laden-situation-room-revisited-one-year-later/">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>No mention of this video ever being recorded on file and now it was being fed by a secret drone, not from helmet cameras.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Spokesmen for the Department of Defense and U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment for this report about the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras.</p>

<p>&quot;We have not released any information on that operation, nor will we,&quot; U.S. SOCOM public affairs officer Ken McGraw told ABC News.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/osama-bin-laden-raid-navy-seal-helmet-cams/story?id=14205401">source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Now we don&#39;t have any confirmation on the use of helmet cameras.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>In the end we have four, five or six photos that won&#39;t be released.</p>

<p>No confirmation on any video being recorded.</p>

<p>A dead Seal Team and a very expensive helicopter destroyed.</p>

<p>Words.</p>

<p>And people believe that what they say is the truth? What should they instead believe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Serving and former US Navy SEALs have slammed President Barack Obama for taking the credit for killing Osama bin Laden and accused him of using Special Forces operators as ‘ammunition’ for his re-election campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever they don&#39;t show you the pictures, there is cause for concern.</p>

<p>The videos of 9/11 are ok to show over and over, but the video of bin Laden being killed could be an &quot;incitement to additional violence or a propaganda tool.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who believes in the official story of how they got Osama bin Laden is frankly a fool. </p>

<p>The whole evidence of his death is based on &quot;you don&#39;t need evidence... just trust what your leaders have told you&quot;. It&#39;s complete horseshit if anyone thinks that&#39;s enough.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the fact they lied a lot about what happened. <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/2/us-osama-used-wife-human-shield/">They lied about how Osama used his wife as a human shield</a>. Then <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/05/03/osama_human_shield/">the lie was retracted.</a></p>

<p>Then <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/navy-seal-shot-osama-bin-laden-sight/story?id=17200191">there is this whole story that he was shot on site.</a> However, that contradicts the story told by Osama&#39;s 12 year old daughter, who said <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/culture/2011/05/04/bin-ladens-daughter-says-he-was-taken-alive-then-shot-front-family-members">that he was captured alive and then shot in front of his family. </a></p>

<p>So yeah I really doubt that we caught all their lies but otherwise everything else is true. That&#39;s some major BS that people are willing to believe. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that after all this was over, they gave <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/21/us/bin-laden-burial/">a traditional burial for Osama bin Laden, to send him off.</a></p>

<p>And people believe all of that. </p>

<p>One of the members <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/26/world/bergen-who-killed-bin-laden/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">of the seal team even admits that the story was complete BS.</a> </p>

<p>What&#39;s the truth?
It&#39;s like that Osama would have told us that and they didn&#39;t want him to do that. So he was murdered so that we would never hear the full story from the &quot;enemy&quot;. Propaganda only works if we don&#39;t hear the other side of the story. <a href="http://cgi.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/">Keep in mind that Osama actually even denied being involved in 9/11</a>, and his FBI&#39;s most wanted list doesn&#39;t even <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/usama-bin-laden">state it as a crime that he committed.</a></p>
