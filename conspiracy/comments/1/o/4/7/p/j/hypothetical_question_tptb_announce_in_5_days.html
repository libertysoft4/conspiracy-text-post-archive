<p>When you realize that this life is a prison sentence, you stop looking at death as any sort of end.  You view it as a release.  This is a <em>good</em> thing.  I understand that some prisoners become institutionalized and actually prefer to <em>stay</em> in prison, but I&#39;m personally <em>very much</em> looking forward to finally getting out.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;ve apparently no understanding that I have is part (but not all) of what makes me feel bad for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Independent of the fact that this comment you just made has almost literally <em>nothing</em> to do with what I just stated above, it in itself is largely ignorant of the true extent of what it means to be grateful or ungrateful, as well as of the relativity of either state.  For you or anyone to call someone &quot;ungrateful&quot; who 1) might have a place to sleep and is not out on the street, but who is 2) still very much aware of the difficulty and often monumental vicissitude involved in life on this planet shows a great, great deal of arrogance and ignorance on your part.  Your inability to grasp how it is that one can live in the United States and yet <em>still</em> have an understanding of what true difficulty is like might say more about your short comings than theirs.</p>

<p>If you just got stabbed in the shoulder, would the fact that the person next to you just got shot in the stomach keep you from crying out in pain?  And exactly how intelligent or understanding - or even <em>correct</em> - would you be if you had the insensitive gall to berate the individual from crying out in pain who is now bleeding profusely from their arm?</p>

<p>Are my problems the &quot;biggest, most terrible&quot; problems in the world?  No, they&#39;re not.  Does that make them any less worthy, or significant, or difficult to deal with in their own right?  No.  It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Regardless, all this is independent of the real point involved in what I was initially referring to in the first place:  This life is <em>not</em> as closed and limited as most on this planet think it is.  It is a school - a generally difficult (read &quot;shitty&quot;) school for most.  One&#39;s job for the most part should be to learn as much as possible while in &quot;class&quot;, <em>pass</em> the class, and then look forward to moving on to the next lessons <em>elsewhere</em>.</p>

<p>In the end, it is exceedingly sad and actually borderline pitiful, now that I think about it, that you came on here asking a question the answers to which you have decided to berate if they don&#39;t exactly make sense to you or fit or coincide with your apparently <em>very</em> limited world view.</p>
