        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;All States are governed by a ruling class that is a minority of the population, and which subsists as a parasitic and exploitative burden upon the rest of society. Since its rule is exploitative and parasitic, the State must purchase the alliance of a group of “Court Intellectuals,” whose task is to bamboozle the public into accepting and celebrating the rule of its particular State. The Court Intellectuals have their work cut out for them. In exchange for their continuing work of apologetics and bamboozlement, the Court Intellectuals win their place as junior partners in the power, prestige, and loot extracted by the State apparatus from the deluded public. The noble task of Revisionism is to de-bamboozle: to penetrate the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history of the motivation, the nature, and the consequences of State activity. By working past the fog of State deception to penetrate to the truth, to the reality behind the false appearances, the Revisionist works to delegitimize, to desanctify, the State in the eyes of the previously deceived public.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really a pot/kettle thing to me. They&#39;re persistent greed and lack of concern for environmental or human consequence in their quest for more money, more power, and more control becomes the dominant thread of a culture heading the wrong way. When I see Wal-Mart morons killing each other over TVs on Black Friday, I think, &quot;that is the same mentality of TPTB,&quot; except these people have been dumbed down and brainwashed to accept their position. If they were smarter but never looked inward as to what drove them to want to consume without mercy, they likely could end up with a modicum of power and behave the same way as the elites, drilling, killing, domain acting, bribing, and manipulating for their own benefit. </p>

<p>The mischief springs from the power which the moneyed interest derives from a paper currency which they are able to control, from the multitude of corporations with exclusive privileges which they have succeeded in obtaining in the different States, and which are employed altogether for their benefit; and unless you become more watchful and check this spirit of monopoly and thirst for exclusive privileges you will in the end find that the most important powers of Government have been given or bartered away, and the control over your dearest interests has passed into the hands of these corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every society needs a ruling class. It is foolish to imagine that we can ever do away with our ruling class completely. If we remove one, another will arise to take its place. The Russians discovered this after the Communist Revolution.</p>

<p>What is needed is a ruling class that does not abuse its power. This is difficult to achieve, since it is the natural tendency for any ruling class to abuse its power. But a ruling class that is subject to the rule of law, and that is raised with an awareness of its duties to the rest of society, that shuns those in its midst who defraud and abuse their privileges -- that is the ideal situation, and the best that any society can hope for.</p>
