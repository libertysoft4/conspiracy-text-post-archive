    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand (nobody else said it or sees it I guess) debt first before you post this.</p>

<p>The US does not own its own currency. For every dollar/cent made, there is a tax on that dollar/cent. The federal reserve prints the money that the government will ultimately use to pay them back. Now...if were taxed on every dollar/cent printed and we have to pay each dollar/cent back with the tax they place on it (not mentioning the mandatory 6%/month in pay to the feds); of which, we have to get the money for the tax from the fed who taxes that money....how can you pau this back?</p>

<p>Answer: it is impossible.</p>

<p>Only when you control your own money can you get out of debt. So, right now, our debt is pointless (higher does not matter).</p>

<p>Venezuela paid its debt in one year (I believe) after abolishing the central bank. ONE YEAR.</p>

<p>How fucking retarded do you have to be to spend more money than you have? Honestly.</p>

<p>Three presidents... I repeat... three US presidents lost their lives due to the banks. Lincoln, Jackson, and Kennedy. I&#39;m not an expert on the first two; but, check out Kennedy&#39;s executive order on the federal reserve and what the first damn thing that happened after his assassination.</p>

<p>End pissed off rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people need to start getting it right. You currently do not use any &quot;money&quot; at all, you use &quot;NOTES&quot;, which are CREDIT notes. This means, whenever you think that you buy something, you actually receive it on credit.....you never own anything for one second. And the equal amount of credit is created simultaneously on the FED side, and this is called &quot;National Debt&quot;. The population then pays interest on that....to the FED. And the FED is a foreign owned entity. Because USA (capital letters) is a CORPORATION. And the independence war was a farce to move you guys into that Corporation. Tough to swallow. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the United States, however, and in many other countries, the government does not have the right to issue currency to pay for its bills. In this case, the government must finance its deficit by first issuing bonds to the public to acquire the extra funds to pay the bills.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>1) Who has that &quot;right&quot; to issue currency and what gives/gave them that &quot;right&quot;?</li>
<li>2) Why are our leaders on currency that is not &quot;ours&quot;?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The Federal Reserve is given the right by OUR GOVERNMENT. And it can be taken away by OUR GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>2) It is basically ours, see #1.</p>

<p>3) Because the bonds are sold to the banks and the populace. Why would they lend the government money for nothing in return.</p>

<p>Seriously, I like a lot of the conspiracies here, but the Federal Reserve ones are just fueled by total ignorance - which isn&#39;t too surprising as it took me many many classes to finally understand what was going on.</p>

<p>2) If it&#39;s ours why does our tax money pay interest on something made from nothing </p>

<p>3) The populace doesn&#39;t hold most of this debt.  Why would the government need to borrow money made from nothing and force the people to pay interest for this money made from nothing when <strong>it could create interest free money based on tangible goods and services</strong>?  But like my book said it doesn&#39;t have the right...... right?</p>

<p>Completely wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. And the equal amount of credit is created simultaneously on the FED side, and this is called &quot;National Debt&quot;. The population then pays interest on that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Federal Reserve buys a percentage of the national debt. It currently owns about 12% of national debt. The Fed doesn&#39;t create the debt. Most of the debt is owned by other parties and they get the interest on the bonds that they own.</p>

<p>The Fed also gives back to the government almost all of the interest it receives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the FED is a foreign owned entity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK had nothing against the Federal Reserve and Executive Order 11110 did nothing to reduce the Fed&#39;s power.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">Executive Order 11110</a> was part of President Kennedy&#39;s plan to <em>stop producing</em> silver certificates and replace them with Federal Reserve notes. The executive order was necessary because of the <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/UnitedStatesStatutesAtLargeVolume77_1963/UnitedStatesStatutesAtLargeVolume77#page/n80/mode/1up">new law</a> that Kennedy signed that same day which removed the Treasury Secretary&#39;s power to print silver certificates by his own authorization. To allow the continued printing while the Federal Reserve notes were being readied, Kennedy signed the order, which delegated the president&#39;s authority.</p>

<p>G. Edward Griffin, author of the anti-Fed book, <em>The Creature from Jekyll Island</em>, also rejects the theory that Executive Order 11110 had anything to do with Kennedy&#39;s assassination. See his article, <a href="http://www.freedomforceinternational.org/freedomcontent.cfm?fuseaction=jfkmyth">&quot;The JFK Myth&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a newspaper article from the time:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=60BYAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=d_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=4270,1590553">&quot;Kennedy Signs Silver Bill&quot;</a><br/>
<em>Spokane Daily Chronicle</em>, June 6, 1963, p. 34</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Colorado Springs, Colo. (AP) — President Kennedy announced yesterday President Kennedy announced yesterday the signing of a bill permitting the gradual melting down of silver bullion reserve for use in making coins.</p>

<p>The measure was signed Tuesday but the announcement was delayed until Kennedy reached this silver producing state on the first leg of a five-day, five-state western trip.</p>

<p>Under the new law, pushed by the administration, the Treasury will be able to retire silver certificates paper money no backed by silver bullion as the bullion is melted down for coinage. The silver certificates would be replaced by federal reserve notes.</p>

<p>The new law also would permit eventual melting down of silver dollars for use in coins of smaller denominations.</p>

<p>In addition to signing the administration bill, Kennedy issued an executive order permitting the Treasury to continue use of silver certificates for as long as necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we have a situation like the matrix, those who are not disengaged are consider to be the &quot;enemy&quot; until their minds are freed. at this stage we have those on the &quot;inside&quot; still, and those who are unplugged and see things for what they really are.</p>

<p>Those who are unplugged have the simple advantage of understanding MONEY PRINTED AS DEBT and central banking. As when it comes down to it, control the currency supplies is all it is about, EVERYTHING!...so at this time the &quot;invisible steak eaters&quot; are simply unaware of how their currency is created, who it benefits and whre it is all leading. Remember, the unknowing enemy, the masses, will not only destroy your reality by sucking you in via a democratic mob rules false reality, they will also make you assume the debt along with them.</p>

<p>You must understand some things about the media, it is like a paper army related to &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;figures&quot;, because it shows you it&#39;s vantage of reality, it very much wants you to think &quot;everyone thinks that!&quot; whatever that may be, &quot;that&quot; related to this is that people do not understand and or their version of &quot;things&quot; is reality. I think there are more unplugged people than it may seem and that one must be cautious when assuming their version of reality.</p>

<p>Raise ceiling or not, it does nothing but buy a little time in an intentionally crumbling Ponzi scam...</p>

<p>The destruction of the dollar is very intentional, crafted by the ones in control of it, slowly, ever so so slowly they will &quot;lay it down&quot;</p>

There wouldn&#39;t need to be groups defecting, there would need to be every able bodied man and woman standing up and fighting for what belongs to them. We need the full strength of the American people to even think of change. This war hasn&#39;t even started yet and we&#39;re losing it. The only way the people will make a change is by losing the sense of entitlement and complacency that they have hardwired into them. Show them the truth, show them that they are being oppressed and abused, and let everybody know that this is our country. The people have the power, they just forgot how to use it.</p>

Still a lot of money, but the embarrassing fact is that the Obama administration is doing more to reduce the deficit than any President since Clinton (who balanced the budget at least once.)  And we&#39;ve had faster reduction than any time since WWII.</p>

<p>I still support destroying the Fed, but the Republican propaganda seems to be filtering into this sub and distorting the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is sad to me that in the current political environment, people are forced to point out someone doing their job as a breath of fresh air just because so many asshats are distorting what&#39;s really happening with government spending.  Case in point, that article you linked.</p>

<p>The Christian Science Monitor used to be such a good paper - why do they suck so much partisan cock these days?  Another distortion - I can&#39;t even give the President credit where credit is due, in case I look like I condone everything his administration does.  Ridiculous - but pertinent in this media climate.</p>

<p>In answer to that hit piece - 2 terms of Republican warmongering and keeping it off the books, plus creation of the third largest bureaucracy in our cabinet departments after Defense and Veteran Affairs, Dept. of Homeland Security - THAT is what raised government spending to the current astronomical level. I don&#39;t see much criticism from the so-called &#39;fiscal conservatives.&#39;  Since I am an ACTUAL fiscal conservative, I support the administration&#39;s efforts, as paltry as they may seem.  Then again I don&#39;t give a fuck about political parties as much as I just want things to get better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I get the anger over the Fed and central banking - it&#39;s a global scam.  And getting our government to reduce borrowing for spending, eliminating pork and waste in the government, legal and tax reform - these are all pretty important.</p>

<p>Then again, so is our global credit rating.  What I resist is not the impetus to reign in the government financially, but the hollow call for change from the same assholes who drove us into this mess.  And I object to the very idea of a crisis.  We need to proceed calmly and intelligently, not all this subterfuge about the real issues and the true stakes.</p>
