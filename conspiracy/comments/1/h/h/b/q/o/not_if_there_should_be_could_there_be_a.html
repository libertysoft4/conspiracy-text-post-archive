    <div class="md"><p>It will be staged just like the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; was staged.  All of these stories of &quot;leaks&quot; and the obvious 2nd Amendment bashing is creating the atmosphere.  Watch out for false leaders with words of violence, we are getting manipulated and co-opted guys, just keep on your toes.  The only way to &quot;win&quot;(if you can call it winning) is to NOT comply and not give in to manipulation... and do yourself a favor read this:  <a href="http://monoskop.org/images/4/44/Ellul_Jacques_Propaganda_The_Formation_of_Mens_Attitudes.pdf">http://monoskop.org/images/4/44/Ellul_Jacques_Propaganda_The_Formation_of_Mens_Attitudes.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things needed for a revolution to occur:</p>

<p><strong>1. A Violation of Human Rights</strong></p>

<p>These rights serve as a security blanket. The presence of human rights protects each person from any form of abuse. It gives each one the freedom to have a voice in society and to live peacefully. It assures everyone of equality. A violation of these rights creates chaos within oneself that eventually affects society. Anybody who moves towards the abolishment of such rights is guilty of taking advantage of others. This is usually brought about by the the desire for power.</p>

<p><strong>2. Failure of the Government to Meet with the Demands of the People</strong></p>

<p>The main role of any government is to serve and lead its sovereign people towards improvement. This can only be achieved through proper communication with the people its supposed to serve. The failure of the government comes in when it no longer sees the people as top priority. This usually happens when the leaders put themselves first and work in order to attain their personal goals.</p>

<p><strong>3. A Want for Freedom</strong></p>

<p>This is the common yearning of those who fall victim under abuse. When ones plea upon being violated is not heard, these people are most likely to protest.</p>

<p><strong>4. A Unanimous Realization of the Need for a Major Change</strong></p>

<p>This is the very essence that motivates any revolution. Reform is the key word. A revolution may choose as its object a political transformation, a social transformation, or a simple change of ruler. This unanimous realization serves as the uniting factor ofsubordinate groups in their attempt to transform the social foundations of political power.</p>

<p><strong>5. Unity</strong></p>

<p>Unity is accomplished when one looks at what the revolting body has in common as opposed to their differences.</p>

Damand your government back voting, protesting and signing petition DO NOT WORK THEY DO NOT CARE. Stop the government in it&#39;s tracks request your w-4 back and put on it exempt on the reasons of you are not supporting a terrorists country financially. If most of you people did this that and along with just walking in and citizens arresting most of your major financial institution. This would send a way bigger message the them than killing yourselves in revolution/revolt. That is the last and only resort that is when all other options have failed. This is the time for complete and total civil disobedience starve these motherfu*kers of all our money!!!.</p>
