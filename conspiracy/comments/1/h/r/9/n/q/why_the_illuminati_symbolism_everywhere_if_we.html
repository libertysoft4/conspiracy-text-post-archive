say this isn&#39;t all just coincidental and these everyday symbols have been placed throughout our popular culture for some strategic reason,
What would the purpose be? if the Iluminati&#39;s goal was to sit in behind the scenes and control massive populations unnoticed then why saturate a culture in your symbolism? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Illuminati.</p>

<p>Root word: luminosus. (light / lux / lucere)</p>

<p>The light is the symbol for the intellect. The mind. The bringer of light is the bringer of mind. The light bringer was Prometheus. Prometheus is a substitute for Lucifer. Lucifer was the sun of the morning star. What is the morning star? What is the star that causes morning? The Sun. The biggest light of all. The mind of God washing over the plains from the East.</p>

<p>Any time you see a Prometheus reference lok for the symbolism because it might be a Luciferian reference (the latest Super Man movie had a very obvious Prometheus reference in the beginning - in fact there&#39;s a shit ton of Luciferian and TransHumanist bull in that flick).</p>

<p>Important:</p>

<p>Lucifer is not a name. It is a title. It only means &#39;light bearer.&#39;</p>

<p>Satan is not a name. It is a title. It means &#39;accuser.&#39;</p>

<p><em>Do not confuse the two</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Bible, the Hebraic text in Isaiah 14:12 refers to Helel Ben Shachar or Heylel Ben-Shachar (הילל בן שחר) . Helel Ben-Schachar is translated into English as “O shining star, son of the dawn!&quot; (&quot;O Lucifer, son of the morning&quot; in the KJV) The name Lucifer is a translation of Helel Ben-Shachar into Latin by St. Jerome in the fourth century. Lucifer derives from two Latin words, lux (light) and fero (to bear–to bring), meaning light-bearer, light-bringer. The Bible identifies Lucifer as Devil, Satan, serpent, dragon, dweller of hell and other names. <a href="http://www.thebabylonmatrix.com/index.php?title=911:Occult_symbolism_VII#Lucifer">Full article here</a> </p>

<p>Same as Jesus <a href="http://www.thebabylonmatrix.com/index.php?title=911:Titles_of_Jesus">has many titles</a>, so has <a href="http://www.thebabylonmatrix.com/index.php?title=911:Occult_symbolism_VII#The_many_names.2FTitles_of_the_Devil">the devil</a>... </p>

<p>As for Prometheus ... Prometheus, a Titan of Greek mythology known for his great intelligence. He has however betrayed the god Zeus by stealing fire and giving it to mankind. He therefore credited to have taught mankind the arts of civilization such as writing, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and science. Zeus then punished Prometheus for his crime by having him bound to a rock ... This story is just a parallelism of the story of Satan/Devil/Heylel Ben-Shachar who rebelled against God and &quot;enlightened&quot; mankind with his knowledge</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Every form existing in the diversified sphere of being is symbolic of the divine activity by which it is produced. By symbols men have ever sought to communicate to each other those thoughts which transcend the limitations of language. Rejecting man-conceived dialects as inadequate and unworthy to perpetuate divine ideas, the Mysteries thus chose symbolism as a far more ingenious and ideal method of preserving their transcendental knowledge. In a single figure a symbol may both reveal and conceal , for to the wise the subject of the symbol is obvious, while to the ignorant the figure remains inscrutable. He who seeks to unveil the secret doctrine of antiquity must search for that doctrine not upon the open pages of books which might fall into the hands of the unworthy but in the place where it was originally concealed.&quot; Manly P. Hall, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, p. 20</p>

<p>Far-sighted were the initiates of antiquity. They realized that nations come and go, that empires fall, and that the golden ages of art, science, and idealism are succeeded by the dark ages of superstition. With the needs of posterity foremost in mind, the sages of old went to inconceivable extremes to make certain that their knowledge should be preserved. They engraved it upon the face of mountains and concealed it with the measurements of colossal images, each of which was a geometric marvel.</p>

<p>Their knowledge of chemistry and mathematics -see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gb0Bi8eqAA">The Secret of the Universe 2008, the clues left by Edward Leedskalnin at Coral Castle</a> they hid within mythologies which the ignorant would perpetuate, or in the spans and arches of their temples which time has not entirely obliterated. They wrote in characters that neither the vandalism of men nor the ruthlessness of the elements could completely efface. Today men gaze with awe and reverence upon the mighty Memnons (Pyramids) standing alone on the sands of Egypt, or upon the strange terraced pyramids of Palanque. Mute testimonies these are of the lost arts and sciences of antiquity; and concealed this wisdom must remain until this race has learned to read the universal language – SYMBOLISM. </p>

<p>Your comments are on point as well. Thanks.</p>

<p>For those who want an in depth and visual review of occult symbolism as practiced by today&#39; celebrities and influencers, download the <a href="http://www.conspirazzi.com/codex-magica-by-texe-marrs/">PDF</a> or the <a href="http://www.epubbud.com/book.php?g=TBN93CHY">EPUB</a> of Texe Marrs&#39; book Codex Magica. Or read it <a href="http://www.epubbud.com/book.php?g=TBN93CHY">online</a>. It has over a thousand graphics and photos. Note that it skews Christian but has plenty of valuable info for those with alternative belief systems.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a dick here so please stay with me. </p>

<p>How can you be so sure.? Do you have doubt in your mind that this is all true? You are definitely in the minority on this and even on this sub no one has any sort of consensus. </p>

<p>Have you heard of Occams Razor? It is a rule saying if there are two different theories and all else is equal then the simpler one is likely true. For instance all of these symbols everywhere could be to make us used to this luciferian religion, so as not to protest. But this assumes that there is a giant luciferian religion, that they are trying on secret to convert the world, that these symbols are in fact part of their religion and that they aren&#39;t placed by someone who just happened to like the image, that the illuminati exist and weren&#39;t just created for a fictional book who&#39;s name escapes me right now. </p>

<p>For the theory that they are just symbols placed because symbols evolve and stay in societies through time. And tend to crop up. And maybe even there were some clubs and fraternities in early America with these symbols and they used them where they could but without the added attempt to take over the world or summon Satan.</p>

<p>Which of these do you think requires less assumptions? </p>

<p>As for the bible (new and old testament) being anti-Iluminati, to understand this you need to study the prophecies of the bible, specially the parallels between the empires of the book of Daniel and the book of Revelations.

    <div class="md"><p>The goal is for the population to accept the symbolism subconsciously first. If they see it everywhere they accept it as &quot;normal&quot;. If and when the Illuminati come out of the closet, which they must, they hope they will then be accepted by the population.</p>

<p>Another aspect is that for spiritual justification (according to universal law) they have must told the population the truth in some form, however briefly. Similar to the fine print on a contract or a packaging. That way the &quot;fault&quot; is on the people for not recognizing the truth and reacting accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at it this way. Even if the Iluminati doesn&#39;t exist, the symbol is there as a reminder of how all the governmental powers work together as a form of oppression against the people they are uspposed to be working for. If you simply think of each branch of government and other countries as their own, anotomous state, then it becomes a lot harder to imagine these things like the NSA spying scandal to be possible. But if you realize that behind closed doors, they are all part of the same group, acting in the same collective interest, these &quot;coincidences&quot; don&#39;t seem too strange. </p>

<p>Since domination over others is the goal within primate societies, those that want to become the &quot;alpha male&quot; characters take these symbols and use them, believing that it will mark them out as belonging to the alpha male class.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is mostly capitalism. Think about it. The videos you see on youtube that contain those symbols will get people talking about how they purposely place it in them at random points in the video, thus resulting in more views. The more views the channel get, the higher the revenue. It&#39;s just a thought but it kinda makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although the phenomena you mention does occur, &quot;mostly&quot; seems an overstatement. It is unlikely that anything in today&#39;s highly produced videos is random. </p>

<p>E.g., it is random that Miley Cyrus has <a href="http://imgur.com/fiBucbU">an all seeing eye on her right pointer finger</a> in the her new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco">We Can&#39;t Stop</a>, video which is rife with occult symbolism? </p>

<p>I doubt that many of the 54M views are because of the occult symbolism, though some of them are. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think that whoever places the symbols in the videos is certainly happy that many people simply consider them an artifact of capitalism. The Manly P. Hall quote from the previous post refers to most  people as &quot;the ignorant.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The symbol is everywhere and defiantly not a coincidence. The question is what does it mean? And why are so many people connecting Illuminati to things like JFK assassination when all evidence points to CIA?
It&#39;s just a weird thing. I suspect the symbol has something to do with the enlightenment movement (actually a good thing), but people in the intelligence community who would like to cover their tracks are grasping at whatever they can find to make up an alternative conspiracy for people to latch onto. It&#39;s easy to be drawn into this stuff though, they are very devious people.
I still cannot be 100% sure it was CIA and not something else but certainly whatever organization is behind it is a very powerful, militarized force with close links to the government. As RFK said: &quot;We knew it was a high level domestic conspiracy.&quot; Apparently JFK described the CIA as &quot;that shadow government behind my back.&quot;. The fact that so many CIA and FBI people are on the list of suspicious deaths and unsolved murders suggests these organizations were at-least involved in some way. Even if it was the Mafia that killed him don&#39;t forget that the Mafia was on the CIA payroll. They often pay organized criminals to do their work, which if you think about it is highly unethical because it makes that sort of crime pay.</p>
