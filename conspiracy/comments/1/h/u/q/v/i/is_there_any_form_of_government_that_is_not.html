        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been countless different types of government all throughout history, and all of them have fallen at one time or another to corruption of those on top, countless &quot;Democracies&quot; that have transitioned to either fascist states or dictatorships. Saddam&#39;s Iraq called itself a Democracy, as do North Korea and Iran. Even Russia, which allows unlimited terms as long as their non consecutive, Which Vladimir Putin will always hold the office in some form. And we&#39;re begging to realize that the united states isn&#39;t far behind if it&#39;s not already there. So my question is at some point in the future, will we ever be able to build a governed society in which there are true checks and balances to prevent the wealthy and those with special interests from gaining power and pulling the strings from behind the scenes? or more to the point, when the time comes, what should replace the federal government as we all know it&#39;s a matter of when not if this happens. </p>

That or keep everything broken into groups so small the people being ruled/governed maintain power enough to fix/dismiss corruption as it happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree with the small governments, I would like to see a system where small areas, somethings along the lines of areas being divided into self governing entities by population, nothing more than maybe 8-10 million people that had a direct democracy with no real position of power, there would be no need for a house of representatives as every vote counts directly, All laws would be decided directly by the people and carried out by that areas establishment. No president or governor, every tax dollar spent would be approved only by those paying the taxes and there would be something physical backing the economy like the gold standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, I&#39;m no politician but I can see that our system is clearly broken, and if anything changes I would at very least like to see a system without political parties. That is what I despise most about our current system. Either a democrat or a republican will be elected every time, and I honestly don&#39;t fully agree with either side. And it&#39;s obvious and almost painful to watch them each do only the opposite of the other. </p>

I only replied because I too hate our current system, but for everything it does wrong... It just has too much momentum, and it set up at least to do one or two things right. I hate parties and republicans and democrats. Our founding fathers never once even dreamed of voting in a primary or whatever. The two party system is a fucking joke. I hope I didn&#39;t kill any potential stroke of genius here. Meant to get ya thinking, not get ya quitting :/ my bad mate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that there makes you a god damned winner :) I don&#39;t know if my 20 year old, Only voted once, gets most of my news from reddit ass could teach you anything, but I&#39;m all for debating/talking it through. I tend to find myself looping through these conversations in my head and remember this exact one from a couple of weeks ago. I like the idea of throwing it all out and starting over, but at the same time, they just solve too many problems to give it an honest try. Its like.... Tires. They are horribly inneficient and suck, I&#39;m sure there is a better way/tool we could be using underneath our x-million cars driving around, but since I was born, tires have been used so its damn near impossible to think of am alternative. Same with the political systems in place around the world. Maybe that&#39;s what separates genious level intelligence from me and everybody else. The ability to create a truly new idea...</p>

And then once we decide the bridge is a big enough problem it needs voted on I can&#39;t go vote again on that bridge. Unless. Well. Unless the whole system changed and we finally began utilizing the technology available to us, but then things like social status/ family incomes become an issue because not everyone is on the same page technologically.

    <div class="md"><p>Direct democracys fails. The founders were very clear that they did not want a direct democracy. 1 choice should be made but 10 people want 10 different choices. Im sure you know why else from all the other comments.</p>

<p>The founders looked long and hard for a suitable government and what they laid out, I believe, is the least corruptable government. They believed government to be a necessary evil. &quot;A dangerous servant and a fearful master&quot; I believe the quote to be. </p>

<p>The federal govermnets responsibilty was to make sure all the states followed the consituion. THATS IT. States were primarily in charge as they are more easily manageable by the people. Switzerlands government is similar to this and they are, strangly, more free than the US.</p>

<p>There was never supposed to be one nation, but a land of soverign states and free men. To do whatever they want as long as you dont cause harm to others or property. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They indeed were not infalible. B. Frank was a troll, drunkard and womanizer, and T. Jeff was a hypocrite as he preached freedom for all men and owned slaves. However, that could be said about any organized event or group of any size. If the people involved arnt on board with it, it will fail.</p>

<p>People are just as every bit as moral and virtues as before. However the government we have today is NOTHING like it was meant out to be. thats why there are all these problems that never seem to go away.
it used to be, you can do whatever you want with your life, liberty and property as long as it didnt interfere with another right to do the same. With this mindset, a country can and will thrive without thousands of laws, trillions of dollars in spending and handouts for its people. it has worked and was working.</p>

Now, human kind have SOCIALLY evolved a lot since then, and with more of a civilized approach to the tribal structure, it would be astronomically superior to today&#39;s traditional government structures as, in the tribal structure, <em>everyone</em> would get a word - a DIRECT word - in the workings of things.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the Jamahiriya of Libya was/is one of the most effective systems of governance in the world. It&#39;s a system of direct democracy in which everything was run and decided upon by citizens councils. Anyone and everyone has a say in what happens. Jamahirya is like a more structured version of Anarchism. It was so effective it took Libya from being the poorest nation on earth, to being the most prosperous and most progressive nation in Africa and the Middle East in just four decades. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it failed in part due to the authoritarianism which is rife within certain sections of the Islamic world. You see, Jamahirya was able to make most Libyans happy independent and free. However, the radical Islamists based out of Benghazi and Misrata were not happy with a secular Libya, and the west.....ern oil interests were not happy with a Socialist Libya. The problem was that the weak central government and lack of unified military force makes/made Libya incredibly susceptible to attack from a more powerful military force (interestingly the Republic of civl war era Spain also experienced nearly the exact same problem, you can start to see a trend now by the authoritarians of the world to oppress liberalism and democracy). The problem is (and 9/11 and pre-WWII US in some part prove this) that when you have a people that have everything they need and a high quality of life they aren&#39;t all that interested in going to war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think the technology exists to have a robotic shit-shoveler? There are robots that diffuse bombs, and you don&#39;t think they can shovel shit? Hell, that&#39;s extremely basic robotics that a 5 year old in Japan could probably build. The reason they aren&#39;t everywhere is because <em>shit-shovelers require a paycheck to live</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dog no. Like, fine. The 5 year old builds the shit shoveler, why does he build it Btw? Because if its that basic? Its not creative or ingenuitive? So pretending he still wasted his time doing a less than awesome task for no reason because money doesn&#39;t exist, how are you going to get the 2000000 shit shovelers across farms all around the world? 20000000 Asian kids in Japan just happen to want to waste their time building a basic robot when they could be exploring their artistic passions and creative overflow? Ok. So pretend for whatever reason they did this. Fuck it. I&#39;ll buy into that, now how do these robots get displaced? Like from 5 year olds bedroom to farm with shit that needs shoveling? Nobody likes drilling oil man, and those rigs don&#39;t run themselves. Currently people do it it because it pays something like 60-80k a month, but remove the money, who lime drilling oil? Ok pretend some 20000 25 year olds (leaving some room with the age since this might be a more advanced robot) decide they are going to build oil drilling robots, now that oil has to be made into gas and transferred to the ships that apparently a crew is going to volunteer to run (unless were making automatic robots to run oil tankers) to ggo pickul the shit shovelers and then sail back to drop off the robots and get picked up by???? Automatic truckers to drive the robots to rural Wyoming (where the shit that needs shoveling is) what are all these middle men going to be doing now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great question. Obviously, some systems are better than others, but even America&#39;s great Republic was (and is) prone to corruption.</p>

<p>The problem is not the system of government - the problem is the people. Government will always be prone to corruption (look around the world and find me one non-corrupt government). </p>

<p>Look at the apathy in the US, and ask yourself if there is ANY kind of government that would not be corrupted very quickly, no matter what system it was run upon.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t blame the system - blame us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly with the technology we have today, it&#39;s possible to have a completely transparent and democratic government. Think of it this way: There&#39;s an app on your phone or something that shows you what your elected officials have been doing. Since you elected that official, you can veto against the elected official&#39;s created policy if you believe it doesn&#39;t represent what you voted for. There could be a threshold number for the amount of citizen vetoes required to nullify a vote in your state or federal legislature. We could even have a requirement to nullify executive orders if we wanted to. We could also have petitions that actually mattered. We have the technology and capabilities of having a very open and transparent government, it&#39;s just not in the best interest in the powers that be. Additionally, I also believe that after experiencing completely transparent government, most people will realize we don&#39;t even need a government at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that a perfect Government ever be formed is non-sense. A Government depends on it&#39;s people as much as it&#39;s people depend on their Government. If the people are not educated, how can they make informed decisions as to how they want their Government run?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So me and a mate had this conversation a while back and we sort of came to this conclusion. If everything is publicly available, what incentive is there to do the shit nobody wants to do, or to do your job well, or to be any better than the man standing next to you. I&#39;m not gonna clean portapottys every day until I die if it means I&#39;m gonna get to live in the same house and eat the same food that Freddy the guy that sweeps McDonalds at night time gets to eat/live in. And I&#39;m sure as fuck not gonna risk my life as a firefighter if my only reward coming home is. Oh wait there is no reward. Why was I at work today? I could be a leech and still participate in the communist government right? And who is to say I can&#39;t if there is not central/private government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t resize the prior cases were not true communism, but one issue I do have, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, is that if all wages are equal, then what would drive someone better at their job? I know that lots of people would not put in the extra effort if they were not getting an extra reward. as much as capitalism is evil, it still drives innovation. and give the individual a goal which is to succeed by bettering themselves in order to obtain their frivolous material possessions.</p>
