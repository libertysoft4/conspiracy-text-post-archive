        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Simple question. There seems to have been a shift recently after the PRISM scandal etc. and a lot of people are starting to agree with things we theorists have been discussing for a long time. Are any of you people who came during a period of high traffic, such as the Boston bombings, just to make fun but after recent revelations found yourself agreeing with us on certain ideas? If so what event made you begin questioning the offical narrative and what conspiracy theories have began making more sense to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be suprised. I work in a professional setting and for too long said nothing about anything outside of main stream news. Probably a year ago now I decided to started saying things like &quot;that seemed off to me&quot; or just talking in general about how the information being released did not make sense. I&#39;m so glad I did.  I found people with questions and people that are deeper in it than I am.  My work takes me to different medical and research facilities so most of the people I talk to are doctors of different sorts which always makes the conversation more interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is interesting. My fiance&#39;s grandparents get their news from CNN nightly news and were surprised to hear why Brazil was actually in an uprising after CNN brushed it off saying they were just  a few anti-government protesters. After I told them about the legislation that Brazil was pissed about, they said &quot;Well I would be angry too!&quot; It&#39;s interesting where you get your news source from. TV news is dying and the Internet is a free speech zone for now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve definitely seen a shift in perception on reddit. When once &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; was a constant insult people are calling out those guys out and are now more willing to ask questions about events because of PRISM. </p>

<p>People aren&#39;t now just giving the benefit of the doubt to the government or corporations and ridiculing those that question them, they have to prove what they&#39;re saying or else it&#39;s probably bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came here to help spread the truth about certain matters and to learn the truth about others. Certain people on this SR (and we all know the people) are here only to be contrarian dickheads. The type that would argue with you about ANYTHING--be it Chemtrails, 9/11, or even &quot;proven&quot; conspiracies such as the Gulf of Tonkin, the USS Liberty--you name it. They exist just to mentally masturbate all over people like US...people who are after the truth. People who are sick of the lies.</p>

<p>THAT was my only surprise. I thought that I would be lauded (as a Jew) for telling the truth about what I have seen in my &quot;ethnic community&quot; growing up--and now--just to be called a &quot;self-hater&quot; and made fun of. I was shocked that there are more than a few people on here who have NO interest in &quot;conspiracies&quot;--only in making fun of people who are discussing possibilities!</p>

<p>Luckily, those of us who have been here a while and who contribute to some of the great discussion on this forum know who these people are--and we have learned to either ignore them or beat them over the head with their own ignorance.</p>

<p>I ALWAYS questioned the &quot;official&quot; narrative. I am old (mid-40s) and I remember that the first real &quot;conspiracy&quot; I questioned was JFK. I mean, I had gone hunting with my uncles (at around 5 years old) and saw what happened when a bullet hit flesh. When I saw the Zapruder film I was blown away (to say the least) that &quot;official&quot; people said that the &quot;kill shot&quot; came from BEHIND the President--even 5-year-old me knew better than that!!</p>

<p>At nine years old I saw a classic, saucer-shaped shiny silver UFO hovering in the desert and watched it hover...then watched it shoot directly UP at a rate of speed that my young mind coundn&#39;t even begin to compute. I remember that it shot off and I was left watching the cloud of sand and dust that it pulled up from the ground blow around and away in the wind and convincing myself that, yes, I DID really see that! Luckily, so did my father and mother and little brother. This vehicle could NOT have been manned by humans because they would have been smashed into something as thin as a sheet of paper by the G&#39;s. This thing went from hovering to, probably, at least 2000mph in far less time than it takes to type it. </p>

<p>After that I started reading up on &quot;Project Blue Book&quot; and saw other pictures of craft--one JUST like I saw!! I had nightmares for ages. Then &quot;Close Encounters&quot; came out; more nightmares.</p>

<p>Anyhow, those two instances are what me KNOW, for a 100% fact, that the governement is keeping a LOT under it&#39;s hat--and that we don&#39;t know ANYTHING--speaking relatively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a quick thought about your UFO experience, if I may.  The reason that you are not crushed inside these craft when they &#39;shoot straight up&#39; is because they are generating what equates to essentially their own gravity.  Thus they are neutral in relation to the gravity of the earth.  When the craft accelerates, the people inside feel virtually nothing.  Another way to think about it is, the earth is travelling at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour, but we don&#39;t feel it, we don&#39;t even feel the rotation of the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought.</p>

<p>So, in essence, there is &quot;Earth gravity&quot; and &quot;local gravity&quot; and the people (or what have you) inside are subjected only to the &quot;local&quot; gravity; correct?</p>

<p>The analogy about the Earth is a very good one if I may say so...right now we are hurtling through space at 18,000 mph as I sit here typing and I don&#39;t feel a thing...yet if I fired a bullet 1000 yards downrange the rotation of the Earth would ensure that I did NOT hit my target--unless I compensated for it. I think its called the &quot;Coreolis Effect&quot; or something of the sort.</p>

<p>Anyhow, thanks for the ELI5 explanation! I always wondered about that.</p>
