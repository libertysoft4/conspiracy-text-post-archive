<p>It&#39;s rare that I am shocked these days by something new I learn about history but I was surprised to learn of the clearly exposed links to British corproate agents in these presidential assassinations. It isn&#39;t highlighted in US history classes!</p>

<p>To save you some time I have highlighted the important 30 second parts of the 58 minute documentary and if that peeks your interest you might want to watch the whole thing from the beginning. Watch these parts however for about 30 second each to get the jist of it.</p>

<p>the lincoln assassin conspirators escape to britain <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=14m5s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=14m5s</a></p>

<p>quote from Lincoln&#39;s economic advisors who had directly challenged the British east India &quot;free Trade&quot; policy with protectionism which the british corporation HAD to stop <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=15m31s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=15m31s</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=16m03s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=16m03s</a></p>

<p>in 1876 American military engineers export around the world the idea of tariiffs and internal development of nations to defeat the British East India company&#39;s &quot;free trade&quot; exploitation of the world. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=23m51s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=23m51s</a></p>

<p>William McKinley later assasinated as president by the British for his anti &quot;free trade&quot; exploitation policy quotes as a congressmen the need to challenge British empire and its &quot;free trade&quot; which exploits every nation. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=26m20s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=26m20s</a></p>

<p>why this was a threat to the British East India company&#39;s owners who propped up the British empire <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=28m15s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=28m15s</a></p>

<p>Germany&#39;s Bismark also had to be eliminated by the British because he took up the policies of trade barriers and internal nation development to thwart the British East India world domination <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=32m48s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=32m48s</a> Bismark pushed out for it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=35m01s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=35m01s</a></p>

<p>all nations following USA example of tradebarriers against British East India company are targeted by British <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=36m01s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=36m01s</a> including French leader assassinated <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=36m06s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=36m06s</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=37m30s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=37m30s</a></p>

<p>President Mckinley explains in a speech his direct support of Protectionism and stands against the British world exploitation plan and draws British spies against him who would later assassinate him. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=37m45s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=37m45s</a></p>

<p>Mckinley&#39;s vice president dies and is replaced by a British supported candidate for President Teddy Roosevelt who had explicit British ties <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=39m34s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=39m34s</a></p>

<p>Mckinley makes a speech about a worldwide rail network that would challenge The British East India companies trade domination and is killed the next day by a man directly associated with goldman who admits it was London who directed the whole plot. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=41m02s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=41m02s</a></p>

<p>This leaves Teddy Roosevelt as President which as we saw earlier was a British East India company sympathizer</p>

<p>British funded bankers take over the Republican and Democratic parties in the USA and install Hoover and try to prevent FD roosevelt&#39;s election <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=53m08s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=53m08s</a></p>

<p>Rascob takes over the Democratic party by bailing them out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=54m03s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=54m03s</a></p>

<p>Rascob tries to keep FRanklin roosevelt from winning inthe Democratic convention <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=58m00s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=58m00s</a></p>

<p>Roosevelt responds to the subversive interests and directly speaks agaisnt them in the party convention by telegram <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=60m43s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=60m43s</a></p>

<p>FDR had knowledge of the ill influence of the British free trade corporate oligopoly from his youth and even worte a paper about it Re founding father Hamilton. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=62m48s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=62m48s</a></p>

<p>FDR address the democratic convention of 1928 and directly addresses the problem of international corporations subverting the democracy of the USA.(WOW) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=67m40s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=67m40s</a></p>

<p>prohibition repeal was an attempt to break up the democratic party coalition to prevent FDR from being elected President</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=69m32s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=69m32s</a></p>

<p>Roosevelt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=70m38s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=70m38s</a></p>

<p>Roosevelt speaks out against British tories and royalists who should have been run out of the country after the Revolution and directly &quot;trickle down&quot; type economics as their policies <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=74m22s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=74m22s</a></p>

<p>after winning the election but before his inauguration another &quot;anarchist&quot; shots at roosevelt to kill him before he can take office. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=76m00s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=76m00s</a></p>

<p>the banker&#39;s democrat, Raskob, later helps to instigate an insurrection and overthrow of FDR <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=80m20s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=80m20s</a></p>

<p>Roosevelt speaks out against royalists after the coup plot is discovered <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=82m35s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=82m35s</a></p>

<p>FD Roosevelts son(who was always at his fathers side in meetings with Churchill) talks about his father President Roosevelts fight against Churchill&#39;s desire to continue british corporate imperilist exploitation of the world after the end of WW2. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=85m00s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=85m00s</a></p>

<p>Roosevelts spoke DIRECTLY of the errors of imperialists and their shortsighted view of wealth and they tell off Churchill and compares British imperialism to the evils of dictatorship <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=86m41s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=86m41s</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=88m00s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=88m00s</a></p>

<p>and directly addresses churchill about ending British exploitive world trade agreements and calls it 18th century mothods <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=90m00s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgcdRCWEt4Q#t=90m00s</a></p>

<p>lots more at the end.</p>

<p>When FDR died however the british corporat eman Wilson again worked for corporate Free trade and the suppression of individual national self development.</p>

<p>I have to say this documentary is rather staggering and explains a lot of otherwise unexplained assasinations and a pattern of planned divisions and insurrections around the world whenever the British East India world wide corporate hegemony is challenged by leaders who prefer their own countries self development under protection from cheap foreingn goods.</p>

<p>(rememeber even first President George Washington who afterall directly literally fought Britain installed protectionist trade barriers to ensure the USA woudl grow it&#39;s own industries and not be a sefrvant of worldwide British corporate oligopolies.)</p>

<p>I also have to say that while this is put together by someone who has always seemed like a nutcase to me - Linden LaRouche - it is hard to argue with the direct quotes from the historical individuals and the named conspirators inthe assasinations that he presents here. Perhaps Larouche has finally hit on a real story worth telling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow that is something very new. I look forward to reading on this (you gave a lot of links). I knew about their hand with a large mercenary army controlling the Asia trade. Like enslaving for coffee plantations, Tea plantations and Opium. Then causing a war in China over such. Then enslaving Polynesians for copra.</p>

<p>Pretty much an evil empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish this was true, it would be nice to think of ourselves as running the world instead of being an over-crowded clapped out country. But it&#39;s a fantasy, a long held fantasy of perfidious Albion that has been trotted out for 200 years and is merely picked up by nuts like LaRouche. He&#39;s behind the game though. The real fun about Britain lies in Icke&#39;s Reptilians. Long live Her Majesty!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The East India company is the antithesis of free trade. Free trade means me and you being able to ship each other stuff from around the world without violent interference by gangs or governments. Don&#39;t blame my freedom for the tyranny of the East India company, you are playing into their hand. Learn some economics before espousing collectivist rhetoric without even knowing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s post is Larouche/Tarpley bullshit. The British system of corporatism and government privelages to the one percent is the system Larouchies support. America fought to free itself from this system, and jeffersonian anti federalists clashed with hamiltonian corporatists who wanted it in place. Lincoln&#39;s war was underwritten by crony capitalist banksters like the Cookes. American imperialism does not advance genuine free trade, but neoliberal mercantilism, where the US dumps subsidized goods on countries and bombs other nations to access natural resources. FDR, hamilton, and lincoln were all corporatists who sought to establish a centralized state. The new deal was written and supported by one percent corporatist oligarchs like Gerald Swope and the brain trust. The NRA cartelized industry and was favored by big business. The 1933 coup was an attempt to make FDR dictator, not overthrow him. Read fact based conspiracy theorists, not disinformation shills. </p>
