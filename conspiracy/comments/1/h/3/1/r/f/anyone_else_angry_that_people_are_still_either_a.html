    <div class="md"><p>The people at the top are smarter and more manipulative than people give them credit.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve lulled the public into a trance. Everyone is too worried about money, their jobs and trivial celebrity drama to do anything. They&#39;ve given the public the <em>illusion</em> of freedom, democracy and security, when in reality they are doing everything to gain more and more power and control over us.</p>

<p>By making people reliant on jobs for money, people are basically slaves. A worker is simply in the power of another person, who is in power of another person, etc. Essentially a person can be controlled by their bank account.</p>

<p>By giving us the farce that is politics, people believe they are important and have a say in this world by voting. The only power people really have is power in numbers, but they don&#39;t teach us that. Segregate the masses with petty issues and pit them against each other and there will be no uprisings.</p>

<p>By giving us &quot;security&quot;, people believe that they are being protected from &quot;dangers&quot; like terrorists and drug users. In reality they are protecting us from nothing, and are using it as an excuse to abolish our rights one by one.</p>

<p>Proof of a 9/11 conspiracy could be leaked tomorrow and nothing would probably change. We are already halfway to slavery. By using clever deception and taking our rights away slowly, people won&#39;t realise how badly the government is fucking them (if ever) until they are living in a full-blown &#39;Big Brother&#39; police state, in which case it will probably be too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>totally, this is exactly whats going on, just listen to the mind numbing static that is coming from the radio and television, it has no relevance it is confusing and strange, but people seem to be buying into it. Like you said people are in some sort of trance. I look around everyday and see people so entranced in their iphones and smartphones. like little children with a new toy.  they are more concerned about espn, reality television amongst other distractions to wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compliments for both well written summaries. This, with the statement by evoken1, made me think about another piece of the puzzle. I think it also has to do with people not wanting the responsibility of leadership or even taking charge of their own lives. We can debate whether this is human nature or inbred through schooling/economy/culture over the last few decades, point is; people rather follow someone who knows (powers-that-be) than to question it. This of course leads to another part in the human nature (I&#39;m looking at you Zimbardo a.k.a Stanford-Prison-Experiment) whereby power creates the need for more power. And I don&#39;t need to tell you the satisfaction that comes from power, if you don&#39;t have a firm grasp of reality and empathy.</p>

<p>Anyway, it got me thinking at 8 in the morning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I am currently in a managment position and I have been observing my employees closely after a few months. They always look to me for answers even though some of them have been working at the same place or 3 years. it has lead me to a lot of thinking about how people think and their priorities. Many of these hourly workers have children&#39;s and Iphones but are working for 8.50 and hour? counter intuitive right? Yes. There is a completely complex layer of social control that has been bred into the american psyche to bankrupt them to submit to the powers that be. lets look at the last decade prior to the housing crash. So many americans lost it all. but it was these same americans that lived paycheck to paycheck who were told to consume consume consume. take out the home loan or the car loan that they knew they couldnt afford, etc. and look where we are at now. militarized police forces, more and more of our liberties being stripped from us, for sale signs and dried up neighborhoods everywhere, food shortages, lack of jobs but increases in social welfare. they are starting the process of destroying our free society and bankrupting us to make it so that we have to live off of the system to sustain ourselves. this shit is sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad to see that people don&#39;t see the benefit of history lessons. Or else we wouldn&#39;t have ended up in the dreadful reality you wrote above. Reminds me of &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGk5ioEXlIM">The American Dream</a>&quot;, and how it came into debt. Our grandfathers/mothers waged war against Fascism for Money/Resources worldwide. Twice in the last 100 years. And people dismiss it for not realizing the other underlying reasons. They perceive it as a simple Right or Wrong. Good versus Evil. Without any notion of grey-area, critical thinking or wondering the reason &#39;Why&#39; it started in the first place and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW_rIdd69W8">manipulation of everyone</a>. Now it became a notion of &#39;Meh, doesn&#39;t involve me&#39;. Like they&#39;re bored or can&#39;t be bothered by it.</p>

<p>I think this is a social disease. And people should start learning, reading and discussing in the hopes of finding the cold hard truth we see. I&#39;d rather have the truth, even when I&#39;m not ready for it, than stay in happy-happy-land. Because I know reality sucks, but at least I get the opportunity to make it better, than to be told &#39;Everything is Fine, here have a Cookie&#39; and I don&#39;t see the changes I can make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you wrote is true.  I tend to buy into the hundredth monkey theory, though.  I think we humans have a herd mentality.  I think that for a very long time we&#39;ll all feel alone and isolated.  The majority opinion will still be &quot;giving a shit is boring and lame.&quot;</p>

<p>That is, until it changes.  Just need another couple monkeys.  More and more coming around every day.</p>

<p>Personally I am trying to just ignore the ones that call names or prop up ridiculous theories that what&#39;s happening is somehow good or normal.  Those statements reveal nothing more than the fact that a lot of people are sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve known about the 100th Monkey Theory for a long time and recently I&#39;ve been making personal changes in my head. I was angry, bitter, trying provoke people into critical thinking (in a soft gentle way, not the Alex Jones method), gave food-for-thought, teach people to have open minds, go into lengthy discussions with people willing to listen whereby I&#39;d always have the respect in my interactions (if they&#39;re up to it, and challenge them to correct me) and in general a bit of doomsday scenario kinda guy. I was mostly let down. People tend to simply &#39;Not Care&#39;. They weren&#39;t aware of the possibilities. A better future by changing now. They believe the lies held up by large corporations or governments. Doing everything they&#39;re told as long as they have a television, computer, something sugary-bad to eat and a world full of distractions. They don&#39;t know the general concept of what I&#39;ve written in my previous comment. Because they can&#39;t fathom the idea, or worse, that other people too don&#39;t care about the world and have only personal gain. Reminds me of &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Lie">The Big Lie</a>&quot;. They care only about their own skins. By doing nothing you&#39;re only making the problems worse. Until recently...</p>

<p>I came across this gem: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeFuc-qFKoA">Power of Thought</a> and it got me thinking again. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t change people, but maybe I should be the change. I&#39;ve already shown my physical changes by taking actions and being prepared. But I noticed for me it is a mental barrier I&#39;m slowly breaking down now. I try to say to myself NOT &#39;Maybe we are too late&#39;, or &#39;Why won&#39;t people change?&#39;, but transform it into &#39;I should envision a near future where the positive change already happened&#39;. I know this is hippy-talk, but it&#39;s starting to make sense and work for me. Slowly getting out of old habbits isn&#39;t easy.</p>

<p>The one thing for me remains though. A perspective issue. By changing this part of me, I&#39;m starting to ignore the issues at hand. I don&#39;t intervene directly. I look up only stuff that is helpful, all the while walls that take away freedoms are being build and the world around me slowly spirals down. Am I turning into something that is part of the problem, or will it eventually work out like the 100th Monkey Theory?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m rambling on, I think the RedBull is kicking in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hit the nail in the head. We are all slaves in some form or another, and nothing will change unless this whole system changes.</p>

<p>Our government had plenty of practice in the past to finally make us the submissive population that we are today. Strikes and protests were quite common in the past up until after the Vietnam War it seems. </p>

<p>So many injustices have occurred discreetly in my short lifetime, and no one makes a peep about it. Everyone just accepts these things as a way of life, for no reason other than be told so. If we continue on this path, this world is going to be a shitty, shitty place in a few decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I the only person here who doesnt look at a job as slavery? My employer needs __________ done. In exchange for doing that, I receive money which I can then use to spend on various goods/services or save to later spend on goods and services. </p>

<p>We have a HUGE problem of entitlement in America. People living WELL beyond their means. I&#39;m currently a broke college student, I pay my rent for the semester with student loan money (So, roughly $450/mo for rent and utilities, sharing an apartment) and my parents give me an additional $250 for food and a tank of gas each month. </p>

<p>If you earn minimum wage then that requires 28 hours a week to support. If you add the $50/mo for insurance in as well it still marginally bumps you up. </p>

<p>There is even more savings to be had, go into a 3 bedroom apartment. That would drop my monthly rent/utilities down to about $310/mo. </p>

<p>This isnt hard people. Make realistic budget and stick to it. </p>

<p>&quot;ooooh...I shouldnt have to slave away for THE MAN to pursue what I enjoy doing in life....&quot; yeah well if everyone did that then nothing of any productive use would get done. Sorry but someone has to be a janitor. Dont want to be a janitor? Pay attention in school. They key is to be really good at what you love and hopefully find a way for other people who love that to pay you for it. For example, making performance car parts. I would love to have a huge garage with tons of fabrication tools and build my own personal race car and go take it to events. My boss (summer internship) has mastered this. He owns his own business designing and fabricating motorsports suspension components. It was hard fucking work to get to where he is. Up until December when he quit his &quot;day job&quot; he was working well in excess of 80 hours a week between the two. It wasnt handed to him, he didnt luck into it. No. Over the past 12 years he has built up a company that is now finally able to somewhat support him. </p>

<p>TL;DR Quit complaining about &quot;wage slave&quot; and learn to budget and use coupons. Dont live a lifestyle you cant afford. This includes having children you cant afford. Learn to birth control or abstain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t totally disagree with you, but you don&#39;t seem to have a solid understand of cost of living.</p>

<p>For a living space to be &quot;affordable&quot;, you shouldn&#39;t spend more that 1/3 of your take home on it.  Minimum wage earners aren&#39;t going to pay federal income tax, but let&#39;s assume there is no such thing as state and payroll tax (which you in a sense are doing).  At $350/month for rent, you&#39;re looking at having to work 36 hours/week at minimum federal wage.  This is about right when you factor in sick days, holidays and time off.</p>

<p>So bringing home $1050 a month - $350 for your rent and you now have $700 left</p>

<p>let&#39;s say you are spending $80/week on food.  That&#39;s between $3.50 and $4 per meal at 3 meals a day.</p>

<p>$380 left</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$50/mo for insurance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Insurance costs 5 to 40x that in the US.  You might be on COBRA under your parents&#39; healthcare right now.  With a good job, your employer will pay a portion of this cost- but most minimum wage jobs will make you pay your own way.  Under Obama&#39;s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, some people have access to subsidized health insurance.  The budget is strained, so they are no longer enrolling new subscribers, but if you were lucky enough to have gotten picked up, that&#39;s $250 (this is subsidized). </p>

<p>So now you&#39;re down to $130/month.  We haven&#39;t factored in actually going to the doctor&#39;s ($100+ deductible.  God forbid you ever have an issue/surgery or have to pay for hospitalization/medication)</p>

<p>And transportation.  You&#39;re paying for gas, so you know how that goes.  It doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re paying for your car or car insurance.  Let&#39;s say that you pay $1000 a year for a car (way too low, but factoring in purchase price, tires, oil change) and $800 for liability only insurance (again, this is probably 30-50% what you would pay in reality.  If you live somewhere with accesible public transportation, then the cost of living is probably a lot higher (in my city, which is not a particularly expensive one- the living wage is $14+ an hour...)</p>

<p>So at this point, you are already in debt and the government is already subsidizing you as a fulltime worker.  Good thing you don&#39;t have any children.  Don&#39;t get laid off from your job because you haven&#39;t saved any money.  Hope your computer doesn&#39;t break.  I don&#39;t think you can afford a new one!</p>

<p>$50 a month for car insurance is crazy low. I&#39;ll add that if you don&#39;t have health insurance and you get sick, you are a generally more of a drain on the system than if you were getting government healthcare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, reread. I worked as a service adviser, not a salesman. I&#39;m currently in my second year of an ME degree. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ll probably have around $55,000 in debt from college. My parents are NOT paying for it. They help me out just a little (basically food, piggyback on their insurance as a driver, piggyback on their cell contract) Since I&#39;m the family underachiever (considering my parents degrees, brothers degree and him working on the large hadron collider...yeah me barely graduating HS was a proud moment) they have told me they would rather I focus on school instead of getting a job doing whatever I can. </p>

<p>So with my loans I&#39;m paying for housing, electricity, internet. My school has a required tablet computer enrollment class so I&#39;m set on that, but in reality I could cut internet and just not have it at home. And dont think I havent thought about it. Its not exactly a &quot;necessity&quot; </p>

<p>No, I dont have the most typical situation but I realized I just fucked off in HS, worked hard towards my interests, ended up getting a well paying job (for a 20 year old) and bought a realistic dream car, made my self a promise when it was paid off I would be back in school....Well, in a month I start my third year of my degree. I could have school done in 4 years if I would have not interned this summer, stayed back and taken classes this and next summer (I took some after the first year to catch up on math I was behind on since I had to start back at college algebra) </p>

<p>Typical, No. But I still very much have a very small budget and I&#39;ve busted my ass to be where I am and I take nothing for granted. To think I dont understand the struggles people are going through is asinine though. I&#39;ve been out in the real world earning $1-2 more than minimum wage. I&#39;ve lived pay-check to pay-check. Even worse, commission with a guarantee below minimum wage. My parents just taught me responsibility. I only use credit if its ABSOLUTELY necessary. (Car aside, that was to build credit) If I was making $60,000+ a year, sure I would use a revolving monthly credit for say gas, and pay it off every month. </p>

<p>Anyway Im rambling at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re talking personal responsibility while being qualifiable as a dependent.  I was assuming if you were going for an ME that you already had a bachelors in Engineering.  So as far as paying off your debt goes.  If wind up getting a $50k/year job and take on the amount you are currently paying for rent- $350/month, as your loan payment, you&#39;ll end up putting about 10% of your take home pay into your loan and you&#39;ll have your loan paid off in 10 years.  With luck and some hard work, you&#39;ll be making closer to $80k/year and you can cut that percentage down considerably.  You&#39;re degree is one of the only ones that is worth what you are paying for it.</p>

<p>At a full time $9/hour wage gig, you CANNOT afford a car and cellphone without assistance, where i live.  I suspect that when you bought your car, you were still living with your parents.  You also may be living somewhere that is particularly cheap.  It certainly doesn&#39;t sound like a coastal or urban environment.  </p>

<p>Living paycheck to paycheck is different.  MOST people do that.  Even if you are making $20/hr, you&#39;re likely going to be going paycheck to paycheck, with minimal savings.</p>

<p>Your whole credit ramble sounds like a kneejerk based on neocon talking points.  Yes credit is misused and given to people who can&#39;t afford it.  It is also something that you need to use in the modern day.  You&#39;re right that responsibility around credit is not taught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is still way too comfortable to care. Yeah, there are certain people who are probably in denial and will attack things that legitimise the things discussed here, but they&#39;re not a group worth worrying about. </p>

<p>The ones you should pay attention to are the ones who have no concept of real &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;; the ones who represent the vast and overwhelming majority of the American (and international) public. When those people feel they have more to gain than they might lose by taking action, <em>then</em> you have real action. We&#39;re a long way off that i&#39;m afraid. Most people see this as nothing but an overreach of intelligence operations designed to keep us safe from terrorism. This sub can obviously see the wider implications, and even Reddit as a whole is pretty sceptical at the moment, but Reddit doesn&#39;t represent the majority of the population, and we don&#39;t represent a significant portion Reddit.</p>

<p>And as soon as you see someone mention &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; you know to stop having conversation with them. As long as you&#39;re talking about things grounded in the real world, anyone using that term, evidently, already has a set of rules on subjects they&#39;re willing to discuss; if you mention anything outside their little bubble of acceptance, they will mock you and dismiss anything you&#39;re saying, regardless of it&#39;s merit. It&#39;s the same sort of meaningless attack as people around here who constantly call people &quot;shills&quot; or &quot;sheeple&quot;. Stick to the facts, and more importantly, don&#39;t attempt to convince anyone of anything - it&#39;s a waste of time and energy. I&#39;ve learned to stop having a stake in whether people give a shit about what i say; if they do, great, and i&#39;ll encourage them to read more about it; if they don&#39;t, meh, fine, i tried. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re crazy</p>

<p>Just like me</p>

<p>My heroes had the heart</p>

<p>To lose their lives out on a limb</p>

<p>And all I remember</p>

<p>Is thinking, I want to be like them</p>

<p>Ever since I was little</p>

<p>Ever since I was little</p>

<p>It looked like fun</p>

<p>And it&#39;s no coincidence I&#39;ve come</p>

<p>And I can die when I&#39;m done</p>

<p>But maybe I&#39;m crazy</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re crazy</p>

<p>Maybe we&#39;re crazy</p>

<p>Probably</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t totally disagree with you, but you don&#39;t seem to have a solid understand of cost of living.</p>

<p>For a living space to be &quot;affordable&quot;, you shouldn&#39;t spend more that 1/3 of your take home on it.  Minimum wage earners aren&#39;t going to pay federal income tax, but let&#39;s assume there is no such thing as state and payroll tax (which you in a sense are doing).  At $350/month for rent, you&#39;re looking at having to work 36 hours/week at minimum federal wage.  This is about right when you factor in sick days, holidays and time off.</p>

<p>So bringing home $1050 a month - $350 for your rent and you now have $700 left</p>

<p>let&#39;s say you are spending $80/week on food.  That&#39;s between $3.50 and $4 per meal at 3 meals a day.</p>

<p>$380 left</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$50/mo for insurance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Insurance costs 5 to 40x that in the US.  You might be on COBRA under your parents&#39; healthcare right now.  With a good job, your employer will pay a portion of this cost- but most minimum wage jobs will make you pay your own way.  Under Obama&#39;s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, some people have access to subsidized health insurance.  The budget is strained, so they are no longer enrolling new subscribers, but if you were lucky enough to have gotten picked up, that&#39;s $250 (this is subsidized). </p>

<p>So now you&#39;re down to $130/month.  We haven&#39;t factored in actually going to the doctor&#39;s ($100+ deductible.  God forbid you ever have an issue/surgery or have to pay for hospitalization/medication)</p>

<p>And transportation.  You&#39;re paying for gas, so you know how that goes.  It doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re paying for your car or car insurance.  Let&#39;s say that you pay $1000 a year for a car (way too low, but factoring in purchase price, tires, oil change) and $800 for liability only insurance (again, this is probably 30-50% what you would pay in reality.  If you live somewhere with accesible public transportation, then the cost of living is probably a lot higher (in my city, which is not a particularly expensive one- the living wage is $14+ an hour...)</p>

<p>So at this point, you are already in debt and the government is already subsidizing you as a fulltime worker.  Good thing you don&#39;t have any children.  Don&#39;t get laid off from your job because you haven&#39;t saved any money.  Hope your computer doesn&#39;t break.  I don&#39;t think you can afford a new one!</p>
