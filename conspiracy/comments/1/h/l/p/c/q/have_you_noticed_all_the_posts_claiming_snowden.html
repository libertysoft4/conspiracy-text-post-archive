Mostly because the American people and the world are now so infuriated, that revolution seems imminent. At first I was afraid that they had the military force to stand up against the civilians no matter what we did, but after seeing the Egyptian military turn on Morsi I have a feeling our military will have a similar response. The powers that be are losing their grip and fast. The Snowden psyop seed is a desperate attempt at damage control. I haven&#39;t seen a shred of evidence more than, &quot;his power point presentations were too good&quot; or his PR presence is too professional. To that I say, of course, don&#39;t you think the wikileaks team who I assume has been helping quietly and Greenwald know how to help him properly disseminate his message? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have stopped to think about that. Many times. I do find it strange that the media has picked up his story so strongly in the same fashion they did Assange but I think that&#39;s only because there were those that knew the potency of the information he had planned to release beyond what we know already. So those that were gearing up for it, Hastings, Greenwald, made sure it was known that <em>this guy is very important</em> for potentially for reasons yet to be revealed to us. That is just a hunch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite this being an op, that doesn&#39;t necessarily make Snowden the bad guy.  As has been discussed elsewhere, he could have easily be put in the position he was in <em>because</em> someone knew based on his personality type that he would blow the whistle.  This works very well because then Snowden doesn&#39;t have to lie, he is a genuine whistleblower, and yet the establishment still gets the results they want, whether that be cowing the public into self-censorship or rising up in rebellion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed OP. The authorities will try a number of ways of discrediting a whistleblower. First they will try to complete ignore him/her - pretend they <em>a non-person</em>. If that fails, they will <em>deny</em> the information, accusing him of being <em>a liar</em>. If the evidence is too strong, they will accuse the whistleblower of being <em>a traitor</em>, and if they can unearth any dirt on the individual he will be labelled <em>a criminal</em>. </p>

<p>If these strategies don&#39;t work, they will accuse him of being <em>a self-publicist, an attention-seeker and profiteer</em>. Finally, as with Snowden, where none of these accusations held any water, they will try to the partial hangout, and say he is <em>still an active asset</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any of these are true as regards Snowden.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an assumption I&#39;ve <strong>made</strong>. In fact, you seem to have a complete misunderstanding of the tense as I never <strong>made</strong> the assumption.

I never said whether Assange was a player or not, but the possibility is there and to act as if it <strong>isn&#39;t</strong> is an <strong>assumption</strong>. </p>
