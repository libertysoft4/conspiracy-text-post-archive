<p>Recently I&#39;ve been almost researching, watching documentaries, reading articles about what &quot;<em>really</em>&quot; happened on 9/11. A lot of things were really interesting and raised a lot of questions, but many things contradict eachother. (I guess that common with conspiracies, go figure)</p>

<p>What was the piece of information that made you believe this might not be what the government is leading on? If you believe it was an inside job. (Illuminati? Government?) If not, why/why not?</p>

<p>So do you believe the conspiracies? </p>

<p><del>I was going to put this in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> but this could be on a broder scale in connection to other events and conspiracies</del> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no doubt in my mind 9/11 was an inside job orchestrated by elements of mossad working hand in hand with elements of the U.S. government. The evidence for this is nothing short of completely overwhelming, if you do your research in a completely unbiased manner, you will find this to be the case.</p>

<p>Anyone who claims 9/11 was NOT an inside job falls into one of three categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>They have not done enough research into the topic (unbiased research).</li>
<li>They are too stupid to think for themselves.</li>
<li>They are a shill.</li>
</ol>

<p>It really is that simple. I would bet my life 9/11 was an inside job even if the payoff was only 100 bucks, I am THAT confident. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe our government would kill it&#39;s own people to serve other agendas, look up the gulf of tonkin incident. For years they stuck with the official story until word got out decades later that -- SURPRISE! We actually made all that shit up and blew up our own boat just to get americans to support a war! </p>

<p>You think they are doing things any differently today? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we have overwhelming amounts of evidence that the govt usually is incompetent.  And no good evidence that 9/11 was deliberately orchestrated by anyone other than Al Qaeda.  So I find it very hard to believe that the govt orchestrated 9/11.

    <div class="md"><p>Partially agreed. I don&#39;t like the term &quot;conspiracy&quot; makes me think of the Illuminati and people taking everything a person says and making it a bigger issue.</p>

<p>I think there is evidence that the people in Al Qaeda were not skilled enough to pull off the things they were accused of, but then there leaves no real suspect. I&#39;m on the fence with the government actually sitting down and plotting it, but some of the evidence makes it hard to decide.</p>

<p>Can I suffice it to say that it was an October surprise?  Manufactured.  There have been many tapes and even videos that have been discredited, at least in my eyes.  Osama seemed to get younger through the 2001-2011 decade.  His nose and ears change shape according to photos during that time as well as his cheeks.  The grey disappears on his beard, and at some point he got fat.  </p>

<p>Quite honestly anything released after 2001 has either been professionally discredited, subjected to intense scrutiny; but not confirmed, or through video and graphic comparison confirmed to be different people. All you have to do is a side by side.</p>

<p>My point is this, anything after December 2001, that was purportedly to be from bin Laden was more than likely manufactured as he was suffering from failing kidneys and on dialysis.  It is likely that he died sometime around then.  The Pakistanis have confirmed this and a <a href="http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fstory%2F0%2C2933%2C41576%2C00.html&amp;amp;ei=EjXWUbKrG8jQyAHkp4CIDA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHsP60GJ5NCxAx-R3vE_GtVJTn8_Q&amp;amp;sig2=jh-JE2eGtzpUXXjiya-0vQ&amp;amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.aWc">funeral was held for him.</a></p>

<p>Any authentic bin Laden recording release after this date is a compilation of old material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, weren&#39;t most of the actual 9/11 hijackers middle-class types ?  From <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/akhwaja/media/madrassa/NYTimes.htm">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/akhwaja/media/madrassa/NYTimes.htm</a> :  &quot;We examined the educational backgrounds of 75 terrorists behind some of the most significant recent terrorist attacks against Westerners. We found that a majority of them are college-educated, often in technical subjects like engineering.&quot;  Some of them attended flight schools and learned what they needed to.  I see no reason to assume &quot;the people in Al Qaeda were not skilled enough to pull off the things they were accused of&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They all went to flight school but they didn&#39;t graduate and their professors said they were so terrible at flying it&#39;s incredible how they were able to pull off such difficult maneuvers that skilled pilots can&#39;t even do or have a very hard time doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t &quot;graduate&quot; from flight schools because all they wanted to learn was how to steer a plane already in flight (and turn off the transponder, I think).  They didn&#39;t care about taking off or landing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see what &quot;difficult maneuvers&quot; they had to do.  They flew in daylight, in clear weather, and had to read the nav system well enough to find their way to Manhattan or the Pentagon from a couple of hundred miles away.  They didn&#39;t care about using the radios or obeying flight rules or air corridors or anything.  Easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be true, but they were still said to be bad pilots. They had to fly a 757 at 400mph like 10 feet off the group. Skilled pilots can&#39;t even do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, don&#39;t understand &quot;10 feet off the group&quot;.  Did you mean &quot;10 feet off the ground&quot; ?  No, they didn&#39;t have to do that.  They had to fly the planes into enormous buildings, in daylight and clear weather, in a slow descent.  Seems very easy.  I don&#39;t recall any witnesses at WTC or Pentagon describing any radical flight maneuvers as they approached the buildings.  Footage I saw of them hitting the WTC towers looked like an easy straight flight in.  The towers were taller than surrounding buildings, so no need to weave around anything.</p>

<p>And the flight paths look extremely simple:  <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flight_paths_of_hijacked_planes-September_11_attacks.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flight_paths_of_hijacked_planes-September_11_attacks.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77#Crash">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77#Crash</a> says the plane was down at first-floor level (where it hit) only for a couple of seconds just before the impact.  Says last turn started about 5 miles from the Pentagon.  Says at the end of the last turn it made, it was at 2,200 feet altitude, and went straight to the Pentagon from that point.  I see nothing tricky about that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll say that in that article, there is some testimony from an air-traffic controller saying they thought it might be a military flight, because it made faster, more dangerous turns than a normal commercial flight would.  &quot;The speed, the maneuverability, the way that he turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that that was a military plane. You don&#39;t fly a 757 in that manner. It&#39;s unsafe.&quot;  That just means the guy at the controls didn&#39;t care about safety or regulations, not that he was some amazingly skilled pilot.  He yanked the plane around and dove it into the Pentagon.</p>

<p>It is certain that regardless of the causes of 9/11, it was used by the US Govt. to wage the never ending war on terror.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was the first thing that convinced me- A building gets hit and doesn&#39;t fall for days, but in this both towers fall in around 10 seconds. An airplane can&#39;t cause that much damage. Look how big the building was to begin with. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get how nobody even questions about tower 7 when it wasn&#39;t even hit by an aircraft.
Mind explaining the last part to me? Sorry I just don&#39;t understand how the US Government benefits from an attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that seems like a pretty straightforward question that any college civil-engineering or mechanics class could answer.  If the govt story was wrong, zillions of professionals would be jumping forward to prove it wrong.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Mechanics_of_Twin_Towers.27_collapse">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Mechanics_of_Twin_Towers.27_collapse</a> says:</p>

<p>Both buildings collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down, though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides. In both cases, the portion of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed, which allowed the section above the airplane impacts to fall onto the undamaged structure below. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels. The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds. The lower portions of both buildings&#39; cores (60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) remained standing for up to 25 seconds after the start of the initial collapse before they too collapsed.</p>

<p>While the buildings were designed to support enormous static loads, they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the sections above the floors where the collapses initiated. Structural systems respond very differently to static and dynamic loads, and since the motion of the falling portion began as a free fall through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or 10 feet), the structure beneath them was unable to stop the collapses once they began. Indeed, a fall of only half a meter (about 20 inches) would have been enough to release the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the truth.  Of course we can never attain Truth as an absolute.</p>

<p>There are many different theories surrounding 9/11 as to what actually occured.  Some of them may have been planted as disinformation as a means to distract at least <em>some</em> researchers from the actual events and evidence thereof.  If enough disinformation is given out and the truth becomes very convoluted then it becomes difficult to sort out what the truth actually is.</p>

<p>The purpose of disinformation is to waste your time, or guide your ideas and reasoning down a different path than the one you were currently on.</p>

<p>That said I am all for investigating any theory no matter how outrageous.  I will find what I consider to be important information and make a judgement based on it.  For instance, I am interested in the involvement of exotic weaponry on 9/11, not so much mini nuclear devices, but rather Directed Energy Weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, they were right next to it inside the building. And think of how loud it already was around the towers from the crash, and an entire city screaming, and fire trucks, police. You can also see flashes of lights in parts of the building right before it goes down. </p>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t have to believe it. Everyone can have their own opinions on what they think happened. Just because I think it was a controlled demolition, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m right. </p>

IF it was infact thermite or some form of it that was used to bring down the towers, they don&#39;t necessarily create a &#39;bang&#39; when they go off, they aren&#39;t explosive, instead they are a chemical reaction meant to cut through the steel by melting it.</p>
