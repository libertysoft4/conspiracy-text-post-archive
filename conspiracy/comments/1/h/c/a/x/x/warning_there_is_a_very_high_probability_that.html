<p>The image was undeniably <em>soundly rejected</em> by the users and yet it&#39;s now plastered <em>everywhere</em> on that subreddit and being used in the corporate media. The implied symbolism behind this spread anus image being: <em>&quot;Hey government/police, come sodomize us! We&#39;re prostrating ourselves for you!&quot;</em></p>

<p>I tried to address my concerns about this with the head moderator, an account created just prior to creating the sub (it could be any of the other mods alt account) and was promptly <strong>banned</strong> for doing so.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/rH0itUU.png">http://i.imgur.com/rH0itUU.png</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Why would they feel compelled to ban me from the sub for voicing these popular concerns to the leadership?</p>

<hr/>

<p>One of the top moderators <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/search?q=author%3Abipolarbear0&amp;restrict_sr=on">regularly participates</a> in <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a>, a vehemently pro-authority subreddit that I believe most here are unfortunately familiar with. This user, who vouches for the logo creators from &quot;IRC&quot;, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1h025v/my_ruse_has_come_to_an_end_how_i_tested_the/">recently boasted about being an <strong>infiltrator and agent provocateur</strong></a> of <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> (which has been critical of the illegal spying since its inception). </p>

<hr/>

<p>Incidentally, the moderators of that same authoritarian subreddit were at the center of an <strong>infiltration/disruption</strong> attempt of <a href="/r/OccupyWallStreet">/r/OccupyWallStreet</a> last year, another anti-authoritarian protest movement. Coincidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Examine Kuwait circa 1950 and the CIA protocols for &#39;controlled demolition&#39;. Always remember that the intelligence community will circumvent opposition by introducing support channels they control. You can call me paranoid but this is just SOP. The reason for doing it is pretty simple: It&#39;s a lot easier to control people by supporting them and then directing the thing that they&#39;re supporting.</p>

<p>One does not joust with the best minds in social engineering without a healthy dose of skepticism. It is their job to mislead you and they are good at it. If you think you&#39;re paranoid then you&#39;re then you&#39;re observing the wrong person; you&#39;re not the one you should be concerned about.</p>

<p>Monitor primary users, word choice, message consistency, reaction time, primary participation windows, speech patterns. No one is operational and high functioning 24 hours a day on one account. Most people write with their own syntax and it will be clear if multiple people are operating one key activist. This will help you spot a damage control team and let you know you&#39;re being mislead. If you need a real world example then I&#39;ll refer you to Tatsuma who haunted/haunts a website called Fark.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ironic but if you see anyone that seems like a savior, don&#39;t trust them. Vet them as best you can. Snoop, check post history, evaluate writing style from a few random samples and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Not that these are amateurs but it&#39;s unlikely a damage control team is prepared for someone running counter intelligence. They assume you&#39;re cattle to be herded and that&#39;s the one advantage we have.</p>

<p>One last thing...be subtle. First off, you could be wrong and there&#39;s no reason to start a fox hunt over a squirrel. Second, this is the most advanced intelligence agency on the planet. Their hungover C game will eat your A game for lunch. Don&#39;t give them a reason to get serious unless you have to and never, ever make it personal. They&#39;re just doing their jobs...and you really won&#39;t like what happens if you become their hobby.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not playing forum whack-a-mole for right or wrong; this is your future we&#39;re talking about. Your freedoms and basic human rights. Stay sharp, think through what anyone says as to where it&#39;s going next, not what it&#39;s saying. Ask questions and take notes. Set your ego aside, play for the endgame and play to win.</p>

<p>The biggest problem will be containment after todays pacified are stimulated by too much of governments attempts to control everything.

<p>The government workers who are trying to control, within the Internet,  are being exposed to the truth and that will change their views and opinions even when they won&#39;t say so. Learning the truth will separate their  hearts from their orders.  They will obey their orders in a half assed manner and not be on the governments side when push comes to shove.

They know EXACTLY what it takes for people not to riot amd seriously rebel.

<p>for all the governments talk of &#39;security&#39; and defending of it, one of the prime reasons for &#39;govt&#39; is stability and resource allocation, when &#39;govt&#39; fails in that, as it almost did in 2008 with the financial crisis and govt&#39;s role in bringing it about by allowing the wall street crooks to disembowel mainstreet.</p>

<p>And this is the <em>very</em> reason why all of those things will keep coming in to the population all the while TPTB continue taking away the <em>real</em> things that matter under their (our) noses.</p>

<p>...and the people will do nothing because the bread and circus still keeps coming in.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t assume that the people will just &quot;riot and burn everything down&quot; if things start shutting down.  There&#39;s a possibility the people caould come together and organize themselves into a unit that works for its own betterment while simultaneously fighting against the controlling PTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  That won&#39;t do it in the <em>least</em>.  Hell, finding out that there is a GREAT likelihood that factions inside the very government of the United States killed over 3,000 people on September 11th hasn&#39;t done it, so what on Earth would make you think that revealing something as piddly as mere &quot;information&quot; would cause everyone to get up?</p>

<p>No way.</p>

<p>I think the only thing that would do it is if the military and/or police started going door to door and shooting and killing everyone - men, women, and children (especially children) - and it was all televised 24/7 for all to see.</p>

<p>And what do you think the chances are of that happening?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somehow, every part of what you just said seems unrealistic.  I don&#39;t think the population&#39;s been completely convinced about the truth of 9/11, and I don&#39;t think the government slaughtering people on national television is necessary for us to change the system.  I think this NSA thing is the first thing that&#39;s really struck home since the 70&#39;s, and I think people are still scrambling to get a grip on what it means, but can tell the government&#39;s explanations are bullshit.  So I don&#39;t really see this ending in anything <em>but</em> revolution - and I doubt it&#39;s going to be a violent one, too, because nobody seems to actually want that.</p>

<p>Of course not.  Part of the point of the statement that I made regarding 911 necessarily involves the acknowledging that many <em>still</em> are under such a deep sense of denial that they simply refuse to believe the truth about 911.  That&#39;s why I said that if something like 911 didn&#39;t wake us up enough to act (and it didn&#39;t), then finding out about any NSA surveillance, etc certainly won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Nothing unrealistic about that assessment.  That&#39;s just putting two and two together and reaching the logical conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was certainly being hyperbolic there, but I don&#39;t know too much else that would indeed cause the public to wake up.</p>

<p>I think this NSA thing is the first thing that&#39;s really struck home since the 70&#39;s, and I think people are still scrambling to get a grip on what it means, but can tell the government&#39;s explanations are bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly can one <em>not</em> tell that anything the government says about the NSA <em>isn&#39;t</em> bullshit without also being as utterly lost as I mentioned?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I don&#39;t really see this ending in anything but revolution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That or TPTB simply winning and the U.S. becoming colder in its totalitarian rule than Russia or North Korea could have ever hoped to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I doubt it&#39;s going to be a violent one, too, because nobody seems to actually want that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My man, have you been paying <em>any</em> attention to what TPTB do to people who even attempt to seriously dissent?  They beat them the fuck down.  <strong><em>IF</em></strong> (great big if) the population in the U.S. wake up enough to protest en mass like in Bahrain, Egypt, or any of the other countries presently going through major citizen revolts (which is <em>awesome</em>), then what will likely happen is that the U.S. police or armed forces will simply begin attacking the citizenry.  It will be like what&#39;s happening in many of these other countries, but on a much grander scale.  So as far as &quot;non violent revolution&quot; goes?  Sheeeit.  TPTB in the U.S. will see to it that it becomes <em>very</em> violent, because they&#39;ll start shooting civilians after a short while, and the citizenry will likely start fighting back - shooting back, since we still have <em>some</em> guns.  THEN it would become <em>very</em> violent.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is the only way things will happen, but I feel we&#39;re not all <em>that</em> far from a possible civil war in this nation - and I don&#39;t mean a non violent one.</p>

<p>lol.  Come on.  Seriously?  You really think that everyone who doesn&#39;t understand <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDig3Fu8WU">the truth about what really happened</a> are ignorant simply because they haven&#39;t heard a &quot;convincing enough argument&quot;?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW6mJOqRDI4">With all the truth that exists out there on the internet</a>, that&#39;s no longer anything but a complete bullshit excuse for people that are unwilling to realize what really happened.</p>

<p>The &quot;I haven&#39;t heard a convincing argument&quot; excuse is simply complete bullshit and doesn&#39;t fly anymore.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>that</em> simple.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course it does.  To someone who&#39;s in so much abject denial that they&#39;re going to ignore all the truth relating to what really happened during 911, I promise you they can come up with a good reason to excuse what the NSA is doing.  The fact that the truth about the NSA is out and yet the people of this country are not <em>really</em> up in arms and TOO pissed off about it is pretty good indication that what I&#39;m saying is being proven right.</p>

<p>This is nothing I hang my hat on or am happy about, by the way.  I don&#39;t WANT to be right about this argument here.  However, the fact of the matter is that we as a citizenry have simply done almost nothing in response to what&#39;s been going on.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not before a lot of bad shit goes down first and a lot of innocent civilians get injured and killed.  I don&#39;t disagree that the shitty police will indeed capitulate, but TPTB that employ them have trained and brainwashed them (and us) very well.  They won&#39;t quit until <em>after</em> shit hits the fan <em>bad</em> and simply KEEPS hitting the fan and THAT causes them to finally wake up and realize just how fucked up the side they&#39;re on is.</p>

<p>By that point, things will have gotten <em>very</em> screwed indeed.</p>

<p>All this is to say that 1) maybe you haven&#39;t been paying anywhere near as much attention as you think you have, and 2) we&#39;re actually on the same side and are ultimately not really disagreeing with one another that much.  We both have the same end goal, I feel.  We just have different perspectives on what will happen in order for it to be reached is all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That shouldn&#39;t necessarily be the case though.  A solid argument is a solid argument regardless of one&#39;s personal need to have it be &quot;more convincing&quot; for them or not.  Somebody saying &quot;I need <em>more</em>...something <em>better</em>.&quot; to the overwhelming evidence that already exists is simply, like you said, willful ignorance.  It&#39;s abject denial.  That&#39;s not a fault in the least of the argument &quot;not being strong enough&quot;.  It&#39;s a fault of the individual not being <em>intelligent</em> enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the NSA revalations are not compatible with even the most ignorant views It is simply too tyrannical to accept as a justifiable measure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the thing with what the NSA is doing, however, is that it can <em>easily</em> be ignored because it doesn&#39;t have any immediate, direct, and <em>discernible</em> effect on the individual.  Even if the sheeple are told they&#39;re being monitored, it really doesn&#39;t matter if you keep the bread and circus, dog and pony show of daily tv/job/money distractions going to keep their/our minds off it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not doing anything wrong, then you&#39;ve got nothing to worry about with getting monitored right?  That&#39;s how many think, so it allows for a <em>very</em> willfully ignorant mentality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people will revolt, and it will not be a violent revolt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, it seems, but not because of the NSA thing - no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The police will not retaliate unless frightened, because a clearly peaceful protest simply does not evoke the necessary environment to allow them to personally justify retaliation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That couldn&#39;t be more wrong, as has already demonstrably been shown by the peaceful protests that have taken place throughout the country and that have been met by things like <a href="http://technologos.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/lieutenant-john-pike-walks-up-and-down-the-line-spraying-students-in-the-face.jpg">this</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even agents provocateur will not be able to incite violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have thus far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a point where these tactics simply stop working.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  We&#39;re not even close to that point yet, however.</p>

<p>But anyway, that crowd currently is big on setting up honeypots, false opposition, and other dirty tricks. If it&#39;s just a hobby for kicks, they&#39;re just sick fucks. And if they&#39;re not mentally ill and it&#39;s a pro effort, well, it shows how desperate the jackboots are getting.</p>

<p>Like Admiral Ackbar said &quot;it&#39;s a trap&#39;. BipolarBear is a mod there, that ought to tell you a lot since he just finished bragging about the honeypot trap for racists he set up, then invited a number of people to comment in. Seems to be the &#39;in&#39; game fad among the ctard crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Restore an arbitrary protection afforded to us in a document that&#39;s designed to justify our oppression.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s controlled opposition.  It&#39;s ideologically boxed itself in as an appeal from a slave to a master.  This thing has been idiotic from day one - we need to abolish &quot;government&quot; and bring &quot;society&quot; to a state of peace and natural harmony, not keep fiddling with this bullshit system they built to control us.  </p>

<p>Our rights are meaningless as long as police and militaries exist, because their very existence means that people are being brainwashed into  being insane killers and thugs - led away from remembering what it actually means to respect life.  After all, that&#39;s what you have to forget to be a cop or a soldier.   The belief that things like murder and theft are acceptable, once sanctioned by the legal system the Constitution spawned - that&#39;s the entire point of documents like that.    It&#39;s a whole system of insanity, and &quot;Restore the Fourth&quot; is about accepting and strengthening the cornerstone of all of that insanity.</p>

<p>Anyone with a real appreciation of the problem knows we need to just abandon this entire framework of belief.  Wrong is wrong, and people doing wrong is like a wildfire that starts with the &quot;government&quot;, because the belief that their thugs start off with is the belief that &quot;law and order&quot; result from them committing crimes like murder and imprisonment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  People in this sub are blowing off steam because <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">/u/bipolarbear0</a> was posting racist content in this sub so that he could tell everybody how racist this sub was.  He went through a lot of trouble to discredit this sub and then tried to play it off like a joke.  The fact that he went through so much trouble makes people here suspicious of him and anything he is involved in.  I haven&#39;t made up my mind one way or the other about his motives, mostly because I don&#39;t give a fuck.  So in a nutshell there you have it.

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  That won&#39;t do it in the <em>least</em>.  Hell, finding out that there is a GREAT likelihood that factions inside the very government of the United States killed over 3,000 people on September 11th hasn&#39;t done it, so what on Earth would make you think that revealing something as piddly as mere &quot;information&quot; would cause everyone to get up?</p>

<p>No way.</p>

<p>I think the only thing that would do it is if the military and/or police started going door to door and shooting and killing everyone - men, women, and children (especially children) - and it was all televised 24/7 for all to see.</p>

<p>And what do you think the chances are of that happening?</p>

<p>Yep.  Zero.</p>
