    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad in a way. </p>

<p>Alex Jones was the first person whose voice I heard speaking out against impending tyranny. I was raised in Austin and followed him since around 1997. When he predicted the 9/11 attacks he got my full attention. But like you I have grown to harbor negative feelings about his entire campaign. He is extremely religious. He reports on invalidated scenarios as facts. He is entirely too angry and aggressive. I have come to realize that he harms the search for truth far more than he helps it. He has become the bane of the truth movement. He is basically the Bill O&#39;Reilly of conspiracy theories.....</p>

<p>What a shame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere in this video does he predict anything. The airliners as weapons I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s referring to northwoods which he still rambles on about to this day. When he mentions the WTC it&#39;s in context of the 93 bombing. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t prediction, it&#39;s post-diction and its the bread and butter of his genius business plan. Warn of impending woes constantly, when anything at all happens weave it into your narrative like it was a prediction and then do your product plugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t mind his religiosity if he didn&#39;t come off as petulant. His tone and style of rhetoric, oddly enough, remind me of <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>. It has the ring of rigid and unquestioning dogma. I get the impression that he can&#39;t be bothered with trivial things like theology and the symbol of Christ. </p>

<p>For the sake of comparison, when Bill Cooper said he was a Christian I took him far more seriously in his statement than Alex Jones. Bill Cooper studied the early church and read the Bible in context. When Bill said he was a Christian even the way he said it suggested that he&#39;d actually spent some time on it. As where when Alex says it he sounds like he&#39;s on a TBN infomercial.</p>

<p>But yeah.</p>

<p>Alex will take a claim and then report it as fact. That&#39;s the opposite of journalistic integrity.</p>

<p>He does talk about real things often enough, but I no longer feel like filtering for his bullshit.</p>

<p>O&#39;Reilly is a good comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let me get this straight. </p>

<ul>
<li>You appreciated that Alex Jones was right. </li>
<li>you do not appreciate his personal style. </li>
<li>you do not appreciate that his staff is unwilling to work for free</li>
<li>You do not appreciate that he has to make ends meet, and in order to do so, he has to huck some products. </li>
<li>You appreciate that he has not disappeared behind a paywall, much like Bill o Reilley</li>
<li>You do not appreciate his tone. </li>
<li>you do not appreciate the fact that he takes visa. </li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, I get that. </p>

<p>What I do not get is why that makes him bad. </p>

<p>I mean, just in my view, purely personal, he has gone a bit snickers, but that does not mean much. </p>

<p>I, as a single person, appreciate that at least someone comes and says the really hard things, and takes whatever pains it needs to at least get them heard, including making himself look like a redheaded buffoon. I accept that even though he sometimes gets stark raving mad, even though it sometimes is a bit embarassing to hear god brought up in that kind of debate, I think it better that someone at least has that debate, then to have that kind of debate disappear entirely because you can&#39;t agree on a speaker. </p>

<p>To end this with the wordsw of a wiser man then myself: 
&quot;</p>

<pre><code>First they came for the communists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a communist.

Then they came for the socialists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a trade unionist.

Then they came for me,
and there was no one left to speak for me.
</code></pre>

    <div class="md"><p>As a starter, apparel is among the easiest ways of making some money, and the most usefull. get a decent hoodie, or a decent shirt, and I will be sure to wear your swag in years to come. </p>

<p>Well, maybe the problem is not with alex jones, it&#39;s with your way of explaining things? 
check for the following signs: 
- do you approach uninterested parties with news about catastrophic events in the near future? That cauises the gut reaction of questioning everything you said in their first response to you. 
&quot;Dude, the banks are crashing, twinkies are extinct, and Steve Jobs performs in a tight leather combo for satan. RUN FOR THE HILLS!&quot;
&quot;well, my local credit union is doing well, I never liked junk food, and I happen to think that it is amazing that steve jobs came back from the dead, why must you hate everything?&quot;</p>

<p>Instead, try to recognise that ignorance is bliss, and that most of the times, there is a basic human right to be ignorant. </p>

<p>Instead, try listening to the conversations, and when they have a problem, or are wondering, interject with usefull information. That causes them to be totally stumped that what you said was actually relevant to their case, and will cause them to at least listen closely. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try to talk calm, quiet, and a bit lower in volume then your other side. oldest troick in the book. Scream at someone like alex jones, and the first thing they do is shy away. Actually talk calm, nice and a bit quieter, and they have to strain to understand you, at least a bit, causing them to become more awake. </p></li>
<li><p>If you happen to have proof of more dangerous stuff, layer your info. Think of it like talking to Reddit. 
12 page rant on reptilian lizzards infiltrating apple and switching their screens so they intentionally crack? Might be absolutely true, but the most likely response would be &quot;op is a fagot&quot; and &quot;TL;DR&quot;
Half a paragraph, that adresses the problem, and leaves the other people room to ask, and you keep that up for 12 pages? winning, most likely best thread of the year. </p></li>
<li><p>If nothing else helps, and they continue to yell: do not yell. Never show emotion. Just show them your nicest smile, while you picture them having their heads unscrewed by a band of hungry Zombie cannibals wearing apple nanos. Alex Jones yells, and pesters people. You drop actually relevant information, stop if they show no interest, are open for follow up questions, and are not afraid to change your viewpoint if someone gives you good enough arguments, all of that while politely smiling? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>People may just crown you their king. </p>

<p>Source: work in IT support. &quot;No, I am sorry that I did not at once realize that you would leave your stick in the original packaging, and think it was virus protection. Absolutely my fault. See, I can offer to send you a new test version of AOL that we only give out to the VIP customers, if you just leave me your email. Why yes, I allways smile like that, thank you very much. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, your reasons are sound.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that Agent Jones is COINTELPRO all the way and works for two MAJOR Zionists--George Friedman (CEO of STRATFOR) and Jeffrey Smulyan (CEO of Emmis &#39;Hebrew for Truth&#39; Communications).</p>

<p>Even a TINY bit of research into Jones shows the truth about him and why his CIA handlers/employers will NOT let him discuss Israel in a negative light.</p>

<p>Good on you OP. I have &quot;boycotted&quot; Agent Jones for over 13 years now and have been glad that I did--especially as more and more connections to intel agencies and Jones arise. I started &quot;boycotting&quot; him right around 2000, when Bill Cooper was very vocal about what a &quot;bullshit artist&quot; he was--and then, of course, because of his utterly ridiculous show on the eve of Y2K telling his audience that Russian ICBMs were inbound. I then realized that Agent Jones was &quot;installed&quot; in his position by people who wanted to marginalize the &quot;conspiracy movement.&quot;</p>

<p>He is nothing but classic disinformation--he feeds people <em>just enough</em> truth to sound credible--all while raving like a lunatic. Remember, Agent Jones IS the &quot;face&quot; that most people put on the &quot;conspiracy movement.&quot;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> how they planned it...it&#39;s a perfect set-up.</p>

<p>EDIT/PS--I recommend everyone on here either try Shoutcast or one of the front ends for it such as XiaaLive on Android. You will find TONS of alternative programming by people who are not fear-mongering ZioSlaves. Personally, I <em>love</em> the &quot;FreedomFeens&quot; podcast--these guys are all about liberty and battling statism...and aren&#39;t controlled opposition like Agent Jones! It&#39;s a shameless plug but they are really good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is simply the stepping stone, hes the guy that gets your feet wet. You&#39;d normally listen to him for maybe a month before you find other sources to get information from then you realize that he&#39;s just a fear pusher. I don&#39;t support his approach as I believe he his the perfect stereotype of what society deems a conspiracy theorist, at the same time though it works for him the and intellect he wants to attract and hold. Often when people mention him I will suggest others to go to and explain how he&#39;s just for &quot;beginners&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt this sub would even exist without him. Or be 1/10th the size. Overall he does good waking people, I don&#39;t think anyone hangs on his coat tails for long after they awaken. Once you get as far as the Zionists you are done with A.J.</p>

<p>The trick is to get the most out of what is there and leave the bullshit alone.</p>

<p>His reporting about the Oklahoma Bombing was better than any other</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you do not appreciate that his staff is unwilling to work for free</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true, pay them</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do not appreciate that he has to make ends meet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. Some things are outrageously priced, yes. But not everything is. And I said that apparel was unnecessary because you can&#39;t find a practical use for that other than being targeted</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you do not appreciate the fact that he takes visa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I do not get is why that makes him bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because every time I try to tell someone what&#39;s going on, the first thing out of their mouth. &quot;Oh your just another Alex Jones freakshow&quot;</p>

<p>The way he acts drags us down, causing unprogresses </p>
