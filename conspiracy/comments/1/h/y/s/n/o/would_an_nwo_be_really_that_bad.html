        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Even though this is a troll account, I assure you these are my real thoughts on the topic.</p>

<p>I am wondering: Why would an NWO be bad? One world, no independent governments, no conflicts? Have you guys ever been on &#39;special&#39; sites for gore and saw the gruesome nature of man? Beheadings, torture, people are burned alive. This is war guys and we (mankind) still fights wars.</p>

<p>We fucking learned nothing from our mistakes. US has the freedom to posess firearms. Shall I ask who has the most gunshot victims? There is no invisible governmental hand forcing the murderers to murder. They do it on theirselfs. This precious freedom didnt lead to anything good. Humanity cant handle this sort freedom yet.</p>

<p>People talk of &#39;enslavement&#39; through the NWO. But how is there enslavement when there is peace? What is left to be criticized if there is nothing left for criticizing?</p>

<p>What is democracy? It is the ruling of an semi-educated majority. IQ has a Bell curve. The fat part is the average. This average votes, but isnt neccessarily capable of understanding the &#39;behind&#39; of how things work. Bill the builder is voting on economic decisions. I doubt that Bill even knows how economics work. Still I will have to suffer because of the majority of Bills. </p>

<p>Decisions made by an intelligent minority would be much more preferable, because they have a stronger tendency to be &quot;correct&quot;. Stupid decisions made by leaders result of their fear of loosing power. They will try to appeal to the masses (the Bills) and enforcing Bills decisions (in a well-working democracy). An elite without the fear of loosing power could concentrate on philantropic decisions. Because they could give a shit on Bills uneducated oppinion.</p>

<p>Stop being emotional on the topic. Think rational. Think of it as greater idea. Greater than national souvereigns.</p>

<p>Of course only IF the NWO would be a real thing. Of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with a one world government is that the elite would have no incentive to be &#39;philanthropic&#39; as you so put it (not that the elite have much incentive now). Their motivation in attaining this dream, no matter how they may rationalize it to themselves, is power. Once they achieve their global hegemony, once there is no external threat to scare the populace into going along with their rule, they will have to rely on force to maintain the hierarchy: Brutal, unforgiving force.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the George guidestones are correct and, frankly, I don&#39;t care. I do know that a world governed by a single group of elite would not be a world I could live in, simply because the elite, in order to maintain their hegemony, would have to oppress the vast majority of the population. Those who do not subscribe to whichever ideology they wish to foist upon the gullible and unsuspecting population would be violently repressed (think Stalin on a global scale).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people in positions of power got into that position by being very smart and at least slightly sociopathic, this is a generalization but there are numerous examples to back it up (Metternich, Kissinger, Brzezinski, the Bushes, the Rockefellers, Morgan, et al). Obama was selected by the elite because of the success of his demagoguery, nothing more. He is simply a puppet, a used car salesman; put there to push their agenda. While they may be philanthropic individually, as a group they know that to maintain their exalted position in society they have to be ruthless. And they can&#39;t maintain such hegemony with the presence of a strong and well-informed middle class, lest they eventually lose power (much like the Louis XVI). They might build a museum or two, but they would have to crush any dissent and obliterate any class that could rise to challenge them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sociopathy is as sociopathy does. How many men went destitute because the Rockefellers monopolized the oil industry? How many people were murdered in the Bushes rise to the top?</p>

<p>There is no problem with Obama being selected by the elite. Unless you consider that...</p>

<p>The reason all of these problems are occurring is not because of human stupidity or environmental degradation, but rather because the ruling class (read: elites) want it to be this way. Corrupt despots in the DRC loot the country, leaving their countrymen to die. So-called &#39;Leaders of the Free World&#39; lead us into wars of aggression wherein many millions die. </p>

<p>The only path forward is to remove the ruling class by removing their state. There is really no other viable option, IMO.</p>

<p>Edit: It isn&#39;t an assumption that Obama was selected by the elite. Look at his campaign contributors.</p>

But I rather had some sort of theory in mind. I am wondering about the most perfect system of a state. Democracy isnt good IMO.

    <div class="md"><p>That is what history has taught us, indeed. But, I suppose I take it as an article of faith, that there will be one, final revolution in the hearts and minds of a critical mass of people, in which they realize no ideology is correct, no leader has the right to lead and no person has the right to initiate violence upon another. When and if this happens, there will be no need for a state, no need for a hierarchy and no need for rulers: Anarchy. Perhaps this is simply wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Communism wasn&#39;t a bad concept, in theory; however, in practice it was one of the most brutal, tyrannical and murderous ideologies ever known.</p>

<p>BTW, when I talked about the murders the Bushes had to commit on the way to the top, I wasn&#39;t talking about their respective presidencies. You should read up on the history of their family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are monkeys, at least in a genetical way.

<p>Do you see the problem?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That logic is circular. The answer is: Because we are morally imperfect. The ultimate goal of the NWO would be to ged rid of national armys and intervene only in regional conflicts (as there arent any global conflicts anymore). That kind of army would loose its conventional definition and rather be a police force. That sounds harsh but think of it as a minimalistic neccesarity.</p>

<p>No, I think your logic is circular. Here is my best summary of what I interpreted from your last post: Because we are morally imperfect we give morally imperfect people an army to control us because we are morally imperfect.</p>

<p>By regional conflicts, you mean rebellions against centralized control... this is the &#39;boot on the human face&#39; that Orwell talked about.</p>

There are some interesting comments from political leaders concerning the NWO. I cant see any form of comment there, indicating a forceful reduction of population. My question is (under the assumption that 500m people would be aquired &#39;peacefully) and ceteris paribus anything else also peacufull: Where is the flaw in my argument?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are these geniuses who are going to run the world and solve all our problems?
The trouble is that John Maynard Keynes graduated from Cambridge and was a respected economist. His work is cited in journals and his equations are used in computer models.
Guess what?
His books are full of dozens of macro-economic equations which don&#39;t work. The guy couldn&#39;t re-arrange an equation to save his life yet nobody checked his work.
Because of politics, people blindly accept his interpretation of how the world works without even picking up his book.
Most nations are run by people who still think he was right.
This isn&#39;t a failure of democracy, it&#39;s a failure of big government.
People are better left to their own devices. We can still give to charity, use a negative income tax for the jobless &amp; vouchers for schools and hospitals. Just don&#39;t try to make everything &quot;fair&quot; or try to &quot;help&quot; people who don&#39;t need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be bad in that you as an individual will cease to exist, you will become one of billions of cells in this newly birthed NWO macro-organism. What are the goals of this new abstracted consciousness? And to what end will it strain itself to achieve those goals? Your entire life is in servitude of this higher being (living in a dimensional scale above you)</p>

<p>Where as the opposite would be for each human to remain individual and go their separate ways in space.. making a divided cosmic organism that combats itself for resources. It will be an even more class based system with cosmic elites that have mech suits capable of destroying planets.</p>

<p>Either way, individuals will die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put on your idea but it wasnt the intend of my post. What would be bad about a collective conscousness? We are already pursuing it with things like facebook: You almost instantly know what someone else does or feels. If there would be transcendend unity and empathy this system wouldnt battle itself.</p>

<p>It also wouldnt be an existance of servitude to a higher being but much more serving oneself and the hivemind. Because individuality would cease to exist, there wouldnt be one individual whose servant you could be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with collective consciousness is that you&#39;d have to physically alter the medium (human beings) from their natural state and mold it into this system. It&#39;s human nature to want freedom, and as soon as you put a higher consciousness in the picture (especially a totally secretive one), many humans will feel their life is a lie, that they are a puppet. You&#39;d need to labotamize everyone with constant facebook feeds and that garbage. Honestly, I don&#39;t give a fuck what anyone on facebook or twitter does, it&#39;s meaningless banter. They could all be bots or PR guys for all you know, pocket all your donation money, feed you disinformation.</p>
