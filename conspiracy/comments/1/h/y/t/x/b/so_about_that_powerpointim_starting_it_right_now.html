    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re putting some effort into this. You should definitely talk about the Federal Reserve and the monetary system. For one thing, not many people know a whole lot about it and once it&#39;s explained it&#39;s easy to see how corrupt of a system it is. The &#39;Shadow Government&#39; really gained power when he fed was created, so I think it might be an important topic for you to include. </p>

<p>On another note, I&#39;m taking action myself along with a few friends. We&#39;re armed with sidewalk chalk and posters and we&#39;re gonna start leaving messages around the city so that hopefully another person or two becomes awakened. I&#39;m thinking about making an infograhic to pass on the idea to others who feel they&#39;re currently powerless, but I&#39;m not too well versed on how to make one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your previous post and was recently thinking of something similar. I was leaning toward an infographic of sorts but a presentation could be more thorough. I was also thinking having things laid out in a time line might be nice to illustrate the &quot;speeding up&quot; of corruption as of late. I&#39;m thinking visuals thrown in to show the magnitude of things will be key for people to really be swayed by things. People generally identify more with visuals than text. For example recently I saw a thing that laid out on a map the number of filing cabinets of information the Stasi had vs the number of filing cabinets worth of information the NSA has. The Stasi&#39;s was the size of a building, the NSAs was nearly half the area of the continental US. That&#39;s a pretty staggering visual. </p>

<p>My power is out for the time being and I don&#39;t want to do a lot of searching on my phone but ill try to hop on with sources for things whenever power is restored. </p>

<p>[The IRS uses your money to buy porn.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yay! Glad I could help.</p>

<p>If I were you I&#39;d go with a Prezi Presentation (prezi.com), to be honest.  It&#39;s free, it&#39;s public, it&#39;s already posted to the internet, and it&#39;s searchable.  Plus it is much more attention-grabbing than traditional PP (plus, since NSA has back-door access to all Windows platforms, it could be nipped in the bud very easily when it reaches widespread public attention.)</p>

<p>Also, if you decide to use any of the IRS scandals going down right now, I&#39;d probably throw in the quote by John Marshall:</p>

<p>&quot;The Power to Tax is the Power to Destroy&quot;</p>

<p>(from the Supreme Court case, McCulloch v. Maryland)</p>

<p><a href="http://quotationsbook.com/quote/38275/#sthash.IKLfGi3k.dpbs">http://quotationsbook.com/quote/38275/#sthash.IKLfGi3k.dpbs</a></p>

<p>visiontoamerica.com , mrconservative.com , theblaze.com are great websites for staying up to date on current government wrongdoings...  (the opposing side keeps them honest!)</p>

<p>Good luck with your presentation!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came here from Rt4, and I support this. I have a few inside sources, in which, I will not identify. Now, the CIA has done some awful things in the past year. One that I have a picture on, the person that shot the Navy Seal at the fun range was a fake person. The real person is living down in South America. The <strong>REAL</strong> person was a Muslim and if you have been watching the news, the government has been promoting separate race by....not promoting it. The government runs adds and stuff that requires everybody to live harmoniously, but when a White guy shoots a Black guy it is news and it separates the races even more. They have been trying to cover it up, they paid another guy that looks similar to him to play the execution role of the true killer, whether it was with malice and forethought or not. I have to find it, but I have a picture of both of their driver licenses, and you can see the difference. They look the same, but they are not. I personally don&#39;t give a crap about race, we need to stand together, it says that in our dollar, <em>Together We Stand</em>, but with the government separating us, they can manipulate the public. 
I want to help my country, and I wish more people could see the truth in this[corruption of the government]. Keep in mind I am only fourteen years old, so it isn&#39;t an age that you acquire this sad, depression-inducing knowledge, it is dedication to a cause. I am for it! Lets get everybody we can to help us! <strong>REMEMBER, IT SAYS IT IN OUR DOLLAR, *&#39;TOGETHER WE STAND&#39;</strong>*</p>
