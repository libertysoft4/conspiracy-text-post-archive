    <div class="md"><p>Ashkenazi is a genetic set / racial set.</p>

<p>Judaism is a religion.</p>

<p>Zionism is a secular political movement.</p>

<p>From a logic point of view:</p>

<p>1A.) Not all Jews are Zionists.</p>

<p>1B.) Not all Zionists are Jews.</p>

<p>2A.) Not all Ashkenazi are Jews.</p>

<p>2B.) Not all Jews are Ashkenazi.</p>

<p>3A.) Not all Ashkenazi are Zionists.</p>

<p>3B.) Not all Zionists are Ashkenazi.</p>

<p>An example of a non-Jewish Zionist: anyone on TBN. An example of a non-Ashkenazi Jew: Ethiopia, anyone? Iran? (Hint: &quot;Sephardic&quot;) An example of a non-Jewish Ashkenazi: most of the Ashkenazi people I know don&#39;t give two shits about religion. An example of a Jew who is not a Zionist: there was a big thing about this posted right here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a day or two ago that featured literally thousands on Jews who were specifically against Zionism.</p>

<p>Look at it from a logic point of view and it makes more sense.</p>

<p>P.S. This might shed a little light, too:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never supported occupation, protracted wars or the initiation of actions that will clearly negatively impact people.</p>

<p>Lobbyists should be held on charges of bribery and corruption. The politicians who take bribes should be prosecuted for accepting bribes and corruption. I do believe that there are cliques and that FreeMasonry and Luciferian cults exist, but they&#39;re more window dressing to me. The real deal is to fucking prosecute these pricks like the common criminals they are. No blood, no violence, no great bang for them. They do not get a glorious death. They get a pathetic death behind bars. Humiliated for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Your questions are those one would ask of someone who still believes in &#39;the system.&#39; I haven&#39;t believed in &#39;the system&#39; since late 2003; and even that was a thin belief. Since then I&#39;ve decided that the government that exists now is essentially Robert Anton Wilson&#39;s <em>Tsarist Occupation Government</em>. They believe they&#39;re above the law and I think they ought to be held accountable. I want to see that sly young lawyer in every freaking Grisham novel take on an actual issue. People are suffering and dying at the whims of stock-holders. This is unconscionable and I find it baffling that this is still regarded as &#39;acceptable normality.&#39; </p>

<p>At some point I can&#39;t help but think that people will figure out that they&#39;re paying the government to spy on them and commit mass murder. When people figure this out (it only took me thirty years) they&#39;ll wonder why they&#39;re paying for corporate well-fare and new Bentleys for already rich bankers.</p>

<p>Not at all. We&#39;ve quickly found middle ground with that last post. You&#39;re upset with the bankers, the military industrial complex and the lobbyists and corporations. So is everyone else on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not.</p>

<p>The Jews are not the problem.</p>

<p>Would you say that the entire Vatican is Jewish and not Christian? Would you say that Kim Jong Un is secretly Jewish? Would you say that George W. Bush is secretly Jewish? Would you say that the NSA is secretly Jewish?</p>

<p>This is not an ideological or religious or racial problem. You can&#39;t just say &quot;all people under X heading are evil&quot; without persecuting innocents. Are you aware that this leads to killing innocent people who would otherwise help you? Do you understand that this makes you a douche? </p>

<p>I think this must be lost on you somehow.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that or you&#39;re only a year into your research and collation.</p>

<p>While I agree that this discussion had been limited to Zionism you used phrasing that suggested that you tought anti-Semitism would be acceptable. Which means you&#39;re no longer talking about Zionism; you&#39;re talking about the Ashkenazi. While there is overlap you must remember articles [2A - 3B]. I would say that you&#39;re confusing the subject by mixing these groups as though they&#39;re consistent and identical sets.</p>

<p>Us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If any of you are truly interested in beginning to unravel the real history of our world I would suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carrol Quigley&#39;s &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;</li>
<li>Bernay&#39;s &quot;Propaganda&quot; </li>
<li>Billington&#39;s &quot;Fire in the Minds of Men&quot; (Advanced Reading)</li>
</ul>

<p>My personal favorite starting point:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQiW_l848t8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQiW_l848t8</a></p>

<p>Remember, no one is going to give you the answers anymore. </p>

<p>You have to use your own reason and discernment to separate fact from fiction from now on. </p>

<p>Just know, when you get started there is no going back. </p>

Just like YouTube offers insights into users posted videos, giving detailed analytics of where traffic enters (ie, Organic Search, link referral from Twitter, etc) I feel that a similar glimpse into links posted here on Redditt would help users who post links understand, and maximize inbound traffic to help grow this community (and all communities here) insightfully.  </p>

<p>The last time I remember it rearing its head was some months ago. I called out <a href="/u/tttt0tttt">/u/tttt0tttt</a> and he got really quiet afterward. There was another guy that went by something like &#39;humblebumblebug&#39; or something. He also grew quiet. They were the two most vocal. </p>

<p>As for right now - I haven&#39;t noticed too much other than a the normal rumblings that you&#39;d expect. I&#39;m very sure I&#39;ve seen some recently, I just don&#39;t bother responding unless it&#39;s extra fucked up. You can&#39;t really waste your time on idiots and so I try not to allow myself to get upset by them.</p>
