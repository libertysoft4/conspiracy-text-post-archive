    <div class="md"><p>A few fines where handed out. Last I heard of it was in the UK when parliment got together to debate whether to hold a public or private investigation into the scandal. Evidence dictated that the crime was given the go ahead after permission from &#39;whitehall&#39; refering to the government. So of course the government got to decide how to investigate the crime that lead back to them and went for the private option and we havn&#39;t heard anything since.</p>

<p>Edit: Correction, a few traders are facing criminal charges. So a few low level people are suppose to have been behind the biggest financial scam in the history of the world involving 12 global banks? Seems legit, back to sleep people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was never going to be a big deal... the journalist that broke the story tried to tell us it was huge, but I never bought into this one - simply because it is so complicated and boring, that almost no-one will care. I tried a couple of times to figure it all out and understand why it was such a big deal, but after a lot of reading I found no real explanation that made me feel in the slightest bit outraged. A friend of mine was telling me that this was going to be a big deal - I asked him to explain it to me and he just muttered something about interest rates and then admitted that he didn&#39;t understand it. I&#39;m not saying that any of us are stupid, but I highly doubt that many of us really understand this issue either.</p>
