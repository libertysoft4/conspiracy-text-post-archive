        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When it becomes impossible for a civilian population to change the system, through both non violent or violent means, it becomes possible for the people in control to do <em>anything they please.</em> Do you want to live at the mercy of the 1%? <strong>Do you want people who give no thought to human life to completely control yours?</strong></p>

<p>It is becoming clear to anyone paying attention that we will soon reach a point of no return, where it will be too late to stop what is coming. </p>

<p>Freedoms are being eroded and the internet is not only being clamped down on, but is becoming just as agenda driven and propaganda filled as TV. </p>

<p>Many people are waking up to the truth, and r/conspiracy has seen a lot more popularity lately, but it is still nowhere near enough. Things are moving far more quickly then most of us realize. </p>

<p>The average person in the USA still receives 100% of their news and information from mainstream media. They have literally no idea what is happening behind the scenes. They vote as part of either the &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;red&quot; team, cheering on the political competitors in a patriotic fervor, yet unlike the real sports which they usually have almost encyclopedic knowledge of, they know very little about politics, and care even less. </p>

<p>They have been repeatedly told since birth that the current system - A democracy that is really a Corporatocracy, which operates more like an Oligarchy - is the best and only system possible. </p>

<p>How many times do we have to vote one corrupt party out, only to find that the &quot;change&quot; the other party promised is just more of the same, before we realize the system is rigged? </p>

<p>You will never, I repeat <strong>NEVER</strong>, get a president in a democracy who represents your interests, only one that pretends to represent the will of the majority. And what decides the will of the majority is whatever the media tells you that the majority thinks. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t anything new. Anyone who has studied psychology knows that humans crave acceptance of the group, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sno1TpCLj6A">and will compromise their own beliefs and go with the majority as the result of perceived social pressure.</a></p>

<p>When the television tells you that &quot;everyone thinks this way&quot;, enough times, you begin to believe it, and align your own value and belief system with the perceived &quot;majority&quot;. This is why it is so difficult for people to wake up to the truth. Individuals are brainwashed into becoming part of the majority, by the majority itself. It&#39;s a kind of social, self perpetuating circular logic. Anyone who doesn&#39;t adhere to the views of the majority is ostracized and criticized, or believed to be insane. Anyone who does not conform to the current group-think is an &quot;enemy&quot;. </p>

<p>This trend has grown at an alarming rate ever since the 1930&#39;s - about the same time mass propaganda techniques were developed all over the world. </p>

<p>During World War II the U.S. &quot;officially&quot; had no propaganda, but were actually running the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_in_the_United_States">&quot;greatest propaganda machine in history&quot;</a></p>

<p>Do you think the propaganda machine shut down after its enormous success in WW2? Why would it? Think about it. Those in control had discovered a reliable way to make the population believe and do ANYTHING. This isn&#39;t unique to the USA either, and at the risk of invoking Godwin&#39;s Law, I use Nazi Germany as an example. </p>

<p>The German people appeared to not only be fine with Hitlers atrocities, but actively supported them. This isn&#39;t because they were evil, or unintelligent as many would have you believe. It was because they were manipulated to act in the way they did by an extensive propaganda campaign that convinced them they were enacting the &quot;will of the German people&quot;, that the war was moral and that the treatment of their enemies was justified. If any of us had been in Germany then, we would have believed exactly the same thing, so why are people so sure they aren&#39;t brainwashed now? </p>

<p>If history shows us anything, it is that the average person <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">can be convinced by peer pressure and authority to do anything. Even to kill or maim others for no reason</a></p>

<p><em>Nobody</em> is immune to propaganda, no matter how smart you think you are. Every day, everyone&#39;s views are being manipulated, even here on Reddit - Regardless of whether or not you believe government paid shills are pushing an agenda here -<a href="https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=buy+reddit+upvotes&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">A quick Google search reveals that <em>anyone</em> can buy up-votes.</a> The information here on Reddit is really no more objective or free from influence than any other source. Even this post that I have written uses basic propaganda techniques. </p>

<p>We need to wake up to the fact that the majority is already &quot;too far gone&quot; to change anything by themselves. Democracy as a system can only ever be as good as the people casting the votes. There is a reason why public school doesn&#39;t teach people about finance, politics, philosophy and critical thinking - It&#39;s to make the population less likely to question what is really going on and less resistant to the agendas of those in control, and it works.</p>

<p>In other words - <em>the system can&#39;t get us out of this mess, more politics can&#39;t get us out of this mess, clinging to ideologies can&#39;t get us out of this mess.</em> </p>

<p>Those who know the world is heading in the wrong direction need to wake up and realize they are no longer trying to stop an authoritarian system being implemented -  The world imagined by George Orwell in 1984 isn&#39;t &quot;coming&quot;, or &quot;a possibility&quot;, as mainstream media would lead you to believe. 1984 and big brother already exists. We live in it, we sustain it. We are cogs in the machine that enable it, and we as a people, and a species enable and are responsible for all the &quot;evil&quot; we see in the world, yet we blame it on our politicians, the government, the republicans, the liberals, Muslims, the baby-boomers, other countries, the gays, the blacks, the Jews, the new world order, whoever, and whatever. ANYONE ELSE - to avoid taking responsibility ourselves. We are doing exactly what those in power want us to do. </p>

<p><strong>All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.</strong></p>

<p>Humanity created this monster, and humanity must defeat it. </p>

<p>We can no longer afford to divide ourselves over irrelevant, petty issues. We can no longer afford to sit idly by hoping that others will do what we know we should be doing. We can&#39;t assume that others will put in the effort, and take the risks for us. </p>

<p>We have a choice now, but we will not have it in the future if we continue to do nothing. </p>

<p>Everyone needs to spread the word. Everyone needs to educate those in their community. </p>

<p>We must resist propaganda and collectively Downvote and speak out against anyone and everything that seeks to reinforce the status quo and distract the population - wherever it be online or real life. </p>

<p>We must promote and spread individuality, new ideas and unpopular opinions, whether we personally agree with them or not. </p>

<p>We must resist the urge to spend all of our free time on meaningless distractions - TV, sport, video games, movies, <em>Reddit</em>...etc</p>

<p>We must organize. Individually we have no power, together we have some. </p>

<p>History is decided by the minority enacting its will on the majority. Positive change <em>never</em> comes from the majority, which always has to be dragged, kicking and screaming towards progress. </p>

<p>You are not yet powerless, you posses the greatest weapon in history - human imagination. </p>

<p><strong>Do whatever you can, because time is running out</strong>  </p>

<p>If anyone would like to discuss this further or take actual steps towards progress, I have created a subreddit [<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/1984isreality/">www.reddit.com/r/1984isreality/</a>]</p>

<p>Tl:DR : Yes, I know this is a long read, but if your attention span isn&#39;t even long enough to take a few minutes to read this, then there really is no hope for humanity. Read it. </p>

<p>So very true. I took the trouble to read your essay and it was time well spent. Thank you. When you say the public school system is failing children by not teaching them critical thinking skills etc, you might add that many state education committees are seeking to fill this intellectual void with fundamentalist Christian creationism. It&#39;s a point worth making that children aren&#39;t just being left in a vacuum – their minds are being filled with religious-based pseudoscience and a twisted moral perspective which teaches them to fear anything and anyone they don&#39;t understand. They are not taught how to think; they are told WHAT to think.</p>

<p>I&#39;d disagree on one point you made regarding downvoting. Speak out against the problems, but don&#39;t try to stifle open debate by downvoting answers you don&#39;t agree with. Construct a robust rebuttal and keep the fight public. Win the debate! For every person who contributes to a thread there are dozens, perhaps hundreds, who will read both sides of the argument with an undecided mind. They are the people you should be talking to, not the vocal opposition whose minds are set.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Despite what the administrators of reddit.com would have us believe the up and down &quot;votes&quot; are, in fact, agree and disagree buttons. It has been that way in all the almost 5 years I have been member. So, I don&#39;t place too much stock in being down voted. This usually (unless I am being a complete moron) means that someone read what I wrote and was at least thinking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with that is that once a post gets enough downvotes it drops off the radar and no longer shows in the messages, so downvoting is a way of stifling free speech.

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. And this the very reason the vote counts aren&#39;t displayed for a certain period of time on most subs now (<a href="/r/rconspiracy">/r/rconspiracy</a> appears to be one hour).

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a good reason for minimising messages which have been downvoted? It seems to me that this is so open to abuse and so easy to game with a few like-minded friends or alts.

I guess I should be putting this question to the mods, but as you been here for some while you probably know the answer.</p>

<p>Are you implying removing the ability to down vote for everybody (at least in this sub) ? If so, that would be a great idea. Or are you suggesting that I, personally, could arrange it so that no one could down vote me (and likewise for other users) ?</p>

<p>And, if so, could you explain a little about how this might be accomplished ? I have often wanted to learn to program this site. Like when I want to clean out my old messages have them batch deleted rather then having to delete them one by one. Interesting. By the way, I use RES in Firefox, if that means anything.</p>

<p>You are quite correct that over zealous down voting is suppressing things that need to be read, especially when politically touchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean that you can actual remove the downvote button from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>for example like i did in <a href="/r/UNagenda21">/r/UNagenda21</a>.</p>

<p>CSS Code:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.arrow.down, .comment .arrow.down {<br/>
       visibility: hidden;<br/>
       display: none<br/>
} </p>

<p>Its a change in the CSS code where you can customize your subreddit as moderator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously I realize the contradiction of being for freedom, but also wanting to stifle opposing views. But I think you misunderstand me. </p>

<p>I am not suggesting the down-vote button be used simply on things you disagree with. (even though evidence would suggest this is all it is used for on Reddit). </p>

<p>I am suggesting that when you see a video, or read an article, or comment - instead of asking yourself what you personally think about it, ask yourself what other people will think about it. &quot;What effect does this comment have on the collective consciousness of humanity?&quot;. &quot;How will it change the way an average reader thinks after they have read it?&quot;</p>

<p>Ideas spread in ways we can&#39;t even imagine. Even if just one person reads what you write, you have changed the course of their life dramatically. </p>

<p>Do you want this article seen by more people? Does this article help promote individuality, freedom and ideals you live for? Or does it serve closed mindedness, repression and the status quo. </p>

<p>This is a war of the mind, and we have to get used to manipulating our environments, for the benefits of ourselves, and others - whether they like it or not. </p>

<p>The truth isn&#39;t enough. We live in a society bombarded by different views, distractions and lies. We must make this truth stand out.</p>

While I don&#39;t mean to sound pessimistic, I am convinced of the inevitability that economic collapse and martial law are right around the corner. There are too many indicators of this. Such as the heavy handed actions of the Police (for the most part). In years past the Police have never been this militaristic.</p>

<p>At a loss as to how to effectively wake up?  I&#39;m not sure if this is what you mean, but if it is, well...you just keep <em>trying</em> to wake up; keep educating yourself, keep having open eyes, an open mind, and investigating.  I imagine this might <em>not</em> be what you mean because I think you might be awake enough at this point.</p>

<p>If, however, you&#39;re referring to <em>others</em> - as in how do I wake OTHERS up - then...well, I keep using <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/StormCloudsGathering">Storm Clouds Gathering</a> as a good example of one way someone can <em>very</em> effectively begin to wake people up without actually ever having to leave their room.  One can do many other things as well besides just that - demonstrating in marches, etc is also good, or just simply talking to people and having discussions about different things that helps open eyes and ears also seems good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will keep trying my best and hope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all you can do.  We all have our faults and idiosyncrasies, etc, but I have a feeling that you are one of the ones that are on their way toward helping others and yourself.  All you can do is keep working and moving forward, like you said.</p>

<p>There are many people who feel very similarly, and if you were to find a way to pool your resources you could find a way to establish the kind of environment in which you want to live.

    <div class="md"><p>Well i have a few possible ideas which require a ton of money to try and change the system:</p>

<p><strong>Independent Society</strong>
You create a whole new society self sufficient and require no input to function in terms of trading. A good example is something akin to the Amish community. My limited knowledge of them restrict my ability to be very accurate how they work, but from what I have observed, they have great social uniformity. They don&#39;t work for themselves, they work for the community. Everyone helps each other out. This society could start out small, but then using the great efficiency and rapid expansion tactics (Amish are secular because they don&#39;t try to increase their size or interact with outside) increasing the influence of group. You out compete any other organisation in what ever field steadily because there is never a point where you get bankrupt because everyone will chip in if 1 part of the system fails. This will eventually lead to a Utopian society which doesn&#39;t require the pyramidal system. </p>

<p><strong>Education</strong>
Slow spiritual revolution. Our schools don&#39;t teach politics and critical thinking and finance? Teach them. this can be done by building a school (which would be ideal) creating elite group of individuals who know the truth and should be indoctrinated to spread this freedom of thinking. It isn&#39;t required to have a school either, just being a teacher and using any extra time you have to create debate and raise issues which would plant seeds into the students is enough. </p>

<p>This one is probably easier to pull off than the society. Self preservation will kick in if the society gets huge and I could see the government using either martial tactics or changing laws which force the society to use money. </p>

<p>But if I ever have the money required to do this, I&#39;d probably have to bet on one of these options.</p>

<p>Trying to create a whole new school that&#39;s going to somehow do the job that current school systems won&#39;t is a nice idea but has many, many hurdles. Is everyone working for free? Who decides what&#39;s taught and what&#39;s not?

    <div class="md"><p>that is why i said it will require A LOT of money. Also i have accounted for the fact there will be shit thrown at it to make it break. Self preservation from powers that be demand it. Also you don&#39;t have to just &#39;take kids out for the day&#39;, you have a curriculum and some restrictions, but I am sure that you can teach kids a better way than they are being taught right now. Spiritualistic views are never discussed until later on in life when it should really be starting from any early age. You want to teach a kid violence is bad? Just imposing a detention because he hit someone won&#39;t teach him violence is bad, it will just teach him he will get a detention for doing it if he is caught. We need to be taught empathy again, taught to care. The school ideally has to start from the very beginning and build them from the ground up, limit the effects of media and try to make them aware of what it does. Concepts like consumerism taught early so they can see their desire for this or that brand is just manipulation. The hardest point of this is finding the teachers, they will have to be brilliant (level of &#39;dead poet society&#39;) because they have to do 2 jobs for the price of one. They need to teach kids how to live while teaching them how to pass exams. I&#39;m pretty sure this development in spiritual will be a ridiculous balancing act, you make them too aware and they won&#39;t fit into society and won&#39;t pass the exams (so the school won&#39;t last long). But there should be plenty of people out there, the reject teachers who don&#39;t follow the rules of other schools but are intrinsically loved by the students. If we could create a school with people like that, there is a chance. </p>

<p><em>The problem with this is, you will only be spreading this knowledge in your family tree</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>True enough, as far as it goes....but the word I have not heard yet in these comments is &quot;sacrifice&quot; (although it&#39;s implied in most of the proactive comments), and it must be a part of any workable solution to the paradox you pose.  You&#39;d be surprised at how many teachers actively support the idea of teaching &quot;critical thinking skills&quot; and welcome parent involvement in the class room: add to that how many after school programs are designed to promote that  critical thinking skill set</p>

<p>So....if you&#39;re on the side that feels most grownups are hopelessly brainwashed, the place to put your efforts IS in our kids....and not just yours.  Get involved.</p>

<p>To even hope to change the way others view the world, you have to begin by changing the way you act in it.  The question then becomes: what are you willing to sacrifice?</p>

<p>Part of what&#39;s got us by the cultural balls is our training as consumers. EVERY major institution, be it political, religious, financial, or corporate, holds out the comforts provided by consumerism as the carrot to keep us moving, and the blinders to keep us &quot;focused&quot; (distracted)</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some anti consumer manifesto....but your kids are being trained from day 1 to follow that carrot and wear those blinders. And my personal opinion is that one of the premier careers for imaginative critical thinkers in our existing society....is advertising. So when you set your kid down in front of the TV for some alone time or whatever, you may as well be sending them off to some camp for cultural indoctrination</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 18 and I know the problems you talk of because I have only recently, &quot;snapped out of it&quot;. The main problem I feel is that we aren&#39;t taught to care. For example I never even cared about the twin towers falling down, all I remember that day is that my cartoons usually came on during that time and my parents wouldn&#39;t let me watch it. Kinda shows how apathetic I was taught to be, they tell you to be a good boy or you will be punished. It didn&#39;t work because I knew even then that not all good people are happy or that all bad people get punished or even why I should care? </p>

<p>Also it&#39;s not about sacrifice, you go too hard and you will be hurt. One dead extremist is about as useful in affecting public opinion is as a picture of African children starved and dying. It&#39;s not about setting as example, it&#39;s about effective use of your time to improve what you can. Actually the more normal you appear the better off your ideas can resonate with the masses. So if every kid watches cartoons or wears this brand, don&#39;t ostracize your children from wearing it if they ever asks you. Just educate them of their actions. If you are too extreme in raising of the child, the farther they will push away from you in some cases. </p>

<p>Anyway we are in the cusp of a global revolution, we are more interconnected than we have ever been before. Words and ideas are more powerful than guns and bombs, we don&#39;t need to be activists, we just need to facilitate a spiritual evolution. </p>

<p>Of course you will have to push the boundaries to be able to change things, some friction is inevitable. But we are not in the position where this is possible, we need to be able to passive aggressively challenge the system, at this stage, we are still in the lower percentage of popular thinking. So best bet is just keep spreading the ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good response. </p>

<p>Heh...and I agree about your reading of &quot;sacrifice&quot;. I didn&#39;t mean it in any sort of extreme sense. My take is closer to the idea that we are comfortable, and that comfort breeds both the apathy you speak of and the fear of losing what we have. </p>

<p>My belief, however, is that an awareness of the relationship between our position as post-industrial consumers and the inertia that position creates vis-a-vis the kinds of involvement that so many are advocating will require some sacrifice....you can&#39;t spend part of your work week working with kids, for example, without giving up something.</p>

<p>And I would disagree about it not being &quot;setting an example&quot;, simply because the &quot;effective use of your time to improve what you can&quot; is -by default- setting an example, whether it be the way one parents or sidewalk signage that serves as a reminder to stay awake.</p>

<p>But your point is well taken: it is our connectivity that has the greatest potential to create change.  An &quot;activist&quot; is simply someone who is willing to &quot;push the boundaries&quot; (i.e accept some risk into their life) in personal effort to facilitate the change they see as important.  </p>

<p>In the broadest, simplest, and most direct sense, this exchange of words and ideas is an act of change, made possible by both humanity&#39;s increasing connectivity, and our individual perceptions of activism.  My way of aggressively challenging the system is to challenge little kids to to think, explore, reach their own conclusions, and work with other kids co-operatively to implement them.  That is a skill set I define as &quot;critical thought&quot;, and I don&#39;t pretend to know how that skill set will play itself out in their lives.</p>

<p>I just believe it will help to make them confident and self-reliant individuals who care about the world around them....and who are willing to engage it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that you&#39;re on to something with all this for sure. We don&#39;t even necessarily need to start off immediately with a fully independent society. We could start smaller, I really think that cooperative ownership of a business in combination with a plan or framework to achieve independence (in whatever way the group would find acceptable) could be all that it takes to get the ball rolling. Identifying common goals and ideals for achieving independence could be the first step. The second could be finding a profitable enterprise in which we collectively invested that was compatible with our ideology and end goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes even a small relatively independent group is enough, it&#39;s just the essence of creating a system where individuals can&#39;t fear for money is what I like about it. It has grains of communism which is problematic when trying to present it to the population, also facing some of the same problems. But that&#39;s why for the early stages it should be very pragmatic, we probably can have some lenience in terms of work load, but clearly under performing members of society should be dealt with accordingly. It is semi-integrated with normal society which is key, all other ideas I have viewed upon have cited unlikely change in mass morality or required violent methods. Both improbable as they require too many factors and the system is already in place designed to stop it happening and has been suppressing everything for decades if not century. The internet was possible place for a revolution, but now even that is getting clamped down heavily and I think will become the greatest media tool ever now so actually goes against us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I partly agree but what is the alternative to democracy?
I remember in my first year at university I shared a floor with a philosophy student. We&#39;d sit in the kitchen together most evenings and debate stuff. He started out having pretty normal views, but over the course of the year he came to the conclusion that everything should be run by a council of philosophers.
But you see, philosophy students know bugger all about economics, engineering, and a whole bunch of other stuff so how can they claim to know what&#39;s best for us. As Milton Friedman put it: &quot;Where are these angels who are going to organize society for us?&quot;
I&#39;m concerned that philosophy and history students are being brainwashed to believe that they are part of an elite group who know better than the rest of us.
This brainwashing is all part of a plan by a group called The Order of The Nine Angels who believe that life is a game and that in order to make the world a better place one must make it a more interesting place... by committing acts of evil.
According to former FBI agent Ted Gunderson (who died from cancer a few years ago), these Satanists have a lot of influence in the media and in intelligence.
The problem, in my view, is that there will always be very strange and dangerous people out there who would like to take control of the government. The president is nothing more than a manager for public life. Do these politicians really have the power to decide what the CIA or the FBI does? I wonder....
But at-least with democracy the general public has some kind of connection to what is going on in government rather than just blindly accepting whatever happens. It&#39;s so easy to say: &quot;Oh, that seems like an odd decision to me but then what do I know, I&#39;m not a philosopher&quot;
Democracy encourages people to look at what the government is doing, even if the real power actually rests with the people carrying guns.
The best thing would be for us to just have less government altogether.  Although it&#39;s good to have something there people are actually quite good at sorting out their own lives. Or, at-least they&#39;re better at pursuing their rational self interest than the government is.
