<p>Title: Medical Marijuana or Reefer Madness?</p>

<p>February 2008</p>

<p>By Deborah Cramer, a science and technical writer for more than 20 years.</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote:</p>

<p>“Medicinal cannabis is a useful anti-emetic for some patients with AIDS or hepatitis or for those under-going chemotherapy. Beyond pain and nausea relief, various claims for cannabis’ medicinal uses include glaucoma prevention, reduced muscle spasm, appetite stimulation, and anticonvulsive properties.”</p>

<p>May 26, 2006</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote:</p>

<p>&#39;The new findings &quot;were against our expectations,&quot; said Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years. &quot;We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use,&quot; he said. &quot;What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p>Title:Pot Smoking Not Linked to Lung Cancer, Study Shows No Increased Risk for Even the Heaviest Marijuana Smokers</p>

<p>May 23, 2006</p>

<p>By Salynn Boyles Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote:</p>

<p>“People who smoke marijuana do not appear to be at increased risk for developing lung cancer, new research suggests. While a clear increase in cancer risk was seen among cigarette smokers in the study, no such association was seen for regular cannabis users. Even very heavy, long-term marijuana users who had smoked more than 22,000 joints over a lifetime seemed to have no greater risk than infrequent marijuana users or nonusers.”</p>

<p>&#39;Explaining that the introduction of THC into the brain triggers a cellular self-digestion process known as &quot;autophagy,&quot; study co-author Guillermo Velasco said his team has isolated the specific pathway by which this process unfolds, and noted that it appears &quot;to kill cancer cells, while it does not affect normal cells.&quot;</p>

<p>7/22/2009</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote:</p>

<p>“More recently, scientists reported that cannabidiol, one of the chemicals found in marijuana, slows growth of breast cancer cells growing in laboratory dishes. However, this substance has not been tested in humans or even in animals that have cancer yet. Cannabidiol levels in marijuana are low, so any benefit from this compound would require use of a purified and concentrated form.”</p>

<p>Title: Apoptosis in cancer.</p>

<p>2000 Mar</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote:</p>

<p>“Among the most important of these advances is the realization that apoptosis and the genes that control it have a profound effect on the malignant phenotype. For example, it is now clear that some oncogenic mutations disrupt apoptosis, leading to tumor initiation, progression or metastasis.”</p>

<p>“Because the same mutations that suppress apoptosis during tumor development also reduce treatment sensitivity, apoptosis provides a conceptual framework to link cancer genetics with cancer therapy. An intense research effort is uncovering the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis such that, in the next decade, one envisions that this information will produce new strategies to exploit apoptosis for therapeutic benefit.”</p>

<p>May 1,2009</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote:</p>

<p>“Autophagy can promote cell survival or cell death, but the molecular basis underlying its dual role in cancer remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component of marijuana, induces human glioma cell death through stimulation of autophagy.”</p>

As of 10/15/99 this is now in question. On that date Princeton neuroscientists Elizabeth Gould and Charles Gross published a study in Science dealing announcing their discovery of the daily growth of new brain cells in the adult macaque monkey brain. “</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote:</p>

<p>“When I began to study marihuana in 1967, I had no doubt that it was a very harmful drug that was unfortunately being used by more and more foolish young people who would not listen to or could not understand the warnings about its dangers. My purpose was to define scientifically the nature and degree of those dangers. In the next three years, as I reviewed the scientific, medical, and lay literature, my views began to change. I came to understand that I, like so many other people in this country, had been brainwashed. Me beliefs about the dangers of marihuana had little empirical foundation. By the time I completed the research that formed the basis for a book, I had become convince that cannabis was considerably less harmful than tobacco and alcohol, the most commonly used legal drugs. ”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what the issue here is that you are defending the blanket statement (on this comment and the whole thread) that cannabis cures cancer.  That can be interpreted in many different ways, and a more accurate statement would be &quot;Marijuana helps prevent and delay cancer cell growth and metastasis with the right concentration, chemical composition, and treatment.  In some cases it actually diminished the size of tumors or removed them completely&quot;.</p>

<p>Still completely revolutionary and should be studied like crazy to possibly find a way to use it to treat and help slow cancer on a widespread basis, but not the blanket statement that makes it sound like a cancer cure all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While its proven to have some effects against cancer cells there is still not a form of cannabis to complete kill the cancer as disease.</p>

<p>There must done more research to extract the substance which is killing the cancer cells and synthesize it to give the patient a dosis enough to heal the cancer.</p>

<p>There are already drugs like dronabinol which have extracted THC (the main thing what make you feel high).</p>

<p>THC is only helping cancer patients to eat, having less pain and feel better.</p>

<p>The statement &quot;cannabis cures cancer&quot; is wrong because cannabis has only shown to have a substance which could cure cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are very welcome kind sir.  I actually did this a couple years, ago so there is probably more recent studies.  I actually got a weed ticket in a decriminalized state and plead not guilty.  And had this as well as full text of all these studies fedex delivered to the judge.  As well as a huge legal argument about how the declaration of independence secures my right to use pot, forget where that legal argument is probably hidden in my gmail account somewhere.  Lets just say I had to paid the ticket.</p>

<p>WHAT DO YOU KNOW ITS RIGHT HERE MY LETTER TO THE JUDGE!!!!!</p>

<p>I please ask you to take a fresh look at the evidence. There is the same amount of evidence for marijuana preventing cancer, as there is for evolution being a law, and gravity being a law, but conservative forces in our government will not acknowledge science, because they are protecting the profits of big business.</p>

<p>(1.) To limit my use of a plant that has proven medicinal effects, most importantly curing and preventing cancer, and also having no confirmed bad side effects, is unconstitutional, because the Declaration of Independence states clearly I have the right to life. The legislature does not have the authority to limit my life. I concentrate on cancer in my defense, since it is the worst disease to affect our generation. It has become a profit based industry by pharmaceutical firms who profit from cancer, not from preventing it.</p>

<p>Direct quote from Declaration of Independence:</p>

<p>“All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life”</p>

<p>“Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it”</p>

<p>(2.) According to this, it is destructive to criminalize American citizens for utilizing a natural substance that has been proven by numerous studies to be harmless as well as cure and prevent cancer, among other diseases. And further more all these people are in jail for using this plant, while all this loss of time and money could have been applied to preventing other criminal activity that is undoubtably harmful.</p>

<p>(3.) Understand and recognizing cellular processes, DNA structure, and the profit system of pharmaceutical companies is key to my defense. The profit based Cancer industry does not recognize scientific studies that would make the giant corporations that treat cancer less profitable. The pharmaceutical corporations and their lobbyists have become so powerful that I am not capable of a fair trial. I, nor anyone else besides them, has the hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on Harvard lobbyists. Marijuana if legal would be covered under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994. This act is out of date with modern science and 15 years of scientific progress, that has proven without a doubt the anticancer properties of plants such as marijuana, green tea, and others. If dietary supplement companies could legally advertise their plants scientifically proven medicinal powers, drug companies would lose profits. Sadly politics has taken priority over science.</p>

<p>Plants such as marijuana have been used as medicines for 10,000 years and cannot be patented. Therefore, Pharmaceutical companies have chosen to go purely with synthetic drugs and also chemotherapy and radiation, which can be patented. The only substances that can legally claim to heal you, are drugs, which require molecular alteration. When your body digests a molecularly altered substance it is a poison that damages DNA, damaged DNA leads to cancer. All the side effects you see on drug commercials are examples of this DNA being damaged.</p>

<p>Your DNA can be compared to a computer program and in that program is set of code for apoptosis, a cellular process called Programmed Cell Death, when this part of your DNA is damaged a cell can turn into cancer. Apoptosis is how your cells automatically kill themselves after 2 years or less.</p>

<p>So in our country only cancer causing substances can claim to cure or prevent a disease, even though the Mayo Clinic, one of the highest up medical authorities in the world, just came out with an additional study saying the medical powers of green tea, most recently that it stops leukemia cells from multiplying. Vitamin C in orange juice has been known to cure and prevent scurvy for hundreds of years, but legally orange juice companies cannot advertise such claims.</p>

<p>“...the National Cancer Institute in Washington has identified 3,000 plants that are active against cancer cells. Seventy percent of those plants are found in the Amazon rainforest. ”</p>

<p>Our news channels are reporting that plants fight cancer, yet our law does not reflect this.</p>

<p>This is a quote from the FDA website:</p>

<p>“Is it legal to market a dietary supplement product as a treatment or cure for a specific disease or condition?</p>

<p>No, a product sold as a dietary supplement and promoted on its label or in labeling* as a treatment, prevention or cure for a specific disease or condition would be considered an unapproved--and thus illegal--drug. To maintain the product&#39;s status as a dietary supplement, the label and labeling must be consistent with the provisions in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994.”</p>

<p>In Germany a dietary supplement can claim to cure or prevent a disease, and because they don&#39;t have a law like this they have become much more advanced in using multiple plants synergistically to heal disease.</p>

<p>President Ronald Reagan used extract from a venus fly trap plant, called &quot;Carnivora&quot; to treat his cancer in 1985.</p>

<p>A conflict of interest exists in the FDA, the leaders own stock in the drug companies and go back and forth working for FDA and pharmaceutical companies. Therefore they are not able to give a fair and unbiased opinion on marijuana&#39;s anticancer properties. A much more accurate opinion on marijuana&#39;s anticancer properties are doctors in the tops of their fields. A majority of doctors, especially ones in the top of their field, say marijuana is completely harmless and has potent anticancer properties. The FDA says these well respected doctor&#39;s studies are vague, well if a Harvard and Stanford University study is vague then every study in the medical world is vague by their standard.</p>

<p>Doctors already know about marijuana&#39;s anticancer properties, that is why they are developing new cancer curing and preventing drugs from it, so companies can profit from it. Although synthetic versions of natural compounds can have similar effects, but again synthetic compounds damage your DNA leading to cancer. The cancer epidemic in our country is caused by the over use of prescription drugs, which are synthetic. So basically they are creating anti cancer substances based on marijuana that will just end up causing cancer because they are synthetic. Also they want these synthetic cancer causing versions of marijuana such as Marinol to not have the euphoric feeling of marijuana, but that euphoric feeling harmlessly activates brain cells that are never used, strengthening neuron pathways preventing brain cancer, according to Princeton University. Besides from activating unused brain cells, it induces apoptosis or autophagy in all cells preventing and killing cancer, according to Forbes.com, Guillermo Velasco, with the department of biochemistry and molecular biology in the School of Biology at Complutense University in Madrid, and Dr. John S. Yu, co-director of the Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program in the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. I have a US government study also confirming that apoptosis is the key to curing and preventing Cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pot smoking community would gain more respect, if they just said&quot;we like to get high&quot;. 
  I doubt that it cures cancer. In fact from what I have seen come out of pipes and bongs, I seriously believe it can not be healthy to smoke it. 
 It should however, be legal to possess and smoke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are other ways to consume cannabis in healthy way like inhaling vapor,eating,pills or a cannabis extract tincture.</p>

<p>This should be obviously the way to go, if you are consuming it for medicinal reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, but nothing is mentioned about how it is consumed. I often see smokers praising the benefits of marijuana and my point is, just say you like to get high and don&#39;t bullshit us with the medical facts. The ratio of medical users to recreational users is probably 1/200,000. I think it should be legalized because it is somewhat harmless in light use, recreational settings. We shouldn&#39;t have to claim it is medically necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t claim to use it for medicinal reasons.</p>

<p>The thing is that without the 420 community medicinal cannabis would probably not exist at all today.</p>

<p>While you can make the argument that we are &quot;abusing&quot; the current medicinal cannabis system and the real sick people this not the case in reality.</p>

<p>Most real sick people wouldn&#39;t get their legit medicine without help from the  420 community or proper guidance on how to use cannabis.</p>

<p>Its a Win-Win Situation and i hope that we don&#39;t have this unecessery bureaucracy anymore in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the plant is illegal under federal law so obviously the answer is no.  It just cures cancer in the test tube and we know it doesn&#39;t damage the immune system like conventional methods.  It doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to extrapolate that information.</p>
