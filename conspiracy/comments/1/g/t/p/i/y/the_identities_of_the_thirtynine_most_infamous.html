<p>The tale of <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a> is one of great mystery, confusion, and self-loathing. For almost two years the SRS that we know now has been propagating itself as a sort-of Gestapo against freedom of speech. SJWs with a bone to pick, SRS users &quot;call out&quot; anything they feel is offensive to their radical-left view of society. I&#39;ve spent 14 months within their ranks, understanding their motives and their goals. I made my way into their inner circle, desperate to know and understand the women that I thought were some of the finest trolls on reddit. Once I found out the truth, I was stunned, and it took me a while to figure out what I needed to do. Today, I come to you with the real accounts of the Archangelles, their true reddit identities. These efforts didn&#39;t come easily, and I suspect they&#39;ll be quick to deny my accounts, but I promise that these are true. I have nothing to offer up, aside from my experiences, but their overwhelming backlash should prove everything.</p>

<p>One caveat before I begin. In a few short moments, you&#39;ll also notice the comments to this post being flooded with people that you may or may not have  tagged as &quot;CircleJerkers&quot;, or &quot;CircleBrokers&quot; or &quot;Olive Garden Shills&quot;. SRS is a pillar within the meta-community, and most meta-redditors are neutral to SRS, if not in support of them. Meta-redditors enjoy stability, and any effort to rock the boat will be met with resistance. </p>

<p>To start off, there are only 13 redditors, at most, behind the 39 Archangelle accounts. Some are bots, but having a large force of mod accounts allows for the Archangelles to appear to have more support than the actually do. The passwords are shared between the 13 redditors, so any Archangelle could be any one of these people. However, <a href="/u/ArchangelleDworkin">/u/ArchangelleDworkin</a>, leader of the Fempire, is controlled by one person.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Twentyone_21">/u/Twentyone_21</a></p>

<p>Of all the meta-redditors, 21 is the most familiar with the ways and means of 
SRS. He mods several meta-subreddits, either with his main account or <a href="/u/Carl_depaul_Dawkins">/u/Carl_depaul_Dawkins</a>, his primary alt. He has both accounts modded in <a href="/r/MagicSkyFairy">/r/MagicSkyFairy</a>, <a href="/r/CircleBroke2">/r/CircleBroke2</a>, and several others. In addition, each account mods subs by themselves. Most of the inner-circle of meta-redditors know, it&#39;s not uncommon for mod lists to be made of 4 people and 6 accounts. Accusations of Karmanaut-ing aside, they&#39;re using their regular accounts to infiltrate even the most innocuous of subreddits. With an alt on any modlist, they can influence almost any sub to do whatever they please.This represents a serious breach to the structural integrity of the moderator system.</p>

<p>The other mods control several alts. Often times, they share alts and it can be confusing as to who is controlling whom. This list contains, to my  knowledge, the most accurate pairings of alts and mains. While there are  &quot;slots&quot; for 13, only 9 active redditors are currently controlling the  Archangelle accounts.</p>

<p>Mods have been know to resign at any given time, the job is quite arduous and requires loads of effort for almost no tangible reward, aside from bitter man  tears. To combat this, a wait-list has been set up. Users are tapped as qualified candidates, and are added following anyone&#39;s resignation. For example, when <a href="/u/Klaatu_Barada_Nikto">/u/Klaatu_Barada_Nikto</a> deleted his account a few months ago, he was replaced by SRD mod <a href="/u/Semebay">/u/Semebay</a>. Tapping a mod of SRD was important. The influence of SRSSucks was growing within their ranks, and we sought to stem the tide. There were talks on adding <a href="/u/MilleniumFalc0n">/u/MilleniumFalc0n</a>, but as of right now he&#39;s been wait-listed. While it has been rumored for several weeks now, we have NOT tapped StopsCopiesMe for any position. We seriously have no affiliation with him, but find great amusement in your attempts to tie him to us.</p>

<p>Many of these accounts change hands regularly, and alts can become primary accounts at any moment. For example, there was once a redditor named <a href="/u/NickWasHere09">/u/NickWasHere09</a>. However, he entered into grad school and handed his account over to <a href="/u/LOLSail">/u/LOLSail</a> for safe keeping. It&#39;s also not uncommon to have several mods take on each other&#39;s alts in an effort to lower suspicion. They know about their precarious position, and will do anything to keep a trail cold.</p>

<p>The acquisition of <a href="/u/Reese_Ridley">/u/Reese_Ridley</a> was one of great joy. Reese defected to the Fempire in December, but it wasn&#39;t until February that we began to trust him. He was asked to stay on as a mod of <a href="/r/SRSSucks">/r/SRSSucks</a>, at least for the foreseeable future, which he agreed to. There were hopes that he could become a thorn in the side of <a href="/u/MittRomneysCampaign">/u/MittRomneysCampaign</a>, a user that we alternated between hating and fearing. If MRC could be controlled, or at least have his influence stymied, the Fempire could continue with little realistic resistance.</p>

<p>AA_AgonistAgent is an interesting variable within SRS, a &quot;known unknown&quot; if you will. While ACR has access to the account, it is also controlled another person. It&#39;s a mutual agreement, the account was acquired fairly. AgonistAgent is used when SRS requires an &quot;ambassador to the Marepire&quot;, either in MLPPrime or one of the many offshoots. Her boyfriend, <a href="/u/Esplin">/u/Esplin</a>, has been contacted for a similar position, but I&#39;m unaware of any progress being made. Any trolling on her part done outside the constraints of the Fempire is beyond our control, not that we would do anything to stop it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s even better about SRS is that the majority of them are straight white males. Straight white males who shit on <a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a> for no reason other than it&#39;s funny. Straight white males who support the perpetuation of false rape accusations. In the name of fun, they&#39;ll ruin everything. It&#39;s the best troll I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a newb (2 months now) I find the whole SRS thing bizzare.  Seriously; accounts inside accounts inside accounts, spending hours a day trolling?  I&#39;m old, and normally I would predict that SRS will just fade away.  My experience is that people with that kind of spare time get distracted when they get a job - or steady sex.  But in the case of SRS, I&#39;m thinking they probably have jobs (and no life), and their personalities probably preclude them from being distracted by sex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re working for an NGO, which is funded by tax dollars. The party line is to outlaw free speech and constrain everyone to certain victimhood depending on their &quot;place in society&quot; so they can become bickering groups begging the government for slices of a dwindling pie. That&#39;s SOCIALIST justice. If this weren&#39;t happening people would gravitate toward small independent groups on their own and wouldn&#39;t be centrally controlled. Instead favors/bribes are offered to &#39;groups&#39; and punishments are doled out for individuals not fitting into those groups. They just have to become victims and thus give up self-responsibility/freedom.</p>

<p>All these seemingly small control-freak groups are appendages of a giant spiritual octopus under the cover of Zionist-Masonic-Communist oppression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kind of new to Reddit, so excuse me if I&#39;m confused.  I get some of it, but terms like &quot;Meta-&quot; and &quot;CircleBrokers&quot; are meaningless to me.  Could you folks provide a glossary or something?</p>

<p>Early on, I got involved in a thread on the front page, from the r/SRSDiscussion sub.  Naive me, I knew just enough to read the first paragraph in the sub&#39;s  sidebar, the noble-sounding &quot;progressive-oriented forum for discussing issues of social justice&quot;.   The topic was an article about the girl in Florida facing a statutory rape charge.  I posted my opinion that, more or less, the whiny bitch deserved a lot stiffer sentence and was getting off easier than any man with similar charges in history had.  Yeah.</p>

<p>The feminazis swarmed me, and the White Knights rode up behind in formation.  I was impressed by such energy from such a tiny sub; they dogged me for days.  Only later did I research SRS and find out that I am &quot;discordant with the ethos of social progressivism&quot;, which I assume means I am male.</p>

<p>All in all, I think SRS is bizarre at best, and a boil on Reddit&#39;s ass which should be lanced.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/sRhfXTs.jpg">Oh yeah, about that glossary.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meta is just another name for people who like to take things to the next level, or in other words make fun or emulate something that is already making fun of something. Basically, You have <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> and then you have <a href="/r/metacirclejerk">/r/metacirclejerk</a> which makes fun of circlejerk.</p>

<p>A circlejerk is another name for a group of people who endlessly agree with themselves and shun anyone who has a different opinion, ie they are jerking themselves off to eachother. A sorta good example is <a href="/r/athiesm">/r/athiesm</a>, which many people believe to be the biggest circlejerk on Reddit, though Reddit as a whole is pretty much a circlejerk, seeing as we are all 20 somethings, white and have a college education as well as being very liberal.  </p>

<p>Circlebroke is when a circlejerk is interupted or broken. So for example Kony2012 was a massive circlejerk of people feeling good about themselves then came evidence that the guy who ran the help organisation was a bit of an idiot/lunatic. This broke the circlejerk and the circlejerking quickly changed towards dirision of anyone who supported it as well as lots of people shouting &#39;I knew it was fake!&#39;.</p>

<p>There, I hope that helps... I&#39;ve never written the word circlejerk so many times.</p>

<p>Someday I hope to penetrate the many meanings of the fedora.  I get some of it; I&#39;m a pissed off old white male and &#39;back in the day&#39; anyone wearing a peace sign was instantly shunned - it was nearly impossible to come back from that.  We gave allowances for people from Kansas and such as they truly didn&#39;t know better; usually a few weeks of partying would result in a full recovery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is literally insane witch hunting McCarthyism, so lets pick this shitpost apart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tale of <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a>[1] is one of great mystery, confusion, and self-loathing. For almost two years the SRS that we know now has been propagating itself as a sort-of Gestapo against freedom of speech. SJWs with a bone to pick, SRS users &quot;call out&quot; anything they feel is offensive to their radical-left view of society. I&#39;ve spent 14 months within their ranks, understanding their motives and their goals. I made my way into their inner circle, desperate to know and understand the women that I thought were some of the finest trolls on reddit. Once I found out the truth, I was stunned, and it took me a while to figure out what I needed to do. Today, I come to you with the real accounts of the Archangelles, their true reddit identities. These efforts didn&#39;t come easily, and I suspect they&#39;ll be quick to deny my accounts, but I promise that these are true. I have nothing to offer up, aside from my experiences, but their overwhelming backlash should prove everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You criticize them for taking reddit too seriously but I&#39;ve read books by former Navy SEALs with less embellished language, like seriously, did you just finish Creative Writing 101?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SRS is a pillar within the meta-community, and most meta-redditors are neutral to SRS, if not in support of them. Meta-redditors enjoy stability, and any effort to rock the boat will be met with resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  A huge portion of the meta community hates SRS, have you ever been to <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>?  Its an anti-SRS shitfest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of all the meta-redditors, 21 is the most familiar with the ways and means of SRS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  Is SRS now an alien race or something?  You take this so seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other mods control several alts. Often times, they share alts and it can be confusing as to who is controlling whom. This list contains, to my knowledge, the most accurate pairings of alts and mains. While there are &quot;slots&quot; for 13, only 9 active redditors are currently controlling the Archangelle accounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are wrong on 75%+ of that list, I know a lot of those people personally from private subs and IRC channels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mods have been know to resign at any given time, the job is quite arduous and requires loads of effort for almost no tangible reward, aside from bitter man tears. To combat this, a wait-list has been set up. Users are tapped as qualified candidates, and are added following anyone&#39;s resignation. For example, when <a href="/u/Klaatu_Barada_Nikto">/u/Klaatu_Barada_Nikto</a> [39] deleted his account a few months ago, he was replaced by SRD mod <a href="/u/Semebay">/u/Semebay</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, meta-subs are totally based around the Freemasons and Illuminati, thanks for reminding me to get my meta-robe laundered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tapping a mod of SRD was important. The influence of SRSSucks was growing within their ranks, and we sought to stem the tide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what you&#39;re saying here, but SRD doesn&#39;t love SRS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were hopes that he could become a thorn in the side of <a href="/u/MittRomneysCampaign">/u/MittRomneysCampaign</a> [46] , a user that we alternated between hating and fearing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one feared MRC, fear implies some kind of risk and theres no risk or anything worthwhile to lose from fucking reddit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when SRS requires an &quot;ambassador to the Marepire&quot;</p>

<p>What the fuck did I just read?  Is this an adaptation of a summary of Game of Thrones?</p>
