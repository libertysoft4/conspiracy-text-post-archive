        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was kidding around on another thread, and my reply to a reply on my comment included [So as long as you don&#39;t type &quot;The jihad is on for tomorrow&quot; or some shit, even the NSA has manpower restrictions.]  The user replied [&quot;Holy shit you just typed it&quot;].  Thinking he was kidding, I replied [Oops. At least I didn&#39;t type &quot;(user_name) is our terrorist cell leader&quot;.]  His reply was [That&#39;s some serious &quot;Fire!&quot; in a theater shit, man. Don&#39;t even make jokes!]  I suppose I may have violated Reddiquette there (I&#39;m 2 months new here, don&#39;t hate me), but it got me wondering: was the user&#39;s reaction typical?</p>

<h2>I&#39;ll include the next reply I crafted that started me thinking about this:</h2>

<p>Don&#39;t give in to the kind of paranoia that created Homeland Security and got us into this bloody mess.  Statistically, you are four times more likely to be killed by a lightning strike than by a terrorist.  If the entire country was that rational all along, we wouldn&#39;t be in this mess.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t have the exact statistics on the odds of being flagged and arrested for terrorism due to talking trash, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s in the same range.  Millions of people are using the same words to discuss this issue; the odds are way, way, <em>way</em> on my side.</p>

<p>Seriously: if we are already censoring ourselves out of fear of the &quot;security&quot; agencies?  Then the douche-nozzle, scumbag assholes who are spying on us have already won.  And I&#39;m wondering if that hasn&#39;t already happened.  Have we altered the way we engage in national discussions on the most important issues of our time?  Are people in the US now afraid to speak out against the absurdity of the imaginary &quot;War On Terrorism&quot;?</p>

<h2>How much has our country spent battling &quot;terrorism&quot; in the last two decades?  It has to be well over $1 trillion!  Maybe $2 trillion or higher.  All to &quot;protect&quot; us from a &quot;threat&quot; <strong>less fucking common than fucking lightning?</strong></h2>

<p>That the &quot;War On Terror&quot; is totally irrational is a simple fact: the numbers and statistics to support that conclusion are public knowledge and are not in dispute by anyone.  So it follows that any actual fear a US citizen has about a terrorist attack hurting themselves or a loved is also irrational.  </p>

<p><strong>Finally, cutting to the chase:</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know what other Redditors think.  Are users here <em>already</em> avoiding the use of &quot;red flag&quot; keywords out of fear of being monitored by the NSA?  Have US Citizens already begun to censor themselves out of fear of our own government?</p>

<p>tl;dr - Commented about the NSA, was told I should censor myself, wondered if many Americans are censoring their speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As one who marched against Vietnam, even after Kent State which raised the stakes quite a bit (imagine if they started shooting Occupy protesters today), this bums me out.  Our country used to be a place where I could - in spite of everything - still trust our government; and until I was almost 40 I always felt that most police officers would help me out if I truly needed it.  Silly me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  We are using our freedom of speech.  They are losing.  We are winning.  A few more whistle blowers will be a big help.  The elite can&#39;t handle the exposure, it causes more people to become aware of what is going on.  Once they wake up they don&#39;t go back to sleep.  How many new &#39;awake&#39; people are there just because of the NSA leak and how many from that car bomb?  Or did those things put people to sleep.  It takes years to pacify a nation, it only takes one event to wake up millions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, after some terrorist bombing or another I downloaded a bunch of books on how to make bombs.  I was curious how easy it was, because the people building them didn&#39;t seem like highly educated chemists.  My hard drive crashed and took my ebook library with it.  Assuming I could even find those books again, I wouldn&#39;t download them.  If I ever did get investigated for it, I figured I would tell them I was doing research for a book though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand a user&#39;s feels and all; being polite is just courtesy.  I mistakenly assumed &quot;Holy shit you just typed it&quot; was a joke on his part and thought I was replying in kind.  Wouldn&#39;t have upped the ante otherwise.  But still, I have to wonder.  It concerns me that Americans are giving in to fear too much these days.</p>

<p>If I still held my DOD Secret-Level security clearance, I wouldn&#39;t kid around so loosely; the FBI literally went to my neighborhood and interviewed my neighbors in person before granting my clearance.  They really do have no sense of humor about serious threats to national security, and I definitely do not blame them at all.  This may well be part of what shapes my current attitude: I used to work in an industry where just screwing up on the job could mean the near-certain deaths of hundreds of innocents, so watching people panic about something as rare as lightning is frustrating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know what you&#39;re saying. there are just some things that i avoid joking about no matter who is listening; it&#39;s always been like that for me, not because i&#39;m afraid of the consequences of what i&#39;m saying but because (to me) some things shouldn&#39;t be joked about. having an intelligent, informed discussion about what is going on in the political world is never off limits, though. but i think that is what many people are afraid to do nowadays.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s history? Certainly not ours if they&#39;re going to keep it secret from us.  I studied History in school.  One of the subjects I took was Historiography or the study of how history is written.  Very interesting subject.  Either way, while the Internet may be recorded for all time, some things are deliberately kept out of the books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you give in to fear and paranoia you start playing the game they want you to play. Many people will give in to fear. They will be told to be afraid and then they will comply and be afraid. They&#39;re unwittingly playing the game that the self-appointed rulers want them to play. Try not to hold it against them.</p>

<p>Will people censor their speech? Of course. Many people still think that the government is legitimate and should be taken seriously. In which case they will do whatever the government tells them to do. They&#39;re not thinking two steps ahead - they&#39;re thinking one step ahead. The great tragedy of humanity is that they&#39;re terrible chess players. I myself am only able to think four or five moves ahead (at my best I was able to think seven moves ahead - oh, youth, where hast thou fled?). Your logic and level of thinking is not where most people live. They live in a one-move-ahead world in which they literally only think one move ahead.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you, though.</p>

<p>Terror, War on <em>some</em> drugs, terrorist, Cheney, terrorism, drone strikes, terrorist, Obama, terrorist cell, NSA, terrorist plot, 9-11, jihad, Syria, terrorist, Clinton, terrorist, W. Bush, terrorist, Monsanto, terrorist, Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Hello, NSA. You may go fuck yourselves as you see fit.</p>

<p>Will they modify my behavior?</p>

<p>Not really. Freedom of speech means I get to say whatever I want. </p>

<p>If anything they&#39;re making it more fun to exercise my rights.</p>
