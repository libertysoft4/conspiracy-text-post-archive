    <div class="md"><p>It seems like circular logic, because the underlying problem hasn&#39;t been addressed.</p>

<p>Look at it this way: If you were in a relationship and your girlfriend repeatedly lied to you - constantly - there would be a period of time, after she said, &quot;I promise I&#39;m telling the truth from now on&quot; where you would question her every motive, every word, because you&#39;d lost complete trust in her.</p>

<p>No one trusts the media anymore, because they haven&#39;t earned back that trust via repeated proving that they deserve it. They may never be able to earn it back - not the mainstream media, anyway.</p>

<p>When you add to it that all the mainstream media are owned by a couple of huge corporations that are historically known to be in bed with the government, that makes everything they do seem suspect immediately.</p>

<p>The issue isn&#39;t &quot;so when the media is with you on this particular topic.&quot; It&#39;s more of a question of &quot;Why is the media with me on this particular topic, when they&#39;ve been lying scumbag partisan fear-mongerers for years? This is out of the ordinary, and it smells fishy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The free press response to the NSA/Snowden whistle blowing, specifically on television, is worthy of bringing tears to the eyes of every red blooded American. The level of government controlled propaganda coming from everyone from the (expected) Piers Morgan to the (completely unbelievable and reprehensible) Bill Maher is so reminiscent of the depiction of the press in 1984 and V for Vendetta that they should be ashamed of themselves, and the people need to stand up and cry out against being spoon-fed a badly spun take on what is one of the most anti-American intentional exploitation of the 9/11 coup in existence today. Snowden has done nothing but confirm what every single American in information technology has known since the disclosure of the details of the Carnivore program 8 years ago...</p>

<p>These programs have focused on re-assuring Americans everywhere that it is necessary in this day in age to trade freedom and liberty for security; this is an antithetical falsehood, and one that has been warned against over, and over again for hundreds of years—since the advent of a real people&#39;s government. This is exactly what we have lost already today, hidden obviously behind the lie that we have all been warned about by Orwell in 1948. What you are witnessing today is the intentional and controlled release of information, the progression to the world Orwell depicted almost 70 years ago. The question is who is controlling the release, and what their intentions are. It smells like the stuff of... civil unrest, to me. In order to deliver on that prophesy, the next few years will be riddled with more and more illicit “disclosures”of more and more intrusive programs, and a population that cares just enough to do absolutely nothing about it.</p>

<p>All over, there is a pronounced focus on the breach of security clearance, though in the case of Federal actions which are illegal, these leaks are clearly protected by Federal law. The issue at hand here, is that the Federal government has chosen to ignore its contract with the people, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, under the guise of protecting them from an enemy which is all but a figment of their imagination, designed specifically to battle their true enemy—the freedom of the people. Rather than looking at Edward Snowden, the true American Government needs to look to the officials who have designed and approved of this systematic violation of the supreme law of the land, as well as those that have assisted in hiding these programs for so many years and prosecute them... for treason against The United States of America. We already know that knowledge and approval of this program reaches the highest level, during both the Bush and Obama White House--this is the epitome of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot; The question at hand is not whether or not we need to be changing our outlook on privacy because of technology, or because of terrorism; but rather on a government that has circumvented its own law, and has no regard or respect for the people or their ability to govern themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bring-back-the-death-penalty-fox-analyst-rips-snowden-for-seeking-to-be-kim-kardashian-of-natl-security/">http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bring-back-the-death-penalty-fox-analyst-rips-snowden-for-seeking-to-be-kim-kardashian-of-natl-security/</a> - Piers is absolutely right about the death penalty, except he&#39;s the one committing treason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no. Actually, all the MSM outlets in my metro are &quot;on the fence&quot; but &quot;siding with the NSA&quot; in the end, as the &quot;terrorists win&quot;, of course, if we don&#39;t cavity search you all. It&#39;s seriously sickening to listen to these mealy mouths worm their way through the talking points like the presstitutes they are.</p>

<p>Some anecdotal points (paraphrased):</p>

<p>Dennis Prager (neo-con religious right wing radio host): To paraphrase, he says we need the NSA intrusion, because the Taliban throws acid in little girls&#39; faces. This was his tactic.</p>

<p>WCCO (cbs) noon radio show (Chad Hartman and gang): All show hosts &quot;agree&quot;, mealy-mouth style, that the NSA snooping is basically ok and needed, because of all the &quot;possible terrorist reports&quot; that must make their way onto the presidents desk, &quot;understandibly forcing him&quot; to take action by any/all means available, including snooping on Americans.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be a two-week blip in the cycle, then back to Kimye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a standard judgement of him, yet, on the media. There is outrage from some about the dangers he will provoke and treasonous acts he committed, there is some praise from the usual channels that have reported on similar situations in the past.</p>

<p>The ONLY standard response to this so far has been the critique and falling trust on the Obama administration. And that&#39;s what I find interesting. This was the <em>coup de grace</em> after the constant attacks from the GOP. Not saying some of those attacks aren&#39;t valid or the NSA mess isn&#39;t serious, but I fear all this is just a smear campaign to solidify the <em>coronation</em> of the next in the Bush dynasty line, and all the outrage over privacy will be forgotten as soon as the balloons and confetti are in the ground.</p>
