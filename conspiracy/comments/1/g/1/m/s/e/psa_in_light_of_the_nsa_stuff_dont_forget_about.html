We need to attack were it hurts, The money machine!! national day of strike, halt national productivity, or march up to elected officials. We need threaten them with impeachment .

<p>Now imagine a boycott?

<p>For every hundred thousand people who actively boycott a company, ten million will continue using it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what they want. Then they can come in with Marshall law and do whatever the hell they want. While you&#39;re focusing on &quot;taking to the streets&quot; (and accomplishing absolutely nothing other than giving the media something to talk about), they will be just implementing whatever the hell they want because there will be no due process to stop them. It&#39;s kind of like what ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) did in the 80&#39;s (I think it was late 80&#39;s?) with the unions, except on a smaller scale. While the unions were on strike, they filled the spots with scab workers, and then updated all of their equipment. When the strike ended, they didn&#39;t have to hire a huge chunk of them back because the equipment replaced a lot of their manual labor. Had they not coerced a strike, they would have never been able to implement the new equipment, because the union workers would be on the job and know exactly what was going on and would have been able to stop it. It may be smaller scale, but it is EXACTLY the same concept. </p>

<p>Protesting does nothing. It just makes you look like a clown. I think someone else said it... We need to hit them at the bank. Letting the banks merge in the 90&#39;s was the most moronic thing we&#39;ve ever done. I&#39;m not going to preach republican or democrat, liberal or conservative, or anything in between. Regardless of where one falls on the spectrum, it should be obvious both sides of the table in DC are corrupt assholes with too much power. Give the states more control. Hell, give the counties more control. Stop feeding the machine. We need to get our priorities straight. </p>

<p>EDIT: typo. That damn auto correct...</p>

<p>Go ahead and stand in the street bitching with your big colorful sign you spent 2 hours on. The rest of us will actually do something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, my comments on the banks was in reference to the others on the thread. I was by no means saying that is the sole solution. In fact, I mentioned the scope of government control as well. We have allowed them to become too big and too centralized. A lot of that has to do with the control of money, yes, but a lot of it also has to do with how we have voted and who we have voted for as well. There are other factors as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Manning trial won&#39;t be concluded for months. And as for turkey do you honestly think the majority of Americans even understand what is going on in Turkey or even care to.. At least mainstream American news agencies are covering this leak. This is a very important leak to inspire new whistleblowers in the future generations. Although it did happen at this time it is still definitely good news. I highly doubt it is a conspiracy to hide anything from the already oblivious population..</p>
