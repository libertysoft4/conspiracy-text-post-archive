        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like so much information is coming to light, daily. So much people can&#39;t really keep up with it all or enough to get a grasp on it.</p>

<p>It seems as if we are all being primed for some kind of existential threat, be it alien, dollar collapse, environmental or war. Pick one. </p>

<p>The controllers are losing control and trust from common people all around the world. Once governments(s) lose trust, it is typically down hill from there. It seems as though they are planting seeds of discontent, so when and if the threat arises, they will be able to control those that dissent and rise up.</p>

<p>I say this in the context of other &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; like the DHS bullet buying, the FEMA camps, domestic drones, and NSA spying. For if the spying &quot;worked&quot; they way they intend it to, shouldn&#39;t they have been able to stop the Boston Bombers?</p>

<p>I believe the NSA collection is to get real time pulse with algorithms to feel what he people are thinking. </p>

<p>I think they know people are fed up, so they must first get the common people mad. Many of us knew this NSA stuff was going on, now they have the attention of the less awakened and now they can create a problem to get the masses on board with their solution. </p>

<p>I think the dollar collapse is most likely. Then they can formulate an array of  solutions to &quot;combat&quot; &quot;climate change.&quot;</p>

<p>We have growing population, environmental issues and food supply and many people so discontent that nothing really gets done in governments. They need a new crisis and I believe we are being primed for a comming event in our near future.</p>

<p>Advice to those already present and awake: Step back, take notes, organize, stratagize, find people that can create communities of doers and movers and plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The revolution that will set humanity free will be a conscious one. When each individual begins to wake up and start asking questions. Start to connect the dots and realize there&#39;s a greater purpose to our life on earth. Something outside of politics, religion, institutions, sports and etc. There is a binding fabric to all humanity and the fact is we&#39;re all from the same tribe. When people come to this realization all suffering will end. Would you kill another that you considered your brother/sister? Or pollute and rape the earth which you regards as your mother? The key is to bring the focus inward since that is where the truth resides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend removing the alien comment. It immediately makes a large portion of the population dismiss everything else you have to say. It&#39;s fiction. If aliens have visited earth and wanted to contact humanity, a few corrupt politicians wouldn&#39;t be able to hide them from the rest of us. And if they wanted to manipulate humans without us knowing, there&#39;d be fuck-all we could do about it. No one would <em>ever</em> find out unless they wanted us to. And no one could stop us from finding out if they wanted that instead. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen hundreds of UFO videos - they&#39;re all bullshit. I&#39;ve looked at hundreds of crop circles - all idiots looking for attention. Read or watched all the ancient alien conspiracy theories - all desperately reaching. Just let it go. Focus on the real issues we have here on earth, because the moment you mention aliens, you lose every scientist and critical thinker that might otherwise have paid attention to what is actually an important point that you&#39;re making. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man...</p>

<p>Okay, first of all, science does not deal in &quot;facts,&quot; it deals in hypotheses, theories, and laws, each of which have an increasing degree of qualification, but none of which qualifies as a certain proof. Anyone who uses the term &quot;scientific fact&quot; is either trying to sell you something, or does not understand the principles of science. Science is a form of empiricism, which was founded by Sextus Empiricus on the same fundaments as those of his teacher Pyrrho of Elis, who founded Pyrrhonic Skepticism, the primary halmark of which is the suspension of all conclusivity without absolute proof (not like Academic Skepticism which paradoxically denies the possibility of absolute proof). So any real scientist is marked by his or her willingness to remain uncertain unless there is absolutely no logical alternative to a conclusion. That&#39;s why real scientists don&#39;t use the word &quot;fact.&quot;</p>

<p>And while you are correct that the probability of extraterrestrial life is very high, the probability of us having encountered it is very, very low. Space is very big, and everything in it is getting further apart all the time. </p>

<p>That being said, I am not the kind of person who flippantly dismisses the ideas of others, which is why I&#39;ve taken a lot of time to look up UFO videos, crop circle analyses, and ancient alien theories myself. I&#39;ve seen nothing convincing, but  perhaps we simply subject what we&#39;ve seen to a different level of scrutiny. I would be very interrested to see some of the incontrovertible proof of which you speak. If you can show me even one piece of evidence which I cannot logically refute, I would be exstatic. Few things would make me happier than feeling certain that we were in the presence of beings from another world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong, it is scientific <em>theory.</em> There&#39;s a big difference. </p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s always a semantical argument about the specific definition of words, so if you use the word &quot;fact&quot; to mean the same thing as the word &quot;theory&quot; (as it is used in science), then you would of course be correct. However, the common usage of &quot;fact&quot; is not the same as the scientific usage of &quot;theory.&quot; Facts are generally considered to be like &quot;absolutes,&quot; and that is not at all what a theory is. </p>

<p>A theory is simply a hypothesis which has not been disproved, despite many efforts to do so. That doesn&#39;t mean it has to be correct. Theories are regularly falsified, at which point they are no longer called theories. As an example, this year we adjusted the estimated age of the universe to 100 million years older than we had previously thought because of improved data from more sensitive telescopes. The old theory was replaced by the new, but even though we now use that new number in our equations involving universal simulators, we do not feel certain about the new number because it could be revised some day just like the old number was. </p>

<p>Facts don&#39;t work the same way. When people speak of facts, they are generally refering to a certainty; something that will not become false in the future. Science doesn&#39;t have anything like that. All of science is held in a state of perpetual uncertainty. The scientific method is founded on a philosophy whose hallmark is the suspension of conclusivity. Anyone who tells you differently does not understand science. I have made a decade+ long study of the epistemics of science, as compared to the epistemics of other ideologies, and I have found that very few people actually understand how the scientific method works, particularly as it relates to conclusions. People think science produces knowledge; truths; facts. It does not. It produces probabilities; estimates; likelihoods. Never certainties. </p>

<p>The only way for science to produce facts is if every observable in the universe has been accounted for, none of the theories accounting for them contradict each other, and no superfluous explanations remain after everything has been explained. Then it could be said that science has produced knowledge or facts. Until then, it is a puzzle with no borders, and no finished picture to reference, to know if we are assembling it correctly. We can only guess at the correct placement of an idea based on how well it fits to the ideas around it. That&#39;s what theories are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and people always adding aliends to the list of conspiracies doesn&#39;t help. I have no problem whatsoever with people being hopeful about aliens or personally believing that they have visited earth. But the body of evidence for aliens is simply not the same calibre as the body of evidence for things like harmful GMO affects, climate change, banker fraud, government surveillance, and private prison industry profiteering. And when it&#39;s included under the same umbrella, it automatically drags the level of credibility of every other assertion down to the level of credibility of alien hypotheses, which is harmful to the attempts to have them taken seriously. </p>

<p>If any of you guys believe in aliens visiting earth, more power to you; I hope you&#39;re right, and I hope they show themselves soon. But if you really want something done about these other issues, you need to make the alien discussions separate from them. I understand you may take aliens just as seriously as the other issues, but most people do not. There&#39;s no harm in recognizing your audience and tailoring your message for maximum effect. A separate post about aliens is not going to hurt your inquiries about it, and it <em>will</em> help your inquiries about the other issues. No disrespect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and statistically, it is illogical to assume that we have been visited by aliens. I know that the probability of their existence is very high, but the probability of them existing in a vicinity near us, with an advanced enough civilization for interstellar travel, is very low. Dismissably low. </p>

<p>Besides, if aliens visited and wanted to harm us, no one could stop them. Period. And if they wanted to contact us or help us, likewise, no one could stop them. The technology requisite for interstellar travel is vastly beyond human capabilities. It would be like magic compared to ours, and they would be like gods. Completely unstoppable. Governments may seem like daunting powers to you and I, but to an interstellar species, they would be no more capable than ants on anthills in Africa, as the saying goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t. But if they <em>are</em> living amongst us, then it must be that they don&#39;t want the general public to know it yet, unless you think some comparatively primitive human politician could manage to hide a vastly more advanced interstellar being who does not wish to be kept hidden? If they don&#39;t want people to know, then we simply won&#39;t be able to know until or unless they change their minds. And if they <em>are</em> here, and they <em>do</em> want to hide, then what&#39;s the point in continuing to speculate about them? Especially when that speculation decreases the perceived validity of any other topic delivered alongside it. We wouldn&#39;t be able to get any information they didn&#39;t want us to have anyway, so why spend time guessing when there are other pressing issues that we humans need to deal with? </p>

<p>But, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, although the statistical likelihood of extraterrestrial life is extremely high, the chances of extraterrestrial life which is already interstellar, and is within a detailed observational vicinity of earth is extremely low. The signals we&#39;ve been sending out into space since we became a radio-capable civilization have not reached more than a few galaxies at this point. It hasn&#39;t even been 100 years, and there aren&#39;t many galaxies within 100 lightyears of us. Furthermore, we&#39;ve pretty thoroughly observed the bulk of those galalxies, and seen nothing in them that indicates life. So, chances are there <em>is</em> other life out there, and chances are it has no idea we exist, and isn&#39;t anywhere near us.</p>
