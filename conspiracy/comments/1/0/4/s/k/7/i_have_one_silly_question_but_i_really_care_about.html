I found, that not everything is as I believed and not everything in media is true. Gaining knowledge made me look at things differently. In connections. But by gaining more knowledge it made me look back again at facts and root of what many people are hating here. Surprisingly, I see it in new perspective again - same as when I read first conspiracy theory. I think many conspiracy theories are right but more interesting is what is behind them. Good or Evil?</p>

<p>Some kind of control over the human masses has to be. It is something what is in our nature. Every group, small or big, had always some leader. Someone who was building and sustaining unity between the individuals in group. In the smallest groups it was shaman. In bigger we have to have him too. I dont think we have to fight against centralisation but to try give it to right hands. why is NWO bad idea? What is bad about it and what would be better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey teaseo.</p>

<p>I have an MA in sociology and as a extracurricular project watched ALL of Star Trek twice.</p>

<p>I completely agree with your assessment and I enjoy discussing Star Trek as a philosophical base, a modern Republic, in a way.</p>

<p>For instance: I am convinced that the Federation is a post-scarcity society, but Fascist to the core. I mean actually fascist, not the epithete.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...the Nazis saw themselves as firmly part of the extremist right in German politics and despised liberals and actual socialists (and of course, communists), who were properly placed on the left of the political spectrum. </p>

<p>In other words, National Socialism had nothing to do with socialism then or now. Those elements of the party which clung to some hope that actual socialism would be a part of the Nazi platform, were kicked out.</p>

<p>Strasser wanted to know what Hitler would do with Krupp and the other big German corporations when he became dictator. “Would everything remain unchanged in terms of ownership, profits and management?”</p>

<p>“But of course,” Hitler replied.”Do you think I’m mad enough to destroy the economy?” Hitler would intervene, he told Strasser, only when companies failed to act in the “national interest.”</p>

<p>As Friedrich writes, Strasser was dismayed. He told Hitler that if he was planning on retaining the capitalist system he had no right to speak of Socialism. Hitler told Strasser that the term “socialism” was “intrinsically bad” and repeated his position. </p>

<p>Strasser was extremely naive if he had failed to pick up on the support given the Nazi Party by big industrialists from very early on.</p>

<p>In fact, on 26 January 1932, Hitler would even address the Industry Club, Friedrich writes, “and tried to assure them that they had nothing to fear from his party’s economic policies.” In his two-and-a-half-hour speech he gave a very Social Darwinist, Republican justification for capitalism and private wealth, that those who have wealth have it because they deserve it and because they deserve it they’re better than everybody else... </p>

<p>It is clear that Hitler saw socialists in the same light as Republicans – they were nothing more than Marxists and Bolsheviks. He drew no real distinction between socialists and communists and neither do Republicans as we see almost daily from their rhetoric. <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/hitler-explains-gop-wrong-national-socialism.html">http://www.politicususa.com/hitler-explains-gop-wrong-national-socialism.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem we are having is due to fascism being neither &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; in our terms. More of an extremist centrism. I mispoke when I said fascism was socialist, it is however not capitalist, at all, and it is socialized in regard to state support of individuals. </p>

<p>Your wall of text is inconsequential - nationalist socialism was similar to fascism, but they are different systems.</p>

<p>That fascism is socialistic? That nazism and capitalism are different? These are both far too basic of ideas for me to quote you. How about go read: Mein Kampf and The Wealth of Nations? (Both by authors I already cited).</p>

<p>Or do you want me to prove that the Federation is fascist? Did you realize we are talking about Star Trek? You are taking this all very strangely.</p>

<p>1) The vast number of things that can and will go wrong in a plan of that scale. </p>

<p>2) The nature of the people running the new royalty will always be backstabbing each other for more power.</p>

<p>3) Technology. If you can&#39;t understand the systems that are subverting your power you won&#39;t be able to effectively combat them. </p>

<p>I think you are thinking of a Star Trek United Earth style abundance economy which sounds awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really isn&#39;t bad at all. In the past century we&#39;ve seen exponential growth in almost every QoL indicator, from life expectancy to median caloric intake to infant mortality. Wars kill fewer people as a percentage if overall population than they did in the past. Diseases like dysentery that once killed kings have been rendered a mere nuisance.</p>

<p>Material wise, our poors are far better off than 2nd/3rd world nation poors and most rich people from history. Most &quot;poor&quot; in this country go to sleep on a full stomach. Poors have running water, access to modern health care, cheap entertainment, alcohol, food stamps, automobiles, cell phones, the internet, libraries, and on and on. If your biggest concern these days is that google might be &quot;tracking&quot; you every time you go to Food Lion, or there might be microwave towers causing a 2% rise in the incidence of some rare tumor, just remember that typhoid wiped out the whole colony at Jamestown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey teaseo.</p>

<p>I have an MA in sociology and as a extracurricular project watched ALL of Star Trek twice.</p>

<p>I completely agree with your assessment and I enjoy discussing Star Trek as a philosophical base, a modern Republic, in a way.</p>

<p>For instance: I am convinced that the Federation is a post-scarcity society, but Fascist to the core. I mean actually fascist, not the epithete.</p>
