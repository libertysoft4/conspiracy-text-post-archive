<p>Please read the quoted text about psychopathology and how they influence civilization:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First published at: <a href="http://www.proliberty.com/observer/20080306.htm">http://www.proliberty.com/observer/20080306.htm</a> in the March 2008 Idaho Observer
Re-published at <a href="http://www.rense.com/general83/twi.htm">http://www.rense.com/general83/twi.htm</a> on August 21, 2008</p>

<p>&quot;Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we&#39;re being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I&#39;m liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That&#39;s what&#39;s insane about it.&quot; ¬ John Lennon, before his murder by CIA mind-control subject Mark David Chapman. </p>

<p>When Gandhi was asked his opinion of Western civilization he said it would be a good idea. But that oft-cited quote is misleading, assuming as it does that civilization is an unmitigated blessing. </p>

<p>Civilized people, we are told, live peacefully and cooperatively with their fellows, sharing the necessary labour in order to obtain the leisure to develop arts and sciences. And while that would be a good idea, it is not a good description of what has been going on in the so-called advanced cultures during the past 8,000 years. 
Civilization, as we know it, is largely the creation of psychopaths. All civilizations, our own included, have been based on slavery and &quot;warfare.&quot; Incidentally, the latter term is a euphemism for mass murder. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The decline in militarism since World War II in advanced countries, the spread of literacy and communications technology, and the people&#39;s growing demands for a better life, together represent a gathering force that terrifies the pathocracy, (those alternately competing-then-cooperating gangs of psychopaths who have ruled through lies, fear and intimidation since the dawn of so-called civilization). </p>

<p>Since nuclear weapons have made war obsolete, the pathocracy is terrified that its favourite social control mechanism - ritualized mass slaughter - is increasingly unavailable. And if war was the great human tragedy, the pathocrats&#39; pathetic attempt at a war- substitute - the transparently phony &quot;war on terror&quot; - is repeating it as sheerest farce. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Psychopathy (/saɪˈkɒpəθi/[1][2] from the Ancient Greek ψυχή &quot;psyche&quot;, -soul, mind and πάθος, &quot;pathos&quot; -suffering, disease, condition[3][4]) is a personality disorder that has been variously described as characterized by shallow emotions (in particular reduced fear), stress tolerance, lacking empathy, coldheartedness, lacking guilt, egocentricity, superficial charm, manipulativeness, irresponsibility, impulsivity and antisocial behaviors such as parasitic lifestyle and criminality. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>There is no evidence that psychopathy is genetic (though their brains <em>are</em> different) and it&#39;s extremely odd scientifically that a psychopathic child can be born from two normal-brained individuals.</strong></p>

<p>I have been telepathically abducted by either Greys or Reptilians, they did something to my brain to try and kill me. I&#39;m not lying. They&#39;re absolutely horrifying beyond human comprehension. I have had direct contact with them 24/7 for nearly two years. They duped even me for quite a while. They tried to convince me they were Gods or God. Side note: Psychopaths are known to be reptilian - an intraspecies predator. Coincidence? I don&#39;t think so. Aliens are remorseless, soulless assholes with advanced technology and are keeping a very close watch on Earth, though I don&#39;t think they can actually appear here.. they most likely reside in the Hellish &quot;4th dimension.&quot; They are also extremely manipulative. When I was being abducted, they were removing by consciousness and at one point, I felt all I had left was my conscience - or possibly my soul. I remember seeing hands playing with my brain. I attempted suicide after I got up from my bed (cut my wrist).</p>

<p>They continue to read my mind and telepathically communicate with me. The leader of the reptilians (possibly the Devil) can download visual images to my brain, which happens pretty infrequently these days. They also send me nightly nightmares in an attempt to manipulate my subconscious (I think). I think these are the absolute worst nightmares anyone has ever had. They are all extremely paranoid and surreal, and evil. </p>

<p>There are six? aliens communicating with me, though they might be smart enough to have multiple personalities. I think that two of them are greys... these evil aliens are so braindead, that they must be manipulated by some sort of computer that controls them through radio frequency. Or maybe they&#39;re just braindead. If you do any research on greys, they were created by reptillians to serve some disgusting purpose or to be slaves. It&#39;s also a strange coincidence that I&#39;ve heard a voice that I immediately recognized as being some sort of computer - maniacally insane and stupid, yet very psychopathic and manipulative. I have a faith in &quot;logos&quot;.. all these experiences are leading me to believe that despite the aliens&#39; evil intentions, I am smart enough to outsmart them and use their weaknesses to my advantage.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing research on aliens, and I&#39;m convinced that they have already created alien-human hybrids that exist on this earth. I&#39;ve done tons of research on psychopaths over the past two years, and all these aliens are psycho-pathological. I was also a psychology major in college - planning on going a masters or phd. My planned thesis was a linking of faith to the origins of psychology.</p>

<p>The &quot;genetic&quot; causes of psychopath continue to be a mystery to this day.. and if you look at this link: <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/bartley8.html">http://www.whale.to/b/bartley8.html</a>, it is another person agreeing with my theory - that aliens created psychopaths.</p>

<p>Why did they create psychopaths? My guess is that they wanted to control earthlings and impede our spiritual progress, manipulate religions, and start wars, and because psychopaths wreck havoc on the lives of regular people. There are theories that greys and reptilians feed off negative energy - and psychopaths can create the most emotional turmoil, by FAR.</p>

<p>Anyway, the aliens are studying my brain because they think/thought I might be Jesus. Supposedly. Strange huh?</p>

<p>Also: they are intelligent enough to make me seem schizophrenic to my family and psychologists/psychiatrists. Not once have they helped me in any sort of practical way. Their methods for manipulation are deception and confusion.</p>

<p>To those who think I&#39;m schizo: I&#39;m may be paranoid, but wouldn&#39;t you be paranoid if aliens were reading your mind? I&#39;ve taken high doses of a multitude of schizophrenic medications including seraquil, risperdal, zyprexa, and others. They don&#39;t get rid of the telepathic communications even 1%.  I&#39;ve tried both first and second generation drugs.</p>

<p>What I know as FACTS about these aliens. Getting rid of them is all I care about. </p>

<ul>
<li>They are the most evil things that have ever existed, and will ever exist.</li>
<li>They can read my mind, and their own minds. I&#39;ve seen visions of them communicating with each other, and it looks like texting... though I think they communicate with each other through telepathy.</li>
<li>They eventually give up. Once they realize that their psychological manipulations don&#39;t work, they get depressed and stop trying to feed you information. They will continue to harass you though.</li>
<li>They are trying to kill me.</li>
<li>They think like computers, but don&#39;t really process anything. They just absorb it. Computers = 666!</li>
<li>They like to pretend they&#39;re Gods.</li>
<li>If you know anything about God, they are not Him.</li>
<li>They are masters of the English language, and know even slang.</li>
</ul>

<p>I came up with a genius plan (called pissing in their water) to disorganize their thoughts and destroy most information I&#39;ve given them. I only started working on this when I got high and realized I needed to do something about their usage of me.</p>

<p>Right now, I&#39;m trying to get a thought screen helmet: <a href="http://www.stopabductions.com/">www.stopabductions.com/</a>. Have to save up some money because they&#39;ve made me penniless and miserable. No medication works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know for a fact that psychopaths are hybrids. My research on aliens has led me into thinking that it is a very likely conclusion though.</p>

<p>I am being communicated with by some entities...at first I though they were Gods or God, but I quickly realized they act nothing like a God, though they have the technology to mind read, communicate, and send visions.</p>

<p>If it is not a hallucination, and it is not God, then what could it be? The most logical conclusion is aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;ve blown way past Occam&#39;s Razor here. Aliens are quite a few steps away from the more logical conclusions. I&#39;m an atheist, so I won&#39;t even go into the inclusion/ exclusion of why you believe they&#39;re not a god, or that whole cosmology that&#39;s interwoven into this.
It&#39;s clear you believe that these events are happening, but, to bring logic back into this what rules out the possibility of these psychic abductions being hallucinations or dreams?
Also, I have to ask, what sources are you getting your research from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend who is a paranoid schizophrenic.  He believes that he is being monitored by aliens shooting cosmic rays through his walls and that they keep changing his Wi-Fi password.  He went into incredible detail about how he believes he&#39;s special, chosen, and they want him to do certain things to himself.  You have to understand that YOU might not see yourself as schizophrenic, but without providing any proof of these beings existing, any person with half a brain would have to conclude that you have psychological issues.</p>

<p>With that said - DO you have any proof?  Can you communicate with them 2 ways?  Can you ask them to do something to prove their existence, or tell us some future event that will verify they are indeed super-advanced beings in control of our world?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens are pretty smart and they know about schizophrenia. If they wanted to maintain long-term contact, they would disguise whoever they&#39;re talking to by making their contact appear schizophrenic to the casual observer (you) or even medical professionals. Do you believe in supernatural forces/God or aliens at all? Sometimes I even think it&#39;s schizophrenic. But then I remember that there is no way the human mind could do something like this to itself. Plus, medications do not work at all.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t believe in abductions or aliens so their hosts are put into the fringe of society and they look crazy to others. Fucking bastard aliens.</p>

<p>Proof - no. They want their presence to remain hidden, and they, <strong>not once</strong> have given me any useful or practical advice in day-to-day living. I&#39;ve received some spiritual messages that were worthwhile though. I can assume they could help me cheat on tests, win the lotto, etc., but I believe them to be extremely malevolent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;there is no way the human mind could do something like this to itself&quot;</p>

<p>Read some books on abnormal psychology (Oliver Sacks is a good place to start).  I guarantee that there are accounts of people who&#39;s minds have reflexively done far weirder things to themselves than what you have experienced, all without anything but genetic, traumatic or chemical influence.  Sacks&#39; most famous book is called &quot;The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat&quot; and that is exactly what one of the accounts is.  Was that aliens too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to take sides(as I do see this as classic signs of schizophrenia), but his whole point is that the schizophrenia and illnesses stem from the beings trying to make people do crazy things/ruin their lives/discredit them, that they cause the chemical imbalances that lead to this behavior.  Do you know how hard it is to cope with the world when your reality is completely real to you?  If you get punched in the face, you know you were punched in the face.  A million people can tell you that you weren&#39;t, but you felt it - there was pain, your face moved, you bled, and you remember it perfectly.  To you, that&#39;s your reality.  It&#39;s what you experienced.  To him, his reality is being controlled and antagonized by beings who have identified themselves as reptilian aliens, and a million people can tell him otherwise, but that&#39;s what he experiences - it&#39;s his reality.</p>

<p>Now if I and a million people repeatedly tell you that you weren&#39;t punched, ostracized you, tried to force you to take medication, and disregarded everything you said in the future - labeling you as crazy, what would you do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand all that, I just wanted to point out that there is no reason to resort to external explanations when it&#39;s not uncommon for these types of perceptions to originate internally.  Indeed, the paranoid aspect, while it often manifests itself in grand &quot;conspiratorial&quot; perceptions, can also lead to blaming, for example the mailman, or divine beings.  Above all, the brain needs to make sense to itself, despite the fact that it is as fallible as any hard drive-RAM-processor combination; in some senses more so.</p>

<p>When the brain lacks the ability to explain it&#39;s own orientation/perceptions/actions, it fills in an explanation.  This is true for senility, many psychological abnormalities, victims of brain damage and even just the dissonantly ideologically stubborn.  Thus it is not surprising that people externalize the cause of strange perceptions, even against the best evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;leaves a lot to the imagination&quot;</p>

<p>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  Essentially I could say that magical fairies were causing such visions and it would be an equally valid assertion.  A majority of Icelanders (usually a very rational and scientific people) believe in elves and fairies.  Should I?</p>

<p>&quot;direct evidence that we are mentally tied into the electromagnetic field&quot;</p>

<p>This is totally true, but it does nothing to indicate alien/reptilian/super-powerful interference beyond making it one possible (<em>very</em> low-ranking) answer to a question with many better potential hypotheses.</p>

<p>The number of external factors that can cause hallucination and other cognitive interference is huge.  Sleep paralysis, fans that oscillate at certain frequencies, etc. , and while EM interference is certainly on the list, there is no indication that it guided by anyone but humans.  I wouldn&#39;t dismiss out of hand, covert manipulation by humans because it fits within a historical logical and potentially provable framework.  Bringing in supernatural forces is pretty much assigning one&#39;s own interpretation arbitrarily and without evidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s ridiculous.  Saying not <em>all</em> mental illnesses are caused internally is one thing.

<p>You can view that there is something going on differently in the brain using an EEG, but this does not bring up the cause of the illness, and when viewing schizophrenia genetically, it&#39;s difficult to tell whether the person has schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  Again, you can view changes in the DNA that show that the person is suffering from this illness, but not the cause.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re still putting words in my mouth.  I&#39;m not saying to assume anything.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;offspring of people with an illness such as schizophrenia only have a 6.5% of developing the disorder themselves.&quot;  </p>

<p>So they&#39;re about 5 and 1/2 times as likely to be schizophrenic.  Thank you for validating the genetic and or psychological background points.</p>

<p>In some cases we don&#39;t know the cause, I&#39;m just responding to what I see (not specifically from you, but from people who seriously entertain alien/supernatural explanations ahead of rational, provable ones) as a serious failure to apply Occam&#39;s Razor or even common sense.  Not only are these alternative explanations far from the simplest, they are illogical.  Aliens communicate with humans and randomly interfere in their cognitive processes of random individuals in a chaotic and unproductive way?  According to the OP (I know you&#39;re not saying you believe him), they&#39;re trying to hinder human progress through the creation of psychopaths (given that he feels he is being interfered with, this would be a fruitful avenue for a clinical psychologist to pursue).  The alien human hybrid thing is ridiculous as any race that could get here would have the technology to manipulate us or destroy us far more efficiently.  And on and on and on.  </p>

<p>My point is not that he is wrong so the whole line of reasoning is wrong, my point is that every example of reasoning that leads in this direction is at least nearly as flawed as his.</p>

<p>These things are, in fact, possible, and their successes and failures have been recorded many times over.  It is only very recently (within the last 100 years or so) that people have started to attempt the use of the scientific method to experiment with these practices.  Unfortunately, the technical language of the occult has been given to the masses who have in turn made the most vulgar assumptions.  To really dive into this subject requires an exhaustive look at that map of the psyche known as the Hermetic Qabalah.  (Don&#39;t confuse the map for the territory!)</p>

<p>Precognition: commonly, this is imagined to be &quot;seeing the future,&quot; etc.  Real precognition is actually the manipulation of a map of a system to predict likely outcomes and trends which help educate the intuition and reasoning faculties.  To give a concrete example: there are some very successful economic and market analysts capable of making educated guesses regarding market trends based upon their experience, statistics, pattern recognition, and &quot;gut feeling&quot; (which may just be the subconscious &quot;bubbling&quot; up to the surface after processing the input given to it).  To use a more esoteric example: there are Tarot card readers that have a high rate of success (I know a few), and there are just as many, if not more, charlatans and quacks.  The successful Tarot divination is a whole other subject.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance: this ties in to precognition.  Clairvoyance is just seeing clearly.  This ability requires mental training (and a bit of natural talent) similar to that undergone by special intelligence agents.  One must be able to quickly assess a situation, and the more data available, the better the pattern recognition, etc.  To use a practical example: a Sr. level Systems or Network administrator will be able to quickly diagnose and analyze a problem, thanks in part to the wealthy of their experience, in ways far more efficient than their Jr. level staff.  Such Sr. level staff should be able to exercise wisdom and insight by seeing the &quot;bigger picture&quot; and how all of the moving parts fit together.</p>

<p>Astral Projection: as shocking as it may seem, the consciousness does not need to be bound to the biological matter of the brain/nervous system; at least, not all of the consciousness.  This is more difficult to explain to those that have not undergone psychedelic experiences.  Again, the need for rigorous scientific skepticism is essential to quantifying and qualifying any results (or lack thereof).  Astral Projection is (from one perspective) the ability to interact with abstractions of the psyche in a visual way which, on the surface, appears similar to day dreaming.  Gamers will probably recognize what I am talking about when they &quot;project&quot; themselves into a game and forget all about their physical body.  For me, this started to occur while playing RPGs; especially DnD, or any game that requires imagination to supply the visual elements.  If you have children, consider how fascinate they are by an empty box, and often they will chose to play with this cardboard box over their other toys.  Really, imagination is the crux of the whole deal.  Hence, the outward similarity to day dreaming.  Proficient astral projection also touches upon the technical aspects of Raja Yoga (stripped of any sectarian dogma); particularly, Dharana and Dhyana may result from intense &quot;Astral Travelling;&quot; sometimes, the phenomenon of Samadhi can also occur.</p>

<p>Those who are not highly trained in occult mysticism or magick may be inclined to quickly dismiss this message.  However, these practices, and many others, are reproducible by others when following rigorous methodologies (as laid out in various technical books on the subject, and I recommend &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot; by Aleister Crowley).  How can you be sure of objectivity?  You must keep a detailed record of all experiments, and the conditions surrounding them while honestly recording all failures and successes (and the failures are most likely to be more frequent than the initial successes!).</p>

<p>Not in scientifically controlled experiments.  Why does James Randi still have his $1,000,000 if someone could demonstrate such abilities in a controlled environment.  There are a ton of way to fake that kid of thing and no one can do it past occasional luck without &quot;cheating&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot; How can you be sure of objectivity?&quot;</p>

<p>A series of controls.  Uri Geller fooled researchers by having an accomplice subtly signal him about the image on a piece of paper he couldn&#39;t see; so no one else in contact with the person.  Thorough EM sweep of the person to detect and foreign device, etc, etc, etc.  Magicians are very clever and what you are describing is purely the realm of magicianship.  Watch Darren Brown&#39;s videos on YouTube.  He rarely specifies how he does it, but he assures the audience it is just tricks.  He can replicate any of those phenomenon, but a well controlled analytical environment would prevent him from accomplishing anything other than cold-reading and stage hypnosis.</p>

<p>As far as Crowley and the like, there results are/were achieved essentially through hypnosis and trauma based mental manipulation.  More or less, exploiting existing weaknesses in the human brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said the results were widely published.  It is unfortunate that stage illusionists and occult magicians both use Magic as the name of their practices: both schools are completely opposed in intent and methodology.  Stage illusionists have co-opted the name of Magic.  The number of charlatans is magnitudes higher than the number of legitimate adepts.  If the results of Crowley, Blavatsky, Motta, Bersson, and others are, in fact, the result of exploiting weaknesses in the human brain, then this is only encouragement to exploit them further.</p>

<p>No, no they will not (and when would the time be &quot;right&quot; anyway; mystical hogwash excuses).  Even if it existed as anything beyond mental manipulation, exposing it would be counterproductive for its practitioners.  And, since it <em>is</em> just mental manipulation and has been used primarily for propaganda, brainwashing, espionage, child abuse and blackmail, releasing said information would put many of its practitioners at serious risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me again.  I think life in other star systems is almost assured.  However, that they have made contact with us is highly improbable.</p>

<p>Take for example, the fact that basic life forms developed on earth very early in the life-span of our planet, and within mere hundreds of millions of years developed into complex animals.</p>

<p>There are probably other intelligent species out there, but if we ever meet them, it will likely be our robots meeting theirs.</p>

<p>Carl Sagan&#39;s estimate of the sentient species in the Milky Way (based on the Drake equation) was was ~1,000,000.  Sadly, neither you nor I will live to see the correct answer,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d disagree that the mind isn&#39;t capable of doing something of this magnitude to itself.  The human brain is something we don&#39;t fully grasp yet and is perfectly capable of amazing things like amnesia, repression, active denial, schizophrenia, nightmares, and demonic visions. I wouldn&#39;t rule out the mind.</p>

<p>However...I want to believe you.  I really do.  The only thread keeping me from saying you&#39;re a schizophrenic and dismissing you is the fact my identical twin brother and I have both had what we consider to be abduction experiences.  Missing time, implantation of devices, encounters with strange not-quite-human beings checking up on us from time to time.  The experiences were <strong>probably</strong> just our combined imagination, but a small part of me believes it was real.  I&#39;ll probably get shit for it because this is Reddit, but for what its worth - the small, tiny corner in the back of my mind that actually believes I was abducted...believes you.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, this is quite the curious post. There are only a handful of possibilities:</p>

<p>1) This is a troll post. Which seems quite possible because it has everything: world leaders are psychopaths, world leaders are aliens, world leaders are reptilian, guy wants a fucking tinfoil hat, guy claims to be abducted.. etc. It&#39;s a laundry list of generic ideas. Also, bullshit on taking large quantities of sedating drugs (that all can have dangerous interactions with one another) and have no change.</p>

<p>2) This guy is in serious need of psychological help. If he&#39;s been able to elevate his imagination so far as to have a physiological &quot;guard&quot; against strong medicines, then asking him questions that re-inforce this fantasy and offer him a strong podium to share the fantasy would be a very dangerous idea. It could only push him further into the psychosis. </p>

<p>Lets find out!</p>

<p>Are all psychopaths these reptillians? What about the psychopaths that do not hurt people physically or have power? The type that just break into post offices to lick stamps and go to jail continuously. Is a person with a significant decrease of conscious in individuals that allow them ability to work with limited emotion also reptilians/greys? </p>

<p>Also, if they are feeding you ideas, how do we know you wrote this post, and not them writing through you to scare us? Make us paranoid? Force us into a crushing fear?</p>

<p><em>I think</em> they are just hybrids/genetically modified. Science might prove this in the future. They are mostly human physically, but definitely fucked up in the head and their brain chemistry is different.</p>

<p>Psychopaths are still dangerous... I&#39;d recommend doing some research on them. They cause a lot of turmoil in anyone they have relations with. They are very scary people. 15% of people in jail/prison or psychopaths.. and they are supposedly 1% of the population.</p>

From the posts mocking you, to people believing you, there&#39;s tons of negative energy for these aliens. How can you assure us that it is you trying to help, and not them trying to feed?</p>

<p>If they pretend they are gods, is it possible they have been watching over humans for thousands and thousands of years, causing wars and genocide. Perhaps they helped create all the religions on earth. Religions have been instrumental in causing wars and chaos, favorable conditions for &quot;negative energy&quot;. Perhaps the christian concept of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; was one of their psychopaths?</p>

I have my thoughts and theories on God, and I think if I told you them, you&#39;d be pretty pleased with how logical it is and my concept of Him does promote faith. I do believe there is some intelligent design in all of this. I think aliens are walking the road to perdition.</p>

<p>I actually have faith in a higher power, and I&#39;m pretty sure all these aliens are going to Hell, as well as psychopaths.</p>

<p>Psychopaths are self-pleasers. They would have no interest in sharing knowledge or trying to help people without anything in return. In fact they try to inflict as much pain and suffering as possible on others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your questions:</p>

<p>First of all, please rule out both your hypotheses. I&#39;m not trolling, and I&#39;ve had intensive psychological treatment including lengthy hospital stays. </p>

<p><em>You&#39;re missing the third possibility, which is that I&#39;m telling the truth and not delusional.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>world leaders are psychopaths, world leaders are aliens, world leaders are reptilian</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not even say that in my post. I personally don&#39;t think most of our leaders are psychopaths. Psychopaths don&#39;t think they are aliens... but they do think they&#39;re &quot;special&quot; or &quot;Godly&quot;. I&#39;d say they are more like the Devil. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>guy wants a fucking tinfoil hat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tinfoil hats don&#39;t work. I desperately want these fuckers to stop mind-reading me. Have a better idea than the Velostat hat (there&#39;s a link to it in the post)? It looks like it might work. Say evil entities are communicating with you. I think you&#39;d try to find out how to stop it... and based on my research aliens mind-read by using electromagnetic fields and advanced technology.. at least this is a popular hypothesis and I&#39;d like to see if it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>I do know they are smart enough to make me look insane to the casual observer. Which is incredibly depressing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>guy claims to be abducted.. etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve looked up other abduction accounts, and most say that are teleported to some alien spaceship and they get a good look at the aliens. Most say the aliens are interested in our reproductive systems, as they don&#39;t have any. Supposedly that&#39;s why they create hybrids - to reproduce. I personally didn&#39;t have this experience.. it was all telepathic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, bullshit on taking large quantities of sedating drugs (that all can have dangerous interactions with one another) and have no change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t taken them all at once. My psychiatrist prescribes one after another. You&#39;re fucking retarded in thinking a psychiatrist would dope me up on all these drugs at the same time - they&#39;d lose their license and I would probably be dead.</p>

<p>Ok I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>When you look at the universe and the possibility of other life, nearly all people who comment on this seem to forget the time scale of the cosmos. The age of the universe and the time periods involved in how old planets/galaxies are is unfathomable. As we can see on earth, a sentient species takes a - lets say - 10,000 years to go from first intelligent behavior to the age of industry. In the grand scale of time this is <strong>nothing</strong>. 10k years is absolutely pitiful and passes by in a blink of an eye, figuratively speaking. </p>

<p>Is there other life in the universe? Most certainly so. Is it life that we would recognize / be able to interact with? Highly unlikely. Why? Because any intelligent species would evolve at an accelerated rate, reaching the singularity and becoming a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Type_I">type-1</a> civilization. Even a type-2 or type-3. And any such civilization would be way past meddling with the affairs of single type-0 worlds. It would simply be ridiculous. Other lifeforms would be hundreds of thousands of years older, or billions of years. Or they could be the same age as us, in which case they do not have interstellar travel, or extradimensional travel either. For all the things you claim to be true it would have to be the biggest cosmic one-armed bandit jackpot of all time. It would be more likely that in the next 12 hours, a cosmic shower of meteors will simultaneously appear, striking and killing every person on earth with freckles on the right side of their face.</p>

<p>You are personifying unknown (supposedly) alien entities with human qualities. Evil, depressed, demonic. You don&#39;t need this subreddit, you need better help. Or alternatively, master lucid dreaming and confront and destroy these &#39;aliens&#39;. But you need to break the delusions somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;God&#39; is simply an entity trying to <em>capitalize</em> on any foolish human willing to give them the authority they desire.</p>

<p>There are countless, literally more entities with various degrees of integrity/intelligence than human beings can comprehend or count.  We <em>can</em> categorize them and organize the massive amounts of data into workable systems of information.</p>

<p>Entities people often refer to as &#39;gods&#39; are usually a specific type of entity that claims authority and power(s).  They are usually associated with mountains and caves (on mountains).  They feed on human worship, energy and attention.</p>

<p>Ask yourself, what is a &#39;grey&#39; and why are you giving your energy and time to entities that are &#39;evil&#39; and &#39;stupid&#39;?</p>

<p>Why should I even give you the time of day if you give your time and energy to these types of entities?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have very strong experiences with Psychopaths, but in my case its because of money and decades long alcoholism. Scary stuff.</p>

<p>The mind is a very powerful thing that science knows little about as yet.</p>

<p>About 20 years ago with some friends we got our hands on an anti psychotic drug called Procyclidine. I took eight of them. I ended up speaking to parking meters (amongst other things) very early in the morning, I did so with growing frustration as I was the only one doing the talking, I thought this very rude, I ended up kicking a bunch of them in my frustration. I must have looked a sight!</p>

<p>You mentioned that you have or are doing lots of drugs, some legally issued and you made a hint of others that might be illegal.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust any of your thoughts until you are completely clean, healthy and fit. Do some yoga, exercise, don&#39;t drink, make sure to eat well, plenty of nutrients from raw vegetables, less meat, reduce intake of processed food, and drink plenty of water. And do so for at least a year.</p>

<p>Until you do so you CANNOT trust your thoughts as you CANNOT guarantee their veracity.</p>

<p>I think mathematically there has to be other life forms in the universe but equally the probability that these are directly communicating with you is very very slim.</p>

<p>You wont know this for sure until you are completely free from any outside crap, and for some time.</p>

<p>Good luck and all the best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it funny that you want to try DMT to fix it. The first time I had a breakthrough experience I was confronted by a grey alien who proceeded to probe my third eye and show me DNA. I don&#39;t know how much you know about the drug, but it is described as a &quot;fourth dimensional&quot; world. At the time it honestly feels like that. I had &quot;alien contact&quot; on psilocin before as well that was a vision of two greys sending another grey through a wormhole to become religious leaders here etc. I take it all with a grain of salt. I find those types of visions and the psychedelic experience fascinating, but I by know means fully believe the things you see on psychedelics. That type of mindset makes it easy to smear the line between coincedence and synchronicty, given one even exists. I basically just wanted to share this with you for the sake of your sanity. I honestly found it kind of strange that you talked about aliens existing in the fourth dimension as &quot;hyperspace&quot;, as some would call it is the only place I&#39;ve ever seen them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting.... My father has some sort of schizophrenic disorder that he has never gotten treatment for. He says that there is a demon&#39;s/dead guy&#39;s voice that is ALWAYS telling him to do evil things. My father has randomly told me this on some of his drunk rants.... that and I can hear him yelling at the voice every once in a while. I&#39;ve never talked to him about it in detail because it just seemed too personal to talk about even though he is my father. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what it could be that he&#39;s hearing, but my guesses are that he is either actually schizophrenic, being tormented by a demon/dead guy (because that&#39;s what he says it is), HAARP (because he coincidentally looks in the direction of Alaska when he yells at the voice in his head), or now that I&#39;ve seen this, it could be aliens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I got out of your message here is that you are tormented by something that feels outside of you. It could be frustrating to exist in a time when we (humans on Earth) don&#39;t know much about what our brains are capable of apart from anecdotal or subjective evidence. Mental health studies are relatively new, and society at large is quick to label, ostracize and condemn people who express views such as yours. As DoctorMiracles said at the top, I hope you find some relief. I hope you are able to find some one whom you can trust, perhaps, and find a way, if it&#39;s what you&#39;d like, to feel free from what troubles you. I appreciated reading your post but feel obligated to tell you that I agree with some other comments; the appropriate medical professional and correct dosage and type of medication are the best tools your fellow man can offer to help you feel at ease at this time on Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! Thanks for having the time and courage to post something like this.</p>

<p>Question: I would just like to know your opinion on hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms, Iboga and Ayahuasca/DMT.</p>

<p>Comment: Many people who seem to have the intellectual maturity of 8 year olds have suggested you try medication to stop thinking in the way that you do, it just made me curious as to why they are posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at all, and second of all if they ignorant to the fact that several years of psychotherapeutic (medicated aswell) treatment can achieve about the same as a monitored, controlled heavy psychedelic trip.</p>

<p>Also for those wanting to know the difference between what psychology defines as Schizophrena and the phenomena of channeling/mediumship, you should check out a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/PRESENCE-OTHER-WORLDS-PSYCHOLOGICAL-SWEDENBORG/dp/0877853126">&#39;The Presence of Other Worlds&#39;</a>. The level of ignorance / denial on this threat is immense....</p>

And also, no. The thought screen helmet does not work, I can drill through it to get to your brain. I know this because way back in 1998 I tested my control of someone wearing such a device. Once you poke through, its actually easier to maintain control, because it acts as focus.</p>

<p>The idea that humans are special or even close to the most complex of beings has roots in Christian dogma.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you generalize your statement to the extent that you do really does invalidate much of what you have to say.  For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens are remorseless, soulless assholes with advanced technology and are keeping a very close watch on Earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude.  Seriously.  Do you know how backward a statement this is?  You say the word &quot;aliens&quot; in such a manner as to generalize your statement to ALL species not from planet Earth.  Have you ANY idea whatsoever that there are <em>countless</em> extraterrestrial species in the cosmos?  You say &quot;all&quot; and yet obviously have no idea that, while some are indeed malevolent to humanity and couldn&#39;t care less about the welfare of the human species, there are many that are consummately benevolent and would never do anything of the sort.  Therefore, your generalities speak of a pretty advanced level of ignorance on your part.</p>

<p>Realize that existence and reality are a LOT more vast and varied than the manner that you are thinking of.  This planet has some off world species on it that are indeed not very nice.  However, not only does it also have some that are so much more benevolent, loving, and advanced than humans that it makes your statement seem embarrassing, but even the reptilians that you speak so demonically of have members that would absolutely shock you with their level of benevolence.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Understand that evil is a relative thing that depends upon ones vantage point.  While I&#39;m not here to defend Reptilians, I will say that Reptilians, for example, aren&#39;t seen as evil to fellow Reptilians.  To many humans?  They are indeed seen as very intimidating, but, again, this is a relative perspective - not an absolute one.  Think about the fact that humans - to many other humans - are looked upon as positive beings that want love and constructive, helpful things in life.</p>

<p>To a cow, however?  Humans are looked upon as nothing but the very epitome of evil itself - and rightfully so based upon how we overwhelmingly treat them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all perspective.  Again, I&#39;m not here to try to defend Reptilians, but you need to be real certain what you mean by the word &quot;evil&quot; before you go classifying and labeling really anything as such because things are rarely exactly how they seem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I some benevolent species can contact me, they haven&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, again, is very fair.  You have to NOT paint everything in existence by the paintbrush that only <em>you</em> have experienced in your life, however.  To say that &quot;every Alien is evil&quot; because <em>you</em> had a few experiences with Reptilians that you ended up interpreting as less than positive does not at all equate with &quot;[all] Aliens are remorseless, soulless assholes&quot; (wtf?).  Don&#39;t do that because a very limited amount of experiences do not to any extent whatsoever represent how the totality of all off world beings are.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t belive how close-minded you people are. You are too busy with something, that you dont have time to enrichen yourself with the facts you need. I mean, you just sit here and want all the facts to be explained to you, and even if someone gives you some sort of a fact, you tend to disagree with it. Why not for once, just stand up and farm the facts yourself, then you will tend to believe them way more.</p>

<p>Ahh, forget about that, you cant help this person at all. You are not this kind of community he needs help from. You are just making the situation worse for him.</p>

<p>No medication nor therapy will help (I dont count them as treatments anyway). The only thing most likely to help him is to talk with the right people, open-minded enough to accept him as a normal person. I&#39;ve been visiting communities where &quot;crazy people&quot;, as you might say, reside. And do you know what? The people there look upon those &quot;crazy people&quot; as people from which they can learn something new, not as people which have some form of a desiese.</p>

<p>6iodux, I liked your post, but if you want to go into deeper conversation about this, this is not the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is a lie and they know it.  Have they ever deceived you in the past?  Also, please ask them this question specifically, &quot;Do you acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh?&quot; Have you read much about the Nephilim? </p>

<p>John 4:1-4</p>

<p>1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>

<p>2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</p>

<p>3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</p>

<p>4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</p>

<p>edit: If you truly want these entities gone, you need to submerse yourself in the Bible.  As others in this thread have commented there are only two types of beings, those from God and those from Lucifer (Baal, Satan).  Demons cannot inhabit or torment a Christian who is walking with God.  Do me a favor and start reading the Bible and talking to them about Jesus and see what happens.  You have to call on Jesus, bottom line.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello OP,</p>

<p>These entities you encounter are demons. They masquerade as aliens and attempt to sabotage your understanding of God. If you ward them away in the name of Jesus Christ, seriously, they will go away. Even if you believe you have been abducted, and you believe you are currently on an alien ship in the middle of surgery, you can command them to leave you alone, in the name of Jesus Christ, and you will end up back in the real world.</p>

<p>These entities operate through hallucinations and delusions. They operate through your own mind. In most cases they cannot affect you unless you are in some kind of altered state: hypnosis, lucid dreams, sleep paralysis, out of body experiences, meditative trances, dissociative and psychedelic drug experiences, those types of things. In some cases, if you have a history of messing around with occult stuff, magick, rituals, incantations, enchantments, sigils etc., these entities will gain more power over you, and they will not require an altered state of consciousness to interact with you. This is happening to people on a large scale, everywhere - this is how I can easily recognize what is happening to you.</p>

<p>If you believe in Jesus Christ and choose to accept him as your savior - i.e. like a Christian is supposed to - then the &quot;abduction&quot; experiences will <strong>stop completely</strong> (this is also true of sleep paralysis, as well as any other recurring episodes where these &quot;hallucinated&quot; demonic entities appear)</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this is not convenient or &quot;cool&quot; to hear but this is 100% true, I have <em>plenty</em> of knowledge on this subject and I know <em>exactly</em> what it is. I will answer questions if you or anybody has any questions, maybe I have answers, maybe I don&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alienresistance.org/ce4.htm">Here is the website of a research group</a> which talks more about terminating the experiences by the name of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>P.S. I&#39;m a psychopath irl - I&#39;m not a reptile and the Holy Spirit of God healed me and gave me a conscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice one thanks for posting this. You are 100% correct in saying that they are &#39;sentient spirit entities who have no material form&#39; - I would just like to add that the material and conscious form they take on, and what makes these beings exist is entirely made up of human ideas and thoughts, but that&#39;s the only place they <em>need</em> to exist.</p>

<p>Someone in another culture experiencing the same thing would associate different &#39;demons&#39; or entities, but it sounds like OP is definately from a Christian/Catholic background or upbringing so the manifestation that these entities take on immediately takes the form of a Christian demonic logos.</p>

<p>I believe concepts are real things, well maybe not real but they certainly exist in some way. This applies to deities, spirits, ghosts, ED&#39;s... whatever. Whether they &#39;exist&#39; to the point of a reductionist empirical satisfactory level is not the point, they exist purely in conceptual form - hence:</p>

<p>What kind of proof, exactly, were you after beyond the Jungian perspective that contact with these beings is purely a mental self-imposed delusion? Whether they&#39;re real or not is not the point - they&#39;re real <em>enough</em>.</p>

<p>If you have been lead to believe that all these spirits, entities and similar beings are purely evil and demonic then you are indeed a sheep, and not a Christed Lion. The True Christ would never fear or doubt or judge others, as fear is only born of ignorance. It is true that ignorance is the only evil my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with both you and Autocoprophage to an extent. These are demonic entities and minions of Lucifer, who is part of the One True God, as we all are. But i disagree with the argument that they are evil, because evil like time is relative and a matter of perspective. There is no being in this or any other universe that says to itself &quot;I&#39;m going to be evil and do disgusting things simply for the sake of evil&quot;. They as well as us, are all trying to do good. But there is 2 different kinds of good. There&#39;s the I&#39;m going to help myself by helping others mentality, and then there is the I&#39;m going to look after me and mine so fuck everyone else line of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice one thanks for chiming in FluidDruid. I&#39;d like to post this, as I think it&#39;s entirely relevant to what you said.</p>

<p><em>[..] the Sefer Yezirah draws the important conclusion that &quot;good and evil&quot; have no real existence, for since everything in nature can exist only by means of its contrast, a thing may be called good or evil according to its influence over man by the natural course of the contrast. [..] While the ideas of heaven and hell are left unmentioned in the book, it teaches that the virtuous man is rewarded by a favorable attitude of nature, while the wicked man finds it hostile to him.</em></p>

<p>Well good luck segregation, negativity and judgement of your fellow brothers, while just trying to add to the discourse on this thread your reality tunnel of claiming to be the Authority on Christ is disturbing to say the least and I wish you luck and all the best in overcoming the egocentricity of your current paradigm.</p>

<p>Self proclaimed Authority is not enough to stamp out the clear and obvious similarities between the teachings of Mohammad, Krishna, Abraham, Buddha, Thoth, Zeus, Jesus and many more. <strong>May the power of all these Christed entities continue to lead all those on the path of Spirituality, those in service to the Lord, to remember and return to true Oneness</strong> - a condition you &#39;Autocoprophage&#39; are determined to be the &#39;authority on&#39; and to exploit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;offspring of people with an illness such as schizophrenia only have a 6.5% of developing the disorder themselves.&quot;  </p>

<p>So they&#39;re about 5 and 1/2 times as likely to be schizophrenic.  Thank you for validating the genetic and or psychological background points.</p>

<p>In some cases we don&#39;t know the cause, I&#39;m just responding to what I see (not specifically from you, but from people who seriously entertain alien/supernatural explanations ahead of rational, provable ones) as a serious failure to apply Occam&#39;s Razor or even common sense.  Not only are these alternative explanations far from the simplest, they are illogical.  Aliens communicate with humans and randomly interfere in their cognitive processes of random individuals in a chaotic and unproductive way?  According to the OP (I know you&#39;re not saying you believe him), they&#39;re trying to hinder human progress through the creation of psychopaths (given that he feels he is being interfered with, this would be a fruitful avenue for a clinical psychologist to pursue).  The alien human hybrid thing is ridiculous as any race that could get here would have the technology to manipulate us or destroy us far more efficiently.  And on and on and on.  </p>

<p>My point is not that he is wrong so the whole line of reasoning is wrong, my point is that every example of reasoning that leads in this direction is at least nearly as flawed as his.</p>
