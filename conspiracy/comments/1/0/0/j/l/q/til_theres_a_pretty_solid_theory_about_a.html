    <div class="md"><p>Also  - there is a book called &quot;You&#39;ll Never Make Love in This Town Again&quot; written by two former call girls. </p>

<p>Dark, dark reading. Lots of powerful names. Warren Beatty, George Harrison, Sly Stallone, Don Simpson, Oj Simpson, Billy Idol, Vanna White, Jack Nicholson. It was written in the nineties. </p>

<p>Spoiler: Jack Nicholson comes off Ok. Sly Stallone likes girls to poop on him. Don Simpson is evil as fuck. Oh, and a rather amusing George Harrison story. </p>

<p>Edit: One thing that struck me about the book is how the girls were ALWAYS over awed by material bullshit. There would be descriptions of opulence  - which they were super impressed by - then some vicious S&amp;M shit. But they kept going back because they seemed so impressed by the fame, money and power. For this reason, they lost my sympathy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have always been actresses and actors in Hollywood who put out, or had to put out, to get roles.  Various straight and gay producers had casting couches. But there has always also been a pedo segment too.</p>

<p>The term &quot;Model-actress-whatever&quot; was coined to describe women who put out to get parts and maybe make cash on the side hooking. The whole town has always has a really seamy side since the early days.  There&#39;s always been discrete and not so discrete word about it all. But anyone who wants to not get shut out or banned kept their mouth shut. I&#39;d say the stories about kids being offered up for sex, or getting raped, have a basis. Some big stars have been raped - Natalie Wood for example - when they were young and naive. Some Disney stars too. On top of all that, some highest level politicians have used children - read about the Franklin coverup and some pimps of Hollywood supplied them. It&#39;s all ugly.</p>

<p>Most actresses are narcissists. Hate to say it but it&#39;s true. Malignant narcissists. They are so obsessed with fame - as they are entitled to it after all, according to their world view - they deserve it. Obscurity HORRIFIES them. They crave fame, like the body craves sleep or water. THEY MUST HAVE IT. I call them fame zombies. </p>

<p>Megan Fox is interesting, because she played herself in The Dictator and played a scene where she slept with &quot;The Dictator&quot; for money. So essentially she outed herself as a Hollywood trash bag. </p>

<p><em>On 27 June 2012, Barclays Bank was fined $200 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,[29] $160 million by the United States Department of Justice[30] and £59.5 million by the Financial Services Authority[31] for attempted manipulation of the Libor and Euribor rates.[32] The United States Department of Justice and Barclays officially agreed that &quot;the manipulation of the submissions affected the fixed rates on some occasions&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The things I experienced and heard were run of the mill in Hollywood. But totaly &quot;WTF&quot; to regular plebs like us. </p>

<p>A few things I know for sure.
 - There is always this expectation you will sleep with people. When you don&#39;t they think you are being difficult. Nobody likes difficult. I was difficult because I did not submit - I questioned things and this vexed them. You have to understand that most girls are culturally programmed by society to want fame and money. Therefore they are easy to control.</p>

<p>They also like malleable. You can&#39;t be a switched on person. You must be available to their psychological techniques. If you resist them, or their little mind tricks don&#39;t work - it annoys them. They LOVE POWER OVER PEOPLE.</p>

<p>All this sick S&amp;M shit can be explained like this. <em>They don&#39;t feel emotions like normal people</em>. They genuinely can&#39;t feel joy. They feel nothing. They don&#39;t see a picture of a cute internet cat and go d&#39;awww. They have zero capacity to &quot;d&#39;awww&quot;. </p>

<p>They only way they can feel anything is if they get the shit beaten out of them. S&amp;M is the only way they can feel anything. They are numb. Void on the inside. </p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t there been any Hollywood whistleblower ( or more than the Feldman&#39;s and Todd Bridges)? Because they think we ( being general population people) are dumb fucks leading, simple little lives. We are pathetic to them. We are the faceless other. THey are superior because they have fast cars and cool parties and yachts and drugs and unlimited sex. They are all choked up on Class A drugs and prescription pills. Like I said - they feel NOTHING. </p>

<p>They think emotions are irrational. Un-evolved. To feel things to experience emotion is a cave man quality. They are superior because they can rise about their animal nature. To feel no emotion is to be free. Therefore, they are more evolved than the rest of us. </p>

<p>To be honest  - it is an interesting philosophical debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem, I agree with you that adults having consensual sex is not a problem. The problem, is that sex being used against women in Hollywood is a big problem. Many actresses have come forth with details about being asked to perform sexual acts in return for movie roles. Now, they aren&#39;t being raped, but the issue is that if we don&#39;t call this shit out, it will continue to dilute what moviemaking aims to be; an artistic medium, and at the very least entertainment and escapism.</p>

<p>This has been a problem since the beginning of Hollywood, but it doesn&#39;t mean that it should be allowed to continue. Many people people are angry with the sexism and ageism prevalent in our pop culture (have you heard of the Bechdel test?) and exchanging sexual favors for roles is harmful to our culture. Young girls are more and more obsessed with being rich and famous, and instead of prizing talent and hard work, hollywood prizes BJ skills and a hard body.</p>

<p>The issue isn&#39;t that an actress has sex with a director/producer for a role, the problem is that it&#39;s harmful to the medium of film itself, and it perpetuates an unhealthy work environment and mentality, and unhealthy obsession with beauty and &#39;fuckability.&#39;</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;ve talking about the &#39;casting couch&#39; issue, but my OP was about a prostitution ring. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem, it (allegedly) involves girls that are being preyed on, girls that come from broken homes, and girls that have parents that are too caught up in being &#39;stage parents&#39; than having their child&#39;s best interest at heart. Prostitution is not bad in and of itself, however, an underground prostitution ring selling actresses and models to the highest bidder contributes to sexism and misogyny in hollywood, by furthering the stereotype of actresses not being anything else but basically a talking vagina and tits. The problem is deeper than a prostitution ring, it&#39;s a problem because it creates and continues to solidify and industry where women are encouraged to be nothing but receptacles.</p>

<p>Okay, hopefully I&#39;m making sense and you&#39;re following me here. How am I linking casting couches and prostitution? The main issue comes down to a prevalent and toxic superficiality and anti-intellectualism that permeates our culture, which is in turn heavily influenced by pop culture. Instead of encouraging young women to strive to change the world and contribute to humanity, they are encouraged to be catty, skinny, fuckable, rich. The fact that so many girls strive to be famous in hollywood (because being famous has been designated as being a desirable trait, more so than being smart) will contribute to them selling themselves sexually, whether it&#39;s for a role, or for money.</p>

<p>Now, prostitution, pure prostitution is not wrong at all; when it&#39;s understood to be nothing but a financial transaction. Prostitution is wrong in Hollywood because fame is such a prevalent desire for many impressionable young people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If somebody proved that this was all 100 percent true, would it make any difference in our lives?</p>

<p>It might not make a difference to you, but it definitely would make a difference to people that aspire to be &#39;Hollywood.&#39; It would make a difference as a parent, knowing that if my child chose to pursue fame, he/she would be at risk of being taken advantage of.</p>

<p>If someone wants to be a prostitute, that&#39;s fine. When someone is exchange sex for fame, that&#39;s a big problem, because again, fame is way too much of a priority in our culture. </p>

<p>I would compare an actress fucking for a part, like buying a diamond. By fucking for the part, or buying a diamond, you don&#39;t see the repercussions of that act. You don&#39;t see the miners putting themselves in danger to perpetuate a culture that values a shiny piece of carbon, just like you don&#39;t see the girl trying to be skinny and sexy and desirable, so she becomes loved by the public, instead of maybe valuing her brain. </p>

<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best thing I have read on reddit. Ever. It erodes the spirits of women. It reduces us to - like you said - tits pussy and mouth. Nothing matters beyond that. Nothing. </p>

<p>In Hollywood the mysogyny is so fucking malignant it is so sewn into the fabric of reality that it is impossible to circumvent. And impossible to challenge. </p>

<p>At least in the middle east they are upfront and honest about their misogyny. They don&#39;t try and hide it. But in Hollywood it is a wicked, wicked game. Which in my opinion makes it more repellent then any bullshit medieval religion can invoke. </p>

<p>I agree, so much. So, so many people are under the impression that misogyny is in the past and that we&#39;re beyond it, but when you realize how many fans (!!) Chris Brown has, you realize how toxic it is. </p>
