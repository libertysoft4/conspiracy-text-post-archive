    <div class="md"><p>The whole thing seems very fishy. First a bunch of Zionists make a hit-and-run video to provoke Muslims against U.S. and then conveniently at the same time  appears a &quot;private owner&quot; who sells the islands to Japan&#39;s government resulting in riots in China. Then when the matter is attempted to settle down diplomatically, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/16/japan-china-envoy-idUSL3E8KG07F20120916">Japan&#39;s ambassador mysteriously dies</a>. And of course most these things are missed by the Western media because all attention is concentrated on the rioting Muslims. The right questions to ask in a situation like this is not &#39;how&#39; but &#39;why&#39; and &#39;who would profit from this&#39;?</p>

<p>Btw. Does anyone know who was the private owner who sold the islands?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres my answer...</p>

<p>The U.S Dollar is failing, the chinda and russian markets are pushing it farther and farther away from a point of return, and we are about to go into a war. The only smart economic choice the U.S has is what we did during the great depression. We need a massive war, so big that it will jump start our economy or completely destroy us. If we leave China and Russia out of this war, they will reap the profits, and leave us to hang. We need something that draws them in. The U.S used Japan to provoke china, hopefully japan and china will start fighting (this isn&#39;t very hard to do, with their backgrounds..) Between china and japan, india will jump in, since it has such a huge amount of money linked with the two, russia will jump in when we go into iran, Britain will help us and Israel, France will stick with Syria and iran, Lebanon and Kuwait will help us, because we have them by their balls. </p>

<p>This is going to lower the amount of oil we are consuming, by directly raising the cost. I&#39;m sure with the skyrocketing prices the U.S will probably do another save gas program like during WW2. People will start losing jobs, the dollar will start to crash. But then, as every economy slows down during war, our dollar will decline at a slower rate, allowing more time to build up by offering jobs for the upcoming war. I have a feeling Obama cannot do all this, it has to be Romney. He will most likely  start by supporting israel.   </p>

<p>Who profits? The same people that always do, the banks. 
Why? To slow our economic downfall.
How? Poking at the beast </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I looked quite a bit into it. What I found is just greed and a mountain of human stupidity.</p>

<p>It seems that islands were first time officially explored and claimed in 1900&#39;s by Koga Tatsushirō, from who the islands were seized by U.S. during the WW2 and returned back afterwards. This also marked the end of WW2 (it would be very ironic if it would also mark the beginning of WW3). In the 70&#39;s Tatsuhirō&#39;s descendents sold some of the islands to Kurihara family, who <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/303520/japan-owner-of-disputed-islands-wants-to-sell">have been leasing the islands to Japanese government</a>. </p>

<p>The dispute here is all about money and resources. <a href="http://jcp.or.jp/english/jps_2010/20101004_senkaku.html">No one made any objections for 75 years against Japan claiming the ownership</a> until in the 1969 potential oil and gas reserves were discovered. China then began claiming that Senkaku islands belonged to the Island of Formosa (Taiwan) which Japan unjustly seized during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War">first Sino-Japanese War</a>.</p>

<p>The conflict that is going on now started some months ago when a <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/719973/China-holding-back-strength-over-Diaoyu-Islands-for-now.aspx">Taiwanese ship with activists boarded the islands and proclaimed they belonged to China</a>. Other than people (<a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120706000016&amp;amp;cid=1101">including some city counselor</a>) being patriotic and stupid enough to do something like that, it&#39;s a tad weird that Taiwanese activists raised Chinese (PRC) flag rather than flag of Taiwan (ROC). This they later admitted was a simple mistake due to their alleged incapability of acquiring the right flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why?</p>

<p>Probably due to the fact that the MSM is absolutely being saturated with Zionist war propaganda.</p>

<p>The entire morning, Fox news has had nothing but stock footage of Iranian missile tests, clips of Nut and Yahoo&#39;s war mongering interview, and veiled xenophobia.</p>

<p>We are going to war folks, whether we like it or not.  Once Israel strikes IRan, Iran will retaliate by striking Israel and US bases, thus begins World War Z(ion).  Start stocking up on canned goods and potable water if you haven&#39;t already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me start this off by saying that this isn&#39;t going to turn into a war. (not to break up with conspiracy circle jerk)</p>

<p>Do some research on Dokdo Island (South Korea) and Japanese, and the tension that place has.</p>

<p>The only logical thing I can think of is China trying to stop Japan from expanding its trade routes on the sea. When you own a portion of sea that trade-ships have to travel through, you are subject to their rules, their taxes. The fact that it was privately owned before disallowed Japan from enforcing regulations (because the land wasn&#39;t technically theirs).</p>

<p>The reason Japan says Dokdo is theirs? -Trade Routes.</p>

<p>The reason China says Senkaku is theirs? -Trades Routes.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t circle-jerk this into war war war.. Although I know <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> enjoys that kind of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I looked quite a bit into it. What I found is just greed and a mountain of human stupidity.</p>

<p>It seems that islands were first time officially explored and claimed in 1900&#39;s by Koga Tatsushirō, from who the islands were seized by U.S. during the WW2 and returned back afterwards. This also marked the end of WW2 (it would be very ironic if it would also mark the beginning of WW3). In the 70&#39;s Tatsuhirō&#39;s descendents sold some of the islands to Kurihara family, who <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/303520/japan-owner-of-disputed-islands-wants-to-sell">have been leasing the islands to Japanese government</a>. </p>

<p>The dispute here is all about money and resources. <a href="http://jcp.or.jp/english/jps_2010/20101004_senkaku.html">No one made any objections for 75 years against Japan claiming the ownership</a> until in the 1969 potential oil and gas reserves were discovered. China then began claiming that Senkaku islands belonged to the Island of Formosa (Taiwan) which Japan unjustly seized during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War">first Sino-Japanese War</a>.</p>

<p>The conflict that is going on now started some months ago when a <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/719973/China-holding-back-strength-over-Diaoyu-Islands-for-now.aspx">Taiwanese ship with activists boarded the islands and proclaimed they belonged to China</a>. Other than people (<a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120706000016&amp;amp;cid=1101">including some city counselor</a>) being patriotic and stupid enough to do something like that, it&#39;s a tad weird that Taiwanese activists raised Chinese (PRC) flag rather than flag of Taiwan (ROC). This they later admitted was a simple mistake due to their alleged incapability of acquiring the right flag.</p>
