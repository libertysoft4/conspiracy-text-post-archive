<p>But when it comes to Israeli relations India and Pakistan are worlds apart. India loves Israel and the two countries have a very strong relationship. Pakistan hates Israel and Pakistanis are always agitating against Israel. Why can&#39;t Pakistan just cut trade deals and do high tech R&amp;D  with Israel like India does? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947 by Great Britain. The Hindu population saw similarities between their case and the Zionist one, as both populations had their land divided amongst religious lines, both involving Muslim Nationalists. As is clear from history, when the empires fell, the lands were often handed over to leaders who will continue to represent the business interests of the foreign occupiers. Want control? Obey your former masters. Muslim Indians didn&#39;t want to live in a state with a Hindu leadership, fearing old grudges would make their way into everyday life for them. And vice-versa. You may say that Indians and Pakistanis are the same race and ethnicity (As are Bangladeshis), but obviously you know they don&#39;t see that. They are divided along national lines, and below that ancient Clans. Interestingly there is a growing relationship with between Israel and Pakistan. There exists a friendship society in Pakistan (wiki said it&#39;s in Lahore) Wiki also says Mossad and ISI teamed up once to harass the Soviets in the 80&#39;s. Apparently they have a backdoor relationship for a while now.  </p>

<p>While today Israel does $9 billion in mostly arms and technology trade with India, and Hindu Indians are very pro-Zionist, India does condemn Israeli war crimes. Political parties are often said to support Palestine in order to court Indian Islamic votes, I call that dumb. I highly doubt that if Islam voters in India are used to garner votes, I am sure they have bigger issues to worry about than the thousand miles away Palestinian problems. </p>

<p>Interesting questions you post. Thank you for posting your thoughts. I hope I can provide you with information. </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m asking why some countries hate Israel when other similarly situated countries, with similar histories, racial compositions, and comparable levels of economic development, are perfectly fine with Israel.</p>

<p>So far you&#39;ve utterly failed to explain the discrepancy. Your explanation (they just feel bad for the Palestinians) fails to explain the difference between, say, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>

<p>Note that that&#39;s the case EVEN IF your explanation is true. In other words, it could be true that Indonesians are genuinely upset over Israel&#39;s treatment of the Palestinians, but that would still not answer my question.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t.</p>

<p>To be fair, I already knew it before I started this thread. In fact it was your repeated failure to answer this same question in the other thread that prompted me to start this one. I predicted (correctly) that every other jew hater would fail to answer the question, just as you&#39;re failing to answer it here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A shared language and a lot of shared culture doesn&#39;t make ideologies the same. India and Pakistan don&#39;t get along on a lot of fronts and they have very different allies. While India was a pioneer of the non alignment movement, a lot of their biggest alliances are with western democracies. Pakistans biggest partner on the other hand is China. That in itself incurs some leanings towards or away from countries like Israel. India and Israel also exchange counterterrorism training and face similar techniques by those who would harm them, in that attacks are carried out by state sponsored terrorist organizations instead of countries themselves. So that circumstance also draws India and Israel together. And religion of course, I don&#39;t need to tell you about the Muslim vs Jew and Muslim vs Hindu mentality, India has a lot of Muslims (and lots of other religious minorities, all are tolorated) but is mainly Hindu, Pakistan is almost all Muslim. </p>

<p>So are Muslims just religious bigots?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all of them of course, but very often they seem to have unique problems mixing with other religions. India vs Pakistan is a perfect example. After partition, India has a wide wealth of religions, and a large chunk of Muslims granted all the same rights. Pakistan on the other hand is bad on minorities, and became almost completely Muslim.<br/>
You were angling for an answer like that for this whole thread, why not just say your opinion next time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just seems kind of ridiculous. Hindus are perfectly happy to let other people practice whatever religion they please, but Pakistan has to get all agitated over religious practices in a country 2000 miles away.</p>
