<p>In fact if they were really smart they would have saved the Jews and encouraged them to reproduce, since Jews tend to be well educated and productive and tend to grow the economies of places where they live.

<p>Naw, I make my own arguments. I even try to give arabs the benefit of the doubt. For example I looked at the wikipedia page on the &quot;Islamic golden age&quot; and the only real &quot;invention&quot; they list is &quot;a rudimentary sextant (known as a kamal).&quot; They didn&#39;t even invent a real sextant, just a RUDIMENTARY one.</p>

<p>Then I tried to look up a &quot;kamal&quot; and I found out it&#39;s just a piece of wood hanging from a string you hold in your mouth. It&#39;s a piece of fucking string, not a sextant.</p>

<p>I also remember looking up some geometrical problem that was supposedly &quot;solved&quot; by medieval islamic &quot;scientists&quot;. It was incomprehensible gibberish and even the post-colonial liberal academic who wrote it admitted there didn&#39;t seem to be an equation there but the diagram &quot;strongly suggested&quot; a solution somewhere else</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So what? They&#39;re still idiots who don&#39;t invent or produce anything useful. They just use western technology to harvest oil for sale and buy weapons from western countries.</p>

<p>Nope, I used wikipedia to look up all these supposed arab &quot;accomplishments.&quot; They&#39;re shit. They had some cool architecture apparently, but of course they didn&#39;t actually build the Hagia Sophia, they just tried to paint over it with silly claptrap about mohammed.</p>

<p>But ultimately my views on this topic are guided by a simple straightforward principle: resources ought to be accorded to the highest value user. That&#39;s straight up Scottish enlightenment. The only person who&#39;s really informed any of my thinking on any of this is David Hume.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When have I ever denied that? By now you have figured out I am nothing like most people you run into on this subject, so why you keep trying to rub &quot;The Arabs did it too!&quot; spiel out somewhere, too, but it just ain&#39;t stickin&#39;. Is it?</p>

<p>Why did Israel do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident">this?</a></p>

<p>So much for being on the cutting edge of technology when you can&#39;t even attack the right boat. Which is huge, BTW. Lemme guess: An Arab made the radar system, right? LOL! </p>

<p>This is way too easy. You are trying to defend Israel by pointing out all the bad shit they have done. You are sewing your own ass into a corner here.</p>

<p>Know why I&#39;m going to keep doing that? Because it hammers home the win in this argument for me. </p>

<p>And with that, I wish you a good night. You have unwittingly proven my point through the things you have said and asserted tonight, and I do wish to thank you.</p>

<p>Edit: Just a quick thought here. Are you, like, some sort of performance artist? Like, did you pick the Zionist hyperbole to impersonate in order to draw attention to the atrocities Israel has committed?</p>

<p>Well if not, thanks again for helping me point out how horrible Zionism really is and the sad state of the Palestinians day to day life. </p>

<p>No. If anything the crusades helped pull Europe out of the dark ages. The arab golden ages accomplished pathetically little. Once Europe hit the enlightenment they easily blew past the muslims, which is part of the reason why muslims are so angry today. I mean they&#39;re really just embarrassed.</p>

<p>What would have really advanced us technologically is if the western Roman empire had held up. They were on the verge of an industrial revolution in the 3rd century. Enlightenment Europe was essentially an attempt to reconstruct the old Roman civilization.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; in this case refers to Persians, not arabs. In fact most of the achievements attributed to arabs were actually accomplished by Persians, Turks, Berbers and Jews. Arabs themselves accomplished  very little outside their initial conquests, and even those were due primarily to the fact that byzantines did not build real fortifications against the deserts, since they never expected to be attacked from there. When arabs tried to leave the desert and fight the Franks they got their shit pushed in by Charles Martel, who wasn&#39;t even proper royalty at that point. And this was still in the 8th century, when the Franks still could not mount any effective defense against the Vikings!</p>

<p>&quot;The first century of the Islamic Arab Empire saw almost no scientific or mathematical achievements since the Arabs, with their newly conquered empire, had not yet gained any intellectual drive and research in other parts of the world had faded. In the second half of the 8th century, Islam had a cultural awakening, and research in mathematics and the sciences increased.[47] The Muslim Abbasid caliph al-Mamun (809–833) is said to have had a dream where Aristotle appeared to him, and as a consequence al-Mamun ordered that Arabic translation be made of as many Greek works as possible, including Ptolemy&#39;s Almagest and Euclid&#39;s Elements. Greek works would be given to the Muslims by the Byzantine Empire in exchange for treaties, as the two empires held an uneasy peace.[47] Many of these Greek works were translated by Thabit ibn Qurra (826–901), who translated books written by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius.[48]&quot;</p>

<p>A Persian may have hit on it, but it was an Islamic Caliph that took the initiative to revive it during the Islamic Golden age. It really started with the Greeks though.</p>

<p>The Greeks hit around on it, followed by a Persian that added a little more to it, then an Arab Caliph pushed it&#39;s development even further.</p>

<p>Except for the fact that modern Algebra came out of it?</p>

<p>Except for the fact that the IGA(Islamic Golden Age) brought to bear some of the most peaceful times for Jews and other people of the book. Maimonides <strong>lived</strong> in Caliphate Spain.</p>

<p>Remember what the Christians (Catholics) did in Spain? You should. There is a whole Monty Python skit about it.</p>

<p>So before you say &quot;Oh hell! The Muzzies are jelly!!!!1one&quot; you should research beyond the point of finding one piece that agrees with your stance.</p>

<p>No, I made my point very clearly and you&#39;re  trying to make a silly semantic argument because you have no substantive rebuttal. Germans were fools to persecute the Jews, which is why they&#39;re now trying to get them to move back to Germany.

<p>You lose again! Israel builds world class R&amp;D facilities <strong>because</strong> we protect them and give them money. The simple truth of the matter is if it weren&#39;t for the US and the UK Israel would have never survived the desert climate.</p>

<p>You can defend Israel until you are blue in the face, but the fact is that many people in the US and Europe are getting real tired of supporting them financially and militarily. Eventually, we will turn our back on her and she <strong>will</strong> die. And what <em>is</em> sad about it is their citizens that are largely innocent in all of this will bear the brunt of any military action against Israel because of her administrators horrific deeds. Sorry if you don&#39;t like to hear that, but them&#39;s the brakes, brotha.</p>

<p>I love the fact you are using circular reasoning on this, but, the fact remains; Israel would never be able to do that without our help and money from our taxpayers.</p>

<p>This really is going to be my last reply to you on this issue. You have it set in your mind one way, me, another way. I believe your argument is invalid.
