        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every couple months on one of my days off, I some how end up spending a few hours online watching conspiracy videos.  Videos like the Zeitgeist films, 911 stuff, Federal Reserve shit and the like.  I watch them and I get pissed.  As I am watching them I start to think about ways that I can get involved.  And before you know it, the day is almost over and I have to go back to work the next day.  Back to paying bills, buying groceries, and just trying to survive.  I know the world is fucked up, I know the government is corrupt, I know that America is a police state, I know the Federal Reserve runs the world, I know that the human race is destroying the planet and spreading like a cancer.  But what I don&#39;t know is what I am supposed to do about it.  No one has any real answer on what to do.  They only want to tell you the problem, not how to fix it.  Am I the only one that feels like this?</p>

<p>TL;DR
How can I save the world from itself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nott anti-Semitic.  Anti-Zionist.  Zionism has, unfortunately, done a lot to make sure and very much confuse the two so that it&#39;s difficult for many to tell the difference between one and the other and many who are really rightfully hating against Zionism lump Judaism along with it since Judaism is, again, so heavily tied with it (almost identical with it on the surface), and many Zionists ARE indeed Jews.  That&#39;s obviously part of the plan:  Confuse Zionism and Judaism so that Zionism can hide behind the other.  They are indeed different, however, and many Jews (some in Israel itself) directly oppose Zionism.</p>

<p>Down with Zionism and anyone who supports it - whether Jew or non-Jew.  Doesn&#39;t matter.  It&#39;s Zionism that&#39;s the cancer which must be eradicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be the change.  You are at a stage in your spiritual awakening where the conspiracy is overwhelming.  As you go down this rabbit hole you will discover that it all stems from a desire to oppress the human spirit - and I mean that literally.  YOU are a spirit and you chose to take up in a physical human body to be here at this particularly incredible time in human history.  Do you think it is happenchance that you were born here at this particular time or do you believe you have a purpose?  The fact is - everyone has a purpose and the controllers would have you believe that purpose is chasing their money because their money leads to emptiness and soullessness.  Discover your sovereignty and begin to FIGHT back in whatever way you are capable!  It might be all you can do is help your neighbor roll the garbage bin back to its place...if that&#39;s all you can do, do it!  If you have talents or other capabilities, start finding ways to hone them and put them to good use.  Research is great, but you need to turn that knowledge into action.  Find corruption in your local area and try to extinguish it.  Pick a subject you&#39;re passionate about or annoys you greatly and go for it.  Once you discover the hidden power within you and you trust that you have a divine purpose - you will find great joy in going about your days influencing all you come in contact with.  After I discovered that fear was an illusion and I was here as a lightworker to usher in the golden age of peace and prosperity, I have witnessed before my eyes an unfoldment of understanding that has aided me in my quest to make this world a better place.  Now is just the beginning!  You gotta understand - all those goverment officials, people with &quot;power&quot; like the pope and the president...yeah they wield power but at the end of the day they are NO DIFFERENT and no more special than you.  They are a physical body with a spirit as well and have no right to oppress you whatsoever.  The sooner you can KNOW this the sooner you can begin holding your thoughts with determination which will cause your opponents to FAIL if you are pursuing a path of light.</p>

<p>A good example I can give is fluoridation....I woke up in the last 4 years and said &quot;Hey, wait a minute, my city adds fluoride to the water and I don&#39;t like it.&quot;  So I simply went to city council and told them so.  They brushed me off which presented my ego with a choice - go back to sleep or continue fighting?  Since that time I have created <a href="http://www.durhamagainstfluoride.com">http://www.durhamagainstfluoride.com</a> and will be featured in a November investigative report on Fluoride at the local ABC news affiliate.  What&#39;s stopping you from doing the same?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Getting taking back control of our wealth is the first step. Gold/diamonds/etc are good, but too impractical for most people to use on the day to day. Once the bitcoin infrastructure is more firmly in place, a snowball effect will occur once people see all the benefits their bitcoin using friends have. No paypal fees, no bank fees, no federal reserve hyperinflation. Hell, if you&#39;re just looking to make a few bucks, now&#39;s the time to invest. My bitcoins have literally increased in &quot;value&quot; by 2000 federal reserve notes since March 2012.</p>

<p>Converting your federal reserve notes to bitcoin is really the only way I can think of (outside of &quot;scary&quot; violent rebellion) to fight back. If you have a better idea, post it instead of leaving a dismissive comment. If you don&#39;t have a better idea, shut the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Math indeed is the owner of bitcoin, it is a decentralized currency. If you want to get nitpicky, every bitcoin user technically &quot;owns&quot; it, because the computational power needed to &quot;mint&quot; bitcoins as well as log transactions is distributed across the all the bitcoin users&#39; computers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with fiat currency isn&#39;t that the paper it&#39;s printed on doesn&#39;t have intrinsic value, it&#39;s that the effort required to create fiat currency doesn&#39;t reflect the currency&#39;s value. Bitcoin, like gold, can&#39;t be created at the same rate as fiat currency and so threats like hyperinflation go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot. This is going down because it&#39;s deliberate. 
What you can do: relocate if possible. Get out of major population centers. Set by some food. Heck - go buy an above ground pool and fill it with water. Lots of little things you can do to make yourself a LITTLE less vulnerable. Have a gun? Go practice. Only have a bow and arrow? Go practice. Get REALLY good. Find decent people in your area that are like-minded if you can.
Need to stay healthy in times of collapse (for whatever reason)? Stock up on vitamins now. Learn how to use chlorine dioxide and hypochlorous acid. Go to the feed store and buy a bunch of FishMox - it&#39;s the same penicillin prescribed by doctors. While you&#39;re there grab some DMSO - great for healing wounds (even sprains and breaks) quickly. Go read &quot;Doom and Bloom&quot; and watch the videos. Learn how to stitch up a wound.</p>

<p>In other words - prepare yourself. Dunno if anyone here is aware of this, but you will actually find a lot of people paying attention to what is happening in churches all over the country, especially non-denominational (not Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopalian...just less likely there is all). This is on account of these events all existing in bible prophecy. You can always look there for others like you who are paying attention.</p>

<p>TL;DR How can I save the world from itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Start with yourself, then pay it forward.</p>

<p>Try to educate (not violently cram information down people&#39;s throats) people about what&#39;s going on in the world around them, and try to make them interested enough that they&#39;ll do the same. If you can educate a few people and make them interested enough, and those 3 people do the same, etc, then that&#39;s a great start. Start with yourself, then start locally and within your community. Educate people on what to do in case of emergency/catastrophe, the benefits of buying locally, of learning trade skills, and try the best you can to spread the word. In a humbling sense, you&#39;re only one man, don&#39;t think you can do the work of 10,000 men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most you can do is tell everyone like you are doing. Try telling them about chemtrails BC that is something they can witness and observe with their own eyes and know for themselves if it is true or not. Though I do admit most people will just not care or still think it&#39;s a joke even when you point them out to them. I was with a friend one day and the trails were so bad you could see the grid/pattern they were making over the are. I pointed it out to my friend and he just gave me a sarcastic, &quot;OH NO DUDE THE GOV IS AFTER US!&#39;&#39; type response. Not surprisingly that was one of my friends who only watches TV and browses reddit in his spare time. TV is our biggest problem. I mean you can kinda tell when all someone does is watch TV just by speaking to them for a few moments. </p>

<p>Anyways, I have always wanted to make a huge banner with a list of stuff like chemtrails, the fed reserve, GMOs,etc. Just make a small statement about each that shows it&#39;s damages/dangers/how it will be used for control and hang it across an intersection. I also have always wanted to create a small flyer with the same deal and just start hanging them up or giving them to police departments/fire/etc. </p>

<p>And yeah, your flyer idea sounds great. I might actually do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel ya, OP, but you can&#39;t change it IMO. There are too many people to coordinate things with. It&#39;s like tying 20-30 people together and telling them &quot;Walk forward...&quot; but what is forward? My forward could be your stumble to the left. Sure, you can make a reference point on a wall and tell people to walk toward it, but that&#39;s only a handful of people. How do you get the majority of the world to work together? I don&#39;t think you can. </p>

<p>So what to do, OP? </p>

<p>Practice due diligence in every situation and pay attention, but realize that the universe really <em>is</em> unfolding the way it is supposed to and own it.</p>

<p>Am I too pessimistic? I ask because this is what helped me when I was in your situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, why would you take this responsability upon yourself? You&#39;re not in a position to do what you propose so don&#39;t consider it, and don&#39;t think it&#39;s up to you.</p>

<p>What you can do is this. Educate yourself, fact check things on here, develop a way to spread this among people that you know to educate them as well. Right now this is the only thing we can do. </p>

<p>Most importantly: Don&#39;t let these events lead you toward a victimhood mentialty. Feel empowered and lucky that you had the opportunity to see things for how they actually are instead of being brainwashed. Feel good about it. I felt the same way for a while but realized that I am honestly caring too much when I can&#39;t do TOO much about it, but I can make a significant difference. You have to care... but not that much. have THAT attitude, take it lightly even though it&#39;s serious. </p>

<p>TLDR: Fix it by educating yourself further and educating others. Don&#39;t sweat it too much, feel empowered that you can make a difference and can see what is happening.</p>

My occupation is that I own am insurance agency which is of course tied to our financial system that will collapse sooner than later. When it does I have no income. I have no degree and no other skills. I&#39;m as well prepared as it gets with survival items but my big issue is finding a place to ride it out. Im in a city that will get real rough when it hits the fan. Moreover I would like to be proactive and fight this thing to keep it from coming but all I do is work to keep a roof over my families head. I have a hard time not being depressed off and on all day if I let myself think about it too much. For those of us with kids, trying to fight this for the time being is one we can&#39;t afford. One way or another we will be forced to eventually but I just can&#39;t fathom giving up my house, my job, and more and starting all over in a time like now. I would like to know what someone in my position could even do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alone, people are fairly weak. But, in a group and organized, people become stronger. So, I guess we need to talk to each other about this situation. It would be better to do it in person, but through the computer will work too. </p>

<p>A lot of things that people do are out of our control. We can only control our own lives. And even this is fairly limited. We are born and live in a society and a culture. These things change only slowly over time. Slavery has been outlawed, but Jim Crow is alive and well. It will take hundreds of years for it to stop to exist.</p>

<p>I think the best way out is too become as self-sufficient as you can and then drop out of society as much as possible. You still have to pay taxes, but the big boys use off-shore tax shelters for a reason. You should too. I do not recommend doing anything to show up on their radar. You, alone, are probably too weak to fight the power of the state. </p>

<p>I think we should try to continue to educate ourselves and those around us. It may help us prepare for the future.</p>
