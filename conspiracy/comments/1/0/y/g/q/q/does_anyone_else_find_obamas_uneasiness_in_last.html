The &quot;two&quot; party system needs to be propped up by both sides being near even, 8 years of bush, down to the wire, eight years of Obama, down to the wire. Make it seem (and it is) like a constant struggle between the two parties, neck and neck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they want to make it seem closer to get more people behind the two main parties (to keep people from voting 3rd party). Before it seemed to me like Obama pretty much had it. If they make the race closer between them two, then you&#39;ll have more people saying &quot;well I hafta vote for Obama now so Romney won&#39;t win&quot; (or the reverse if you&#39;re in a red state). Think about it, if Romney lost the debate it may have been the nail in the coffin. They needed to bring him back up to keep the false left-right paradigm balanced enough to keep people interested (in one of the two main candidates). If everybody thought Romney had no chance, they&#39;d probably have the courage to vote third party. They get Romney back in the game and now you have a lot more people voting for Obama not because they like him, but because they&#39;re scared shitless of Romney.</p>

<p>It was obvious that RMoney was wired to the gills yesterday; probably on Adderall. Rude, pushy, interrupting...all the signs of amphetamines.</p>

<p>Obama just did a SHIT job. He could have hammered RMoney on SO many things...yeah, he held the high road but RMoney totally outclassed him.</p>

<p>Remember people, RMoney was given HUNDREDS of millions of dollars by Israeli donors in exchange for a war...so he&#39;s gonna try his damndest to win this or Uncle Binyamin and Uncle Adelson (the Godfathers) may break his skinny Mormon legs! :-)</p>
