        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post is in all the requests to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/10yh3i/the_mother_of_all_conspiracies/c6hrc3w?context=3">this post</a>. I am going to try to explain a certain idea, namely, “the rabbit hole” and show just how deep it can go.</p>

<p>As soon as you realize that the world isn&#39;t quite as it seems, you begin your journey into unknown. While searching for answers you come across lies telling you to go back, assuring that there&#39;s nothing to it or half-truths leading you to dead ends. And just when you think you have it all figured out, something new comes along that changes everything. This is known as the rabbit hole. If there&#39;s a lesson to it, then it teaches you to question everything and not to take anything for granted. Therefore I am not asking you to accept my thoughts as truth and without questioning, but to consider the ideas presented and use them to your own likings. If you think it&#39;s crazy, I am fine with that because I know it&#39;s crazy. Think of this as a thought experiment where we are going to discuss interesting possibilities simply for the fun of it. </p>

<p>My own journey began long ago when I was met with a hard choice whether I should take hard road or the easy one: the path of honesty and righteousness or to live by my own rules. By experience I knew that the world supported lies, deceit and selfishness while constantly beating down those who were out to do good deeds. But then, something peculiar happened: I asked myself “why?”. And so began my descent into the rabbit hole. That was over 15 years ago. </p>

<p>Funny how long after, I realized that the search of truth is, in fact, the hard road. I noticed that there were a lot of strange things about the society and that it kept pushing people down into ignorance, lies and suffering. I held strong and simply continued my search for truth, trying to understand the reasons why we are in this situations so that I could do something about it. I end up studying every scientific field, leaving nothing without consideration and scrutinous study. One interesting thing I discovered was that most scientific fields have a grand important question to which no answer is provided. Here are the big questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biology: Where did life come from?<br/></li>
<li>Chemistry: How did the basic molecules of life form?<br/></li>
<li>Psychology: What is society, intelligence, memory and human mind?<br/></li>
<li>Neurology: What is consciousness?<br/></li>
<li>Astronomy: How did the Universe begin? Is there life out there?<br/></li>
<li>Physics: What is the smallest particle and how did it come to be? What is time? What is the fourth and fifth dimension?<br/></li>
<li>Mathematics: What is zero, what is infinity and is there any significance in mathematical constants?<br/></li>
<li>Philosophy: Why are we here and does god exist?<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>If you really think about it, you can notice vaguely that all of these big questions are somehow related. I began to search for these connections and try to find as many pieces of the puzzle as possible. All of these questions have strange consequences: If we find even one answer, it is very likely that many of the others questions will collapse as well. However, there is one contradictory exception: alien life.</p>

<p>Surely finding alien life wouldn&#39;t affect our understanding of what is consciousness, where did life come from, how did the universe begin and why are we here? Or would it? Furthermore we can ask why haven&#39;t we discovered alien life? If we look into the matter further, we notice that things make no sense; From the scientific point of view we shouldn&#39;t be here and our existence is beyond all probabilities, for all time in existence is not enough to put together the building blocks of life in the exact sequence to create life. On the other hand, accidental formation of life would imply that the Universe was, in fact, designed so that life would form in it. If life indeed is formed because structure of the Universe encourages it to, then is birth of intelligence also an aspect of this phenomena and why we don&#39;t we see alien life all over the place? Once again we arrive to the grand questions of science and their relations to one another.</p>

<p>I learned that best tools for discovering the unknown were not to be found in any books, but had to be developed independently. So I began thinking of abstract contexts and naming things that had no name. This method produced amazing results which I could not foresee, creating to my disposal completely new tools of reasoning. I&#39;ll try to explain this as simply as possibly, but this part might get very philosophical and technical. I began tackling the problem from a completely new angle and tried to understand what is consciousness. From a metaphysical point of view I realized that our existence here is an important variable on solving what is consciousness. I began by specifying what is &#39;nothingness&#39; and &#39;somethingness&#39; and what differences there are between these two. I also took consciousness into consideration and got interesting results. Consciousness exists and yet we can&#39;t physically measure it. Even more interesting is that consciousness, or the mind, can form new things by rearranging old ones and seemingly even creating new ideas out of &#39;nothigness&#39;, which in non-physical terms is same as pulling things into existence out of nowhere. This means that we have the potential of the gods: we can create something from nothing. If indeed we have the power of the gods, then how come we can&#39;t rearrange molecules with our minds? Answer to this question is the final piece in the puzzle, the critical point that makes all of the grand questions collapse. Before I provide the answer, let&#39;s go back a little. I want you to read an allegory (I didn&#39;t even realize that it was very similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">Plato&#39;s cave</a> until I had already written the whole thing) that I wrote before all this and decided not to post for it coming out sounding crazy:</p>

<p><em>“I want to believe that life is precious and that the minds it holds is a special thing. I want to believe that there is a whole another unseen aspect to everything - that everything we see around us is only a small fraction of things. I want to believe that mind, as we know it, is much more than just a complex clockwork ticking onward, predetermined to make ticks and tocks, to make choices and decisions presented to us. I want to believe that each one of us holds the potential to create and to co-create, together, but that for some reason we are isolated from one another and everything else. That somehow we are limited to interact with the Universe and other minds only via certain rules and ideas that chain our existence to suffering and struggle. It&#39;s really as if we are in a prison and that no one of us can remember a thing before we came here or even verify if anything exists outside our cold prison cells. It&#39;s like the world is fake and the only real thing is our voices trying to reach one another from behind the walls that separate us. Imagine that we are all receding in dark chambers with all our memories erased. At first we understand nothing what is going on, but slowly we began to feel floor, understand the voices and remember where the walls are. Our company is the most important thing in here and so we cling to one another. However, once in a while our precious friends and cellmates are unexpectedly taken away and no one of us can tell whether we will ever hear from them again. Whether they get free, go into a more horrible place or end up back here with their memories erased, we do not know. It&#39;s no wonder that some of us go mad and end up shouting evil things to those around them. Here the words feel like real fists, leaving those addressed traumatized. Some few of us wander around their chambers back and forth, studying the grooves on the walls and searching for new ways to loose a brick, while others study how to build  clever devices or to carve other things from rocks. Me, I listen. I listen to the cell-wanderers as well as to the rumors going around. Sometimes when I listen carefully I can hear other things echoing from beyond the corridors and from behind the walls. I try to imagine the world beyond and learn from it. I can imagine myself out there walking in the light instead of lying here in the darkness, bound by these shackles. But it&#39;s not me I&#39;m really worried about: it&#39;s the rest of you who cannot hear any of this. I want you all to stop for a while and listen.”</em></p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s get back to the question of why seemingly we can&#39;t reorganize matter with our minds (Also look up <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc">double slit experiment</a> ). To know why our minds cannot do, we need to know what our minds can do. Our consciousness affects other consciousnesses, for simple ideas can have a lot of influence on other people and presence itself has an effect. Our consciousness also effects on other things: our brain, which consequently affect the body. This means that our consciousness, in fact, CAN affect the physical matter! How, I do not know exactly. As I said before, consciousness affects other consciousness, which could mean that the physical world as we know could and be viewed as another mind far too complex for us to understand and to affect in any significant way. Surprisingly enough, this is the same conclusion that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a>, the inventor of calculator, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#The_monads">decided upon</a>. Explaining in these terms why we can&#39;t move things with the power of our mind means that our consciousness is too weak and limited to affect anything beyond certain changes inside the human brain. But could there be beings out there whose consciousnesses are strong enough to actually affect the physical world? Such beings would have the power not only to manipulate matter, but to manipulate our weak consciousnesses a thousand times more efficiently. Such beings would also very likely know most answers to the &#39;grand questions&#39;. They would know that all life comes from what some scientists refer as “The Mind of God” and that every single particle is a part of that. They would know that consciousness is both an individual things and the sum of all. These beings could even hold the power to create new life. That brings me, as promised, to a thing I call The Hierarchy of Species.</p>

<p>The Hierarchy of Species is concept that stronger consciousness dominates over the weaker one. Consciousnesses that are approximately equal hold no significant advantages over one another. We, humans, are just a little bit above other animals, noticeably above insects and superior to simple organisms. We have the power to control our brains and via it we can control our body that somehow manages to controls the cells inside us. The cells hold certain power over molecules that hold certain power over atoms. It&#39;s a hierarchical system that goes not only down but up as well. We, the mankind, form a single organism which forms an even higher consciousness. However, our minds are too selfish to form a single unified being: we disagree on too many things and have problems of learning to work together. This is partly because we deem ourselves as the pinnacle of all creation and generally do not know the answers to the grand questions. This makes us vulnerable not only to ourselves but also to the influence and dominance of other consciousnesses that are not so far above us. We are here weak and vulnerable so that others could take advantage of us so that we could learn to stand up to ourselves and to evolve stronger. The process may not be immediate but rather slow one. I can say this here because we are evolving and because we have developed the technology where I can express these thoughts to all of you regardless where you live. This is a result of learning to understand the Mind Of God and developing an ability to manipulate it indirectly just enough to build this technology. However, we need to evolve not only technologically but consciously as well. This may sound blatant like all the commercial go-green -crap trying to sell you junk, but the best way to start is from yourself: get rid of all the addictions, learn self-control, educate yourself and always, no matter what, search for the truth.</p>

<p>No, it has nothing to do with religion. It&#39;s a term made famous by Stephen Hawking and I think it represents the idea of mind-Universe very well. The logical methaphysical conculsion is that physical world as we know can be viewed or perhaps even is in a literal sense a mind far too complex for us to understand and too advanced to directly interfere with any of our business. The the laws of gravity or matter itself, for example, could be viewed as a small elements of this mind. You wouldn&#39;t care to study what certain cells of your body want so why would the Universe care what any individual person wants? For all we know, the Mind of God is far too advanced to even &#39;think&#39; in any traditional sense, for there may be nothing for it to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used Stephen Hawking as a reference because I like his reasoning very much and because some of his ideas hold inspiration to me. As do works of many other physicists. I didn&#39;t start by taking anything for granted, but by building my knowledge from scratch and by verifying as much as possible for myself. I prefer everyone else do the same as I specifically pointed out in the original post. I&#39;ll respect others regardless of what conclusions they make and perhaps even might improve my own understanding and reasoning from those who point out my mistakes, propose better ways of thinking or are inspiring to me in any other ways. I do not encourage self-deceit, not theological nor pseudo-factual. Perhaps the one problem is the lack vocabulary and misconception on the word “god” by which I do not mean anything worth worship, but &#39;consciousness&#39; at any time and in any form. Other consciousnesses or a single consciousness is therefore not something that should be complied but something that exists outside of you and can be used as a tool in improving your own consciousness depending whether you want to. You may very well deny all of these notions in which case you still have one mind you recognize – your own. You may call the Universe lifeless matter and you&#39;d be correct or then you may think of it as a mind of god and there you would be correct as well. Do whatever suits you best.</p>

<p>Your post was exceptional. Thank you, sir.  I have been thinking about very similar things and the above quote I pulled has been the exact conclusion I have rested on. </p>

<p>As an addition, I would like to comment on your statement &quot;search for the truth&quot;. There is no one truth. This is a tenet of post modernism. So what then? I think the answer lies in find what is true to you. This takes an enormous time of introspection and detachment from stimulations

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for reading. Yes, there is no absolute truth, only the inner truth. If there exists nothing else but consciousness, then even the laws of nature are thoughts, always changing, developing and flowing.

<p>On your journey, did most knowledge come from self-realizations in meditation/thinking by posing questions to yourself and/or has there been some fantastic material you&#39;ve read that really &quot;evolved&quot; your thought process?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take inspiration from everywhere around me, especially from nature. I try to keep an open mind and not to take anything for granted. Just keep on questioning your inner values and if you can&#39;t figure something out for yourself, try to see if answer can be found from nature. A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell is in my opinion a very intense mind-opening book not only to those who are new to everything but also to those who already have a very good understanding of philosophy and origins of Scientific reasoning. I myself like to link sciences and ideas together and create new things out of already existing knowledge. Also very good read is pretty much anything written by physicists. &#39;Surely You&#39;re joking, Mr. Feynman!&#39; by Richard Feynman is a very good and entertaining book showing how independent thinking is important and how following your own heart brings happiness to you and to those around you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love this! Well written and easy to understand.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been interested in the mind for a long time. I&#39;ve thought about consciousness a lot. Does it even exists? If so, why does it exist?... I&#39;ve also been interested in A.I., and always wondered if A.I. would eventually become conscious.  </p>

<p>I believe I&#39;m making progress in figuring this all out.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I think so far:  </p>

<p>Our Sub-Conscious (the part we don&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;control&quot;) does all of the decision making for us. We are merely input/output machines. We THINK we have control over what we do.  Some people think that consciousness is there to &quot;cancel&quot; certain decisions made by our sub-conscious. Experiments have been done on freewill where fMRI+Software was able to predict which button someone was going to press (even before the person was consciously aware he was going to choose that button).  I believe our consciousness is some sort of complicated illusion that&#39;s necessary for human motivation (mostly to reproduce and stay alive).  Everything EXCEPT the person&#39;s mind are responsible for that person&#39;s actions. So the sayings: &quot;Our mind is our body&quot; and &quot;We are what we eat&quot; are more true than we&#39;d like to think.  </p>

<p>The science channel had a great show called &quot;Secret Brain&quot;. They demonstrated that we&#39;re pretty much only driven by our sub-conscious.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  </p>

<p>Around the time of Sigmund Freud, there was a lesser known psychoanalyst named Wilhelm Reich. He focused more on the body to change the mind.  If I were a propaganda machine, I wouldn&#39;t want the public to know that a mind&#39;s decision making abilities can be directly influenced by it&#39;s surroundings.  His arrest by the FBI is interesting: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich#Arrested_by_the_FBI">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich#Arrested_by_the_FBI</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spared commenting to your reply for last before going to sleep, because I really appreciate your remarks regarding the A.I. When studying consciousness, the artificial intelligence is the number one method at our disposal. A.I. is of great interest to me and this subject is something I have been speculating about for a long time. I think that regardless of how many terabytes of code a machine has and no matter how complex its algorithms are – it will be a mere tool as long as it cannot make mistakes. You see, consciousness is the ability to serve yourself and one that cannot make mistakes cannot serve anything but the mathematical rules. As soon as you add the possibility of a mistake, then all of a sudden you have no control and the decision process could very well be up to machine itself executing its own errors and that way decisions. Think if someone would have absolute control over your mind, how could you make decisions for yourself? There is this concept I call “the chaos code” which is basically a computer program constantly changing and simulating certain strings of code with the potential of coming together by chance and forming different types of A.I.s and indeterminately unknown amount of errors in its code. A stable , imperfect and yes changing code could actually be called alive and conscious. From where that consciousness would come from, I do not know, accept that it has something to do with “chaos”.</p>

<p>About the whole sub-consciousness thing: as you too noticed, we have in fact very little control over our bodies, brains and sub-consciousnesses. Hypnosis, for example, is possible only when a subject willingly gives its will into the hands of a hypnotist. In the same way people succumb to their basic instincts and people trying to control them. The very little control that we have over ourselves, we call consciousness. Intelligent people often hold a bit more control over their brains and can often override some of the basic instincts and instead rely more on reasoning. Does this mean intelligent people are more conscious? If so then independence from the world results as a stronger consciousness. </p>

<p>Consider for a moment that the Universe does not have a beginning; that it is the only perpetual-being, this answers most of your questions.</p>

<p>How did the basic molecules of life form?--In the Star that &quot;died&quot; and is now a black dwarf; the Earth.</p>

<p>What is society, intelligence, memory and human mind?--This is a common point throughout your piece; the divisions between these things are arbitrary definitions/illusions that keep the &quot;sense of self&quot; intact.</p>

<p>What is consciousness?—You’re right this is a squishy-one! I go with the synonym “understanding”; I propose &quot;stupid&quot; is the activity of repeating any thought. Even repeating an effective recipe is now &quot;stupid&quot; because it is a retrieval system; &quot;rolling tape&quot;. &quot;You&#39;re not thinking---that was stupid!&quot; So, many of us go through the motions and are <em>not conscious</em>!</p>

<p>How did the Universe begin?—No.  Is there life out there?—You already know the answer to this one, check r/ufo for discussion on the “why”!</p>

<p>What is the smallest particle and how did it come to be? –I don’t know. What is time?-- Time is motion, without motion (movie), all that would be is a static picture.  What is the fourth and fifth dimension?—Dimensions do not explain as well as ‘connections’ IMO.</p>

<p>Mathematics: What is zero, what is infinity and is there any significance in mathematical constants?—I go with: “Nothing does not exist, anywhere; there is nowhere where ‘nothing’ exists”, and “Math is a shadow (Pi is an unnatural relationship), the Universe is not made of math, BUT the virtual-universe now being created by humans is Math and the beings who will live there…”</p>

<p>Why are we here and does god exist?—Everybody here has an idea they like about this!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I totally want that pop-up book.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s WHERE all these molecules were formed, not HOW they formed life. Just recently I read an article that they were able to figure out the circumstances in which molecules form the basic building blocks of life, but are still far away from figuring out how to create new life in a tube.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did the Universe begin?—No. Is there life out there?—You already know the answer to this one, check r/ufo for discussion on the “why”!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I know: a bunch of nothing exploded and then formed everything while expanding like a balloon into all directions at once. I have been lurking on r/ufo but they&#39;re all crazy...NOT!...or some of them are...or at least the ones that claim hot air balloons as UFOs masked as hot air balloons. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting thought. I personally think intelligence is highly based on chaos rather than pure logic. That&#39;s why we are alive and why we make mistakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the stimulating post. </p>

<p>The &quot;how&quot; questions relax somewhat when considering the Universe has been morphing things far longer than currently estimated by the crowd (BB) who is trying to steal the &quot;creation-territory&quot; held by the religious-myths.</p>

<p>Also, true annihilation is actually the perplexing thought; how can &quot;nothing&quot; ever exist (where do ideas lay?). As unnerving as it was for me, I currently settle with &quot;{Nothing} is impossible, now and forever&quot;, so the One Everything is inevitable and (gulp), Infinite (there is nowhere where there is nothing).</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t know anything!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. It reminds me of something I was thinking of yesterday related to consciousness. And how some of our limitation may be due to how we have been trained(manipulated) to perceive reality, and how we choose to process our sensory perceptions. </p>

<p>Once in a while I have dreams that recall something that happened earlier that day, or even the day before that make me go WOAH, what a fucking epiphany why didn&#39;t I perceive it that way in the moment...that would have been so useful. </p>

<p>Maybe we can retrain ourselves to use our minds in a more effective manner so that we can get that WOAH factor all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is one interesting thing I am working on. I am very interested in human intelligence and inner workings of the mind. I realized that memory and visualization are very important factors in performing difficult intellectual tasks. Normally, people don&#39;t use those part of their brain, but under certain circumstances the brain adjusts itself and activates new parts if needed. Blind people, for example, tend to have much better memory than average people because they rely on their memory in their everyday life. In short, I have been developing mind-techniques which are meant to activate certain parts of the brain that we normally don&#39;t use. Before I even noticed, I was sitting on the floor with my eyes closed and trying to visualize complex geometrical shapes floating before me. It really struck me when I realized that this is what mediation is all about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I see it, that&#39;s one of the dead ends and a very easy one to fall for. As soon as you recognize that you have no free will: you lose the will to free will. It&#39;s like standing on the road and not moving out of the cars way because you are convinced that there is nothing you can do to avoid the impact just because you think you are destined to get hit and while all you really need to do is to take a step. If there was no free will at all then there would be no mind and no &#39;something&#39; in the &#39;nothing&#39;. In fact, there would be no &#39;nothing&#39; because the concept itself depends on the existence of &#39;something&#39;.

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry man but that&#39;s not true. Science has well documented how life arose on this planet. Many creationists don&#39;t understand (I&#39;m not saying you are, I&#39;m just saying life is probably more common than a lot of people think) is almost a mathematical certainty in the universe. The universe is so large that we cannot even begin to wrap our heads around it. The number of galaxies in the universe are more than the grains of sand on all the beaches in the world. Imagine the number of planets within those galaxies. It&#39;s mind bogglingly large. So there is a very high probability that throughout the many billions of years the universe has been in existent there is a planet out there that is just right to support life and does not get destroyed by some sun blowing up and whatnot. Actually, we know of a place where that has happened! Earth. </p>

<p>Many scientists suspect that there may be/may have been life just in our solar system. Imagine how much life that is probably out there in the universe. Some may even be more complex than the human being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite unusual to get replies to a 4 months old thread. Sorry it took me so long to reply: I haven&#39;t been active on r/conspiracy in a while. What I meant by the probability of life coming into existence was the formation of proper primordial soup and all the right nucleotides organizing themselves into right places by pure mathematical chance into a functioning (first) organism capable of reproduction and surviving. The probabilities of nucleatides coming together to form the most simple cell alone are beyond astronomical. However, this isn&#39;t really a valid argument since the first organism may have been something completely beyond our imagination and current scientific understanding. What you described is the Clockwork Universe Theory. If we assume that the our Universe is formed in a way that allows life to come into being (and in many ways this IS the case), then our Universe should be full of life. And yet, we haven&#39;t been able to detect any. As far as practical evidences go: we could still be a freak accident and all alone in the entire Universe/dimension.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting read, i have thought about something similar before.
If there were a God, why would he/she/(nonassignable sexuality) place us in this realm. Then I thought that if God is the ocean, then maybe we are like a drop of water of God.And one drop is capable of sending a ripple through the whole body of water. Just like all energy moves in waves.</p>

<p>Perhaps our world is some sort of filter or experiment and when we die we do rejoin the original source/God, improving Him with our experiences.</p>

<p>One of the hardest temptations to overcome is temptation of the flesh since we are trapped in flesh in our existence.</p>

<p>Hallucinogens can show you how much more is going on that your brain doesn&#39;t perceive. It filters a lot out to prevent overstimulation allowing us to focus attention on specific things. I&#39;m not suggesting you do acid or mushrooms or any other drugs but they alter perception and change people&#39;s view of reality.</p>

<p>The &quot;rabbit hole&quot; is something very personal, like every esoteric secret, it must be discovered.</p>

<p>My personal &quot;rabbit hole&quot; was when I discovered that everything is an illusion; desires, religion, pain, pleasure, its all an illusion. </p>

<p>Buddhism, Gnosticism, Early Christianity, Plato, Descartes,  all of them cover the same central subject, the imperfectness of our perceived &quot;universe&quot;, an illusion created to deceive.</p>

<p>About our innate &quot;powers&quot; there is this one short story by Jorge Luis Borges, &quot;The Writing of the God&quot; a wizard seeking revenge against the king that locked him up, unlocks the 100th name of God on the stripes of a jaguar, becoming one with Him, omnipotent, and this is when he realizes, &quot;why revenge if he can have and do anything ?&quot;, and so quietly awaits for his death to come naturally. Castaneda also revolves around this subject when he discusses &quot;power&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is great and vastly interesting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This makes us vulnerable not only to ourselves but also to the influence and dominance of other consciousnesses that are not so far above us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like a lion running down a calf or something? This may be shallow but if we were to be preyed upon in any way by a &#39;higher&#39; species, it won&#39;t necessarily be some kind of opportunity to grow stronger. Animals(including humans) prey relentlessly on each other for selfish gain all the time but the lower species don&#39;t have a choice I guess, if anything really does. I don&#39;t think we have nearly as much control as we think we do and even if we did, that amount of control is so vastly insignificant it&#39;s mind-boggling. As chaotic as all this bullshit seems it&#39;s amazing to me that there is such a balance and it&#39;s a god damned shame that it&#39;s being wasted to such an extreme. </p>

<p>I really just don&#39;t think anything actually matters. Anything you do and anything that happens, you can just look up into the sky and easily see that it&#39;s of no significance which seems as much a blessing as a curse. For me, things seems to be a constant fight like my brain is trying to split in half and it&#39;s been going on for years with a few violent explosions along with one I&#39;d consider nuclear.</p>

<p>I&#39;d better end this. Thanks for the post and excuse me if this is all seems stupid, vague, and naive. I&#39;m dealing with a lot of pain and struggle and I have no one to talk to about it so it&#39;s nice to express it somehow. One way I do it is by writing technical death metal =P</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very good point. Death and misery may not be such bad things as we believe them to be, for without sadness we wouldn&#39;t have happiness and without misery we wouldn&#39;t care to develop science, new ideas nor ourselves. Life renews itself, changes and comes out stronger. That&#39;s how we, the mankind, came to be. As you pointed out when it comes to our place in the nature, we are different from other animals because we have just enough free will to affect some of these processes. That gives us understanding that no animals have and we end up worrying about future and concepts which simpler organisms have no understanding of. In a way all life has free will, but only intelligent life can realize it and has the ability to increase the amount of own free will. I have pointed out how that works <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/10zwf4/journey_into_the_rabbit_hole/c6i9ijy">here</a>. </p>

<p>For us humans, the lack of free will brings about pain and misery, but increased free will has the opposite effect. The more a person depends on drugs, impulsive subconscious behavior, admiration from other people, fear of rejection, fear of death and all external things outside own mind, the less free will that person has. Surprisingly enough, the mind affects the body: a person with a very strong will can cure many of the physical and at least some mental problems by believing he can get better. Theoretically there&#39;s nothing our free will cannot do, but since we don&#39;t really know how to actualize it, we end up obeying external forces that are beyond our control. This self-healing has been scientifically proven and has been monitored for example in old people who often postpone their deaths to after family holidays and celebrations by simply not wanting to die before or during such precious moments. I am not saying to abandon modern medicine, which works quite well and is all good, but that on top of that strong will can produce amazing results.</p>

<p>We hold the keys to our own happiness but standing up and opening the door is the hard part. Also, do whatever your inner gut tells you to and don&#39;t let anyone else tell you what you can and can&#39;t do. Although if it&#39;s a friendly advice, then you might want to consider it before throwing it out the window. Be the master of your own free will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, here we go.</p>

<p>The first two paragraphs are completely meaningless so we&#39;ll just skip right over that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I end up studying every scientific field, leaving nothing without consideration and scrutinous study.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sincerely doubt this is true: I mean <em>every</em> field of science?  Regardless even you <em>did</em> do this it would make you a &#39;jack of all trades but master of none&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One interesting thing I discovered was that most scientific fields have a grand important question to which no answer is provided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite.  There is the idea of a &#39;grand unifying theory&#39; however, but no-one sincerely thinks we&#39;ll figure it out, least of all scientists.</p>

<p>You&#39;re proceeding list of questions are actually philosophical questions, not scientific ones.  Science can only and does only give explanations for the relationship between two natural phenomena, nothing else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore we can ask why haven&#39;t we discovered alien life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live light years from every other galaxy and we are <em>extremely</em> limited in terms of space exploration - we&#39;ve yet to send anything out of our own solar system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the scientific point of view we shouldn&#39;t be here and our existence is beyond all probabilities,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolute nonsense.  When working out probabilities you need more than one &#39;data set&#39; which we don&#39;t have (there is only this universe that we know of).  The universe exists, its &#39;probability&#39; of it existing is &#39;1&#39;.  Same for our existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for all time in existence is not enough to put together the building blocks of life in the exact sequence to create life. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to substantiate this with something, there is no credible reason to believe this statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I began by specifying what is &#39;nothingness&#39; and &#39;somethingness&#39; and what differences there are between these two. I also took consciousness into consideration and got interesting results. Consciousness exists and yet we can&#39;t physically measure it. Even more interesting is that consciousness, or the mind, can form new things by rearranging old ones and seemingly even creating new ideas out of &#39;nothigness&#39;, which in non-physical terms is same as pulling things into existence out of nowhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t really define any of the terms you&#39;re liberally using and really all you&#39;re saying here is that humans (largely thanks to &#39;oversized&#39; frontal lobes) are capable of conceiving new ideas.  I wouldn&#39;t exactly call this &#39;something from nothing&#39; in the philosophical nor scientific sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If indeed we have the power of the gods, then how come we can&#39;t rearrange molecules with our minds?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we are not gods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our consciousness affects other consciousnesses,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is too vague; in what way can one consciousness affect another?  Through intelligent, rational discourse is one method but you seem to be implying that one mind can control another (think mind possession) - how did you come to such a conclusion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our consciousness also effects on other things: our brain, which consequently affect the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These three elements (as best as we can tell) are inextricably linked, you can&#39;t have one without the other two, they work essentially in tandem with each other, they&#39;re <em>not</em> independent of each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the physical world as we know could and be viewed as another mind far too complex for us to understand and to affect in any significant way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not impossible but there&#39;s no credible reason to believe this and you haven&#39;t substantiated the claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explaining in these terms why we can&#39;t move things with the power of our mind means that our consciousness is too weak and limited to affect anything beyond certain changes inside the human brain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could be wrong but didn&#39;t Liebniz propose the existence of metaphysical &#39;monads&#39; that in effect control everything in the universe?  How would our consciousness control these metaphysical beings who have their own consciousness that&#39;s presumably superior to ours?</p>

<p>Such beings would have the power not only to manipulate matter, but to manipulate our weak consciousnesses a thousand times more efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You haven&#39;t explained how this is even possible?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such beings would also very likely know most answers to the &#39;grand questions&#39;. They would know that all life comes from what some scientists refer as “The Mind of God” and that every single particle is a part of that. They would know that consciousness is both an individual things and the sum of all. These beings could even hold the power to create new life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aren&#39;t you simply giving a vague definition of a metaphysical god?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a result of learning to understand the Mind Of God and developing an ability to manipulate it indirectly just enough to build this technology. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, its more due to our grasp of epistemology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we need to evolve not only technologically but consciously as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does one &#39;evolve&#39; consciousness?</p>

<p>To be honest, this really is just unverifiable, white-noise, although I did enjoy reading at the very least.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The first two paragraphs are completely meaningless so we&#39;ll just skip right over that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I respect your critique, but I did encourage in one of those two first paragraphs not to take my word for it, but to instead play with the thought and to look into certain matters yourself if something catches your interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I end up studying every scientific field, leaving nothing without consideration and scrutinous study.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sincerely doubt this is true: I mean every field of science? Regardless even you did do this it would make you a &#39;jack of all trades but master of none&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say I had every degree in the world or that I am the master of all. I am human and I make mistakes just as anyone else. I am a small mind on the scale presented, and regardless of anything trying my best to comprehend as much as possible within the limitations of my intelligence, time and position.</p>

<p>If you really must know, my greatest emphasis lies on Physics, Mathematics and Philosophy, although I study everything I can manage to because I have always felt that everything is somehow connected and that good understanding of all (while specializing in few particular fields) is the best I can do to make myself happy and to help my fellow minds.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One interesting thing I discovered was that most scientific fields have a grand important question to which no answer is provided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite. There is the idea of a &#39;grand unifying theory&#39; however, but no-one sincerely thinks we&#39;ll figure it out, least of all scientists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you confused the Grand Unifying Theory with the Unified Field Theory, a.k.a. Theory of Everything and simply &quot;Unified Theory&quot;. You have already labeled me as crazy, so I am going to admit that I have been working on TOE. It led me here to the conclusions presented and other stuff I absolutely did no mention about.</p>

<p>In the original post I didn&#39;t go into details not because I haven&#39;t researched, but because it would have made my text too long and too hard to understand. And even if I would provide every minute detail, some wise guy would carefully search for errors (I am not error proof either) and then exclaim the whole thing as nonsense based on personal opinion or some other missing details. That&#39;s why I am indifferent about these things and why I decided not make this post until some people requested me to. Nothing of what I really wanted to express here can be deduced from the details, but it first has to be seen as a whole. </p>

<p>Most of your critique is based on settling down on obvious answers that really tell nothing of value, such as answering question &#39;why do apples fall&#39; by &#39;Apples fall because of gravity&#39;. I am not going to try and refute every single one of your arguments or try explain why gravity works the way it does, but I&#39;ll pick up the most worthy of your arguments and try to explain the best I can.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From the scientific point of view we shouldn&#39;t be here and our existence is beyond all probabilities,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolute nonsense. When working out probabilities you need more than one &#39;data set&#39; which we don&#39;t have (there is only this universe that we know of).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever tried to calculate the probability of life assuming it was all a completely random process? I have, and I encourage you to do the same. Assume that all right genes would be put into a container (let&#39;s assume that no other factors are involved, since it&#39;s supposed to happen by pure chance) and then research what is the most simple organism known to man and count the probability of all its pairs of genes accidentally coming together creating the first living organism. You could even go as far as assuming that first living organism was much simpler than most simple known organism and that there are several combinations that could have created the working living organism: you&#39;ll still end up with astronomical odds that make no sense from pure probability alone. And this is not even taking into account the probability of these genes forming at the same time in the same place at the right circumstances and eventually creating intelligent life. As I said, make your own theories and conclusions because I could very well be wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our consciousness affects other consciousnesses,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is too vague; in what way can one consciousness affect another?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we do not know what consciousness is, I cannot give any definitive answer. However, we do cling to one another and we are highly interactive and depending upon one another. We affect one another indirectly all the time, but if we could effect one another directly, we could, at least theoretically, merge into one. For all I know the only thing keeping the Universe from collapsing into itself is the barrier that doesn&#39;t allow minds to fuse into one another just like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such beings would have the power not only to manipulate matter, but to manipulate our weak consciousnesses a thousand times more efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You haven&#39;t explained how this is even possible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If everything that exists is made out of mind and minds, stronger minds dominating the weaker and weaker having very small effect on the stronger minds: then a very strong mind could affect the stronger mind just slightly. Let&#39;s assume that a very strong mind created the physical Universe around us - then a slightly weaker mind would have the ability to affect it perhaps just enough as to change the laws of nature (if it were to have desires and would want such a thing). This is very hard to understand, but imagine for a moment that every single atom that makes your body and laws that make those atoms abide are in fact thoughts of a some sort of a super being and that you yourself are a small thought inside that mind. If you were a big idea, then you could influence other big ideas, but since you are small, you cannot affect much and must abide under the stronger thoughts and ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&#39;t you simply giving a vague definition of a metaphysical god?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am trying to explain this idea I have in the best of my ability. If you call the Universe a metaphysical god, then yes, I am trying to explain some of my understanding of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does one &#39;evolve&#39; consciousness?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By becoming more independent as an individual, by finding the inner truths and by working together with other minds.</p>

<p>EDIT: also i&#39;m not condoning drug use but dmt is oh so much more than a drug, it&#39;s like pure spirit itself. it&#39;ll show you more in 10 minutes than many see in a lifetime. it truly is the red pill of our world.</p>

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be trying DMT anytime soon because my brain is in a very intricate balance and I wouldn&#39;t want it to change any equations in there.

<p>Not quite?  So, while science is searching for a TOE, there are not holy grail&#39;s within respective fields?  So, is OP right, or isn&#39;t he?
