    <div class="md"><p>Not true.  Go and read the Old Testament.  It is a ridiculously hate-ridden fantasy written by a paranoid and self-important people who celebrate retribution and horrific violence (not to mention themselves) as religion.  I always find it funny when people try to distinguish between zionism and judaism like one is despicable while the other is utterly grounded in goodness when their only difference is the belief in a national homeland for the Jews.  The central tenet of judaism is actually grounded in a racist concept; ie God having been silly and petty enough to have chosen one race of people as his own and delegating the rest to their fiefdom. If you don&#39;t see that as racist, I don&#39;t know what you will.  If I told you I was black, and that I believed blacks were superior to whites because my &quot;religion&quot; teaches me this, would that not make me a racist?  What would be the difference?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The ethnicity/race duality is also useful for justifying things. For example. a Jewish state could be regarded as a theocracy if being Jewish was strictly a religious thing. Conversely, if Israel is looked upon as apartheid because Jewish ethnic control is baked into the country&#39;s design, then it is said that being Jewish is also religious so non-ethnic Jews can be converted (which is true, but, unlike more open religions, converts require training and the approval of rabbis).</p>

<p>Well, you are wrong. As stated elsewhere here, the Torah is only applicable to other jews. When you start looking at the rabbinical commentary this idea becomes crystal clear.</p>

<p>True dat. The Enlightenment movement was a European 19th century Jewish movement that sought to abolish the Jewish religion and replace it with a Jewish nationality. Zionism was an outgrowth of that. It never took root in Asia Minor and North Africa so most Mizrahi Jews never even knew there was such a concept until they were refugeed to Israel.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Meh. Maybe there are a couple. Certainly not a lot. And I doubt you&#39;ll find any that still identify themselves as Jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think the Zionists tried to force the concept of having a Jewish ethnicity/race so they could avoid being persecuted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably. Again, Zionism is an outgrowth of the Enlightenment one state goal of which was to avoid persecution by dropping religion. One early Zionist plan was to have all Jews convert to Christianity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole idea is laughed upon in the Arab World</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that Judaism is misunderstood in places where there are few Jews and where anti-Jewish hostility exists, so I wouldn&#39;t put much backing on what the Arab world thinks about Jews. I would venture to guess that most Muslims in the Middle East don&#39;t understand that there is a difference between Jews, Israelis and Zionists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no question that the Zionist State of Israel is racist, and there is nothing wrong with that claim. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more Arabs in the Knesset than there are blacks, Asians and Hispanics in Congress and the Senate. There are 2000+ strong Arabs and Druze serving in the IDF. There are Arabic TV and radio stations. Every public sign must be written in Arabic and Hebrew. Arab Israelis are generally much more supportive of the State of Israel than virtually any other Muslim group in the world. Sure there&#39;s some discrimination, but to say that &quot;the State&quot; is racist is taking things a little too far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think Judaism is racist if you follow the true peaceful message of the Torah, but sadly a small proportion of Jews follow it these days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Orthodox Jews number about 30% of Israelis and 20% in the rest of the world. Out of them, about 30% are Haredi and believe that Zionism runs against the Torah (<em>not</em> Neturei Karta/Torah Jews against Zionism. They are a tiny fringe group of 20-30 men that has long been ostracized from even the most Anti-Zionist religious groups). Out of the remaining 70% religious Jews, a huge percentage of them are left wingers and against many practices in the State of Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way to stop Zionism is for Jews to wake up and understand that Israel is destroying their religious belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Israel has actually made huge inroads into accepting religious Jews. In the 1950s they made a concentrated effort to brainwash Sephardic children that religion is outdated and Judaism=Zionism. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because Arabs make up more than 20% of the population of Israel. They&#39;d never vote for an Israeli Jew because of the crimes of Israel and the illegal occupation of Palestinian land.</p>

<p>Also, having only 2000 IDF soldiers from Arab and Druze origins from a total population of over 1.5 million Arabs clearly indicates that they&#39;re not happy serving in the Israeli Army.</p>

<p>If you want to defend the crimes of Zionist Israel you can start by explaining the illegal occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights plus the Gaza blockade. There are over <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/jewish-population-west-bank-up">350,000</a> illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank alone and numbers have doubled in 12 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have been misinformed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything racist about Judaism, but I will assume you are referring to the concept of &quot;Chosen people&quot; and to some aggressive quotes in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Chosen People: This concept has two roots.</p>

<p>1)As you know, Religion is used to explain that which people have trouble explaining. Throughout all of history, Jews have been a small and persecuted group of people, but despite that they always managed to not just survive, but to play an active roll in the world. Some Jews explain this phenomena with the concept that Jews were chosen by God to be his servants. Therefore, God makes sure that Jews continue to exist and play an active roll in the world.</p>

<p>2) According to Judaism, God occasionally chooses a group of people to reveal more of himself to. At one point, God chose to reveal more of himself to the Jews, hence Jews were a &quot;chosen people&quot;. But, Jews were not the first or the last to be chosen. Some directions of Judaism say that there is no group that has not been chosen. It&#39;s an abstract concept, just like God.</p>

<p>Also, loves all people, regardless of whether they&#39;re Jewish or not. There is a Jewish story that talks about the Jews celebrating after God drowned the Egyptians who were chasing them to make them slaves. God sees the Jews celebrating and tells them &quot;Why are you celebrating when I have just killed so many of my children?&quot;</p>

<p>Aggressive quotes in the old testament:</p>

<p>The old testament was written over 3000 years ago! Some parts were written almost 5000 years ago! If you take it literally and apply it to the world today, of course it&#39;s a load of crap. It&#39;s supposed to be understood non-literally, and within historical context. Jews know that, and that&#39;s why most Jews describe themselves as non-Religious, despite claiming to have a religion.</p>

<p>In fact, there is nothing in Judaism that supports converting others to Judaism. Judaism is a philosophy based on Jewish history. If someone non-Jewish finds it useful, great! But there is nothing in Judaism that says that everyone has to be Jewish. Other people have their own histories, and their own philosophies based on them, so it wouldn&#39;t make sense for them to have to follow the Jewish philosophy.</p>

<p>Culturally, Jews almost always lived as a minority, and co-existence with other cultures is a big part of Jewish culture and philosophy. Racism is considered horrible in Jewish culture.</p>

<p>As for Israel, it is not Racist. All Israeli citizens have equal rights, regardless of their background. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh really?</p>

<p>A very good Israeli friend of mine, a rabbi actually, married a Palestinian woman.</p>

<p>After he did this he lost his job at University of Tel Aviv and became ineligible (unofficially) for a job anywhere in Israel. He remained basically unemployed (yet publicly protested the very Zionism that ruined him) until the day he died; a third-class citizen in the country that he fought to bring into existence.</p>

<p>There is no way around it; Israel is a criminal apartheid terror state that is, as I type this, engaging in the very same crimes that the Nazis did before them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice try at discrediting me there. Unfortunately (for you) you are systematically failing and just looking like an idiot.</p>

<p>You and I both know that I didn&#39;t &quot;forget&quot; one thing. I will NEVER forget the terror state of Israel--nor will I forget many of the AWESOME people that I met and am friends with &#39;till this day. I&#39;m even &quot;hosting&quot; the rabbi&#39;s son next summer in America it looks like.</p>

<p>Are you fucking high? I&#39;m not giving out his name! The poor man has been through enough.</p>

<p>He is an orthodox Ashkenazi Jew. His family is also involved with Neturei Karta--which is all you need to know.</p>

<p>If you would have read the comment I TOLD you the university (University of Tel Aviv). What are you having trouble understanding? 
I posted basically his entire life&#39;s story and why he&#39;s an anti-Zionist two days ago; did you not read it? Look through my comment history if you want to know more about my &quot;story&quot; of how I know rabbi M and his good family.</p>

<p>I have no reason to &quot;forget&quot; anything; in fact, I said more than I should have. Don&#39;t believe me? Tough shit. <strong>I</strong> know its true and so does rabbi M--some random guy on Reddit means jack shit to me. I only come here to tell the truth and to learn the truth from others. The JIDF and ADL may not like it but they can go to hell. This information needs to be out there.</p>

<p>I certainly am sorry that I didn&#39;t &quot;out&quot; the rabbi&#39;s name but fuck you and your suggestions that I&#39;ve been less than forthcoming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you picked &quot;Neturei Karta&quot; because it&#39;s the only Orthodox organization of anti-Zionists that is widely known (mainly due to their extreme beliefs and loud noises). The fact remains that there are less than a few <em>dozen</em> Neturei Karta families world wide. In 1967, when you say that he lost he job, it was even less. There are very few ordained Rabbis in the organization and precious few members who have any sort of higher secular education as they shun it by principle. To say that a Neturei Karta member or even an Orthodox Jew was a professor in Tel Aviv U, a very secular college, is very hard to believe.</p>

<p>If he is an Orthodox Ashkenazi Jew, he would not have married an Arab who didn&#39;t convert. If she converted, then he would not have any sort of issues with his friends and family as that is widely accepted. I think you have that part of the story wrong somehow.</p>

<p>You see why I am skeptical of your comments. Also when having discussions with you in the past, you&#39;ve stumbled and came up with some bizarre explanations for some of your comments. The one that particularly stands out was a comment of yours on the infamous video of a group of Israelis saying that they took out their video cameras to &quot;document the event&quot; regarding 9/11. You confirmed that the Hebrew translation was correct. When I questioned your Hebrew speaking ability, you mentioned that you don&#39;t but your mom &quot;understands a little&quot;. When I questioned the fact that the video was dubbed into English and the Hebrew completely missing from the audio you replied with, and I quote, &quot;She read their lips&quot;. </p>

<p>So, yeah. Combined with the fact that most of your comments bolster hateful sentiment (Holocaust denial, Protocols of the Elders of Zion, etc) makes me extremely skeptical when you start with these stories of people &quot;you know&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you remember correctly...</p>

<p>I had no idea what Neturei Karta was, and still do not really. I know that they are Jews against Zionism, and one of my hosts was aligned with them (though I didn&#39;t remember the name and WOULD never had until, actually, you brought it up to me). Neturei Karta had nothing to do with the meeting that I attended in Chicago, nor are they affiliated with &quot;Jews Against Zionism&quot;--though this is exactly what they do--Neturei Karta is mainly made up of HIGHLY Orthodox Jews who do NOT toe the Israeli&#39;s &quot;party line&quot; and make no bones about this fact. Most of them are located far away from me though--in New York and Israel. Rabbi M was affiliated with NK somehow but I have do idea if he was a &quot;member&quot; or just supported them and have not talked to him since he visited Virginia about 5 years back.</p>

<p>Actually, his wife DID convert--and he STILL had tons of trouble, and so did she. She is not considered a &quot;real Jew&quot; in Israel and is therefore WAAAY down in the pecking order--just above an Arab actually. She lost her job at the school where she worked (a Palestinian school) because it took her sometimes HOURS to make it through the FIVE checkpoints she had to cross to get into Jenin (where she was laughed at, spit on, and treated like cattle--luckily the IDF Major, when he was there, <em>loved</em> her and used to take his men to task when he saw this. </p>

<p>Please note that rabbi M didn&#39;t lose his REAL friends--he had business acquaintances he had worked with for years shun him. Merchants, service employees, that sort. But he DID lose friends. To be fair, so did his wife for converting. So much for &quot;equality&quot; in racist Marxist Israel, huh? </p>

<p>You should visit more often and see this blatant racism with your own eyes.</p>

<p>The video...we both know that you can hear <em>some</em> Hebrew--enough at points to make translations based on both sounds and lip movements--but my grandpop (long dead) was the Hebrew speaker, so I wouldn&#39;t know. My Mom can only catch words here and there. I sincerely DOUBT this translation is bad because, if so, where is the &quot;good&quot; one? You and I both know that, if a &quot;correct&quot; translation DID exist, the ADL would have rolled that bitch out years ago. The reason? The <em>real</em> video is the one that&#39;s up on YouTube for all of us to see. And we both know, even with assholes talking over a lot of it, that the translations were correct. The men didn&#39;t PULL OFF 9/11 after all---they were only sent here by their Mossad bosses (who DID pull off 9/11) to &quot;document&quot; the event. I mean, if fake that overdubbed vid could have said--&quot;these men know that they were working for the people who brought down WTC--what do they have to say??&quot;</p>

<p>They said almost nothing--nothing that implicated themselves or Mossad. Good little soldiers.</p>

<p>Anyhow, what would the explanation be from these &quot;dancing Israelis&quot;?? &quot;Oh, were just Mossad agents, and were having some fun with our new cameras taking pix of both planes crashing that we had prior knowledge of AND photographing out lit Zippos in front of the demolished wreckage! Yeah, it&#39;s PRETTY WEIRD that we had a camera rolling when the first and second airplanes hit...and then the Bergen NJ police find us, our cameras, $5k in cash in an old sock, and explosives residue WHILE WE JUST HAPPEN to be dressed in Arab garb and telling the police that &quot;Palestinians are your problem, not us!&quot;</p>

<p>Do you not consider this &quot;news??&quot; Hell, it&#39;s the fucking <em>smoking gun</em>! </p>

<p>Yet, the MSM buried it as usual.</p>

<p>I am now more convinced than ever than you are smoking crack...at least a <em>little</em> right? You can tell me.</p>

<p>I played that video MONTHS ago to a deaf-mute who both speaks Hebrew AND ASL and he confirms that the english overdub is accurate (from what he can see)--with the exception of a few non-critical words. If YOU would like to do the same thing bring the video over to a <em>shul</em> for the disabled. We have nearly 10 within 50 miles from me and they&#39;d be happy to help you.</p>

<p>Be skeptical all you&#39;d like--I have nothing to hide. Trust me--the way things are going in the world right now I <em>wish</em> I was not Jewish! The backlash is coming and coming fast. Finkelstein, Kissinger, etc. are correct with that fact!</p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;m not a &quot;good Jew&quot; so things more deeply involved in Judaism are not going to be things that I know about. In fact, I didn&#39;t even begin my fight against Zionism until after my grandpop died--so I am just getting started learning and speaking out. I&#39;m also slowly learning Hebrew.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment anyways! Sorry it didn&#39;t have its intended effect, but thanks.</p>

<p>Meaning of or relating to Judaism?</p>

<p>And Israeli is the adjective form of Israel? (Israelite is the personal noun form of israel, so to say &quot;israel is the israelite state&quot; is redundant and nonsensical.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Jewish&quot; has two meanings, one being the adjective form of Judaism, and the other being the adjective form of Jews. Israelite is an older word for Jews, just like Hebrews. Jews have been around for a while, so there are more than one word to describe them. Israeli is the adjective form of Israel the country. Israelite is used only to refer to a person. Here&#39;s why:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a people called the Hebrews. According to Hebrew legend, all Hebrews are descendant from a guy named Israel. So, the Hebrews also call themselves Israelites. At one point, the Hebrews/Israelites create a country and name it &quot;Israel&quot; after their legendary common ancestor. </p>

<p>There was a province of Israel called Judea. At a later point in history, it becomes it&#39;s own country. Shortly after that, the rest of Israel got conquered. Some time after that, Judea reclaimed the lands of the rest of Israel that were previously conquered. The &quot;new&quot; Hebrew/Israelite state was officially still called Judea, but some loosely called it Israel. The Hebrews/Israelites who lived there started being called Judeans, and other Hebrews/Israelites around the world started being called Judeans regardless of whether they were from the province Judea.</p>

<p>So, the Judeans/Hebrew/Israelites, have a religion that only they follow. It&#39;s based on Judean/Hebrew/Israelite history, so people started calling the religion &quot;Judaism&quot;. Kind of like lumping Greek culture, philosophy, mythology, and religion together and calling it &quot;Greekism&quot;.</p>

<p>Jew is a short form of Judean, which was originally a derogatory term, but became accepted in the western countries as a normal term. Today, the word Jewish can be an adjective of anything relating to Jews, including but not limited to the Jewish religion Judaism.</p>

<p>So back to Judea/Israel... It was later conquered by Romans, and then Arabs, and then someone else, and then Turks, and then English, and then with cooperating with the English the Jews/Judeans/Hebrews/Israelites got it back again. They officially called it Israel. Anything from there is called &quot;Israeli&quot;. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to call anything from there &quot;Israelite&quot; because Israelite is only used to refer to people.</p>

<p>Thing is, in the English world, the word commonly used to refer to Israelites is &quot;Jews&quot;, so when speaking English, people call Israel the Jewish state. In Russia, for example, the proper way to refer to Israelites is Hebrews, so when speaking Russian, people call Israel the Hebrew state.</p>

<p>The fact that the name of the Jewish religion sounds similar to the English way of referring to the Jewish ethnic group, does create confusion. Hopefully I cleared that up for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, so why don&#39;t we just use the word israelite to refer to the ethnic group?</p>

<p>It couldn&#39;t be because there are a lot of muslims who would meet that criteria could it?</p>

<p>naw</p>

<p>no chance</p>

<p>Oh and by the way</p>

<p>According to the state of israel</p>

<p>Jewish has a very specific meaning</p>

<p>If you are jewish you get citizenship!</p>

<p>and guess what</p>

<p>according to their definition</p>

<p>Sammy davis jr. isn&#39;t jewish</p>

<p>Oh and all this semantics surrounding the &quot;jewish state&quot;</p>

<p>its all doublespeak</p>

<p>You just admitted that it&#39;s doublespeak</p>

<p>It allows people to be racist while at the same time claiming they are not</p>

<p>It is disgusting and your attempts to defend it are the same</p>

<p>Your philosophy is as morally bankrupt as your theology</p>

<p>At the end of the day</p>

<p>You cannot deny</p>

<p>The word jewish is inherently exclusive</p>

<p>So when you say &quot;jewish democracy&quot;</p>

<p>you are saying</p>

<p>&quot;exclusive democracy&quot;</p>

<p>which is an oxymoron</p>

<p>as democracy means inclusive</p>

<p>Oh and the fact that you use religious mythology which has been thoroughly disproven by archaeology and anthropology - it doesn&#39;t make me trust your intellect very much or your critical reasoning</p>

<p>then again the fact that you have to type this much to explain how &quot;jewish state&quot; isn&#39;t racist/exclusive</p>

<p>is how I know I&#39;m right</p>

<p>It means quite another when speaking with other &quot;jews&quot;</p>

<p>Those with intellectual honesty who have jewish heritage but do not practice judaism do not call themselves jewish. They call themselves of jewish heritage. </p>

<p>These language games have got to stop</p>

<p>I know what you mean</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know what I mean</p>

<p>Because you are obscuring it from your awareness</p>

<p>intentionally</p>

<p>because you&#39;re jewish</p>

<p>so to admit some nefarious intent on the part of the jewish state</p>

<p>is to admit your own nefarious intent</p>

<p>which you may or may not have</p>

<p>but my aligning your identity with that of the modern &quot;israeli secular jew&quot;</p>

<p>you have chosen to be exclusive</p>

<p>and racist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Few other ethnicities have been around as long as the Jews. Few other ethnicities follow a religion that doesn&#39;t preach conversion, and hence are approximately the only ethnic group following that religion. Few other ethnicities have to deal with people denying their identity and their right to live in their country. Few ethnicities have a homeland on land as stretegic for empires to control, as Israel. No other ethnicities fit all of the above conditions. I agree, Jews are a unique group, that call for unique explanations.</p>

<p>Jews have been around for roughly 4000 years. It&#39;s no surprise that they&#39;ve been called by different names throughout the years, and no surprise that that could cause confusion. The overwhelming majority of today&#39;s ethnic groups are much younger than the Jews, so of course explaining Jewish history is more complicated than explaining the history of the average ethnic group.</p>

<p>So when faced with something more complicated than average, you can try extra hard to try to understand it, or you can say &quot;There&#39;s no way something could be this complicated. It must be a lie&quot;. I recommend the former.</p>

<p>...All Israeli citizens have equal rights, regardless of their background</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is meant to be a joke, right?</p>

<p>Because, my friend, NOTHING is further from the truth.</p>

<p>Try being an Israeli citizen as an Israeli Arab.</p>

<p>I have seen this with my own eyes! There is BLATANT racism in every single aspect of day-to-day Israeli life--from the jobs you can get to the roads you can drive on.</p>

<p>Basically, Ashkenazi Jews receive the benefits of full citizens. Diaspora Jews from America come second. Next are the Sephardic Jews, followed by the &quot;lesser&quot; Jews (as they call them)--African Jews and the like. These are followed by Arab Jews.</p>

<p>Finally, at the very bottom, are the Moslems and the Christians.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what cracks me up about Christian Zionists. If they spent ONE HOUR in Israel they would realize that Israelis are NO friends to Christians! I watched a totally white-bread American Christian family get <em>mercilessly</em> teased, yelled at, and spit on by nearly 15 people JUST BECAUSE they were Christians. It was utterly disgusting--and this was NOT a unique situation. There are hundreds of vids on YouTube showing the same thing--the JIDF has removed most of them, but there are still some left.</p>

<p>Israel is, far and away, the most racist rogue terror state since 1939 Germany. Period.</p>

<p>See, the country&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s doing a pretty good job considering the surroundings it has to deal with.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we both agree that the IsraelI <em>people</em> are not the problem.</p>

<p>The people I met in Israel were the best ever; Jews and Arabs both. They were also, by FAR, more aware and awake re: world issues than any group of folks that I&#39;ve ever met. My host family in Israel were both antizionists and fighters for the rights of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>Plus, as I said, NOBODY knows how to party like the Israelis! Strange when you remember that in Israel even energy drinks are illegal...yet ecstasy is consumed like Tylenol! :-)</p>

<p>Indeed, I never had as much fun as I did in Tel Aviv. Great people, great music, great fun all around.</p>

<p>I just pray the Zionists don&#39;t force Israel into a war that is unwanted by the people...VERY many Israelis that I met did not like their government all that much. I was there before Rabin was killed and peace was <em>this</em> close! It totally sucked when I found out that, inevitably, he was murdered. Very sad; if allowed to live Israel would have been a far better place IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad we agree on many things. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think saving Rabin would have created peace to be honest. It also wasn&#39;t the only time that Israel was close to making a peace deal. If peace were to ever come to Israel, it would leave Palestinian terrorist organizations with no more source of cash. The terrorists know this, and that&#39;s why whenever Israel comes close to a peace deal, terrorists attack Israel, provoking a response, and the peace deal falls through. This pattern continues to this day. </p>

<p>If Rabin had been saved, I see no reason why the same pattern wouldn&#39;t still continue. Look what happened with Gaza. The whole territory was returned, and as a result the situation got less peaceful. Today many Gazans (especially women) are quietly talking about how much better it was under Israeli rule.</p>

<p>Also, what do you mean by the word &quot;Zionist&quot;? The word is used to mean different things, and I just want to be sure I understand you correctly.</p>

You are not going to burn in hell you are going to burn on a material Darwinian earth etc.  Everybody else is a lot more confused. </p>

The situation in the middle east is filled with hatred on both sides. Think about it using the common analogy of Iran being surrounded by US military based. It&#39;s the same situation for Israel, they are surrounded by countries who do not want them there. The only thing maintaining that balance is Israel&#39;s vast military/US(NATO) support. Saying this doesn&#39;t excuse Israels behavior towards Palestine, I just feel more context should be added to this discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true.  Have you even read the New Testament?  Jesus taught his disciples to love their enemies and to be meek and humble.  Jesus taught that the first shall be last and the last shall be first while the Jews of the Old Testament teach that the Jews shall always be first because God wills it.  Jesus blessed the Gentile woman who pleaded for his help.  Jesus never once said it&#39;s us versus them.  I agree that this is how most christians think but that is only because they haven&#39;t read their New Testaments, or because they have listened to their corrupted religious institutions which have fed them lies about how the Old Testament and New Testament are one book written by God that therefore must be interpreted as one message (which is impossible).  The Old Testament (judaism) an New Testament (christianity) couldn&#39;t be ANY MORE DIFFERENT.  The messages contained in each of these texts are absolutely irreconcilable.</p>

<p>I think you mean</p>

<p>&quot;This is not permitted under my understanding of the law of the new testament&quot;</p>

<p>Any text which does not confer instant understanding is not perfect or infallible.</p>

<p>Obviously people can read the same book and come away with a different message. Are you going to try to say these people didn&#39;t read the bible?</p>

<p>&quot;By the end of the Medieval period, enslavement of Christians had been largely abolished throughout Europe, <strong>although enslavement of non-Christians remained an open question.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since the Middle Ages, the Christian understanding of slavery has seen significant internal conflict and endured dramatic change. <strong>Nearly all Christian leaders before the late 17th century regarded slavery as consistent with Christian theology</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>It took reading that book for 1600 years to figure out that slavery is wrong?</p>

<p>What a great book it must be!!!!</p>

<p>like OMG</p>

<p>like for reals </p>

<p>oh my god</p>

<p>so good</p>

<p>good god</p>

<p>god damn</p>

<p>soul vibrations</p>

<p>why hate it?</p>

<p>when you really could be lovin it</p>

<p>you know we holdin that heat like an oven mitt</p>

<p>The fact that people can be this devout (you cannot argue that some of the worst sinners have been some of the most devout christians - the inquisitors, these phalange militias, slave owning confederates who were extremely religious; as a side note, jesus tells a slave to obey his master, as his master should obey god. kinda fucked up if you ask me - he even recommends a slave return himself to his owner. but yeah no way to misconstrue that message!)</p>

<p>&quot;In the registering of &quot;nationality&quot; on Israeli Teudat Zehut (&quot;identity card&quot;), which is administered by the Ministry of the Interior, a person had to meet the halakhic definition to be registered as a &quot;Jew&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>halakhic definition = your mother was a practicing religious jew or descended maternally from one</p>

<p>&quot;As a result, mere belief in the principles of Judaism does not make one a Jew. Similarly, non-adherence by a Jew to the 613 Mitzvot, or even formal conversion to another faith, does not make one lose one&#39;s Jewish status. Thus the immediate descendants of all female Jews (even apostates) are still considered to be Jews, as are those of all their female descendants. Even those descendants who are not aware they are Jews, or practice a faith other than Judaism, are defined by this perspective as Jews, as long as they come from an unbroken female line of descent. As a corollary, the children of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother are not considered to be Jews by halakha unless they formally convert according to halakha, even if raised fully observant in the mitzvot&quot;</p>

<p>so basically yeah its not a religion, it&#39;s institutionalized racism</p>

<p>way better!</p>

<p>It is also a great way to guarantee inbreeding - No jewish man is going to marry outside his tribe if it means cursing his descendants</p>

<p>Keep everything &quot;in the family&quot; as it were</p>

<p>Also explains all the genetic diseases ashkenazi jews get</p>

<p>Just like purebreed dogs have all kinds of genetic issues from years of inbreeding</p>

<p>Ashkenazi&#39;s have them from millenia of it</p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t a racist statement, it is a statement of fact. Just like irish people have red hair and pale skin (everyone living on an island? there&#39;s gonna be some in breeding) or british royalty have hemophilia, or icelandic people have pale skin and white hair</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true.  Have you even read the New Testament?  Jesus taught his disciples to love their enemies and to be meek and humble.  Jesus taught that the first shall be last and the last shall be first while the Jews of the Old Testament teach that the Jews shall always be first because God wills it.  Jesus blessed the Gentile woman who pleaded for his help.  Jesus never once said it&#39;s us versus them.  I agree that this is how most christians think but that is only because they haven&#39;t read their New Testaments, or because they have listened to their corrupted religious institutions which have fed them lies about how the Old Testament and New Testament are one book written by God that therefore must be interpreted as one message (which is impossible).  The Old Testament (judaism) an New Testament (christianity) couldn&#39;t be ANY MORE DIFFERENT.  The messages contained in each of these texts are absolutely irreconcilable.</p>

<p>Except that the notion that the state must be controlled by Jews is baked into the country&#39;s DNA: it&#39;s a democracy founded on enshrining the dominance of one demographic. If you&#39;re a different race living in Israel, you&#39;re always going to know in the back of your mind that you&#39;re not part of the ruling tribe.</p>

<p>This is meant to be a joke, right?</p>

<p>Because, my friend, NOTHING is further from the truth.</p>

<p>Try being an Israeli citizen as an Israeli Arab.</p>

<p>I have seen this with my own eyes! There is BLATANT racism in every single aspect of day-to-day Israeli life--from the jobs you can get to the roads you can drive on.</p>

<p>Basically, Ashkenazi Jews receive the benefits of full citizens. Diaspora Jews from America come second. Next are the Sephardic Jews, followed by the &quot;lesser&quot; Jews (as they call them)--African Jews and the like. These are followed by Arab Jews.</p>

<p>Finally, at the very bottom, are the Moslems and the Christians.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what cracks me up about Christian Zionists. If they spent ONE HOUR in Israel they would realize that Israelis are NO friends to Christians! I watched a totally white-bread American Christian family get <em>mercilessly</em> teased, yelled at, and spit on by nearly 15 people JUST BECAUSE they were Christians. It was utterly disgusting--and this was NOT a unique situation. There are hundreds of vids on YouTube showing the same thing--the JIDF has removed most of them, but there are still some left.</p>

<p>Israel is, far and away, the most racist rogue terror state since 1939 Germany. Period.</p>
