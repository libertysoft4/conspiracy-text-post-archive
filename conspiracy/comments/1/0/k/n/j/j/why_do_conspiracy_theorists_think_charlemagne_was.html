        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This claim is pretty silly. The Carolingians were court officials for some of the local Merovingian rulers, not Merovingians themselves. Eventually the Merovingians had a string of bad luck with a series of &quot;royal minorities&quot; who were bribed into giving away huge chunks of their estates (hilariously, some were even bribed with candy). Carolingians just happened to be one of the dynasties feasting on the remains, and Charles Martel happened to be an extremely effective military commander.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know very little on the subject, but here is a quote from a book I read recently titled, Illuminati and Terrorism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Carolingians were partly of Merovingian descent, but more importantly, they represented the union of the once divided lineage of the Mithraic bloodline.  This lineage had survived in two branches. </p>

<p>Julia, the heiress of the Edomite royal bloodline, was the daughter of Herod Phollio King of Chalcis, whose grandfather was Herod the Great, and whose mother was the daughter of Salome, married Tigranes King of Armenia, the son of Alexander of Judea.  Their son Alexander married Iotape of Commagene, the daughter of Antiochus 
IV.  From them was descended St. Arnulf, a Frankish noble who had great 
influence in the Merovingian kingdoms as Bishop of Metz, and who was later 
canonized as a saint, and who lived from 582 to 640 AD.</p>

<p>In St. Arnulf, this lineage was united with the other branch.  That other 
branch was survived in the priest-pings of Emesa, descended from Claudia, 
the grand-daughter of the Emperor Claudius, which had also culminated in 
the person of the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus.
Saint Arnulf was the 
grandfather of Peppin II, the father of Charles Martel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, western geneologies before the 11th century are pure shit, mostly invented centuries later. Franks in the 8th century were so illiterate they had to import Irish monks during the Carolingian renaissance to teach them how to write their own language. Charlemagne himself couldn&#39;t even write his own name!</p>

<p>Franks were so illiterate in fact, that throughout most of the early middle ages they didn&#39;t even know the french language they were speaking wasn&#39;t actual Latin. Charlemagne was freaked out whe he learned this, because he thought God wouldn&#39;t understand his prayers if he didn&#39;t say them in Latin.</p>

<p>And even among the literate, 99.99% of what was written was church related because they had no paper in Europe at that time - paper was still made in the middle east, which was occupied by muslims who were no longer trading with western europe. Western europeans could only write on parchment or vellum, which was so expensive that a single bible required hides from hundreds of cattle.</p>

<p>So anyone who claims to know anyhing definitive about anyone&#39;s family tree/geneology stretching back from the 9th to the 6th centuries is absolutely full of shit. Accurate genologies for western europe ceased to exist in the 5th century and did not become reliable again until the 12th century. The notion that you can trace a bloodline from 12th century France to ancient Egypt or whatever is laughable on its face.</p>

<p>You found no primary sources because there are none. Only sources written centuries later.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. Like I said, there are no contemporaneous records that back up any your claims. Furthermore the Carolinigians were not even royalty until several generations after Charles Martel. So even if Europeans were keeping records of royalty, they would not be keeping records on Carolingians who were not royalty.</p>

<p>Not that it matters, since there are NO reliable genealogical records from that era. I mean absolutely NONE. The Franks are a mystery between the collapse of the western Roman empire and the high middle ages. We simply do not know what was happening there, because the only people who kept anything like accurate records were the Romans, and they stopped keeping records in those areas in the 5th century. Read up on Merovech and you&#39;ll find all kinds of crazy nonsense about how his father was a sea monster or something. This was the purported founder of the Merovingian clan, and we don&#39;t even have conclusive evidence that he even existed. That should clue you in to the quality of record keeping from that era.</p>

<p>I hope this clarifies things for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also nonsense. The most notable European monarchs of the high middle ages were actually descendants of vikings. The word &quot;Norman&quot; is derived from &quot;norseman.&quot; They were literally vikings who camped out in an area of northern France (Normandy). </p>

<p>Funnily enough, at the time the Normans conquered England, England was mostly being ruled by Danes who arrived there centuries earlier (old England was called the Danelaw, land where Danish law controlled). England just got passed around from one viking tribe to another like the Stanley Cup.</p>

<p>And Vikings were no friends of the Carolingians. In fact the primary reason why the Carolinigians died out as a political force was because the vikings bled the country dry and looted all the money. They were actually enslaving franks and selling them as slaves to arabs.</p>
