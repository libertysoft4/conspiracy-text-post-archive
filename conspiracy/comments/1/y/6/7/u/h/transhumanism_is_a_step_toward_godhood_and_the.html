        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><blockquote>
<p>The current power elite began the endgame of its 500-year Enlightement project about one hundred years ago. The coming of the Great War was the beginning of the end of Western civilization: the finish for Christendom. With the four great Christian empires destroyed, the next step was the destruction of capitalism, which destruction was called the Great Depression, followed by the takedown of ethnic and racial solidarity in World War II. The wreck of the nuclear family was triggered by the rise of Rosie the Riveter; the advent of feminism, legal contraception, and easy divorce meant curtains for the family. Stripped of Church, race, nation, market, and family, Western man was left with no loyalty but to his own senses. This was manifested in the rise of rock and roll and the drug culture, which led to the collapse of the social order in the West.</p>

<p>The shots fired in Dealey Plaza were the starting gun of the final phase, the consolidation of humanity. Now, even loyalty to self became treasonous. From 1963 on, it was no longer enough to live for oneself. From then on, one had to belong to the Movement. It was no longer permitted to pass one&#39;s life in self-absorbed stupor, drunk or drugged out and not giving sweet f.a. about the world Now one was obligated to Give A Damn. &quot;If you&#39;re not part of the solution, you&#39;re part of the problem.&quot;</p>

<p>And so the early 1960s passed into history, and with it the Piscean age of the Fish, the icthus. Now began the age of the Illuminated Man, the demigod who could carry his own water: the Age of Aquarius. Now the power elite rolled out the first iteration of the global superstate. Its mission: to take the place of Church, race, nation, market and family. God was dead; the Earth (as defined by the power elite) became the new deity of Western man. Racial loyalty for white people became the ultimate sin, a slap in the face of Saint Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Junior, pbuh, who died for white America&#39;s sins. Humanity was all one race now -- or so the power elite told us. Nations? Just lines on maps, man. It&#39;s a small world after all. One world or none! Markets? Just another way Whitey keep the poor man down. the power elite would act to feed the children who don&#39;t have enough to eat, shoe the children with no shoes on their feet, house the people livin&#39; in the street. Oh, there&#39;s a solution: the welfare state.</p>

<p>And the family? There is no such thing. A family is nothing but whatever the power elite happens to be pointing at when you say the word &quot;family&quot;. Besides, mom and dad are getting divorced. They&#39;re not in love any more. And love is just chemicals in your brain anyway. Have a pill.</p>

<p>And so here we are, on the threshold of Utopia. The power elite has saved us from the ruin of Western, Christian civilization -- a ruin they themselves made -- and set us on the parapet of their Earthly paradise, ordem ab chao. We ought to be happy.</p>

<p>But with each step along the road to the immanentization of the Eschaton, we have grown more miserable, less human. Why?</p>

<p>Because deep in our hearts we know it&#39;s all fake..</p>

<p>Reality is graven on our hearts by God. We know the brick and stone tower to heaven that the modern Nimrod has built, the false unity he has forged, is a lie. Deep down, we long for the real God, the real family, the real nations and races and markets we once knew.</p>

<p>But we can&#39;t admit it. Oh no. Our friends on Facebook would Unlike us. We dare not admit that this glorious New Order of the Ages is a pyramid built on sand, and the Light we desire above all is generated by the burning blood of children in the belly of Moloch. If we were to do that, we&#39;d have to bow down to someone -- to our neighbors, to some priest, to a king, to God.</p>

<p>And we can&#39;t have that. The power elite will have no other gods before itself. Stray from the fold and you lose your friends, your job, your precious self-esteem. Go back to the old God and sooner or later the men in black helmets come crashing through the door of your &quot;compound&quot;.</p>

<p>And so we go on day to day, pretending that evil is good, death is life, lies are truth, until we are mad, tranqilized, drugged up, or dead.</p>

<p>The next step: the abolition of man. For the power elite knows full well, that the longing for truth -- the true God, the real family, the actual races and nations -- is inextricably linked to human nature. No matter how much we bury it under layers of atheism, materialism, hedonism, and ideology, every human being is ultimately longing out for that which is Real.</p>

<p>And since the goal of the power elite is to define Reality itself -- see Genesis 3:22 -- then it cannot tolerate any reality but its own. If human nature cannot be seperated from its loyalty to Reality, then human nature itself must be destroyed.</p>

<p>Hello, Transhumanism: the Final Solution to the Human Question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Transhumanists will never be persecuted by the dying culture of the bible belt when so many people are becoming materialists. If anything the inverse of that wager is true.</p>

<p>Transhumanism and humanism are incompatible. To advocate for transhumanism is to advocate for the destruction of humanity. If you feel that is harsh please let me know why.</p>

<p>The idea that technology breakthroughs like immortality will be available for even a modest slice of the population is naive. The idea that these new beings will respect us humans is naive. Do us humans care about mosquitoes? From what I&#39;ve heard their advancement will be so fast and significant that they&#39;ll probably kill us without second thought.</p>

<p>As an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism">idealist</a> atheist oppose to the average materialist one... This train of thought horrifies me. Humans can become greater than what we are now by the ways we&#39;ve become greater than what we&#39;ve been. By learning from our mistakes and by overcoming obstacles.</p>

<p>We could very well simply be organisms like any other. But that doesn&#39;t give some the right to believe we should or need to be manipulated and controlled to meet our maximum potential. Or that their view on that potential is the most preferred.</p>

<p>Any transhumanist argument championing a better humanity is a lie. It WILL be our downfall against the autistic alienated hipster, who only wants to bring us emotional beings down to their level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i can understand why you might fear it but who knows how it will change us. it could be for the better or for the worse but we wont know till it happens. Its not like you won&#39;t be able to continue living on and die, as is the current structure. If you are talking about the future of humanity, then why is this the correct path? Why are you scared of change? As a human like you, I know death is at the end of the current road and I am ok with it. However, I am interested to see what can change and have no problem exploring it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m scared of class differences becoming genetic differences. We haven&#39;t decided if caring about older species is ethical (monkeys and apes anyone?) and we can&#39;t assume how these new neohumans would reason regarding us. I fear the worst down that line of thinking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also scared of humans becoming some cog in some technological machine, and losing all that&#39;s left of our spiritual self. I understand and acknowledge that religion can and is destructive. But spirituality and monism is not. We could simply be reduced to a necessary worker of sorts, with the neohumans working on other roles, and us fashioning other technologically/genetically modified beings for other roles. Here we lose the family, the sense of oneness, and the sense of freedom.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a lot to worry about. Then again, I can see where you&#39;re coming from. I just don&#39;t see genetic engineering and technological mixing as healthy for our reproductive, familial and cultural structures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m feeling ya but:</p>

<p>There is a difference between technology as <em>prosthesis</em> and technology as <em>self</em>, we can only know about technology as <em>prosthesis</em> because technology as <em>self</em> hasn&#39;t occurred yet (this is commonly referred to as a <em>singularity</em>).  A cyborg is in the technology as <em>self</em> category.  </p>

<p>The &quot;essence of humanity&quot; <strong>is not</strong> &quot;our ability to create technology&quot;, the essence of humanity is our ability to reason, perhaps what you mean to say is that humanity can only reflect upon humanity through technology, or that without the constant creation (or at least attempted creations) of new technology humanity wastes its essence.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is your definition, which is of course entirely contradictory to the long history of humans using technology. Heck, it isn&#39;t even a solely human trait. A cyborg is a human that uses technology. Yes, there is a pop-culture cyborg, but that&#39;s for comic books. The word Cyborg does not hail from that however. It hails from post WW2 scientific experiments. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;essence of humanity&quot; is not &quot;our ability to create technology&quot;, the essence of humanity is our ability to reason, perhaps what you mean to say is that humanity can only reflect upon humanity through technology, or that without the constant creation (or at least attempted creations) of new technology humanity wastes its essence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is subjective. I believe a key essence of humanity is our ability to manipulate technology. I certainly didn&#39;t mean to say whatever else you are saying. </p>

<p>How would you even know technology as self happened? We are a species that medicate ourselves with our technological medical revolutions. The origin of the term cyborg was from an experiment with a rat that had a osmotic pump surgically attached in order to mediate the release of chemicals into the rat&#39;s body. (I&#39;ll get the study and names for you when I get back to my textbook) If you think this is somehow fundamentally different from dosing yourself with a pill, <em>you</em> are confused.</p>

<p>I think there is also a notable irony in your entire assertion. To suggest that it&#39;s humanity&#39;s ability to reason that differentiates us but ignore all the technology we insert into that reason-process today is <em>silly</em>. Our ability to think, remember, desire, etc, is entirely mediated by technology.</p>

<p>We <em>ARE</em> cyborgs. I&#39;d love to go back and forth about this, but a warning. When I&#39;m done with work I&#39;m going to go home and pop out my Cyborg Theory textbook and refer to numerous academic pieces to prove my point.</p>

<p>Lol - I&#39;d maybe care if you bothered to illustrate your point instead of just stamping your feet. But have it your way!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You might want to work on reading that article because it doesn&#39;t exactly support your point. No one is arguing against cogito ergo sum, wondering how you even came to that conclusion.</p>

<p>The definition of cyborg from the article <strong>you</strong> linked:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The term cyborg is often applied to an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So that seems to be entirely in line with how I&#39;ve described and not in any way reflective of what you insisted (which if anything seems to be a take-off of the usage of the word in fiction... once again from wikipedia).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>enjoy being a cyborg :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No reason not to. Your attachments to the word cyborg are your own and project your own feelings in regards to it. Your experiences aren&#39;t universal truths and the history of humanity is one that involves technology in every step of the way. Furthermore, I think you should bother responding to my assertions before you give off <em>such</em> an attitude. </p>

<p>And who is the one here making those - ah right! <strong>You!!!!</strong></p>

<p>You see, it&#39;s not really outlandish if you can actually point to 60 years of scientific and academic agreement. But really - it <em>is</em> rude to just call people wrong and not engage them in a debate over why that&#39;s the case.

    <div class="md"><p>It feels like they lost the thread of what they wanted to say becuase they were trying to appeal to such a wide audience they couldn&#39;t get a coherent message through.</p>

<p>Like, okay you want to talk about how Transhumanism means the death of humanity but that&#39;s <strong>life as we know it</strong>: The old dies to make way for the new. </p>

<p>For some reason this rant is also racially tinted, the bias seems quite clear when I see that they want the return to &#39;the good ol&#39; days when black people had to sit in the back of the bus cause that meant white families could sit in front together, instead of having to sit in different rows because brown people got to those seats first.</p>

<p>I think this writer isn&#39;t all there, though they had something to say.</p>

<p>We are on the cusp of a new form of conciousness, and they don&#39;t like it cause they&#39;ve inferred it will not be White Men on top when Rich People can be any sex or colour. So they fear-monger to make you and me afraid, and hope we stop it before it comes to pass.</p>

<p>But I am not afraid of losing my identity. No I enjoy being Anonymous, I have fun being a hivemind. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even bother to downvote this cause it should be self-evident fear mongering by an ignorant person who doesn&#39;t understand what they&#39;re afraid of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Transhumanism isn&#39;t going to be available for the &quot;general public&quot;. I don&#39;t know why anyone who isn&#39;t an elite, or someone with an absurd amount of money would think that this &quot;movement&quot; is going to include them.</p>

<p>Transhumanism is more than likely going to achieve the means immortality, probably after the singularity. 
Keep this is mind. The global elite are mortals, when the technology becomes available, they will become immortal. If you think that the distribution of wealth is bad now, it is only going to get worse then.
It all boils down to power.
When man can merge themselves with machines, they are no longer human. When that day comes, the remaining humans will be looked down upon even more than what we are now.
Earth is not going to be a happy place.</p>

<p>Once again, if you are a normal person, not in any secret societies, not an insider, not apart of the 13 bloodlines, or if you don&#39;t have an amassed amount of physical wealth, you will never get the possibility of becoming a transhuman.</p>

<p>Unless of course, there is a deception involved. 
If that is the case, I am sure the zombie masses will gladly become one with the machine.
However, I could see that plan backfiring for the masses who choose to do so. hahahaha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t read the wall of text, but just based on the OP title, I would say this:</p>

<p><strong><em>Good</em></strong>.  If what you end up ultimately reaching is Godhood, then you actually <em>want</em> to get away from Humankind - <em>far</em> away from it.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see that?</p>

<p>I you have $100 in your pocket, and someone offers you the opportunity to have $1,000,000, you would say &quot;Na.  I&#39;m good with the $100.  Thanks.&quot;??</p>

<p>Really?  Why?</p>

<p>I guess you can stay with the $100 if you want.  I&#39;d step <em>way</em> up to the mil.</p>

<p>Now, to be sure, I&#39;m not necessarily advocating Transhumanism.  I don&#39;t know one way or the other if Transhumanism actually <em>does</em> indeed reach toward Godhood or not.  Maybe it claims to, but it doesn&#39;t really know what Godhood actually <em>is</em>.  If it really <em>is</em> reaching toward real and true Godhood, then that&#39;s a good thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not super sure that <em>any</em> human has a great grasp of what exactly Godhood is, however.</p>

<p>1)  What technology?  The &quot;technology&quot; to reach Godhood?  If that&#39;s what you&#39;re referring to, then that technology <em>already exists</em>.  That&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s easy, but A) we&#39;re already <em>all</em> on the path toward Godhood.  It&#39;s called <em>existence</em>.  Existing in itself is a path toward Source.  Additionally, B) there are certain paths (&quot;technologies&quot;, if you wish to call them that) that can get you to Godhood/God awareness a bit quicker than others.  Ultimately, however, we&#39;re already all on the path toward Source all the same.  There&#39;s no &quot;technology&quot; needed that we don&#39;t already have.</p>

<p>Aside from that, however, I&#39;m not super sure exactly what you mean with regard to the question you asked.  Do you mean:  &quot;Do you think that TPTB would make the technology that&#39;s able to achieve Godhood available to humanity?&quot;</p>

<p>Is <em>that</em> what you mean by that question?  And if so...why on Earth would you <em>ever</em> think that the technology to reach Godhood is somehow something that only TPTB or the elite would be able to have?  Nothing could be further from the actual truth.</p>

<p>If it <em>was</em> something that only the elite had, then of course they wouldn&#39;t give it to everyone else.  Do they give <em>anything</em> they have of worth to everyone else?  No.  They sequester their trinkets to themselves and hoard their material items so that everyone else has as little as possible.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, we&#39;re not talking about &quot;material items&quot; here.  &quot;God technology&quot; is not exclusively relegated to the material realm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, do you think that men trying to use technology to become Gods is ultimately a good thing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned nothing about Gods - plural.  There is no such thing actually.  The plural version of that is &quot;gods&quot; with a lower case &quot;g&quot; - in which case the individuals going by that title actually <em>aren&#39;t</em> &quot;gods&quot; at all, but simply beings that are (or <em>appear</em> to be) advanced in one certain area or the other.  Having some sort of advancement in one area or the other - almost regardless of what that area may be (physical, technological, mental, even spiritual) - does not in itself make one God.  It just makes one a bit more advanced in that particular are.  So what?  There&#39;s a <em>lot</em> more to The Whole than Its parts or even a sum thereof.</p>

<p>All this is to say that, while I mean absolutely <em>no</em> disrespect to you whatsoever, the question you asked here is actually a nonsensical one.  <del>Men</del> People will never become God in and of themselves anymore than they already <em>are</em>.  One can certainly enhance certain qualities that one has - become stronger, smarter, faster, more tolerant, more wise, more loving etc - but to do it right and to accomplish such things in a sustained manner requires <em>work</em>.  No free rides.  Yeah, of course people take chemicals and cheat and do other stupid shit to try to cheat their way through things, but you get nothing but a weak and often <em>extremely</em> detrimental chimera of what actually gets accomplished when one arrives at the goal of one&#39;s <em>own</em> accord and independent volition.</p>

<p>The only technology needed to &quot;become God&quot; is the concerted, sustained, patient, focused effort of the mind and heart/will.</p>

<p>As far as what you perhaps might be meaning when you ask your question, however (&quot;do you think that men trying to use technology to become Gods is ultimately a good thing?&quot;) well, what kind of &quot;technology&quot; exactly are you referring to that can help you &quot;become God&quot; other than what I already stated above?</p>

<p>First of all, talk of &quot;immortality&quot; is the talk of the human child.  The vast majority of humanity has absolutely <em>no</em> idea what &quot;immortality&quot; actually means or entails.  Why the <em>fuck</em> would <em>ANYBODY</em> want to be in the same God damned physical prison of a body for the rest of eternity?  What the actual fuck?  Hell, that&#39;s like actually <em>trying</em> to create the worst hell for yourself! lol  People trying to talk about or accomplish &quot;immortality&quot; are like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JmA2ClUvUY">a couple of toddlers babbling to one another about how to operate the space shuttle</a>.  They have <em>no</em> idea what the fuck they&#39;re talking about!</p>

<p>I guess this is the thing, bro.  Like I said above in my posts, I don&#39;t really have any idea what Transhumanism is in the first place.  I said what I said <em>independent</em> of Transhumanism.  What I said applies regardless of whatever Transhumanism says.</p>

<p>So <em>should</em> Transhumanism be something that people go for or not?  Hell, I don&#39;t know because, again, I don&#39;t even know what it <em>is</em>.  Explain it to me first, and then I&#39;ll respond.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I guess it depends on what it is one way or the other.  Ultimately though, and independent of Transhumanism - we human beings are generally ignorant babies...<em>very</em> ignorant babies.  There&#39;s a <em>lot</em> we don&#39;t know.  If Transhumanism can accomplish a good route toward Godhood, then great.  Go for it.  However, I don&#39;t know what exactly Transhumanism entails, and I don&#39;t think that too many of us know too much at all what Godhood really is in the first place.</p>

<p>I agree completely.  What I meant is the man-made technology that may ultimately provide humans with immortality at the cost of their humanity (this can of course be argued but, at least from my perspective, one would cease to be &quot;human&quot; in the truest sense if they were made immortal or became half human/half machine hybrids or whatever other bullshit transhumanists talk about).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no &quot;technology&quot; needed that we don&#39;t already have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, agreed.  That&#39;s kind of my whole point - the &quot;transhumanist&quot; agenda is unnatural and, I think, leads us further away from &quot;the Source&quot;, as you put it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve mentioned nothing about Gods - plural. There is no such thing actually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, agreed.  If you&#39;ll indulge me in a hypothetical for a second so that I can make my point: imagine that the &quot;elite&quot; achieve &quot;immortality&quot; in this material realm we find ourselves in.  Now we all are their immortal cattle, they our immortal masters, all of us trapped forever here in these 3-dimensions.  In that scenario, &quot;gods&quot; do indeed exist - they have <em>become</em> gods (not in the literal sense but I hope you can see what I&#39;m getting at).  That&#39;s what I meant, and that&#39;s what I see Transhumanism possibly leading to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why the fuck would ANYBODY want to be in the same God damned physical prison of a body for the rest of eternity? What the actual fuck?</p>

<p>Agreed, that&#39;s kind of my point.  Do you not see Transhumanism going in that direction (at least potentially)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, my man. So essentially we&#39;re talking about trying go to step 5,000 when we haven&#39;t even crossed step 1 yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again agreed - so what are we even talking about?  I thought you were originally supporting Transhumanism but now you seem to be saying it&#39;s completely irrelevant to our progression to the next &quot;phase&quot;, whatever form that may take.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So should Transhumanism be something that people go for or not? Hell, I don&#39;t know because, again, I don&#39;t even know what it is. Explain it to me first, and then I&#39;ll respond.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m getting at.  None of us really know what it is or what form it should/could/will take so it&#39;s tough to really speculate one way or the other.  This is why I am so wary of this apparent new &quot;transhumanist&quot; movement I&#39;ve seen crop up over the last couple years because I can see many possible outcomes (and many of them negative).  I&#39;m not sure that <em>more</em> technology, <em>more</em> AI, <em>more</em> half human/half robot cyborgs are really the answers humanity is looking for.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would say that humans should, perhaps, not tinker too much with technology that could rob them of their humanity.  That being said, I can&#39;t really think of how it could happen that humanity&#39;s &quot;humanity&quot; would get robbed by some type of technology.  I mean, there&#39;s stuff like what&#39;s been seen in <a href="http://www.oocities.org/larkspur10/neo/228/towers.jpg">science fiction movies</a>, and I&#39;m not saying that things like that can&#39;t happen, but...I can&#39;t picture how such a thing would practically, realistically come about.  I, therefore, feel that even though I would indeed agree with you that humans shouldn&#39;t tinker with technology that could rob them/us of their/our &quot;humanity&quot;...1) I&#39;m not sure exactly <em>what</em> that &quot;humanity&quot; that could be irreparably robbed specifically is.  Like...how much of a person&#39;s personality, etc can you really take before you can effectively say you&#39;ve robbed them of their humanity?  If, say, one only takes a <em>little</em> bit of it, yet achieves great things with that little that&#39;s taken, could it be said that the effort was worth it?  How about a little bit more?  How &#39;bout a little more?  At what point is it okay to do it and at what point is it <em>not</em> okay?  Also, 2) I&#39;m still not really super certain that taking one&#39;s humanity (whatever it may be) is actually even something that <em>can</em> be done in the first place - especially by another human agent.</p>

<p>All this being said, I again reiterate that I agree with you in that humans should tread very carefully when dealing with things that can have great, great effects - whatever those effects may be.  &quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one would cease to be &quot;human&quot; in the truest sense if they were made immortal or became half human/half machine hybrids</p>

<p>But...wait a minute.  It seems you equated the first half of what you said here with the second half, and those two things do not seem like they should necessarily be equated.  I would personally say that to cease to be human because one becomes immortal is <em>significantly</em> better than ceasing to be human because one becomes a half human/half machine hybrid.</p>

<p>...and, for that matter, I guess it also depends upon what one exactly means by &quot;machine&quot;.  If you really think about it, we&#39;re <em>already</em> machines.  We&#39;re &quot;biological organism&quot; machines. Technology can eventually increase to become so integrated with biological matter that the &quot;machines&quot; that are created can be practically indistinguishable from biological organisms.</p>

<p>I&#39;m realizing that what I just said here might sound like I&#39;m suddenly favoring Transhumanism (or what I understand of it), but I wouldn&#39;t want you to get that impression.  I still think it very ill-advised for humanity to tinker too quickly with technology that it may not understand.  However, as much as I fully understand that deep black project technology is likely 50-150 plus years more advanced than anything that exists in the civilian sector, I&#39;m not quite sure that humanity has gotten too close to - let alone mastered - the art of ensoulment...and I&#39;m not sure anything much that relates to some of these topics we&#39;re talking about here would work without being able to understand that aspect of the dynamic first.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the &quot;transhumanist&quot; agenda is unnatural and, I think, leads us further away from &quot;the Source&quot;, as you put it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the risk of commenting upon something I&#39;m admitting I&#39;m not very versed in (i.e. Transhumanism), I think I might agree with your above statement here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>imagine that the &quot;elite&quot; achieve &quot;immortality&quot; in this material realm we find ourselves in. Now we all are their immortal cattle, they our immortal masters, all of us trapped forever here in these 3-dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But...that simply couldn&#39;t happen...or at least seems unlikely/untennable to the <em>Nth</em> degree.  We have to at least make an attempt to really understand the practicalities of the hypotheticals we propose in order to properly assess if those things actually even COULD happen in the first place.  Essentially you&#39;re talking about a hypothetical scenario where &quot;they&quot; live forever and have...kind of forced/trapped us into being able to live forever so that we would keep being their slaves?</p>

<p>I mean...if that were the case, then what on Earth would be stopping me or anybody from simply killing themselves?  The BODY isn&#39;t immortal.  I mean I cut off my own head, or I shove myself through an industrial sized cattle meat grinder that turns me into soup and I&#39;m <em>dead</em>.  I turn myself into soup and I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t be immortal any longer then would I?  They can&#39;t put Humpty Dumpty back together again after he&#39;s a pack of mushy sausage can they?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see how what you&#39;re saying can actually happen is I guess what I&#39;m getting at.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In that scenario, &quot;gods&quot; do indeed exist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, that&#39;s the thing.  One, that scenario likely couldn&#39;t really <em>actually</em> happen.  And even if it actually COULD happen where TPTB became immortal slave owners and turned the 99% into immortal slaves?...No, man.  Just no.  That just simply couldn&#39;t and <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> work.  You see, we are all of us individual, very ephemeral, infinitesimally tiny drops in the One Eternal Ocean.  As a tiny, ephemeral drop, you come and you go.  Some of those drops think they&#39;re bigger and more important than others.  Doesn&#39;t matter though.  They&#39;re all drops...The Ocean is what&#39;s real...is what&#39;s eternal.  Once that Ocean/God decides It doesn&#39;t want to keep playing Its little game of being a little, temporary drop, then It will simply stop...and that tiny drop - whether it&#39;s a poor beggar drop or a world-conquering king drop, an elite or a serf - will simply stop being a tiny drop, will reabsorb into The One Ocean, and will realize that it was just God playing a little game all along.</p>

<p>Taken from this perspective, what you&#39;re saying about the elite on this planet becoming immortal masters to immortal slaves just doesn&#39;t make any sense/doesn&#39;t compute to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they have become gods (not in the literal sense but I hope you can see what I&#39;m getting at). That&#39;s what I meant, and that&#39;s what I see Transhumanism possibly leading to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that version of &quot;god&quot; that they&#39;ve become is nothing but a little drop of water that&#39;s simply become just a <em>little</em> bit bigger and that lasts just a <em>little</em> bit longer than the other drops.  That&#39;s it.  After a while, that tiny little drop that temporarily liked to call and fancy itself &quot;immortal!&quot; will dry up and go right back into The One Ocean made up of all the other little drops laughing at its little game.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick random/perhaps not so random fact:  Frank Drake (of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">The Drake Equation</a> fame) estimated that there are likely about 10,000 civilizations in this the Milky Way galaxy <em>alone</em>.  Current science estimates that there are approximately 176 <em>billion</em> galaxies in the known universe (B not M) - the Milky Way galaxy being a decidedly average member amongst the multitude.</p>

<p>...That&#39;s one hundred and seventy six <em>QUADRILLION</em> civilizations estimated to exist in the known universe by our current, <em>extremely</em> limited version of science, my brother.  176,000,000,000,000,000.  That&#39;s 176 with fifteen zeros after it.</p>

<p>We human beings...are babes.  Tiny babes.  We don&#39;t know what we&#39;re <em>talking</em> about when we entertain ideas about &quot;immortality&quot;.  There is NOTHING on this planet that can keep us or hold us down forever, my man.  Nothing.  We are part of the very stars that make up our galaxy and beyond.  That little feeble bag of skin and bones you see every day in front of the mirror is but the <em>tiniest</em> speck of who You <em>really</em> are.</p>

<p>A bunch of elites enslaving that tiny bag of skin and bones for &quot;eternity&quot; is absolutely NOTHING we <em>ever</em> have to worry about.</p>

<p>Transhumanism turning into what you outlined above is like...is like...hell I don&#39;t even have an example for it...It just won&#39;t happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the fuck would ANYBODY want to be in the same God damned physical prison of a body for the rest of eternity? What the actual fuck?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, that&#39;s kind of my point. Do you not see Transhumanism going in that direction (at least potentially)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t know enough about it to make such an assertion one way or the other.  Even if Transhumanism were going after such a thing as immortality though, it would simply miserably, miserably fail...so badly that I don&#39;t think one has to lose too much sleep worrying about the possibility of their succeeding.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, my man. So essentially we&#39;re talking about trying go to step 5,000 when we haven&#39;t even crossed step 1 yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again agreed - so what are we even talking about? I thought you were originally supporting Transhumanism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  Helll no!  lol.  What ever gave you that idea?  I&#39;m not supporting it, but I&#39;m not outright negating it either - as I don&#39;t know enough about it one way or the other.  I <em>can</em> say that, as mentioned above, if Transhumanism is attempting to achieve immortality in this physical human garb, it is not only laughably ill-advised, but woefully, woefully ignorant to boot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but now you seem to be saying it&#39;s completely irrelevant to our progression to the next &quot;phase&quot;, whatever form that may take.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s irrelevant in the sense that we&#39;re all eventually going to the same place sooner or later.  It&#39;s not irrelevant with regard to the path one might want to take to get there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure that more technology, more AI, more half human/half robot cyborgs are really the answers humanity is looking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re certainly not if human <em>wisdom</em> is not also increased.  If human wisdom is not increased, then it doesn&#39;t matter <em>what</em> kind of technology exists.  We will use it all to ultimately destroy ourselves.</p>

<p>If we <em>do</em> increase and develop and evolve in our wisdom, however, then we won&#39;t even need such technology and trinkets and do dads in the first place.</p>

<p>That&#39;s good to know, as I haven&#39;t found too many other people that tell me they share those perspectives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess where we differ is that I am more staunchly against the transhumanist agenda than you are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it does seem that way.  I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m directly against it one way or the other, and in that, you might be correct in what you just stated as a difference between us.  It&#39;s certainly not an incompatible difference, but, again, I wouldn&#39;t disagree with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I, too, am no expert on it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  You know, perhaps a good portion of why it seems that I&#39;m not so against it is because, again, I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m all TOO familiar with it.  I mean I think it&#39;s not a bad idea for a species to try to improve and better itself for sure.  It seems Transhumanism is one attempt or interpretation on &quot;humanity bettering itself&quot;.  As such, I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s &quot;all&quot; bad...but yeah.  From the little we&#39;ve talked about it here, it does seem to have quite a few significant holes in its theory.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with the possibility of Transhumanism going awry, but I guess the thing is that a LOT of different things and theories can actually go awry if they&#39;re simply not handled properly.  Transhumanism is one of them, but it&#39;s definitely not alone or unique in being a philosophy that can be used for great ill if found in the wrong hands.  Such is <em>already</em> the case with many things on this planet, unfortunately.  If in the RIGHT hands, however, I can&#39;t say that a Transhumanist philosophy couldn&#39;t be used for good.  This, of course, is the case with almost anything though:  When in the right hands and in right use, many things can end up being beneficial.  In the wrong hands, almost anything can end up not so good.</p>

<p>I guess, perhaps then, a good crux of what you&#39;re saying may involve not the mechanism itself, but the <em>user</em> - he/she who <em>uses</em> the mechanism (in this case Transhumanism).</p>

<p>In other words, perhaps it can ultimately be said that humans may simply not be ready right now for the power that Transhumanism can bring.</p>

<p>Transhumanism doesn&#39;t seem like a bad thing if it helps improve humanity and help it become better...but whether it does or doesn&#39;t depends upon how it&#39;s used...and I&#39;m not sure if humans know how to use such a thing as Transhumanism responsibly at this point.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that at all.  However, I&#39;m not super sure that we aren&#39;t <em>already</em> a type of slave experiencing a holographic projection we call &quot;reality&quot;.  That&#39;s a topic for another discussion though...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh I don&#39;t disagree with that at all.  I fully agree that doing something like that is foolhardy and can likely lead to very NOT good results.  I&#39;m certainly not advocating for anything like that.  I&#39;m just saying we shouldn&#39;t allow ourselves to get too, too consternated over the possibility that others might be thinking or planning on such a level as you described because in the end, the beings planning like that will likely ultimately not go very far anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s possibly that my perception of &quot;reality&quot;, even as &quot;real&quot; as it seems to me, is <em>completely</em> off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  I personally feel that&#39;s a good perspective to have, and one which I second.  I am generally confident about a lot of the things I feel and think, but I also know that I could be <em>completely</em> wrong in what I&#39;m seeing, thinking, and feeling.  Oh well.  It seems you can generally only go on what you know...or <em>think</em>  you know anyway.</p>
