    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t know. i would ask him how he thought it was sensible to explain controlled demolition of wtc1 and wtc2 with freaking rigid <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFVoencqfZw">cardboard boxes</a> (yeah, i know it&#39;s a video poking fun but also the first one that popped up on the youtube search). i don&#39;t even want to get into the whole freefall or not debate but the fact that he did this is baffling as it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the matters at hand. </p>

<p>(it doesn&#39;t matter if there was one storey or 2000 beneath the collapsing top segment and the actio=reactio reasoning doesn&#39;t apply on this scale as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWjRiCbvSE">videos like this</a> show in principle.)</p>

<p>the &quot;technical&quot; papers regarding the collapse on ae911thruth.org he invites us to check out also <a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200703/Sudden_collapse_initiation_impossible.pdf">come woefully short</a>. there&#39;s not a single physical equation or anything that resembles academic research there. </p>

<p>the whole ae911truth thing and assorted initiatives must have collected some money over time and they <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/blueprints.html">have the blueprints</a>. why aren&#39;t they doing the math themselves and conduct a simulation with data and parameters open to critique, i.e. available to the public - unlike the NIST simulations? with a simulation like this it should be easy to show that the storeys of the lower part of the wtc&#39;s were stable enough to slow down the collapse a considerable amount or even stable enough to halt the collapse and just have the top segment toppling over or desintegrating.</p>

<p>where are these studies?</p>

<p>would questions like this count as &#39;derailing&#39;? </p>

<p>its structural integrity was weakened to the point that the top floors fell down on the building below. buildings are not billard balls. they have the data and they have the resources, both in brain power and money. even if money is short, thousands of engineers could at least put together a simulation. richard gage himself gets a 75.000 salary from his nonprofit. so why not invest some time into something that would actually provide some interesting and peer-reviewable insight into the impossibility of the &#39;official conspiray theory&#39; and one-up NIST in terms of openness  and transparency instead of doing the rounds presenting the same circumstantial stuff as gage does?</p>

<p>That&#39;s cute that you would call NIST&#39;s little cartoon a &quot;simulation&quot;. A simulation is one that mimics reality and can be validated with data through access to the parameters. Can&#39;t do that with them, because &quot;it&#39;s a threat to national security&quot;. So don&#39;t cast the first stone. </p>

<p>Pull up any simulation on high-rise testing and you would find an example of a good simulation. Besides that, there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that they are working towards a collective paper of their own. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not part of it to tell you how far it has progressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I have already seen examples of how buildings behave in real life, buddy. </p>

<p>Buildings (even those that aren&#39;t steel-framed) behave as a single unit. Have ALWAYS done so. So you&#39;re committing a grave mistake to ask me for precedents, because I can throw them at you all day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsKxVTf4YYM">Here</a></p>

<p>Granted, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XMTALBYRNA">here&#39;s</a> one collapsing due to fire, but it&#39;s a <strong>partial collapse</strong>, towards the weakest point of resistance, which is what Gage has been telling you all along. And not at free-fall. (You could even see the top of the building still standing after the smoke clears). </p>

<p>Even if you had no trusses between the columns, and literally <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY5NVkGtZ0Y">paper-light material</a>, it&#39;s not supposed to fall with free-fall acceleration, as demonstrated in the video. Neither is the chain reaction instantaneous as NIST demonstrates. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDuUR7l3bgc&amp;amp;t=1m30s">Here&#39;s</a> another example of a crumbling structure, even without steel reinforcement. It collapses at snail-pace. Why? Because <strong>resistance</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, then let&#39;s hope that the independent simulation and/or paper that deals specifically with the collapse of the wtc you hope is in the works will clear up our disagreement (if mr. gage doesn&#39;t burn the ae911truth money on his salary and travel expenses).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>if that were the case the top segment of the building would have just bounced off the lower part in the video i posted and statics engineers would be jobless. if a car would run into a house the structure would just absorb the shock or maybe move slightly. </p>

<p>&#39;precedent&#39; is a meaningless term outside of the legal world (maybe historians use it, too, to demonstrate a paradigm shift of one kind or other). why would engineers need to simulate a particular bridge when history has shown that another one, even incorporating the same design principle, didn&#39;t collapse?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because resistance.</p>

<p>then the aetruth engineers should have no problem showing that the resistance of the lower building part was enough to slow down the collapse significantly. without any wtc specific work any further speculation is meaningless.</p>

<p>Woooooow . You did not just say that. </p>

<p>You need a lesson on the scientific method. I&#39;d say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science">this wiki entry</a> on the philosophy of science should be sufficient, to not overwhelm you. </p>

<p>What you really need to do in the long run is go back and read up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a> then work your way up from there if you really want to sift through reality, and make a good judgement on the difference between truth and fiction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the term &#39;precedent&#39; doesn&#39;t show up in both articles. it sure as hell doesn&#39;t show up in statics. so, care to enlighten me on its relevance? as i said, i read it in historic articles when people talk about a new phenomenon that introduces a new era in one respect or another like &quot;the heavy use of longbowmen in western warfare is without precedent&quot;. philosophers (or rather philosophy historians) use it, too, sometimes when describing the introduction of a new concept. i have never seen it outside articles that weren&#39;t historical in nature.</p>

<p>If you mean by mathematics, then that&#39;s not how physics works.

<p>The computer simulation works as a piece of paper, but with graphics. If I multiply the mass of construction-steel with a billion, it will give me a simulation, but it will not be a realistic parameter that mirrors reality. This is why it&#39;s so important to have access to NIST&#39;s model, which is not granted. </p>

<p>So we&#39;re left with a piece of paper with a bunch of symbols we don&#39;t know the meaning of. This is not physics. </p>

<p>mathematics is &quot;just&quot; the language in which physics problems and structures are formulated. of course a particular simulation has to incorporate state-of-the-art physics knowledge and principles, otherwise it would just be an animation, an exercise in futility. a steel frame building not collapsing due to an office fire is a way to broad and unprecise &#39;precedent&#39; to be considered a physical and &#39;hard natural sciences&#39; phenomenon. to be that, a building identical to the wtc would have to be rammed by a jet identical to the jets used on 9/11 and <em>not</em> collapse. because that is not possible a simulation that contains every known parameter is the next best thing.</p>

<p>I just told you that the simulations have to represent reality or they&#39;re worthless. You&#39;re even agreeing with me. Why would you need a computer simulation of an apple falling instead of watching an apple fall with your own eyes? Building 7 consisted of 47 floors and 81 steel columns. It was an engineering marvel. For it to collapse due to fires is fantastical.</p>

<p>But I still agree with you that they should give us a computer model of the whole ordeal, maybe just to satisfy people like you. Guess what though, it wont be very dramatic. It will only show a building on fire for hours or days until all the carbon based fuel burns out, and the structure remains standing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>... a building collapsing is a very complex process that incorporates many basic physical phenomena.</p>

<p>Oh, you mean like the <em>conservation of energy</em> for both the fires and the collapse; the <em>conservation of momentum</em> for the collapse; the <em>tensile strength</em> of steel and concrete; the <em>heat resistance</em> of materials; the <em>heat transfer</em> for steel and concrete; and much more. These are all examples from the top of my head, that were ALL violated on that day, and not explained sufficiently by NIST. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s pretty simple. No high rise buildings had fallen due to fires before then (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the examples), but three skyscrapers fell on the same day. This is not &quot;granular&quot; or an &quot;exercise in futility&quot;. This is empiricism. If there&#39;s an anomaly, it needs to be explained, and if there are three on the same day, then boy do you have some explaining to do. </p>

<p>i guess we have to agree to disagree here. i, for one, am waiting for something tangible from the truth movement. the only thing superficially resembling anything of a scientific analysis was the flawed study on &#39;superthermite&#39; which doesn&#39;t want to release samples for inspection by other researchers, essentially making their results irreproducable, and which was methodically flawed in other respects.</p>

<p>i&#39;d like to see some hard physics on this by the truth movement (which of course includes mathematics) that incorporate the physical properties you mentioned. i&#39;ve seen graphs of the acceleration of the collapse that totally misunderstand the underlying physical principles and videos posted here as irrefutable proof that could be refuted by a junior high schooler.

<p>because engineering is not that simple and what is ultimately a gut feeling is not enough to convince me. also, you&#39;re comparing an apple and a highly complex structure, making the same mistake as mr gage with his cardboard boxes. highrisebuilding != highrisebuilding and fire != fire. venture into any profession and see how matters that seem simple and comparatively similar become very complex and differentiated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to butt in this conversation, appoligies to you and to the 2nd party if this isn&#39;t welcomed or it&#39;s already been addressed.</p>

<p>The main problem with NIST&#39;s model is that it claims something that is impossible to happen: global collapse of a high rise steel building. A claim of this magnitude would have serious consequences on the 101 structural engineering and fire&amp;health security planning, as in; any similar structure would be halted immediatly until the fire&amp;health protection planning commitees (or whatever their name is) established the updated protocols on building construction to avoid said &quot;accident&quot; from happening again.</p>

<p>Nothing like this has happened, in fact it was also completely ignored when the new wtc tower was built with the exactly same structural pattern as the previous two: <a href="http://architecture.about.com/od/worldtradecenter/ig/World-Trade-Center-Plans/Ground-Floor-Plan.htm">open space floors with outbound and central cored columns</a>, which - <em>according to 911</em> - is a structural building prone to collapse when it catches fire.</p>

<p>So we don&#39;t have any change to the construction fire protocols - <em>nothing was halted, nothing was changed</em> -, we have the new tower using the same construction pattern as the previous ones - <em>which are supposedly a serious fire&amp;collapse hazard</em> - and we have NIST claiming the impossible and refusing the public to confirm said claim by locking the data for their research in a &quot;national security concerns&quot; excuse - <em>data pertaining buildings that no longer exist and in essence only exibit in more detail what the NIST report already explained</em>.</p>

<p>Following the above, and knowing that people still believe in NIST for some ilogical reason, how could we - <em>the ones that do not believe in the official version</em> - provide a true model simulation that would change your views? How could we show you anything and not be target of deniability because we are the ones that did it and using that as an excuse because we did it wrong?</p>

<p>It falls in the same category of the debunkers asking the conspiracies to provide them with witnesses and when they do the debunkers simply say &quot;useless, that person is crazy. bring someone else&quot; knowing fully well that no matter whoever we bring, that person will always be rejected.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t being reasonable.</p>

<p>thousands of engineers are on &#39;your&#39; side. allegedly the laws of physics are, too ;) a simulation à la nist that actually releases their data and underlying models and that convincingly proves that a collapse of the wtc could not happen because of fires and structural damage alone would go a long way. at least for me, i suppose. i agree that it would be a clusterfuck of accusations of inaccuracies and ommission, though. anything including actual calculations from the side of the truth movement that&#39;s available to date is pretty amateurish, though, and actual engineering work from the aetruth engineers would be nice to see. </p>

<p>not really. eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable and i&#39;ve yet to come across an eyewitness report that&#39;s convincing. some truther sources use truncated statements etc. afair the guys who interviewed people on the pentagon incident interviewed a lot people but only included the statements of a handful into their report. not the same category at all. </p>

<p>yeah, it probably should have. but especially in the u.s. corporate interests rule supreme and maybe the &#39;security concerns&#39; or &#39;national interests&#39; NIST claims as reason for not releasing their data are actually interests of the construction lobby facing boatloads of losses.</p>

<p>somewhere in this whole noise of facts, factoids and interpretations is a conspiracy. i&#39;m just not convinced that the &#39;fly planes into buildings and then blow them up with detonation devices clandestinely planted before&#39; is it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, I understand better your position now. You are skeptic but not as far as to consider what we defend as the conspiracy theory, though also not as far as to reject the official version entirely.</p>

<p>And returning to the aspect of aeengs releasing their own model not being a target for labeling rejection, let&#39;s not forget that there was a man that defended WTC7 free-fall speeds for quite some time and every debunker denied it being true and labeled him as a tactic to descredit. However, later the NIST report was <em>corrected</em> as to support what the man easily pointed out by a simple visual program calculation. Only then the debunkers agreed that the building did in fact achieve free-fall speeds but only when NIST said so, not before.</p>

<p>If the aeengs would release their model the same thing would happen, however I hardly doubt NIST would reach the point of admitting it, instead we would go years after years of rejection by the debunkers just like when it was with free-fall and the work and money spent on creating a true model simulation would be ignored and a pure waste of time.</p>

<p>One thing would be to have this publicly &quot;If there is a model simulation with the real values available that prove the fires wouldn&#39;t cause the collapse we will start a completely new investigation&quot;, another thing is &quot;why don&#39;t you show us your model then? why won&#39;t you spend lots of money and lots of time for something that we will most likely completely reject?&quot;.</p>

<p>Another problem with NIST&#39;s report is that they didn&#39;t explain why did the buildings suffer global collapse, and not just partial collapse. Correction, they did explain, they said it was &quot;inevitable&quot;. That&#39;s it. They were paid $20M for collapse cause explanation and global collapse explanation and all they could say for the $10M request was &quot;inevitable&quot;. I don&#39;t know about you but if I was the one spending that kind of money for 2 questions I would have a big problem if one of them was answered like that.</p>

<p>And thus I recall yet another problem with the report but this one will be discussed in another fashion. The topic of the free-fall claim by NIST.</p>

<p>Hope you understand that this isn&#39;t a discussion in which I am invested in making you think differently nor hoping that you do the same to me, is just an exchange of ideas between you and me.</p>

<p>This information is incorrect. Truthers claimed for years that WTC7 fell at freefall speeds during the entire collapse and staunchly supported their belief by declaring anyone that disagreed with this opinion to be a shill. Some still believe this to be the case. </p>

<p>However, <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf">In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008</a>, NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. </p>

<p>From NIST&#39;s Q&amp;A:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).</li>
<li>Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)</li>
<li>Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity</li>
</ul>

<p>This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Butwhen NIST reported this, &quot;truthers&quot; everywhere couldn&#39;t wait to fall all over themselves screaming, <em>&quot;NIST CONFIRMS FREEFALL! NIST CONFIRMS FREEFALLLLL! We were right all along guise!!!!!&quot;</em></p>

<p>And even now, you are defending a point using an observational selection fallacy.</p>

<p>If &quot;truthers&quot; are going to be taken at all seriously, they need to make sure that their information is correct and not resort to half-truths or conjecture disguised as fact to cloud or confuse the issue. </p>

<p>BTW, I&#39;m not sure what &quot;AEENGS&quot; means that you keep referring to. Can you clue us in?</p>

<p>It is an expected reaction seen that we were called crazy, liars, and all sorts of labels because we were saying something that they knew to be impossible and when NIST itself proved us right we still kept being treated the same way because the debunkers put pride over common sense when it comes to 911 discussions.</p>

<p>I do not understand the need for you to be attacking this discussion in this form when all I am doing here is to exchange ideas, not trying to change anyone&#39;s minds. The person that I was talking to understood perfectly well what the aeengs meant; ae911truth engineers - ae engs - aeengs. This is completely uncalled for.</p>

<p>I will try to be more clear about the problem of NIST&#39;s conceding the free-fall that occured.</p>

<p>You said, and very correctly, that NIST declared that the building did fall at free-fall speeds but only partially and only for <del>18 stories</del> a few stories. The time period that they studied was - <em>from the moment of the collapse to the moment that the building is no longer visible</em> - 5.4s for a total of 18 stories.</p>

<p>5.4s, like you pointed out accurately, is 40% longer descent time than a complete free-fall. For it to be complete free-fall it would have to be 3.9s.</p>

<p>Even when I ignore that multiple demolitions also don&#39;t fall at free-fall speeds all the time, there is a big problem when you check NIST&#39;s study with the video evidence that they used and the model simulations.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you study yourself the 5.4s in the video evidence you will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXTlaqXsm4k">see that the time is too far fetched behind the true moment of when the north-face starts descending.</a> This means that NIST used an artificial start time of the collapse of the north face that did not exist.</p></li>
<li><p>The 3 stage descent of the building is not at all a <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kPL-0z6nFSo/TAqytAFvyXI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/purtRjN0NIM/s1600/WTC7+NIST+admits+freefall.png"><em>smooth line</em></a> compatible with their findings, <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kPL-0z6nFSo/TApeTrTu4cI/AAAAAAAAAII/jyBBLi8rA2w/s1600/WTC7-VideoAnalysis.jpg">it is simply a sudden/abrupt descent into free-fall.</a> There is no &quot;smooth acceleration&quot; on the start of the descent.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, NIST dry labbed their study on this aspect as an attempt to make it &quot;fit&quot; their findings, however of findings they had none but the one that truthers already said countless times: That the building fell at free-fall speeds from start to end of the visible descent.</p>

<p>NIST changed their descent time range in order to fit in the 40% extra time and declare it as a not a complete free-fall collapse. You take the fictitious stage1 out of the equation and you have a complete free-fall collapse.</p>

<p>Again, I am not here to change your mind or anything, I simply corrected your observations with proper observations to avoid the fallacy that you commit: Repeat NIST&#39;s word without checking their work in the first place.</p>

<p>thank god. the moving of goalposts and intentional misunderstanding to gain an advantage here is really grating and exhausting.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve seen graphs of the acceleration of the collapse that totally misunderstand the underlying physical principles and videos posted here as irrefutable proof that could be refuted by a junior high schooler.</p>

<p>What? The free-fall acceleration can be refuted by a junior high schooler? Please do that for me. Take your time and come back tomorrow if you want. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>because engineering is not that simple and what is ultimately a gut feeling is not enough to convince me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It actually <strong>is</strong> simple, and I&#39;m sorry that you have suppressed your instincts to fit the official narrative in your mind. What keeps the <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/images/rubber_duck_water_crop_450.jpg">rubber duck</a> afloat is the same phenomenon as with the <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ioQL150eOEw/TwKrxrPAzwI/AAAAAAAAAKU/wUkugg_Cq_A/w800-h800/ocean-cargo-container-ship.jpg">cargo ship</a>. There is a reason why we say that Archimedes made his discovery in a bathtub, and Isaac Newton with the falling apple. The mechanical laws are universally applicable (unless you have to incorporate general relativity). </p>

<p>In our case, the mass of a falling object is either always working linearly, or it&#39;s not taken into account at all. </p>

<p>Free fall ignores mass completely: </p>

<pre><code>y(t) = -1/(2gt^2 ) + v(0)t + y(0)
</code></pre>

<p>The relationship between potential and kinetic energy has a linear relationship for mass:</p>

<pre><code>E(k) = (1/2) m v^2
E(p) = m g h
</code></pre>

<p>Even gravity has a linear relationship between two objects with mass. (When one of them is earth in both cases).</p>

<pre><code>F = (G m(1)m(2)) / r^2 
</code></pre>

<p>You see that the energy increases with the square of the velocity in the kinetic equation, but mass is still linear, meaning the behavior of a larger mass isn&#39;t amplified outside of what you would expect from a smaller model. This is what I believe those who adhere to the official story misinterpret. </p>

<p>In other words, use the apple, or a Jenga tower. It&#39;s just as valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree.</p>

<p>I think vibrant and cogent discourse in the public forum can dispel malfeasance and uphold the dignity of the human person in a lawmaking arenas saturated with payola. </p>

<p>That is what civic republicanism is all about. Jefferson&#39;s flame burns eternally in this country so long as there are those benevolent Bernaysian who are willing to attack the vacuity with informed, albeit short, forays into the public sphere. The role of the public intellectual is no doubt changing, but that does not mean we must give up on the project of liberalism as found in the ideals of the original enlightenment. Such an approach is foolhardy and an insult to the intellectual legacy of the ideas you so brashly cast aside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like that idea but i want someone with solid foundations to come here with in depth political knowledge, someone with in depth knowledge of geo-political strategy and war, someone who can shed some light on financial malpractice and fraud, someone who has worked in drug trafficking and who has knowledge of the CIA, etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want stories about UFO&#39;s and interesting calls to a radio show as much as that would be interesting. We need really solid guests here so we can have a proper and serious discussion where we can gain some real insight into obtainable and credible information. </p>

<p>How about Jeremy Scahill for example?</p>

<p>This guys the real deal and won&#39;t hold back on discussions. There&#39;s so many avenues of discussion with this guest. Drones, Al Qaeda, JSOC, Bin Laden, US geo-political strategy, covert ops, future war and strategy, Obamas increase in covert operations etc.</p>

<p>Another suggestion, former CIA and activist, Ray McGovern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t get much of a response from John Hutchison but his wife Nancy seems to be his spokes person</p>

<p>Or you possibly could speak to the Nuclear sub Captain who has been impacted by their &quot; experiments&quot; since his property is right next door. The &quot; tones&quot; from their &quot; experiment&quot; with their &quot; ray gun&quot; have involved him with a fight over zoning which has engaged them and the local town administrators. The &quot; Captain&quot; has quite a sense of humor ( in not so much a laughing matter) and he has &quot; boots on the ground experience&quot; dealing with the Hutchisons which might be an engaging AMA sideline, if you could get him to do it. I can contact him if you decide to go in that direction. He is also a physicist besides being the Captain of two nuclear subs. I think his observations of what the Hutchisons are saying they are doing are valid.</p>

The thing that does worry is Dr. Wood linking her name with what is called the &quot;Hutchison Effect&quot; and her statements that she has made regarding that. </p>

<p>Going into that direction  is bound to dump you into the deepest rabbit hole you have ever known. I have spent the last couple of months trying to communicate with John Hutchison and his wife Nancy. I am not sure I could recommend the experience. Also not sure that  its worth the fall into that particular rabbit hole.... but it might be interesting to some of you with the fortitude to handle it. </p>

But anything that she has to say about something else bringing those towers down is going to be very well hidden by the G-dawfull image of a seemingly deranged man prancing about in a bright red silk Teddy..... and anyone even somewhat associated with him is dragged down by the disinformation artists that frequent his site and career. And there are a slew of them.</p>

<p>But have you ever wondered why the act on his part? Why things have been so easy to discount when some very intelligent men like Col. Alexander and his companions at Los Alamos have admitted to looking at it carefully. Are you going to believe all of them so easily that you automatically brand her... some one who is only interested in attention whoring? Perhaps it might be worth trying to look underneath that level.</p>

<p>Just my opinion folks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of shit the government knows / has about material interactions, particularly in weaponized forms, that they don&#39;t let out. But Hutchison can&#39;t repeat his own shit when &quot;outsiders&quot; are around. </p>

<p>Wood has claims about using and controlling a hurricane as part of the weapon. Let&#39;s apply Occam&#39;s razor to that one: Planes into buildings + demo charges vs a satellite based energy weapon that needs a static field so large only a human manipulated hurricane can produce it. Personally I&#39;ll go with the former. Is there a one in a billion chance the latter is true? Sure, but until that&#39;s proven otherwise I&#39;ll stick with my gut.</p>

<p>(also I don&#39;t know why people are down-voting you, you haven&#39;t said anything crazy or dishonest)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still would like to know why Col. John Alexander took such a great interest in Johns work and then quietly faded to the background. Did he discount him completely or was there something else going on?</p>

<p>Oh he would be a good one to ask for an AMA, being involved with remote viewing programs as he has been. Interesting stuff and somehow involved in UFO and advanced propulsion also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I missed attending a recent UFO conference in Arizona which had him being a major speaker last weekend. I had a whole slewful of questions that I wanted to ask him. So he may be open to this kind of request.
Perhaps he would be a better AMA than Wood, I agree but maybe just because he has had a longterm relationship with the fellows at Los Alamos and there seems to still be a strong connection. I understand he is sort of a no nonsense type. Questions to him might be revealing.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been shadowbanned by the reddit admins, but I have approved your comment anyway.</p>

<p>As to your statement; Jones has former startfor on staff. That&#39;s enough for me. Also, Bill Cooper exposed Mr. Jones for what he is. </p>
