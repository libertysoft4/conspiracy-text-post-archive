    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re trying to to say, but I have to take offense to it. If I could make it a rule that no one could ever mention reptiles again, I would, but that would break the rules we already have.</p>

<p>Every time someone just <em>hints</em> at the word reptile, it makes us all look bad. It has become codeword for &quot;those of us who have gone way too far over the edge&quot;, and the public knows this. One of the biggest PR hits we&#39;ve had in the past year was simply Louis CK going on Opie and Anthony, and saying &quot;People believe Rumsfeld is a lizard man&quot;. </p>

<p>I know all of that didn&#39;t really have to deal with what you&#39;re talking about, but &quot;lizard men believers&quot; is like the &quot;nigger&quot; of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It&#39;s a derogatory reference that doesn&#39;t really get any point across.</p>

<p>THAT BEING SAID: I did mention that Occam&#39;s Razor was <em>useful</em>, however it is not really a tool for finding the truth. It is merely a tool to figure out which probability to bet on in the absence of conclusive evidence. Occam&#39;s Razor is not some law of physics, nor is it even a complete rule for logic. It is about likelihood, not fact. </p>

<p>Use it only as an investigative tool, not a divining rod. </p>

<p>I only mentioned the reptilian thing because the use of it tends to be almost slanderous against this community. &quot;Oh, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>...you mean the folks who believe in lizard people?&quot;.

<p>The way I respond is to always stay completely focused on government documents. You can argue all day with someone over &quot;science&quot; when it comes what temperature steel beams melt and how fast buildings fall. So just point out the lies in the report. 503 firefighters were forcibly denied their opportunity to have their eyewitness testimony included in the history of this nation (legally, government workers like firefighters are considered &quot;expert testimony&quot; in the court of law). That&#39;s a blatant lie of omission. And what does Occam&#39;s Razor say when applied to lies? It&#39;s usually that someone is trying to hide something.</p>

<p>When someone brings up Occam&#39;s Razor as it applies to 911, remind them that it&#39;s not about the simple explanation as to what happened. It&#39;s about the way this crime was investigated and recorded in history. It&#39;s about legal justice and truth in the history books. As it stands, the version of history our children will be taught in school is a blatant lie. </p>

If they were to have shrugged their shoulders and concluded that the building was safe because no building ever fell down because of fire alone (even though they wouldn&#39;t have known that NIST would conclude fire was the cause six years later) and then the building fell they would have gotten people killed.</p>

<p>The firefighters were looking at a building with a huge gash down the side, and was burning like crazy all down the south side, and they were hearing bangs (not explosions) as parts of the structure was failing.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t, especially when the buildings are different types of construction, different sizes, and had different things happen to them.</p>

<p>Hence the contrast, rather than comparison:  one fell down and the other one didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you really felt for the trick of name dropping scientific sounding methods applied to irrelevant and non-related fields to impress people who did never heard of said methods? By definition Occams Razor is a rule of thumb that should only be applied to natural sciences (chemistry, biology and physics). The reasoning behind it is that Mother Nature optimized processes and does not waste energy and this means that the most straight forward and most simple explanation is something Mother Nature would come up. Therefore simple explanations are more likely. And still it is never used to proof a theory or to eliminate all other options.</p>

<p>With other words Occams Razor does not suggest non natural causes or human interventions to be more likely if they are the most common or most simple opinions or theories. Given that you did not interpret the definition of Occams Razor right there is no basis for your claim in your last sentence.</p>

<p>By whose &quot;definition,&quot; exactly? I guess that rules out its use in, oh, religion, say. Must come as a surprise to the Franciscan friar and theologian, William of Ockham, after whom it&#39;s named. Or the others in the same field who used it before him, such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus.</p>

<p>The reality: it can actually be used in any field where you have data, hypotheses and assumptions. Which certainly includes 9/11. </p>

<p>and in the case of 911 something &quot;unprecedented&quot; thats never happened to a steel building before happened not once, not twice, but THREE times in one day. tower 1&amp;2 fell because of 2 planes crashing and jet fuel, ok. but wtc7 no plane crash,no jet fuel(because thats how tower1&amp;2 fell because of the extreme heat of jet fuel weakened the beams ok) so how did the temp get hot enough to weaking the steel beams on wtc7? </p>

<p>&quot;Early on, we saw a <strong>bulge</strong> in the southwest corner between floors 10 and 13, and we had put a transit on that and we were pretty sure she was going to collapse. <strong>You actually could see there was a visible bulge, it ran up about three floors</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At this point, 7, which is right there on Vesey, the whole corner of the building was missing. I was thinking to myself we are in a bad place, because it was the corner facing us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And just around we were about a hundred yards away and Butch Brandeis came running up. He said <strong>forget it, nobody’s going into 7, there’s creaking, there are noises coming out of there</strong>, so we just stopped. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was looking at WTC-7 and I noticed that <strong>it wasn&#39;t looking straight. It was really weird. The closest corner to me (SE corner) was kind of out of whack with the SW corner</strong>. It was impossible to tell whether the corner (SW) was leaning over more or even if it was leaning the other way. . . . <strong>I&#39;m sure I could see the building was leaning over in a way it certainly should not be</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was the first time really my stomach tightened up because <strong>the building didn’t look good</strong>. I was figuring probably the standpipe systems were shot. There was no hydrant pressure. I wasn’t really keen on the idea. Then this other officer I’m standing next to said, <strong>that building doesn’t look straight</strong>. So I’m standing there. I’m looking at the building. <strong>It didn’t look right</strong>, but, well, we’ll go in, we’ll see&quot;</p>

<p>Are you claiming all these men DIDN&#39;T see what they claim they saw?</p>

<p>Most architects and engineers have absolutely no issue with the NIST report on the WTC 7 collapse.</p>

<p>Firefighters are paid to know when a building is structurally unsound.  These firefighters were actually on the ground and inside WTC7.  They didn&#39;t make their determination from watching hours of YouTube videos, they were there.</p>

<p>They saw the building as a significant collapse risk hours before, and they were right.</p>

<p>The FDNY sure seemed to think it did. Since they are the ones paid to make that determination, and they are the ONLY ones who were anywhere near that building, I&#39;d say their opinion carries a lot of weight. They abandoned hundreds of their brothers who were dying in the rubble pile because they were so convinced building 7 was about to collapse. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, a 47 story building heavily damaged by debris and with fires burning unfought on over a dozen floors for 7 hours had never happened before. So what makes you think that is an easily predictable scenario? </p>

<p>You know what else has never happened before or since? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Controlled demolition of a building over 26 stories. </p></li>
<li><p>Controlled demolition of a building using thermite </p></li>
<li><p>Controlled demolition of a building that was still completely occupied by tenants</p></li>
<li><p>Controlled demolition of a building with 25 percent of the structure burning out of control for 7 hours. Exactly how did the demolition charges, triggers and miles and miles of wiring survive all that fire? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Seems like your controlled demolition scenario would have been equally unprecedented. By your rational, shouldn&#39;t that make it IMPOSSIBLE? </p>

<p>No, the controlled demolition theory isn&#39;t proven. To even suggest it is laughable. </p>

<p>The 26 story building that stands as the record for CD took months to wire up, with the building completely empty.

</blockquote>

<p>No conjecture at all.  Straight facts.  </p>

<p>It took 12 people 24 days to wire a <em>completely empty</em> building for demolition.  They needed <em>4118 charges in 1100 locations, nearly 3 thousand pounds of explosives and 36 THOUSAND feet of detonating cord</em> for that job.   They didn&#39;t have to worry about a thousand full time employees, security guards or camera crews finding them out either.</p>

<p>That building was just over HALF the size of WTC7.  That building also didn&#39;t have uncontrolled fires raging for hours before they pushed the button.</p>

<p>Again, the controlled demolition &quot;theory&quot; looks ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>

<p>You&#39;re attacking NIST without even knowing what the fucking report says????</p>

<p>Jesus Christ man.  Here, I&#39;ll give you a crash course:</p>

<p>The heat from the fires caused the 30 foot beams in the Northeast corner of the building to expand.  The beams would have expanded 0.0000065 inches per inch of original length per degree Fahrenheit, a process known as &quot;thermal expansion&quot;.  In that rate, a 50 foot steel beam would increase 0.39 inches per 100 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Based on the temperatures inside WTC7, those key floor beams in the northeast corner would have increased in length by over 4 inches.  At floor 13, that expansion sheared the bolts that connected column 79 to the girder reaching across to column 44. This would also explain the visible bulging defect seen by multiple firefighters on the ground between floors 10 and 13.</p>

<p>Increased expansion pushed that girder completely off the seat holding it against column 79, causing the 13th floor to collapse onto the floors below it.  That was what initiated the collapse. Column 79 had insufficient lateral support for the 33 floors above it at that point, causing it to buckle eastward.  That began a progressive collapse starting in the northeast corner of the building.</p>

<p>That progressive collapse can be seen in the video you guys so often cite.  The northeast portion of the penthouse develops a kink, followed by it collapsing into the interior of the building.  A couple seconds later, the west penthouse collapses in the same way.  Right after that,  the north facade also develops a kink, followed by the north facade collapsing.  Everything occurs from east to west in a progressive fashion starting directly above column 79.</p>

<p>No melting steel needed.  Got it?  Great.  Now you can stop parroting that bullshit lie, right?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Misunderstanding the OR altogether. Most often it is used to fortify any conventional position. It is erroneously used as a synonym to &quot;that which is outlandish, cannot be true&quot;. If OR was only ever applied this way, one only has to do outlandish things to stay out of its reach.</p></li>
<li><p>Basic strawman use. Combined with the misuse outlined above, this is a common problem I see occurring. It doesn&#39;t take a propaganda wizard to utilize OR in building up a reptilian strawman and accepting any proposed, reasonable-sounding alternative.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Motive,  means, opportunity.   Ever since Egypt and Rome,  people have been gaming whatever system there was,  and covering their tracks.   </p>

<p>Problem is the conversation is easily sidetracked to details that only experts with subpoena powers to get official information (assuming they would even get it) could seriously debate.   And even then,  there would be disagreements just like there are technical disagreements among experts on every issue in the world.   JFK and the bullets,  9/11 and freefall.   Are you a ballistics expert,  an engineer?   Then all you can do is pick one,  and side with them.   Against other experts.   Its not going to resolve anything, not without motive,  means,  opportunity.   Not the what,  but the who.</p>

<p>So,  some of the most significant data in a conspiracy is circumstantial.    Let&#39;s say we got a jury of 19 people in a jurisdiction where the judge was not already sold out (good luck with that!) and have experts present testimony regarding who benefited,  who had the means,  who had the opportunity.  Bush,  Blair,  Rumsfeld and dozens of others could be cross examined and related information subpoenaed.   Let&#39;s say that you had expert air line pilots,  experts in the demolition industry,  experts on the flight path of the plane that they say hit the pentagon,  experts in cell phone technology and commercial aircraft flight phone technology,  experts in the US air defense systems,  etc etc,  I wonder what the jury would decide?   </p>

<p>In totality,  even Occam&#39;s razor might say that it was just too weird that the official explanations could possibly have pat but bs answers for every strange thing that happened in the years and months before and after 9/11 that would have to add up.   Anthrax,  the Bush/Blair conversations,  Osama faked tapes,  the winners of the oil game,  the winners of the drug game,  the conversion from cold war to war on terror, etc etc.   How many fingers are pointing at random unrelated events?   A lot of it is there in the 9/11 timeline.   </p>

<p>But its all irrelevant. Dispassionate truth only happens after the subject is moved to the mythology and history shelves.   We can discuss ancient Greek history in ways that would blow your mind.    Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still too hot to touch.   Same with MLK, JFK, Vietnam.   The Civil War realities are just now starting to be really discussed,  and it isn&#39;t pretty.</p>

<p>There are 250 years of myth-making,  the whole story of the US at stake and there are over 300 million lives tied to a shark like system that dies if it stops moving.    The story works:  you have gas,  your fridge isn&#39;t empty,  and on Monday morning,  the whole thing rolls forward or if it doesn&#39;t,  there would be total chaos.</p>

<p>little bit of info:
Operation Gladio was the secret of secrets after WW2, developed by the US, enabled through Nato, administered locally, with governments often not knowing about it&#39;s existence or function.</p>

<p>very much a conspiracy.</p>

<p>basically it was designed to lead resistance to anything left of the political spectrum. killings and robberies all over Europe, Turkey and some say it was party to 9/11.</p>

<p>You’ve got to be lucky to make $4 Billion killing on a 6-month investment of $124 Million</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein is the New York property tycoon who purchased the entire WTC complex just 6 months prior to the 9/11 attacks. That was the first time in its 33-year history the complex had EVER changed ownership.</p>

<p>Mr. Silverstein’s first order of business as the new owner was to change the company responsible for the security of the complex. The new security company he hired was Securacom (now Stratasec). George W. Bush&#39;s brother, Marvin Bush, was on its board of directors, and Marvin’s cousin, Wirt Walker III, was its CEO. According to public records, not only did Securacom provide electronic security for the World Trade Center, it also covered Dulles International Airport and United Airlines — two key players in the 9/11 attacks. </p>
