    <div class="md"><p>have any of you done a reddit search for the link? </p>

<p>Its been posted fucking <strong><em>everywhere</em></strong>. over 70 times in the last 24 hours!</p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t remember ever searching for a single article that has been posted over 70 times like that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s received thousands of upvotes, some more than even the post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, just because only 6 people have voted one way or the other on the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> one doesn&#39;t make it censorship </p>

<p>But what do I know, I&#39;m just one of those guys who keeps getting called a shill, and I doubt this article is going to help alleviate that and turn me back into a real boy again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must now be aware that putting something in the spamfilter still renders the post viable, while affecting the ability of the story to be voted on from the new queue.</p>

<p>You must also not be aware that each subreddit has approached the censorship differently. For example, worldnews likes to allow two articles out of the spamfilter. Then they remove the one that gets more upvotes, leaving the other topic to fall into obscurity.</p>

<p><a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> mods actually use automod wiki settings to cull any unapproved words or topics, and this article was something that they continually removed.</p>

<p>The goal here is to keep the story from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> at all costs and if you&#39;re not aware of how the spamfitler works or how mods operate in the defaults then you would be well suited to keep your hostile tone to yourself. </p>

I am talking about a form of <em>me</em> being harassed thru this constant labeling and name calling simply because I often take a skeptical position and play devil&#39;s advocate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if that&#39;s pushing a line I&#39;ll stop referencing it directly, but I think the mods can look at the history and see that I am a reasoned and polite commenter despite the names I get called. Banning me would be way out of line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what rule am I meant to be violating? </p>

<p>tell me and i&#39;ll stop it. </p>

<p>If relaying the fact that I get called a shill (which <em>is</em> a violation of rule 10) is a violation of a rule then I&#39;ll stop. </p>

<p>If it is however I suggest that you clarify it in the sidebar because it doesn&#39;t appear to be that way. I though I could speak freely about things people have said so long as I was talking about things that you can look up in my history. </p>

<p>This all stems from an article about shills. All I can think about when I read the article and see the discussions of it is how many times I get called a shill simply for the views I hold and my ability to argue them. So I felt it wasn&#39;t out of place for me to reference it. Again if someone who is a mod and who&#39;s account isn&#39;t 2 months old would like to clarify I will gladly oblige. My only aim is reasonable discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> every day, for the past couple years. Several times a day. I am also a professional data analyst, to interject a bit at least to my skills to noticing irregularities. All of the Snowden leaks have been near the top of Reddit very quickly. This one is getting &quot;old&quot; in internet time, and it never came close to the top. If Reddit was my job, I would be spinning off time to devote to figuring out why that irregularity occurred. Part of it may be due to Greenwald running his own site recently, maybe people don&#39;t know about it. But all it takes is one link to get upvoted, and if you search you find tons of submitted links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting. We have that same anomaly here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regarding cliché posts and images. You seem to attribute it to linking it to other websites, but I suspect that they run a form of up- and downvote script. Sometimes, there&#39;s a discrepancy between comment- and post upvotes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not surprising. If Reddit gets millions of visitors per day, controlling it would be their top priority. Check top posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> this last year and it&#39;s all Snowden images. It could be because of the short attention span of people and mobile use, but I think there&#39;s more to it. </p>

Apart from being spied on, the Five Eyes want to change perceptions about topics being discussed freely on the internet amongst like minded people. It shows that there is a need to change discussions because it is out of control of an editor that is part of their agenda.</p>

<p>*We submitted numerous questions to GCHQ, including: (1) Does GCHQ in fact engage in “false flag operations” where material is posted to the Internet and falsely attributed to someone else?; (2) Does GCHQ engage in efforts to influence or manipulate political discourse online?; and (3) Does GCHQ’s mandate include targeting common criminals (such as boiler room operators), or only foreign threats?</p>

<p>theres a serious size and resource difference between US and UK TLA orgs, in the UK resources are tight, here in the US there are multitudes of ex veterans who need jobs when they leave the military, they go to work for the TLAs and still want to be &#39;GI Joes&#39; in their new office jobs, so active operations are going to be in vogue, anything to make their new office jobs more exciting and relevant for funding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of the many pressing stories that remains to be told from the Snowden archive</strong> is how western intelligence agencies are attempting to manipulate and control online discourse with extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction. <strong>It’s time to tell a chunk of that story, complete with the relevant documents.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it comes from the trove of documents that Snowden leaked.</p>

<p>Some questions for you...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why are former NSA and security analysts verifying the documents?</p></li>
<li><p>Why has the UK and the US said themselves the documents are real and are pursuing prosecution of Snowden and Greenwald including intimidation and deleting hard drives, stealing laptops from Greenwald&#39;s home and breaking into Jacob Appelbaums apartment in Berlin?</p></li>
<li><p>Why has no one from anywhere claimed that the documents are fake?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The only way this Is fake is if everyone concerned is involved and pushing the narrative.</p>

<p>domestically for US citizens/residents, the concern is the NSA being nosey bastards in our domestic lives, the blanket monitoring of everything everybody does in the US, what they do (snooping) to foreigners is not really of much concern to anybody here in the US. </p>

<p>people outside the US should be concerned about the NSA, but whatever they say and do is relative to their domestic govts, its their problem, their local solution.</p>

<p>two separate problems, each relative to domestic and foreign, but both exclusive.</p>
