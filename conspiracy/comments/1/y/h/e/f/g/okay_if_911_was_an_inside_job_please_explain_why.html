<p>For eight years after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged right in center of Philadelphia&#39;s business district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do something with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998.</p>

<p>Now you are disagreeing with your government&#39;s version of WTC7&#39;s improbable demolition.  You sure you want to go that route? Now you&#39;re doubting the scientists that you supported a comment ago...</p>

<p>Actually;</p>

<ul>
<li>In a video, it appears that WTC 7 is descending in free fall, something that would not occur in the structural collapse that you describe. How can NIST ignore basic laws of physics?
In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm</a>), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, you think NIST is wrong, but anyone who isn&#39;t NIST is wrong too? Also, I quoted from NIST itself in my previous comments involving fire, meaning it is worth giving at least some care to what I say.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely accurate. I really think that we are all just trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together and when our gov&#39;t isn&#39;t transparent and they have a lot to be gained from 9/11, it draws attention. Conspiracy theorists&#39; job is to ask questions. We want to find out what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC 7 collapse conspiracies have been completely debunked countless times.  They basically amounted to non-experts watching footage and saying, &quot;Why did that building fall so fast when it wasn&#39;t hit by a plane?  Looked like a controlled demolition to me.&quot;  It looked like a controlled demolition, of course, because in both cases a building collapses.  <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/1227842">Popular Mechanics did a series</a> debunking the most common claims that is a pretty easy read.  In particular, check out <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center#wtc7">the WTC 7 section.</a></p>

<p>The only thing truly suspicious about the event and reports on it were the sections made classified that (apparently) implicated high-ranking Saudis as conspirators (Saudi Arabia is an ally, for better or probably worse).</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists seem to not want to believe the &quot;government story&quot; because they think that &quot;propaganda&quot; necessarily involves lying.  This is inaccurate--propaganda can be true.  You can bet that when something happens that bolsters a government&#39;s positions on something, they are going to report the shit out of it.  Doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen to begin with.</p>

<p>For eight years after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged right in center of Philadelphia&#39;s business district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do something with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998.</p>
