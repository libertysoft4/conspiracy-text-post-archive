        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Through a fellow DoD coworker, I have learned that a local, yet major, ammunition manufacturer makes 4,000,000 rounds of .22 caliber ammo a day.  All of this ammo is subsequently purchased by the United States government and will never be in the hands of private citizens.  This is all I know, the source is extremely reliable, and I cannot elaborate on location or manufacturer.  Note:  this isn&#39;t a leak, I just want to protect individuals that work for the company.</p>

<p>What do you guys think that the government is doing with 4,000,000/day rounds of .22 since .22 ammunition is not used in law enforcement and/or military?  Has anyone read elsewhere of similar circumstances?  We are thinking of this as a case of since they cannot control guns, this is an effort to control ammo.  Also, what happens to the ammo manufactured if it is never used by the government or private citizen?</p>

<p>Input, similar instances, and discussion would be appreciated.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>EDIT: I get if you don&#39;t want to drop names but you can definitely give the name of the factory. </p>

<p>.22 is the most popular caliber in the country. It is good for small game hunting, and for a while (not sure if still the case) it was the deadliest round in the country against law enforcement, because it is small enough to sometimes squeeze its way through traditional kevlar fibers where a bigger round would not fit and be stopped cold. It is also one of the only rounds out there that is in fact literally silent when shooting suppressed, depending on the load. Much fanfare is made about all the bigger bullets, all the teeth that crowns all the wicked-looking hollow-points, all the grains, weights, all the ballistic nonsense that pervades arguments of this caliber vs that caliber, but at the end of the day, .22s are lightweight, very deadly, and very popular. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if the government decided to strangle the supply. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>.22 is the round you want when fighting hordes of zombies, because it&#39;s popular (easy to find in survival situations post-apocalypse), deadly to humans (and other things), while being lightweight enough to carry lots (<em>for the horde</em>) and like you said silent when supressed (because zombies know what the difference in sounds between supressed firearms and unsupressed firearms and react accordingly).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only problem with this post is there is no proof of what you are saying. There is three reasons this is happening. Point 1 is there is shit loads of conversation kits for gus to be converted from there caliber to .22lr to make it more practical to shoot so more shooters equal less rounds for everyone. Point 2 is that I don&#39;t care what you say companies (I.e Fred Mayers, Big 5, Cabeles) all have ammo they will tell you this they will not sell you any unless you buy a new gun from them. Point 3 the government/banks/companies are hoarding it to drive the price up to make more money. My opinion is it is a combination of all three points why upgrade your equipment when you will make more by not doing it.</p>

<p>As it stands today, NO ONE in the military uses .22, or .22 converted M4s or M16 service rifles to train on. You are wrong, and there is no debating that. It&#39;s just a fact. Go join the marine corps if you you don&#39;t believe me. </p>
