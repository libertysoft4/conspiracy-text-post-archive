        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It looks like only Kaspersky labs were able to discover a powerful spying software that is being installed in computers dierectly in bios by the producers. </p>

<p>The strange fact is that only Kaspersky are claiiming that it is very dangerous, but this news was not spread enough. </p>

<p>Which is trange, Kaspersky is pretty serious, there must news sources interested in what they say, instead nobody seems interested.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/kaspersky_computrace/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/kaspersky_computrace/</a></p>

<p>Kaspersky said that the software is being installed by the manufacturers, and is supposed to be activated only by the owner. But the problem is that the software is being activated automatically, without the owner&#39;s consent. Which puts computers in danger, while the owners are unaware of their computers being exposed to a spying tool connected directly to their bios.</p>

<p>You must reasearch further this thing. It is obvious that the western media are trying not to expose this news for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let&#39;s elaborate here. This isn&#39;t spyware being installed to a BIOS. It&#39;s tracking software designed to locate computers if stolen. It&#39;s the same type of service that Lojack provides.</p>

<p>What these experts are saying is that the software can be exploited. They aren&#39;t saying that there&#39;s spyware out there that now installs itself into the BIOS. That&#39;s a big difference.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that all tracking software designed into laptops can be exploited in some way or another. I&#39;m actually surprised that it&#39;s taken a security company this long to make a statement about the possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, that&#39;s just scare mongering. You have to boot into the BIOS to turn the feature on so I&#39;d guess Geek Squad or whatever overpriced service who &quot;prepared&quot; the computer. And honestly, it should be turned on. If Computrace or Lojack aren&#39;t enabled you can&#39;t find your stolen computer.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the full report. Please read the section that details their search for computers with computrace already activated through the software.</p>

<p>Not once did they infer that computrace had the ability to install itself without user interaction. They only state that it was ALREADY activated. Now, whether that was performed by the manufacturer, a third party, or a previous owner isn&#39;t necessarily clear.</p>

<p>The important thing here is that in order for the hardware module to install the software and service there has to be some type of user interaction. Even in the computers that were found to have the service running it&#39;s possible that the module was enabled by a previous user.</p>

<p>If a computer was returned by a customer who activated the software and resold to another customer the module in the BIOS will automatically install the software since it was previously enabled. That&#39;s part of the design. It&#39;s there so that if your computer is wiped or the hard drive is swapped the software will re-install itself allowing the module to report it&#39;s location.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That only happens if it&#39;s enabled in the BIOS and registered. The software is designed to reinstall itself when enabled and only when enabled. So that means that a person had to enable it in the BIOS before the customer received the computer. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s either a technician testing out the system before shipping, A Geek Squad-esque type employee &quot;setting up&quot; the system before releasing the system to the customer, or a previous owner enabling the system.</p>

<p>This is stated in the design of the software. It&#39;s designed to bring itself back to life if a hard drive is yanked. The telling fact is that these guys didn&#39;t mention whether they checked the BIOS to verify the system was indeed disabled before firing the system up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No ive read about this i work in IT. The new intel processors have a 3g chip and some sort of battery all on the chip, it has just enough juice to spin the hard drive to read/write data even with the plug is removed from the wall. So bad citizen can now come home from holidays to find kiddie porn on the PC.</p>

<p>Ive also read about bad bios. If the wifi/ethernet cable/ bluetooth has been removed/disabled. It transmits data using the speakers. High frequency modulation soundwaves to transmit data to or to infect close by machines.</p>

<p>Its a brave new world.</p>

<p>And the 3g chip in the new processors are undocumented by the way. Its for (remote management in large businesses/not consumers). But we all get them</p>

<p>I still see some holes. 3g isnt powerful enough to reach through a heatsink fan and case, especially when the power supply tech is supposed to provide power when not plugged in. As for the high frequency signals, yeah that could work under such insanely controlled environments I doubt you would find any in real life. </p>

<p>If a speaker (Consumer quality) can modulate a signal what the hell is demodulating it at the other end?</p>

<p>But the story gets stranger still. In posts here, here, and here, Ruiu posited another theory that sounds like something from the screenplay of a post-apocalyptic movie: &quot;badBIOS,&quot; as Ruiu dubbed the malware, has the ability to use high-frequency transmissions passed between computer speakers and microphones to bridge airgaps.</p>

<p>I also think that 99.9% of consumer tech couldnt modulate a signal or demodulate it the hardware is just too shitty.

<p>Case in point. I have an iPhone 5. Would love the 5s but legally speaking and for privacy as well (i have no criminal background/record). Where im from you cant be compelled to give a password in most cases. The right to not incriminate yourself or the right to privacy or even (I cant remember my password).

    <div class="md"><p>A warning from a mod is a personal attack?  But insinuating that a user is mentally challenged by directing them to an autism subreddit is normal behavior?</p>

<p>If we wish to, as a community, transcend beyond the assigned stereotypes prescribed to our members, we must first redefine ourselves by being superior debaters and not falling back onto fallacious logic such as personal attacks.</p>

<p>I highly recommend accepting your slap on the wrist and studying Graham&#39;s hierarchy of disagreement.  You&#39;ll notice that the top three levels of the pyramid are logically sound where the 4th level is neutral, and everything below that is intellectually disingenuous and logically fallacious.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t continue down this road, you honestly seem like a decent person and a valuable contributor to this community.  This will be your final warning.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need to have an education before using big words to understand the meaning. </p>

<p>This is also a thinly veiled personal attack.  The next action against your account will be a ban so please don&#39;t hastily respond to this message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMFG! It&#39;s BS that the manufacturers (Dell, Lenovo, HP, Sony, etc.) install on their base images that they send to the distributor or end-user. They&#39;ve been doing this for at least 20 years now. The assbags never read fucking anything, or care to know shit about their new PCs, so the software remains installed, waiting to be rage clicked by an ignorant user.</p>

<p>This is entirely the user&#39;s fault. Their hell-bent ignorance should cost them, every time &quot;It&#39;s too hard.&quot; Absolute Computrace should be known as a POS. You get it free with your PC. They couldn&#39;t even sell their shit products, and must give freebies. Do you accept free software from random people walking the street? Well if you do, you deserve what you get.</p>

<p>There are multiple products like this, bundled with any major PC retailer. All PCs must be cleaned of BS when purchased. And, no, this is not a &quot;Windoze&quot; problem. Many nix distros are equally full of ridiculous, half-broken software you would never want.</p>
