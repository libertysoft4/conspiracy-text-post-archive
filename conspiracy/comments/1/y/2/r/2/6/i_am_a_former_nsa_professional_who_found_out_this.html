        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, just coincidentally this morning, I happened to notice an account history page on Reddit that shows an ip address log of where your account is being logged in from. I opened it up and to my surprise, my Reddit account is apparently being actively used or monitored by the NSA and DoD. I then proceeded to Google the ip addresses and locations and compare them against all of my social media accounts and lo and behold the Government has decided I am a very interesting person and is actively monitoring all of them. Not only that, but my new Android phone, which I very much hate, is also being routed through the DoD. What bothers me is that this is obviously only the stuff they purposely intended to let me know they are monitoring - so who really knows what is being recorded in secret.</p>

<p>My thoughts on the situtation:</p>

<ol>
<li>My plan is to cease and close all social media activity at this point. Any post you see beyond this is not me. In fact, if it didn&#39;t come from in person - it wasn&#39;t me. </li>
<li> I am now ashamed to ever have held a position at NSA or worked for the government in that capacity. </li>
<li> I feel responsible for ever contributing to this big brother nanny state that feels the need to capture the data of private citizens like myself.</li>
<li> I will be destroying all of my data stored in the cloud and replacing my personal hard drives to destroy &quot;potential evidence&quot; they are trying to gather.</li>
<li> I will be strongly considering telling my story in other more secretive forums - I think the intelligence industry has vastly overstepped their bounds and will take necessary steps to advocate for limited scope in spying.</li>
<li>If I am arrested/detained/dead in the next year, you will know why.</li>
<li>NSA/DoD/All you dirty nosy government fuckfaces reading this: COME AT ME BRO!</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Perhaps.  My wife and I discussed the potential implication of the whole NSA scandals from time to time - and I&#39;ve had concerns for a while - but I really thought it was blown out of proportion until the Snowden stuff came to light.  I&#39;m still debating with myself how much I can really get away with exposing.  I was involved with one of the very first missions to use GPS and drones.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit nerve wracking because I do have a family to consider.  </p>

<p>But at the same time this has larger implications for privacy and humanity as a whole.</p>

<p>So, if there is cowardice, it&#39;s only because I&#39;m scared what would become of my family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a valid criticism. I just assumed that I am a small fish in a large ocean and now I feel I should be speaking up more and sooner. It&#39;s just scary how they can break in your house, destroy all of your stuff, plant any evidence they want, and you have no legal recourse. I have a family that depends on me for income. </p>

<p>The tools are very compartmentalized though. However there is still a human element to everything that can be exploited. At the end of the day average people are still running these systems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically the internet isn&#39;t a tangible thing.  Its just a bunch of computers linked together in a massive, nebulous cloud.  No one really even knows how big it is.  So your phone links to the closest tower, which transmits via copper or fiber to various trunks and switches from the telco company.  From there it is directed to the server that you called up with the URL.  The URL is just a name assigned to an ip address and an ip address is actually a lot like a mailing address.  Basically it directs you down to the continent, country, region, City, etc... To get to the server that you want, you have to travel via a zillion other servers.  How your request travels has a lot to do with how heavy the internet traffic is.  It&#39;s possible that you can get bumped all over the country before you end up at one of the many servers that give you access to reddit.  That is my best understanding of it.  Keep in mind that even as a telecomm guy for 20 years, I am a hardware guy.  My expertise ends at the &quot;cell phone to telco company&quot; end of things.  So if I have missed or screwed up something past that, hopefully someone will correct me.</p>

<p>Edit:  thinking about it more.  Its most likely that your phone is assigned to a larger switch in Tennessee which can handle the load better than the switch in Kentucky when phone traffic gets heavy.</p>

<p>After further research most of day, there seems to be convenient explanations for each of these scenarios, but I&#39;m still uncomfortable with it.</p>

<p>For example, frequently mobile lines borrow non-used IP from DoD, however, I&#39;m still confused as to why both my regular mobile IP (from t-mobile) and supposed &quot;borrowed&quot; ip show as logged in - sometimes when I am not even on reddit and my phone is not even turned on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s world wide.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nowhere they can&#39;t reach. o.o</p>

<p>Lest that&#39;s what thier octopus satilete told me. e.e</p>

<p>NSA is global, it&#39;s not just americans, it&#39;s everyone, and it&#39;s alot of data. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s hardly as evil as some would think, it&#39;s all about making thier corperate masters more money. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want to silence ppl, they want to figure out what you&#39;re willing to watch, listen to, and buy, so you&#39;ll be a happy lil slave while 1% of the population hold half the wealth.</p>

<p>If they took a cut of 1/15, and gave to the world, every person on the planet would be twice as wealthy.</p>

<p>For those detract that this would cause deflation, as long as the value of money only supports the highest percentage of ppl while others struggle to simple make ends (a concept i know alot of internet weilding americans have trouble comprehending), then you can start to see how, while ofcourse the brain surgeon makes more than the ditch digger, the ceo shouldn&#39;t be making more than both do in a year in a fucking hour. </p>

<p>Pardon my language, and carry on.</p>

<p>(For record this post was prolonged from posting. New though, so that might be normal, idk. Since we&#39;re all conspiritarding out, I&#39;mma just blame Obama and be done with it e.e ((Humor, downvote good sense freely. It was a poorly made joke.)) )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I know the answer.  There&#39;s a couple things to keep in mind.</p>

<p>1)  Most of the people who do the dirty work are dumb as shit - seriously - most of them are 18 year old kids straight out of high school.  The government has the idea they promote of the NSA being seasoned professionals, while most of them are military kids straight out of high school, not even old enough to drink.  I couldn&#39;t begin to list the number of analysts I knew who served some of the highest priority missions with TS/SCI clearances for six months, before getting kicked out for doing dumb fuck things (like holding underage women hostage in their barracks room).</p>

<p>2) There might some intimidation factor or at play, or they simply don&#39;t care since NSA monitoring everyone&#39;s shit is now pretty common knowledge.</p>

<p>3) I could be mistaken.  The ip address I&#39;m getting are from a DoD base in Ohio, and there seems to be a lot of conspiracy theories related to that particular range of IP&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting about Ohio.  Years ago there was a prolific poster in this sub who I conversed with quite a bit about the occult.  Someone got suspicious of him and ran a whois and his IP was at an Ohio DoD facility (listed on Google maps as a supply routing depot).  After this came out, he disappeared for a long time, resurfaced briefly and most recently (not that recently) was posting in /conspiratard.</p>

<p>This makes sense. My history shows IPs out of Florida, which I&#39;m nowhere near. However, they belong to Akamai, and I know the company&#39;s services: it&#39;s likely my mobile provider uses them as an intermediary to speed up serving of web content.

<p>Yes I did type that.  Yes, I feel a bit silly for doing so.  </p>

<p>But for a long time I just lurked quietly and didn&#39;t care about the whole monitoring situation - but now I am feeling frustrated and antagonistic.  </p>

<p>Even if it were a keylogger or a virus, that would be just as bad since NSA designs/uses them to their advantage.</p>

<p>The only reason I will be destroying my data is because NSA has a reputation/policy for making a spectacle out of people that disagree with them, much like they attempted to do with Snowden at first, and the Disney movie about Wikileaks.  I really don&#39;t have anything to hide - I&#39;m a pretty mundane person - but I also know how they are capable of making a case against anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting about Ohio.  Years ago there was a prolific poster in this sub who I conversed with quite a bit about the occult.  Someone got suspicious of him and ran a whois and his IP was at an Ohio DoD facility (listed on Google maps as a supply routing depot).  After this came out, he disappeared for a long time, resurfaced briefly and most recently (not that recently) was posting in /conspiratard.</p>
