    <div class="md"><p>How about the possibility that I know more on this subject than you, and you&#39;re just making an assumption that the Royals are looting the poor populace to fund their castle-building exploits?</p>

<p>Since 1760 the hereditary revenues of the Crown have been turned over to the UK coffers in return for the Civil List. The Crown Estate is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom, with holdings of £7.3 billion in 2011. It is held <strong>in trust</strong>, and cannot be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity.</p>

<p>In modern times, the profits surrendered from the Crown Estate have exceeded the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid. For example, the Crown Estate produced £200 million for the Treasury in the financial year 2007–8, whereas reported parliamentary funding for the monarch was £40 million during the same period.</p>

<p>But I suppose I must be brainwashed for thinking that £200 million  is a bigger number than £40 million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just floating some ideas. </p>

<p>However deplorable you feel it to be, humans are social creatures who are innately interested in alpha humans - always have been. </p>

<p>And the mass media coverage of celebrity lifestyles, conditions the beta humans to care about alphas even more. When Princess Diana died, millions felt her death more deeply than the deaths of their own relatives. Sad but true.</p>

<p>Many Americans feel a certain affinity with the UK - there are strong cultural and economic links as well as a common language. British Royalty is part of American history, and they are therefore more interesting than, say, Japanese Royals.</p>

<p>The popularity of the US first family is mitigated by Obama&#39;s personal unpopularity (amongst half the nation) and his politics, so an alternative alpha family is sought out. The better looking British Royals (nobody cares about the ugly ones) provide a &quot;real&quot; soap opera that allows people to fantasise. </p>
