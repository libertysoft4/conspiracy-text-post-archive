    <div class="md"><p>The ice caps are not melting, this has been debunked, the IPCC and related organizations have a monopoly on the mainstream science rags and they refuse to publish anything outside of their viewpoint.  You have been duped.  Antarctica is actually growing ice at a record rate, a big chunk of ice just fell off because it was so heavy.  Stop going to &quot;green&quot; sites and all of that bullshit.  The UN is using this &quot;problem&quot; to get a &quot;reaction&quot;(radical environmentalism) to bring about their predetermined solution (global governance).  It&#39;s blatantly obvious if you actually do real research and stop relying on those stupid &quot;peer reviewed&quot; papers, that are reviewed by &quot;peers&quot; who agree and are also funded by the IPCC and related foundations.  </p>

<p>The goal is to de-industrialize the western nations and bring about forced poverty and &quot;socialist communitarianism&quot;, once again, it&#39;s blatant if you do <em>actual research</em> instead of just relying on &quot;experts&quot; to do all of the thinking for you.</p>

<p>Do we not keep having year over year rises in temperature?</p>

<p>OK. Lets they do want to make a world government...how does that change what we&#39;ve observed in climate, in air chemical composition like CO2 ppm ratios, and shifting weather patterns?</p>

<p>I&#39;m very open to point out flaws in all the popular positions, but are you suggesting that ALL of it is wrong? Even the increased consumption of fossil fuels as a result of larger populations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s put it this way, it is a well known fact that the earth was in a &quot;mini-ice age&quot; until the end of the 1800s.  Any warming that is happening is happening because the earth&#39;s temperature is normalizing or just going through a different phase.  To think that humans can affect the climate of the planet based on the release of a trace gas into the atmosphere is ridiculous, we aren&#39;t even contributing a fraction of a percentage point into the air worth of CO2.  Think about back in the 30s through the 60s when everyone had fireplaces and <em>everyone</em> was burning huge fires everyday to keep warm, whole cities were engulfed in smoke constantly, now there is ONE fire in the middle of town that creates energy for everyone.  I would say the pollutants have gone <em>down</em>.  They are blaming the fossil fuel industry so that they can dramatically raise the price of fuel = massive profits for the conglomerates who also &quot;coincidentally&quot; own the huge &quot;alternative fuel&quot; industries as well, just do a little research, like I said.

<p>Why is that ridiculous? </p>

<p>And yes we are contributing significant amounts of our waste into the air. Are you seriously suggesting that we aren&#39;t? </p>

<p>You have no problem recognizing the greenhouse effect, right?</p>

<p>Nuclear Winter never seems to fly over your head...right?</p>

<p>But the fact that consistent human consumption might lead to climate change is now hogwash?</p>

<p>REALLY???</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

<p>There is no such thing as clean coal and your example is a poor analogy. </p>

<p>The fact that theres one place doing it for MORE people means that MORE is being consumed...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I would say the pollutants have gone down.</em></p>

<p>What you would &quot;say&quot; isn&#39;t true or even supported by evidence. We&#39;re emitting more toxic waste at an unprecedented waste and this doesn&#39;t even include countries who don&#39;t give a damn about OUR ecological wellbeing like China, or India, or Brazil. </p>

You actually <em>trust</em> IPCC funded &quot;climatologists&quot; who rely on computer modeling to make their &quot;predictions&quot;.  You&#39;ve never looked into the Club Of Rome who in the 70s made the declaration that they needed a global problem to bring about a &quot;global solution&quot; which was a world federal government, the &quot;problem&quot; they devised was man-made global climate change, the plan was to de-industrialize the western nations and force everyone into socialist communitarianism to live as serfs under an oligarchical rule.  But you won&#39;t look into this stuff because it contradicts your &quot;beliefs&quot;, because that is what they are, you are being indoctrinated into the new religion of &quot;earth worship&quot;.

In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up

changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.

<p>But how do solar maximums account for increased consumption of global fuel reserves and their waste products?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. more team fucking sports. honestly, such thinking is ridiculous.</p>

<p>here&#39;s a <a href="http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/solar-system/sun-stormy-star/#page=8">nat geo article</a> on some connections between solar activity and effects on earth. and yes, i&#39;m sure our carbon output is part of the gestalt total effect. </p>

<p>will forcing people to exhale into co2 masks and charging them for replacements help? nah. </p>

<p>should we then not worry and continue to mine living environments for toxic fuels? yeah, nah.</p>

<p>so, do you think your query here will do anything to help bring clarity and inspire solutions? i don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t answer my question.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand is all.</p>

<p>Some people are saying this is apart of global domination.</p>

<p>OK. Lets say it is. </p>

<p>What does that have to do with the geological changes we&#39;re observing?</p>

<p>I mean that just seems like a false dichotomy and never gets addressed.</p>

<p>Raising temps doesn&#39;t lead to a world power structure...people wanting a world power structure lead to a world power structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAARP has to date produced no information its ability to change the weather. That has always been speculation, never proven. All HAARP has been shown to do is research on communications in the ionosphere. Yes, we have been seeding clouds with silver-iodide or something, but what does that have to do with HAARP?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen legitimate info on chemtrails other than CONtrails, which are clouds of condensation left by planes. However, the Govt spray San Francisco with some aerosolized bacteria in the 60s but you can&#39;t correlate all perceived incidents to be from a single cause or motive. </p>
