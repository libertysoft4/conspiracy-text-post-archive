        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been posting this as comments on relevant threads, thought I would just submit it as a story in its own right.</p>

<p>I apologize for the length of this. It is nuanced and, frankly, uninteresting... I&#39;ve spent an inordinate amount of time researching this, so I present to you my findings in their lengthy and unedited form.</p>

<p>The original papers establishing HIV as the cause of AIDS show evidence of fraud and scientific misconduct / falsification.  So there is the current head of the Institute of Human Virology - Robert Gallo... hes the guy who supposedly made this discovery. Well the first paper published in Nature magazine was written and researched by his research assistant Mikalus Popovich. The first draft of the paper stated that &quot;despite intensive research efforts, the causative agent of AIDS has not been found&quot;. And then made very clear that it was an assumption with very limited proof that they were putting forth HTLV-III as the causative agent.  So Gallo makes edits to this paper, where he crosses out essentially this entire paragraph and rewrites it, utterly changing the meaning and hiding the doubt that the Popovich expressed. <a href="http://fearoftheinvisible.com/fraud-in-key-hiv-research-background">This can be found here. Read the book its pretty good stuff. Well reviewed on Amazon</a></p>

<p>Theres a lot of other things he did in the paper that don&#39;t really stand up to scientific due diligence. In the published paper he adds the word &quot;cytopathic&quot; to the title of the paper (meaning that it was illustrated to kill/damage cells), but no where in the paper or in the papers cited does he show that. The only illustration of cytopathy is through indirect means about their other two virus (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). Cytopathy in HTLV-III is never established, yet there it is in the title. In fact, to this very day, how HIV supposedly kills cells is very much an area of conjecture.  (See aside at bottom for more information)</p>

<p>Also he had some micrographs of what he claimed were HIV, but you can see from that link, his electron micrograph person wrote him a letter and told him they were cell detritus. He expresses the micrographs as HTLV-III (now known as HIV) in the published paper.</p>

<p>Finally theres sentences in the paper that simply are not very scientific... very uncharacteristic for something that was actually peer reviewed. For example, &quot;Although patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS are often chronically infected with cytomegalovirus and hepatits B virus, for various reasons these appear to be opportunistic or coincidental infections.&quot; That&#39;s the whole statement... &quot;for various reasons&quot; is allowed to slide as evidence for that statement. theres no citation, nothing...  keep in mind, this is the FIRST paper about HTLV-III and its connection to AIDS... and the edits were made 2 weeks before it was published. Popvich didn&#39;t write anything about these being opportunistic or coincidental infections. Gallo did. 2 weeks before publishing. Without a single shred of evidence. That is fraud.</p>

<p><a href="http://fearoftheinvisible.com/gallodefendsemai">Gallo responded to the woman who wrote the book that made these discoveries.  He only made one specific objection in regards to an investigation done by the Secret Service that found he did in fact fix these papers. He claimed she committed Libel and Slander. Interestingly enough, he nor any of those he claims she has slandered have ever filed suit against her.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aliveandwellsf.org/articles/NEW%20ARTICLES/classics/popovic_gallo_isolation_1984.pdf">For your reference the published paper is here</a></p>

<p>So those things are pretty solid evidence of fraud / scientific misconduct / at the very best scientific incompleteness along with blaring conjecture. Which opens the door to a whole host of theories and investigations which I have linked to for you below. The first two are award winning, well reviewed documentaries available on youtube. The rabbit hole is deep on this one, I wished, looking back on it, I was actually a nut... but the evidence really suggests to me (a fairly even headed facts based person) that something very fishy is going on in this industry, at least at the foundational level. </p>

</ul>

<p>(In regards to establishing HTLV-III as existing and the cause... their line of reasoning is this:
  * Cats get immune sickness
  * Immune sickness is caused by depleted CD4 cells.
  * Therefor, it must be a new type of a virus i already did research on</p>

<p>Seriously thats the deductive process put forth in Gallo&#39;s edits. The establishment of cytopathy is solely by means of illustrating syncytia formation (where cells bundle up). Well the problem there is that happens a lot in natural situations non specific to virus infection. In fact, there are all sorts of things you can do to the culture medium and prevent or encourage cell syncytia... so hardly conclusive evidence that you have a virus killing/hindering cells... Also remember, our cultures are chronically infected with other syncytia forming virus... including the cytomegalovirus, hepatitis b virus, AND HTLV-I and HTLV-II. So the question is... how did you eliminate the HTLV-I and the HTLV-II and the cytomegalovirus, and the hepatits b virus in your cultures and establish that your new HTLV-III was the sole cause of the cytopathy that was so important and conclusive that you edited the paper to put it in the title). </p>

<p>Remember, because cats get immune sickness, and immune sickness is caused by depleted CD4 cells....  these people have a new strain of a virus they&#39;ve spent their lives &quot;researching&quot;....  thats the foundational reasoning put forth in these initial papers. )</p>

<p>(Second note, the people that do some digging into this industry often become very public targets... far incongruent with what you see in other industries...  Like if someone says ALS isn&#39;t real, or Polio is caused by chemicals.... they dont become the result of organized media smear campaigns, violent emails from pharmaceutical lobbyists, hacking attempts from Los Alamos National Laboratory, cutting of all grants for research (these all have happened to people, as you can see in the above links) Theres a clear, organized, and ruthless opposition force to this line of thinking... which when combined with the shakiness of their foundational papers... has me thinking if it looks like a house of cards, walks like a house of cards, talks like a house of cards.... then its probably a house of cards)</p>

<p>EDIT:  Its been fun arguing with some of you. Even with all this arguing and banter.... none of you have directly addressed the issue of fraud here in this paper... you&#39;ve all diverted the argument away from the blaring evidence of fraud that no one has answered to and the people involved continue to siphon billions of dollars away from the coffers of the american tax payer endlessly and hopelessly hunting and claiming to cure a phantom plauge.  And while we ended up with - votes... we did get quite a few upvotes... which means theres more people out there asking questions that nobody in this industry is capable of giving answers for. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Well i only lost 400 or so karma from arguing this... not bad... fuck me right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. But what is your point? This paper was written almost 30 years ago. There are hundreds, if not thousands more recent papers that elucidate HIV and its role in CD4 cell infection (via gp120). Regardless of how it kills immune cells (it undoubtedly kills some via viral budding), the fact is that cd4 cell numbers drop. Once you get below 200 cd4/mm<sup>3</sup> in your blood, you have aids. It&#39;s a somewhat abstract definition of the disease, but that&#39;s what it is. I actually have a virology exam tomorrow, so this is relevant to my interests. On my phone now and can&#39;t provide sources, but would love to continue this conversation later</p>

<p>Edit- if your point is that HIV was created by the gov, maybe it was, I have no clue. But you seem to be arguing that HIV might not cause aids, which I do not believe to be the case. Btw, certainly not boring! Scientists make stuff up all the time. Check out <a href="http://www.science-fraud.org">www.science-fraud.org</a> . Anyone who does research will appreciate and laugh at the blatant copying/pasting of bands on electrophoresis gels</p>

<p>2) I&#39;m pressed for time and can&#39;t read the whole paper, but the &quot;various reasons&quot; statement probably was inferred  by what they knew about the virus. Aids won&#39;t kill you, but the fact that it attacks your immune system means you are susceptible to other infections.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>HIV is thought to be derived from a simian immunodeficiency virus and is genetically most similar to a chimpanzee virus. In fact, HIV-2 is similar to simian immunodeficiency virus. The initial human infection occurred  in Africa in the 1930s but went unnoticed in rural areas. The migration of infected people to the cities after the 1960&#39;s brough the virus into population centers and cultural acceptance of prostitution promoted its transmission throughout the population</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cv3xiLwQ8dwC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=medical+microbiology+murray+6th+edition&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=_nXDUKPEL46y0AGooYGYBg&amp;amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA">Murray</a> HIV most likely evolved from a simian virus during the 1930&#39;s. </p>

<p>He has also stated in this thread that HIV came about due to a contaminated vaccination attempt in Africa. If you are likely referring to polio vaccination which has been widely disputed due to molecular biology and phylogenetic studies as noted by <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5472/1757">Hillis</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5517/615.1.summary">Cohen</a>, and <a href="http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1127661/reload=0;jsessionid=f9xKwbyhCG79n2JipShJ.60.">Hooper</a></p>

<p>Also OP goes on to state that:</p>

<blockquote>

So the question is... how did you eliminate the HTLV-I and the HTLV-II and the cytomegalovirus, and the hepatits b virus in your cultures and establish that your new HTLV-III was the sole cause of the cytopathy that was so important and conclusive that you edited the paper to put it in the title). </p>

<p>Also OP:</p>

<p>Lets make it clear that the assumption made at the time was that there was a new agent, based on the ones which all of them had spent their lives researching, in the mixture of viruses.... that was causing them to get sick..... not that these people lifestyles were causing them to be exposed to all these nasty virus&#39;s and causing them to get sick....  the former reasoning requires the assumption of existence of a new agent... for which they had absolutely NO EVIDENCE existed, much less was causing illness....  the latter requires no leap of faith. one is clearly a more sound scientific argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets face it, whatever killed people in the 1980s IS NOT WHAT HIV/AIDS is today. There are, according to their statistics, millions of UNDIAGNOSED cases of HIV where no treatment is ever sought. Yet there are not droves and droves of people dying from strange fungal pneumonias and strange skin cancers.... That only happened in the 80s. It doesn&#39;t happen anymore. I think HIV probably was the industry created to hide what really killed those people in the early 80s. It would explain why Los Alamos National Laboratory.... the weapons research lab of the US government..... is so intimately connected with this disease.... it explains why your reference for what constitutes an HIV genome comes solely from this lab.... it explains why your only source of HIV for research purposes is the NIH HIV Reagents program. They give you the HIV reagents for use with their HIV test kits. DUH?! C&#39;mon people, this is pretty obviously snake oil.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course that doesn&#39;t happen anymore: HAART therapy was invented in the mid-90s... Most of people are diagnosed well before developing any symptoms.</p>

<p>However, for those like me who are diagnosed only when they start to develop AIDS (the immunodeficiency syndrome), the weird infections do appear, and sometimes are mortal. In 2010 I had pneumocystosis - caused by a micobacterium wich is normally harmless - and I know of at leat one other person in my social circle who died of JC virus, also in a case of late diagnosis.</p>

<p>If you survive those problems, though, HAART therapy drops the virus count to nearly indetectable levels and the CD4 cells quick back to appreciable levels. No more weird infections then.</p>

<p>You are right, just rechecked it. Hey, I am not a doctor and it was two years ago.</p>

<p>No drug use, unless you consider alcohool (no abuse, occasional drinks) and cigarretes (no chain-smoking, actually I often take a week to end a pack). So you believe in the &quot;drugs cause AIDS&quot; theory? Man, I know people that don&#39;t even drink and had it...</p>

<p>I always was (and I am) very promiscuous, but wouldn&#39;t that in fact be an anecdotal evidence <em>in favor</em> of HIV causing AIDS?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, yes, by the way I just remembered a study from the mid 2000s showing that HIV got less virulent/damaging over time, so that could also help explaining why the infections got less common/severe over time. But you don&#39;t have to discard HIV as a cause because of that - in fact, most new diseases get less damaging over time because that actually increases the chances of the pathogen for surviving and thriving in new hosts. This has hapenned with syphilis, for instance, which was really horrible centuries ago and nowadays is even kind of assymptomatic in a sizeable portion of the hosts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t think any single one of these things causes AIDS... i do think the collective of them has an effect of stressing ones immune system to the point where they will test positive to HIV tests or catch one of the <a href="http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/cjtestfp.htm">cofactors known to cause false positives</a>.  Look its your life, your body, your decision...  but the evidence for the counter is pretty compelling.... </p>

<p>promiscuity would actually lend you to the conclusion that you caught a lot of known pathogens through body fluids and got sick through the collective effect of that... not that theres an unproven, elusive microscopic agent causing your immune system to fail 10 years after introduction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But other DST pathogens that I caught - and IIRC there are not many of them - were actually diagnosed and treated over time, years before the 2010 event. Also, other DSTs were far more prevalent in the population before (for instance) antibiotics - why there wasn&#39;t AIDS then?</p>

<p>Ah, yes, there are other venues for being exposed to lots of pathogens and getting a depressed immune system. Wouldn&#39;t for instance doctors/nurses, workers at sewer plants, workers in the nuclear industry, etc, etc, be at higher risk of developing AIDS.</p>

<p>Finally, if you think that HIV doesn&#39;t cause it, how do you explain HAART therapy working so incredibly well? Before I was diagnosed, I suffered for months with strange intestinal problems (that the doctors were pretty lousy at diagnose correctly, nowadays apparently AIDS is the last thing that they think of) until having the pneumocistosis and other characteristic infections (for instance an aggressive herpes attack). Then, one month after starting the HAART therapy, all those problems disappeared magically and I started to regain weight. (I was a beefcake before and became a stick man after loosing 30 pounds. Now I am a slightly overweight beefcake - 6 feet x 180 pounds.) </p>

<p>So, if you think that HIV is not the cause, then you think that HAART is not what it is said to be?</p>

<p>I hope that I am not being rude by asking all of that, I am just trying to understand your POV. To be sincere I don&#39;t think that I will get convinced of your theory :), but I try at least to be open to other explanations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dunno. ima say your lifestyle is chronically infecting you with a lot of different diseases..... and HAART combats them all very generally (by interfering with their ability to reproduce). Im saying the evidence that supports there is a mystical agent responsible for this known as HIV is not solid scientifically and has significant signs of fraud everywhere you look around it. </p>

<p>Its perfectly plausible that your lifestyle leads to being chronically infected with a host of other pathogens, and HAART is a very good general combatant of them. We don&#39;t need a mystical virus known as HIV for that to be true. </p>

<p>Anyways, I respect your ability to choose your health care and wish you best of luck. In any event, the days when their medications were responsible for killing you seem to have come to an end. Just be thankful you didn&#39;t catch the disease when they told you that a high dose of AZT would solve it.... you&#39;d probably not be alive now. </p>

<p>me personally, after reviewing the evidence, it looks like a bunch of gay men were poisoned by a vaccination program in the late 1970s... and they built up this industry around this &quot;virus&quot; to hide what they did. the thing that killed people in the 1980s.... that isn&#39;t around anymore... no one dies like that anymore.  droves of people are not getting weird skin cancers. they&#39;re not getting strange fungal pneumonias... they are healthy and testing positive to their bullshit test, for which they begin to take medications which in turn make them sick.

There is no verification of these numbers they generate, and the methods which they use to generate them are often terrible. One thing is for certain, people are not dying in DROVES from wasting, kaposi sarcoma, or PCP like they were in the early 1980s, here or in Africa.  There remains tons of untested cases according to their science, yet there is not a ton of people presenting with these symptoms.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>something certainly existed that killed a bunch of people rapidly in the early 1980s. Whether that was a new virus, or simply a bunch of old ones, or some kind of obscure reaction to a vaccination program, or the result of the high dose AZT treatment they were given.... I do not know.....I do know, however, there is nothing that is infecting people that is functioning like the virus they originally claimed to be fighting.  And it is this inconsistency, especially given the amount of money poured into this industry, and the amount of drugs they are responsible for pouring into third world countries in africa.... that we need to be looking into with a finer scope. </p>

<p>He also might not have known what specifically he had found in those autopsy samples but he knew it was different from control brains.

    <div class="md"><p>well ill leave it as an exercise to the reader to validate if that estimate&#39;s methodology...... which i reproduced below.... is an accurate or inaccurate estimation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calculation of Person-Years Lost/AIDS Patients</p>

<p>The authors first estimated the number of persons who were eligible to receive ARV treatment by obtaining the number of deaths from AIDS in South Africa for the period 2000-2005 from UNAIDS. Patients with AIDS who died without getting treatment lost the entire average benefit of ARV therapy. Data regarding individuals who received ARV therapy in South Africa between 2000 and 2005 were obtained from the UNAIDS and WHO ‘‘3 by 5&#39; records (23% in 2005, less than 10% in 2004, 3% in 2003, and less than 3% for preceding years). The authors propose that South Africa could have started an ARV treatment program in 2000, covering not more than 5% of persons who needed therapy but ramping up the coverage as drugs became less expensive and more international resources became available to 50% coverage by 2005. This estimate is lower that the coverage achieved by both Botswana and Namibia. Then they estimated the average life-years that ARV therapy adds to patients with AIDS in Africa, based on primary studies, a meta-analysis, and a comparison with developed countries. The authors calculated that 2.2 million person-years were lost in South Africa from 2000 to 2005 by not implementing a feasible and timely ARV treatment program.</p>

<p>Calculation of Person-Years Lost/Mother-to-Child Transmission Prevention Failure</p>

<p>The authors estimated the number of children infected with HIV through vertical transmission, using data from the Actuarial Society of South Africa AIDS and Demographic Model and reducing that number to account for HIV prevalence in South Africa with population growth in mind. They estimated mother-to-child transmission prevention coverage using data from the PMTCT Task Team in South Africa and the Health Systems Trust. The research team assumed that it was feasible for South Africa to start a mother-to-child transmission prevention program in 2000, given that nevirapine was available for free, and estimated a ramping up to about 55% coverage by 2005. This estimate is less than the coverage achieved by both Namibia and Botswana. They used the HIV Network for Prevention Trials 012 trial, which showed that single-dose nevirapine decreased transmission by 47% compared with oral ZDV in a breastfeeding population. To estimate the person-years lost per case of HIV transmitted, the authors assumed a life expectancy of 48 years and then subtracted the average survival of an HIV-infected baby without ARV treatment. The authors estimated that 1.6 million person-years were lost in South Africa from 2000 to 2005 by not implementing a mother-to-child transmission prophylaxis program using nevirapine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having reviewed this methodology I consider it relatively sound. They probably under estimate the amount of improvement that could have been achieved in South Africa, but they admit this. The only way this estimate could be severely mistaken is if you assume that AIDS was not the causative factor in the deaths they are reporting on or that ARV is not actually effective; the latter is not supported by their analagous data from Namibia, Botswana, and developed nations that they reference; the former is unlikely to have resulted in a very dramatic overestimation.</p>

<p>Id like to see this calculation. Help? I dont see where they are getting this value... where are the primary studies and meta analysis... where is the comparison to developed countries?  did they account for the fact that living in africa is inherently more dangerous than developed nations and control for it in their calculations? </p>

<p><em>AIDS denialists will also demand even more specific evidence, only to change the demand once the evidence is produced. One example of this “pushing back the goalpost” technique was the former Sunday Times journalist and prominent AIDS denier Neville Hodgkinson’s claim that HIV tests are invalid because HIV has never been isolated. When scientists provided evidence that HIV has been isolated, the demand changed; Hodgkinson argued that the isolated virus was “impure”. Denialists now demand that the virus be isolated in “pure form”, that is uncontaminated by proteins. The demand for a pure virus devoid of cellular proteins is impossible to meet as it defies the biological nature of viruses. Such shifting of the grounds of debate allows denialists to claim that they are the ones following the evidence, and it is the AIDS establishment – an alliance of careerist researchers and greedy drugs companies – who are propagating pseudoscience.</em></p>

<p><em>In the 1980s legitimate scientists disagreed about AIDS. For AIDS deniers, everything old is new again. AIDS denialists rely on selected research findings from the days when not much was known about AIDS. The first tests for HIV antibodies were less reliable than current testing technologies. There were early debates about what caused AIDS and good ideas that turned out to be dead ends. The drug AZT was prescribed in massive and often toxic doses. But none of this is true any more. Though there remain many debates in medical science about how HIV causes AIDS, there is no longer a debate about whether HIV causes AIDS. Unfortunately, outdated scientific literature is not purged when new knowledge emerges. AIDS deniers use this information to create the illusion of a live debate. Denialists select old findings that support their flawed logic because they have no evidence of their own. Cherrypicking is another favourite rhetorical technique of denialists. This involves selecting a lone scientific finding, presenting the results out of context, and deploying it as evidence for their own conclusions.</em></p>

<p>It is a fallacy that you think education gives you the ability to comprehend their arguments. There are educated virologist, biologists, pathologists, chemists, etc., <a href="http://www.sparks-of-light.org/LetterToScience-Public.pdf">including this letter to Science magazine signed by over 30 scientists</a> calling for the withdraw of these papers...

<p>Looking at the letter you referenced, it only calls into question the initial article by Gallo, which was roundly criticized for stealing data from the French researchers who did successfully and unambiguously show the existence of a virus, which they called LAV, which we now identify as HIV.

<p>Right. That&#39;s the fraud that he was officially on the hook for. But his edits show that he should have been on the hook for a lot more including outright making up key components of the paper up 2 weeks before it was published without evidence. He changed the conclusion without any evidence. </p>

<p>Dude you have no evidence suggesting the more than 30 signatories are poorly regarded.

There is no doubt the same guys who were in charge of it when they suggested high dose AZT responsible for killing millions are still in charge of it today. Specific questions about the process used in the isolation and purification of the virus around the 1.16 density gradient band have not been answered, and the answers to these questions are CRUCIAL in determining if what they are looking at is random cellular crap or actually an infectious agent.  Specific questions about the non specificity of p24 detection in samples as representing a positive test have NEVER BEEN ANSWERED by these people. They always respond with epidemiological studies of questionable integrity.... never anything that specifically addresses the science of the methods they are using. The public needs to know why. </p>

<p>There are of course many regulatory bodies for the pharmaceutical industry, here in Australia we have the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is slightly more thorough than the US FDA. </p>

<p>Its been the same set of people since the beginning. It is not worldwide. You know where you get HIV to do research on? The NIH. There is only one source. You get it from the NIH HIV Reagents program. And you test samples for the presence of HIV, using ELISA and Western Blot tests provided to you by the NIH who more than likely gave you a grant to do the research so they know exactly what you will be doing with their virus. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fearoftheinvisible.com/fraud-in-key-hiv-research-background">Please point me to the independent verification of the existence of HIV.

<p>And yes the same people that were in charge of this industry in 1984 are in charge of it today: </p>

<p>This claim is so bizarre and misguided that it is hard to think of how to discuss it. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/infectious-diseases/poverty-diseases/projects/39_en.htm">Europe has it&#39;s own reagent group</a>, this was found with a cursory google, my impression is that there is a far wider variety of HIV reagent manufacturers all throughout the world, although I feel this is enough to categorically disprove your claim that the NIH is the only source of HIV samples. </p>

<p>There are a large number of independent manufacturers of HIV ELISA, western blot and PCR kits, <a href="http://www.zeptometrix.com/elisas.htm">here&#39;s a company that sells it&#39;s own ELISA kit</a>, one of many. If I wanted to, I could make my own HIV ELISA with the skills I learnt in my final year practical immunology labs. Throughout the world there are a large number of research funding bodies, so a lot of non-NIH research is being done. This idea of a centralized conspiracy is really way out of left field and I hope you&#39;ll desist with it.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve already indicated, and as you should well be aware, the research by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Montagnier">Luc_Montagnier et al</a> predated Gallo et al, ad independently verified the existence of HIV, which has also been independently shown to exist innumerable times since.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Thats not how this works. </p>

<p>HIV has a long latency period and even then, if these people still went untested, then you&#39;d see more people presented with diseases that they&#39;d normally be shielded from.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, with a large campaign, even with people who don&#39;t protect themselves, to get regular check ups, we intervene with aids far sooner than we would have in the 80s. </p>

<p>Even further, advances in drugs and immunizations and treatments since then have allowed us to prevent susceptibility to HIV associated diseases since then...including respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>People still do present with these diseases...<strong><em>BUT</em></strong> since people know more about AIDS than ever before people are getting checkups more frequently than before and intervening long before you&#39;d see major cases of people falling prey to these things as we saw in the past when NO ONE would go to the doctor for ANYTHING. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my reasoning:</p>

<p>Some people die precipitously of previously harmless pathogens in what we call AIDS, they test positive for HIV. Other individuals exposed to these people by blood or sex also start to test positive for HIV; many of them also develop AIDS. People exposed to those HIV positive people who don&#39;t have AIDS also begin to test positive for HIV and many of these people develop AIDS.</p>

<p>People who have developed AIDS have very low CD4 counts and also have high blood levels of HIV. We have drugs which reduce HIV levels in patients and this causes an increase in CD4 level in these patients, which coincides in a reduction of their symptoms, despite their symptoms being apparently due to pathogens not affected by these drugs.</p>

<p>So even if there were some inconsistencies in the original HIV science; I see no reason, given the observations above and the evidence you presented not to accept that there is a transmissible immunodeficiency causing organism which we call HIV which can be treated but not cured with the available anti-retrovirals.</p>

<p>&quot;The chronic nature of the disease allows the use of serologic tests to document HIV infection as supplemented by genomic detection and quantification using PCR-related techniques. Unfortunately, serologic test cannot identify recently infected people. HIV is very difficult to grow in tissue culture, and virus isolation is not performed. Recent infection or late-stage disease is indicated by the presence of large quantities of viral RNA in blood samples, the p24 viral antigen, or the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Viral RNA in blood can be detected by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, and related methods. Blood levels of viral RNA are also useful as a monitor for the success of antiviral drug therapy. &quot;</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cv3xiLwQ8dwC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=medical+microbiology+murray+6th+edition&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=2qfDUKTLDOnj0gH48oGADA&amp;amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=HIV&amp;amp;f=false">Murray&#39;s</a> Medical Microbiology PCR technology and serology using ELISA&#39;s and Western blots can be used in the diagnosing of HIV. However there are apparent weaknesses and strengths with each test(i.e using serology and having to wait for antibodies to develop).</p>

<p>But all it says it that Gallo took credit for discovering AIDS and the test for it, NOT that AIDS isn&#39;t caused by HIV. That was never in question. Who the credit should go to was the only issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The subreddit itself? Nah. Most conspiracies here are actually quite entertaining. Even the antisemites and holocaust deniers that regularly rear their ugly heads here are ultimately harmless (at least I&#39;m pretty sure that they&#39;re either not deranged enough or too incompetent to start any pogroms).</p>

<p>But AIDS/HIV denial (and related topics, e.g. &quot;alternative&quot; medicine for cancer) is a different beast altogether. Regardless of whether it&#39;s for profiteering off vulnerable people or out of a genuine but horrifically misguided sense of goodwill, this is absolutely harmful and dangerous. People are dying because they refuse lifesaving medicine, and people like you are to blame.</p>

<p>You disgust me. You have no credentials whatsoever and all your &quot;knowledge&quot; comes from cherry-picking wrong or obsolete internet articles, yet you dare to purport yourself as more knowledgeable than the entire medical community and to give harmful medical advice.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, this post in particular will probably not change anyone&#39;s mind for the worse, especially after all the dissent offered here. </p>

<p>But imagine you just got a HIV positive diagnosis and, devastated as you&#39;d be, turn to the internet to get your bearings. You&#39;ll find posts like his, which at a glance seem well though out, researched, sourced, and filled with appropriate terminology. And perhaps most importantly, he&#39;s telling you what you&#39;d like to hear. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not this guy alone, it&#39;s an entire industry of idiots who created this bizarre parallel world and give the appearance of legitimate controversy around HIV/AIDS when there is none. I think it&#39;s important to make it unequivocally clear that this guy is a loon who has no idea what he&#39;s talking about, and that even on a conspiracy forum everyone calls him out for his bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but the reason he was found guilty isn&#39;t the whole story of the fraud found in that original research. He got off the hook for a much greater fraud. Which is kinda what i write about in the original post. Giving specific examples of that fraud. No division fallacy required.  Im not cherry picking shit. I read the paper. I read the edits. The edits make it very clear he is fabricating the shit out of that paper. A lot more than misrepresenting he used Luc Montagnier&#39;s samples. Thats all you need people.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>The ONLY thing Gallo did wrong was take credit for the discovery of HIV...but HIV causing AIDS has been long supported. </p>

<p>The question wasn&#39;t if HIV exists or if it causes AIDS. The only thing in question was who gets credit for it: The USA or the French. </p>

<p>Or they did some more research and found he was right. BTW, HHS didn&#39;t file the charge. It was ORI and NIH.
In order to say politics were involved, you&#39;d need to publish some transcripts of politicians being involved. Of which, you have presented none.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave very specific example of him committing fraud in his own hand. Perhaps you need to reread it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read it and you cherry picked that quote. You conviently left out how he put in sources for his claim.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the actual quote:
&quot;&quot;Although patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS are often chronically infected with cytomegalovirus (7) and hepatits B virus (8), for various reasons these appear to be opportunistic or coincidental infections.&quot;</p>

<p>You also fail to mention how later in the paper he shows the results of Essex and Lee,which show that patients diagnosed with AIDS had weakened immune systems and whose blood samples showed no signs of any other HTLV (the only type of virus found to weaken immune systems at the time) known at the time. Opportunistic infections happen when the immune system is weak.</p>

<p>Even if your quote does show some merit, thinking that one quote disproves the entirety of Gallo&#39;s paper would be a &quot;fallacy&quot; fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The source is Janine Roberts interview with Larry Stewart, the Secret Service agent who had led their investigation into Robert Gallo&#39;s HIV research. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no supporting evidence for Ms. Roberts claims that Larry Stewart agreed with her OR that he even received a phone call from her.</p>

<p>Further, she has yet to publish a transcript of her conversation with Stewart. Evidence or it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To what specifically are you referring? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Montagnier was the co-discoverer of HIV. Way not to do research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How much more evidence do you need?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amount of reliable evidence you have given = Number of unicorns in existence</p>

<p>Number of unicorns in existence = 0</p>

<p>Use transitive property to figure it out</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think its surprising that our doctors were duped.... they have put a lot of effort into making a semi coherent argument and violently stifling dissent.... going as far as to ruin peoples careers who question them.   This is a very clever scheme.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><em>hey should know when they present with those illnesses.... like they did in the 1980s...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Thats not how this works. </p>

<p>HIV has a long latency period and even then, if these people still went untested, then you&#39;d see more people presented with diseases that they&#39;d normally be shielded from.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, with a large campaign, even with people who don&#39;t protect themselves, to get regular check ups, we intervene with aids far sooner than we would have in the 80s. </p>

<p>Even further, advances in drugs and immunizations and treatments since then have allowed us to prevent susceptibility to HIV associated diseases since then...including respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>People still do present with these diseases...<strong><em>BUT</em></strong> since people know more about AIDS than ever before people are getting checkups more frequently than before and intervening long before you&#39;d see major cases of people falling prey to these things as we saw in the past when NO ONE would go to the doctor for ANYTHING. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look who i am or where i am from is unimportant. we both know thats a very convincing argument for fraud that i reiterated in my post and it has been swept under the rug for a reason. US Tax payers continue to pay billions to this industry for which there is no REGULATORY body. These people are not answering to anyone, yet they are completely funded by the public&#39;s funds, and selling the public drugs and tests for which there are some very serious scientific questions brought up that they have deflected and never answered directly. There is no doubt the same guys who were in charge of it when they suggested high dose AZT responsible for killing millions are still in charge of it today. Specific questions about the process used in the isolation and purification of the virus around the 1.16 density gradient band have not been answered, and the answers to these questions are CRUCIAL in determining if what they are looking at is random cellular crap or actually an infectious agent.  Specific questions about the non specificity of p24 detection in samples as representing a positive test have NEVER BEEN ANSWERED by these people. They always respond with epidemiological studies of questionable integrity.... never anything that specifically addresses the science of the methods they are using. The public needs to know why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol he refuted all of Bryans arguments. I&#39;m definitley not agreeing with this guy but I can see that he was smart and knew waaay too much for me to conclusivey say he&#39;s wrong. Its like arguing with a butcher about meat. He had evidence a good backround and lost a lot because of it.</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m NOT agreeing with the guy but why did you think he was full of shit?</p>
