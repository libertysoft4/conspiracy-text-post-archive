    <div class="md"><p>Several months ago I was sitting in my home alone. All of the sudden I hear what sounded like (and felt like) a car crashed into my house. A loud crashing sound and it shook my entire house. There was a metallic nature to the sound and that is why I was thinking it was a car. I went out the front door expecting to see a crashed car or truck... nothing.  Then neighbors start coming outside too. They had the same experience as me. I called the gas company to see if there had been any explosions. They sent someone out to check for leaks but they knew of nothing. I called the sheriff dept but they just took some info from me and sounded apprehensive.</p>

<p>I have no clue what it was.</p>

Talked to my parents as well as housemates who also felt it, questioned whether it was an earthquake, however, it was such a short single burst I&#39;ve never felt an earthquake like it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been through many earthquakes, including the largest one I experienced in 93.  This wasn&#39;t the same, it wasn&#39;t sustained, no after-shocks, just one loud noise and single shake of my surroundings.  Definitely a curious anomaly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here, I live in Vegas and one afternoon I was home alone, probably on Reddit, and I heard (and felt) the loudest &quot;boom&quot; ever. I ran outside looked at the house, looked up and down the street, and called my roommate (who was at work) and asked if he had heard it, he didn&#39;t. To this day I have no idea what it was, </p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>Unexplained, kinda weird.</p></li>
<li><p>1 person called it in, people in comments confirm. Not at all as concerning or strange as #1 since it wasn&#39;t widely heard. Likely isolated, small incident and people online commenting are just idiots (if they heard it, why didn&#39;t they call it in, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Confirmed cause, which is pretty believable (Lockheed testing jets)</p></li>
<li><p>People saw actual, physical explosion. Whether it was real or what the cause was is irrelevant, as it doesn&#39;t fit the whole &quot;loud noises coming from the earth&quot; theory. </p></li>
<li><p>Unknown, but doesn&#39;t seem as sketchy as #1 as it was a single boom.</p></li>
<li><p>Kind of sketchy, but so is the alleged evidence. If the road/driveways are cracked, where are the photos? How was anything able to do that without registering on earthquake/seismology equipment? Also, Air Force base is nearby and they&#39;ve been running drills, which is likely the explanation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, really, #1 was the only one that really sticks out as unexplainable and concerning, but it should only be concerning if you live there. These &quot;loud noises&quot; and &quot;boom&quot; conspiracies have been around for a couple years now, they pop up all the time and they always turn out to be bullshit. So yeah, I still think &quot;nut*n&quot; is up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just found this comment on the Rhode Island story:</p>

<p>At exactly 05.13 am here in Luton 31 miles North of London England, both myself and my partner heard an explosion on Tuesday 4th December. On arriving at work (office in Luton town Centre with panoramic views) at 05.45am I asked my work colleague if he heard any strange sounds and he confirmed that he had heard an explosion around 05.15 am. He explained that he could not determine the cause having scoured the area from the windows. I had done the same but to no avail. No reports via media have been made in relation to others hearing an explosion in either the Luton area or any other part of the country yet three of us Luton residents did hear an explosion! 05.13am here in England would have been 00.13am your local New York City area time, and taking into account both events occured thousands of miles apart and about an hour apart, I wonder if these explosion sounds are linked? Those folk in Narragansett Bay heard it and a few folk in Luton here in England heard an explosion sound too! Vert strange. </p>
