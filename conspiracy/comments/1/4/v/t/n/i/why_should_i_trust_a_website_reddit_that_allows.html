        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The system set up seems to support rigging and emotional manipulation. Even though other websites do not allow &quot;the cream to rise to the top&quot; through an upvote/downvote system, they do allow an even playing field for all ideas. So how does this work, with its ingrained voting system, which through all methods has been proven to be easily rigged? I like the idea of a place where the &quot;best of the best&quot; news, against the mainstream, can easily be the most prevalent. But in method, this system is a prey for the lazy and less discerning. Unless I&#39;m wrong. What should I know about the reddit system, and how it applies to supporting news (and not imgur sentiments) so against the mainstream and government-supported, as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should be?</p>

<p>Also true votes are never shown on anything voted higher than a certain threshold, the vote totals you see are completely made up. For instance there wasn&#39;t really 4000 downvotes on this post. And if you&#39;re on an IP or account group that&#39;s considered vote gamers, you&#39;ll see a different vote count than an IP address/block that isn&#39;t on that list.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why mods and admins have to sometimes pull popular posts/comments out of the spam filter, because the voting pattern was irregular enough to make it come up as spam.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Damn with my Redditology 301 I went into below, i&#39;m kind of bummed that this post will never get past /new/, at least i can save this post to link to the next time I have to explain why reddit&#39;s voting algorithms aren&#39;t easily gamed on the macro level, micro level of a few votes here or there is still doable but won&#39;t make a big impact.  The admins probably aren&#39;t worried about a person getting a few friends to upvote their posts/comments.</p>

<p>Well according to this: <a href="http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588">http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588</a>, and other links on that page, it doesn&#39;t. Unless I&#39;m missing something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are the open source bits.  The admins have talked about their anti-gaming mechanisms a little bit, and that it&#39;s something they won&#39;t make open source, or be very specific about, since the second they did any scammer/gamer could work around it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s their &quot;special sauce&quot;.  They&#39;re also always tweeking it based on trends they see.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not perfect, if the NSA wanted to game a few posts on reddit, they could do it.  But the time investment, and cost of setting up all these innocent unconnected accounts would prevent regular gaming.  And making it even more difficult for a nobody group to figure it out.</p>

<p>Like if you bought up a botnet, and set up a variety of accounts and gave them some history, after a few games, your botnet and all the accounts you worked on will be pretty much salted.</p>

<p>For example, i tried to game a few posts with multiple accounts on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  My votes on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> don&#39;t affect things in the new queue anymore. It says they do, but when i look at them on a remote computer that&#39;s never touched reddit (i have a lot of servers for work) the vote count never changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean, I&#39;m not exactly a programmer... my bad.</p>

<p>But the overall system does allow poplular sentiments to rise, by its very nature. And under typical conspiratorial ideas, the popular sentiment has been subverted (we can disagree on this fact, but on what follows, we need the less popular to have equal voice), so we cannot trust this system to run a subreddit which calls itself <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. That&#39;s part of my reasoning for posting this, at least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, I didn&#39;t mean to seem like I was arguing, just explaining that there&#39;s a a lot that the admins don&#39;t talk about.  I&#39;ve been on here for about 4 years under various accounts (you don&#39;t start with hatesredditors as a username after all) and the admins used to be a lot more open about things, especially when it was digg&#39;s nerdy little brother that only got 1/10th the traffic.</p>

<p>Even then they weren&#39;t open about what the mechanisms were, but it was something that interested me so i got enough bits to understand a few things they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>If a bunch of zero day accounts, or accounts that have zero karma start upvoting a random post, that post is going to be flagged internally.  The only way to game the system is to have a few hundred well established accounts from unrelated IP addresses (better not even be in the same block)</p>

<p>Another easy sign, they track if you&#39;re a &quot;knight of new&quot; (by virtue of the fact that you can get a trophy if you are a good new queue voter), if a bunch of well established accounts that were never &quot;knight of new&quot; before start upvoting a new topic, again, that flags and will probably get flagged as spam.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty good system.  It&#39;s not impossible to game once or twice, but even if you do game it, that post better have some merit, because once the general reddit population sees it, if they don&#39;t approve, they&#39;ll downvote it hard once it starts getting to the top 10 spot of whatever subreddit they submitted it to.  Your botnet then needs to be able to fight a wave of downvotes from legitimate users.</p>

<p>Regarding the bit about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, well that sounds more like a sociological question rather than a technological one.  That&#39;s kinda out of my wheel house.  But if you want to see all the posts just check out the /new/ queue of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, there&#39;s only about 50 posts per day, and it&#39;s free of the voting system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your interest.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt the system is well-set, I mean, a well set bureaucracy is the best conspiracy isn&#39;t it? And there are few people on this website who even consider the new queue, aside from the first some odd number. So again, yes, I guess it is a sociological question, but in the sense that the internet is a very important source of what the sociological future holds, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, by its very association with reddit&#39;s system, does not exactly hold the best position on these concerns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it depends on the concerns.  I mean the only people seeing the things posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are people who are subscribed to the subreddit. The same issues effect every forum, voting system or not.</p>

<p>But with something as big as reddit you need a voting system where peers help clear out the signal to noise ratio.</p>

<p>If you want reddit to function like regular forums you have that option too.  Just change from searching by &quot;hot&quot; to reading everything in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/new/">/r/conspiracy/new/</a>, and sort all comments by new, then its essentially the same as a traditional forum, just with a threaded comment system.</p>

<p>Also in your settings, set your downvote comment threshold to -999, then you don&#39;t even have to worry about comments being suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Additionally there are methods of tracking PCs that go far beyond IPs.  They take into account a ton of other info that your browser is sending beyond it&#39;s header, and can effectively ban or shadow block your votes.</p>

<p>But essentially a regular internet user has a semi-unique fingerprint.</p>

<p>I really wish i could find the link for you, I was looking it up when i was having issues with users.  Every home PC i ran against it was unique among the few million browsers they had on record.</p>

<p>It was way too complicated for me to figure out, as an overworked sysadmin, and the problem wasn&#39;t widespread enough to take such drastic steps, but reddit has a lot of very passionate people who offer their help for free.  And if the voting platform is compromised it basically ruins the site.</p>

<p>For instance Randall Moore (of XKCD fame) helped to build the &quot;best&quot; sorting mechanism on Reddit, and helped with R9K on 4chan, and has probably been involved in a lot more anti-gaming mechanisms on here, along with other less known, but possibly more knowledgeable internet gurus. </p>

<p>So long story short, you can easily game a few votes, but once you start gaming en-masse you&#39;re going to be playing a losing game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your premise. On some subreddits such as SRS there are so many trolls that the explanation seems to be that Reddit tolerates multiple accounts. Also when you see a subreddits and only the worst posts are up voted you know that something is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that Reddit is not the best place for anything, I do think that this page still holds great importance, in that it provides a good amount of information on the conspiracy theories, that people agree to be more than just theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, I didn&#39;t mean to seem like I was arguing, just explaining that there&#39;s a a lot that the admins don&#39;t talk about.  I&#39;ve been on here for about 4 years under various accounts (you don&#39;t start with hatesredditors as a username after all) and the admins used to be a lot more open about things, especially when it was digg&#39;s nerdy little brother that only got 1/10th the traffic.</p>

<p>Even then they weren&#39;t open about what the mechanisms were, but it was something that interested me so i got enough bits to understand a few things they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>If a bunch of zero day accounts, or accounts that have zero karma start upvoting a random post, that post is going to be flagged internally.  The only way to game the system is to have a few hundred well established accounts from unrelated IP addresses (better not even be in the same block)</p>

<p>Another easy sign, they track if you&#39;re a &quot;knight of new&quot; (by virtue of the fact that you can get a trophy if you are a good new queue voter), if a bunch of well established accounts that were never &quot;knight of new&quot; before start upvoting a new topic, again, that flags and will probably get flagged as spam.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty good system.  It&#39;s not impossible to game once or twice, but even if you do game it, that post better have some merit, because once the general reddit population sees it, if they don&#39;t approve, they&#39;ll downvote it hard once it starts getting to the top 10 spot of whatever subreddit they submitted it to.  Your botnet then needs to be able to fight a wave of downvotes from legitimate users.</p>

<p>Regarding the bit about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, well that sounds more like a sociological question rather than a technological one.  That&#39;s kinda out of my wheel house.  But if you want to see all the posts just check out the /new/ queue of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, there&#39;s only about 50 posts per day, and it&#39;s free of the voting system.</p>
