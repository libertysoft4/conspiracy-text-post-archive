    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a speculative stretch.  If he had autism it is likely that he wasn&#39;t interested in social networking or other activities that may leave a trail online.  So many are willing to participate in these things because it makes them feel a part of something.  My experience is that children with autism either can&#39;t feel a part of something or are whole enough in themselves to not care.</p>

<p>Based in Woodbury, Connecticut for the past 19 years, The Best Solution, Inc. (<a href="http://www.thebestsolution.com">www.thebestsolution.com</a>), Microsoft Certified Partners, has moved to 450 Heritage Road in Southbury. Providers of financial support and solutions for companies throughout the United States, co-owners Kara Hermes and Richard Novia, Microsoft Certified Partners, collectively bring more than 50 years of combined extensive experience in sales, operations management, software and hardware solutions. “We help companies improve their operations,” stated Novia, “and get the most from every dollar they earn by offering controllership-level services.” Those services include financial and accounting system audits, training, technical and professional assistance with financial software products for mid to large-sized companies in the $5 to $100M in annual gross earnings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one doing that level of government work would advertise themselves primarily as a MCP.  Thats a desktop support company brag.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, Peter Lanza, Adam&#39;s father, was a partner in Ernst and Young Accounting/Tax business. In fact, he was a VP in this company as well as GE Financial Services... still is, for that matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much everyone that isn&#39;t a junior at a financial firm is a VP.  It really doesn&#39;t mean anything about his actual level in the company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, Mr. Novia is a big wheeler dealer in financial auditing and software tools now... and Peter Lanza is a big deal in GE Finance and Ernst and Young Tax Accounting (he&#39;s a partner there). So, the Tax Accountant&#39;s ex-wife is murdered and his disable son is dead... and the former head of security at the school system who is now a financial auditing software tools big shot... was a mentor-buddy to the Tax Accountant&#39;s disable son...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For extremely light definitions of &quot;big wheeler dealer&quot;  We so evidence he was part of anything more than a mom and pop support shop.</p>

<p>People are so desperate for this to be a conspiracy that they jump through all these stupid hoops and twist anything to fit their desired outcome.</p>
