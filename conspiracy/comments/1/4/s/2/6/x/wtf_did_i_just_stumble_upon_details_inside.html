        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT:  What is a Sayanim?  The main Wikipedia site deleted the term Sayanim from its files (surprise, surprise!).  Only the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayanim">French version is up</a>.  I passed <a href="http://oi58.tinypic.com/16bengo.jpg">the main description of it through Google Translate</a>, however.</p>

<p>..........................</p>

<p>Nearly a month ago, I posted the follwoing response to a Redditor who since deleted his/her name/account, so I have no idea who it was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was through doing a google search for syanim that I found <a href="http://blockyourid.com/%7Egbpprorg/judicial-inc/main_index.html">this</a>. What is this particular site? Are you familiar with it? It seems to have some really interesting information that I hadn&#39;t heard of before.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://blockyourid.com/%7Egbpprorg/judicial-inc/columbine_killers.htm">this</a>, for example, which I got from <a href="http://blockyourid.com/%7Egbpprorg/judicial-inc/Sayanim.htm">this</a> page here - this second link here having been literally the last entry on the page when I did <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sayanim&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">the initial google search for the word</a>. When I clicked on the second link and read a bit, I was like what the FUCK? Columbine had Israeli connections? What the fuck?</p>

<p>I read through some more areas of the website...and am a bit in a daze. It definitely seems to have r/conspiracy relevance, and I was actually going to make a separate link and post it, but - again - don&#39;t know what to make of the site yet.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I decided to email one of the moderators and ask for their opinion as to whether I should put it up as its own separate, stand alone post so that I could get some clarification on what exactly this link was all about, but since nearly a month has passed and I&#39;ve heard no response, I decided to post it up here all the same.  Some of the info seems to be pretty voluminous and has a LOT of data in it.  I&#39;m wondering how much of it is true because it seems to have some stuff I hadn&#39;t heard before, and some of the information really opens things up even more to me in terms of how bad things are.</p>

<p>Trying to get some discussion going as to some of the information in the link.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>These sayanim DO exist and these things DO happen every single day. Thanks for the post. </p>

<p>Edit: this memory just came flooding back: when Columbine happened I owned a Mac repair store in Boulder, CO. I had a customer/friend that was an Englewood, CO cop. We were talking about the incident and he brought this fact to light: he told me that some of the &quot;bombs&quot; had detonation systems on them that were NOT available in the US to ANYONE. Back then they were surmising that perhaps somebody who was active military had stole them since they were US in origin (I believe they were detonators?)</p>

<p>...and then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Who has access to AMERICAN munitions that would have gladly helped these sayanim?</p>

<p>IDF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HA! So yes they are but not a lot of them? Doesn&#39;t leave out the fact their are jewish black people out there. Sorry.. just because a person is a certain color doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t study whichever religion he chooses to follow. Oh and if the shooter were black.. the first thing that would of popped up in my head is the following &quot; Damn... somebody really pissed them off.&quot; Same thing i thought when i heard about the shooting we are talking about right now. Now I want to make  it clear that I wasn&#39;t making assumptions on their religion prior to  reading the article yesterday.  So sorry buddy,I&#39;m not assuming they are jewish because of their skin color. I&#39;m saying they are Jewish because they  followed the Lutheran Tradition observed some rituals in keeping with Klebold&#39;s maternal grandfather&#39;s Russian Jewish heritage. That is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently read the book &quot;Columbine&quot;, which is an exhaustive journalist investigation into the events that happened there, and also the lead up and fall out from it. It&#39;s an amazing read. I think that these claims posted here are outright bogus. The book debunks many of the myths associated with this incident, and I highly encourage OP and anyone else buying into this post to read it. There are many misconceptions about what happened at Columbine, and unfortunately many mistruths were taken by the wind of the media and spread to the masses.</p>

<p>The girl who &quot;said yes&quot;, for example.. didn&#39;t say anything before being shot and killed. Books have been written about this Christian martyr, and unfortunately the story has been debunked many times over. This is just one example of common misconceptions of Columbine.</p>

<p>It was a tragedy caused by two disturbed young men. Nothing more. Also, I saw a comment here about how the bombs in the school were military grade, and had &quot;complex detonators&quot;. This is simply untrue. None of the big bombs the boys brought in exploded because they were very shoddily made. They were essentially propane tanks with gasoline cans attached.</p>

<p>Do some research and clear up the myths. </p>

<p>Additionally - and to address this particular point with more clarity - you are, in fact, actually <em>wrong</em>.  It can definitely be said that the fact of the matter is that NOTHING is actually random.  It can be said that everything is planned and works according to a structured set of laws.  That structure and set of laws, however, just happens to be so vastly beyond your or my or any human comprehension that it <em>appears</em> &quot;absolutely random&quot; to our tiny, feeble minds.  They <em>appear</em> random.  They absolutely are not, however.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether things are or are NOT random, however, things <em>are</em> indeed whatever it is they are.  And you know what?  That doesn&#39;t really bother me at all one way or the other.  Why ever should it?  Why would you or anyone ever think that it actually WOULD bother me?  It&#39;s truly strange that you would make a statement like you made here.  It presumes things that you have really NO understanding about with regard to how I think or regarding anything I&#39;ve said in this thread.</p>

<p>Sorry that you dont like it, but I stand by my question.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not making a question.  You&#39;re making an assertion that is thinly veiled in a question form.  There&#39;s a difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is his thought process common?  Do more of you think this way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What thought process?  Respecting others before posting certain information that might actually be considerably damning to easily-offended types?  Hmmm.  I wouldn&#39;t know.  I personally would actually <em>hope</em> it&#39;s actually common, as I think respect is a very important thing to have in this world - especially if it&#39;s warranted.  Respect is something that should never be equated with fear or following the herd, and those that ignorantly miss this point are more likely to cause more harm then would ever otherwise be the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this thought process is considered normal - and Im the oddball for finding it strange</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, right off the bat, what you&#39;re doing here is trying to single yourself out as &quot;the oddball&quot; for <em>thinking</em> you&#39;re some sort of &quot;rebel&quot; or &quot;independent free thinker&quot;.  What, in reality, you have shown yourself to be is nothing more than someone who makes wrong assumptions and simply runs with those wrong assumptions in the opposite direction of what is actually true or the case.  You are very much <em>not</em> who and what you think you are thinking like this.</p>

<p>Believe me, I would <em>MUCH</em> rather be the type of person that is honorable and respectful about how I proceed with what I do and say before I do it so that if and WHEN I do it, I can do it with stick-to-it-tiveness and confidence and follow through with what I decide to do ALL THE WAY, rather than jump headlong into wrong assumptions (like you do) and look like a complete idiot as I do the equivalent of jumping headfirst into an empty concrete pool.</p>

<p>And yes.  You&#39;re right, however.  This world really and truly <em>is</em> fucked.  There really isn&#39;t hope for people like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol.  Your assumptions are pretty off-base.  You started with a wrong assumption and then simply ran with it, assuming you were right in the first place, and quickly ended up being more, and more, and more wrong with every word you typed in this response here.</p>

<p>You are apparently ignorant of just how rampant the ADL crybabies on Reddit in general and in this subreddit in particular are.  You are also entirely ignorant of the fact that I&#39;ve had a moderator warn me that the ADL was actually crying to him/her about certain other posts I&#39;ve made.</p>

<p>Regardless of how absolutely critical I am of Zionism or <em>any</em> way of being that is as world-raping as Zionism has shown itself to be, I do not wish to have or post incorrect information, and am not unwilling to double check information I find with a mod if necessary.</p>

<p>Given your response here, you would likely be utterly <em>shocked</em> out of your panties to find out just how anti-establishment and anti-<em>bad</em> authority I am.  You would be shocked to find just how many posts I often and continuously make stating that I&#39;m ready to strap on a big, armor-piercing bullet-shooting dildo and start ass-fucking TPTB with it.  Your thinking that there is any &quot;brainless following&quot; trend going on here is, again, simply ignorant and mistaken.  There&#39;s a difference between &quot;following&quot; and simply respecting the extent to which some information might effect others before posting it - which is what I was doing.</p>

<p>Regardless, the fact of the matter is that, in the end of the day - and REGARDLESS of the fact that I felt the information on here might be so damning that it might really offend and ruffle some feathers - I <em>still</em> decided to take it upon myself an post it <em>without</em> any feedback from whatever moderator I originally PMed.  Therefore, what does that tell you about your &quot;dependence on authority&quot; assertion you made?</p>

<p>Again, in the end of the day, you simply started off on a very mistaken foot, and proceeded down an even more mistaken path without even bothering to question just how wrong your initial assumption was.  It seems it is you and your thinking that is the one that really needs questioning and revamping - not mine - but oh well.</p>
