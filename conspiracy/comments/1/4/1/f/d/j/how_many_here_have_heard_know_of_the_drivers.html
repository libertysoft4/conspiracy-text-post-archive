        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I refer to the concept that within the United States of America, the driver&#39;s license is not required by the average citizen to drive their cars.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole community of people who fight these legal battles with quite a few different tactics. Basically ordinary citizens who research the laws, and fight the court battles without lawyers (representing themselves)</p>

<p>The general gist of the legal argument is that the ordinary driver&#39;s license is commercial in nature (meaning only really required for commercial drivers) and therefore the average &quot;Joe&quot; doesn&#39;t need one to get to and from work, the store, family, the bar, wherever.</p>

<p>I myself have joined in and have learned how to win in court (beaten 9 out of 11 traffic citations - one is still in appeals court).  I haven&#39;t renewed my license since it expired in 2008.  I love court argument and motion writing and I&#39;ve learned a LOT about law.  It&#39;s now one of my hobbies and I love spreading the word and seeing how people react when I tell them I &quot;drive&quot; without a license.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the SUPER short version of the argument:
The American Citizen has a right to travel.  The American Citizen has a right to own and use property in the way in which it was intended.  The American Citizen has a right to the use of the public roads.  Therefore the American Citizen has a right to use their property (cars) to travel (driving) on the public roads.  No law may infringe upon a right.  No law may turn a right into a privilege or charge a fee for the exercise of a right.  Therefore, no driver&#39;s license required.  Along with this comes all the traffic citation laws (they would only apply to commercial drivers as well)  And basically, if you don&#39;t cause damage or harm to someone else&#39;s property or person, you can drive however you want.  </p>

<p>I can back this up with actual law, and would be glad to point out the arguments, however I&#39;m from Texas and as such all specifics are Texas based.  BUT each state has basically the same laws, just worded slightly different.  As such, you can fight these things pretty much anywhere.  </p>

<p>I consider it a conspiracy because it affects the whole country and it unlawfully rakes in tons of money from people every year through the use of our legal system.  The insurance industry is heavily invested in keeping the traffic tickets flowing forth so that they can raise rates as well.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d really just like to know who all out there has heard of this and if so, what would it take to get you to fight your own court battles for the exercise of your rights (especially if it means once you win, you don&#39;t have to pay the tickets!)</p>

<p>And btw, I still do my best to drive safely, &#39;cause cars can kill your ass!</p>

<p><strong>TL,DR</strong> Driver&#39;s licenses are not required and all traffic tickets are just revenue schemes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your barely touching the root of a serious problem. This stems from the District of Colombia Organic act of 1871. Which declares AMERICA to be a corporation called The United States. The reason why we as UNITED STATES citizens are required to get a drivers license is because it is required under the regulations of THE UNITED STATES government. America and the US are 2 separate entities. This is also the reason the US Constitution is NOT a valid defense for a US citizen in the court of law (i can not think of the case to prove this as of right now) But you will not find an honest assertion of this here at r/conspiracy, you will be shunned and degraded because this is the true power behind our enslavement. </p>

<p>What the hell are you talking about?  People use Constitutional concepts to defend themselves in court all the time.  It happens thousands of times a day, all across the United States.  It&#39;s so common it has become a part of popular culture - the Miranda rights, &quot;Pleading the Fifth,&quot; etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does this have to do with the federal government?</p>

<p>This is an act that creates the government of the Disctrict of Columbia as a municipal corporation.  This would be the government of Marion Barry, et. al, not the U.S. Federal Government.</p>

<p>Town and city governments in the United States are regularly created as &quot;municpal corporations.&quot;  That&#39;s just what they&#39;re called, and it has nothing to do with an S-corp, C-corp, or LLC (corporations).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disinfo, whether borne out of a sincere belief to what one understands to be the truth, or out of a more nefarious nature.. is still disinfo. Plenty of people who are fed intentional disinfo sincerely believe it; does that make them deliberate liars?

<p>You took offense to his use of the term and then took offense to my pointing out there&#39;s two sides to that coin. I can only speak for me but no disrespect was intended. Lighten up a little.</p>

<p>Not too long ago I believed the Federal Reserve was, well, Federal. It is not. I believed the 16th Amendment was ratified and that legally I had to pay an income tax. It was not and I do not. </p>

<p>It is not out of the realm of possibility that through legaleze and incrementalism our courts have been constitutionally circumvented. I see compelling research and citing of different case studies toward that end but by reading through your various comments, you seem less than open minded, so I&#39;ll save us both the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. The caveat to the skeptic thing, to me, is that the &quot;theorists&quot; are the skeptics, while you seem to be toeing the official narratives. In that context they heavily embrace skepticism and you are doing the attacking- and often times, probably rightly so, one cannot generalize the vast amount of topics or merit of in this sub.</p>

<p>You may argue it&#39;s semantics, and this is not an attack on you, but I am subscribed to <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> and I am always hit by the irony that going with the official version of things is being skeptical. </p>

<p>I understand the frustration of people posting hour long vids as a response but on the other hand a number have been well worth watching. Bill Foust&#39;s vids were among those well worth it, IMO. I like to know why people think the things they do, if nothing else, but found pretty compelling stuff in regards to our courts being run under admiralty law and that the US was restructured as a corporation. These claims are not baseless, these are people citing law, court cases, indeed the very changing of our Declaration to all capital letters, switching &quot;for&quot; for &quot;of&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read through a lot of the freeman documentation and watched a few videos.  Most of the famous ones seem more intent on selling their books these days though.  It&#39;s interesting to read and see them find what they think are loopholes but they just don&#39;t ever seem to work for them.  All the &quot;victories&quot; I&#39;ve seen are empty at best.  So I&#39;d say at best you could say they are morally right, but practically wrong.</p>

<p>Central banking is another topic discussed here often.  If you look at the federal reserves purpose for what it is and not straight away as being evil it makes sense.  The government should not have to be focused on monetary policy.  They should be able to take any action they deem correct without worrying about what it will do to the dollar.  Thats why you need a separation there.</p>

<p>We are mostly all debt slaves(I don&#39;t consider myself one) but we are voluntary debt slaves.  We trade freedom for comfort and community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most do not see it as being straight away evil, much to the contrary they believe it is a federal entity. This is by design and entirely false. </p>

<p>If the Fed truly was a federally owned and controlled entity I might be able to see an argument such as you&#39;re making. But it&#39;s not, it&#39;s a private corporation that creates money out of nothing and then loans it to the US at interest, enabling massive debt and a century of warfare.</p>

<p>The debt literally can never be repaid as the interest has not been created yet. If you have done the faintest amount of research on this and still don&#39;t see a problem, I must say you are rather naive or really are a shill. Either way, good day, sir.</p>

<p>Administrative divisions of states are &quot;municipal corporations&quot; that exist as a result of action by the state legislature.</p>

<p>Since the District of Columbia is not a state, but a federal area under the Congress, Congress created the city government of Washington, D.C., in this act, in the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>er &quot;CORPORATE FOR MUNICIPAL PURPOSES&quot; just means creating a municipality, an area on the sub-state level that is given self-governance and legal rights in a certain area. Think city, town, township, village, etc.The idea is that it makes an area it&#39;s own legal corporation, being able to represent itself coopertatively in court. </p>

<p>Ever notice on road signs you see things like &quot;now entering unincorporated springfield&quot;? it means that while that land considers itself part of a township, they are not under the administrative authority of the local government, but rather the state government.</p>

<p>Read that, not the &quot;Under the laws of the state/country they are in&quot; part.  They were creating a new city to house the federal government but the federal government shouldn&#39;t be concerned with a cities operation so they created a local government at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand how municipalities work... or law for that matter. A municipality is a subdivision of a government, a district. Think about federalism and how it relates to state governments, it&#39;s similar on the local level, counties and towns have limited autonomity. </p>

<p>Not to offend, but you&#39;re very, very confused with the definitions of these terms and how they work in practice and even how authority in the US is subdivided. I&#39;d suggest this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States">wikipedia article</a> as a good jumping off point if you want to learn more about local government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And nothing has to be a corporation to represent himself in court</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A township, since it&#39;s not a state nor country does have to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_corporation#United_States">corporation</a>, that term is not strictly used in the sense of &quot;mcdonalds is a fast food corporation&quot;, to be able to bring and recieve legal representation.  </p>

<p>A corporation is simply a legal device to allow a group of people to represent themselves as one body.</p>

<p>Sub-governments under the states or federal governments don&#39;t just spontaniously sprout up, they must be incorporated as municipalities to be able to carry out legal functions, what&#39;s so hard to understand?</p>

<p>Charlie tells of his stance and his lawsuit in the &#39;70s against sixteen public officials, including Ronald Reagan- and all of their wives. He details his court wrangling in laymans terms, very entertaining. Suffice it to say, Charlie has not had a license in decades and <em>travels</em> unmolested.</p>

I don&#39;t have a SSC I just got a paper printed out from the social security office that confirmed I had a number. In order to get the actual card i needed 2 forms of ID which i didnt have.  I used the confirmation letter from the social security office and my expired license number to order my birth certificate. I was in Texas and requested the birth from Oregon.

I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re asking.  What does the judge usually say?  If I&#39;m feeling bold or obnoxious the judge will usually threaten me with contempt (The judge is the one person in the room everyone else is afraid of.  You have to realize that, and understand that the bailiff and prosecutor are deathly afraid of the judge). 
Of the 9 that I &quot;beat&quot;, the prosecution dropped the charges.  You won&#39;t really &quot;win&quot; in court unless you get the jury to decide in your favor.  Judges (generally) won&#39;t rule in your favor.</p>

<p>In Texas, the proof of everything you say is that <em>ALL TRAFFIC LAWS FALL UNDER THE TRANSPORTATION CODE</em></p>

<p><strong>Transportation</strong> is not defined anywhere in any legislation, so for it&#39;s legal meaning you default to an accepted legal dictionary.  Lets <strong>read what blacks law (6th edition) defines it as</strong>.</p>

<p>--<strong>TRANSPORTATION</strong> The movement of goods or persons
from one place to another, by a <strong>CARRIER</strong>. Interstate
Commerce Com&#39;n v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, 14 S.Ct.
1125, 38 L.Ed. 1047.</p>

<p><em>Interesting</em>, I wonder what a carrier is?</p>

<p>--<strong>CARRIER</strong> Individual or organization engaged in transporting
passengers or goods for hire.
&quot;Carrier&quot; means any person engaged in the transportation
of passengers or property by land, as a common,
contract, or private carrier, or freight forwarder as those
terms are used in the Interstate Commerce Act, as
amended, and officers, agents</p>

<p><strong>THIS IDEA HOLDS TRUE IN (to my knowledge) EVERY STATE</strong>, but with different wording.  The laws regulating traffic were originally meant to keep people from sacrificing safety for profit on public roadways</p>

Since we are arguing legal meanings, and referencing Transportation codes and such we default to a legal dictionary for the definition of Passenger </p>

<p>--<strong>Blacks Law 6th ed.</strong>
Passenger. In general, a person who gives compensation
to another for transportation. Shapiro v. Bookspan,
155 Cal.App.2d 353, 318 P.2d 123, 126. <em>The word
passenger has however various meanings, depending
upon the circumstances under which and the context in
which the word is used;</em> sometimes it is construed in a
restricted legal sense as referring to one who is being
carried by another for hire; on other occasions, the word
is interpreted as meaning any occupant of a vehicle
<strong>other than the person operating it</strong>. American Mercury
Ins. Co. v. Bifulco, 74 N.J.Super. 191, 181 A.2d 20, 22.
PASSENGER
The essential elements of &quot;passenger&quot; as opposed to
&quot;guest&quot; under guest statute are that driver must receive
some benefit sufficiently real, tangible, and substantial
to serve as the inducing cause of the transportation so as
to completely overshadow mere hospitality or friendship;
it may be easier to find compensation where the
trip has commercial or business flavor. Friedhoff v.
Engberg, 82 S.D. 522, 149 N.W.2d 759, 761, 762, 763.
A person whom a common carrier has contracted to
carry from one place to another, and has, in the course
of the performance of that contract, received under his
care either upon the means of conveyance, or at the
point of departure of that means of conveyance.
Passenger mile. In statistics of transportation, a unit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, have you sustained a head injury in the last few hours? I already posted the screen shot of you harassing me on youtube, the thread with you guys posting how to find my info is still on NLW. Your account and Green-light&#39;s account has been banned the days after you both posted in that (oh and Greenie kept on posting info about me in NLW). </p>

<p>You&#39;re a know racist with the inability to differentiate between the people of The Middle East and North Africa and always refer to them as &quot;brown&quot;. Greenie has been caught using images from Davidduke.com and Stormfont. Then there&#39;s CrackDuck (aka GhostofDusty) who is throwing around racial slurs will nilly. Oh yeah and all of you are holocaust deniers. </p>

<p>Every link on NLW leads to someone&#39;s post that you want down voted. Every comment on NLW is a crack or joke abou the poster. Nothign on the subreddit is of any value, least of all any comment from you. </p>

<p>So Cow, tell us how many pizzas you&#39;ve scammed this week. Why do you support child soldiers son? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t feel wrong it makes zero sense that anyone can require that you keep some arbitrary piece of ID up to date for the &quot;privilege&quot; of using the publicly funded roads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First misunderstand. The ID is evidence of agree to a contract to travel by car on the roads, the license agreement. You may still be a passenger without one but with it, you pay a fee and pass a test that helps fund the road for the former and proves you are capable of handling a motor vehicle for the later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having an expired license does nothing regarding my ability to drive, especially since I apparently have already demonstrated the aptitude required to obtain one in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still the first misunderstanding. You&#39;re failing to uphold the terms of your contract. Active motorist use the roads most, so active motorist pay an additional license fee for the privilege to use them. you can drive on what ever private road you want without one, don&#39;t worry. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All traffic citations where no property, or life was damaged are inherently unconstitutional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true, deterrence and precautionary citations are totally constitutional. You break part of the contract designed for the safety of other contract holders, you are penalized in hopes that you learn your lesson. No man&#39;s a island, especially not on an open public road. Yet another misunderstanding. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>140 Million is a drop in the bucket yes. But divide that up between all the citizens that are able/actively drive and you have an obscene amount per person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, it&#39;s a penalty for violating a statute, law, or code of conduct. you can avoid them by following the rules explained when you qualify for your license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life is dangerous, getting on a freeway with other multi-ton vehicles is a dangerous act by itself. When you get behind the wheel of a car, you know what is at risk. If you hurt others or their property you should be duly punished. And only then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So percuationary measures are immoral? That punishment should only happen when the proverbial blood has been shed? Just because a drunk driver didn&#39;t kill someone tonight he should be allowed to keep drunk driving without punishment since no damage was done? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to focus on that last drunk driving comment.  Because all the rest of it falls under the same basic principles that we are obviously never going to agree on.  To sum it up on my end &quot;No victim, No crime&quot;, on your end &quot;big daddy government knows best, shut up and pay your fines&quot;.</p>

<p>The limits imposed by the state for driving &quot;drunk&quot; by their definitions are usually way out of touch with reality.  in Texas the legal limit is .08.  It has been demonstrated that driving while drowsy is exponentially more dangerous than driving with a BAC of .08</p>

<p>Putting arbitrary limits on the BAC when every person reacts different is retarded.  I know several people who have had their lives damn near ruined for drinking a couple of beers at dinner and then getting stopped for expired tags or some such garbage, and having the cop assert that they were wasted based on the light smell of beer on their breath.</p>

<p><strong>People die on the roads every day due to negligence and idiocy, why would I go on a witch hunt after one particular group of idiots i.e. drunks</strong>.  Blood doesn&#39;t need to be spilled, if you are drunk and dent a fender the punishment should be great.  If you are .08 &quot;drunk&quot; and get pulled over for something completely unrelated (i.e. expired tags), why would it factor in at all? </p>

<p><strong>Riddle me this, should jaywalking be a fine/punishable offense?</strong></p>

<p>Again, if you have harmed no one, and damaged no property, it is near madness that an officer of the law should be able to fine you or restrict your right to travel.</p>

<p>right, if you are doing 80 during rush hour and narrowly missing other cars as you weave through gaps and the shoulder, that is cause for a stop as you are presenting yourself as a danger (unless it is a genuine emergency).  If you are doing 120 on an empty/lightly trafficked freeway, why would that be an issue?  An attentive driver is just as much of a threat to others at 55mph as he is 100mph</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying if you aren&#39;t presenting an immediate threat to others around you, no one should be &quot;going after you&quot; drunk, high, stupid, or tired.</p>

<p>I agree 100%, because you are endangering others directly.  But you know as well as I do that <strong>MANY</strong> cops don&#39;t see on the level regarding jaywalking.</p>

<p>I guess I should have stipulated earlier, doing something like walking out onto a fast moving freeway, or pointing a gun at someone aren&#39;t exactly &quot;victimless&quot;.  If you pointed a gun at me (even in jest), that constitutes a threat on my life and I could use lethal force against you and be legally (and morally) in the right.</p>

<p>If you walked onto a freeway, causing others to violently swerve to avoid you, this is endangering others.  I&#39;m not arguing this sort of thing shouldn&#39;t come with consequences.</p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing that situations where you can&#39;t even begin to make up an injured party (no license, speeding, no seat belts, tags etc), cannot be punishable offenses.  Because how in the hell is the officer nailing people doing 70 in a 65 on their way to work <strong>possibly keeping us safe?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It keeps people safe by enforcing the law. A limit needs to be drawn or else it&#39;s totally up to discretion (for example one person may believe that going 45mph is too fast while another may be comfortable going 90 in the same area). </p>

<p>A driver isn&#39;t omnipresent, they cannot see what may be on the road 2 miles away or what may happen, by not enforcing speed limits speeding is being encouraged. People don&#39;t usually think further than their nose, you cannot gaurentee that if left to their own descretions thousands of drivers would come to a rational conclusion. Because even an individual rational choice (driving faster when you know you can handle it) can produce irrational conclusions if multiplied. </p>

<p>Without broad enforcement with existent, but limited, wiggle room laws are useless. When they are enforced drivers take it into consideration when they speed up (&quot;I should be careful or I will get a ticket&quot;). Again the individual in society can only be fully responsible for their own actions.</p>

<p>If someone walking out onto a fast moving freeway or pointing a gun at you are not victimless even though no direct harm is done, why is reckless driving any different? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending reckless driving.  Doing 30 over the &quot;limit&quot; on an open road, and driving in such a way that you are endangering others are completely different situations.  &quot;reckless&quot; is a subjective term.  Pointing a deadly weapon at someone, or stepping in front of a moving vehicle cannot be considered anything BUT reckless.</p>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t need to convince me people can be shortsighted and bad drivers in general.  I understand that risk every time I get on the road.  But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that fining a citizen for traveling faster than the state thinks is ok, and other such &quot;crimes&quot; is a completely unconstitutional and morally detestable act. </p>

<p>And please don&#39;t even pretend like police don&#39;t abuse their ability to stop people for traffic violations in an effort to meet unofficial quotas, or to screen for drugs on a whim.</p>

<p>If someone isn&#39;t capable of traveling in their car in a safe and reasonable manner, inevitably they will either shape up or ship out.  But such is life.  So why make traveling so shitty for everyone to fight a losing battle?</p>

<p>There is a reason major roadways have many lanes, it&#39;s so the person thinking 45 is acceptable can stay on one side to let the people that think 90 is acceptable to pass on the left :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First you have to realize that you will never get a cop to understand your position (unless you have great cleavage!).  Save your fight for the court room.  It&#39;s the only place you&#39;ll have a chance.
Second, read the Texas State Constitution.  Pay attention to Article V section 12 and 22.<br/>
Also, realize that a citation is not a summons.  Texas likes to treat traffic tickets criminally.  As such, they are required to follow all of the rules of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CCP).  The CCP says that to get you into court, they have to first either have a warrant, or a summons.  And a summons is issued from a judge, not a cop or prosecutor.
But ULTIMATELY, you have to realize that all traffic laws are ADMINISTRATIVE in nature.  They fall under the Administrative Procedure Act, Texas Government Code 2001, and as such, the state fails to exhaust all remedies before proceeding to a judicial forum (the courtroom) and therefore violates your rights.<br/>
Oh, and be TIMELY.  File your paperwork on time.

<p>Texas Administrative Code
TITLE 43 TRANSPORTATION
PART 1 TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
CHAPTER 1 MANAGEMENT
SUBCHAPTER E PROCEDURES IN CONTESTED CASES
RULE §1.21 Scope and Purpose
The sections in this subchapter describe the procedures to be followed in contested cases arising under Government Code, Chapter 2001, with the exception of contested cases arising under Occupations Code, Chapter 2301, Sale or Lease of Motor Vehicles, or under Transportation Code, Chapter 503, Dealer&#39;s and Manufacturer&#39;s Vehicle License Plates, which are governed by 16 TAC Chapter 111. <strong>Except as provided in this subchapter, all contested cases shall be governed by the procedural rules of the State Office of Administrative Hearings.</strong></p>

<p>And...
TxDoT is considered a “state agency” pursuant TxGvC Chapter 2001, Administrative Procedure Act, Sec. 2001.003(7) </p>

<p>(7)  &quot;State agency&quot; means a state officer, board, commission, or department with statewide jurisdiction that makes rules or determines contested cases.  The term includes the State Office of Administrative Hearings for the purpose of determining contested cases. ** The term does not include:**
(A) a state agency wholly financed by federal money;
(B) the legislature;
<strong>(C) the courts;</strong></p>

<p>Pursuant TxGvC Sec. 2001.003(7)(C), traffic court is not a “state agency”, and is specifically excluded from having jurisdiction to hear any contested case regarding the Texas Transportation Code as any charge of allegedly violating said statutes is challenged and contested by me for the purpose of administrative review. (I write a letter contesting all tickets to the agency after getting them)</p>

<p>In short, if someone contests the agency&#39;s claim, then they are required to hold an administrative hearing.  Thus exhausting their administrative remedies.
As I said, I know it&#39;s late, but just in case you still wondered.  And for those that would like to see more details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>The rule you cited (Rule 1.21) does not mean that at all.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the rule (taken right from the Texas Secretary of State homepage):
<em>This subchapter describes the procedures to be followed in a contested case. The procedures in this subchapter may be used only if a statute provides that the matter may be the subject of a contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act (Government Code, Chapter 2001) or a department rule expressly provides for a hearing under this subchapter.</em>
<a href="http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;amp;app=9&amp;amp;p_dir=&amp;amp;p_rloc=&amp;amp;p_tloc=&amp;amp;p_ploc=&amp;amp;pg=1&amp;amp;p_tac=&amp;amp;ti=43&amp;amp;pt=1&amp;amp;ch=1&amp;amp;rl=21">Source</a></p>

<p>In other words, unless a specific statute (or a DMV rule) allows for an administrative hearing, these procedures and hearings do not apply.  Traffic statutes do not provide for administrative hearings.</p>

<p>In fact, Texas Statutes, V.T.C.A. Transportation Code Chapter 543 describes the procedures to be used when someone is stopped or arrested for a traffic violation, and it specifically says that the person is either to be taken in front of a court magistrate, or given a notice to appear at a later date in front of a court magistrate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Though I will concede that apparently there&#39;s been a change to their administrative code since the last time I copied and pasted into a motion.  I&#39;ll try to find a better cite to prove my point, though I&#39;ll leave this here.</p>

<p>Instead of going on the assumption of lawful authority, why don&#39;t you first prove the authority of the state exists.</p>

<p>The Texas Transportation Code is written by the agency.  As such, it is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.  As such, any and all disputes are handled under the Contested Case section of APA Texas Gov Code 2001.  The agency has no authority to say that their rule making supersedes their limitations placed upon them by TexGovCode.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT CODE
TITLE 10. GENERAL GOVERNMENT
SUBTITLE A. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE
CHAPTER 2001. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE
SUBCHAPTER C. CONTESTED CASES: 
GENERAL RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES
Sec. 2001.051. OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING AND PARTICIPATION; NOTICE OF HEARING.  In a contested case, each party is entitled to an opportunity:
(1)  for hearing after reasonable notice of not less than 10 days; and
(2)  to respond and to present evidence and argument on each issue involved in the case.</p>

<p>You failed to provide any evidence of a lawful delegation of authority by the People allowing the state to regulate the People either wholly or individually in their private unincorporated and/or non-commercial capacity, and thus hold them criminally accountable under an administrative statute, </p>

<p>My private property, in the form of my car, is not subject to the administrative rule-making authority of TxDoT, or that of any other administrative agency, as I am not engaged in any commercial activity regulated or administered by TxDoT or any other such administrative agency, including the TxDPS.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll try to find more if you want.  And for the record, Thanks for debating this with me.  I enjoy any and all criticism and the opportunity to have true discourse on the matter.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter.  Even under the old, there was no provision for administrative hearings for traffic tickets.  &quot;Contested case&quot; does not refer to a traffic violation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The agency has no authority to say that their rule making supersedes their limitations placed upon them by TexGovCode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t have to.  The Texas statutes supersede any agency rules, and the statutes say when you are stopped for violating the traffic law, you get a citation to appear in court.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You failed to provide any evidence of a lawful delegation of authority by the People allowing the state to regulate the People either wholly or individually in their private unincorporated and/or non-commercial capacity, and thus hold them criminally accountable under an administrative statute,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said it&#39;s an administrative statute?  The laws that specify &quot;rules of the road&quot; are not administrative, they are duly passed by the legislature and are statutes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My private property, in the form of my car, is not subject to the administrative rule-making authority of TxDoT, or that of any other administrative agency, as I am not engaged in any commercial activity regulated or administered by TxDoT or any other such administrative agency, including the TxDPS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TxDot has statutory authority over the Texas roads, period, by act of the Texas legislature and governor signing the law giving them that authority.</p>

The Right to Travel and the Use of Property and the Use of the Public Roads have all been settled in Supreme Court cases long ago. 
You have to know the law and be very specific when fighting your court cases. I do this and win. And I enjoy it. 
As a side note, you can even get judges to violate the law and then file criminal charges against them. That&#39;s even more fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and it <strong>is</strong> a conspiracy.  It is 100% graft and revenue generation.  My grandfather was a lawyer, worked for insurance companies, and then spent decades suing them into oblivion for denying claims.

<p>The local police eventually got to the point that they would literally know <em>exactly</em> when my insurance expired, and send a car out to track me down, pull me over for some made-up reason, and ticket me.  Like, they would come from behind and tell me my windshield was cracked, or claim that they noticed I wasn&#39;t wearing a seatbelt, at night.</p>

<p>The last guy who pulled me over showed me a list on his computer of all of my prior traffic stops.  He said he didn&#39;t even know what the codes on most of them meant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL no.  I&#39;d love to see the &quot;law&quot; and how you think you&#39;re applying it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like you to prove that you&#39;ve had &quot;9 out of 11&quot; citations thrown out.</p>

<p>The law is not some magical talisman where, if you move your hands the right way and use the secret code words, it will not apply to you.  </p>

<p>Drivers&#39; licenses are most certainly required in order to operate a vehicle on public roads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. The caveat to the skeptic thing, to me, is that the &quot;theorists&quot; are the skeptics, while you seem to be toeing the official narratives. In that context they heavily embrace skepticism and you are doing the attacking- and often times, probably rightly so, one cannot generalize the vast amount of topics or merit of in this sub.</p>

<p>You may argue it&#39;s semantics, and this is not an attack on you, but I am subscribed to <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> and I am always hit by the irony that going with the official version of things is being skeptical. </p>

<p>I understand the frustration of people posting hour long vids as a response but on the other hand a number have been well worth watching. Bill Foust&#39;s vids were among those well worth it, IMO. I like to know why people think the things they do, if nothing else, but found pretty compelling stuff in regards to our courts being run under admiralty law and that the US was restructured as a corporation. These claims are not baseless, these are people citing law, court cases, indeed the very changing of our Declaration to all capital letters, switching &quot;for&quot; for &quot;of&quot;. </p>

<p>If you understand how insidious Central Banking inherently is, you know we are all debt-slaves. This doesn&#39;t seem all that implausible once you study it&#39;s history. </p>
