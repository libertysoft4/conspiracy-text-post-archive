        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>FWIW, I deliberately left out the word &quot;autism&quot; in the title because I believe it&#39;s <em>such</em> a loaded term that refers to <em>so</em> many different conditions that bringing it up in a discussion about vaccinations completely distracts from the real issue.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not calling into question <em>all</em> vaccines, because that would fly in the face of decades of scientific research and analysis. </p>

<p>HOWEVER, babies in the US are being given <em>way</em> more vaccines at far younger ages than any other country on the planet. The CDC&#39;s reason for this is to &quot;make sure everybody gets the vaccines&quot; so they&#39;ve increased the frequency and the amount for children, often combining more than 5 different vaccines to be administered at one time.</p>

<p>Does this reasoning not seem like overkill?</p>

<p>My concern is that the fragile and developing immune systems of these babies often can&#39;t handle this barrage of chemicals and viruses, and that the lack of studies on combining these vaccines at such a young age is <em>extremely</em> troubling.</p>

<p>It&#39;s striking how many more vaccines babies get today compared to even 10-15 years ago.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about autism and this isn&#39;t about herd immunity. This is about exposing our children with <em>too many</em> harmful chemicals at one time at young ages.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we live in a climate were questioning the current vaccine schedule is akin to claiming we didn&#39;t go to the moon (or worse, those that question the schedule are causing the <em>deaths</em> of others!).</p>

<p>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, on either side of the argument. Am I being irrational? Or is this a valid concern?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I&#39;ll explain in a different way. Thimerosol and other preservatives that are in each vaccine have been proven to be dangerous to people&#39;s health. It&#39;s not the vaccine people care about, it&#39;s the other things in the vaccine.</p>

<p>So each time you get a dose (doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a booster or a new virus type) you&#39;re getting pumped full of these unwanted chemicals. For a child to be needlessly exposed to these chemicals is literally child abuse.</p>

<p>Would you care to provide some scientific documentation showing this assertion to be true?</p>

<p>Thimerosal is no longer used in childhood vaccines; hasn&#39;t been since between 1999 - 2001.</p>

<p>Thimerosal is metabolized into ethyl mercury and is passed through the body without any negative effect.  People hear the word &quot;mercury&quot; and immediately think that all forms of mercury can cause damage.  The form of mercury that is dangerous is methyl-mercury.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I think you are failing to understand some basic principles so I will make this clear.</p>

<p>First of all, I am not discrediting vaccines, I am explaining to you why people are concerned. You cannot argue against something you do not understand. I am in favour of vaccination, so ad hominems against me only discredit you. This is merely for your understanding.</p>

<p>Second of all, people are worried about the number of preservatives their children are receiving in their vaccines. Preservatives are in ampoules. Whether they receive 100 ampoules of the same virus vaccine or 1 apoule each from 100 virus vaccines, it would make no difference to their concern. Their concern is mostly the number of ampoules. Others may be concerned about the number of viruses.</p>

<p>Third of all, let&#39;s look at the CDC guidelines. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf</a></p>

<p>This clearly shows that children will receive 26 ampoules of injection by the age of 2.</p>

<p>3 ampoules of Hep B (x1 at Birth, x1 at 1 month, x1 at 6 months)</p>

<p>3 ampoules of Rotovirus (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 at 6 months)</p>

<p>4 ampoules of Diptheria/Pertussis/Tetanus (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 at 6 months, x1 at 15 months)</p>

<p>4 ampoules of Haemophilus Influenza B (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 and 6 months, and x1 at 12 months)</p>

<p>4 ampoules of pneumococcus (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 and 6 months, and x1 at 12 months)</p>

<p>3 ampoules of polio (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 and 6 months)</p>

<p>2 ampoules of influenza (x1 at 6 months, x1 at 16 months)</p>

<p>1 ampoule of MMR (x1 at 12 months)</p>

<p>1 ampoule of varicella (x1 at 12 months)</p>

<p>1 ampoule of Hepatitis A (x1 at 12 months)</p>

<p>So yes, kids are being immunized against 14 viruses, but that&#39;s not the concern. The major concern is that they are receiving 26 ampoules with toxic preservatives before the age of 2. The other concern is that they are being injected by too many shots simultaneously (7 shots in a single visit at 6 months). And I&#39;m sure there are other concerns, but I am not an anti-vaxxer so I don&#39;t know what they are.</p>

<p>A lot of anti-vaxers claim this...</p>

<p>More undereducated, misguided misinformation I see.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>people are worried about the number of preservatives their children are receiving in their vaccines. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which ones?  And do you have any proof that they are dangerous?  And which people?  Most thinking people understand how important vaccines are and that they&#39;re safe.  It&#39;s only the delusional paranoid members of society that don&#39;t.  They usually also believe in UFOs, hate Monsanto, hate GMOs, believe the big pharma conspiracy...the list goes on and on with their paranoid delusions.</p>

<p>Everyone on your side (anti-vax no matter how much you try to prove otherwise) loves to use Thiameasol as their go-to toxin of choice; however, Thiamerasol was taken out of childhood vaccines between 1999 - 2001 when they moved from the multi-dose vials to the single-dose ampules.  It was used in order to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination of the multi-dose vials.  It&#39;s effects on the body and the effects of metabolism on Thiamerasol has been found to be safe and without any lasting ill effects. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their concern is mostly the number of ampoules. Others may be concerned about the number of viruses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each single ampule contains the same amount of vaccine as would be given if the multi-dose vials were still used in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The major concern is that they are receiving 26 ampoules with toxic preservatives before the age of 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know they&#39;re toxic?  Do you have any research that&#39;s been done to show this?  And by research I mean academic, peer reviewed research...not &quot;research&quot; you dig up on some anti-vax or alternative medicine website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other concern is that they are being injected by too many shots simultaneously (7 shots in a single visit at 6 months).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This right here is called &quot;vaccine or immune system overload.&quot;  It&#39;s a joke.  There&#39;s on such thing as immune system overload.  Do you realize how many infectious agents you come into contact daily when you are young..you&#39;re immune system is not overloaded.  It&#39;s designed in a way so that it can protect you from a large number of infectious agents at once.</p>

<p>You really need to stop spreading this misinformation you&#39;re spreading.  People who are not able to think independently and are prone to paranoia delusions are going to believe what you say and put the public in danger of very harmful diseases.  </p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not going to change your mind...that&#39;s not what I&#39;m out to do.  Over and over, you&#39;ve shown yourself to be a fool when it comes to this topic and I&#39;ve systematically destroyed every single one of your arguments.  First you agreed with the absurd title of this posting.  Then when you were disproved on that aspect you went onto &quot;Oh, children get 26 ampules of blah blah blah.&quot;  THEN you brought in the mythical idea of immune system overload.  </p>

<p>Please respond, the more you respond, the more foolish you look and the more foolish the entire anti-vax movement looks.</p>

<p>You&#39;re obviously HIGHLY uneducated on this topic.  I&#39;d suggest you go read an immunology text book, although I doubt you&#39;d be able to grasp even the fundamentals since  you believe in the myth of vaccine overload...</p>

<p>No, what you are doing is legitimizing their unfounded and unwarranted concerns.  Even though they may not be your beliefs (highly doubtful though) you are just as complicit in spreading around the undereducated and misguided misinformation floated around by anti-vaxers.  Good job.</p>

<p>Conversely, I&#39;m thankful I avoided a lot of the recalled vaccines, like HPV. I love SCIENCE, but I feel like a lot of products are rushed to market and have side effects that can&#39;t be taken back. I agree with OP that the rush for mandatory vaccinations that have not been around for a decade or so (without clear clinics and trials) are a bit unnerving. </p>

<p>No conspiracy here though, just the sad outcome of greed fed by fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say you love science, I think you are really saying that you love the ideal of science. The problem is that science has become a political tool. The tabacco lobby managed to use science for years to convince us that cigarettes were not harmful - until common sense won over in the end (to give an obvious example of how science can be manipulated). The same happens with GMOs. Science can be corrupted, and thus become anti-science. It seems to me that the science that defends vaccines is political... I could be wrong, but what is often missing from the debate is the acknowledgement that this is at least possible and should be part of the debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a personal attack: Publicly questioning anything to do vaccinations will inevitably lead to an unfavorable comparison to Jenny McCarthy in the same way that questioning the use of fluoride in drinking water will lead to similar comparisons to other lunatics. There may be valid concerns regarding the number and frequency of vaccinations in American children, but, those concerns are immediately discredited by the majority of the public due to negative media coverage of vaccine deniers like McCarthy. 
A few things to consider regarding vaccines: The science behind vaccines is unassailable if fact based methods are employed. The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and DT ( diphtheria and tetanus) vaccines combine several diseases into one dose because it increases the effectiveness of the vaccines. Hepatitis B vaccinations must be given in series or little or no resistance is imparted. I would also add that the amount of harmful chemicals (formalin is an example) in vaccines and their effects on the human body is negligible, even in infants, even with multiple doses. Infants exposed to attenuated or dead microbes in minute amounts will be better able to resist those diseases in the future.
The driving argument against/for mass inoculation is philosophical in nature: Do the needs of the many (millions of children dying or being maimed by preventable infectious disease) outweigh the needs of the few (a minute percentage of those immunizations causing death or maiming)?   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Does this reasoning not seem like overkill?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are places in the United States that are experiencing outbreaks of <em>whooping cough.</em> That is absurd, and that is why the CDC takes such drastic measures to make sure as many people get vaccinated for as many things as possible. People who don&#39;t get vaccinated put everyone at risk by bringing down herd immunity. I would not go so far as to say that the CDC is immaculate by any means, but they have no scientific reason so far to advise against this method of vaccination. And no, anecdotal acounts by a few concerned parents is <strong>not</strong> science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My concern is that the fragile and developing immune systems of these babies often can&#39;t handle this barrage of chemicals and viruses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you&#39;re basing this on your years of medical school/graduate education in a relevant field?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this isn&#39;t about herd immunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is about herd immunity. Anyone not being properly vaccinated is a detriment to herd immunity. Also, for every bit of time that you put off a vaccination, you are creating an opportunity for your child to become a vector. A measles outbreak in Arizona in 2008 (IIRC) was caused by a very young kid who had just come back from Switzerland. Now, I don&#39;t think his parents intended to vaccinate him at all, but even if they were just going to vaccinate him later, the outbreak was going to happen. If you wait and then your kid becomes infected and therefore a vector, every immune-compromised person, every infant that is too young for the given vaccination, and anyone else that does not have immunity, is at risk of infection because some kid&#39;s parents decided out of the blue and with no evidence that the given vaccine was dangerous or was too close in time to another. That&#39;s why we talk about herd immunity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is about exposing our children with too many harmful chemicals at one time at young ages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry professor, I must have missed your explanation of the relevant biochemistry. Could you go over it again?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s striking how many more vaccines babies get today compared to even 10-15 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s striking how much more advanced medical science is compared to 10-15 years ago. What did you even mean by this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we live in a climate were questioning the current vaccine schedule is akin to claiming we didn&#39;t go to the moon (or worse, those that question the schedule are causing the deaths of others!).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll agree that the conversation is being perhaps unjustly strangled, but many of the people who criticize the schedule also opted not to get many of the vaccines recommended, or did not get them when they were critically important.</p>

<p>You are being irrational. Excuse me if I have been harsh, but you have to understand what these vaccine &quot;questioners&quot; look like from outside of the movement: a bunch of paranoid, nutty concerned mothers shrieking about things that they do not understand (and are therefore unquestioningly afraid of).</p>

<p>No, of course not. It&#39;s important to get as much scientific data as we can; for now, though, there&#39;s no support for vaccines being harmful, and there&#39;s no support for the assumption that grouping them makes them worse.</p>

<p>Reasonable people won&#39;t jump down your throat for questioning the vaccine schedule (go ahead, <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a> about evidence for grouping vaccines). However, the &quot;anti-vac&quot; movement is pretty much entirely based on pseudoscience and the mythical vaccines=autism link and the movement is actually putting people&#39;s lives in preventable danger.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t associate with anti-vacs and people won&#39;t hate you for asking reasonable questions. Reasonable questions about vaccine science don&#39;t belong in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, though.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, exactly. Herd immunity is a definition. I&#39;m not arguing that second point, that 95% vaccination can eliminate a disease, so I&#39;m not going to try to debunk that article (whose sources consist primarily of &quot;greenmedinfo.com&quot;). I linked to herd immunity because I was talking about it&#39;s definition: the more people vaccinated, the less chance there is of getting infected.</p>

<p>If you think vaccines work (as I do), then herd immunity is obvious: more people vaccinated means fewer carriers means fewer infections. If you don&#39;t think vaccines work, then herd immunity is irrelevant. I was simply highlighting herd immunity as the reason why <em>I</em> wouldn&#39;t be content with each of us vaccinating our children only if we felt like it.</p>

<p>Source? If you are referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal">Thiomersal</a>, it has been all but eliminated from childhood vaccines since 1999. Before that, it was still within safety limits. It is continued to be used in vaccines outside of North America and Europe, as the WHO has concluded that there is no evidence of it&#39;s toxicity in vaccine dosages.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to cite them. What you link is completely unscientific:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The data was collected from parents with vaccine-free children via an internet questionnaire by vaccineinjury.info and Andreas Bachmair, a German classical homeopathic practitioner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An online poll on a site dedicated to showing vaccines are harmful (and run by a homeopath) is not a reliable source in the slightest. He analyzes only respondents with &quot;entirely unvaccinated children&quot; completely throwing basic statistical/scientific concepts such as &quot;control groups&quot; out the window. It also features basic math errors that I don&#39;t want to bother to list, and, if you actually read his results, you&#39;ll find that his numbers on autism in unvaccinated children match those reported in general populations, but Bachmair conveniently ignores this. This is not honest science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally speaking vaccines are effective in combating the target disease (the one you are getting vaccinated for) but the downside of this is that the chemicals they put in the vaccines in order to be effective also do serious damage to the immune system. A recent german study confirms this, kids are more likely to get other diseases if they are vaccinated than if they are not vaccinated at all:</p>

<p><a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2011/new-study-vaccinated-children-have-2-to-5-times-more-diseases-and-disorders-than-unvaccinated-children/">http://healthimpactnews.com/2011/new-study-vaccinated-children-have-2-to-5-times-more-diseases-and-disorders-than-unvaccinated-children/</a></p>

<p>The very way vaccines are administered in bad for you, going straight into the bloodstream bypasses the body&#39;s natural defenses/skin/lungs etc. and throws tons of shit right into you. This causes the lymph nodes and white blood cell production to go crazy, and really does long term damage because the body&#39;s natural defenses are thrown into overdrive in a very short period of time, rather than naturally contracting a disease in which case the body has forewarning and has time to prepare. In addition, the chemicals in vaccines such as mercury will do long term damage to your immune system, which explains the german kiggs study&#39;s results. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s hilarious to see the mainstream opinion on reddit as pro-mandantory vaccination, as if humans didnt survive thousands of years without vaccines. I know the argument against that is that tons of people died, and with vaccines, NO ONE HAS TO DIE, but the interesting thing is, the majority of the reason polio and measles were virtually wiped out is not so much vaccination, as it is generational antibody production, much the same way diseases mutate to combat immune systems, immune systems adapt to combat disease. The body is capable of healing itself, and we didnt get here after thousands of years by 100% NEEDING VACCINES.</p>

<p>The more vaccines we throw into people, the more they need to be vaccinated, as the immune system gets damaged more and more, thus vaccines become less effective (as the immune system cannot deal with diseases as effective, even if vaccinated, because of all the vaccines that have been thrown at it over the years, but we need to vaccinate even MORE as the immune system can do less and less by itself. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really surprised <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t more anti-vaccine, because just like so much else in the world, the system operates by making people hopelessly reliant upon it, in the same way people are reliant upon factory farms for food, reliant upon debt for growth, reliant upon religious leaders for spirituality, or reliant upon endless vaccines to keep us healthy, it&#39;s all designed to keep everyone under control, and to conform. </p>

<p>This sentence is all kind of stupidity.  <strong>How exactly does your body prepare for an infectious organism when a vaccine isn&#39;t infectious?</strong>  The vaccine provides the exact same immune response as an infection does, but because the vaccine is either a killed, attenuated, or piece of the infectious organism, you don&#39;t get an infection.  Lymph nodes are in place to remove junk from your system, they are always working hard.  </p>

<p>I suggest you read an immunology book and really try to understand the workings of the immune system before you type some crazy stuff like this.  You can pick up a few good, easy to read ones online for pretty cheap.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>such as mercury will do long term damage to your immune system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mercury is no longer used in childhood vaccines in the US, hasn&#39;t been since about 1999 - 2001.  There are a few flu vaccines that have thimerosol in them, but thimerosol is converted into ethyl mercury which is harmlessly excreted by the body.  Methyl mercury is the dangerous form of mercury.</p>

<p>No, the body doesn&#39;t change the organisms. The analogy I will make is that if a disease goes through the usual layers of protection the body will start to mobilize its defenses the same way a country would call up troops if another country declared war. The difference is rather than being prepared for the enemy once it finally starts to attack, having a vaccine put even an &quot;attenuated&quot; version of the virus straight into the bloodstream is an equivalent of a surprise attack on washington D.C. as far as the &quot;oh shit&quot; response of your body. It&#39;s very taxing on the immune system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How exactly does your body prepare for an infectious organism when a vaccine isn&#39;t infectious? The vaccine provides the exact same immune response as an infection does, but because the vaccine is either a killed, attenuated, or piece of the infectious organism, you don&#39;t get an infection. Lymph nodes are in place to remove junk from your system, they are always working hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above explanation. The reaction your body goes through in a &quot;I know whats coming&quot; versus &quot;oh shit wtf&quot; is actually extremely different even though the mechanisms of action are the same. It puts incredible stress on your immune system. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note, I know you may try to twist this and say I&#39;m advocating the use of thimerosal. I&#39;m not, I&#39;m just showing you how uniformed and undereducated you are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mercury and thimerisol are just examples. There are tons of chemicals that can cause adverse reactions to children and even adults in vaccines, there are plenty of cases (although not the norm) that confirm this. </p>

<p>If you were really as unbiased as you think you are you would go do your own independent investigation of vaccines as countless doctors and individuals have, and come to the conclusion that the mainstream position is total garbage. The same way anti-depressants are only there to keep customers coming back for more by treating depression rather than curing it, vaccines require more vaccines because of the damage each one does to the immune system. </p>

<p>The main problem with vaccines is the fact that adjuvants are needed in order to stimulate the immune system to respond effectively to the disease. When going through normal avenues of approach such as skin/lungs the body sees whats coming and produces a response at a normal rate. With vaccines, chemicals are used in order to help the body to go into overdrive and effectively respond to the vaccine. The side effect of this is like overcharging any electrical system--it does permanent damage. This explains why numerous studies show that &quot;non-target&quot; diseases are more prevalent among vaccinated people than non-vaccinated individuals. </p>

<p>I suggest you read an immunology book and really try to understand the workings of the immune system before you type some crazy stuff like this. You can pick up a few good, easy to read ones online for pretty cheap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A typical mainstream reddit user, with a snarky statement like that you sure do think you&#39;re smart. For your information, I have read a good bit of immunology books, just not the watered down &quot;next generation&quot; sheeple version you&#39;ve obviously been reading.</p>

<p>Looked through your comment history, looks like you&#39;re in nursing school so you&#39;re obviously not going to go against what the very profession you&#39;ve decided to be in has told you to believe. I&#39;m not going to waste time convincing someone of something that at the core of them--they cannot bring themselves to believe--even if it is the truth.</p>

<p>Just in case you really are interested in the truth, let me drop some tidbits of verifiable information on you:</p>

<p>FACT: Before the Polio Vaccine, there had never been a virus from another species deliberately injected into humans.</p>

<p>FACT: 61% of all human tumors (at autopsy) now contain the SV40 monkey virus, traceable to the Polio vaccine of the 1950s and 60s</p>

<p>FACT: CUTTER vaccine division and WYETH produced a deadly Polio vaccine with a live virus that actually gave the recipient POLIO</p>

<p>FACT: All above information was withheld from the public for years to avoid a public panic and to prevent a loss of faith in vaccines. polio was a very rare infectious disease that presented little risk to the public, but the risk was greatly exaggerated by the Polio Foundation before the introduction of the  polio vaccine, the miracle vaccine - contaminated with a monkey virus which has been the cause of soft tissue cancers for decades since.</p>

<p>This can be confirmed in this well researched and documented book:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your argument is based upon the idea that the immune system works in one layer at a time.  This is completely false.  Once through the skin, the immune system works in concert.  As I said vaccines are killed, weakened or particles of an infectious organism.  Actually, a living infectious organism would send the immune system into haywire more, based on your shoddy theory.  When a host cell is killed be an infectious organism it sends out cytokines in order to have an immune response.  This mobilizes the white blood cells more than a vaccine.  Since a vaccine is a killed, weakened or particle of an infectious organism, it doesn&#39;t produce such a response and if it does it is much weaker than the infectious organism.</p>

<p>Ummm...NO...not even close.  The immune system response is the same with the vaccine and the non-infectious organism.  </p>

<p>WRONG!!!  It varies widely from country-to-country but most have around the same vaccine requirements as we do in the US.  You&#39;d also be interested to know that a few required the BCG vaccine which is the vaccine against TB.  You&#39;d also be interested to know that once a person has a BCG vaccine they must have a chest x-ray as well as a PPD reading to ensure they don&#39;t have TB.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pretty vague term here.  Mortality in terms of what?  What age group are you referring to?  Are you implying that we have a higher mortality rate due to infectious diseases?  If so, what infectious diseases?  That&#39;s a very broad, generalized, and cliche statement.</p>

<p>Not everyone has to be monitored for TB after having the vaccine; however, if someone wants to work in healthcare or with children, they must get a TB test.  If they&#39;ve had the BCG vaccine, this means they also have to have a chest x-ray because the PPD will sometimes show positive for the TB toxins and antibodies.  The point was to tell you that in Europe they actually MORE vaccines than we do in the US.  </p>

<p>As you can see in the first link, in 2005, the SIDS rates in the US and most European countries was statistically the same.  I provided the second one so that you can brush up on the subject since you clearly don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about... Seriously, are you just pulling stuff out of your ass here?!?</p>

<p>Are you implying that SIDS is caused by vaccines?  If so, you are again misguided.  Like autism, there&#39;s no proof between childhood vaccinations and SIDS:</p>

<p>It looks like you&#39;re deflecting.  I&#39;ve systematically disproved every single point you&#39;ve made so now you have no where else to turn but accuse me of being angry.  There&#39;s no angry tone whatsoever in any of my posts, but then again like I said, you have no where else to turn.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this same exact response by anti-vaxxers all the time...strange that you claim to not be anti-vaccine, yet use their same tactics...such a weird reaction from someone who claims not to be anti-vaccine.</p>

<p>As for vaccine safety, there are plenty of studies available about the safety of vaccines, 20,000+ at least at last count.  None of them have any earth shattering implication about dangers of vaccines.  The one study that ALMOST did was the Wakefield study, but then look what happened?  Falsified data, lies, retractions from a very prestigious medical journal, removal of his medical license and ability to practice medicine...</p>

<p>The one thing the anti-vaxxers always say (yes, I&#39;m lumping you in with them, don&#39;t care if you say you aren&#39;t anti-vax, its very clear that you are) is that &quot;more research needs to be done.&quot;  Hogwash on their part, they are just waiting to find research to bolster their claims.  Vaccines have been around for 50+ years, and if anything they are getting safer, not less safe.  Good luck on your crusade of anti-vaccination.  Thankfully most people aren&#39;t as under educated about the topic as you clearly shown...over...and over again.</p>

<p>I know full well I won&#39;t change your anti-vax mind, but at least I&#39;ve made you look like a fool sufficiently enough so someone reading your responses will realize how uneducated your stance is.</p>

<p>Is this supposed to be two sentences?   It has nothing to do with the government asking or not asking people to vaccinate.  There is no federal requirement to vaccinate, it is done state-by-state.  You&#39;d know this if you&#39;d have done your own research.  The problem is that people like you spread lies and misguided information that influences people to make terrible decisions of not vaccinating their children.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does that. Get you so upset? Weird.</p>

<p>As I said, it influences people not to vaccinate.  People who are undereducated on topics (clearly this is you in this case) always point to correlation.  There has never been any proof that DTaP causes SIDS, only a correlation.  In fact, the SIDS rates are decreasing world-wide.  If you&#39;d have looked at any of those links I provided you, you&#39;d have realized how shaky your argument is.</p>

<p>Please, keep do responding.  I myself would rather come off as looking angry and educated rather than foolish (like yourself).  </p>

<p>Since it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re going to come back to the SIDS argument, I&#39;m just going to quit.  I&#39;ve succeeded enough in making you look foolish and tearing apart your arguments.  Hopefully enough people will read our little exchange and realize that you anti-vaxxers base your arguments on conjecture and opinions rather than scientific research and publications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And which 40 vaccines are those?</p>

<p>These are the following recommended childhood vaccines and the ages when they should be given:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hep A (12 - 23 months)</li>
<li>Hep B ( Birth, 1-2 months, and 6 - 18 months)</li>
<li>Rotavirus (2, 4 and 6 months)</li>
<li>Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (2, 4, 6, 15 - 18 months and 4 - 6 years)</li>
<li>Haemophilus influenz B (2, 4, 6, and 12 - 15 months)</li>
<li>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (2, 4, 6, and 12 - 15 months)</li>
<li>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (2 - 6 years)</li>
<li>Inactivated poliovirus (2, 4, 6 - 18 months and 4 - 6 years)</li>
<li>Flu (all ages)</li>
<li>MMR (12 - 15 months and 4 - 6 years)</li>
<li>Varicella (12 - 15 months and 4 - 6 years)</li>
<li>Meningococcal (2 - 6 years)</li>
<li>Human Papillomavirus (11 - 12 years)</li>
</ol>

<p>That is a grand total of 13 vaccines that are given...for pretty horrific diseases.  I know...I know...people like you think the vaccine is worse than the disease, but it&#39;s not.  These are debilitating diseases that can be eradicated but unfortunately people like you who pedal in junk science are often given a broad microphone in the media without any counter balance to your erroneous claim. </p>

<p>Vaccines are safe, there are small risks of side effects but that goes along with anything.  There&#39;s absolutely nothing ominous about them, but I guess when you believe the big pharma conspiracy story it&#39;s different.  </p>

<p>People who do not vaccinate their children should be held financially liable for any illness suffered after exposure to those children by unvaccinated infants for by individuals for whom the vaccine is not effective.  </p>

A money maker if I&#39;ve ever seen one, similar to anti-depressants, fixing the problem by forever prescribing drugs...go off the drugs and you&#39;re worse off than you were before you were on them.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say <em>anywhere</em> that children shouldn&#39;t be vaccinated at all, so bringing up the red herring that is Jenny McCarthy&#39;s bullshit crusade completely distracts from my point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m suggesting that perhaps we need to space out the current vaccine schedule, especially for infants. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t equate this to killing people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Infant mortality was around 6% 75 years ago as opposed to 0.4% today (in the US).</p>

<p>And not only that, but infectious disease was by far the largest killer of all people 75 years ago where it is eclipsed now by both heart disease and cancer (in the US).</p>

<p>If you think vaccinations have had no effect on either of these stats then you would be mistaken.</p>

<p>Also, what are these &quot;natural resistances&quot; you speak of?  By what biochemical mechanism do they act? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>adaptive response occurs over a person&#39;s lifetime, not over generations.</p>

<p>I believe that there are lots of people in pain, some acutely and some chronically who greatly benefit from pain medication. I think that this outweighs the overdoses, GI bleeds, and addictions that can come from that medicine.</p>

<p>In regards to antibiotics I believe that the harms of allergic reactions and diarrhea are minor in comparison to their benefits. The risk of antibiotic resistance is a null argument as you can only argue that the worst harm makes it so that antibiotics are useless, which isn&#39;t really a harm at all if they weren&#39;t beneficial in the first place.</p>
