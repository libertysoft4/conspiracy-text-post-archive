    <div class="md"><p>I thought for sure the aircraft had come in at a steep dive to get maximum effect by starting fires as low to the ground as possible.  I was stunned to see the planes hit so high up.  It made no sense.  To hit that high up would cause most people to run like hell and get out, they did.</p>

<p>The time of day was wrong too.  The big shots were not at work yet when the first plane hit.  To get the most out of the effort, the right time would be about 2 pm when the buildings would be as full as they will ever get.    </p>

<p>For all the bad guys &#39;planning&#39;, they did a shitty job, but if it was an inside job they got it right with the least number killed and maximum special effects.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To this day, I still remember watching the footage of something-that-wasn&#39;t-an-airplane crashing into the Pentagon on the news once just after it happened, and then never, ever seeing it again. It seemed pretty clear that whatever hit the Pentagon was not human piloted as it dove very steep, pulled up at the last moment and then it seemed like there was not enough left afterward to have been an airplane.</p>

<p>That along with the coincidental training by the military at the same time made me very suspicious .. but the part that really bakes my noodle is that they didn&#39;t even bother to try and answer all the questions people had. </p>

<p>If it was all for real, you&#39;d think that they would want ALL the information to be able to figure out what happened .. unless they already knew what happened. But instead, it seemed like it was a matter of getting the ideas to catch on and then they just ran with it.</p>

<p>I did notice the tower tipping as if it was going to fall over and then mysteriously disappear/crumble into nothingness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. I was in my late teens when it happened and didn&#39;t really know what to think at that time. It wasn&#39;t until years later that I started to hear theories going around that it was an inside job. Of course, being the pessimist I am, I started to do some research on it and found a lot of discrepancies with the entire event. The more I looked, the more I found. Now I&#39;m at the point where I just can&#39;t believe so many people still believe that we had no idea about this attack at all, or any involvement for that matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in high school at the time. My history teacher turned on the news, and we all watched, eyes glued to the screen. </p>

<p>There was the clip of people cheering in the streets somewhere in the middle east shown on Fox News (I think it later turned out that this was recycled footage, wag the dog style). A girl then spoke up and said &quot;Fuck those people, we should bomb them and let them see what it feels like!&quot;</p>

<p>I spoke up at this point, normally keeping quiet in class. I said &quot;Hold up a minute. First, we&#39;re Americans. We believe in free speech. As detestable as that cheering is, it is their right, even if they aren&#39;t Americans. Second, no nation has claimed responsibility. It&#39;s not time to bring out the big guns yet. It&#39;s time to let the FBI and CIA do their jobs.&quot;</p>

<p>The entire class turned on me. &quot;Whose side are you on, asshole?&quot; &quot;Fucking towel-head lover&quot; etc. The teacher calmed down the class, turned to me and said &quot;I get where you&#39;re coming from, but you&#39;re flat out wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Later that day, in the hallway, I saw a muslim girl. I just stared at her. She probably thought I was feeling the hatred that everyone else was feeling, but all I could imagine was what she was going to go through for the next few weeks. </p>

<p>I left that high school before the year finished.</p>

<p>One video does not many make. It was <em>a</em> video. One. And it was posted to show you my point of view, not to ridicule. Neither of us were there that day, so we don&#39;t know what really happened. We are forced to take the word of the media, something that the <em>video</em> (not two or three, but 1) addresses. Some of us realize that taking the media at their word is probably not a good thing. </p>

<p>What a way to show expanded focus. Again, I posted the video as a way to start a discussion, not push a view on anyone. If you read my initial post, it isn&#39;t trying to stuff an idea down anyone&#39;s gob, it&#39;s meant to express notions which I think are closest to what actually transpired.

(I watched msm back then, total idiot move)  I remember the story of the vans filled with explosives being captured and some other stories here and there about the other vans that were found and the occupants mentioned as being israeli)  The whole time though they were insisting they were almost sure it was al-CIAda, binny, all that jazz.  Then I remember the shocking (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agsHd1bSU30">pre-recorded in 1993!! and edited into the 9/11 horror story to fool us all by our traitor zio-media!!) video of palastinians cheering</a> in the streets about the destruction, and suddenly, like most of america, I seem to have forgotten the vans and israelis for awhile and wanted to sign up to go kill something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in the 8th grade and my parents took me out of school for the day and I remember seeing the buildings on fire and thinking &quot;well that sucks but there is no way that it would fall so surely we can clean up and rebuild&quot; I mean the building was pretty well intact at that point nothing more than a small fire. Then the buildings started to fall before my eyes. Even at that age I knew that that was physically impossible look at a normal house fire those things don&#39;t just fall straight down in on themselves how often have you seen the charred skeleton of a house still standing after they put it out and yet I am supposed to believe that the plane hitting toward the top is supposed to collapse it at the top? Surely heads would be rolling somewhere if they hadn&#39;t planned on a building that size getting hit by something. Didn&#39;t the empire state building get hit by a plane and not fall down? I was willing to look past that but then the buildings just kept falling. Even WTC7 which wasn&#39;t hit at all not even by falling debris. I knew right away that there had to be more too it and that these sort of things shouldn&#39;t happen, though I was probably to blissfully unaware as to the scope of the problem. Then when they showed the pictures of the pentagon and said that not only was that whole wing of the building emptied for the day but that there were no plane parts to be seen which even fireworks leave behind something why would a plane leave  0 parts on the ground, and why wouldn&#39;t there be impressions of a wing on either side as a plane would leave. There was just a round whole and no debris on the ground outside I knew it was probably not what they were saying it was. After that were those ridiculous adds and people singing to raise money for the cause and politicians saying 9/11 every chance they got. I don&#39;t think any of us will ever truly know what happened that day other than the people who orchestrated that but look at the fruit of the tree on this one. Not only that but if Osama Bin Laden was the culprit why then were we going after Sadam Hussein? Death and destruction have been all that have followed this and they have used this as a way to push through things that the American people would never have imagined. Now they have classified who we are even fighting against. Not even Congress is allowed to know who we are at war with and we aren&#39;t allowed to know how they vote on legislation. If it wasn&#39;t an inside job why does nothing the insiders say add up? If they are really the honest good meaning government of yesteryear that we all remember and they are just responding to an attack then why has the war not ended now that we killed him? Why were all the emergency services told to stay home or be apart of a drill taking place involving the exact same scenario? I think you would have to be crazy to believe the official story it just doesn&#39;t add up no matter where you are looking</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right. My grammar is atrocious, I work on it a lot though it has really never been a strong suit of mine. Thank you for pointing that out to me, perhaps that is just what I need to remember to proof read my posts in the future. </p>

<p>I had never seen a lot of the pictures you had linked to. I appreciate you showing me another side to the story. Maybe it is just my ignorance to the facts at hand but it didn&#39;t seem all that conclusive. The eye witness testimony speaks first of green plane parts and wheel wells that belong to smaller planes, then goes on to say it is blue and red like American airlines and everything fits. The article reads like the writers don&#39;t even believe what they are saying. The engine part did appear to be from that sort of plan, though the presence of other plane stuff seems odd but maybe that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>As far as building seven I will conceded there very well could have been damage to the building. There does appear to be cosmetic damage, and there is no telling how extensive the damage was. Both of the other buildings collapsed in on themselves so I think we can all agree that in order to collapse in on itself it would have to have been a pretty unlikely set of circumstances. A critical support beam or several depending on the building specs must be taken out near the bottom, it would have to be hit in just the right way. I have yet to see a building collapse like that before or since, outside of controlled demolitions. If it were possible for some damage to the side it certainly would be a fluke. You expect me to believe that occurred three times... because a plane crash toward the top off the buildings.</p>

<p>I am certainly not an engineer or a scientist, and I don&#39;t build sky scrapers for a living. So I must defer to the judgment of those that do. Ae911truth.org has about 2000 engineers and architects  and thousands of other supporters who swear it couldn&#39;t have happened that way.</p>

<p>I will admit I have no idea what I am looking at where you mentioned 125 people dying. I don&#39;t remember there being any deaths perhaps I have forgotten important details over the years, but I can&#39;t tell at all what that diagram is trying to tell me and how that would relate to a death toll. I realize that it must be where the plane crashed, and I see that it is color coded but there is no key to say what the colors mean perhaps you could educate me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 20 and had been up all night doing knife-hits of Hashish at a buddy&#39;s house about an hour away from where I lived at the time. Someone in the other room decided to flip on the television. I just remember him saying &quot;Holy fuck... a plane hit the WTC&quot;. We all came in to watch a bit just as the 2nd plane hit. The first thought that crossed my mind was &quot;we pay lots of people money to sit around all day hoping to God they get a chance to jump in a jet and intercept shit&quot;. We wound up jumping in the car and driving home shortly after, my friend was pissed primarily because his sister had enlisted recently and was likely about to go to war; I was pissed because I was certain they were going to cancel the Tool concert which was two days later. (they did. Tool didn&#39;t come back for another year or so i think...) </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until later that evening I saw the footage of the towers collapse. Honestly I got very scared. The fear was not sourced in any perceived or contrived foreign entity; it was the fear of realizing exactly how little people in power care for the lives of others. All those things like COINTELPRO and MK-ULTRA suddenly became very real and no longer just likely history, it was happening right now.</p>

<p>The single most polarizing aspect of the entire experience was talking about it back then. To speak of the many Bin Ladens, of Demolitions, of Interceptors, of NORAD, of noplane@pentagon, of Pretext-For-War, of Molten Steel... was to be ostracized. I had nights in a kitchen where I was the one person in the entire fucking restaurant with an anti-war position. I had a term for that terrible moment when the person arguing with you actually considers the information, then it crashes into the person&#39;s societal structure of beliefs, forcing them to re-evaluate their beliefs. I called it &quot;State-Sponsored Denial&quot; and it usually results in people summoning the kind of anger they&#39;d use to defend their religion or way-of-life, and dismissing your points in classic ad hominem fashion. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t be correct because <em>you are fucking crazy</em>.</p>

<p>tl;dr: I didn&#39;t drink the Kool-Aid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was around 14 when it all happened. I remember leaving school on our busses early that day (in northwest Arkansas). My friends and I were not really worried because we are in the heart of America and didn&#39;t really understand the situation to the full extent. People were saying we were under attack. Some teachers were pulling their T.V.s out and watching the news. I didn&#39;t get to watch much of it until we got home. That night, I was annoyed about missing the new episode of &quot;Who&#39;s line is it anyway?&quot; My brother threatened to punch me for saying that... As we watched the news though I couldn&#39;t help but say it looked like a demolition site. I remember I used to watch controlled demos on tv and was very fascinated on how they did it in Vegas and LA. Then building 7 collapsed without anything touching it and I that made me VERY skeptical then. As I got older it seemed that tv and news stopped mentioning building 7 altogether. Even on 911 news specials that I saw last year it was not mentioned once... I argue with my dad from time to time about it but he never takes my word. He says conspiracy theorys and whatnot so I just stop talking with him about it. I think he is coming around though because of the NSA.</p>

That&#39;s up for questioning. </p>

<p>As for back then... I actually researched current events in the school library on that day and initially came to the conclusion that the Chinese did it, because Bush&#39;s people had lost a spy plane in China just a day or two beforehand. </p>
