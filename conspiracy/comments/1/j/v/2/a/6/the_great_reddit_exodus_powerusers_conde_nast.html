    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how we are different:</p>

<p>1) There is no common feed. Your feed is based on following any combination of users, tags, or domains. When you follow a user, you see what they post, and what they share. You can ignore any user, tag, or domain, and posts with them won&#39;t appear in your feed.</p>

<p>2) Users are their own moderators. You can ignore users and tags, and you can mute users, which means they can&#39;t comment on your posts. You can&#39;t moderate on another user&#39;s post.</p>

<p>3) Posts can have up to two tags from the author, and the community can add a third tag. (Newbies can&#39;t participate in community tagging)</p>

<p>4) When you&#39;ve used Hubski for a bit, you can start badging content. Badges highlight comments and posts for the rest of the community to see. Here is the <a href="http://hubski.com/badgesubs">badged feed</a>. As you use Hubski, you earn badges that you can give away.</p>

<p>5) PMs can include any number of users.</p>

<p>6) There&#39;s a bunch of other things, from active magnet links to a chatter page, that shows you what people around your feed are talking about. But 1-5 is the most important stuff. We are working on some other things at the moment.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been around for a while, and we aren&#39;t going anywhere. We have our own goals, and they aren&#39;t always the same as Reddit&#39;s. People often think we won&#39;t survive the eternal September, but that misunderstands the nature of the site. Hubski is more like Twitter when it comes to what you see. There&#39;s a ton of crap on Twitter, but it&#39;s easy for me to avoid it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions.</p>

<p>-We recently passed 7k.</p>

<p>-Mostly male, mostly US, I think late 20&#39;s early 30&#39;s. There are plenty of exceptions though. I don&#39;t think the people that I follow are the same demographic. That&#39;s kind of the beauty of it. You build your own version of Hubski.</p>

<p>-It&#39;s privately owned. I own a controlling share. Four others split the rest. I met two of them through the site. We don&#39;t make any money.</p>

<p>-Not that I am aware of. The Daily Dot did a <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/hubski-reddit-mark-katakowski/">piece on us</a> in the very beginning. We&#39;ve had almost no press. The short version is that I wanted to build a site that provided what I was looking for. I have goals for the site, and that&#39;s what guides us. We aren&#39;t flailing about trying to get popular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;independent&quot; much like &#39;objective&#39; or&#39;free&#39;, is largely a conceptual fallacy. </p>

<p>If you go to far round the bend of independent you come out on the side of &#39;authorized/verified&#39; independent - but who would verify its independence. at Least on reddit there are more verifiers or authorizers. Its kinda dualistic, and I think Reddit in its current form is invaluable in providing a diversified and adaptive platform. What more could we expect? At least here we can game back...</p>

<p>In my pragmatic opinion, reddit is adaptive and resilient to being destroyed by being gamed but not protected from it entirely. Its a fair balance and its power is in the myriad of users&#39; awareness-es</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post dos. I just found out about <a href="http://digg.com/">digg</a>.</p>

<p>Reddit doesn&#39;t get it&#39;s shit together; it will fail. And failing can mean; lose it&#39;s intellectual community. How many of you still pay for television? Case in point. </p>

<p>Innovation will eradicate this fuck of a site before too long; if they don&#39;t start doing things right. In the meantime... an exodus is a great idea. Although I&#39;ll admit... sticking around and educating the retarded has it&#39;s merits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great links/comment, thanks. Digg looks like it used to be pretty great. If you haven&#39;t checked out <a href="http://hubski.com/">hubski</a>, I&#39;d recommend that as a similar site to what digg looks like it used to be.</p>

<p>But ya. So far I&#39;m most impressed with hubski; as far as format goes. It could likely use more of a user base and probably has some lack where reddit doesn&#39;t... but seriously; reddit&#39;s fucked anyway. Only reason I stick around is for the meaningful posts/conversations/education I can provide and engage in here. When something better comes along; I won&#39;t hesitate to abandon this site forever.</p>
