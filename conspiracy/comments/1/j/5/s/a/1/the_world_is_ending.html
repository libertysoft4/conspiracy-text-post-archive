Pick at any one strand and follow it long enough...they all connect to the fact that the world is ending.  And yet people go on everyday totally oblivious.  TV, GMOs, and Pharmaceuticals have done their job.</p>

<p>So, how do you deal with it?  The cognitive dissonance between what I know the facts are about what is going on versus what the  average person thinks is going on is really starting to get to me.  Knowing that at least 80% of these people are about to die when the grid collapses and also knowing that if I try to explain that to them they will just think that I&#39;m a whack job is really doing my head in.</p>

<p>How do you cope?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your lofty reaction, sir.</p>

<p>Truth is that I wish more of us humans would own up to our ability to change things for the better.  We seem to be too stuck in the role of the sheep that we&#39;ve been indoctrinated into believing we are by TPTB to be able to stand up and do what&#39;s right, however.  This is, of course, very unfortunate, for if we DID do what we&#39;re actually capable of, then we could transform this planet into a clean utopia and make it very different than it currently is.</p>

<p>The extent toward which we are lazy and complacent and allowing of the wrongs and the evils that continue going on around us, however, is the very extent toward which we ourselves are damned as a society and a civilization.</p>

<p>For instance, I recently purchased a house.  In the back of my mind, there&#39;s all these worries about a financial or social collapse.  I had to come to the realization that <em>if</em> things get really bad, I might lose all I&#39;ve worked for.</p>

<p>If you think, &quot;It&#39;s all hopeless.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s nothing that I can do.&quot; &quot;There are too many problems to solve.&quot; <strong>Then you are not &#39;awakened&#39; yet.  You are still part of group think.</strong>  Having a life that your children can live in is worth fighting for.  There are many problems, with solutions to each, all can be solved one at the time (many, can be solved at the same time) but it still takes effort to move in that direction.  And thinking that you are worthless or have no effect is a lie.  You have a voice, you can use it.  Keep spreading the word out and try to awaken as many as you can.  I know it may not seem like much, but if you can awaken people, it will break the chains in their head that they need to obey monsters.  And that is all they need, that is all the monsters need, for people to think they are worth less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember there are no accidents. Don&#39;t give up on trying to wake people up, but don&#39;t be discouraged by the ones who can&#39;t. Just rejoice in the ones who can and let the others go. Stress is nothing but negative energy which breeds negative energy so don&#39;t dwell or you will be doing harm to yourself. Don&#39;t avoid it either, negative is the yang of the yin of positive and both depend on the other. You cannot have positive without negative, just like you cannot have light without dark, its the duality of life. </p>

<p>Think of it this way, whether through death by grid collapse, or dying of old age, we all go to the same place. We are luminous beings having a physical experience here on earth. If you see this as truth then there is no saving, instead they are living a different experience than you, but will have the same outcome. After all, death is as much a part of life as birth, and no two deaths are the same because no two lives are the same. </p>

<p>Now moving backwards to your first point, I don&#39;t see it as obvious that the world is ending. I do see how society may be on the brink of ending, but that would be the best thing for all involved, after all those in control could not be in control if we did not have the society we have. So if you look at the world as going through a change instead of coming to an end you will see that there is more to look forward to than to dread. Most people will not survive, or wake up, but that is because they could not survive with the coming changes as they are too dependent on the current system. </p>

<p>Life is change, you cannot stop it, you cannot get everyone to accept it, you can&#39;t even get everyone to survive it. All you can do is live it and hopefully not lose the lesson, after all the only thing you can take with you is the knowledge you gain. </p>

<p>Hope that helps, and remember, be thankful for every experience in life, you gain more knowledge from failure than you ever do from success. So when you lose in life just don&#39;t lose the lesson. Each person you cannot wake up is knowledge you gain to help the next one and increase your chances. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a choice you have, but not an uncommon one, the ones on the other side don&#39;t need to be woken up though, just here. You would lose all those chances of waking up others to the truth. Think of how exhilarating it is to wake up another, and realize you would never feel that again. If not for the love of nature at least stay for the love of truth. </p>

<p>Added: We need all the help we can get. </p>

<p>Edit: Sorry I miss read your comment, I was not trying to say your mission should be to wake people up, I was commenting on you doing it and it being invigorating. </p>

<p>But if you don&#39;t try to wake people up, then what is the point of your post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not, the media is just the propaganda arm for the government.  There will be a change, but not nearly as bad as OP is ranting about.  Why is it that everyone thinks they are going to survive whatever apocalypse?  &quot;99% of the population is going to die but me and my buddy Bubba spent a weekend digging a hole so we are going to be ok&quot;  Face it, you are going to die like the rest of the planet.  That&#39;s the thing about life, none of us are getting out of here alive.</p>

<p>Now, I do think you need to take enjoyment from whatever you can.  Can you honestly say that everything you hear from Alex Jones or David Icke is 100% true?  Fluoride is a mind control agent, Reptile aliens are controlling the world, Airliners are pumping chemicals out 30,000 feet up to control you?  There is not one thing you hear and think, &quot;That&#39;s not right!&quot;</p>

I am of light, but my battle with darkness is long from over. Honestly, I apologize for saying those negative things. That is not who I truly am and it is not what I stand for.</p>

<p>Know that if you truly seek the light, do not turn your attention outwards, but inwards. For we are in the universe the same way that the universe is in us. We are all that we see, every sound we hear and every person we meet. We are all one being, split into many for the search of meaning and truth in all things. Your mind holds the key to unlocking the most amazing and awesome secrets known to consciousness. If your intentions are pure, the light will give you knowledge, bit by bit until you have a picture. Then you can step back, take a look at the picture and marvel in the beauty of it all, then all your fears will just vanish.</p>
