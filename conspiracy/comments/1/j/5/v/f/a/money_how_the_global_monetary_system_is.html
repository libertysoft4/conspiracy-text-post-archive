<p>“The study of money, above all other fields in economics, is one in which complexity is used to disguise truth or to evade truth, not to reveal it. The process by which banks create money is so simple the mind is repelled. With something so important, a deeper mystery seems only decent.” -Jonathon Galbraith, Former Harvard Economics Professor </p>

<p>“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and money system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” - Henry Ford</p>

<p><strong>Fractional Reserve Banking</strong></p>

<p>Fractional Reserve banking <a href="http://mises.org/Books/Mengerprinciples.pdf">originated many centuries ago, before the existence of governmental monetary authorities</a> such as the Federal Reserve or the Swedish Riksbank, the oldest Central Bank in the world established in 1668. Even before the existence of institutions which now resemble modern banks. It originated with Goldsmiths; precious metal owners would keep their deposits within the confines of the smiths&#39; safekeeping depositories, and in exchange they received a note of deposit which was accepted as currency in trade. Early on, the smiths noticed that very few people would ever exchange their notes for gold at the same time, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking#History">began issuing more notes than they had gold reserves as a form of income</a>. It was this action that transformed the goldsmiths from passive holders of metal currency to interest earning banks, and Fractional Reserve Banking was born.</p>

<p>In the 1600s, Governments began establishing Central Banks, which were granted the legal authority to set reserve requirements and to issue the &#39;monetary base&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Reserve Requirements</strong></p>

<p>The United States Federal Reserve has a &#39;reserve requirement&#39; 10% (3% for institutions with under $79.5 million in total accounts).</p>

<p>What this means functionally in the United States:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A bank will receive a deposit of $100</p></li>
<li><p>They will put $10 aside as per the &#39;reserve requirement&#39;, and loan out 90 dollars to another person.</p></li>
<li><p>After financial transactions take place, the 90 dollars will end up in another bank. This bank will put 9 dollars in reserves and loan out 81 dollars to a new person.</p></li>
<li><p>The process repeats until there are 1000 dollars now in the banks&#39; books, with only 100 having been deposited originally. In addition, banking institutions earn interest on all of these loans, reaping profits on all 1000 dollars in new money creation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Interest</strong></p>

<p>Lets take an example of a mortgage. If someone wants to buy a house, they will need to take out a loan. For this example, the loan is $200,000, and the interest rate is 7.5% fixed interest, and the time frame is 30 years.</p>

<p>What this means functionally:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Interest is usually computed monthly, so 7.5% divided by 12 is .625. </p></li>
<li><p>Every month, you will pay .625 in interest on the mortgage, and then pay off some of the principle, that is, the actual money you owe.</p></li>
<li><p>For the first month, you will pay .625% of 200,000, which is $1,250.</p></li>
<li><p>But this is only the interest payment. On top of that you will pay off some of the principle, the actual mortgage.</p></li>
<li><p>To pay off 200,000 with even payments each month over 30 years, ~555 would be the payment. However, banks will often structure the payments so the money going towards principle starts out small and gradually increases. Likewise, the payment on interest will gradually decrease as the principle gets smaller each month.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless, the person who took out the loan will end up paying more in interest than they originally received in their loan, paying back between $400,000 and $500,000 in total depending on how the deal was structured.</p>

<p>Without context this is disturbing, and some will try to justify it, citing &#39;bank risks&#39; or other talking points, but when you understand fractional reserve banking, how the bank is profiting immensely off of this money not just with the person who took out the mortgage but also with nearly a dozen others, all without producing goods or services, simply with a few clicks of a button, and how money is debt, the bigger picture starts to become clear. But there is still a lot more context to add.</p>

<p>I will return to this mortgage example soon.</p>

<p><strong>Who owns the Federal Reserve?</strong></p>

<p>(ex)Congressmen, Dennis Kucinich, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2KBpqiORkU">once claimed</a> that &quot;The Federal Reserve is no more federal than the Federal Express&quot;. How true is this claim? The skeptic communities will admit to the Fed being privately owned, but point to the fact that policy is partially governed by the Federally-appointed Board of Governors as evidence that it operates in the interest of the American people. The actual policy setting committee is the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the 7 members of the Board of Governors and 5 Federal Reserve Bank presidents (The other 7 Federal Reserve presidents attend meetings and participate in discussions but do not vote). It is important to note that the President is required by law, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section%2010.htm">as per section 10 of the Federal Reserve Charter</a>, to &quot;have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests... of the country&quot; in his Governor appointments (And I want to emphasize, these are appointed officials, not elected officials. Not one person involved in monetary policy is elected by the people). Once appointed, Governors are entirely independent and cannot be removed due to their policies. The FMOC meets 8 times a year and its minutes are secret. Their decision is only meant to &quot;provide guidance to the Manager in the conduct of day-to-day open market operations&quot;, where &#39;manager&#39; refers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri2.htm">according to federalreserve.gov</a>. Beyond these 8 meetings a year which set guidelines, the 12 Federal Reserve banks operate independently and are owned privately. <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section5.htm">Specifically, they are owned by other banks</a>, who are considered &#39;member banks&#39;, which amount to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Federal_Reserve_Banks">40% of the banks in the United States.</a></p>

<p><strong>Money is Debt</strong></p>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.economist.com/content/global_debt_clock">Global Debt Clock</a> over at The Economist. Apparently, the world is 50 trillion dollars in debt.</p>

<p>Who owns all this debt? To answer the question, we need to answer &#39;where does money come from?&#39;</p>

<p>All money originates from banks. Either a commercial bank creates money through fractional reserve banking, or the Federal Reserve creates it.</p>

<p>When the US Government wants to create more money, they exchange Treasury Bonds for Federal Reserve Notes, what we know as money (&#39;Federal Reserve Note&#39; is affixed on the top of our bills, indicating who owns the money process). This creates government debt, and most of the time, money isn&#39;t even created, it is simply &#39;electronically credited&#39;. To print money, the Federal Reserve only needs to pay the physical cost of the printing.</p>

<p>Every country in the world, with the exception of North Korea, Cuba and Iran, operate this way with private central banks.</p>

<p>It is not a coincidence that the <a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">US Dollar has lost 95% of its value since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913</a>. The government has to create more debt to pay off interest, thereby creating more interest.</p>

<p>The United States government pays about $450 billion per year for interest. </p>

<p>You can trace back the $50 trillion dollars of global debt back to a variety of institutions, but ultimately they all trace back to a private central bank. This is why the US National Debt of ~16 trillion will NEVER be repaid, and any politician who claims to have this as part of their platform without also having massive reform of the monetary system, is either intentionally dishonest or underinformed.</p>

<p>By the very nature of private central banks and the process of money creation, there will always be more debt than there is actual money.</p>

<p><strong>Fiat Currency</strong></p>

<p>In 1971, Richard Nixon unilaterally made the move to officially sever all ties of the US Dollar to gold. I say officially because the Gold Standard effectively ended in practice in 1933, when <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-21/how-franklin-roosevelt-secretly-ended-the-gold-standard.html">FDR unilaterally required all citizens to turn in their gold to the Federal Reserve</a> and stopped accepting certificates in exchange for gold. By 1971, between the full escalation of the Vietnam War, whose cost was nearing 100 billion dollars and the bloating programs of Johnson&#39;s Great Society, it was clear that the United States was spending more money than there could possibly be in gold reserves.</p>

<p>Understanding that there is nothing tangible backing the dollar is important to the big picture of how our monetary system is a scam.</p>

<p>I have written an in depth analysis of the Petrodollar, how the stability of the US Dollar is now tied to the international pricing of Oil on the dollar, <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/understanding-petrodollar-means.html">here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Back to the Mortgage Example, Briefly</strong></p>

<p>When the bank gave out the original $200,00 loan, we can say that they have created $200,000 dollars through fractional reserve banking. However, between $400,000 and $500,000 was repaid to the bank. How does this work, exactly? The recipient of the mortgage must compete on the market for those other ~$250,000 from an intrinsically scarce money supply, and therefore, someone else (or more accurately a combination of people) must lose ~$250,000 dollars on the market.</p>

<p>The combination of interest and debt means the money supply must grow continuously for the system to work. In addition, interest takes money out of circulation, causing money to circulate slower, again requiring more money to enter the system.</p>

<p><strong>The Web of Ownership</strong></p>

<p>For those who are interested, <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf">here is a fascinating study of bank and corporate ownership</a>. The methodology was datamining the Orbis Marketing Database, containing information on more than 30 million economic actors. It was published in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228354.500-revealed--the-capitalist-network-that-runs-the-world.html#.Ue4cULU3tq8">New Scientist</a> (the article linked goes into the details I lay out here), a respected and mainstream publication.</p>

<p>The study identified the top 1,318 transnational companies, mainly banks, and found some fascinating characteristics.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Between them, they generated 20% of global revenues</p></li>
<li><p>The ownership of these 1,318 mainly came from other owners within the group of 1,318.</p></li>
<li><p>These 1,318 companies collectively owned through their shares most of the other 40,000 firms, representing a further 60% of the global revenues, for a combined 80%.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From the article: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When the team further untangled the web of ownership, it found much of it tracked back to a &quot;super-entity&quot; of 147 even more tightly knit companies - all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity - that controlled 40 per cent of the total wealth in the network. &quot;In effect, less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,&quot; says Glattfelder. Most were financial institutions. The top 20 included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, and The Goldman Sachs Group.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It is not a hyperbole to say that the global financial system is one connected system, controlled top-down, with a global elite controlling a vast majority of the worlds wealth. The handful of owners of this economic web are the owners of the member banks of the Federal Reserve and other private central banks.</p>

<p>There are two types of people in this world, those who have debt, and those who own it. The latter have constructed a system that both is beneficial only to themselves and is unsustainable. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll post Part II, examining specific, modern examples of economic hegemony and corruption, probably this afternoon. Thanks for reading. As always, input and criticism is appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin certainly does spice up the competition a bit, but the cultist bitcoin philosophy, one that contends that bitcoin can be a one-world currency (which makes things worse than they already are in terms of mass-manipulation) and that everyone should use Tor (a technology developed and primarily funded by the US government) is highly cringe-worthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not functionally decentralized any more than ICANN at this point, mining will eventually be done by the richest corporations only, and presently a handful of people (attempt to) control the majority of activity (including price). I agree that in theory, bitcoin is awesome! But in practice, it hasn&#39;t really been much of anything other than a proof of concept. I hope the community will grow smart and move away from &quot;foundations&quot;, anonymous services, and those who seek to centralize (exchanges, forums, etc) but I understand it&#39;s going to take a massive effort and plenty of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe the gold markets aren&#39;t manipulated and that bitcoin isn&#39;t currently easy-to-manipulate socially and economically? As I said, I have hope for the future assuming everyone is paying attention, but the present ain&#39;t lookin&#39; so hot as more people follow the word of others blindly, trust companies like MtGox, centralized &quot;foundations&quot;, etc. It&#39;s kind of a joke to people who wanted to use Bitcoin as a truly decentralized store of value.

    <div class="md"><p>Mtgox and the BitcoinFoundation are not Bitcoin. The gold market has manipulators. That&#39;s my point. Markets always have manipulators. Bitcoin is as good as gold.

    <div class="md"><p>MtGox and Bitcoin Foundation represent the manipulators and they all hold a majority influence (individually and through their business operations). What do you call it? Completely decentralized?</p>

<p>As for looking for governments to be my nanny, it&#39;s quite the opposite-- I&#39;m waiting for bitcoiners to stop &quot;needing&quot; foundations and exchanges so that bitcoin can <em>actually</em> begin to be useful instead of just a mockery of its original intention.</p>

<p>Fractional Reserve Banking/ Reserve Requirements: Wikipedia</p>

<p>Interest: Anthony Migchels via realcurrencies.wordpress.com</p>

<p>Who Owns the Federal Reserve?: federalreserve.gov</p>

<p>Money is Debt: No research needed except to find the world debt total.</p>

<p>Fiat Currency: Wikipedia, Google for the history of the Gold Standard, led me to Bloomberg.com</p>

<p>Web of Ownership: I found the link to the study on the web of ownership from Anthony Migchels at realcurrencies.wordpress.com</p>

<p>None of these concepts are new so there are likely dozens of authors out there who have said pretty much the same things I have said here. My purpose for writing this was to put them all into one cohesive and coherent post.</p>

<p>I have not heard of Bill Still. I do provide a link to realcurrencies.wordpress.com on my website.</p>

<p>Edit: And I want to stress that the last thing I want to do is plagiarize, I plan on turning this work along with my other writing into a thesis for my masters degree so anything plagiarized is a huge no-no. I will always be open to discussing where I got my information, and which writing influenced my own writing. Can you provide evidence of the &#39;word-for-word&#39; similarities? </p>

<p>Just to be clear, the banks also owe 1000 dollars to depositors and have to pay interest on all 1000 dollars  to depositors (except for the small portion of deposits  in non-interest-bearing accounts).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they are. It all comes down to this: there will always be more debt than money, via the very nature of money creation from central banks. </p>

<p>Every dollar in the world is owed back to them, at interest. To pay off interest, more money needs to be created. Money that is owed back, at interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing impossible about it. Fundamentally, paying interest on money borrowed isn&#39;t different from paying for something you rent--a car, an apartment, whatever. You can pay the rent or the interest from your income. If all the loans are paid off, that&#39;s it. Nothing more is owed. If you stop renting an apartment, you&#39;re done paying rent.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t true that all money is owed back to central banks. The money
supply is much bigger than that.</p>

<p>Also, bank notes (including Federal Reserve notes), represent a debt
that the bank owes to the holder of the note, not vice versa. See, for
example, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bsd-overview-201305.htm">this balance sheet</a>,
where outstanding Federal Reserve notes are counted as a <em>liability</em> to
the Federal Reserve Banks.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t pay interest to the Federal Reserve based on Federal Reserve
notes, they pay interest to us...sort of. The Federal Reserve pays a lot
of money to the federal government each year. Technically, the money is
labeled as &quot;interest on Federal Reserve notes&quot; (see the 11th column in
<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report/statistical-tables/2011-statistical-table-11.htm">this
table</a>),
but it&#39;s not actually calculated as a percentage of outstanding notes.
Instead, <em>all the profits</em> from the Federal Reserve system (after
expenses and a dividend paid to member banks) go to the federal
government.</p>

<p>The federal government does pay interest to the Federal Reserve for the
treasury bonds and treasury bills it owns, but the Federal Rerserve only
owns a small percentage of all of those (about 10 or 11 percent, the
last time I checked).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is significantly more debt than there is money. <a href="http://dollardaze.org/blog/?post_id=00762&amp;amp;cat_id=20">Global Money Supply of 75 trillion</a> vs global debt of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/05/11/number-of-the-week-total-world-debt-load-at-313-of-gdp/">223 trillion</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve pays a lot of money to the federal government each year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is true that the Federal Reserve pays the treasury but the amount is almost always less than the interest received on interest from government securities, as seen <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual07/sec6/c3.htm#t2">here on the second column</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally, paying interest on money borrowed isn&#39;t different from paying for something you rent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is kind of getting to the gist of it... ultimately all money is borrowed into existence, so we are just renting it, from a handful of elite that reside at the top of the pyramid a la the study linked in my post.</p>

<p>In other news, the government spends <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/11/19/how-the-nations-interest-spending-stacks-up">$220 billion per year</a> of taxpayer money paying interest on the federal debt. The Gov only spends more on defense and medicare/caid each year.</p>

<p>And what it comes down to is that, the federal reserve owns every US dollar in existence. It even says on the dollar bill, legal tender for all debts, and every dollar, whether it was loaned out to member banks or to the government via bonds, is created and released by the Fed with interest attached.</p>
