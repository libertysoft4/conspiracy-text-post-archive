<p>I&#39;ll just copy the rest of my thoughts on this from another thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s retarded in every conceivable way.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks the &quot;Illuminati&quot; is now anything more than a pop-culture icon for rappers to not-so-subtly reference in their shitty videos, needs to reassess how they process information. Y&#39;know, maybe try adding some of that pesky &#39;evidence&#39; and &#39;logic&#39; stuff into the process.</p>

<p>If you want people to take the shit that is posted here more seriously, you need to stop with this crap. You may as well have put up a picture of a Jew with reptile eyes stepping out of a flying saucer holding Obama&#39;s birth certificate.</p>

<p>Last time i checked, this sub was supposed to be about truth and evidence, not the bullshit fantasies of people who read more memes here than they do articles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assumed these sorts of stereotypes are what we here are looking to fight against, rather than perpetuate. If this is the image that is being put across, and the overwhelming majority of people are comfortable with this, then maybe i&#39;m in the wrong place.</p>

<p>I hope you wouldn&#39;t stop until this shit gets changed.

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day a minor shit-storm has taken place because the moderators here thought the new layout was something different and worked for the sub. </p>

<p>enfrozt developed the idea with my input and central image choice (as well as the MIB reddit aliens) </p>

<p>Long and short of it is that if users and subscribers or r/conspiracy really do not like the new layout i will get it changed back to how it was.</p>

<p>Me and a number of other moderators got attacked as soon as the new design went live (because the sub had to be turned to private mode for five minutes.)</p>

Unintentional or not, the image <em>will</em> be seen as bait by the usual shills intent on corralling all those interested in alternate visions of the news along with rabid racists and antisemites. </p>

<p>We might like it or not but the Seeing Eye IS a very important, recognizable motif of the whole &#39;conspiracy&#39; field; it MIGHT alienate many due to the current pop culture (ab)use of it, though. How about a compromise, just get rid of the inverted copy on the background and let it alone like that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. It&#39;s the exact same way when you have to filter through the bullshit posts and find the decent ones, but i just think if the whole idea of this sub is to hopefully enlighten people as to how the world really works, having that staring at them is a massive contribution to the whole <em>&quot;Oh look, here we go...&quot;</em> attitude that people generally have when you even mention the word &#39;conspiracy&#39;.

<p>An enormous percentage of our population still think there was a garden of Eden, that Noah built an ark, and Jonah lived in a fish for three days. The list of things society has been wrong about is enormous. </p>

<p>The subjects discussed here shouldn&#39;t be taken as a fucking hobby. It isn&#39;t &#39;interesting&#39;, it&#39;s important. If you want exciting fantasies, go read Lord of the Rings. </p>

<p>And lets take it a bit further - you say conspiracy related topics?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>con·spir·a·cy</strong>
/kənˈspirəsē/
Noun</p>

<ul>
<li>A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.</li>
<li>The action of plotting or conspiring.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If there&#39;s no evidence of any of this, then it isn&#39;t &quot;conspiracy related&quot;, it&#39;s fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After thinking about our conversation for moment, (and smoking a bowl) I realized I didn&#39;t like where it ended. Listen, you seem like a reasonable person. I totally get where you are coming from with changing the banner, it does imply the stereotypical conspiracy theorist mantra. I totally understand why you would like to avoid that in this sub. </p>

<p>I think what we disagree on, is the audience of this sub. You are looking at it from the mainstream looking in. You are concerned with the mainstream&#39;s notion of conspiracy. You are wanting to make a difference in the world by waking people up to real conspiracies like Benghazi, government surveillance, and general corruption and tyranny. This is a noble adventure. </p>

<p>However, I am looking at from the conspiracy theorist side. I feel like this is our own little war room. The mainstream does not spend that much time here. There are only 168 thousand subscribers. This sub, like the side bar says is thinking ground. Almost anything goes, except attacking others. If you can&#39;t talk about the Illuminati here, you can&#39;t talk about it anywhere. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get into a debate about whether or not the Illuminati is real, but can you just explain <a href="http://imgur.com/AlyT3E7">this</a>. In my opinion, it&#39;s a topic that should be discussed with an adult mindset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. Like i said, my issue isn&#39;t with the topics being discussed in the sub (as you pointed out, if people can&#39;t discuss things like the Illuminati and UFOs here, then where can they), my issue is when we decide to put such a strong icon there to essentially represent the content of the sub. I&#39;d have <em>almost</em> the same issue if it was a huge picture of the twin towers burning, and i believe without a shadow of a doubt that was an inside job. It needs to be more subtle and less imposing/intimidating. </p>

<p>And for the record, i don&#39;t doubt for a second that a secret society/group known as the Illuminati, at some point, may have had some powerful influence over certain aspects of society. Do i think they&#39;re relevant any more? No. In fact, even if they were, i don&#39;t particularly care - i&#39;ve said it before - i don&#39;t have much interest in what groups these people of power belong to, i care about their actions. My issue with this subject in particular, is that while it is touted as being an important one, i have never <em>once</em> seen anything other than speculation about symbolism in the media (mostly by the half-wits that inhabit the popular music industry), and i have never seen any real evidence of any particular people belonging to this group that supposedly runs the world. To me, it just looks like a way of dumbing down the problems we face today. It&#39;s just too easy of an answer. Of all the inappropriate things to have as the header for this sub, this isn&#39;t one of the better ones.</p>

<p>This hit me as being extremely relevant when it was the sidebar image. I don&#39;t think the formatting would fit, but something along those lines i think would be great. It&#39;s not fear-mongering or preachy, just kind of clever. Although it might come across as a bit patronising, so i&#39;m sure there&#39;s something better out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be good for the sidebar. Banners are somewhat tough. I just made <a href="http://i.imgur.com/C9t6IdD.png">this</a> in photoshop, it&#39;s something along the lines of what I was thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever dude. You can think what you want, but it&#39;s not going to change this forum. </p>

<p>Somethings are entertainment, somethings are important, and somethings are downright lunacy. It all meshes together in this forum, and I like it. Anyone wanting change it automatically receives backlash from me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day a minor shit-storm has taken place because the moderators here thought the new layout was something different and worked for the sub. </p>

<p>enfrozt developed the idea with my input and central image choice (as well as the MIB reddit aliens) </p>

<p>Long and short of it is that if users and subscribers or r/conspiracy really do not like the new layout i will get it changed back to how it was.</p>

<p>Me and a number of other moderators got attacked as soon as the new design went live (because the sub had to be turned to private mode for five minutes.)</p>

<p>If we change the style back this would probably have to happen again. Just so readers are aware. </p>
