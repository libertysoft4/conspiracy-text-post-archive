    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget what he hit before striking the tree. Many have theorized that it was the big ass metal backflow prevention valve and the steel security cage bolted to the cement slab that actually started to dislodge the engine <em>before</em> the tree was struck.</p>

<p>In the picture that was taken shortly after they removed the car the cage had been placed back there by crash scene investigators after photographing it in the location almost as far down the street as the engine was found. It didn&#39;t travel as far as the engine due to less mass, but it and the pipe were both down the street in the same direction the engine was found in.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/qRBzqgm.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/qRBzqgm.jpg</a></p>

<p>Hitting a metal pipe sticking out of the ground and a big steel cage bolted over top of it at 45-80 miles per hour can wreak havoc on the car. Looking at the tire tracks that were visible before all the pilgrims started tromping through to pay their respects it is clear that the front tire passed to the right of the pipe and the back tire passed to the left, showing that the car was steering back towards the street but sliding at the same time, although it was angled just ever so slightly.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/gzVtUkE.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/gzVtUkE.jpg</a></p>

<p>This also explains why the front driver&#39;s side tire was ripped off and deflected to the right instead of following the path the engine ultimately took. It actually struck the right side of the pipe.</p>

<p>You think in a city of 3.8 million people and mere blocks from a Santa Monica Blvd. commercial district that there wouldn&#39;t be enough water pressure for one man to run a hose at the same time a backflow prevention valve was venting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you should be aware of the difference between domestic water supplies of potable water and the non-potable use irrigation systems. Los Angles has maintained a non-potable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water">reclaimed water irrigation system since 1929</a> for things like parks and golf courses, or the grassy median strip where the accident happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my Q.</p>

<p>Hastings hit the tree head on right?<br/>
An engine is typically in the fornt of a car, right?  (it was in this case)
how did the engine get from Point A (his car) through point B (the tree) all the way to point C (100+ feet away from the car)?</p>

<p>EDIT. its a fricken engine, theres no scratches on the ground or chips in the street? Did the engine land exactly where it was found or did it fly out and skid? Simple questions break down complex lies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but isnt the engine essentially in the center of the car? even if its off-center a bit, its still large enough to cross the &quot;middle line&quot; of the car. Plus the camshaft was still attached aswell, which adds even more length. he didnt merely hit the tip corner of the car (obviously) as that would have made him spin out, so he hit it frontal enough to come to a complete stop instantly.  </p>

<p>I keep looking at pictures of his brand of Mercedes and i cant seem to see how an engine can go through or around the tree. but im not a physicist or a detective but it makes no sense to the common man like myself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>firstly, i imagine you&#39;re talking about the DRIVEshaft, the camshaft is a part of the engine. </p>

<p>he did hit the corner of the car. that&#39;s what a front offset collision is. it doesn&#39;t make you &#39;spin-out&#39;, it usually makes the car rotate 90 degrees, if it&#39;s a solid hit, which it was. </p>

<p>the engine didn&#39;t go THROUGH a tree, that would be silly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ0laKiCkfk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ0laKiCkfk</a></p>

<p>there&#39;s a video that will show you exactly how his wreck played out. this video is of a test conducted at 40 MPH. hastings was going 80-100 MPH. </p>

<p>if you look at where the engine and debris is, you should see that it&#39;s in the right place. the road is uneven, it&#39;s very possible that his car began to skip, and may not have been facing straight when he hit. probably a little off angle. </p>

<p>my source: i&#39;ve been a mechanic for years, specifically in collision repair. </p>

<p>to me it&#39;s a waste of time to talk about a normal car wreck as if it&#39;s some mystical thing. </p>

<p>wrecking cars is a science. this one was no different. i can tell it was a high speed wreck, but other than that fairly normal, from the after math of the damage. all the evidence of what happened is laid out in plain sight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s no outrage because it&#39;s a stupid thing to be outraged over. </p>

<p>you think just a mercedes does that? any car in a 100 MPH front offset collision is capable of that. cars smash when they hit shit. when they hit at 100 MPH they really smash.</p>

<p>also, most missles go farther than 150-200 feet. </p>
