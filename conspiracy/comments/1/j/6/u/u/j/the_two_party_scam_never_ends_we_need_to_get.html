<p>personally i think removing lobbying and other stealth bribery from all levels of the political process, along with a complete reboot of all members of house and senate + 2 term limits is realistically possible and would be transformational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that the existence of political parties effectively disenfranchise voters, and that voters will only be able to understand this if they leave them? Or are you just saying that a person who leaves a party will be effectively disenfranchised in doing so?</p>

<p>In either case, election reform is unlikely to kill off political parties. Parties exist in some form or another in pretty much every country that doesn&#39;t actively repress them. Reform could do something to remove laws that formalize certain aspects of the party system (for example, having to actually vote electors to the electoral college, as opposed to simply voting for the presidential candidate with the elector being a mere technicality), but the reality is that political parties have been at the forefront of electoral politics since nearly the country&#39;s inception (While there were definitely founding fathers who opposed parties, it wasn&#39;t long before the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans were the primary political forces).</p>

<p>Now, election reform could reduce the prominence of political parties, but probably not below to the level you see in most parliamentary systems. The main issue is the immense role election of the president plays in election proceedings. When you are electing a single person to a significantly powerful position, two candidates have a natural tendency to dominate the field - if you&#39;re supporting Larry 3rd Place (a hypothetical candidate who has consistently polled lower than two other candidates such that his chances of election are statistically negligible), your vote is meaningless, because Larry 3rd Place doesn&#39;t have a chance of winning. You&#39;re better off looking at the two more popular candidates and picking whichever one disagrees with you the least, because then your vote has a higher chance of promoting the kinds of policies you want. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, there can be exceptions (three or more candidates can, of course, all seem to have similar levels of support throughout an election), but the reality is that the case of two front runners is one that tends towards self-perpetuation - you identify with a candidate, you (and others) identify with their party, the party&#39;s visibility and influence grows, and so on, while the less prominent parties suffer from the opposite.</p>

<p>Basically, as long as we elect a president, we&#39;re probably going to see two parties dominate. Even if we don&#39;t, and switched to a more parliamentary system, we&#39;d probably still have a system with a few dominant parties, and a few smaller ones.</p>

<p>Now, more realistically, things like having debates be federally regulated so that third party candidates have a better chance of being represented, as opposed to being organized by the major parties themselves, is thinkable. However, that&#39;s an issue no major party has any reason to support, and an issue that most voters probably don&#39;t give a rats ass about. Get enough people riled up about it though, and it could probably happen - hell, even without reform, a suitably popular candidate can and has done it (though not since Perot).</p>
