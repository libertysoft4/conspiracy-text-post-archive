<p>the Geoengineeringwatch.org website was taken down today by their host without warning. there tech person tells us he has never seen anything like this happen before. He is dealing with it right now. Dane is certain this is not an accident. There have been many phone calls and email communications this week in the course of preparing this data for release. We suspect that the site was shut down to prevent this article from reaching the tens of thousands of you who visit our site daily.</p>

<p>The article, about our findings when testing UV levels is below. These findings are quite alarming. </p>

<p>Geoengineering is Destroying the Ozone Layer</p>

<p>Off The Chart UV Levels Not Being Disclosed</p>

<p>By Dane Wigington
geoengineeringwatch.org</p>

<p>We have known for some time that the UV levels were getting rapidly worse due to the ongoing atmospheric spraying. Anyone that is even slightly awake and aware has noticed that the sun feels incredibly intense on the skin. Most varieties of plant life are showing at least some signs of stress in most areas. In many regions, whole forests are in steep decline. And it&#39;s getting worse by the day.</p>

<p>Although extreme drought and toxic rains (due in large part to the heavy metal fallout from geoengineering) are taking their toll, recent metering of UV levels in Northern California indicate that there is an element in this die off that is far worse than we had realized, an incomprehensibly high level of UV radiation.</p>

<p>With the assistance of a very generous and conscientious individual, geoengineeringwatch.org purchased top-of-the-line UV metering equipment which was put in the hands of a 40-year environmental metering veteran, with 20 years government experience and 20 years as a private consultant. Our findings are far beyond shocking.</p>

<p>From a recent science study on excessive UV:</p>

<p>We are told UV-B is only a minor component of the total solar radiation, we now know this could not be further from the truth. Our recent metering reflects an exponential rise in UVB radiation. Due to its high energy, its potential for causing biological damage to plants, animals, and humans is exceptionally high and even small increases could lead to significant biological damage. There are numerous peer reviewed studies which verify this fact.</p>

<p>The Results</p>

<p>According to agencies like WHO, (World Heath Organizatin) and a long list of other recognized government sources of UV information like NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), no more than 5% of the total UV reaching the surface of Earth should be UVB. The other 95% should be UVA.</p>

<p>These agencies go on to state that UVC should be ZERO.</p>

<p>What has our testing shown?</p>

<p>UVB - the most lethal form of UV radiation - has now escalated to almost 70% of the total UV reaching the surface of our planet. At least this is the case in Northern California. (This can only mean that total Ultra-Violate exposure has also escalated sharply, making overall UVB levels worse still.)</p>

<p>In addition, our testing has consistently shown significant levels of UVC which used to be filtered out by the ozone layer, some 100,000 feet up in our atmosphere.</p>

<p>Not any more.</p>

<p>UV is measured in spectral bandwidths. The higher the bandwidth, the more benign the UV; lower bandwidths are more lethal.</p>

<p>Current testing reveals that almost 70% of incoming UV radiation is currently in the UVB and UVC range. (Not 5% or less, as we are being told by all major agencies and their media mouthpieces).</p>

<p>This translates into nearly a 1,400% increase in UVB as a percentage of total UV. If UVA has also gone up due to the same ozone destruction which has driven up the UVB, this would indicate a likelihood that the total UVB and UVC is higher still - not just a difference of ratio with the same overall number.</p>

<p>What are the known negative effects of excessive UV exposure to plant life?</p>

<p>The Proof On The Ground</p>

<p>In the forests of Northern California, bark is literally being scorched from trees. On many specimens, only a thin strip of bark remains on the shaded side of the tree. Foliage is being scorched with many trees having only a fraction of their normal leaf cover. Many native species of plants are not even sprouting any more. The organisms that do still manage to grow appear miniaturized in some cases.</p>

<p>What are just some of the results of excessive UV exposure to plants?</p>

<p>Can stop sprouting of seeds, • Stunts growth, • Limb die off, • Reduced foliage, • DNA damage, • Changes nutrient distribution, • Mutatins, • Effects photosynthesis • Greatly increased mortality
SOME known effects of excessive UV exposure to aquatic life:
All aquatic life is particularly vulnerable to high UV levels.
Phytoplankton accounts for some 30% of the worlds&#39; intake of animal protein. Phytoplankton and the microorganisms they consume are killed by excessive UV levels. (Global plankton populations have already been reduced by 40% to 50%. Much of the die off is likely due to increased UV radiation.)
Less plankton = less carbon-dioxide absorption.
Less plankton = less oxygen production. (Atmospheric oxygen content around the globe declining rapidly)
Less plankton = less fish. Period.
Bottom line: A crashing plankton population effects the entire food chain and all life on earth.</p>

<p>Excess UV kills coral reefs. So do waters warmed and made acidic by CO2 fallout. (Reefs are the nurseries of many crucial aquatic species and are in sharp decline around the globe.)</p>

<p>SOME of the known effects of excess UV on humans:</p>

<p>• Damaged immune system, • DNA damage • Damages sight • Causes various forms of cancer</p>

<p>Geoengineering Aerosols Destroy The Ozone Layer</p>

<p>This is not speculation, it is fact. There is a mountain of science data that confirms the ozone decimating effect of sunlight-reflecting particulates in the upper atmosphere. As geoengineering climate modeler Ken Caldeira warned after crunching the numbers for Dr. Edward Teller&#39;s aerosol “sunscreen”, the resulting rapid cooling of the stratosphere causes the formation of huge ice clouds that attract and concentrate ozone-destroying chemicals.</p>

<p>In addition, high nitrogen oxide emissions from fleets of aerosol-spreading jet tanker aircraft - and more than 93,000 daily airline flights - directly attack Earth&#39;s protective ozone layer.</p>

<p>Though many of these &quot;science studies&quot; do not admit geoengineering is already going on, this fact is not hard to confirm for any that do even the slightest investigation.</p>

<p>Numerous references are posted below this article.</p>

<p>At A Crossroad</p>

<p>The gravity of our collective crisis cannot be overstated. Current UV metering makes clear we are now being exposed to dangerously high levels of UV radiation, specifically UVB and UVC.</p>

<p>The metering performed in Northern California, on which this statement is based, was done by a pair of identical state-of-the-art, brand-new, science-grade meters guaranteed to be scientifically calibrated to a range within 4%. As stated earlier in this article, the tech who did this metering is a 40- year veteran in environmental measurement and interpretation.</p>

<p>Here in Northern California, we are already seeing frighteningly visible damage to foliage, trees, and plants. The ramifications of extremely high UV levels to all life forms – including us – are grave. As the die-off of other species go, so will we. We are in the 6th Great Mass Extinction – right here, right now! (References below)</p>

<p>If geoengineering continues unabated, and the ozone layer is completely destroyed, it will be game over for us all. No ozone layer = no life on Earth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>Global geoengineering is tearing apart the entire fabric of life on our planet. • Geoengineering is poisoning our air, waters, and soils. • Geoengineering is pushing increasingly erratic atmospheric processes resulting from human-propelled climate change past the Chaos threshold into unpredictable, self-reinforcing, cascading events. • Geoengineering is disrupting the jetstream and all natural weather patterns, which in turn is fueling catastrophic climate feedback loops – the most dire of which are mass methane hydrate releases from the Arctic tundra and seafloor. • Geoengineering is destroying the stratospheric solar radiation shielding, which protects all life on Earth.</p>

<p>Alarmism?</p>

<p>Do your own honest investigation and find out.</p>

<p>Global awareness of these lethal programs is rising quickly, but not fast enough. Its up to all of us to help shine the light on this life-or-death issue.</p>

<p>Every day counts.</p>

<p>From Harvard Magazine
Harvard scientist</p>

<p>The Science paper notes that loss of ice in the Artic threatens to release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane from the soils of Siberia and Northern Alaska, potentially accelerating climate change. The researchers also note that an increasingly cited remedy for climate change—geo-engineering the climate by launching sulfate particles directly into the atmosphere in order to reflect sunlight away from Earth—would accelerate the process of ozone loss by increasing the reactive surface area for the conversion of chlorine to free radical form, as was observed after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.</p>

<p>UVB: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths from 280-320 nanometers produced by the Sun</p>

<p>UVB is a kind of ultraviolet light from the sun (and sun lamps) that has several harmful effects. UVB is particularly effective at damaging DNA. It is a cause of melanoma and other types of skin cancer. It has also been linked to damage to some materials, crops, and marine organisms. The ozone layer protects the Earth against most UVB coming from the sun. It is always important to protect oneself against UVB, even in the absence of ozone depletion, by wearing hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen. However, these precautions will become more important as ozone depletion worsens. NASA provides more information on their web site</p>

<p>UVC: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths shorter than 280 nanometers</p>

<p>UVC is extremely dangerous, but it is completely absorbed by ozone and normal oxygen (O2). NASA provides more information on their web site</p>

<p>GEOENGINEERING WOULD DESTROY THE OZONE LAYER</p>

<p>A Geo-engineering conference was held in Canberra this week see here. ‘Geo-engineering’ is taking radical steps to dramatically and rapidly cool the planet. One of the ideas being discussed at the conference is to fire sulfa particles into the atmosphere, one professor has spoken out about this:</p>

<p>Professor David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne’s School of Earth Sciences, says another ‘pie in the sky’ solution is to shoot sulfur particles in the atmosphere to shield the earth from the sun.</p>

<p>He says that would destroy the ozone layer.</p>

<p>“Ozone depletion would cause more UV radiation which would cause skin cancers – killing people,” he said.</p>

<p>“We know the mechanism for this, because it’s the process that affects the Antarctic ozone hole.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are also a number of people who will not believe that this is happening. The apparent destruction of the Ozone layer is one aspect of this aerosol spraying, and thankfully, there is finally some evidence of the program. But what else is going on? Barium, for example, is extremely harmful to humans, weakens our immune systems and has been used before in warfare to weaken the enemy (sorry for lack of sources haven&#39;t got much time right now). Furthermore, this chemical spraying seems intrinsically linked to weather manipulation as well, which many people think may be linked to HAARP (The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program). In fact here&#39;s two links regarding HAARP and aerosol spraying: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was under the impression that global use of HAARP technology is responsible for thinning the ozone layer by expanding it out into space, where much of it is lost; the global warming meme is how they are covering it up; and chemtrails are their attempt to compensate for it. Barium is a major component of chemtrails, and it pretty much only has one function in science and industry; reflecting ionizing radiation. I have noticed the fruit in my back yard has been burning on the side facing the sun the last couple of years; I assumed the soil is lacking something. It just needs more aluminum and barium nanoparticles apparently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you publish your readings, the name of the professional, make and model of the device, etc?</p>

<p>It would carry more punch of the numbers were corroborated.  Meters are inexpensive on eBay, and while they make lack the precision and accuracy of the expensive meters used in your study, they would suffice to at least somewhat corroborate your readings. I imagine the margin for error of the cheapo devices would not exceed the difference between the &quot;official&quot; readings and your actual readings. </p>

<p>It strikes me as strange to think the numbers are so far from what people are told. We need someone to peer review this info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this post is just hot air. It reports planktonic populations are down by 40% yet algae is hundreds of fold (I.e. 100x) more resistant to UVb and UVc than higher order eukaryotes like mammals. If the photo radiation was culprit for the agal decline we&#39;d all likely already be blind and suffering from 3rd degree burns. I don&#39;t buy any of this. If this were real I believe there would be an immediate announcement. Scientists would not cover this up. If this were real there would be &quot;danger days&quot; just like we report for air quality. On those days people would be advised to stay indoors. I just find this all hard to swallow. That is my professional opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that this is more likely hot air, I must disagree that scientists would not cover this up.</p>

<p>You need only to look at how the USA and Canadian government raised the safe radiation limits on the west coast and suppresses indications of radioactive material in milk on the west coast.  None of this was reported in the media.  In fact, the media does not report on the recently increasing amounts of radiation coming out of Fukushima at all.</p>

<p>I do not hold my breath for the government to save me.  That&#39;s my personal opinion.  :)</p>

<p>Edit:  I suppose it&#39;s actually likely not scientists that are doing the covering up, but the government in the case of Fukushima.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So one person measured UV levels. Why not several independent observers or measurements? Why all the mischaracterized geoengineering assertions? Sure there are emissions, <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/n2o.html">mostly from use of synthetic fertilizers in farming</a>, then by emissions from consumer vehicles and aircraft. The conjecture of California plant life dying off seems a bit unfounded as well. I think it would be pretty well known if plant life around the country or world was failing. A few hot summers doesn&#39;t make a statistical case for UV killing the worlds plant life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brought to you by the same people who produce the lion&#39;s share of war, genocide, and famine; <em>the great work</em> is more important than any particular generation of humanity. Chernobyl (wormwood in olde English) was their epiphany: It proved that nature recovers rather quickly from ionizing radiation; her human parasites, not so much. They may see thinning the ozone layer as the preferable alternative to thermonuclear war, especially if someone above them is actively interfering with that option.</p>
