<p>That&#39;s the nice thing about them. They rotate in and out and everyone claps for the new guy who will be better than the last. There&#39;s no need for a dictatorship. This system allows for the guise of newness while still keeping corporate interests in the back - and most important - seat.</p>

<p>Fall guy with a golden parachute. Just like W., and Clinton, and Bush Sr., and Reagan and so on.</p>

<p>Watch the next election and you&#39;ll have a real blast watching people fall for the next crook.</p>

<p>He&#39;ll be a Republican. How exciting it will be for the people who believe in the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whilst I agree with virtually all of what you say, I do think that Obama is a different puppet from previous White House incumbents. The amount of unconstitutionality that is being forced through on his watch is completely unprecedented, and it really does seem to me that the puppetmasters regard him as expendable, a scapegoat.</p>

<p>They will engineer his impeachment when the time is right, and make sure he gets the blame. They will also ensure that the worst of Obama&#39;s executive orders remain in place for &quot;the next guy&quot; to take maximum advantage of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of his executive powers he is able to ram through unconstitutional executive orders in order to kick start certain policy changes the groups want enacted.</p>

<p>He acts as a shroud for the actions of the house and senate so that it can yet again be two teams pitted against each other once more in the competitive team based democratic system, as he holds the power of veto over congress.</p>

<p>The people who control what happens are the global elitists who own all the banks, control wall street through their dominance of the stock market ( and not just the common mans market like actual owners shares so that they can be on the board of directors for the companies they invest in so they can essentially own them ), and all the fucking land and resources they control.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty much a handful of insidious people who then pass down their agenda through the ranks until it becomes fully implemented within the ranks of the common folk.</p>

<p>This is how they got us to start drinking fluoride in our water. &quot;Hey, what the fuck should we do with all this fluoride waste from making this bomb?&quot; &quot;Fuck, let&#39;s run a PR campaign along with the dental association alleging it&#39;s good for your tooth health even though it&#39;s the wrong type of fluoride for that and it shouldn&#39;t be ingested so the delivery system is completely fucked but that&#39;s the point cause now those fucks will be less healthy AND we can make a butt load off this manufacturing waste.&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR - The system is so completely gamed it&#39;s hard to tell exactly who pulls what strings but you can start to put together pieces of the puzzle when you start to scrutinize the right individuals such as the Rothschilds or the Bush family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, look up the Carlyle group and how both George Bush Sr. and Jr. Have worked for them along with Frank Carlucci and they have had accounts with the Bin-Laden family as well.</p>

<p>This is one way in which the bushes are connected to war profiteering, by having obvious insider knowledge of war and military technology gives them a major hand up when it comes to military investment derivatives and all that shit.</p>

<p>Also do a search on the origins of fluoride introduction to our water supply and view the different types of fluoride, the natural form being calcium fluoride and the one in our water supply being hydrofluoric acid.</p>

<p>There are mountains of evidence to link all of these people to the global shadow elite that control the worlds finances and politics. Just do basic research into each topic and view as many sources as possible, comparing their actual provable data, and not just taking them at their word without being able to support their claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is by design. It&#39;s just easier when you can blame one person for everything and then replace them with another scapegoat after 4-8 years. It&#39;s the people who we don&#39;t elect, that have all the money and power, who control things. They get to blame the revolving door of politicians for their evils and the politicians will happily take the blame for a price. It shouldn&#39;t be this way, but it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same group of people that Eisenhower and JFK warned us about. The military-industrial-media complex. </p>

<p>They selected Obama because they knew about his past (we don&#39;t) and control him like they control many elected politicians, judges and others in positions of power - through blackmail and threats. The puppets gladly make a Faustian trade-off for wealth and the trappings of power, but know that they have sold their souls to some very dark forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very much worth noting.</p>

<p>These things have become so standard for me that I rarely get upset by them any longer. In some ways I&#39;ve become more accepting to the abuses than the average person if only because I expect them as where the average person find these things to be incredible and upsetting. They&#39;re confounded when they&#39;re lied to as where I say, &quot;Yeah, and?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>One longtime Jewish observer of the political scene, who did not want to be identified, said admiringly that &quot;Jews made him. Wherever you look, there is a Jewish presence.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say this is not only an American domestic problem. This is something that every citizen of the world should be engaged in before it is too late (maybe it already is).</p>

<p>Americans have rights that &#39;foreigners&#39; don&#39;t and NSA is working on a global scale. This means that while you might be able to protect some basic rights for Americans the rest of the world does not have such luck. The rest of the world is subjected to surveillance program of a scale that even stasi and kgb couldn&#39;t have imagined. And this information will be used by the US in diplomatic trades. </p>

<p>Thus, in any conflict in the world, the one party that can please the US (maybe access to oil fields, defence contracts etc) might gain access to data from NSA spying on their citizens. This is threatening the integrity of all citizens in the world. </p>

<p>The  main problem is that the leaders of the world might be very happy with this situation. The leaders in my country are not allowed to do what the NSA is doing - buying the information from the US might be a solution around that problem.</p>

<p>This is bigger than most people will see. But George Orwell was not too far behind in 1948.</p>
