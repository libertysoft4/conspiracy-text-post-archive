        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Ancient Civilization Theory has always intrigued me.  It is claimed by some archaeologists, and scholars that human civilization has been around for 50,000 +- years.  </p>

<p>Prehistory has no written record to explicitly tell us what happened in the past. The oldest  record we do have,  the hieroglyphs of the Egyptians and writings of the Sumarians are not agreed upon as to their actual meaning.  So we must draw our conclusions of what happened by what is etched in stone, or buried in earth.  </p>

<p>Here is some proof that man made cities have been around since before 4,000 BCE. as claimed by most of academia;</p>

<p>There are cities found up to 200 feet beneath the surface of the oceans.  The last time water levels were that low was the ice age.<br/>
<a href="http://akensai.com/ancient-sunken-cities/">Underwater City India</a>;
<a href="http://www.thetruthbehindthescenes.org/2010/06/11/underwater-ancient-city/">Underwater City Japan</a>;
<a href="http://todayswhisper.com/bermuda-triangle-underwater-city">Underwater City Bermuda Triangle</a>;</p>

<p>Also water erosion found on ancient monuments (the sphinx) estimated to take 9000 years, putting the pyramids at 7000BCE.
<a href="http://www.robertschoch.com/sphinxcontent.html">Sphinx Erosion</a></p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that demonstrates that, not only has human civilization and engineering been around since long before the Egyptians, but there is also evidence to suggest that we may have been more technologically advance at some point in the past. </p>

<p>Here is one of my favorite movies on the subject.  Draw your own conclusions. Id love to hear what you think to anyone who takes the time to watch this.

<p>There is plenty more... check out Graham Hancock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of these ancient civilizations are predicted to have existed around 10000+ years ago, roughly the same time as the ice caps retreated causing water levels to rise around the world. It all seems perfectly plausible to anyone who believes history should be revised upon the discovery of new evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Early civilizations almost invariably formed in river valleys. It&#39;s not a surprise that flood stories were common. </p>

<p>Genetic evidence indicates that at one time our species dipped down to 5,000-10,000 members and almost died off. If a significant number of them were involved in some flood disaster, a myth of a &quot;world ending&quot; flood would make sense--- it would have seemed that dire if a couple hundred people were killed.</p>

<p>The second idea there is silly speculation on my part, but it&#39;s interesting to think about.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The academic society is saturated in dogma, and is entrenched in itself, it is reluctant to admit it was wrong.  Imagine being an Egyptologist, and studying the accepted model for 40 years... of course they dont want to admit they are wrong and wasted most of their life believing something incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p>The church has rewrote history on multiple occasions (or at least tried).  It is conceivable that they would have suppressed such knowledge, back in the dark ages when they had more influence, because it goes against their teachings.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Throughout the history of modern science, there will be an accepted theory, and then one person will find evidence to contradict the main scientific community.  These people are labeled hacks sometimes for generations, until time passes and more evidence is gathered by independent sources to overturn the major consensus.

<p>The consensus, although false to an extent, is still clutched as truth, simply because of peoples unwillingness to change their beliefs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know how long it took to get to civilization. If you give the same genes enough time, you will get civilization. But for tens of thousands of years before man created civilization, he was just fucking around in the forests. He never made a stone structure or a city, never mind having the same intelligence, the same drives and urges, the same everything.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely that no civilizations preceeded those we have a consensus for. It is also unlikely that human progress was a monotonic upward curve.</p>
