        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like an increased number of people are waking up to the bullshit happening now.  Just a few examples-</p>

<ul>
<li>The increase in recent Marijuana studies explaining the benefits (cancer, Parkinson&#39;s, Crohn&#39;s, the front page one today about social isolation).<br/></li>
<li>The AP investigation by the DOJ</li>
<li>The Benghazi scandal</li>
<li>The government working with Monsanto worldwide, not to mention the Monsanto Protection Act</li>
<li>The recent martial law situation in Boston that even mainstream media can&#39;t deny</li>
<li>The Pentagon saying they want to fight &quot;terrorism&quot; for 20 more years</li>
<li>No budget deals, or foreseeable deals.</li>
<li>The DHS and their army </li>
<li>Massive gun control legislation across the nation</li>
<li>The FBI openly admitting they spy on everyone</li>
<li>A federal judge saying that people&#39;s cell phones can be used to track locations and movements without a warrant</li>
<li>Legislation granting the military the ability to police streets without local or state consent</li>
<li>The INSANE amount of fear- arresting kids for having poptarts shaped like guns in school</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like things are approaching a tipping point.  Like one of these days a story is going to break that makes everyone stop and get mad, cause to me things just keep getting more and more outrageous in terms of what the government thinks it can get away with. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>And why don&#39;t they? And since there is a consensus that they aren&#39;t, doesn&#39;t that implicate them all? Why can this be both obvious to everyone but also OK with everyone for so long? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is probably because there are a lot of news sources but they all come from a very few news companies, so their appears to be a wide consensus even though it all comes from just a handful of people. The general public doesn&#39;t think too deeply into it so if they hear the same thing a few times from the same or different sources, they assume it to be true. </p>

<p>The news outlets are mostly only concerned with the bottom line, and spouting the corporatist propaganda is good for business, or at least it has been up until this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put. If there is going to be a revolution then we are first going to have to change the paradigm of how a revolution is done. I think the general consensus among us conspiracy theorists is that there has to be a way of revolting without killing people and without rioting through the streets like crazed madmen.</p>

<p>The way I see it, we really only have one choice. We have to wait things out and just keep spreading the word until a formidable consensus has been established. Fortunately for us, the power structure has backed itself into a corner. They cannot do another 9/11 style event because, while most average individuals still believe the official story, you can bet that most governments around the world do not. It just wouldn&#39;t have the same effect because of this. So they now have to do these little events like Sandy Hook and Boston which is equally dangerous for them because every time they do a new false flag more and more people are realizing the bullshit that is going on around them. They are slowly being forced to expose themselves.</p>

This while &quot;I&#39;m only one man&quot; attitude has ruined the lives of untold numbers throughout history and allowed evil to plague the world.

    <div class="md"><p>This is is all IMO but, the shadow government started around the 40&#39;s or 50&#39;s.  They had it a pretty good setup in terms of controlling the media, controlling elections, swaying the opinions of the masses, distracting the public.  They even found ways to fund the overthrowing of countries &quot;off the books&quot; (Iran / Contra, etc...). But they are now all old guys.  Old guys don&#39;t know shit about technology.  My dad is a 40 year telecom guy, couldn&#39;t work a Playstation to save his life.  The Internet has really come into it&#39;s own in the last 10 years.  It has basically caught everyone with their pants down...  Actually, it&#39;s more like someone flipped on the kitchen light and cockroaches started scurrying.  <em>They</em> are still running the same game, over and over, expecting the same results.  Not quite understanding what the public knows and why.  &quot;Why should we worry about the public opinion?  We own USA today, and put the lockdown on AOL years ago, the Internet is a fad anyway&quot;. </p>

<p>Tl;dr</p>

<p>Shadow government is now old guys who don&#39;t understand what the Internet is, or how it is relevant in today&#39;s world.</p>

<p>*&quot;According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,&quot; Rumsfeld admitted.</p>

<p>&quot;$2.3 trillion — that&#39;s $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America. To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere $300 million.&quot;*</p>

<p><a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091001defensebudget"><strong>Anyway, here&#39;s a little something extra you can dismiss as not newsworthy</strong></a>:</p>

<p>(Note the bolded below)</p>

<p>&quot;The books are cooked routinely year after year.” Coverage of this rather shocking story is nearly nonexistent given the events of the next day. [US Department of Defense, 9/10/2001; CBS News, 1/29/2002] In April 2002 it will be revealed that $1.1 trillion of the missing money comes from the 2000 fiscal year. Auditors won’t even quantify how much money is missing from fiscal year 2001, causing “some [to] fear it’s worse” than 2000. <strong>The Department of the Army will state that it won’t publish a stand-alone financial statement for 2001 because of “the loss of financial-management personnel sustained during the Sept. 11 terrorist attack</strong>.” [Insight, 4/29/2002] This $1.1 trillion plus unknown additional amounts continues to remain unaccounted for, and auditors say it may take eight years of reorganization before a proper accounting can be done.&quot;</p>

<p>Did you catch that?</p>

<p>&quot;The Department of the Army will state that it won’t publish a stand-alone financial statement for 2001 <strong>because of “the loss of financial-management personnel sustained during the Sept. 11 terrorist attack</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently, these &quot;financial-management personnel&quot; just happened to be in the section of the Pentagon that those crazy Muslim terrorist dudes slammed with an airliner.</p>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t even the first time that the Secretary of Defense mentioned it. Three months earlier, he brought it up <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=1198">in this interview</a>. </p>

<p>And if it was news, show me the coverage from the evening news of September 10th or the morning of September 11th (morning papers are published long before 8 AM).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April 2002 it will be revealed that $1.1 trillion of the missing money comes from the 2000 fiscal year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The entire Department of Defense budget for the year 2000 was only <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Defense_Spending_Trends.png">about $300 billion.</a> They did not lose more than triple their entire budget in one year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Department of the Army will state that it won’t publish a stand-alone financial statement for 2001 because of “the loss of financial-management personnel sustained during the Sept. 11 terrorist attack&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but the Department of Defense as a whole did publish its financial statements, which included the Army&#39;s spending. The team working on reconciling the past statements continued working and had reduced the unknown amount to $700 billion by early 2002:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=43927">Feb. 20, 2002</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...</p>

<p>DoD financial experts, Zakheim said, are making good progress reconciling the department&#39;s &quot;lost&quot; expenditures, trimming them from a prior estimated total of $2.3 trillion to $700 billion. And, he added, the amount continues to drop.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re getting it down and we are redesigning our systems so we&#39;ll go down from 600-odd systems to maybe 50,&quot; he explained.</p>

<p>&quot;That way, we will give people not so much more money, but a comfort factor, to be sure that every last taxpayer penny is accounted for,&quot; he concluded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, that &quot;national security&quot; garbage is something they use quite a bit.  Like spying on AP.  Apparently reporting things is a &quot;threat to national security,&quot; but giving automatic weapons to mexican cartels isn&#39;t... I could definitely see them spinning hacks into a national security issue to gain control of the information online.  If not because of military or government secrets falling into &quot;enemy hands,&quot; because corporate secrets get out and that is a threat to our &quot;recovering&quot; economy.  Because since I&#39;ve started following alternative sources online, I know WAY more about what is actually happening in the world than what Fox, CNN, ABC, NBC, and HLN spoon feed the populace. </p>

For each bullet point you list I dont see it as the house of cards tipping but rather, the need to hide in the shadows or in secret is eroding away for them.

    <div class="md"><p>I can see that.  I&#39;m young (early 20s) so I haven&#39;t really been able to see the normalization that happens in the long term.  The biggest change I&#39;ve seen is from the PATRIOT Act, but even before it I was too young to really remember what it was like.  But the older redditors on here seem to have the same opinion you do, and given history I can definitely see that scenario as well. </p>

<p>My biggest thing comes mostly from the internet.  30 years ago people wouldn&#39;t have heard about Boston until the next day in the papers, unless a relative called them.  Now, I heard about it within minutes.  The ability to transmit information instantly anywhere in the world is a serious threat to the old system of corruption imho, something TPTB are seriously scared of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am skeptical that things are falling apart. It&#39;s possible that things are getting out which shouldn&#39;t be, despite best efforts, but it&#39;s also possible that these things are intentionally allowed to make it to the MSM. Fear is the best means of control. If people are scared of their government and of the world, they&#39;re not only far more likely to submit, but if they refuse to submit they are far more likely to commit irrational behaviors. If, for example, a right wing group tries to &quot;overthrow the government&quot;, that is perfect justification for <em>all</em> of these freedom strippings— &quot;SEE WE TOLD YOU! DOMESTIC TERRORISTS! WE ARE USING SURVEILLANCE AND TAKING AWAY YOUR RIGHTS TO PROTECT YOU!&quot;</p>

<p>Also, it <em>Always</em> seems like shit comes out in the second term. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it is allowed to happen because they want everyone to be infuriated with Obama and push really hard and get really excited for the next guy, whom they will follow blindly for the first term and then start questioning when the MSM tells them they can question things. </p>

<p>The only way America will realize things is if either A) the corporate controlled media with the <em>same</em> goals the the government somehow change their agenda or B) They start thinking for themselves. I am highly skeptical there is a serious number of American&#39;s thinking for themselves and thus I think the most probable explanations are either that this is all part of the plan or the plan is much bigger than this information and it&#39;s exposing is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Very likely.  I&#39;ve thought often that &quot;they&quot; want &quot;us&quot; to know these are false flags and contrived lies, with government sponsorship.  For the sheep, they are controlled.

    <div class="md"><p>No the house of cards isn&#39;t falling apart. Every single president that has taken office has been fallible - and we know for a fact that every single president since at least Kennedy (and perhaps Carter) have been nothing more than paid, corporate employees. Every single one of them has experienced some degree of scandal, some worse than others. They never suffer for these scandals. For example Clinton was responsible for selling Nuclear secrets to China and his administration was responsible for the economic crises we face today (repeal of Glass-Steagall), he was impeached for getting a blowjob. He went on to make stupid amounts of money at speaking events and book sales across the world. None of these people ever do time for their crimes. My point being that these presidents and administrations are throw away - disposable. When the next election cycle rolls around, let&#39;s see how tuned in people are to this house of cards when they continue buying in to the same left right paradigm bullshit they always had. Britain almost got away with it, voting in both conservatives and liberal democrats to share governance but the conservatives have now basically muscled out the lib dems. It&#39;s the same shit every time, no matter what country you are dealing with. These little scandals... it&#39;s just pageantry, whatever bullshit is necessary to get things done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think of it like this - yes, it might be a tipping point, but this tipping point is going to last a while, and it might go either way. I think the house is teetering and starting to crack, but they&#39;re working their damned hardest to keep it standing, and it might work for them, it might not. I don&#39;t think a collapse was part of their plan, but I think they were planning for it. However, there&#39;s only so much you can do, and I think they&#39;re struggling to keep a hold of things.</p>

<p>For those talking about civil war, martial law etc: civil war is a stupid idea. If it gets to that stage, the government is on it&#39;s way down anyway, and it&#39;d be much more sensible to let it fail on its own. There aren&#39;t enough troops to enact nationwide martial law, so they will be interested in controlling key areas such as ports, power stations, major cities, etc etc. </p>

<p>If you want a good indicator, you need to look at the energy sector. That&#39;s what this whole thing runs on. This is the issue: we&#39;ve already hit peak oil, we know that, however, if we can&#39;t fill the gap between the decline of easy-to-get energy with other sources (shale, tar, wind, solar, whatever) and keep up with demand, that will be the major shift and likely collapse that we hear talked about. I think we have a few years before this all plays out yet, so don&#39;t get too worried or excited just yet.</p>

<p>I agree with OP in that things are heading toward a tipping point.  And, once the threshold is breached, the American people will have a decision to make; to dismantle and rebuild the government, or acquiesce and evolve from blind slavery to witting slaves.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t looked into all of these scandals, but I&#39;m keeping up with the mainstream narrative, which is that none of these scandals are that bad.</p>

<p>My impression is that the real scandal is Benghazi (although I can&#39;t say that I know much about it) and that this scandal was diffused by the government admitting to several smaller scandals that distracted the media and caused a circus, but when the dust settles there won&#39;t be much left to incriminate the white house. </p>

<p>At the same time as all these scandals are going on, the mainstream liberal media (Maddow, Stewart, Maher, NYT, WaPo etc.) are all pushing the line that the Benghazi thing is just the Republicans trying to score political points over nothing. </p>

<p>The public is falling for it. Everything will return to normal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. People are too overworked to put any effort or thought into the big picture. The average westerner is too busy trying to just survive, and maintain the Status quo.  And the funny thing is, we think we have it the BEST in the world, and that our society and government/system is superior to all others. We&#39;re arrogant enough to believe we&#39;ve nearly already reached the peak of humanity&#39;s potential, so instead of trying to find new ways to think, and improve society for everyone, we just go about our day to day lives not caring to try. </p>

<p>Now, agree or disagree with her conclusions, but understand that this is huge. The 25-and-below crowd ain&#39;t buying the old bullshit. They&#39;re not with the racism, sexism, or other isms..and they will be running shit in this world very soon. Bad for the old guard, in many ways. I do think people are waking up, and its the younger crowd that&#39;s sparking it. Most people my age(early 40&#39;s) are still stuck in the old world. This is painful for them; But necessary for all of us to evolve. </p>

<p>To take it metaphysical for a moment, we are all evolving. When your vibration increases, the lies of the lower vibration fall apart. This is what we&#39;re witnessing now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Metaphor for &quot;the powers that be&quot; (government, corporatocracy, big banks).  Basically the idea that everything you know to be true only exists because you be <em>actually</em> believe it is true.  You&#39;ve been brainwashed by the government, the media, and schools to think that our current system is the best system the world has ever known.  But nobody mentions the things like </p>

<ul>
<li>US spends more on prisons than it does on education</li>
<li>Our &quot;defense&quot; budget is larger than the next 10 countries combined- isn&#39;t it coincidental that those nations don&#39;t spend as much and are involved in less international conflict?</li>
<li>The US is ~5% of the world&#39;s population, we consume 25% of the planet&#39;s resources, and contribute 30% of the world&#39;s pollution.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>These are small things compared to what kind of statistic or event you would need to get real change to happen now.  But all you need is one big thing for enough people to lose faith in tptb, and then they have nothing but force to try to save themselves (at that point the people have won, because once they do that their system is over). </p>

Get this society to start showing its ugly head and start the cleaning process. Politics will not change, the people will not change, we need a firm smack to the face. We need our asses kicked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the movie Oblivion is analogous to what is happening in America and the World right now.  I just watched it tonight and the message in that movie just gives me goose bumps.  I implore all of my fellows on this sub reddit to watch it!  This is the dawning of the age of the age of Aquarius and 2012 was never suppose to be the end of the world.  It was the end of the Pisces era.  We are now entering the era of enlightenment.  Everyone is waking up.  It is the era in which the truth can no longer be suppressed by TPTB.  Slow and steady (and peaceful) wins the race.  Keep it rolling my brothers and sisters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on almost everything. The only thing is Boston was NOT under martial law. They called every household and recommended we stay inside. We could still go outside, we could still do whatever. The national guard was not armed. Besides that, your totally right</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think Boston was an insidious martial law situation, you are fucked in the head.  People were shooting guns and setting off bombs!  What do you want them to do?  Trust me, they didn&#39;t even HAVE to tell people to stay in their homes, they just did in case some nutjob like you ran out into the street to become famous (and probably dead).  </p>

<p>But they did tell people to stay in their homes? If they didn&#39;t have to, then why did they? </p>
