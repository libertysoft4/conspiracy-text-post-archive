    <div class="md"><p>civil unrest. The economy is still in the shitter, the dollar value is dropping (and thus, inflation is increasing), Jobs are pretty hard to get, people are broke. Add to that the scandals crawling all over the hill, people like elizabeth warren calling people out, and the administration making moves to restrict firearms, and what you have is people trying to survive on little to no money while it&#39;s becoming blatantly obvious that the (for lack of a better term) 1% only care about themselves and their money. The public sees a disconnect between the compassion they feel for on another and the apparent lack of compassion felt by the government who they falsely believed were &quot;there for them&quot;. This makes people unhappy, and sometimes mad. Billions of hollow points are probably the only way they have to defend themselves against the people in a &quot;last resort&quot; scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. If you wanna go back even further, Bush also pushed the Patriot Act through that eliminated the writ of habeus corpus. Now there is no legal recourse for anyone on american soil to be arrested and detained indefinitely without being told why.</p>

<p>Seems a bit backwards to pass these in this order, but.....now it&#39;s getting easier and easier to see that- unwarranted (I&#39;m not using &quot;illegal&quot; because now, it&#39;s not) search and seizure could easily lead to unwarranted arrests and detainment, for prolonged periods, of large numbers of people. Boston was a dry run. Too bad the social media was covering it more honestly than MSM. There must be some way to silence the net when it happens, so they don&#39;t warn people before we get there. This resulting resistance is what those bullets are for...I&#39;d just about bet ya!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, private &quot;security&quot; contractors aren&#39;t actually designed to protect anyone--they&#39;re designed to take military action against targets that, for whatever reason, the hiring agency can&#39;t attack.  So, if you need some war crimes and clean hands, hire these guys to fill up the graves and get under the bus if anyone finds out.</p>

<p>In this instance, however, the government can&#39;t use the U.S. military against it&#39;s own people, but they sure as hell can use Blackwater.</p>

<p>...What? the U.S. Government is going to liquidate it&#39;s own entire military force in lieu of PMCs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again: the U.S. government can&#39;t, in theory, use the military against the U.S. population, and the National Guard isn&#39;t big enough.  So the PMCs can round out the Guard forces.</p>

<p>&quot;Why bother with the PMCs at all? Why not just cut the military loose on the U.S.A.?&quot; you may ask.  Well, the reasons are twofold:</p>

<p>1) If the military is openly mobilized against a domestic population, then there&#39;s no excuse or rationalizing: we&#39;re officially an oligarchical despot state under martial law.  But the Guard and PMCs can always be used under the umbrella of being &quot;for our own protection&quot;, or whatever.  There are a myriad of excuses that they could come up with.</p>

<p>2) It&#39;s going to be hard enough to lie to the National Guard about what is actually going on during domestic occupation.  Can you imagine the logistical nightmare of trying to convince every grunt in every city that what he&#39;s doing is right?  It would be impossible to count on the military&#39;s loyalty.  Ultimately it would be smarter to keep our military deployed and fighting the War on Terrorism (such as it is) outside of American soil while the PMCs corral a largely helpless population.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s past time we recognize that there are entities, organizations, aimed at transforming American society in order to gain control and power. DHS didn&#39;t  just happen, it was preconceived and slammed into place using 9/11 as justification. What has it accomplished? The beginnings of a controlling police state. To whose benefit? Ask yourself why are so many local police chiefs taken to Israel for training? What do they receive training in?  Suppressing political protest among other things. What does TSA do?  Condition the public to obey.</p>

<p>DHS  fits together with all the other actions, to assert control over America for the benefit of the foreign nation that already controls Congress and the White House. The masters of that nation also control the Fed, banks, major corporations.</p>

<p>Our society is being transformed for their benefit and to their ends. We&#39;ve been under attack for half a century, slowly losing battles we didn&#39;t even know we were in. Our once-proud democracy is in deep deep trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not seen the army I have seen the DHS every where. Buildings, train stations, airports to name a few. My point is the DHS is basically an army built to protect the united states. Since the constitution states the military can not patrol are streets they created the DHS to do that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because any American that takes his natural mans rights under the US Constitution is a terrorist toward the bureaucratic monster of the governments rights on the US Constitution.</p>

<p>The common man will always be a terrorist in the government pov. Especially the minute we bred Frankenstein to life (DHS). We have created many bureaucratic rotten monsters though we once thought we were creating good ones. IRS, Federal Bank, CIA, etc... The evil will swallow us first then themselves.</p>
