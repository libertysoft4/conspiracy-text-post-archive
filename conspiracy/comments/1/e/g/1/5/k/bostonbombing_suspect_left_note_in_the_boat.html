<p>Bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds (which he didn&#39;t get till they found him in the boat), finds a pen but no paper, writes a fucking book on fiberglass gel coat <em>with a pen</em>, providing JUST the evidence they needed to solidify his involvement.</p>

<p>Do me a favor-Throw a pen in your pocket, go write on boat...see how long that lasts. I bet that surface is too smooth for a ball point pen to operate more than may a word or two. Of course, then they&#39;ll just say &quot;It was a QUILL PEN! The boat owners wrote poetry on scrolls while pulling tubers in the harbor!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if that is conflicting information or just the FBI agent being lazy in how he described the writing instrument. I have seen markers referred to as pens, it isn&#39;t accurate, but it isn&#39;t very damning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not a fair assumption. People do survive being run over, myself being one of these people (assuming he did in fact run him over). The tone of media reports imply a certainty in Dzhokhar&#39;s message that his brother was dead which just isn&#39;t feasible given the info available to him at the time, if we are to believe the official chronology. Additionally, being caught and dead are also definitely not interchangeable terms. In fact they couldn&#39;t be more different in the context of an event such as this. Some media sources refer to his message waxing lyrical about how &quot;he would not &quot;mourn&quot; his brother for he is in heaven with Allah&quot;. Since when do you mourn someone&#39;s capture? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got the impression that the majority of people do not survive, but I could be wrong. Regardless, it is a fair number, and it would still be plausible for him assume that he killed him. Also, didn&#39;t the first brother supposedly have some sort of suicide vest?</p>

<p>I meant that if he was captured he&#39;s still fairly screwed/might never see his brother again. I wasn&#39;t aware of anything that was in the message, you would right about that part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Majority survive, especially as he started off on the ground and there wasn&#39;t much time to pick up speed.  Adrenaline rush which would have been present also helps tremendously.  So actually his death is unlikely enough to be fishy in that scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I showed my father, a trauma surgeon, the photo of the dead body and he said that the massive amounts of purple bruising (contusion) and oedema in the chest and face are consistent with the crush injuries that one would sustain from being run over by a vehicle. However, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that injury was what killed Tamerlan.  I don&#39;t doubt he was run over, but the official cause of death focussed more on the gunshot wounds to chest and extremities if I recall.<br/>
The content regarding crush injuries (blunt force trauma) seems to be included as a secondary exacerbating factor. The media allegations subsequently appear to have inflated the bit about being run over by a vehicle as an afterthought to fit their other reports. 
I&#39;d be interested to see a copy of the death report to see the exact wording and priority given to each injury type. 
Based on what my father said, I don&#39;t doubt he was run over, but the question remains: by whom? (Eyewitness reports said a Police SUV hit him, others say the brother in the Merc... I suppose we will know, or be fed, more at a later date).</p>

<p>proof of action doesn&#39;t demonstrate intent.  And a video of him putting down a bag(which nobody has seen but which official sources have been very clear exists) doesn&#39;t even prove action.</p>

<p>How many people?  2?  They also had conflicting testimony about who ran over his brother.  According to this witness testimony tamerlan threw a pressure cooker at police who were over 100 feet away?  And how does one person shooting at 40 people who are trying to kill him prove that they did what they are accused of?  You know what would be good evidence here- if the gun Tamerlan supposedly owned and was shooting is proven to be the same gun which killed the MIT officer.  There is supposedly video there too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Russians (a 3rd party to this entire affair) had told the US Authorities about his brother being an extremist some time before?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The russians know the agency is in bed with the extremists over there.  You think this was a warning and not just the russians calling him out?</p>

<p>How do you reconcile these details and discrepancies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Uncle Ruslan&#39;s intelligence connections</p></li>
<li><p><del>The Balkans</del> The Caucuses being an intelligence hotbed for the US</p></li>
<li><p>There were no police wounded in either &quot;shootout&quot; except by friendly fire</p></li>
<li><p>Tamerlan was able to travel as a non-citizen to and from russia, where he participated in a intelligence led &quot;camp&quot;, even though he was on a terror watchlist (the FBI of course claims that he had to be legally taken of of this watchlist because they weren&#39;t able to find any evidence against him)  Supposedly there was an issue with his documents which is why they missed it?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And we can&#39;t forget historical context.  How do you reconcile the details of the 1993 wtc bombing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.getonhand.com/blogs/news/7743337-boston-bombing-suspect-shootout-pictures">this never happened. There are eye witness accounts to the contrary. At the time there were conflicting statements because some poor bastard decided to rob a shop at a similar time or something. There is footage of the guy you are talking about actually handcuffed and on the floor, and he has subsequently been prosecuted for a seperate matter. This link is to eye witness video/pics and an account of someone who watched what happened.</a>.  can you answer my question- at least about the guilty plea part?</p>

<p>If I had a boat, where one could probably see the sense of having a waterproof writing utensil around, there would probably be some sharpies handy on that too. This is actually where I figure he got it.</p>

<p>Also, at least judging by all the gas station bathroom &quot;art&quot; I see around where I live, quite a few people of his age group appear to have them at hand frequently as well.</p>

<p>I could think of lots of simple reasons how he would have had one handy, my main point is his ability to have a way to write or not is not exactly a solid piece of information to pin a conspiracy on.</p>

If this note was really there then went on earth didn&#39;t they say that in the 72 hours it took for him TO WRITE a confession to the FBI?  He couldn&#39;t talk so he wrote it on paper to the FBI, and now conveniently when people are really starting to question if he is innocent?  Doesn&#39;t bother anyone that this COULD HAVE BEEN YOU OR ME?   Why is nobody asking why the backpack doesn&#39;t match the picture they released?   What about the car jacked victim,  why has he not come out and identified himself?  He&#39;s the hero in the whole story (had he not have escaped. ... I mean released. . Anyone know how the official story reads now? ) who called the police and gave them information on what vehicle they drove in,  and there wereabouts that night,  oh and that they confessed to him they had killed the cop at MIT too, AND THEM THEY LET HIM GO?   These are RUTHLESS jihadists we&#39;re dealing with that couldn&#39;t wait to get to heaven and meet his brother in Paradise with virgins waiting.   </p>

<p>Had he really have been a radical jihadist who hated America, DO YOU REALLY THINK HE WOULD HIDE AND COWER IN A BOAT?   Remember you only get virgins and meet your bro IF YOU DIE!   Obviously he didn&#39;t want to die,  and he believed enough in America to give himself up after being shot at 30 plus times in the boat,  to have his day in court. Or so he thought. </p>

<p>And why is the MSM so willing to report this news (broken by a single CBS news reporter based on anonymous sources,  but they aren&#39;t even willing to question why there were Craft mercenaries at the finish line which there IS ACTUAL PROOF OF in pictures?   </p>

<p>All I know is if a terrorist who is on 2 watch lists,  one from FBO, one from CIA, is able to fly to Russia and receive terrorist training,  and build up a small Arsenal of guns,  grenades,  and bombs,  then how are gun laws going to keep us safer?</p>

I asked him today after I saw it all over the news and he thought it was weird too. I have tried looking for articles on it from weeks ago and I cannot find anything. I know he listens to a lot of talk radio and has a lot of friends in military/police so maybe he heard it from one of those sources. I will still try to find an older article.

<p>Also, the government involvement in previous attempted terrorist attacks (those that you read about &quot;FBI foils terror plot&quot; in reality the FBI is also involved in many of these, providing equipment and/or coercing people) as well as terrorist attacks that were allowed to happen on U.S. soil.</p>

<p>its been one month since the bombing</p>

<p>Gotta figure out your plurals man. Did he write the confession months ago or just one month ago? Bit of a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW...He was likely in the boat for HOURS before the shootout and before it got dark, so he would have had plenty of time to write his &quot;confession&quot;.  </p>

<p>The initial shootout with police and the two brothers happened in the early hours of Friday, April 19th.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/01/justice/boston-marathon-timeline">Source</a></p>

<p>Throughout that entire day, police searched the area.  It wasn&#39;t until around 6 PM Friday evening that the homeowner found Dzhokhar hiding in the boat.  He would have had ALL DAY to hide in that boat and write whatever note was allegedly found.  Even under a tarp, there would have been adequate light to see what he was doing.</p>

<p>With that said, I think the boat confession is bullshit.  It conveniently negates any legal issues with his pre-Miranda confession in the hospital.  I&#39;m only pointing out the timeline to argue against what some have said about it being too dark in the boat for him to see.  He&#39;d been in there nearly all day.</p>

<p>The only logical move now would be for Dzhokhar to die in the hospital.  This will finally tie up all the loose ends and the MSM can focus on the bravery and heroic spirit of the survivors.  Perhaps a few sound bites from amputees calling for more cameras on the streets or a greater police presence at large outdoor events.  </p>

<p>My guess is a blood clot from his massive injuries will travel to his brain, causing a stroke.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BULLSHIT!  First, we are to believe that he confessed by &quot;nodding his head&quot; (cause he couldn&#39;t speak), but he demanded a lawyer and stopped nodding after he was told his Miranda rights.</p>

<p>Now, weeks later, out of no where...they FIND his confession on the inside of the boat?  Nobody noticed it till now?  Did the FBI find it weeks ago but decided to sit on the information, or did they just find it now because they forgot to examine the crime scene?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Don&#39;t worry, before long they will change the story once again from &quot;he found a pen&quot; to &quot;he found a sharpie&quot;.  Hell, they might even say he found clipboard with his personalized stationary with his name clearly embossed on the header.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused by the part of the report that claims he referred, in writing, to his brother&#39;s death and predicted subsequent martyrdom. How the fuck would he have known at that point that his brother was dead? He saw him injured I presume, but reports say Tamerlan died in hospital (or on the way to hospital?) after failed attempts to treat him... explain? Either way, if the official story is to be believed, Dzhokhar would have been long gone from the scene at the time of his brother&#39;s death. Oh wait I forgot Islam automatically bestows its followers with the gift of pre-cognition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t he send a text message or try to call someone?  Maybe his phone battery died?  Maybe he figured he was being hunted and couldn&#39;t use the phone?</p>

<p>Best guess I have is that he was already in custody.  That&#39;s why he didn&#39;t phone anyone to take responsibility.   The whole boat thing was just for show - the manhunt had to make precedent using the military to search house to house.  And they cheered.  Boston, you pussies.</p>

<p>And what is the point of a terrorist act if the fucking terrorists aren&#39;t claiming responsibility?  I guess this is the reason for producing a &#39;note&#39;.. such bullshit.   I&#39;m ashamed at Americans that buy this crap.</p>
