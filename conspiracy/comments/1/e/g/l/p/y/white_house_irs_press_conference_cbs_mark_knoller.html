    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. I loathe modern conservatism. BUT-they stood firm in opposition of the attack on the second amendment, which is ultimately what our other freedoms come from. The whole system is inherently corrupt and needs to be torn down, but i don&#39;t see that happening without bloodshed. If the republicans were actually what they ostensibly claimed to be...proponents of small government, i&#39;d have supported them before corporations took over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you to a point. But, they stand firm on the 2nd amendment while creating a situation where we are really going to need those rights at what I consider to be a faster rate than the dems, maybe that is a good thing, let&#39;s bring it to crisis and get it over with. I don&#39;t know though, it is all so fucked up now it is hard to draw any clear straight lines anywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always talk about martial law around here like that is the end of everything. The trick, to my mind, is to have the majority of the army on the public&#39;s side so those guns get pointed in the right direction. Martial law could be the best thing in a scenario where the armed forces are prepared to turn on their keepers. Crazy talk, but it is late in the day and the coffee has cooked my brain, I&#39;m out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also need to take into account that the local police forces deal with the public on a daily basis. It is their job to police the local population. The military and the civilian worlds are pretty secluded from each other in terms of interaction. Unless you were in or have a family member in it could seem robotic when its really a jumbled mess. So naturally I would agree on the police taking more of a government sided stance because their job seems to place them on that side of the fence. But honestly I think it comes down to who values their job over their beliefs and ultimately they will side with who they think will come out on top. I&#39;d place lower enlisted in the military on public side and higher ranking with the govt just for those reasons. It would be one hell of an order asking a family man to turn his sights on his neighbor and many wouldn&#39;t do so</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I guess one of the reasons why he failed is because the Republicans have held congress since 2008 and been opposing everything he&#39;s been trying to do. Though everything can&#39;t be blamed on them, of course.</p>
