    <div class="md"><p>not simply for possessing them, but it you want to do any research or reap any profits from the use of patented genes, then yes you would have to pay royalties. Which is fucked up enough by itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So lets extrapolate a bit on that. Lets say I have a gene mutation that gives me certain symptoms that I want to get rid off. And a corporation has the patent to that specific mutation of genes. If I choose to treat my symptoms with a method that is not accepted or given or sold by that corporation, could I eventually end up in jail?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the method of your treatment involved metabolic manipulation at the sub-cellular level (i.e. genetic engineering), then they could order a cease and desist, since that would be considered experimentation on a gene whose patent they own. If you did not obey the cease and desist, they could seize any equipment and findings related to your experimentation, and yes they could put you in jail. </p>

<p>If the treatment were a more general treatment that was not demonstrably targeting the patented gene, then I doubt they could do much, but corporate lawyers are wonderful at manipulting the legal system, so maybe they&#39;d find a way if they really wanted to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So following on that thought, that would mean, for example: that if I would find a way to manipulate some genes in a more efficient way, less invasive maybe, better for the patient and maybe also the environment and a whole lot cheaper, they would have the authority to shut my investigation down because they own the patent. A patent where they might be getting a lot of money from. Would that be fair to say or assume?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. From my understanding, they could shut you down in those circumstances. It&#39;s situations like that which make people ridicule the runaway train of patent law. The core of patent law is that patents are supposed to support and promote innovation, yet it seems that the bulk ofthe time, they are now used to supress it for the sake of profits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true.  I understand your thinking, but the patent does not patent YOUR genes.  It patents copies of them.  I disagree with the law because I think it provides corporations with the chance to monopolize research and hamper scientific inquiry.  The law does not apply to genes in your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even a lawyer for one of the corporations and I can tell you that I can easily shoot that down. The Constitution is a contract. None of us signed it yet apparenty we&#39;re bound to it. Software licenses hold to all software, including the ones you own. Copyrighted music says that you must royalties even if you play songs with instruments you bought with your own money - or with instruments you built yourself. Intellectual property is a copyrighted thought. They can and will do anythng they want</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This astonishing revelation has emerged from the fact that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office claims the power to assign ownership of your DNA to private companies and universities who apply for patents on your genes.</p>

<p>It must be going to be pushed along the lines of &quot;what can be assigned can be unassigned.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone who believes in Democracy more than Republicanism or in conscription etc is already doing the same thing anyway.   </p>
