They can throw Obama under the bus now because he is in his second term, but they cannot have Hillary being publicly shamed.  </p>

<p>Notice the news didn&#39;t bring up the Benghazi hearings, they came at us with that murder verdict and those women being &quot;found&quot; in that guys house, then when that wasn&#39;t distracting the right wingers, they pulled these IRS and phone tapping scandals.  It&#39;s like a blinking light that pulls the attention away from something they don&#39;t want us discussing.</p>

The CIA and heavy weapons were involved, but the only narrative we have is that it was just simply a terrorist attack.  What was the motive of the rebels?  What about the CIA outpost that was also hit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhh.. I&#39;ve seen Benghazi on the news and heard it on the radio several times, including last night. There may be a sampling bias here. </p>

<p>I always find it funny that people with a strong distrust for the media, are the first to blame the media for not covering something they want it to. Not only that, but they claim to not watch the &quot;MSM&quot; and then complain about it not covering something. Well if you don&#39;t watch it, how do you know they aren&#39;t covering it? Of course YOU haven&#39;t seen any coverage because you haven&#39;t been WATCHING.</p>

<p>The illegal seizure of the Associated Press phone records is a potentially much larger scandal in that it has really pissed off people on both the right and the left. Somebody leaked that this- but who?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about it being a detriment to the &quot;future of the species&quot;?  The species will still be here, it will just be enslaved, more so than now.

It&#39;s part of something called &quot;the open conspiracy&quot; they make their intentions very clear if you know how to see through the flowery rhetoric. It&#39;s part of a very old plan that is coming to a head.  Sorry, but you&#39;ve obviously never studied this stuff.  Here&#39;s a little &quot;fragment&quot; for you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SECTION I. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS: Chapter 2.1. In order to meet the challenges of environment and development, States have decided to <strong>establish a new global partnership.</strong> This partnership <strong>commits all States to engage in a continuous and constructive dialogue</strong>, inspired by the need <strong>to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy</strong>, keeping in view the increasing <strong>interdependence of the community of nations</strong> and that sustainable development should become a priority item on the agenda of the international community. It is recognized that, for the success of this new partnership, <strong>it is important to overcome confrontation and to foster a climate of genuine cooperation and solidarity</strong>. It is equally important to strengthen national and international policies and multinational cooperation to <strong>adapt to the new realities.</strong></p>

<p>There are more, but you should know since you&#39;ve studied it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still confused as to how can you interpret anything in Agenda 21 as pushing an agenda that &quot;set[s] the stage for world government under an unelected, undemocratic, private technocratic organization run by the big banks and robber baron families.&quot; </p>

<p>On land management, they have NGOs come into town and make &quot;sustainable development&quot; plans that are uniform throughout the planet, they make it seem like they are getting public input but they railroad past any opposition to the new regulations.</p>

<p>On Agriculture, this is a power grab on the part of big agra who is buying up land constantly(I live in Iowa, I know this shit)</p>

<p>On combating deforestation... this is just a random entry you&#39;ve chosen to highlight the words &quot;decentralization of decision making&quot;.</p>

<p>I hate explaining this to people who won&#39;t get it anyway but here it goes.</p>

<p>The robber baron families and big banks SET UP THE UN.  They are standardizing the world&#39;s infrastructure and laws in order to bring about standardized world government.  They will use the guise of environmentalism to control every aspect of your life from your water intake to your power consumption to what kind of car you can drive.  Eventually once the big carbon tax schemes get in place everyone will technically be enslaved, more so than now.  They push this &quot;equity&quot; meme to get the poor and &quot;liberal&quot; types on their side.  They have an army of NGOs and non-profits that are working to change culture as well as infiltrate local governments, as stated above in your &quot;combating poverty&quot; excerpt, the NGOs will be working hand in hand with local governments.  The NGOs are more or less the henchmen for the UN.  The robber baron families fund the NGOs, which create the non-profit advocacy groups that form fake &quot;grassroots&quot; movements in local areas in order to create the illusion of public support for the standardization of policy.  It&#39;s a genius plan, they&#39;ve got you fooled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I understand that the text is vague, and I am open to discussion the interpretation and implementation of A21, but you can&#39;t just make stuff up. For instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Combating poverty, tell me where that isn&#39;t redistribution of wealth using NGOs? Communism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to be racist, but that&#39;s such a stereotypically American things to say. Besides, it doesn&#39;t mention communism at all. In fact, it doesn&#39;t even mention redistribution of wealth. What it does talk about is empowering the local population and giving them more control over their own resources. In 3.7 &quot;Giving communities a large measure of participation in the sustainable management and protection of the local natural resources in order to enhance their productive capacity;&quot; or &quot;Establish new community-based mechanisms and strengthen existing mechanisms to enable communities to gain sustained access to resources needed by the poor to overcome their poverty;&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not trying to cherry-pick, but A21 <em>stresses</em> local and municipal control in many areas. It directly contradicts the globalist agenda. It continually emphasizes the need for a &#39;bottom-up&quot; approach to most situations. Chapter 23: &quot;23.2. One of the fundamental prerequisites for the achievement of sustainable development is broad public participation in decision-making. Furthermore, in the more specific context of environment and development, the need for new forms of participation has emerged. This includes the need of individuals, groups and organizations to participate in environmental impact assessment procedures and to know about and participate in decisions, particularly those which potentially affect the communities in which they live and work.&quot;</p>

<p>You should look into Agenda 21 in Sweden, but you probably have since you&#39;ve studied this. While I wouldn&#39;t judge it has a huge success by any means, there has been improvement in many of the areas targeted, including in the energy sector and public participation in governmental affairs. But nothing to indicate any <em>increased</em> centralization of power.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Reading comprehension isn&#39;t your strong point I guess.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t respond to your long-winded paragraph, it&#39;s full of unsourced claims that I&#39;m not sure either of us want to get into.
 But, as I mentioned originally, I&#39;m interested in the text of Agenda 21 itself and whatever implementation that is the direct result of the agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The globalist agenda <em>IS</em> bottom-up that&#39;s the point.  They are infiltrating local governments in the &quot;approved&quot; cities.  The small towns are dying off and the young people are moving into the cities, in Iowa(where I am) this is very obvious. T</p>

<p>Agenda 21 has been updated several times, this includes the millennium development goals and every &quot;+&quot; meeting they&#39;ve had, for instance Rio+20.  </p>

<p>All of the excerpts you are citing are worded in a way that the people who are taking part in implementing it know what to do and that the people who are observing from the outside have a vague idea of what it <em>might</em> mean.  They bribe city councils with grants via the big foundations, then have the non-profits come in and cause a stir, then the NGOs arrive with the solutions to the &quot;grassroots&quot; movements&#39; issues.  I cannot stress this enough, it is being implemented by stealth, dishonestly.  If you&#39;re in Sweden then you&#39;ve already had the socialist propaganda shoved down your throat your entire life so all of this seems normal to you.  Here in the US, taxes are looked at as a bad thing, they literally enslave you to a system, so the less the better.  Agenda 21 initiatives increase taxes, property taxes, electric bills, food prices, etc.  How is that good for the poor? It&#39;s like this contradiction slips by people.  So we make people poorer, to somehow help the poor?  Makes total sense.  All while &quot;saving&quot; the environment from those pesky humans.  </p>

<p>Agenda 21 won&#39;t mention communism, it won&#39;t mention socialism, it won&#39;t mention fascism, because it doesn&#39;t want to blatantly spell out the goals, it makes it much easier to get people to go with it.  I mean shit, look at WHO put it together, people like Maurice Strong who is a Rothschild front man.  At the UNCED conference in Denver he was very adamant about kissing Rothschild ass, you should definitely look into that, there&#39;s the speech out there somewhere on the web.</p>

<p>At what point does the globalist agenda come into play? As in at what point in the hierarchy does the &quot;real&quot; interpretation come into play and how many people know about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The standardization of laws, policies, schools, cultural norms, consumption patterns, infrastructure, taxes, etc, make bringing in a world government so much easier.  Let me put it this way, you slowly transition everyone into a standard way of life, especially at a local level making it seem less centralized, so that when the time comes to transition from nation-states into world government people notice no difference.  They&#39;re normalizing poverty lifestyles, hence the &quot;walkable&quot; cities and emphasis on public transit, the small cramped living environments, the focus on eating &quot;local&quot; food meaning you&#39;re not getting those oranges from Florida, or those Kiwis from NZ or wherever. </p>

<p>My city is a perfect example, we had some guys from the &quot;Walkable and Livable Communities Inc&quot; come here and push their &quot;smart growth&quot; ideas, they want to tear up major roads and put walking paths in, to &quot;encourage people to walk&quot; instead of drive.  Yes great idea, except we live in Iowa and have some of the harshest winters in the country.   Here is a quote from <a href="http://wcfcourier.com/bluezones/articles/blue-zones-experts-visit-cedar-valley-looking-for-ways-to/article_46c61f76-1e54-5d6a-9a5a-e0fd6ddb4ed0.html">this article:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If we try to figure out where <em>this next economy takes us</em>, it&#39;s going to go <em>right back to the human foot,</em> to people <em>being active again</em> where people <em>know more neighbors</em>,&quot; he said. &quot;Large cities in time will turn around, but it&#39;s going to be the smaller towns that have the ability to <em>change more quickly</em> because people <em>work together</em>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay so he is referring to some &quot;next economy&quot; meaning what?  For some reason we will all be walking everywhere, being &quot;active&quot;, &quot;knowing&quot; &quot;more&quot; &quot;neighbors&quot; aka having more people crammed in around you.  Large cities are already sprawling so it will take a long time to consolidate them, but the &quot;small towns&quot; can &quot;change more quickly&quot; because for some reason we &quot;work together&quot;?  So he is pushing communitarianism basically, a nice way of saying socialism, collectivism.  This Blue Zones Project that he is a part of, is the local &quot;grassroots&quot; advocacy group(that didn&#39;t start here btw), funded by the NGO Wellmark, which is funded by the big corporation Blue Cross/Blue Shield among others.  This is the perfect Agenda 21 scenario.  They do it under the guise of &quot;making things better&quot;, but really they are out to change everyone&#39;s way of life to their standard.  To get people ready for poverty, all under the guise of &quot;healthy living&quot;.  Like they give a fuck.</p>

<p>The authoritarians have learned from the past, they need to condition people to changes as opposed to forcing it upon them.  You should read about social engineering and how that works.  Huxleys talked about it, so did Bertrand Russell.  The big think tanks all had super genius sociologists working for them and helped to lay out this plan.  It is a Fabian Socialist plan, the UN was created by the Royal Institute for International Affairs/Council on Foreign Relations and those groups were started by the Fabian Socialists.  <a href="http://seeker401.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/cs_may05b.jpg">Their emblem being a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.</a></p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/?nid=2665">Here is a speech made by Ban Ki Moon the UN secretary General at the Royal Institute for International Affairs, he acknowledges they shape policy</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMXOMTGov5o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMXOMTGov5o</a>  remember what I said about standardization of laws? at the 1:52 mark, notice what she is saying.....</p>
