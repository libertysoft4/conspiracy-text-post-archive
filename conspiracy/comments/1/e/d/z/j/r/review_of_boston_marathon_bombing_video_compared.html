        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was reviewing the video clips of the runners crossing the finish line at Boston Marathon,  and found a website (link below) that you can search the runners BIB number pinned to their chests and see the actual time or official time they finished. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% clear on how their official times are calculated (first wave,  second wave,  etc) but from what I can tell Boston Marathon doesn&#39;t start the runners clock until they actually cross the start line. </p>

<p>Below are pictures of the runners I could identify from the Boston Globe video here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=046MuD1pYJg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=046MuD1pYJg</a></p>

<p>Link to search BIB numbers:
raceday.baa.org/searchable-results.html</p>

<p>What I found may be completely explainable, (which if is the case I would love some opinions) but just doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>Please see the following runners times as ordered in the way they crossed the finish line on the Boston Globe video with a screen shot of their matching BIB number lookups:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/As4pNhw.png">http://imgur.com/As4pNhw.png</a>  (Man Who fell down, identified as Bill Iffrig in interviews,  no BIB number can be found,  used look up of name instead)</p>

<p>Two points I&#39;d like to make here.  The woman in the green shirt is seen throwing something at the time of the first explosion,  which is then caught by Mr. Iffrig, is identified as Iris Y Chen in the official marathon records,  and her time is shown as 3:39:36, when the first explosion didn&#39;t happen until 4:09:ish. </p>

<p>Clearly this is not Iris Chen who had this BIB number registered to her.   Iris Chen is quoted in the link below stating she was back in the &quot;hotel gym shower&quot; an hour later when she was told what happened; 
<a href="http://www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/maniacs/MyMarathons.asp?ManiacId=731">www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/maniacs/MyMarathons.asp?ManiacId=731</a></p>

<p>Ironically [or maybe not] Iris Chen from New York, NY happens to be the CEO of I have Dream foundation.   Not sure if it is the same Iris Chen that ran the marathon. </p>

<p>Lastly Bill Iffrig was interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on ABC about his fall.   In that interview there&#39;s a white female named Rebecca Roche who is also interviewed.   She agreed when  Stephanopoulos lead her info saying &quot;You had finished just before Bill&quot; when she then elaborates and says she was .30 seconds in front of Iffrig.  Well searching the baa site sure finished with a time of 3:59, almost 10 minutes before.<br/>
She wore green in the interview,  and until now I had assumed it was the same girl in green that dropped something in front of Iffrig.</p>

<p>I could be totally wrong about everything that I just posted,  please if I&#39;m missing something in regards to how runners times are kept,  please correct me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this information,  I think you are absolutely correct that the woman in green is actually 18430, who had a finish time of 4:05:32.  This makes more sense,  but still doesn&#39;t explain why the other runners in this picture finished (most of them)  3 minutes later@ 4:08. Maybe it&#39;s human error and nothing else.   Alsothere are some more puzzling times that I have come across.   Will post more shortly. </p>

<p>I believe the woman in green actually has the number &quot;18430&quot;. It would be interesting to see what your method comes out with then.</p>

<p>Regardless of the outcome (I think it&#39;s gonna work out as expected when that number is used) I really love this kinda stuff and want to thank you for tingling my mind :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wouldnt it be safe to asume you have the wrong nuber as it isnt clearly visble on the video. also all the other runner times seam to match up correctly. As we can clearly see in the video a woman in green crossing the line around 4:08 inline with the runners who where near her at the time either: </p>

<ul>
<li>the result is wrong computer error / human input error due to the confusion<br/></li>
<li>The number on her shirt that you cannot clearly see as the last digit is not visible is wrong</li>
<li>she swaped shirts with someone</li>
<li>she or someone else completed the race and she borrowed the number </li>
</ul>

<p>Her number needs to be varified</p>

<p>also Chen sounds like a chinese name </p>

<p>also in the video there is a bomb that goes of a short time after the first one why would someone run past the first device to detonate the one near the finish line first? </p>

<p>I just dont know why you would want to run past a bomb to detonate it when there are many more ways it could be done also to do this on camera seams a bit odd and taking unessecary risks. - (the plain site explanation is speculation)</p>

<p>PLus the amount of whitnesses + the fact that if it was actors they were able to turn a normal lookign scene into one that looks like the after math of a bombing in seconds in front of whitnesses and cameras live. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think they all start at the same time with the huge crowd sorted on competence like faster and pro runners at the front and so forth. Don&#39;t think they are individually timed when coming across the start line so I think they all have the same start time. EDIT: Just realized I missed the line where you say they probably time it when each individual goes over the line. So I don&#39;t know and I&#39;ll retract my speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big marathons have such huge numbers taking part that runners at the back don&#39;t cross start line for ages (up to half an hour!) after the gun goes off. For this reason, a runners&#39; official time starts when their chip is activated crossing the start line. </p>

<p>It could therefore be possible for someone to get personal time of 3.39 when the main timer at the finish line said 4.09.</p>

<p>Edit: I should add, I also think the woman in green&#39;s number is probably 18430 rather than 16430.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me you argument is based on the fact that you don&#39;t understand how chip timing works. Official times are based on when the runner crosses the start line, not when the gun goes off. The clock at the finish line is the gun time. You are going to see differences between a runner&#39;s official finish time and the finish line clock.</p>
