        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s a good idea for us all to watch closely what&#39;s happening in Turkey right now.  There are massive protests in Istanbul and Ankara.  What started as a protest to block the paving over of a park to build a mall in the middle of Istanbul has escalated to become a protest against the fascist policies of the current leadership.  The media blackout by MSM in US and Turkey should not come as a surprise, however we may want to consider the reason.  </p>

<p>In short:  Syria</p>

<p>We have been preparing for military intervention in Syria for months.  Now the the media is reporting that Assad is using chemical weapons, and they&#39;re portraying the rebels as &quot;freedom fighters&quot; even though they are largely the same violent factions that are presently tearing apart Egypt.  John McCain just visited with Syrian rebels in the last few weeks.  I have no doubts that US leaders are ready to go in and help overthrow Assad.</p>

<p>This is where the importance of Turkey comes in.  They are the primary ally for the US in the region, and they border Syria.  They have been cooperating with CIA to usher in foreign fighters, weapons, and supplies to fuel the fight against Assad.  If the Turkish government falls, it will be a setback to the agenda of military intervention in Syria.  </p>

<p>Anyone who thinks this is a good thing should support the protests in Turkey.  I have several close friends from Turkey and they are asking for as much help as possible in getting the message out to put interntational pressure on the Turkish government to stop the brutal assault on protestors.  If you&#39;d like to help, you can share this message with your friends via social media, or you can do what many of us have done and email the Turkish ambassador to the US (or wherever you&#39;re from) and the US ambassador to Turkey urging them to get involved.  Sample email in the comments.  </p>

<p>Yes you are absolutely right, this is the key point. A destabalised Turkey is good for Assad and bad for the terrorists aswell as the criminal western governments supporting them. </p>

<p>If there is a grand plan to force regime change in multiple countries as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">General Wesley Clark</a> suggests this situation in Turkey could really hinder both their long and short-term agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if there&#39;s inner turmoil in Turkey it makes it more difficult for them to send arms and get fighters into Syria. The government will have bigger issues to deal with and Syria won&#39;t be a priority, it also takes Syria off the headlines.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s unlikely but if the government actually fell in Turkey the new one could treat the Syria conflict in a totally different way. They may be apposed to funding the rebels and prevent them using their border to get into Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timing is quite interesting.  I&#39;m wondering;</p>

<ul>
<li>How much the Turkish people know about their governments involvement in Syria</li>
<li>How much Russian agents had to do with getting this movement off the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>At any rate it seems like it is all coming down to Syria at this point.  The Russians just announced that they are sending their only aircraft carrier to the Med at the same moment as this massive Turkey event.  Is this an example of Russian badassery?  There seems to be some great synchronicity with these two events.  At this exact moment I&#39;d bet more chips on a superior Russian strategy mostly because they haven&#39;t been shooting their load off constantly and they seem to be picking their battles and strategically retreating and don&#39;t seem to have such a complicated and convoluted agenda like the West.  I&#39;m of the opinion that the Cypruss money grab has a hell of a lot to do with Russian money and market access and that it is tightly related to this conflict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Send an email to the Turkish Ambassador to the US urging him to leverage his influence by putting pressure on the local authorities in Istanbul to end the brutal treatment of protestors. His name is Namık Tan. Email: <a href="mailto:ambassador@turkishembassy.org">ambassador@turkishembassy.org</a>. (Someone reported that this email was not working-perhaps it is down from being blown up over the last 24 hrs- here is an alternative if it doesn&#39;t work: <a href="mailto:embassy.washingtondc@mfa.gov.tr">embassy.washingtondc@mfa.gov.tr</a>) I have an email drafted already. Feel free to edit or update but is a good start.</p>

<p>Mr. Ambassador,</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing to express my disappointment at how the protests in Istanbul have been handled by the authorities there, and to request that you and your colleagues leverage the full weight of your influence to stop the brutal treatment of protestors in Taksim Square.</p>

<p>There are blatant human rights violations taking place that are in no way justifiable. I implore you to help remind the leaders in your country that the protestors are their fellow countrymen, and deserve at the very least the same human rights guaranteed by various international agreements and established doctrines within Turkey.</p>

<p>At least one person is confirmed to have been killed with countless others injured from fires, tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons. The injured are being denied basic help and healthcare. This is barbaric and should not be tolerated in a developed nation such as yours.</p>

<p>I trust that you will act accordingly and will step in to use your influence to bring and end to the carnage in a sane and just way. The people have spoken. It is your duty as an official within the Turkish government to listen to them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>The worse they treat the people the more will come out and the more likely the government will fall, it was originally a pretty inconsequential protest that blew up because of police brutality. </p>

<p>A part of me hopes the fuckers keep it up thus exposing their despotic tendencies and hypocritical stance on Assad, it might actually spur some fundamental change in Turkey. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I was thinking about making this post. </p>

<p>What&#39;s also important is that one of the main reasons the protest are happening is because Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwani) Erdogan has been supporting terrorist Ikhwanis inside Syria. The secularists of Turkey and Syria are friends with each other and they all hate the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen (Muslim Brotherhood).</p>

<p>The Muslim Brotherhood of course is the network which created the Libyan uprising, the Egyptian uprising, the Afghan uprising (in the 80s), and the Syrian uprising. </p>

<p>In short the Muslim Brotherhood is on the payroll of the empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t speak Hebrew, but I gave it a try with Google Translate. It&#39;s a pretty standard map, except for the fact that their language is more descriptive and &quot;mythical&quot;. The top text reads something like &quot;the conduct of tribal boundaries&quot;. The text between the Euphrates &amp; Tigris rivers (current Iraq) reads &quot;Land of Adam&quot;. The bent text on Greater Israel reads: &quot;The land Israel would serve&quot;. The text in Saudi-Arabia reads &quot;burning desert&quot;. It&#39;s a very difficult language, many symbols look awfully similar and can mess up translating easily. Not to mention that reading is from right to left. </p>

<p>If anyone is able to properly translate the full columns of text, that would be of more use I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timing is quite interesting.  I&#39;m wondering;</p>

<ul>
<li>How much the Turkish people know about their governments involvement in Syria</li>
<li>How much Russian agents had to do with getting this movement off the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>At any rate it seems like it is all coming down to Syria at this point.  The Russians just announced that they are sending their only aircraft carrier to the Med at the same moment as this massive Turkey event.  Is this an example of Russian badassery?  There seems to be some great synchronicity with these two events.  At this exact moment I&#39;d bet more chips on a superior Russian strategy mostly because they haven&#39;t been shooting their load off constantly and they seem to be picking their battles and strategically retreating and don&#39;t seem to have such a complicated and convoluted agenda like the West.  I&#39;m of the opinion that the Cypruss money grab has a hell of a lot to do with Russian money and market access and that it is tightly related to this conflict.</p>
