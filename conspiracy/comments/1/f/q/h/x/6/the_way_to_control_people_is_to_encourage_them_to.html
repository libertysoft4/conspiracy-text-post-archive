        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Humans have an instinctive need for power. In industrialized societies however, most power of humans is taken away, and retained by corporations, governments and regulations, because industrial societies can only function efficiently when humans have no power.</p>

<p>This leads to feelings of frustration, anger and inadequacy in humans. The way society attempts to solve this crisis is by giving humans a <em>simulated experience of acquiring power</em>. For some humans this simulated experience leads to satisfaction in life, but many others are left feeling empty, because the power they are told they have seized turns out to be an illusion.</p>

<p>There are many simulated forms of power acquisition. A popular one for the dumb masses is sports. The masses are encouraged to get riled up about idiots running after a ball, a simulated form of warfare. Commentators, misinterpreted by the human brain as &quot;war veterans&quot;, often gather around on TV and discuss the sports match as if it were an important event with real life repercussions in our own lives. Also popular for young males are video games, in which they can generally play either an adventurer, a soldier, or a warlord.</p>

<p>Democracy however is a form of power simulation that is even more effective at pacifying the masses. Under democracy, people are led to believe that they can acquire power by voicing their opinion, or by &quot;voting&quot;. They are preferentially encouraged to get angry over issues that have no genuine impact on the functioning of their society, such as gay marriage or apparently &quot;wasteful&quot; government expenses. The masses divide up into teams, and gain a sense of satisfaction from being on the winning side. Ideal are issues where the opponents of change are old, while the proponents are young, as it allows people to feel a long term sense of control over their lives. &quot;I wanted gays to get married, I considered this highly important to me, and my wish was fulfilled.&quot;</p>

<p>The problem however, is that people do not feel a sense of satisfaction from these issues, as the power is found to be an illusion. People may see their political candidate, or their sports team, or their reality show character win, but in the end of the day they still live in concrete apartment blocks, for which they pay rent with a humiliating job that swallows up most of their life. The real source of frustration, anger and inadequacy is the sense of being subject to the authority of others and having no power over the fundamental elements of their existence.</p>

<p>This is the inevitable result of technological progress. Under conditions of lower population density, and less communication and transportation technology, people living in tribal groups can control their direct territory, and maintain a sense of autonomy. Instead of working for a salary, tribal people survive by producing their own food, and instead of being dependent on government authority people are required to defend themselves, thereby allowing them to feel in control of their own day to day existence, and as a result adequate and powerful. A man carrying a stick is a force to be reckoned with under such conditions.</p>

<p>In comparison, even when gays are finally allowed to juggle with chainsaws on Times Square, Western people will still feel a sense of frustration, anger and inadequacy, because it has no genuine influence on their own day to day existence. The only hope for civilized people is to work towards the collapse of industrial civilization, as this will redistribute power from organizations into the hands of human beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. When a corporation does something bad (let&#39;s say the BP oil spill), someone in that company is responsible for the decisions made that led to the outcome. So, someone, somewhere <em>is</em> responsible for actions within the company. By allowing corporations to be people, you take away the ability to make someone personally responsible and that means no punishment. People these days get fines and that in contrast to profits over a quarter or per annum is a joke.</p>

<p>That is true of <em>any</em> non-primitive society, industrial or not. In fact many of the mechanisms that you described (for instance distracting the masses with useless, meaningless stuff like sports) where conceived/described thousands of years ago. Check for instance the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses">panem et circensis</a> of the ancient Romans.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/august/greed-middle-ages-080212.html">The difference is that humans in agricultural societies <em>do</em> have power.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In another, more dramatic, example of the community rejection of selfish business practices, murder was seen as the only response severe enough to deal with a pompous businessman, Uly Mörnach. He was a property owner who insisted he had the power and the right to do what he wanted with his property. As Stokes found by sifting through the archives of the city of Basel, &quot;He insisted on a kind of individualistic … perspective on his own life.&quot;</p>

<p>Although his impressive property holdings might be admired in today&#39;s culture, he was seen as downright despicable by his medieval peers for the way he threw his financial weight around. In one instance, Stokes found, he beat an old woman when he discovered her taking water from his meadow. When the woman pressed charges, Mörnach lied about the matter in court, and laughed about it later to his friends.</p>

<p>In medieval society, his disregard for the rules of social responsibility and the value of community honor was a misstep that disturbed his neighbors deeply, so much so that they collectively conspired to murder him – with many of them escaping legal repercussions.</p>

<p>In today&#39;s society, with face scanning cameras and DNA databases, all power is retained by government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see the logic in this. Even in your tribal scenario, people are still forced to hunt, gather, and craft to continue their existence, and these things take significantly more time and effort than an average job. They are also even more subject to forces far out of their control, be they diseases, natural disasters or famine and drought, and those could be (and are) easily personified and supplicated, to little or no effect.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t see how this restricted to society at all. If anytying, it&#39;s part of the human condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel I understand your concerns and agitation with the current status quo.  You&#39;re not alone.</p>

<p>You might want to read up on Karl Marx (the boogie man of the USA and for a good reason).  From my understanding he states capitalism leads to an inevitable struggle between the two classes (he calls them bourgeois and proletariat, some call them 1% and 99%, some call it rich and poor, some call it working class and job creators).  The trick is for the capitalists to obfuscate that struggle and divert attention to symptoms as if they are the actual cause of the problem (racism, sexism, banks, education, wars, drugs, laws, religion, whatever they can use to distract from class warfare and capitalism as a problem).  I would call most of these symptoms of capitalism. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only just started learning of alternate methods (feudalism, communism, socialism) but I know enough to understand that I&#39;m not happy with how capitalism treats me, my friends, my neighbors, my environment, or the world at large.  I suggest looking into new ways of doing things here in this country.  Richard Wolff is one who&#39;s got a good grasp on things and some alternative solutions as well.  Check him out if you&#39;re interested.  It&#39;s at least worth a few minutes of your time to see alternative stances.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm">Industrial Society and its Future by FC</a>?  </p>

<p>Much of what you describe sounds similar to the &quot;Power Process&quot; in the aforementioned manifesto.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE POWER PROCESS</p>

<p>33- Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the “power process.” This is closely related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later (paragraphs 42-44).</p>

<p>34- Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one’s power.</p>

<p>35- Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.</p>

<p>36- Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.</p>

<p>37- Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.</p>
