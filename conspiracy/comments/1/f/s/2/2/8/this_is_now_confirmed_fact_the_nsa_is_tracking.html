        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1)  We&#39;ve known this for some time, but the <strong>NSA is collecting data on your phone calls, texts, and what&#39;s called &quot;metadata,&quot;</strong>  or extra information about every connection your phone makes.    </p>

<p>2) There is some debate about what this metadata means.  However, the information has been out for some time.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv7Y0W0xmYQ">Here is a simple TED talk</a> explaining what that metadata can do. <strong>Metadata allows the government to track your location with every phone call, text, or internet connection. With pinpoint accuracy.</strong></p>

<p>3) This is going to hit mainstream media in a lackluster way.  Perhaps it will gain some traction, but the information discussed likely won&#39;t be complete or compelling.  We need to get this TED talk out there.  <strong>We need to make people aware</strong> of the extent of this program in order to bring about a public debate. The conversation can shift if we push in a logical, persistant manner.     </p>

<p>4) I know conspiracy is usually used to discuss information that is borderline.  But let&#39;s face it: borderline information is now no longer borderline.  The time for talking in the shadows is over.  Huge issues are now hitting public eyes, and <strong>now it is a fight between apathy and awareness.</strong>   </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv7Y0W0xmYQ">GET THIS TED TALK OUT TO EVERYONE</a>  The MSM will likely say that the NSA has &quot;metadata&quot; without explaining what that means.  Watch this talk.  Understand it.  Let&#39;s not let apathetic people control this narrative. When you see posts on this issue and people are unsure of what it means, get them this video.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>UPDATE: YOU&#39;RE BEING LIED TO BY THE MEDIA</strong>:  Now <a href="http://us.cnn.com/2013/06/06/politics/nsa-verizon-records/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">CNN is reporting this</a>, but as I predicted, they are defining metadata according to what the White House told them.  From the article:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call.&quot;    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note: These words now being repeated verbatim on all big news stories about this.  Metadata such as length of call and telephone number.  Over and over. Keep in mind: That is intentionally deceitful.</em>  </p>

<p>It&#39;s bullshit by omission.  They also know where you were standing, whether you were moving, and so on.  Want proof?  Watch the TED talk.  Also they likely have the content of the calls even though they are currently denying this.  Not only that but they are claiming its only for one network, and for a specified space of time.     </p>

<p>My guess is that this leak was orchestrated to calm the waters since it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/30/james-comey-fbi-bush-nsa">came out accidentally and Glen Greenwald jumped all over it</a>.  The strategy is to release a file that shows partial tapping on one network to make it look like a pilot program, whereas it&#39;s already much deeper and in effect for everyone.  That&#39;s my hunch.    </p>

<p>Again, <em>in my opinion</em>: Two lies are currently being told:   </p>

<p>1) Metadata is referring to phone number and length of call.  That&#39;s a lie.  Watch the TED talk.<br/>
2) This is a limited plan and it is temporary.   That&#39;s almost certainly a lie.  </p>

<p>Anyone that spends a significant amount of time here in r/conspiracy knows that <em>everytime</em> an agency has asked for records, the telecoms have provided. Those records have been used in court cases for years now. MSM just didnt want to pay attention to that because of the criminal prosecution surrounding every incident of civil infringement. But <em>NOW</em>? Now that its a blanket snooping on everyone, watch them carry it. (Because now its their civil liberties too)</p>

<p>It&#39;s so funny when you compare Bush with Obama. Everyone made fun of Bush for sucking at speeches, so this time we got a Teleprompter President in Obama. But this guy, even <em>with</em> his writers/scripts has made so many gaffes, its nuts how the media and talk-show hosts never make fun of him!</p>

<p>Obama: &quot;Reject the voices warning of tyranny&quot; (...few weeks later: IRS targeted conservatives; DOJ targeted journalists, NSA confiscated cellphone records). LOL WTF?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m sure this had been going on for a while. i KNOW it&#39;s been going on for internet data. back around the year 2000 i was sysadmin for a regional ISP in the south east. we were PAID very well to put a &quot;black box&quot; between our router and switches that collected data on where our customers went online. we raised all sorts of hell about privacy issues, but management didn&#39;t listen. whoever this was paid them WAY too much to give it up because of what WE said. we did not have access to this box, and ITS traffic back to its handlers was encrypted. they said it was collecting data for &quot;marketing research&quot;, but upper management never would tell US who paid for it and where the data is going. we tracked it all the way back to a Quest hub in VA, and lost it. we were upset because it effectively cut our bandwidth by a third (it was forwarding a LOT of packets back to its handlers to that quest hub somewhere around DC), and we bitched so much that whoever it was who installed it paid for us to have another T3 feed installed to make up for it. this equipment was still installed when i left in 2004.</p>

<p>the US data infrastructure is crippled by shit like this. EVERYTHING is routed through NSA data centers where packet level inspection is done on all traffic. this is why consumer internet is orders of magnitude slower in the US than in other modern countries.</p>

FBI agent goes to a completely innocent individuals domicile. &quot;someone told me there are drugs in this house &amp; I&#39;m going to search it&quot; said FBI guy. &quot;no problem! I have nothing to hide!

Now, each preceding day would be followed by a new agency (CIA, NSA, DHS...) coming with the same claims &amp; doing the same search, how many days do you think the &#39;I have nothing to hide!&#39; guy would last until he totally changes his mind about the issue? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I agree with you.  9/11 for me was always more of a rhetorical device.  It wasn&#39;t about the &quot;truth&quot; of the situation because in all honestly that was always out of reach.  The point was to reorient people to a stance where they weren&#39;t completely trusting everything in the MSM.  There was sufficient proof that the government was expanding rapidly out of control, but a specific story is easier to communicate that a broad, nebulous sense of &quot;things are changing for the worse, and fast.&quot; </p>

<p>9/11 was a compelling enough story to capture people&#39;s attention, whereas unprovable allegations about NSA were harder to rally around.  Now that this is happening, I absolutely agree there&#39;s enough out in the open to get people talking without resorting to false flags as a way to &quot;wake people up&quot; (to use the conspiracy language).   </p>

<p>I hope hope hope that people really get pissed about this one.  Also believe me this program is much larger and deeper than this leak suggests.  This goes very deep.  I predict it will eventually be revealed that in 2013 the government is recording all phone calls, emails and texts and tying that data to location and other personal data, probably also facial recognition.   </p>

<p>For the time being, that sort of talk will stay in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but what&#39;s already been <em>proven</em>, as you said, is hopefully enough to get people oriented in the right direction so that we as a society can start digging.</p>

<p>This is really true.  however if you look at it, we&#39;re still in the nascent stages of communicating with each other freely.  9/11 was one of the first massive events to happen in the internet era.  We saw the result.  I suspect that as time goes by and the traditional media continues to lose its following and revenue streams, more &quot;middle road&quot; commentators will spring up to fill the void that we are both commenting on.  Already people like Glen Greenwald and Dan Carlin are getting huge success in this space, and I predict their number will grow exponentially in the coming years, probably coagulating at some point into a few successful outlets.   </p>

<p>DemocracyNow! is too dry, but it is another example of an early attempt at this sort of work.   </p>

<p>The fact is that the gap between reality and what gets discussed is just too large now.  Anyone willing to jump into that gap can make money.  Therefore it will happen.  First by the people like Alex Jones, but increasingly by legit reporters, perhaps some of those who were laid off from the old media giants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is because authority has always relied on control of information.  Now with the internet, we can communicate in real time and with a variety of media, the only method for them to continue to assert authority is to use this same technology to monitor our every move.  Either that or they&#39;ll lose their grip, because we can easily expose what they do.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s basically an information arms race between the people and the government.  The arms race is initiated by the government because the people are by and large interested in pursuing their own happiness. What&#39;s resulted is that the contract between people and government (in the US this is the BIll of rights and Constitution) has been severely broken.</p>

<p>Special forces have been using a wireless technology called WiMoS for some time.</p>

<p>They can, by locating three wireless antennas, detect and map all motion within a 1km<sup>2</sup> area.</p>

<p>Combine a widespread network of these, with active &quot;meta-data&quot; from the NSA and you have a complete, real-time map of everyone in a wide area. Using WiMoS you have moving objects, and with NSA&#39;s meta-data you can map those moving objects to real people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please read my update for why what CNN is saying is basically sweeping this whole thing under the rug.  They are using this as an excuse to minimize the public&#39;s perception of a threat.  They are defining &quot;metadata&quot; as &quot;length of call and telephone number.&quot;  That&#39;s like defining the metadata of a jpeg as &quot;file type and file size.&quot;  Right, those data are included, but also included are everything ranging from exposure setting to GPS location.  Likely they know everything your phone is capable of telling them, as Verizon would have no reason to filter this data out before sending it to the government.</p>

You realize that is just a giant circle jerk right?  If you &quot;know&quot; they won&#39;t stop as you say you do, then your only option is to stop using cell phones/internet/GPS or to do it in a way that protects yourself from being tracked.

    <div class="md"><p>Caveat: I&#39;m not an expert.    </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve gathered the situation is this:  There are huge database centers being built to store a metric fuckton of data.  There have been several whistleblowers.    </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-3K3rkPRE">Here is one such whistleblower</a>.   </p>

<p>Everything that&#39;s come out up till now is &quot;you wouldn&#39;t fucking believe this.  This is huge.&quot; but there&#39;s never been proof.  Watch the whistleblower above to understand this general sense. It&#39;s also come out that US senators, even those on the Senate intelligence committee haven&#39;t been told the true extent of this program, nor at they at liberty to speak publicly about what they know.  </p>

<p>What came out yesterday is proof that the government was snooping one network for a period of a few months.  It is 99% likely that the program goes well beyond this.  We wouldn&#39;t have been hearing murmurings for so long over a program of this scale.  </p>

<p>The technology exists to track, record, and store the content of your Skype calls.  That came out after the Arab Spring, where people breaking into the Egyptian secret police headquarters found evidence of a company that supplied this tech out of Germany.  The US government therefore certainly has similar technology.   </p>

<p>So it depends if you are asking if &quot;this specific leak&quot; deals with VoIP and third party SMS.  No it does not.  My gut tells me this leak is the tip of the iceberg and is intended as a red herring to make the whole thing seems minimal, and perhaps to inculcate the discussion with early signals that it should be acceptable.    </p>

<p>My gut also tells me that the program goes well beyond what&#39;s revealed in this specific leak. I would guess that full surveillance has been ongoing for some time, and covers phone, sms, VoIP, third party SMS, email, and other online communications. This CAN also cover such information as your usernames and passwords. During the aforementioned breaking in Egyptian secret police headquarters, files held on activists included Skype usernames and passwords associated to such information as phone records, physical addresses, and emails.   </p>

<p><strong>KEEP IN MIND HOWEVER</strong> that this leak does cover metadata, which is crucial to understanding the importance of what&#39;s happening. The metadata they have will <em>almost certainly</em> allow them to pinpoint you if you have 3g turned on.  So if you&#39;re a smartphone user with 3g, they have you tracked to the pint of where you are in your home (or where your phone is) probably going back at least a few years.   Again, this specific leak is for a specified period of time, but there is no telling the full extent, because this has been &quot;legal&quot; since after 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to piggy back on top of you and suggest a few things.</p>

<p>If you have iOS, you will never have any good support for encryption/privacy both on device (physical data) and off device (calls/sms/data sent/received etc. etc.) <strong>Android has support for encrypting the phone and SD card</strong>, as well as allowing you to do anything you want in day to day operations. There are also great apps that can encrypt your phone calls and messages, although this poses a problem because the people you are communicating with will need these apps too. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone&amp;amp;hl=en"><strong>RedPhone</strong></a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&amp;amp;hl=en"><strong>TextSecure</strong></a> have the communications bases covered, and <strong>a VPN is recommended for any data you wish to be private.</strong> </p>

<p>It makes me sad, scared, and sick that I&#39;m a sophomore in college and I have to be this worried about my own privacy already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I occasionally post stuff like this on Facebook and Twitter, only to have it completely ignored or maybe get 1 like from a friend of mine in law school. <strong>The majority of the public is refusing to pay attention to stories like this</strong>. It&#39;s not ignorance or lack of information, but rather a refusal to form a political opinion out of fear of backlash (either disagreements with friends or the idea that its &quot;not cool&quot; to talk politics). Bottom line: nobody will care until its their family and friends being targeted. By that point though, it&#39;s already too late.</p>

<p>It is either hard core denial mode, or they are stand-up guys. 
Doubt it on the latter.</p>

<p>All of the people in r/conspiratard or whatever it&#39;s called are eating their words. Those people sit around and make fun of us, but when our conspiracy comes to be truth, where are they? Busy hammering down the next topic. I think that group is ran by government employees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK about that , in a big way; It was always kind of &#39;out there&#39;. It&#39;s funny seeing the way MSM handling it already. I keep hearing the word &quot;unusual&quot; </p>

<p>Anyone that spends a significant amount of time here in r/conspiracy knows that <em>everytime</em> an agency has asked for records, the telecoms have provided. Those records have been used in court cases for years now. MSM just didnt want to pay attention to that because of the criminal prosecution surrounding every incident of civil infringement. But <em>NOW</em>? Now that its a blanket snooping on everyone, watch them carry it. (Because now its their civil liberties too)</p>
