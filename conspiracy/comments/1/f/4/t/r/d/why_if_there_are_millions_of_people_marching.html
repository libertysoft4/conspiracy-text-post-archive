    <div class="md"><p>I think its because the coverage was disproportionate to the mass (yes, the weight - like that song The Band sang) of the protests that organized itself so seamlessly and effortlessly across 50+ countries to resist what is nothing less than a textbook example of corporate cronyism, regulatory capture and the obvious and expected outpour of apathy from the majority of the western world in response.</p>

<p>You know there very well, highly likely, could be a time when these laws are no longer in public, similar to some of the laws we hear whispers about from whistleblowers (endangered species) and even the secret interpretations the govt holds close to their chest for many of the laws that are public.</p>

<p>So how are we going to spend out time, arguing over semantics and swapping links or can we please return the slap to the face given to every american by monsanto in the name of greed and profit and all at the expense of the whole fucking planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there weren&#39;t millions. Just a few thousand here and there, not really any different to a PETA protest or any other groups who have a pet peeve. The people who did turn up clearly have been misinformed about GM and food science in general. Genetic engineering isn&#39;t without risks, but the benefits almost certainly outweigh the risks. Much of the opposition to &quot;GMO&quot; food is based in a misunderstanding of the technology. The problem with all of this anti-GMO sentiment is that it is going to create a mob mentality against scientific techniques that have a shot at really helping humanity. Monsanto may have made some mistakes in the past, but it isn&#39;t the fault of the science, it is the fault of past business practices.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from Norman Borlaug:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They&#39;ve never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they&#39;d be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The things this guy mentioned are legitimate concerns, and are not all the results of irrational GMO hysteria. People who came here from &#39;tooshort&#39;s link, ease off the mob mentality.</p>

<p>Luckily, friedsushi, the &quot;suicide genes&quot; that cause the second generation of plants to be sterile haven&#39;t been commercialized by Monsanto or anyone else. However, they may have used the threat of it as leverage to make some pretty exploitative contracts that forbid farmers from saving or selling seeds from their harvests.</p>

<p>So, your £1M question: Why are the anti-GMO posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> getting downvoted?</p>

<p>a) The illuminati are mindcontrolling people to vote and post in-line with their agenda.</p>

<p>b) Monsato is hiring people to defend themselves on forums, and many more to vote down opposition.</p>

<p>c) People on the thread think that the claims of the anti-GMO lobby are exaggerated and don&#39;t believe there to be a conspiracy in the media not making a big deal of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, thank you for your valuable and well thought out input Weetdastic.</p>

<p>If only those silly GMO protestors from the western white elite class of the world had ever known true physical hunger, they would then go about crying out for Monsanto to produce more 1-planting-only GM food crops so that they could make sure the hungry got to eat only as long as they could first pay Monsanto to make nature work for them again after it stopped working one season after buying their genetically modified organisms.</p>

<p>If only Monsanto could spread those seeds the world over for ALL foodcrops! If only those elite protesters knew the good works Monsanto was doing.</p>

<p>You are a shill and a liar. They make genetically modify foods to genetically modify YOU, or at least to modify your actions to benefit them by taking control of the plant process. This is one the most despicable enterprises in all of human history, and that is why there were worldwide protests against it yesterday in 400 cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes they&#39;re earned because someone trying to look very clever is made to see that they are not, and then they go and call their friends who are in ideological opposition to the one making the crier look less clever, so they all jump on a bandwagon and role around together reinforcing each other&#39;s banalities and petty mindsets, then they come and press &quot;-&quot;, and get together laughing about how awesome they are for letting someone like me personally dictate their lives for however much time they spend on me and trying to recover the loss in clever points that encountering someone with an IQ over 85 caused for them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even an issue they are arguing, it&#39;s just about personal internet clever points - which is why these people are not yet in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, because they have not progressed to that point mentally yet, and are still mainly self-focused, and caring more about personality than principles. More about belief and faith than reason and reality, and more about reinforcing their own group delusion than entering into conversation that requires logic because it is about a place called &#39;the real world&#39;, where individuals and companies do not serve your best interests just because you would like them to and think your favorite US-presidential candidate should hold them accountable and keep them honest.</p>

<p>This makes about 8 or 9 friends called from the original poster to make petty and near-meaningless comments to a thread where they aren&#39;t really doing anything but reinforcing for themselves the group mentality of superiority which can only be maintained if they remain together on said bandwagon, because if they are separated(as I am, posting alone, not calling friends to downvote you and tack meaningless angry nothings onto your posts) they cannot stand up to anything but arguments where they try to focus on grammatical errors or faulty uses of the word &quot;object&quot;.</p>

<p>This was the most orangered inbox replies I have ever had in 1 night - 6 of them - and I open it only to find out it&#39;s 6 different people in a dead thread with less than 100 posts in it in total, trying to defend Monsanto or add to discrediting what I type ..in a thread on the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> board that isn&#39;t that interesting, all of whom try to pick out some rhetorical object I use and act as if they&#39;ve undone &#39;my cleverness&#39; and I&#39;m crazy for speaking ill of Monsanto. </p>

Go away or go and reread my post and express yourself in a way not centered on a piece of it that you don&#39;t understand and which is not necessary to the overall post/posts.</p>

<p>If only those silly GMO protestors from the western white elite class of the world had ever known true physical hunger, they would then go about crying out for Monsanto to produce more 1-planting-only GM food crops so that they could make sure the hungry got to eat only as long as they could first pay Monsanto to make nature work for them again after it stopped working one season after buying their genetically modified organisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most crop seed is only used once, i.e. subsequent harvests are from purchased seed. This is due to it being relatively inefficient to collect seeds from the plants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common tactic that. Ignore everything I just said and then talk about something else, because facts are really pesky aren&#39;t they?</p>

<p>Tell me why you went from thinking I&#39;m on the Monsanto payroll to asking why I&#39;m not a participant in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Is it because actually looking through my posting history would prove to you that I&#39;m NOT on the Monsanto payroll and that your earlier assumption was utterly incorrect? </p>

<p>See, the thing is, you can&#39;t possibly consider yourself to be wrong about anything because that may highlight your own fallibility. Because of that, you&#39;d then have to accept other things you believe may not be true. At which point, it&#39;s a psychological house of cards.</p>

<p>So, please tell me why I&#39;m a &#39;Monsanto shill&#39; other than the fact I didn&#39;t believe what you were saying earlier. Because that&#39;s hardly proof, is it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also how payed shills work, son. They find a post that opposes the corporate entity they are employed by, ignore what is written in it, and call the poster crazy even though he is basically saying that 2+2 does indeed = 4.</p>

<p>None of them are really able to converse, they&#39;ll try to find a grammatical error in it and get stuck there not realizing how sad a strategy that is, son. Yeah, son. Son, ya&#39; see what happens when someone isn&#39;t able to use their mind is they become like you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m suffering from paranoid delusions and I&#39;m out of my mind for suggesting that a multinational corporation desperately trying to maintain public press (or quiet in the press about them as this thread is about) would try to nip bad opinions in the bud on the largest social news media site in the world during days of protest against them which is global? Yeah, it&#39;s not like they have a whole department paid to dedicate themselves to doing things like that. You&#39;re right, I&#39;m sure nutso-off my rocker. I&#39;m not the one being crazy, and I&#39;m a lot saner than you are if you are incapable of making these connections on your own. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like corporate entities would want to direct public opinion of themselves and curtail any cogent negative criticism. No, no, that&#39;s basically the same as suggesting that the moon is made out of cheese and that the president is the antichrist. You&#39;re so right, much righter than me. You&#39;re so smart, and you&#39;re so right! You&#39;re just so intelligent and I&#39;m out of my league. Maybe if I go over to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and figure out how to post &quot;lol! dese guyz tink major korperations of da werld arent serving der best interestz! hahaha fukken idiots! haha!&quot; I can get on your level.</p>

<p>If only I could be as smart as you I might be able to go around reddit in teams calling anyone who disagrees with me crazy while not being able to direct any of my anger at their post because I&#39;m not actually intellectually capable of opposing what they say, only calling them crazy for stating plain rational facts and ideas. Welcome to your life. Who is the crazy one, son? What an embarrassment to humanity you are. The reason I think you and your group work for Monsanto is because no one is dumb enough to do that on their own time ..but you&#39;re telling me that you are..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care about you, I don&#39;t care who you really are, what I do care about and find interesting is that the only post I have ever had a brigade of ad hominem attackers spamming my inbox from is a post about Monsanto. Ever. In years of redditing, that&#39;s it. Not even a very popular thread, and a post without any real inclusion of the &quot;theory&quot; part of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. This is what I find interesting.</p>

<p>I know you are from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> because one of your friends saw that I was actually a lot more intelligent than all of you, that you were behaving in exactly the way you believe <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posters behave, and informed me that that&#39;s where all of you came from. It stopped when my grammatical error(which wasn&#39;t a grammatical error, it was a 5-word example of the use of hyperbole as a rhetorical device clarified in the next sentence with factual information) was cleared up and none of you children could make yourself feel intelligent by talking to me.</p>

<p>All of you from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> vastly overestimate your own importance by PMing me, have some serious issues with self-aggrandizing, are overly emotional, don&#39;t use their brains thoroughly enough, and are easily tricked/toyed with and trolled. You&#39;re one of them, stop messaging me. What kind of disgusting little fuck doesn&#39;t have better things to do than harass someone who says Monsanto isn&#39;t the new Christ.</p>

<p>You are the only people who would ever PM me this way or stalk my posts in groups, you&#39;re fucking weirdos or you&#39;re paid to do what you are doing - one is the rational conclusion, the other requires you and your group to be severely unstable individuals acting in concert, and you should stop harassing me. You kids are the only people who do this shit, and you&#39;re pretty fucking crazy and lack in reason.</p>

<p>&quot;it actually makes me feel quite bad for you&quot; ..<strong>how do you think I feel about you?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one really knows why stuff goes viral, or why some posts on Reddit hit the front page and others don&#39;t. It isn&#39;t an exact science. What you&#39;ve done however, is attribute this to some giant conspiracy.. which is fucking hilarious.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m going back to my original point, because you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on there. I want to show you as the crackpot you are for calling me a Monsanto shill. But apparently you don&#39;t care enough to say either way anymore, even though you were SURE I worked for Monsanto earlier. Why has your tune changed? Is it because you might have been wrong about me?</p>

<p>You&#39;re more intelligent than all of us, but are unable to prove that I AM a Monsanto shill? Seems legit..</p>

<p>I&#39;m not PMing you. I&#39;m replying to you in the thread. PM stands for &#39;private message&#39; - something I have not sent you.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s the only rational conclusion that I&#39;m a paid shill for Monsanto, then how come my internet footprint says otherwise? Do you really think I&#39;ve spent the last fifteen years on the internet creating a false identity just so I can eventually corner &#39;thereisnosuchthing&#39; about their Monsanto conspiracy? Yeah, because that&#39;s logical and makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>So again, please provide proof that I work for Monsanto. Really, I want to see it. </p>

<p>If you are unable to read through and understand them, then you do not meet the intelligence requirement necessary to participate in this discussion(as low a bar as that is, having been set by you and your friends). If you are seriously unable to grasp the concepts being typed out there, in those posts, and you still think that I am accusing you of being a paid shill employed by the Monsanto corporation, then you must be below average intelligence and I don&#39;t believe that you could possible have a job that allows you access to a computer or the internet, so it looks like I just caught you in a lie.</p>

<p>How embarrassing it would be though, for me for you, if you were really reading stuff like this aloud to coworkers. You must be the loser at work that everyone kind of tolerates but nobody really respects. Go back and reread the posts that you are trying to reply to.</p>

<p>Yes, I am infinitely more intelligent than you. I know that you think you are the only person on reddit and quite possibly the only person the world aside from me, but there are others in existence too who have been PMing me along the same lines of your posts <em>(&quot;you&#39;re crazy Monsanto doesn&#39;t have a public relations department thereisnosuchthing hahaha rofl you&#39;re delusional major corporations don&#39;t use the internet to influence public opinion or inject themselves into debate where ever they might see their company name on the largest social media site on the planet after facebook and we all know that Monsanto has nothing but great ideas and you&#39;re so dumb for thinking Monsanto would do anything bad ever ever loL!&quot;)</em>, so I&#39;m not keeping track of your names. </p>

<p>You are delusional and you need to take stock of and deal with reality. You are no longer warranting my time and this discussion is an idiot trying to find a way to enjoy intellectual discussions that he isn&#39;t able to be a part of because right inference and correct reasoning isn&#39;t something you&#39;re capable of.

<p>I&#39;m not reading these aloud to the office. I&#39;m copying the text and emailing my team. It&#39;s been a source of much amusement this morning.</p>

<p>I also like, how every time I reply, your response becomes less and less intelligible, as though the rational part of your brain is trying to peek through the fog of delusion, only to be stymied at the last moment, enabling you to parrot the same things I said to you a few paragraphs back as your own original content. Come on dude, get some originality.</p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t answered my original question either.</p>

<p>Why do you think I am on the Monsanto payroll? Just because I disagreed with your earlier premise does not constitute proof. It just means I disagree with you.</p>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t be difficult for an infinitely intelligent being, especially since you&#39;re also infinitely more intelligent that Stephen Hawking and Einstein combined. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you keep placing emphasis on &#39;intelligence&#39; like it&#39;s a trading card. In fact, intellect has nothing to do with conspiracy proponents because I know a couple of highly intelligent people who also happen to believe in the chemtrail bullshit. It&#39;s cognitive dissonance at play here, not intellect.</p>

<p>And yes, you accused me several times of being on the Monsanto payroll. I like how you&#39;ve tried to back out of that one. Most amusing.</p>

<p>Throughout this tiresome exchange, you&#39;ve repeatedly made assumptions about me, my character and who I work for. I&#39;ve not done any of that with you. I&#39;ve merely called you on your bullshit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty telling when someone doesn&#39;t have any facts on their side that they&#39;d resort to assumptions, fallacious arguments, name-calling and mental gymnastics to try to &#39;prove a point&#39;..</p>

<p>That way it would be far too absurd to ignore. But a one day march can easily be taken care of with a well funded media blackout.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where I don&#39;t care. Nice response though.</p>

<p>Just kidding. I think most people, saving you and your friends, have the intelligence level necessary to interpret the use of a metaphor. Nice attempt at juvenile/childish/crazy belittling with no substantive input though. Maybe some day your brain will become more functional and you can join us here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as more than just a fly buzzing around a pile of shit(anything including the name &quot;Monsanto&quot;) contributing nothing but an annoying buzzing noise and shit-larvae droppings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its because the coverage was disproportionate to the mass (yes, the weight - like that song The Band sang) of the protests that organized itself so seamlessly and effortlessly across 50+ countries to resist what is nothing less than a textbook example of corporate cronyism, regulatory capture and the obvious and expected outpour of apathy from the majority of the western world in response.</p>

<p>You know there very well, highly likely, could be a time when these laws are no longer in public, similar to some of the laws we hear whispers about from whistleblowers (endangered species) and even the secret interpretations the govt holds close to their chest for many of the laws that are public.</p>

<p>So how are we going to spend out time, arguing over semantics and swapping links or can we please return the slap to the face given to every american by monsanto in the name of greed and profit and all at the expense of the whole fucking planet. </p>

<p>(Blah blah they aren&#39;t killing the planet, or they are, it doesn&#39;t matter because it is getting killed and that&#39;s the REAL issue at stake)</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association, comparison or resemblance including allegory, hyperbole, and simile.</strong></p>

<p>Now reread that definition.</p>

<p>&quot;genetically modifying seeds to genetically modify you&quot; - meaning, it doesn&#39;t have to be a literal rhetorical object. I go on directly after that sentence to explain that it is hyperbole meant to imply genetically altered foods that alter your body(which they do) and alter a private entity&#39;s control over the plant process on planet earth. <strong>Hyperbole is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech, if you didn&#39;t know.</strong></p>

<p>Funny how Monsanto shills are working overtime to shut down negative press online - no other group with worldwide protests against them has people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on the largest social news aggregator in the world to shut down debate and call in 5-10 others to make one-line negative (but unsubstantial and petty) posts in response to anyone calling them out. You jumped on a completely meaningless part of my post to try and remove credibility from it, and all you did was show everyone that there is a monsantho shill train that can be called overnight to add 10 comments to a relatively dead and unimportant thread (<strong>but it&#39;s real important to the peple being paid to monitor it!</strong>) and dump 50-100 downvotes(until a comment is hidden) in threads that don&#39;t even have that many commenters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care about you, I don&#39;t care who you really are, what I do care about and find interesting is that the only post I have ever had a brigade of ad hominem attackers spamming my inbox from is a post about Monsanto. Ever. In years of redditing, that&#39;s it. Not even a very popular thread, and a post without any real inclusion of the &quot;theory&quot; part of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. This is what I find interesting.</p>

<p>I know you are from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> because one of your friends saw that I was actually a lot more intelligent than all of you, that you were behaving in exactly the way you believe <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posters behave, and informed me that that&#39;s where all of you came from. It stopped when my grammatical error(which wasn&#39;t a grammatical error, it was a 5-word example of the use of hyperbole as a rhetorical device clarified in the next sentence with factual information) was cleared up and none of you children could make yourself feel intelligent by talking to me.</p>

<p>All of you from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> vastly overestimate your own importance by PMing me, have some serious issues with self-aggrandizing, are overly emotional, don&#39;t use their brains thoroughly enough, and are easily tricked/toyed with and trolled. You&#39;re one of them, stop messaging me. What kind of disgusting little fuck doesn&#39;t have better things to do than harass someone who says Monsanto isn&#39;t the new Christ.</p>

<p>You are the only people who would ever PM me this way or stalk my posts in groups, you&#39;re fucking weirdos or you&#39;re paid to do what you are doing - one is the rational conclusion, the other requires you and your group to be severely unstable individuals acting in concert, and you should stop harassing me. You kids are the only people who do this shit, and you&#39;re pretty fucking crazy and lack in reason.</p>

<p>&quot;it actually makes me feel quite bad for you&quot; ..<strong>how do you think I feel about you?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one really knows why stuff goes viral, or why some posts on Reddit hit the front page and others don&#39;t. It isn&#39;t an exact science. What you&#39;ve done however, is attribute this to some giant conspiracy.. which is fucking hilarious.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m going back to my original point, because you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on there. I want to show you as the crackpot you are for calling me a Monsanto shill. But apparently you don&#39;t care enough to say either way anymore, even though you were SURE I worked for Monsanto earlier. Why has your tune changed? Is it because you might have been wrong about me?</p>

<p>You&#39;re more intelligent than all of us, but are unable to prove that I AM a Monsanto shill? Seems legit..</p>

<p>I&#39;m not PMing you. I&#39;m replying to you in the thread. PM stands for &#39;private message&#39; - something I have not sent you.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s the only rational conclusion that I&#39;m a paid shill for Monsanto, then how come my internet footprint says otherwise? Do you really think I&#39;ve spent the last fifteen years on the internet creating a false identity just so I can eventually corner &#39;thereisnosuchthing&#39; about their Monsanto conspiracy? Yeah, because that&#39;s logical and makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>So again, please provide proof that I work for Monsanto. Really, I want to see it. </p>

<p>Why do you think i am on the Monsanto payroll?</p>

<p>If i&#39;m on their payroll, then please explain why my 15 year internet footprint disagrees with this.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve called me a paid shill in almost every one of your responses!! How can you not remember this? You wrote them yourself!</p>

<p>Infinitely more intelligent you say? Intelligent enough to mistake a PM for a reply... lol.</p>
