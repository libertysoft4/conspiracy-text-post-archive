<p><em>Let&#39;s say, for the sake of argument, that chemtrails actually exist. Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get: why are conspiracy theorists just sitting around and moaning and bitching about it? The thing is, if you know what you&#39;re doing, you could almost overnight get to the bottom of the plot. For example, using a DIY spectrograph, you could determine what was being dropped; you could also write an app for people to record chemtrail sightings, their time and location. From that, you could probably determine who was in on the plot by whether or not they consistently were out of the region being dropped with chemicals. If you really believe that these are chemtrails, a determined conspiracy theorist could completely unmask the plot with real evidence fairly easily. But of course you won&#39;t, because you either don&#39;t really believe your own conspiracy theory, are afraid of it being falsified or prefer just bitching about something you can&#39;t even prove exists.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A study was done a few years ago to correlate sightings of contrails with meteorological data. A team of spotters was recruited across the US who provided daily reports of trails in their area – length, duration, frequency etc. This information was sealed until weather data for each location could be downloaded and analysed, then a team predicted what they thought the likelihood of contrails would be for each location based on factors like temperature and humidity. They were all able to predict with almost complete accuracy when extended contrails would cover the sky, and when there would be none. The truth is, there is a simple scientific explanation for every phenomena in the sky. No conspiracy needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s the geoengineering debate.  There are plenty of health and safety issues here.  </p>

<p>Of course there is such a thing as chemtrails.  Of course contrails are often mistaken for chemtrails.  Of course spraying barium and aluminum and aerosols into the stratosphere should be up to public scrutiny.  Of course nobody is going to want to admit this is going on.  There are proven consequences (with vocanoes as the tests).</p>

<p>Companies involved in geoengineering are going to make a LOT of money.  This is a very real argument that needs to be had.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say, for the sake of argument, that they were NOT deliberately spraying heavy metals into the atmosphere. Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get: if they DID decide to take the world&#39;s vote and go ahead and begin spraying heavy metals to in the atmosphere to &quot;stop global warming&quot;...how would it look any different than how the skies look today? (It would look NO different) </p>

<p>Would there be ANY scientific reason to put heavy metals into the atmosphere? Even a child could think of more than one, how many reasons could a scientist come up with? (Possibly more than a child)</p>

<p>Has the military performed classified projects in the past? (Yes)</p>

<p>Do they need your permission to perform experiments on the weather? (No)</p>

<p>Have people tried to influence the weather since the beginning of time? (YES)</p>
