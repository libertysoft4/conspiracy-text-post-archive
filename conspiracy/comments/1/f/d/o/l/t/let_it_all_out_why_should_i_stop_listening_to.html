    <div class="md"><p>We, as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, must always be weary about who we trust or listen to. Alex Jones, as previously said, seems to be making the pursuit of truth into a money making machine. He is no longer just stating facts, he is building an empire and constructing an image for himself. He benefits by &quot;spreading news&quot;, and truthfully, we should not be listening to those who can personally benefit from what news they release, or the press they get by doing so.</p>

<p>Also, Alex Jones has just gone off the deep end. He believes what he believes, and he is full of himself to the point that &quot;what he says is Gospel.&quot; Basically, Alex Jones is that one weird friend who you keep around because you liked him at one point, but now find him creepy, close-minded, and arrogant. He is vicious, he is like a caged animal...I would rather get my information from someone I know is loving, honest, and in it for the right reasons. And I don&#39;t feel like Alex Jones is that man.</p>

<p>Other than that he is one of the best out there at this point unfortunately, so until you can find someone better, I&#39;d stick with getting your news from him and his networks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he takes good content and screams it at you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/">Check James Corbett out</a>. I stopped listening to Jones once I found him. It&#39;s the same great content (better even??) but using reason in place of volume.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve become a big fan of his and am surprised he doesn&#39;t show up here more.  I&#39;m hoping my recent spamming (is 2 posts and 2 comments in 3 days spam?) of his content will turn some people in to him.</p>

<p>Edit: I should note that I still check in on Alex Jones periodically. I&#39;ve just taken my daily podcast listening time over to James Corbett now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is gonna sound pretty crazy but if such a thing as the illuminati really exists then Alex Jones is one of them, specifically a disinfo agent. In the interview where he asks David Gergen about bohemian grove the thought occurred to me, that the only way pudgy alex jones COULD have snuck in there (a place where the global elite hangs out) would be if he was allowed to be their.. I mean he&#39;s no secret agent... David Gergen keeps saying that &quot;he violated understandings&quot;.. Its just really weird!! </p>

<p>Sorry if this seems ridiculous, just a random thought</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They&#39;re doing it for A) profit or B) an ulterior motive (to sell the things you see). </p>

<p>Only when the direct value of what you are receiving can be equally reflected to who is providing it, shall information be accurately represented and exchanged. </p>

<p>For instance, the No Agenda podcast is a radio show that has zero advertising. Adam Curry (former MTV Headbangers Ball host) and John C. Dvorak (PC Mag columnist and long time tech voice) run the gig. You can find the latest stream including all the show notes, sources, etc., at <a href="/r/InTheMorning">/r/InTheMorning</a></p>

<p>Free to listen and they even have a chat room when the show is live. </p>

<p>What to take away from this, is when you donate to the show, you become a producer of the show. You get mentioned, perhaps you have an anecdote to share. And you can use the Producer label as <em>real</em> credits on your LinkedIn and imdb profiles. </p>

<p>It costs nothing to listen. And if you don&#39;t like the Internet, Adam even broadcasts the show on HAM radios. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is so much simpler than everyone seems to assume it should be. </p>

<p>You should cease listening to Alex Jones because the opposition has cast him as &quot;our leader&quot;. Full stop. There&#39;s no need to discuss the lack of accuracy, the obvious gamesmanship of turning a buck on fear, his Bohemian Grove reveal that was the beginning of the end for his credibility, or his obvious predilection for drama.</p>

<p>We must <em>disperse</em> our attention like rational adults in search of evidence backed truth. This is in direct opposition to the empire that Alex Jones has become, and of his own choosing allegedly. </p>

<p>Every time we give someone like Alex Jones the power to speak for a whole that does not exist, the Media will look to make that whole a tangible entity. And they will make someone we hold up like Jones it&#39;s face. Therefore, when THE MEDIA, the biggest most effective goddamn propaganda machine ever created speaks to the public we desperately need to reach out to ourselves, <strong>we appear on the Piers Morgan show looking like a total fucking jackass.</strong></p>

<p>YES, there are other voices. YES, we should operate as individuals. YES, we should be more critical of the information we get before passing it along. Those are valid, often discussed topics regarding the inefficiencies of &#39;the movement&#39;. But when we passively endorse a person who frankly <em>embodies</em> all of our worst traits, you bet your ass the opposition is going to make that man first a star, and then a puppet, and then an executioner for what he purports to represent. </p>

<p>At this level, what Jones&#39; intentions are become inconsequential. At this level, the opposition controls the Alex Jones empire, and by association, him. At this point, even though sheer inaction, Jones can destroy the very real collective of individuals who are truth seekers. </p>

<p>We are at a very dangerous time in our country. The opposition is very powerful within it&#39;s systems of war and law. We The People cannot afford such a powerful opposition the kind of gift basket that Alex Jones has become. I have no ill will towards the man personally, I do not know him. But his empire hangs over the genuine efforts of so many like silent knife, always waiting for the downstroke. </p>

<p>Now when you talk to people about alternative news, the go to is &#39;oh like that Alex Jones guy? He&#39;s kind of a nutter.&#39; This is exactly the desired effect of putting Jones on the Morgan carnival circuit. To place an immediate chill on any discussion that doesn&#39;t immediately follow established Corporate Media narratives. </p>

<p>This is why you must not listen to Alex Jones. He is compromised, it&#39;s very clear. I wish him luck, because he&#39;ll need it. But he doesn&#39;t represent any of what I and more then a few other People in this country and the world understand to be the importance of knowing the truth. </p>

All of us sees what it going on, but we don&#39;t know all the players, we are not a hundred percent on the motives, all we can do is see which guess is best.

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is someone who fights the establishment for a living and this occasionally results in him blowing his whistle a bit too hard over something that is relatively benign. His explosive temperament does absolutely nothing for his credibility and I usually feel some form of second-hand embarrassment whenever I hear him speak.</p>

<p>That said, I still have some respect for Alex Jones because at the end of the day, he is fighting the good fight and I know that he truly means well.</p>
