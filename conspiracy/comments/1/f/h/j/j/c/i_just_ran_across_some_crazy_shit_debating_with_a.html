        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So yesterday, someone <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fei7y/south_korea_follows_japan_to_ban_all_us_wheat/ca9n3i6">linked</a> to a peer-reviewed study saying that GMO corn gives rats cancer. The comment was downvoted without comment.   </p>

<p>So I looked into it.  It seemed like a legit study.  But the pro-GMO crowd were adamant that &quot;all scientists now agree that this study was a fraud.&quot;  That&#39;s what you keep hearing when you debate with these types.   </p>

<p>Today I was linked by one of them <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512008022">here</a>.  It&#39;s another display of the study, this time with responses.  I read the critique, but it was total bullshit.  </p>

<p>It made 2 claims.<br/>
1) The study didn&#39;t have a control group.  BUT: If you look at the raw data this is clearly not true.<br/>
2)  The data don&#39;t support the conclusion that GMOs cause tumors.  BUT: Again, if you look at the data, this is not true.   </p>

<p>So I think hmm.  Weird.  I google the ones who wrote the letter bashing the study.  They&#39;re from a group called ANBio.   Guess who funds ANBio?  Yup.  <a href="http://www.powerbase.info/index.php/ANBio">Monsanto</a>.  </p>

<p>And DuPont.  For good measure.   So surely with Monsanto paying their paychecks they just wanted good science to win out, right?  That&#39;s why they went after that study, right?</p>

<p>So the next time a pompous redditor tells you the &quot;Rat GMO&quot; study is bogus, keep in mind that it isn&#39;t.  The take down of this study was funded by Monsanto and the data are online <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637">here</a> for all to see. </p>

<p>As always, when you put the time in to research for 10 minutes, you end up down a rabbit hole of corruption.\</p>

<p>Edit:  Some people asked for sources on the claim that academics can be bought, and asked about the fracking example I used.  Please refer to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/440/game-changer">this</a> episode of This American Life where they run through the issue.  It&#39;s only an hour long or you can read the transcript.</p>

<p>Edit2:</p>

<p>Now that this horseshit is linked on Yahoo:  Here&#39;s what I want to say:</p>

<p>I&#39;m advocating for 2 things:    </p>

<p>1) Better debate. That means anyone can test the stuff. The seeds can&#39;t be proprietary when it comes to research. More independent testing is done before rolling them out wide scale. Let&#39;s actually figure out what this shit is before everyone has to eat it everyday.    </p>

<p>2) This bullshit about not labeling GMO in the US needs to stop. If it is a good product then labeling won&#39;t hurt it. Give people information. Arguing against labeling is evil in my opinion.  Put the facts out, and let the people decide whether they want it or not.</p>

<p>And immediately the shills try to bury the truth. 4 downvotes in 30 minutes, 60 in 3 hours. That&#39;s 60 votes denying the validation clearly given by OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t gaming.  They&#39;re just relying on you to do two things:</p>

<p>1) Be lazy.<br/>
2) Be intimidated by &quot;SCIENCE&quot;  </p>

<p>Seriously everyone: Go look at this study.  This is the big one and it&#39;s the one all these pro-GMO people are dismissing out of hand as being bullshit.</p>

<p>It has been criticized by people paid by Monsanto, and their criticism is not even valid.  You can go look at the data and the photos of the rats yourself. Don&#39;t believe this shit that you have to be a trained scientist to read a study.  Take your time, discuss, post questions.  Get your ass through that study and educate yourself.</p>

<p>The &quot;scientific consensus&quot; on this issue is bullshit.  After digging into this I am actually much more worried and upset than I was before.  This is big.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I just hate this attitude of &quot;I am right BECAUSE SCIENCE.&quot;  Especially with GMOs.  I think science has it&#39;s place (obviously) but too often it&#39;s corrupted because huge companies can fund research.  Same thing with fracking.  They just bought off whole universities to say it was safe and healthy and all-American good to go.   </p>

<p>And the idiots taking this stance apparently don&#39;t even read the studies and think critically, they just say &quot;Well you&#39;re arguing against SCIENCE and therefore you&#39;re a nutcase.&quot;     </p>

<p>What&#39;s hidden in this attitude is the claim that the scientific method is synonymous with the scientific establishment.  I&#39;m down with the method, but I always, ALWAYS distrust the establishment. But sadly the people who conflate the two ideas come away feeling superior simply because they made a logical error.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s....circular logic, as it&#39;s exactly what the person said. You are again equating the scientific method with the establishment. The method is the method - and operational, intangible utility. The establishment is a system subject to all the things human infest them selves with: politics, corruption, cronyism, fallacies, and all the rest. Those things CANNOT be denied. Worst about it being, they will not arrive at truth when it is not truth that is sought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is science, the practice, and &quot;Science&quot;, the religion.  Most people don&#39;t know science well enough to actually be able to even read a study and deduce for themselves <em>anything</em> from it.  They have to take &quot;Science&quot; on faith.  And they do.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a shortcut to enlightenment where an idiot professes themselves extremely intelligent simply because they know nothing, completely missing the subtext being that all new knowledge only causes infinitely more questions to become possible.  They believe themselves to be capable of thought while the most basic capacity for logical thought escapes them.  </p>

<p>Everything they know is attributed to an external authority rendering the very concept of challenging one of their beliefs not only impossible (without believing they are educated or experienced enough to challenge a real &quot;authority&quot; on the subject) but the idea does not even occur to them.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if it was the education system or some other factor, but I have noticed that the majority of present adults have been taught to defer all authority to external sources.  They must be trained in the procedure instead of understanding the concept allowing them to develop their own procedure.  They are not responsible for their actions because someone else told them what to do.  It is possible to go through ones entire life without ever being responsible for one&#39;s own actions.  Without ever having to ask oneself a critical question.  Obviously you are doing it right, an external authority told you how to do it. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s where it falls apart.  You cannot argue with them.  Logic is irrelevant because the only logic they understand is &quot;but that&#39;s how it is done&quot;.  It is true because someone smarter than them told them it was true.  It is true because their benevolent science, an abstract concept similar but unrelated to the actual Scientific Method, could never allow a harmful chemical or modified organism to be approved.  </p>

<p>But it is not that they refuse to apply logic, it is simply that they have been taught from a very young age that attempting to apply logic to life only causes pain.  They simply follow the rules they are provided at any given time and are happy to receive their tokens redeemable for food pellets and toys in return.  They have not in their adult life experienced any serious self-reflection or self-criticism and are therefore completely incapable of doing so.  Your demand of them to do so is a foreign request.  The only thing they know is deference to external authority.  They literally take science on faith and have no basis of understanding from which to defend their beliefs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also noticed that a lot of people on Reddit have the attitude that because there&#39;s a consensus it must be true. I always get downvoted for saying it but consensus, even among scientists, is not actually science. Consensus just means that a bunch of people decided to agree on something because it benefits them and their agenda....even if it&#39;s complete BS.  Just because someone is a scientist does not mean that they are any more or less honest than anybody else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that I think of it, Monsanto would have to buy off at least 75% of academics in the fields of chemistry, biology, agriculture, and whatever else would be related to GMOs. I mean, if you buy one pro-Monsanto academic study, you would have to pay off the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>the researcher in charge</li>
<li>everyone in that person&#39;s research team</li>
<li>the researcher&#39;s supervising department</li>
<li>the peer review board on every major scientific journal</li>
<li>more studies to prove that study, because nobody on the planet (except the media) gives a fuck about an experiment that can&#39;t be replicated many times by different researchers with any fewer than three standard deviations</li>
<li>more studies that study the studies that prove the original study and check for bias in all previous studies</li>
<li>most of the academic community that would spot bullshit instantly and publish independent studies or something</li>
<li>most professionals working in biology, chemistry, genetics, etc for the same reason as previous</li>
<li>you would also have to do this with foreign countries as well because most of them also have scientists</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a LOT of people you have to pay off if you don&#39;t want that one single study to get smashed to bits within a year or two, if not less. Where do they get that kind of money? Buying a scientific fact is much more difficult than paying off the EPA to let you dump toxic waste in a public lake. You can&#39;t treat them the same. A better comparison would be paying off the EPA to let you get a fire hose and drive around town dousing every building in town with toxic waste. People are gonna notice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even trying to convince you anymore, I&#39;m just legitimately curious as to how you justify this belief. </p>

Monsanto just wasted money buying off one research team, and that one research team will never be respected again in the scientific community.

    <div class="md"><p>Notice how even the link you&#39;ve provided points out how it varies from place to place and there&#39;s different types of labels and certifications. You told people to go with anything labeled Organic. <strong>Literally anyone can label their food organic with no validation or consequence for lying.</strong> (I too can bold the relevant part)</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t stress to look for a certain level of certification or wording, you just told people to trust organic labels because &#39;it&#39;s a start.&#39; That&#39;s frankly not good enough and dangerous advice if they truly are concerned. You need to learn the difference between the word organic and its use as a label and something being certified and by which organization and what qualifications they used.</p>

<p>I encourage you to watch the Bullshit! episode on Organic food labeling in the US. </p>

<p><strong>You need to qualify the word Organic. You CANNOT just trust it. It&#39;s being abused all around you</strong></p>

<p>Not a great source, but it links to good ones and gives a good overview. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s not certified, it didn&#39;t meet the criteria. The usda is pretty lax about the certifying- I&#39;ve seen a few specials on the local news about farms using chemical fertilizers and still passing- and you can only imagine what the farms that don&#39;t meet certification are like. </p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain it was an abc special, if you really want to look into it. </p>

<p>Is this the argument you really think I&#39;m making? I even bolded it for you. No one enforces using the word organic. There is a huge difference between actually having one of the certified logos and just plastering the word on your product. I&#39;m telling people to go the extra mile and actually look into if a product is certified and not just using the word. Read what the fuck I&#39;m writing. I know GMOs are a no go. Is that not obvious? I&#39;m not saying anything that your link isn&#39;t saying. It specifically points out that certification is different than just using the word organic and especially the word natural. </p>

<p>Can you get on board with &quot;look into it and verify it&#39;s actually organic&quot; instead of &quot;eat shit that has the word organic on it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read this long ago. And first of all, you stated that &quot;recently a study came back saying organic food is bad for you&quot;.  That is not what this study says.  It says that there is no difference in nutritional content, but also that 37% of conventional foods had pesticide residues vs 7% for organic.  That in and of itself is a reason to go organic.  Otherwise, the study tries to claim that organics are more nutritious, when the real reason for buying organic is that it&#39;s more environmentally friendly.  Talk about a straw man argument.  I, nor anyone else I know, eats organic because they think it&#39;s nutritionally superior; they eat it because it&#39;s far less likely to be inundated with pesticides and what not. 
And GM food IS NOT the same as traditional hybrid food.  I&#39;m not a science geek and even I understand that.  And vaccines go through rigorous clinical studies to prove their efficacy AND safety...years of testing.  GMO foods does/has not.  In essence, they are conducting trials on humans as we speak, as I would think it would take years to ascertain the effects, or lack therof, of GMO&#39;s on the human body. And I would argue modifying a food at the genetic level, given all of the things we still don&#39;t know about foods and how they effect our bodies, synergies with other foods, etc., makes it even more important that GMO&#39;s are studied before just adding them to everything without letting people know you are doing it. </p>

<p>Read this long ago. And first of all, you stated that &quot;recently a study came back saying organic food is bad for you&quot;. That is not what this study says. It says that there is no difference in nutritional content, but also that 37% of conventional foods had pesticide residues vs 7% for organic. That in and of itself is a reason to go organic. Otherwise, the study tries to claim that organics are more nutritious, when the real reason for buying organic is that it&#39;s more environmentally friendly. Talk about a straw man argument. I, nor anyone else I know, eats organic because they think it&#39;s nutritionally superior; they eat it because it&#39;s far less likely to be inundated with pesticides and what not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Organic food is not more environmental friendly.  I am assuming you are not a farmer and have never been one.  I grew up in a farming area.  I have seen first had that organic farming is bad for the environment.  It damages the land much more so than conventional farming.  Not to mention organic food is more likely to make people sick if it is not properly washed.  Talk about cherry picking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And GM food IS NOT the same as traditional hybrid food. I&#39;m not a science geek and even I understand that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can tell you are not a science geek.  It is the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And vaccines go through rigorous clinical studies to prove their efficacy AND safety...years of testing. GMO foods does/has not.  In essence, they are conducting trials on humans as we speak, as I would think it would take years to ascertain the effects, or lack therof, of GMO&#39;s on the human body. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um again not true.  But you do not care about facts.  YOu just parrot the lies the talking heads spit at you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I would argue modifying a food at the genetic level, given all of the things we still don&#39;t know about foods and how they effect our bodies, synergies with other foods, etc., makes it even more important that GMO&#39;s are studied before just adding them to everything without letting people know you are doing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I would argue that your fear and misunderstanding of science is sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is typical of people arguing for GMO.  You say a lot, but in the final analysis, you have said absolutely nothing.  If what I said about clinical trials is not true, prove it.  Not sure what talking heads you are referring to, but I came to these conclusions on my own based on common sense.  I actually worked for a vaccine company, so no fear of science here.  But I do know when you go personal, that&#39;s all that needs to be said, as it says you have nothing to say.  and lol, organic food is more likely to make people sick if not washed?  Duh.  That goes for anything, but this again says less than nothing.  Poof, begone.  You know not of what you speak.  </p>

I know it goes against what you ignorantly think as you seem to hate science and fear technology but come on.  Get with the times.  Any &quot;study&quot; funded by greenpeace will be horribly inaccurate.  Hell the study this entire thing is about has refused to release the raw data making it impossible for people to replicate.  It also as mentioned earlier contains obvious errors.  I am sorry that you are incapable of looking past headlines.</p>

<p>Organic food is bad,  note it is no better than conventional methods, costs more and damages the environment at a higher rate.  Organic farming methods hurts the environment much more than conventional.  In order to keep organic foods alive and safe from being eaten they use worse pesticides and worse fertilizers.  Enjoy your e-coli.</p>

<p>Oh and do not forget that organic farming employs larger numbers of predator organisms throwing the balance completely out of wack and introducing invasive species of organisms enjoy fucking up nature.</p>

<p>1) The study didn&#39;t have a control group. BUT: If you look at the raw data this is clearly not true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is 100% <strong>not</strong> what the criticism was.  The criticism was this:  This specific breed of rats is prone to cancer, making <strong>any judgments one way or the other about effects of foods is stupid when you use a rat already prone to such high rates of cancer</strong>.  In fact, if you had bothered to read it, you would see that they company which produces the rats used in the study even admits that 76% of the females will <strong>spontaneously</strong> develop mammary gland tumors.  Take a rat breed that is prone to tumors and feed them <em>ad lib</em> (which is what Séralini did), and you get even higher rates of spontaneous tumors, 71% of males and 87% of females.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) The data don&#39;t support the conclusion that GMOs cause tumors. BUT: Again, if you look at the data, this is not true.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to re-emphasize that you cannot come to <strong>any</strong> firm conclusion when you use a model organism that is prone to such high rates of cancer.  <strong>BUT</strong>, for the sake of argument, if any study that claimed GMO caused higher rates of cancer should also be able to explain why in this study, male rates had <strong>lower</strong> rates of cancer.  In other words, if GMO causes tumors, why did fewer males get tumors?  The data from Séralini would actually indicate a potential protective effect on males, but Séralini doesn&#39;t even address this contradicting data.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is big.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t.  You just need to read a little closer and think about what you&#39;re reading.  </p>

<p>And seriously, please note that the letter from de Souza and Oda <strong>do not</strong> support one side or the other of the GMO issue, but simply that the Séralini paper is really bad science on a very basic level.  </p>

Only the final number is real, however many upvotes and downvotes we can see through res are in constant flux.

The problem is even with a professionally written playbook, they aren&#39;t hiring professional arguers like Attorneys, so it&#39;s pretty easy to dismantle their arguments. I wonder when they&#39;re going to drop serious coin to send professionals to argue their points.

    <div class="md"><p>Now I&#39;m curious what you mean by &quot;pro-NRA shills&quot;.  Are you saying pro-gun rights, or actually pro-National Rifle Association shills?  </p>

<p>Because I think the NRA is a strawman organization arguing illogically to make those who have actually read the 2nd Amendment appear to be idiots.  I believe the 2nd Amendment says that the right to bear &quot;Arms&quot; (with a capital A, because they didn&#39;t mean just guns) &quot;shall not be infringed&quot;, because that&#39;s what it says in plain English.  If the NRA was actually intending to defend the 2nd Amendment they would simply point out that no infringement on the right of the people to keep and bear Arms is allowed by the constitution.  End of story.  That&#39;s the only argument that needs to be made.  They are not actually intending to defend the 2nd Amendment.  They are intending to make arguing for the 2nd Amendment untenable.  They disparage Arms rights advocates.  </p>

<p>I assume you are referring to defenders of the corrupted organization no longer defending the rights of the people to keep and bear Arms (if they ever even did).  Or you could be a proponent of modifying the United States Constitution. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not a lawyer, I&#39;m just a stoner who realized a year or two ago that fighting for liberty might take you in strange directions.  I grew up in a anti-gun household.  I don&#39;t own any guns myself, but I am willing to die defending your right to Arm yourself at least as heavily as we allow our civil servants in our government to arm themselves.  I&#39;m not a professional, just someone who wants to pursue happiness and believes everyone else should be able to do the same without being preemptively punished for the possession of an object or substance.  Prohibition is always thoughtcrime.  Killing someone is illegal, but owning a gun is not probable cause of any crime, just like possessing or consuming weed is not evidence of a crime.  I can&#39;t support legalization of cannabis and be against a right actually enumerated in the Constitution.  That would be hypocritical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be a dick, or anti-gun, but your argument (along with most pro-gun arguments) completely ignores the first part of the 2nd Amendment. It starts with &quot;A well regulated militia...&quot; and that part is almost always overlooked when these topics come up.</p>

<p>I truly believe that the Founding Fathers believed that the right to own guns (they were the &#39;arms&#39; of the times) would always be held by citizens, but also that those citizens would be trained in the proper use of those weapons in a manner that would allow them to defend the nation when called upon by the government.</p>

<p>Then again the Founding Fathers also weren&#39;t exactly in agreement on all things, and the Constitution itself is made of compromises between all of them. And let&#39;s not forget they also believed that people of our nation had the right to change the constitution when they felt it necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try replacing Arms with Sugar for illustrative purposes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Sugar] being necessary [for fermented spirits], the right of the people to keep and [use] [Sugar], shall not be infringed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that sentence say that sugar can <em>only</em> be used for fermented spirits?  Absolutely not.</p>

<p>They said &quot;because we all agree that a militia is essential to the freedom of a state, there shall be no restrictions on the right of the people to keep and bear Arms&quot;.  That is not what I <em>think</em> they said, that&#39;s what the 2nd Amendment <em>actually says</em>.  In plain English. </p>

<p>Please, take your time and show me exactly how &quot;A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state...&quot; imposes any limitations.  It is simply one example powerful enough to require no other enumerated examples.  Obviously, to protect themselves from a federal government run amok or any other threat, the states would need to be capable of organizing militias, among other uses for Arms.  </p>

<p>How does enumerating one very important example place any sort of limit on the right of the people to keep and bear Arms?</p>

<p>That first part is not ignored, it&#39;s just misunderstood.  I didn&#39;t mention it because there is no reason to.  It does not limit the second clause of the compound sentence, &quot;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed&quot;.  The second half of the compound sentence stands alone with the first part simply acting to illustrate the necessity of the concept that follows.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed that it did impose any limitations so your &quot;trouncing&quot; was exactly what I called it, a misdirected diatribe. I made a perfectly valid distinction as to why I feel it needs to be included that you have repeatedly and completely overlooked to instead defend a position that isn&#39;t under attack (there should be no limitations). You yet again fall back on ad hominem attacks instead actually finding an error in your own responses.</p>

<p>That is taken directly from the first post I made, you could have easily reread it on your own multiple times. It is actually the main point of the entire post that you some how completely overlooked and instead jumped straight to the conclusion that I wanted to put limitations on gun owner ship (which you have now argued against twice) even though I have directly stated TWICE that I, in know way, believe that. At this point I feel that it more than fair to call into question your reading comprehension skills and motives. You claim that I am trying to use deception to distract, yet completely mischaracterize my arguments repeatedly. What makes this even more curious to me is that your initial response was on a post talking about &#39;NRA shills&#39; and you are now repeatedly pushing NRA talking points without actually addressing anything stated.</p>

<p>Obviously if the right of the people to keep and bear Arms (all types) cannot be infringed, then even your attempt to misrepresent the definition of a common term &quot;Arms&quot; as being only a subset thereof, &quot;guns&quot;.  You are arguing that there are limitations on the right of the people to keep and bear <em>Arms</em> by redefining &quot;Arms&quot; to mean a limited subset of guns.

    <div class="md"><p>talk about a strawman. You literally redefined my statements then argued against them. You are still missing the point completely, and are still insisting that I am talking about limiting ownership. FOR THE 4TH FUCKING TIME: I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE LIMITATION OF OWNERSHIP.

The fact that you keep resorting to the same fallacy over and over is a sign that you either 1)do not understand what is being said 2) are not actually participating in good faith 3)are a worthless troll with nothing to actually add.  </p>

<p>You cant even understand that I wasn&#39;t actually trying to argue your point at all (I&#39;m not sure why thats so hard for you to grasp). I was making addition to your stance and making a clarification that I thought was important. I&#39;m getting the feeling that if I were to say you were right (I actually have agreed multiple times with you) that you would still argue and insist that you were in fact wrong.</p>

<p>And you wonder why I question your mental capacity... HINT: its because you can not understand what is clearly explained to you multiple times. Keep arguing against a proposition I haven&#39;t made though, I find it humorous.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve actually stated 4 times now that I don&#39;t believe in limitations of ownership. I can&#39;t wait to see how you try and spin this to say that I&#39;m insisting that there should be limitations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You first said that your point was that the first clause of the 2nd Amendment is relevant to the discussion.  I said that only distracts from the simplicity of the argument that no limits are imposed on our right to &quot;keep and bear Arms&quot;. </p>

It is a facially illogical argument.  Any six year old with a set of revolution-era war themed Lego® Blocks knows canons and swords and all sorts of other Arms were available at the time.  </p>

<p>So, which is it?  Is the first clause relevant to a discussion or are you trying to convince me that &quot;Arms&quot; actually means &quot;guns&quot;?  Both are illogical, both a distraction from the facts of the matter.  You may think they are contributions but they are not.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Séralini used ten rats per sex per group – the same number of animals as Monsanto analyzed for blood and urine chemistry in its 90-day tests claiming to show that GM foods are safe. This is the same number that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommends for a 90-day subchronic test of the type that Monsanto does on its GM foods, as well as for one of its chronic toxicity protocols. According to statistics experts, groups of this size are enough to show toxicity, but not enough to show safety. This means that industry toxicity studies on this number of rats that claim to show safety are inadequate.</p>

<p>No mandatory protocols exist for GM food safety testing. Industry is free to design its own tests, which are generally weak. Séralini designed a protocol to test the long-term health effects of a GMO and its associated pesticide. His protocol was the first to differentiate between the effects of the GMO and those of the pesticide.</p>

<p>Séralini’s control groups were the same size as each treatment dose group, in line with standard scientific practice. It is not good scientific practice to introduce extra irrelevant “reference” control groups, though Monsanto has routinely done this in its tests on GM foods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a common sense point of view: the purpose of having minimum group sizes is to assure that the experiment is sufficiently powered to show <strong>safety</strong>. A study of 2 rats with no adverse outcomes is not convincing, but study of 200 rats is. If the Seralini study supported the null hypothesis, then the objection &quot;not enough rats&quot; would be valid. But the Seralini wasn&#39;t arguing for the null hypothesis. If you have a small study that shows (statistically significant) <strong>harm</strong>, then great! You&#39;ve got your result and the study doesn&#39;t need to be any larger. The p-value is what counts.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more valid criticism is that Seralini&#39;s statistical analysis was not great.</p>

<ul>
<li>2</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strain that Séralini used is also used in long-term 2-year toxicity and carcinogenicity studies by industry and academic scientists.</p>

<p>The critics say that Séralini used too few rats of a strain prone to tumours, so the tumours seen may have occurred spontaneously and no conclusions can be drawn. But Séralini’s study was a chronic toxicity study, not a carcinogenicity study. <strong>The increase in tumour incidence was a surprise outcome. The logical response to the findings is not to dismiss them but to follow up with a full-scale carcinogenicity study on GM NK603 maize and Roundup.</strong></p>

<p>The Sprague-Dawley rat is an excellent human-equivalent model for predicting cancer in long-term (two-year) studies. It gets around the same number of tumours as humans do over its lifespan and as with humans, these increase with age. However, it must be remembered that Séralini’s study was not a carcinogenicity study, because of the relatively few numbers of rats per group</p>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<p>How often do studies provide their actual data? I agree this is frustrating, but this is par for the course in studies with lots of data.</p>

<ul>
<li>4</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>This criticism centres on the incorrect assumption that Séralini’s study is a carcinogenicity study, and concludes that it is poorly designed for this purpose. But Séralini’s study was not a carcinogenicity study, but a chronic toxicity study. Thus Séralini avoided over-interpreting the increase in tumour incidence observed and did not claim that NK603 maize or Roundup are carcinogenic in humans. Further studies must be carried out before such conclusions can be drawn. What is concluded is that NK603 maize and Roundup had serious toxic effects on rats, including kidney and liver damage, increased mortality, and the increased and earlier development of tumours, especially in female rats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might sound like a cop out, but I don&#39;t know. GMOs are not my area (I am in microbiology, as opposed to zoology, anatomy, or agricultural science).

<p>From what we see, though, the studies that we have don&#39;t show harm. At least the ones that followed protocol.</p>

<p>This study, again, unknown validity, claims that subsequent generations are smaller and fewer. </p>

<p>Epigenetic effects of GM maize feed</p>

<p>In the F3 generation of the multigeneration trial, DNA microarray analyses were performed on the lower small intestine. This identified 2 374 genes that were significantly abnormally expressed in GM fed compared with non GM fed mice; with 421 of these showing a 2-fold or greater change from controls. This was more than 3.2 percent of the total 13 034 genes expressed in the lower small intestine. The reproductive and other effects observed could be just the tip of the iceberg as far as the epigenetic changes are concerned. The impacts could take more generations of GM feeding to become fully manifest.</p>

<p>He cites only one source other than himself, and that one doesn&#39;t say what he claims it does. According to him, it indicates that contact with GMO corncob bedding made rats infertile. What the study actually says is that corn itself makes the rats infertile. The study never mentions GMOs once, and while it does raise concerns about the amount of corn in our diets, it does not support the idea that GM corn is worse than regular corn.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s extremely hasty to make claims about the truth <em>before</em> those claims have been vetted by others. Science isn&#39;t based on the idea that peer review is perfect (all scientists have a laundry list of complaints about the problems with peer review), but it <em>is</em> based partly on the idea that peer review is still better than a lack of peer review. The need for repeatability is paramount-- if one person writes a paper in which they publish some result, that&#39;s great, but it&#39;s not until multiple independent studies have been able to achieve the same result that it&#39;s given credence. Even the best-designed studies can potentially have &quot;unknown unknowns&quot;, so a single study is never taken as authoritative.</p>

<p>I think science differs from fundamentalism in a couple of important ways-- first of all, even the giants of science are not taken as the gospel truth. Many of them were outright wrong about many things-- Einstein gave us many important discoveries, especially relativity, but he fought against quantum mechanics, famously stating that &quot;God does not play dice&quot;. Which we now know to be false-- quantum effects are actually random. A modern PhD student studying general relativity probably understands it better than Einstein ever did because we&#39;ve made considerable advances since Einstein&#39;s work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science is constantly overturning past findings and learning new things, therefore we cannot give full credit to science. You know what I mean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science isn&#39;t so much about being right as it is about becoming less wrong. From an epistemological point of view, science isn&#39;t a way to achieve total correctness, but rather a way to come closer to the truth. It&#39;s about shrinking the error bars. Philosophically, science is a progressive enterprise insofar as it&#39;s based on a continual improvement of knowledge and the belief that we can better our understanding. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s also a conservative enterprise-- science in general is reluctant to abandon well-established theories, and for good reason. As an example, you may recall the brouhaha a couple years ago when some scientists working on a CERN project apparently found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly">neutrinos traveling faster than the speed of light</a>. Even the scientists who reported the result were extremely skeptical of it, because there was a century of scientific data which contradicted their result. They published largely in the hopes that the physics community would be able to find and point out their error. In the ensuing weeks, hundreds of papers were published with possible explanations, and the news media of course went into a frenzy about &quot;WAS EINSTEIN WRONG?&quot; For one thing, the media totally misread/misrepresented the tone of the CERN announcement, which was extremely cautious. For another, it wasn&#39;t a question of whether Einstein was wrong-- it was a question of whether the entire physics community was wrong.</p>

<p>Of course, it turned out that somewhere in the experiment a cable was plugged in the wrong way and there was a clock that was running too fast, so the results didn&#39;t actually disprove relativity. This is why scientists won&#39;t throw out a well-established theory on the basis of a single study. </p>

<p>On the other hand, scientists <em>will</em> accept new ideas if they&#39;re based on thorough and repeatable analysis. In the late 90s there were two teams (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-z_Supernova_Search_Team">High-Z Supernova Search</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_Cosmology_Project">Supernova Cosmology Project</a>) working on observing distant supernovae in order to figure out how much the Universe&#39;s expansion was slowing down. Based on the accepted Big Bang model, the universe should have rapidly expanded in the early universe and over time its expansion should be slowing down as the gravity of all that matter tries to hold everything together. So these two groups, working independently (and competing against each other) wind up publishing, within a month or two of each other in 1998, the same result: that the universe&#39;s expansion was <em>accelerating</em>, not slowing down. This implied that most of the energy in the universe was in some form of as-yet-unknown &quot;dark energy&quot; which was driving the expansion. Additional results, from the WMAP and Planck telescopes, and from many other sources, have backed up this result, and now virtually all cosmologists accept that there must be dark energy, and the leads of the two teams split a Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>Science is certainly discovering new things and overturning the old, but:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many old things are still very valid and very important to science, like conservation of energy, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, natural selection, relativity, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>While imperfect, science is the most reliable means of obtaining knowledge that we have.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Funding bias is certainly a problem, but my field (astrophysics) is, for the most part, far enough removed from hot-button political issues that I&#39;m not really familiar with the issue first-hand (and hardly even second-hand).</p>

<p>Research on cannabis is hampered primarily by the fact that the DEA still classifies it as Schedule I, meaning &quot;no recognized medical use&quot;. That has a massive chilling effect on even being allowed to do a study, much less get funding for it, even though (and this is mostly my personal perception) it seems like much of the medical community is more than willing to consider cannabis&#39; medical uses.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking to <em>understand</em> it, you&#39;ll be disappointed-- it&#39;s famously unintuitive, as <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys3220/phys3220_fa08/quotes.html">even many of its proponents</a> are fond of saying.</p>

<p>But yes, if you want to gain some understanding of how quantum mechanics operates, university courses are a good way to go. A PhD is a really involved process that you should only undertake if you&#39;re certain you want to do it. Upper-level undergrad courses can give you a good working knowledge of it.</p>

<p>On a layperson level, I&#39;d recommend, for example the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGRkPPFAotM">Feynman Lectures</a>. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics">Minute Physics</a> Youtube channel is also very good at giving quick, understandable summaries of physical concepts without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

<p>Anytime you hear someone seriously propound the phrase &quot;Electric Universe&quot;, you can be 100% sure that they are full of shit. It&#39;s a fringe group of people who mostly just have a hardon for Nikola Tesla and who completely ignore all of modern physics. There is as yet no evidence whatsoever that humans can alter the physical universe just by thinking about it (except insofar as our brains are physical objects, but they can only influence things via the known laws of physics). Telekinesis does not exist.</p>

<p>Radin isn&#39;t as far from reasonable science as some, but <a href="http://www.skepdic.com/essays/radin.html">his claims are still riddled with flaws</a>. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Dark energy is a phenomenon that we don&#39;t yet understand. However, when we do learn more about it, that won&#39;t change how already-known physical laws operate. It&#39;s like when Einstein discovered relativity: Newton&#39;s laws weren&#39;t thrown out the window. It was just modified for high velocities. For low velocities, Newton&#39;s laws continue to be just as valid as they always have been. Dark energy will no doubt involve a lot of exciting new physics, but any new theory will have to replicate the old. Special Relativity wouldn&#39;t work at all as a physical theory if it didn&#39;t reproduce Newton&#39;s laws in the low-velocity limit. A more complete theory of physics will still have to agree with modern quantum mechanics and relativity, because they&#39;re extraordinarily well supported experimentally (quantum electrodynamics has made predictions that are correct to better than a part in a billion).</p>

My approach towards school is not career driven, it is answering my own questions and trying to spend my time doing something productive and healthy.  Many of those questions are about math and physics.  I have been taking a math heavy, full time load and have a 4.0 after the first year.  </p>

<p>I do not openly reject psy phenomena, or electric universe people, I do not openly accept it either. I think the story about Tesla and Edison is about par for the course for capitalists.  I would also say that if Tesla was right about free energy, it is weird that no one has ripped him off yet.  I will learn as much as I am capable of learning about things and would say I will tell you in a few years when I get to the point I can actually look at the details and do the work of disproof or explanation.  Perhaps some of those theories are correct in some way shape or form, yet as unexplained as relativity before Einstein.   </p>

<p>I would punctuate this with, snake oil salesman are snake oil salesman and with or without electric universe ideas, there is no shortage of them.  We should question the large and powerful snake oil salesman, not be distracted by fringe groups.  What products are we spending massive amounts of money on that are scams against people?  To bring it full circle for artistic reasons not logical, for instance GMOs?   </p>

<p>Did you go to CU, or just a good link?  When I clear my mind and think about where I want to go to school, that school comes up more that any others.  Would it be a good place to learn these things later on in my education?  (ie, are the spirits pointing me in the right direction?) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read the paper and agree with point #1, a control group of 10 animals per sex is too small for statistical significance.</p>

<p>Regarding point 2, it seems like since they were studying cancer as caused by GMO/Roundup, they would want to pick mice that were bred to research cancer.</p>

<p>Regarding point 3, I think you&#39;ll find this is the case in most papers (not including the full data, which can often be megabytes of numbers and is not suitable for publication). You can usually e-mail the authors of the paper if you want the actual full data. I should add that I&#39;m a published author and have never once published the full data, as it would take 100&#39;s of pages if printed out, in a very small font. Statistical summaries/graphs are the best you can do given space constraints.</p>

<p>Point 4 - err, what? I&#39;ll provide a quote from the paper you linked to that directly contradicts your claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Up to 14 months, no animals in the control groups showed any
signs of tumors whilst 10–30% of treated females per group developed tumors, with the exception of one group (33% GMO + R). By
the beginning of the 24th month, 50–80% of female animals had
developed tumors in all treated groups, with up to 3 tumors per
animal, whereas only 30% of controls were affected. The R treatment groups showed the greatest rates of tumor incidence with
80% of animals affected with up to 3 tumors for one female, in each
group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should clarify for point 2 - they&#39;re bred to observe cancer after it happens. Not to determine likelihood of developing cancer in humans. We have other rats that better-match human cancer rates. </p>

<p>For 3, people asked. Organizations asked. Seralini didn&#39;t give out the data, and only released the studies to selected sources, which just strikes me as weird. Seralini et al. have not released any mechanism of action, which IS common in scientific studies, and is usually the main content of such a paper. </p>

<p>For point 4, look at the graphs on page 4. I made a mistake earlier, I meant to say R group, not GMO+R. Sometimes less rats died than the control, and sometimes more did. Looking at those tables alone, you tell me which is the worst experimental group. 9 of 10 male rats died on the control, and 3 of 10 female died. From this, it can be inferred that Roundup will save you from death if you&#39;re a male, but quickly kill females. </p>

<p>The paragraph you quote only looks at the females. Seralini looks at the data he&#39;s given selectively. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This blanket statement is untrue. Changing sample size changes power. A sufficiently large effect can be significant on extremely small sample sizes. A properly designed experiment with matched pairs can show certain strong effects (especially by looking at multiple factors rather than the probabilities merely of individual dimensions) with groups as small as 5 or 6, for instance.</p>

<p>For an example of a fascinating small-sample size study which has statistically significant effects, it&#39;s worth finding a copy of a PhD dissertation by the title of &quot;Drugs and Mysticism&quot; which had the conclusion that the drug studied (psilocybin or similar) induced a mystical experience under the circumstances of the experiment. The sample size in each group wasn&#39;t more than 20 as I recall, and it&#39;s very tightly crafted to show the significance of what is being measured.</p>

<p>Edit: Downvotes? You people are clinically retarded. I&#39;m always amazed at how bad people are at stats. Truly awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Right, but when you&#39;re using <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/hyped-gm-maize-study-faces-growing-scrutiny-1.11566">a breed of rat which usually dies of cancer within two years even when NOT fed GM foods</a>, you need a much much larger sample size than 10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, that&#39;s not true as a blanket statement. It depends on what you&#39;re trying to determine. If it were test of carcinogenicity, then I would be inclined to agree. My understanding is (not having finished the paper but only read some commentary on it) that this is explicitly <em>not</em> what they did but instead were looking for a cumulative-toxicity, for which the sample may have been less than perfect for proving <em>safety</em> (10 per group, 200 total), but as has been pointed out: weaker power doesn&#39;t mean that you <em>can&#39;t</em> find a significant result, it just means that the effect (probably) has to be larger to be significant.</p>

<p>Edit: And as was also pointed out in various other commentary, the studies &quot;proving safety&quot; (failing to show a toxic effect) were also done with 10 rats per group. So if we&#39;re going to make the absurd claim that no science can be done with groups of 10 for some magical reason, then we also must reject the studies which didn&#39;t show an effect, and re-do <em>all</em> the testing with larger sample sizes.</p>

<p>Then it comes down to a question a risk tolerance: in the absence of sufficient evidence one way or another, would you prefer to try a new creation and assume it&#39;s safe, or continue to use something that has been &quot;generally accepted as safe&quot; in the lay understanding of that phrase for literally thousands of years.</p>

<p>Attacking scientific findings based on speculation of &quot;bad study design&quot; or &quot;guilt by association&quot; is for the realm of politics, not of science. </p>

<p>I have seen many studies that were funded/supported by various pharmaceutical companies that were abruptly halted and &quot;buried&quot; because they were not producing results favorable to the benefactors. Unfortunately such data manipulation can result in the vetting of drugs or products that ultimately prove to do far more harm than good. Sometimes these products are eventually pulled, other times they are allowed to continue - but in either case, they can be <strong>very</strong> profitable in the interim.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you realize that you are treading on thin ice when you take a stand, and that the risks can be substantial, as the resources of those who you may find yourself opposing in the name of honest science are vast, and their conscience is quite literally <strong>con-science</strong>: To them, the bottom line <strong>is</strong> the bottom line, and they think nothing of crushing their detractors like bugs.</p>

<p>Sadly, there is no shortage of &quot;respectable scientists&quot; who will happily whore themselves out to these bastards for the sake of filthy lucre.</p>

<p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say I have &quot;no idea&quot; what I&#39;m talking about; my first comment was basically saying that even idealistic researchers (those with the best of intentions) sometimes don&#39;t want to rock the boat because threatening the stability of a journal can affect the stability of their fields, research, and jobs. My second comment was meant to make sure I clarified what kind of pub I work on. Chill.</p>

<p>And yeah, there is a big difference between med journals and CS ones, but it&#39;s a matter of scale and complexity. Money has influenced all scientific journals, in various ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the case with all scientific studies, you have to look at who is paying the bills. They are not going to pay for a study that is adverse to profits. They will do the study in their own labs, with their own people, or farm it out to a trusted lab. This is the same in most studies done, they are done by man, and man interprets the results. Sometimes the bad interpretation is found, but sadly most of the time the studies are just accepted.</p>

<p>With GMO it is even worse because the producers of the product own intellectual property rights. With the cost of the study being so high, few would anyone pay for another study especially when they will have such a hard time even getting the product they want to test. </p>

<p>So you are left with the study from the manufacturer as the lone voice of truth. And we are supposed to accept that profit did not affect that study at all. This company is completely moral and just, so they are telling us the whole truth. </p>

<p>Okay, so Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and these are known to produce tumors - so the study is bunk?</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Were there marked differences in the appearance of symptoms found among Roundup Rats as opposed to Control Rats, or not?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see:</p>

<p><strong>Quotes from the abstract</strong>: &quot;<em>Females developed large mammary tumors almost always more often than and before controls</em>&quot; ...  &quot;<em>In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5–5.5 times higher</em>&quot; ... &quot;<em>Marked and severe kidney nephropathies were also generally 1.3–2.3 greater</em>&quot; ... &quot;* Males presented 4 times more large palpable tumors than controls which occurred up to 600 days earlier*&quot; ...  </p>

<p>But because they used the &quot;wrong kind of rat&quot; all of these marked increases in disease, disorder and deaths in the Roundup Group vs the Control Group should be ignored?</p>

<p>If the Roundup has no detrimental effects, how do you explain the anomalies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well see, the problem lies in their statistical analysis. The experiment was set to run for 24 months (Table 2 in the original paper), however the 2 year survival rate of these rats is so low, and the rate of tumor accumulation so high that it cannot be made immediately clear what factors caused the deaths. In basic statistics, we can analyze the statistical significance of a deviation from the norm (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing">read more here</a>), and if this type of analysis if performed you will find that the differences are not statistically significant. </p>

<p>To put it into other terms, there is so much statistical &quot;noise&quot; attributed to the death and tumor rates of these mice that a deviation from a norm at the level detected cannot be seen. This holds even though there was a measured  6% increase of death in the GMO group.</p>

<p>Regardless, you should ask yourself, why wouldn&#39;t they choose a different rat species? It would seem like a simple way to increase the rigor of your study to choose more &quot;average&quot; rats, wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that, because these rats are naturally more inclined to have a short life-spans, and have naturally higher incidences of tumors, the results are bunk.</p>

<p>Okay, so let&#39;s say that a team of scientists wanted to study whether Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) might affects the development of breast cancer in women, these scientists should <strong>NOT</strong> review data collected from women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, as these women are known to be far more likely to carry either the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA"><strong>BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes</strong></a>, and therefor any data collected from this population would be worthless and should be tossed out, EVEN IF that data showed that HRT <strong>doubled</strong> the risk of breast cancer in these women?</p>

<p>Is that a valid analogy compatible to your logic?</p>

<p>Why or why not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the entire point. First of all, I highly suggest you look into a class or a book on statistics, it would clear things up immensely. Secondly, I don&#39;t know much of anything about the study you&#39;re referencing so bear that in mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this analogy is necessarily appropriate though, you need to specify if the sample contains <strong>only</strong> Ashkenazi Jews or a random sample that also contains some Ashkenazi Jews. Also is the sample large enough? This is a very important point, because in the rat study, the population <strong>wasn&#39;t</strong> large enough to begin with.</p>

<p>Regardless, my point was about statistical significance. You must measure the validity of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis">alternative hypothesis</a> against a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis">null hypothesis</a>. So when we challenge the null hypothesis, we gather data in some experiment or study, then we analyze this data and obtain information (p-values, means, etc.). This information can then be tested for statistical significance. We try to test whether or not our data is due to some deviation from the null hypothesis, random chance, or error by measuring the significance and seeing if we can be confident in refuting (or confirming) the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>So in the case of the rat study, the alternative hypothesis (Bt Corn caused more cancer) was not found to be statistically significant because it cannot be confidently said that that the change in mortality was due to the Bt corn or the increased cancer risk/chance/something unaccounted for.</p>

<p>In this breast cancer case, it is possible that a measured double cancer risk is not statistically significant or that it is. It all depends on the details really.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m just being honest because I&#39;ve repeatedly explained this to you and you still just don&#39;t get it, and some knowledge of the basics might just be important or necessary. If you knew enough about statistics we wouldn&#39;t be talking.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay so you&#39;re not referring to specific studies, you&#39;re speaking in general? You still aren&#39;t understanding this whole statistical significance thing.</p>

<p>When studying Ashkenazi Jews and the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, they have to measure the statistical significance of their findings just as in all other cases. In order for any such study to withstand scrutiny, they must show that the statistical significance of any information learned from the group is at an acceptable level. Using a large sample size, as well as picking a sample whose pop. proportion of cancer is not significantly larger helps. But furthermore, there are methods of correction that can help with generalizing the sample to a broader population. So basically, studies are performed on the BRCA genes in Ashkenazi Jews, and samples are selected and corrected for so that any discrepancies due to race no longer have a statistically significant effect when generalized to the whole population.</p>

<p>You will find that best, most solid studies and experiments use very strict, rigorous analysis. They plot statistical significance, confidence intervals, error bars, etc. And they correct for any possible &quot;noise&quot; or bias while going into great detail as to how and why. You find none of that in the rat study. They used a small population, they didn&#39;t perform standard statistical analysis, they didn&#39;t measure statistical significance, and they didn&#39;t correct for the unusually high cancer rates of the mice. The study is trash because at their core, their results tells us nothing useful, they only look like they do when framed the wrong way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, this is my first time posting here. As a disclaimer, I am neither pro-GMO or anti-GMO - I am pro-science. That said, one of the authors of the paper, Seralini, is a known anti-GMO researcher, whose work in last 15 years was focused only on Monsanto corn - and whose virtually all papers were discarded as being unscientific and with huge conflict of interest. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9ralini_affair">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Séralini_affair</a> here&#39;s a small summary, you can read more by just Googling Seralini. An interesting part in this study and in all others I read by him is that there is an acknowledgemnt section saying &quot;Greenpeace contributed to the start of the investigations by funding first statistical analyses in 2006, the results were then processed further and evaluated independently by the authors.&quot; (in other cases, it says that the whole study was funded by Greenpeace), immediately followed by &quot;The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.&quot; ! Now, you folks are really sensitive for even slightest sign of conspiracy everywhere - and you haven&#39;t noticed two following sentences, which contradict each other? </p>

<p>As far as scientific value of this paper is regarded, again you seem to dismiss any contraindication to your claims, even if they are reasonable for layman - like having a sample size of 10, even high school students should know such results are mediocre at best - and on the other hand, you claim governments dismiss your critique without addressing it - don&#39;t you think by censoring critique the same way you effectively create as totalitarian society as the one you would like to avoid? Also, claiming that the study is okay because 1000 redditors without any notable background read the study - and heavens, they agreed with it, because it generally agrees with their worldview - that&#39;s not how science works folks. Science works by consensus - and the current consensus is that the link between GMO and cancer is dubious at best. Studies like that, manufactured by Seralini and on Greenpeace&#39;s payroll will not help to change this consensus - it will only help to view anti-GMO protesters as crazy hippie youngsters, who don&#39;t care about scientific facts and dismiss everything as conspiracy.</p>

<p>INB4 he&#39;s on Monsanto payroll, I live in Europe in a country, where GMO is currently banned.</p>

<p>I think thats a big red flag if you ask me.  Many of the test monsanto funded scientists run, are only for a short period of time, like 3 months. and many times right after the 3 month mark is when the tests would start to heed results.  It is very clear it does not matter what issues there is with the GM product, the government is backing them all the way </p>

<p>I mean, you can read the text of the measure <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/933">here</a>.</p>

<p>The part that&#39;s been called the &quot;Monsanto Protection Act&quot; is section 735.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Sec. 735) Directs the Secretary, if a determination of non-regulated status under the Plant Protection Act has been invalidated, to authorize movement, introduction, continued cultivation, or commercialization for the interim period necessary for the Secretary to complete any required analyses or consultations related to the petition for non-regulated status.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>copy/paste from a GMO thread</p>

<p>I agree that inserting a gene randomly into the genome of a plant that does not already possess and express said gene can have unintended side effects. Let me expand with some examples.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways this can happen. The products of inserted genes can go on to interact with other genes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis">wikipedia</a>). Given the large number of genes in most organisms and the complexity of proteins, these interactions and their significance can be hard to predict.</p>

<p>Another reason that there can be unintended side effects is that disrupting a certain metabolic pathway can affect the production of other molecules that share the same pathway or are connected to it. To give an example, in humans, statins are prescribed to lower cholesterol. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA-reductase which is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol. However, this enzyme is also needed for the synthesis of coenzyme Q, which is vital for mitochondria. Statins thus have the unintended effect of reducing the synthesis of coenzyme Q. [On a side note, this can lead to symptoms like muscle pain which can be treated with supplemental coenzyme Q.]</p>

<p>In genetic modification of plants, scientists usually don&#39;t aim to inhibit enzymes. Rather, they might try to increase the synthesis of certain molecules by inserting the gene for an enzyme (perhaps with the goal of producing a pesticide, or granting the plant pesticide resistance). Nonetheless, increasing the synthesis of a certain molecule can divert resources from other shared or related metabolic pathways and affect the production of other molecules.</p>

<p>To give an example, a canola strain was genetically engineered to produce higher concentrations of carotenoids. An unexpected consequence of this genetic modification was that the production of fatty acids was also altered. This change may be harmless. But given what we know and are still learning about the effects of the fatty acid composition of foods on human health (think omega-3&#39;s vs omega-6&#39;s), this could have serious public health implications.</p>

<p>To give another example, in a series of transgenic experiments on potatoes, many of the transgenic lines were found to produce substances that were not found in the original potato - one of these substances could not even be identified. In order to assess the safety of these plants, it&#39;s important to be able to identify all the changes so that we can study their effects on humans. With proper analysis of the modified plant, and proper safety testing, GMOs that are safe for human consumption could theoretically be brought to market. The problem is that according to the idea of &quot;substantial equivalence&quot;, GMOs would not need to undergo the intensive testing needed to detect and assess the safety of these changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the six acadamies is concerned, what does that mean to you? Because it was confusing to me what it meant. Till I found this:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even without having read their statement, I have to draw the public’s attention to the fact that it did not engage any of these academies in their entirety. Indeed, a group of experts was convened in an emergency, we do not know by whom, no one knows how, with a total lack of transparency in the selection of its members, and on the basis of two representatives from each academy. These people have seen fit to write in a very short space of time an opinion highly critical of this study. They cannot claim to embody the opinion of the entire French scientific world, and it would be a crime to suggest that they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exerpt from AskScience topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to expand on that a little bit, because it&#39;s critically important. Every food crop GMO that I am aware of is transgenic; that is, the genes being inserted are not artificially created, they are instead taken from another plant (or animal) and inserted into the crop cultivar&#39;s genome. Examples include genes inserted into tomatoes to produce a protein that makes them resistant to frost damage and genes inserted into potatoes to make them toxic to their primary insect pest (the Colorado potato beetle).</p>

<p>The fact that it&#39;s transgenic is important because it means that, to some extent, the products of these genes are already vetted. We aren&#39;t creating entirely new genes (and subsequent proteins) out of thin air. The anti-freeze protein in the tomato was already safe to eat when it was in a flounder; it doesn&#39;t magically become toxic in a tomato (things like acidity can change protein folding dynamics and so it must be tested for safety again in the food system, which it was).</p>

<p>The case of the transgenic potato is especially sad. Here&#39;s an excerpt from a review paper regarding the fate of these potatoes:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Potatoes were among the first successful transgentic crop plants (An et al. 1986). Genetically modified potatoes expressing Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin that is toxic to the Colorado potato beetle were sold in the U.S. from 1995-2000. Although well-received at first, they were discontinued after only five years of use because of consumer concerns about genetically modified crops, grower concerns, and competition with a new and highly efficient insecticide imidacloprid (Grafius and Douches 2008).</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is this sad? Because the potato was fine. It successfully resisted the potato beetle and allowed the growers to stop pouring massive amounts of insecticides onto their fields. However, because of consumer mistrust and a host of fear-mongering by anti-GMO organizations, use of the potato was discontinued and farmers went back to using lots and lots of insecticide. This cognitive dissonance from environmentalists (which I consider myself to be) really frustrates me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem with people using science to refute conspiracies or scams, just so long as its backed up with peer reviewed data. If people are going to poopoo a study, their points better be valid, just like anything else.</p>

<p>I see way too many people who are willing to believe anything they hear without verifying it themselves on both sides of the fence. Many people in this sub are guilty of instantly believing anything negative that they&#39;ve heard about Monsanto without actually looking. This is no better than people who automatically support Monsanto or any other controversial subject.  How many of you are just going to say &quot;I knew it!&quot; and STILL not go look for yourselves? It&#39;s shameful shit.</p>

<p>You have not looked at the study then.  You are anti science because science is against the study.  This study is akin to a study basically saying people did not evolve they were created by god.

<p>Just so we can have a teaching moment here: &quot;Science&quot; is a method of inquiry.  That&#39;s it.  &quot;Science&quot; does not hold opinions.  Science is one of the tools by which we come to our opinions.  But &quot;Science&quot; can not decide anything or tell us how to think.</p>

<p>How about the part that the study contains no information that you say it does.  And how about the fact it was funded and peer reviewed by greenpeace, and greenpeace supporters who are notoriously anti gmo.</p>

<p>How about every other study not showing these results.  How about the control in this study being extremely low in tumors compared to historical controls.  How about the minuscule sample size.  How about the lack of any real science being done in the study? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silly question, but when it comes to crazy conspiracy theorists vs corporate shills, is it not possible that both people could be wrong?</p>

<p>What if the genetically modified food grain that was used in the study is only harmful in certain situations, like eating uncooked seeds vs processed and completed food product, rendering the data from the study invalid due to humans not ingesting GM food the same way a rat would?</p>

<p>I also haven&#39;t read the study involved, but when they show a statistic variance between the cancer rates or the GM-eating rats vs the control rats, just how much &#39;more likely&#39; was the one group to contract cancer? If it is a small variance, say 0.2% instead of 0.1%, that risk my be worth the added benefit to the use of such crops. If it is larger, like 1% vs 0.1%, then it might not be.</p>

<p>So, yes, maybe there is a higher cancer rate using Monsanto seeds, but is the cancer rate the only thing we should look at?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is our great cleansing.  Fortunately like most evils in America you can simply opt out if you are enlightened enough.  For many people this will be the ignorance that kills them and whoever is left will have come out the other end of the evolution gears worthy to pass their genes onward.  I think that on some level the elites are fine with this because they realize that the subcultures that are worthy will choose to continue living.</p>

<p>Try not to eat that food and tell others not to eat it either.  A lot of people are still going to die from it in the meantime and they may never have an idea even in the end.  Many of these people will blindly approve of wars, police-state surveillance and know nothing of politics, economics or spirituality.  We won&#39;t be missing them much.  However this whole GMO practice will need to be put down before it endangers humanity, and it will be put down.</p>

<p>Think of a Venn diagram of everyone on this issue. The circle of people worried about the health and environmental impact of GMO is larger and not concentric with the people worried about Monsanto. </p>

<p>I know many pro corporate conservatives that shop only organic and are concerned about the environment. But they think anti corporate corruption activists are &quot;looney&quot;. I&#39;m not one of those people,  but pro capitalist pro environmentalist types are an ally on this fight. </p>

<p>It seemed like a legit study. But the pro-GMO crowd were adamant that &quot;all scientists now agree that this study was a fraud.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The skeptics do this shit all the time.  Anytime a study comes out that challenges big money, it is immediately declared fraud and you will ALWAYS see the lead scientist take the direct hit for the fraud.  They do this for very specific reasons, so other scientists are unlikely to publish similar data in the future.  This was Andrew Wakefield&#39;s case to a T.  <strong>Every single parent</strong> of the 12 children he studied (when he found measles virus in their gut) wanted to testify on Wakefields behalf during his fraud hearing in the UK, but they were not even allowed in the building.  It wasn&#39;t about the truth, it was about a witch hunt and public show trial.  They needed to be able to call Wakefield a fraud so they could start off every legitimate discussion about vaccines with <em>&quot;Well, Wakefield is a fraud, so everything you&#39;re going to say is invalid.&quot;</em></p>

<p>If money and power doesn&#39;t like a study they just call it bad science.  The aggressive skeptics we run into online are just medico fanboys.  None of them doctors, some maybe students, but all naive tools.  To skeptics, it&#39;s not really about science or evidence.  It&#39;s about, above all else, being right and rubbing that in in the most hateful, arrogant way possible.  They are the perfect tool for a medical industry gone bad.</p>

<p>YUP.  The one thing that irritates me is that they&#39;ve claimed the proud mantle of &quot;Skeptic.&quot;    </p>

<p>Skeptics used to be against the church, which at that time was the source of unquestionable authority.  Now that authority comes from the *-Industrial complex, and is backed up by shit-tons of money and therefore &quot;science.&quot;     </p>

<p><strong>A true skeptic is skeptical of power.  That&#39;s the only real skepticism in this world.</strong>  Being skeptical in defense of the mainstream is actually reactionary, which is what most &quot;skeptics&quot; on reddit actually are.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the real skeptics are today simply called &quot;kooks,&quot; &quot;nuts,&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot;  It&#39;s part of this campaign by these &quot;skeptics&quot; to just use repeated ad hominem rather than actually engaging with anything.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that article says nothing of the sort. In fact it just claims six scientific academics dismiss the studies as non science. This statement is expounded on by saying the academics never come together in a joint effort like this. Pretty powerful stuff there I guess. But how does this work? I don&#39;t quite understand the wording or process. So I looked into it and here is a statement of one French academic members. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even without having read their statement, I have to draw the public’s attention to the fact that it did not engage any of these academies in their entirety. Indeed, a group of experts was convened in an emergency, we do not know by whom, no one knows how, with a total lack of transparency in the selection of its members, and on the basis of two representatives from each academy. These people have seen fit to write in a very short space of time an opinion highly critical of this study. They cannot claim to embody the opinion of the entire French scientific world, and it would be a crime to suggest that they do.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So to me, that suggests these guys were assembled for damage control. We are really fucking easily led idiots. </p>

<p>EDIT: stupid phone spellchecker. Not academics but academies. </p>

While looking I did however find <a href="http://gmoseralini.org/criticism-seralini-used-a-type-of-rat-naturally-prone-to-tumours/">this</a> criticism of people complaining about the rat breed.
Though this came to my attention &quot;<em>Monsanto and other manufacturers of glyphosate, the main chemical ingredient of Roundup herbicide, used the SD rat in their two-year carcinogenicity and multigenerational reproductive toxicity studies that form the basis of the EU authorization of glyphosate.</em>&quot;, I thought that Monsanto hadn&#39;t done any two year tests? people keep saying that they only did 3 month tests that wouldn&#39;t show shit.</p>

The truth is the basic right here, if people are dumb enough to poison themselves regardless the facts, as smokers do, let them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Monsanto&#39;s GM products are indeed poison, it&#39;s ok for a parent to continue serving it to their children as long as they KNOW they&#39;re poisoning them?</p>

<p>The government should mandate Monsanto and the like to publicly address their mislabeling and misdirection, but it&#39;s ok for that same government to provide a few million of their own soldiers with unethical means of consumption as long as they&#39;re aware it&#39;s potentially harmful? </p>

<p>We should look out for the benefit of mankind, animalkind, nature, and earth but continue ingesting dangerous products and allow the spreading of disastrous GM products into our ecosystem without a second thought all for the sake of pseudo-individualism and self-proclaimed freedom?</p>

<p>If we want to take them down, we should take them down. If (mostly) everyone here is convinced of the facts on Monsanto and especially their seedy past, why are we still sitting around and sharing optimistic protest pictures and defending posts to skeptics instead of fighting?</p>

<p>Surely liberty is dead if nothing real is done. Conspiracy theorists have fallen into the trap of evils they have proclaimed to uncover if all they do is talk. &quot;Uncovering&quot; Monsanto means nothing if we&#39;re all still sucking from the teet. </p>

<p>If the government won&#39;t oblige us, then it&#39;s time to oblige the will of every fallen man, woman, and child that truly faced the fact that liberty comes with a price. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure all those currently fighting back in Istanbul weren&#39;t content with sitting around saying &quot;as long as the dangers are known, we&#39;ll pacify ourselves with a government that acknowledges dangers but does nothing about them.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was growing up I was best friends with Monsanto&#39;s CEO, Grant&#39;s son.  Their family was extremely nice and growing up we really didn&#39;t know or understand what our parents did.  As we got older we started to understand Monsanto and, my friend even had some hard talks with his father.  My town, very very well off was a place where executives from major companies lived.  I feel although the company makes it choices and decisions, the children and wives/husbands of the workers really shouldn&#39;t be criticized.  Maybe not on this thread, but others I have read has wished ill will on their families and I don&#39;t feel as though that is morally right.

<p>This is a fucked up world.  Ain&#39;t no one with clean hands.  I don&#39;t go around criticizing workers for making a paycheck, let alone their wives and kids.

    <div class="md"><p>You did not read the critique.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) The study didn&#39;t have a control group. BUT: If you look at the raw data this is clearly not true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crit completely did not claim this.  What it claimed is that the breed of rat used was not appropriate for tests measuring carcinogenicity (cancer formations).  The reason: SD rats develop cancers at high rates and at high variability within a population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat#Use_in_research">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat#Use_in_research</a></p>

<p>A 1972 study compared neoplasms in “Sprague-Dawley” rats from 6 different commercial suppliers and found highly significant differences in the incidences of endocrine and mammary tumors. There were even significant variations in the incidences of adrenal medulla tumors among rats from the same source raised in different laboratories. All but 1 of the testicular tumors occurred in the rats from a single supplier. The researchers found that the incidence of tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats from different commercial sources varied as much from each other as from the other strains of rats. The authors of the study &quot;stressed the need for extreme caution in evaluation of carcinogenicity studies conducted at different laboratories and/or on rats from different sources.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>2) The data don&#39;t support the conclusion that GMOs cause tumors. BUT: Again, if you look at the data, this is not true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crit didn&#39;t actually claim this directly, either.  The actual claim was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, due to the high incidence of spontaneous cancer under the conditions of the study, any conclusion based on such a small group is basically impossible. According to OECD guidelines, at least 50 per sex and group would be needed, but this study only used 10 animals [per sample]. It is very limited for the reader to make own judgments and conclusions on the meaning of the study.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The original paper didn&#39;t have a large enough sample size for the test to have statistical power.  It then got popular play in the press - as anything that carries high percieved risk does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I am going to try to explain some of the criticism leveled at this study.  </p>

<p>*Firstly, the control group is very small.
To make any accurate comparison between the numbers of tumors and deaths in this study, you must have a comparable number control individuals and experimental individuals.  This is not the case in this study.  There is a control group of 10 males and 10 females, but 9 experimental groups of 10 males and 10 females.  Even if the GMO corn and the roundup had literally no effect and there were similar amounts of tumors and deaths, the authors of the story (who are known to be anti-GMO) could say that the experimental animals had 9 times the mortality rate.</p>

<p>*Second, these rats are known to develop tumors.  This type of rat is usually only studied for 90 days, because when they get old, they die of tumors.  If you look in Table 2 of the study, many of the control animals had pathological abnormalities.  For the 3 of the 6 most common defects, 5 of out of the 10 control animals had defects, and for Pituitary defects, 6 out of 10 of the control animals had defects.  Now, I am not going to try to say that the control group had more defects for every single group, but defects and tumors were found in all of the animals, not just the experimental animals.</p>

<p>*Thirdly, dosage effects are not seen in the animals.  In some of the experimental groups, the more gmo and roundup the animals ate, the longer they lived.  If gmo corn and roundup was damaging or toxic, the rats that ate the highest dosage should have died or had more complications than the rats that ate lower dosage.</p>

<p>This study was conducted too long and with rodents that are known to develop tumors.  It was conducted by scientists known to be anti-gmo.  They statistically cherry-picked data.</p>

<p>I think that GMO food should be studied.  However, shoving GMO corn down the throats of cancer-prone rats and waiting for them to die is not the way to do it.  </p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PLEASE READ THE STUDY!!!! As much as id love to agree, I too have a problem with the control. They grew 3 fields. </p>

<p>One with non GM corn</p>

<p>One with GM corn no Round-Up</p>

<p>One with GM Corn with Round-up used.</p>

<p>We can assume the non-GM corn would have died if Round-Up was used. So these controls are fine. However when feeding the rats, we have 7 different feeds (food).</p>

<p>the 3 below w/ AND w/o Rround-Up for a <em>TOTAL of 6</em></p>

<p>one is 11% GM corn and 89% filler</p>

<p>one is 22% GM corn and 78% filler</p>

<p>and one is 33% GM corn and 67% filler.</p>

<p>The issue is the 7th feed, the control, is made with 33% non-GM corn. Why do they not have multiple controls to also include 11% and 22% none GM-corn? </p>

<p>I know its a minor detail and the evidence anyway is pretty interesting but this one part of the study irked me. </p>

<h2>SOURCE BELOW, <em>Last Sentence</em>:</h2>

<h2>The varieties of maize used in this study were the R-tolerant NK603 (Monsanto Corp., USA), and its nearest isogenic non-transgenic control. These two types of maize were grown under similar normal conditions, in the same location, spaced at a sufficient distance to avoid cross-contamination. The genetic nature, as well as the purity of the GM seeds and harvested material, was confirmed by qPCR analysis of DNA samples. One field of NK603 was treated with R at 3 L ha−1 (WeatherMAX, 540 g/L of glyphosate, EPA Reg. 524-537), and another field of NK603 was not treated with R. Corns were harvested when the moisture content was less than 30% and were dried at a temperature below 30 °C. From these three cultivations of maize, laboratory rat chow was made based on the standard diet A04 (Safe, France). The dry rat feed was made to contain 11, 22 or 33% of GM maize, cultivated either with or without R, or 33% of the non-transgenic control line.</h2>

And it may even reduce the amount we need to eat meat, via growing of meat, and that will greatly reduce CO2 emissions and provide more land for crop growth.</p>

Only the final number is real, however many upvotes and downvotes we can see through res are in constant flux.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m advocating for 2 things:    </p>

<p>1) Better debate.  That means anyone can test the stuff.  The seeds can&#39;t be proprietary when it comes to research.  More independent testing is done before rolling them out wide scale.   </p>

<p>2) This bullshit about not labeling GMO needs to stop.  If it is a good product then labeling won&#39;t hurt it.  Give people information.  Arguing against labeling is evil in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is typical of people arguing for GMO.  You say a lot, but in the final analysis, you have said absolutely nothing.  If what I said about clinical trials is not true, prove it.  Not sure what talking heads you are referring to, but I came to these conclusions on my own based on common sense.  I actually worked for a vaccine company, so no fear of science here.  But I do know when you go personal, that&#39;s all that needs to be said, as it says you have nothing to say.  and lol, organic food is more likely to make people sick if not washed?  Duh.  That goes for anything, but this again says less than nothing.  Poof, begone.  You know not of what you speak.  </p>
