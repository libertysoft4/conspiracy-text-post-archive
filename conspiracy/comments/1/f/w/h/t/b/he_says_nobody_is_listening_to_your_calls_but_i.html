    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they all talk about how they haven&#39;t given <em>direct</em> access to the NSA.</p>

<p>If they meant that they hadn&#39;t given any access at all, they would have just said &quot;we haven&#39;t given any access to the NSA&quot;.</p>

<p>This whole &quot;direct&quot; thing is clear lawyer speak to cover their asses. They&#39;re obviously giving data to the NSA and are doing it in such a way so that they can technically classify it as &quot;indirect&quot; and therefore claim that &quot;we are not giving access directly to the NSA&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s such fucking bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I received a phone call to day, that at first sounded like a real person (telemarketer) but after saying hello the voice sounded funny. There was an unnatural pause waiting for a response. So I asked &quot;is this a real person?&quot; after another unnatural pause it responded with what sounded like a pre-recorded response. &quot;haha of course I&#39;m a real person&quot; so I tested it &quot;what time is it?&quot; after a longer pause It told me &quot;sorry I&#39;m not allowed to give out personal information.&quot; So if some scammer has the ability to apparently trick people into talking to machines believing they are real people, I can only imagine what the government has.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea what their specific criteria are, but it&#39;s logical to me that they would have some sort of patterns they&#39;re looking for before taking further action.

    <div class="md"><p>What? The thought is that there are any number of suspicious patterns they are looking for, and when one is found they implement further actions. It&#39;s the same principle behind various futuristic crime stopping systems in fictional works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  What do they define as suspicious?  How broad is their definition of &quot;suspicious&quot;?  Is there a limit, or immutable boundary, which they cannot cross?  My point is that the general population has no way to determine any of this.  The general population wasn&#39;t even supposed to know anything about what they are doing.  I find it difficult to see how anyone can blindly trust a group that has intentionally mislead or deceived them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I already established that I would have no idea what criteria they use. I&#39;m also not advocating blind trust, but rather expressing a theory based on logical thought and required logistics.
