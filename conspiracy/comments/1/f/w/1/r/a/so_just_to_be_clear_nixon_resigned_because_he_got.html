    <div class="md"><p>I still wonder what that letter was that Bush left on the desk for Obama. I wonder some days if it was a variation of the old &quot;write two letters&quot; gag or if it was the plan and the schedule he was to keep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I imagine that they put down something pretty abstract that perhaps only a president could possibly understand, and relate on that level. I would highly doubt any plan would ever actually be written down, because in reality, a room is only secure as the people securing it and nobody is omnipotent... So it&#39;s probably just good solid advice. Bush was a VERY intelligent guy. The dumb stutterer was a complete act... if you ever heard him actually debate or talk in candid after he was out of the office.. well, he&#39;s extremely sharp. The character was perfect and planned. More than likely it&#39;s somewhere between a gag and really good advice.</p>

He sort of had it pretty rough if you think about it because he had to dodge 911 while for Obama it is behind him and he doesn&#39;t have to say shit and he has a single pronged strategy of nobody goes to jail period so in effect while people might oppose him he doesn&#39;t seem to have mortal enemies like if he was actually cleaning house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To this should be added that the ultimate purpose behind the Watergate break-in was to ascertain whether or not the DNC had received copies of Johnson&#39;s report on the Nixon election team&#39;s &quot;gaming&quot; of the 1968 election by sabotaging the Paris Peace Accords. Much like Reagan&#39;s team in 1980, this action was not only arguably treasonous, it cost the lives of US. Servicemen and provided aid to enemies of the United States. The current &quot;scandal&quot; is only a continuation of policies enacted by the Patriot Act, and was spelled out pretty clearly a few years back to those who were paying attention to various news outlets and tech blogs.</p>

<p>None of the above obviates the fact that Obama is a center-right tool, and just another lame political operative IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He and everyone else involved committed treason against the country by undermining democracy. He should have been executed and failing to even punish him rather less dole out the ultimate punishment set precedent. He should have been locked away for life simply for saying &quot;when the president does it, it&#39;s not a crime&quot;. What horrible treason that line alone is. We have presidents, not kings, and they are beholdened to their citizens, not granted a divine right to rule. </p>

I trust myself to observe what I see and comment on it and ask the relevant questions for my position; I would absolutely NOT want power. Éminence grise is much more appealing.</p>

<p>And regardless, you&#39;re contradicting me when my ultimate statement was that the president is beholdened to the same laws as any citizen and isn&#39;t exempt as a king would be (divine right doesn&#39;t exist and our government allows such a basic observance to happen if people wish it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I don&#39;t agree with most of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on this.   The media has an agenda, and the left serves it better.  I&#39;m not saying Republicans never serve it, or don&#39;t at all... But the media, and the strings  that control them, favour Democrats way more.</p>

<p>See, both parties are the same, but the Republicans &quot;preach&quot; a different message (personal liberty and responsibility, suspicion of centralized authority, etc.)    Though he may be a hypocrite (and usually is), he is still saying these things.   That message is still getting out.   The media allows it to get out just enough, so that people make the connection in their brains (freedom, limited government, individual rights vs. group rights and patronage = Republican), and then, they make the conservative in question look stupid.   &quot;Binders full of women!&quot;  &quot;Ron Paul didn&#39;t support the Civil Rights Act of 1964!&quot;  </p>

<p>The Republican Party, by and large, is full of witless shills.   But the real movers and shakers in all of this are Democrats.   Since FDR, and even before, the Dems have been the party of state power.  </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s that media bump that won it for Obama, and his race.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised you think it&#39;s ideological at all. It&#39;s seems obvious that the establishment&#39;s goal is to serve the powerful regardless of ideology. They are pro big government, but also pro military and aggressively pro business and &quot;free market&quot; (when that means helping American big business).</p>

<p>Also, the personal liberty message is something that has been emphasized by conservatives in recent years - a great thing IMO. But where was it during the Bush years when conservatism seemed to be all about patriotism, national security and a militaristic response to terrorism? </p>

<p>Sure, we can blame establishment politicians for pushing those policies. But the Republican base overwhelmingly went along with them - Bush&#39;s approval was high among conservatives until late in his second term. Unlike Democrats, who up until now have complained about (but tolerated) Obama&#39;s overreach, the majority of conservatives actually advocated militaristic, big government policies like the invasion of Iraq and the Patriot Act. I&#39;m glad that the renewed interest in libertarianism has started to change peoples&#39; minds about these issues, but let&#39;s not rewrite history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So just to be clear:  Obama is to the FAR RIGHT of Nixon on every topic except gay issues.</p>

<p>Nixon used <a href="http://www.econreview.com/events/wageprice1971b.htm"><em>wage &amp; price controls</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">created the EPA</a>, started <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y5D27z1FKk">OSHA</a> for worker health &amp; safety, ended the draft, signed the SALT treaty with Russia, enacted clean water regulations, and even proposed national health care.</p>

<p>Nixon implemented the first national Affirmative Action programs, integrated schools, endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, illegally spied on the DNC and his &quot;enemies&quot;, poured money into social programs &amp; NASA (Nixon was president during the Apollo moon landings).</p>

<p>By comparison, Obama has adopted Bush&#39;s NSA wiretapping policies, 
adopted Bush&#39;s Middle East wars and expanded them, has begun secret wars everywhere from Yemen to Somalia to Uganda using drone strikes (Nixon announced his secret war in Cambodia, which led to the Kent State protests &amp; shootings).</p>

<p>Obama pushed to CUT Social Security, pushed for extension of Patriot Act, EXTENDED Bush&#39;s billionaire Tax Cuts, adopted Bush&#39;s CIA secret prisons &amp; rendition policies, caved in on the debt deal &amp; the public option &amp; big pharma demands, and much much more.</p>

<p>Obama cancelled the EPA&#39;s ozone rules, resulting in environmental rules even more radically destructive than George W. Bush&#39;s.  Obama has de-funded NASA programs.</p>

<p>Yet according to the Tea Party &amp; Rapepublicans, Obama is a Marxist who is turning the Pentagon pink &amp; overthrowing capitalism.</p>

<p>If Obama is a radical left-wing Marxist, then what was Nixon?</p>

<p>I absolutely do not support the current Republicans, but be aware that some right wingers incorrectly use the term &quot;Marxist&quot; when they mean &quot;statist&quot;. Obviously that criticism is laughable coming from Republicans, but now when coming from Libertarians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step back and absorb this: You know, the whole topic here should be the wiretapping.  From a conspiracy theorists standpoint, you are falling right into the same old tired rut they have tricked you into - playing the left vs right bs instead of looking at the real issue here - wiretapping citizens.  </p>

<p>You need a better tinfoil hat to block that stuff.  If you are really more concerned about how left or right a politician is than the actions of that politician, they have you.</p>

And you&#39;re in this smoky room, and this little film screen comes down … and a big guy with a cigar goes, &quot;Roll the film.&quot; And it&#39;s a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you&#39;ve never seen before … that looks suspiciously like it&#39;s from the grassy knoll.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, <em>we</em> are better than this, but it is too late. A Vast majority of people in this country..

These plans have been in motion for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>It is too late. They will continue to introduce in little pieces through the mainstream media their agenda, so that more and more people can swallow it up, and accept it as the norm.</p>

<p>Naturally there will be more dissent, but there will still be a <strong>Vast</strong> majority who Do Not Care what is happening around them, because their lives are too nice to want that to change. So when that dissent is snuffed out, it will be for the greater good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama and this Congress has to be backed by some power that has control over every avenue that can come after him. That would mean that the news media, the military, the Supreme Court and every state government is on the take. If this is true that means every election is a sham, every letter an petition to Congress is ignored and peaceful protest is hopeless. Look at the Lewinsky scandal, Whitewater and Watergate erupted over almost nothing and yet this regime is beyond scrutiny. It is obviously something bigger than fear of the race card being played. Our government has been taken over by some very big, very powerful group that seek to obfuscate the facts, divide and confuse the populous and undermine the Constitution. People need to get their heads out of their asses and realize what is going on.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets just agree this isn&#39;t a liberal/conservative, left/right Obama thing. </p>

<p>There were a lot of senators (all of them, according to mass media) that were in on the thing. This comes from both sides. It wasn&#39;t a red/blue thing. It is a corrupt government top-down thing, and it wouldn&#39;t be any different if a Republican was president. </p>

<p>This &quot;liberalbot&quot; stuff just brings down the community and makes us all look bad, and it interferes with getting anything done if we&#39;re all bickering about which side of the spectrum is worst. Corruption is widespread, not limited to liberals/conservatives. </p>

<p>most people expect a &#39;but&#39; after a sentence like that, but i generally understand where and what he comes from but im just not sure that the ends are going to justify the means on this one.</p>

<p>some part of me still thinks that hes going to come up on stage one day and say </p>

<p>&quot;ok guys- ive done everything i could to point out to all of you who your real enemies are... what are you waiting for?&quot;</p>

<p>and then starts setting up the guillotine Bane/Robespierre style.</p>

<p>incredibly good at what he does- but i honestly believe that if he were to step back and take an objective look at what is happening it would shake him to his core. </p>

Then you select what or who you would like to hear... like if wanted to listen to segue08 I just search his IP that i get after contacting reddit or hell maybe I bypass asking reddit altogether and just whatever and then I&#39;m in.  Then you do whatever you want... blackmail people, steal secrets, laugh at you naked pics (yeh they access to everything not just audio).  </p>
