<p>I mean I would care but Chicago would make people care WAY more.</p>

<p>Also, though in this imagined scenario it&#39;s a nuke that gets adverted, there would still be at least a traditional explosive that goes off or something else of that nature.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is that really all you&#39;re going to be?  Well, 1) get <em>real</em> ready to be super angry, because a LOT of innocents will likely get hurt by it if/when it happens (as a lot of innocents got hurt during all the many other false flag attacks that have taken place in this country), and 2) we really need to stop getting &quot;outraged&quot; at things like this and simply start to realize that this indeed is the horrible, dangerous, manipulative world we live in and start to build up the resolve to DO something about it and fight back.</p>

<p>Fun time&#39;s over, American boys and girls.  We are no longer live in the &quot;Land of the free.  Home of the brave.&quot;  Haven&#39;t in quite some time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to grow some balls and get ready to do some work or else simply get enslaved by the fast approaching totalitarian regime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>O yeah, they could stage a false flag terror attack and prevent it or even have a big false flag like a major bomb or a nuke going off to change the subject from the recent scandals like the IRS, AP and now the NSA major spying.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m expecting massive false flags that are either allowed or prevented, either way they think it will help them, but we have the truth on our side, we have the cameras, we have the leakers, we will get to the bottom and expose any possible future false flag operation and they are at their limits of how much operations they can stage, at certain point even the zombies will start catching on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BINGO! my ex employer had GPS locators for all company phones and software provided by the carrier to track every phone. even displays it on a lovely map. It wasnt used by our company to make our venture more efficient, but by the boss to spy on us. He knew who was hanging together at the bar on friday who was cheating on their wifes and any company relationships. he issued the company phone told everyone to use them as the regular phone keep them on them 24 /7... not to worry about making calls with them but please don&#39;t call China or long distance a lot.</p>

<p>I pulled my battery one day and after powering up he called me in seconds. He gave me some bs about seeing whos phone this was, yet the phone list was readily available. He had to hook up to get it back on the map. </p>

<p>my supervisor had informed me of this program and what the boss did with it. needless to say neither of us work there anymore.</p>

<p>more than being spied on, what pissed me off was that he didn&#39;t use it to make my job easier and more efficient.</p>

<p>I think the guy got his jollies watching us.</p>

Also, tragedy influences people more than &quot;we stopped a terror plot.&quot;  There is no concrete evidence that they stopped the plot, whereas there is definite evidence that a bomb went off in boston (for example).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A common critique of conspiracy theories in general is &quot;how do so many people keep a secret?&quot; How do we now it is not the case that the leaks are genuine from dissenters within the organizations? It seems that we are at a point where either case could be true, but in one case, the world is imagined with an organization of unlimited resources and means to carry out its nefarious plots, and on the other case, the world is imagined as being peopled by various organizations of humans with limited means and standard power structure divisions.</p>

<p>If I had to choose which world I want to perceive as being the &quot;real&quot; world, I will choose the second example until such time as I see a reason to think otherwise. Afterall, its more likely that an organization would spread rumors that the leaks were false in order to engender the perception of omnipotence and to invalidate the leaks.</p>
