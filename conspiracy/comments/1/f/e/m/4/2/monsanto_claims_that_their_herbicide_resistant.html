        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/agricultural-herbicides.aspx">Monsanto website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Roundup agricultural herbicides and other products are used to sustainably an effectively control weeds on the farm. Their use on Roundup Ready crops has allowed farmers to conserve fuel, reduce tillage and decrease the overall use of herbicides. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did this make you think... huh? Why would herbicide resistance decrease herbicide use? It means that farmers can spray MORE herbicide without any of the crops being killed! This was my thought process but I had come across a lot of resistance to it on Monsanto threads on the main page. </p>

<p>A quick google search led me to <a href="http://www.enveurope.com/content/24/1/24/abstract">this</a> research. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herbicide-resistant crop technology has led to a 239 million kilogram (527 million pound) increase in herbicide use in the United States between 1996 and 2011</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ultimate impact of GMOs is a 7% increase use of herbicide than what would have occurred without Roundup Ready crops. Not only are farmers spraying more herbicide because they can, they are spraying more because weeds are developing resistances to Roundup and more is needed.</p>

<p>This thread is not meant to be groundbreaking by any means but I figured it is important to call out Monsanto on their lies whenever possible.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That MIT wacko&#39;s claims, the vimeo and paper, have been thoroughly debunked over and over, but keeps getting reposted to Reddit in a new format. </p>

<p>In reality, the amount of RoundUp chemicals in the resulting crops have been thoroughly tested over and over for 20 years by many many studies. They fall within the tolerable FDA trace amounts comparable to other herbicides, many of which are much more toxic.</p>

<p>Non-GM plants die when exposed to RoundUp, because that&#39;s the point of using it. GM crops are immune to it, and although the thought of the plants sucking of this very very horrid and toxic chemical is scary, all assertions that they do this are utter bullshit, as of date.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Your MIT researcher is a computer scientist studying linguistics...</p>

<p>As I said, very very thoroughly debunked over and over again!!! A few examples:</p>

<p>He improperly handled the toxic herbicide. Just because it is very toxic and has strict handling rules, which in this case weren&#39;t labeled properly, doesn&#39;t mean this is present in dangerous amounts to the consumer product. I&#39;m worried and skeptical about this too, but these crops have been studied quite a bit for 20 years by many different parties. 20 years isn&#39;t great for this kind of new ground, but its a good start. Present amounts of trace herbicides in the final crops is easy to test and the EPA (who admittedly is in a position of constant Monsanto reach-around) measures these levels as acceptable, safe, and comparable to other herbicides.</p>

<p>The EU, for example, has invested more than €300 million in research on the biosafety of GMOs. Its recent report 1 states: “The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.” The World Health
Organization, the American Medical Association, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the British Royal Society, and every other respected organization that has examined the evidence has come to the same conclusion: consuming foods containing ingredients derived from GM crops is no riskier than consuming the same foods containing  ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques</p>

<p>I was pointing out that there are tons of studies that have been done on GM crops over the last 20+ years. </p>

<p>You link a lot to leaky gut issues, but you haven&#39;t tied it to GM crops/glyphosate.</p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t think GM crops and glyphosate are safe, but there is no compelling evidence, yet, to make a good argument. So far there is a compelling body of evidence showing things are safe. You can thank the political love boat with Monsanto for slowing the release of anything negative that is credible. 20 years isn&#39;t a long time with such political quick sand. The counter argument to that, is other countries are worried about this and are enabling constructive research. Time will bring assurity or maybe absurdity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;but you haven&#39;t tied it to GM crops/glyphosate&quot; </p>

<p>This is exactly what Seniff is doing. </p>

<p>Glyphosate has only been used extensively in agriculture for about 15 years. No wonder the adverse effects have not been properly established yet.</p>

<p>WHO&#39;s review of <strong>Glyphosate</strong> in 1994 cited 201 (out of 360) references as &quot;unpublished reports&quot;. The science used to approve it can hence not even be studied or evaluated.</p>

<p>Research for product approval is funded/controlled by the manufacturer, and obviously that has a focus on toxicology at the very minimum of requirements. True research of toxicological pathology can only be done by independent parties subject to open peer review processes.</p>

<p>Normal citizens don&#39;t need or care to wait for the science field to agree. Americans are the sickest and fattest among developed nations on the planet.  In the rest of the world we all know this, and you&#39;re used as the prime example of what NOT to do. </p>

So if one was to go with only official stances, they&#39;d call it Vitamin-RoundUp. We all know there is serious room for concern, starting with the formation of these official stances. One quote does strike me as disturbing and concerning, but seems to imply that there are set enforcement methods for residual glyphosate in the end product food:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Studies with a variety of plants indicate that uptake of glyphosate or AMPA from soil is limited. The material which is taken up is readily translocated throughout the plant and into its fruit. In animals, most glyphosate is eliminated in urine and feces. Enforcement methods are available to detect residues of glyphosate and AMPA in or on plant commodities, in water and in animal commodities. </p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>You call Seniff&#39;s work debunked when none of the posts you reference quotes even a single sentence from her research papers? </p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing but empty name-calling. </p>

<p>Here are her credentials: </p>

<p>Stephanie Seneff is a Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She received the B.S. degree in Biophysics in 1968, the M.S. and E.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering in 1980, and the Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1985, all from MIT. For over three decades, her research interests have always been at the intersection of biology and computation â€“ developing a computational model for the human auditory system, understanding human language so as to develop algorithms and systems for human computer interactions, as well as applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gene predictions. She has published over 170 refereed articles on these subjects, and has been invited to give keynote speeches at several international conferences. She has also supervised numerous Master&#39;s and PhD theses at MIT. In 2012, Dr. Seneff was elected Fellow of the International Speech and Communication Association (ISCA).</p>

<p>In recent years, Dr. Seneff has focused her research interests back towards biology. She is concentrating mainly on the relationship between nutrition and health. Since 2011, she has written 10 papers (7 as first author) in various medical and health-related journals on topics such as modern day diseases (e.g., Alzheimer, autism, cardiovascular diseases), analysis and search of databases of drug side effects using NLP techniques, and the impact of nutritional deficiencies and environmental toxins on human health. </p>

<p>Marijuana growers know this as a fact. Also another reason to buy organic if at all possible.

    <div class="md"><p>RoundUp is extremely effective, they don&#39;t need to spray more. They spray less. It is less toxic than many previous herbicides, and they don&#39;t need to use multiple kinds. It binds to the dirt or some shit so that its dangerously toxic to the environment impact is seriously reduced compared to others. </p>

<p>More herbicides are being used because farmers are pushing more crops in less-ideal environments. Also tilling and non herbicide techniques are costly, so effective herbicides finally make manual techniques less effective and too costly.</p>
