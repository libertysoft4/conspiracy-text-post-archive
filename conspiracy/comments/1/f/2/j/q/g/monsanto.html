Plus people don&#39;t understand the science of GM, so they listen to ignorant secondhand opinions from hippies who got their ideas from crystal skulls. The fact is we have been genetically modifying our food for thousands of years. Monsanto has made huge advances in food science, achieving crop yields of unprecedented size, and enables this food to get to your table at a cheap afforadable price.With global population expected to grow by 40 percent in the next few decades, agriculture will need to become more productive and more sustainable in order to keep pace with rapidly increasing demands. </p>

<li>Yes, you do not understand at all, we get it. I hope one day you will learn Genetically Modified, and Genetically Modified Organisms is apples to oranges. Genetically Modified could be skewed as cross pollination/crossbreeding hybrids. Genetically Modified Organisms is injecting a modified organism into the genetic makeup of a living organism. Then you have monsanto saying its all safe, we are trying to save the world BUT we need to make sure we write this bill that prevents any lawsuits against us when problems do start to arise.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Some do indeed have an irrational dislike of all GMs. But there are many of us who simply want GMs labeled so we can decide for ourselves if the modifications and ensuing safety trials meet our standards for consumability. As it is, trials periods are ludicrously short, like 60 days (how the fuck can you gauge long-term health consequences in 60 days? Any fool knows you can&#39;t) and they slap &#39;FDA approved&#39; on it without even really knowing what it might do to the human body. This is what the educated consumers among us have a problem with. I&#39;m happy to see people trying to improve the food supply and solve hunger problems, but I want to know that legitemate long-term studies have been done before I ingest that stuf, and I want it labeled so that I know to check up on the testing methods in the first place. I am not okay with being Monsanto&#39;s guinnea pig. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using GMs as an acronym for &#39;genetic modifications.&#39; GMO is a redundant phrase because <em>only</em> organisms have DNA, thus only organisms can be genetically modified. Plus, I was using the more generic term because many people seem to have an aversion to the entire science of geneticsm (the people saying &#39;don&#39;t mess with my food&#39; or &#39;stop GMOs&#39;), which I find a bit ludicrous. It&#39;s the labeling and testing we should be trying to affect. We have no business trying to shut down an entire branch of science. There&#39;s a panoply of helpful information coming from that field. People need to focus on specific issues, not sweeping generalizations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although i appreciate the simplicity in what you&#39;re trying to say, it is flawed and miss-leading... You act as though they are modifying food and and people are screaming leave my food alone... it is not that simple, they are taking an ORGANISM (who knows what it is) genetically modifying it THEN injecting it into the DNA of our food. this IS playing god in scientific terms and should be unacceptable on all accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you feel guilty every time you kill a piece of food, put it in your mouth, and grind it up into tiny bits for your own sustenance? Why not? That&#39;s a living organism that &#39;knows what it is,&#39; as you say. Why should a scientist experimenting with it for the sake of improving the food supply feel worse than you who are eating it as food?</p>

<p>By that logic, almost all of the science of genetics is playing god. But that argument will only work against fellow mystics, not empiricists. Scientists do not care that mystics think they are playing god (especially those of us who don&#39;t believe in god). Without the god aspect, scientists ARE just modifying food, and we see nothing wrong with that. It&#39;s the potentially adverse health affects that some of us see a problem with. The modifications NEED to be tested more thoroughly. Frankly, I don&#39;t see why GMO testing is any different than pharmaceutical testing, which can take 5-11 years to get approval. GMOs, on the other hand, have some loophole that allows for trial periods as short as 60, and any fool knows you can&#39;t gauge long-term health consequences in 60 days. THAT is a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to be a dick, but I think it was you who didn&#39;t understand what I was saying. I have indeed used the redundant acronym GMO before, myself. But I puposely used the term GM here because I was trying to indicate that people were being to broad in their condemnation of all things genetically modified. The term GMO is generally used to refer to genetically modified seeds/agricultural products, but during the rallies we had people with signs like &#39;Stop Playing God&#39; and &#39;Leave Nature Alone.&#39; This suggested to me that they would rather see scientists stop messing with genetics altogether (and your last statement about god leads me to believe that you are among them), and that simply is not going to happen. </p>

<p>If they wanted to accomplish something, they needed to focus on the testing and labeling, and the mis-uses of the patent system, not spew hatred about all things genetically modified (hence my use of the term GMs, rather than GMOs). Do you understand now why I used that acronym instead of the more cliche version? If not, then I can&#39;t help you. I&#39;ve explained it the best I know how. I&#39;m not sure why you think I would feel the need to win some personal battle with an anonymous stranger on the internet, but if that&#39;s your bag, you can have it. Have fun with that. You&#39;re welcome to your opinion, but I&#39;m going to continue to use the phraseology that I find appropriate to the discussion athand, and it&#39;s my opinion that GM <em>was</em> the right acronym to use there, not GMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly dont believe I was being too broad. I was refering to all genetic modifications because that&#39;s what was being refered to by many of the protestors and I wanted to indicate that the breadth of their condemnation was too great. I was being <em>exactly</em> as broad as they were, not more so. It&#39;s futile to condemn an entire field of science, especially one as large as genetics. People need to focus on what is traditionally understood by the acronym GMOs, but many of them are focused on GM in general. You clearly aren&#39;t reading my words before you dismiss them. Classic dogmatist. Like I said, if you need to feel correct, that&#39;s fine, but I stand by what I said, and you aren&#39;t going to use any logically fallacious arguments to get me to say differently. I&#39;m more thoroughly versed in debate tactics than you are, sir. Good luck elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just completely disregarded the legitemate reasons I explained for wanting adequate testing and labeling. There are actually valid reasons to be upset with some of what Monsanto is doing. They keep shortening the test periods requierd for FDA approval (now aided immensely by having a former Monsanto lobbyist as head of the FDA), they&#39;ve immunized themselves against lawsuits for negative health impacts from their GM plants, they&#39;re monopolizing the seed industry by financially cornering farmers into using seeds that do not reproduce more seeds, so that the farmers have to buy the patented seeds from Monsanto again every year, they&#39;re using known toxins in their weed killers and other pest controls, and they dump tons of money into the political process to stop consumers from getting the labeling that the overwhelming majority of us want. No crystal skulls there; just sound logic. That&#39;s not to say that everyone against GMs is <em>using</em> that sound logic, but it <em>is</em> there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t need to link anything about Monsanto&#39;s former lobbyist now being head of the FDA - that&#39;s a matter of public record, and you can easily look it up yourself. </p>

<p>The immunization from lawsuits is in section 735 of the &#39;Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act&#39; of 2013 (H.R. 933). You can also read that for yourself. </p>

<p>Details on how Monsanto financially pressures farmers into a position where they have to buy non-heirloom seeds so that Monsanto can have a monopoly on food production can be found in this new lawsuit where 5 MILION farmers are now suing Monsanto for bullying them with patent law - <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110330/04055413695/monsanto-sued-organic-farmers-who-dont-want-to-be-accused-patent-infringement.shtml">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110330/04055413695/monsanto-sued-organic-farmers-who-dont-want-to-be-accused-patent-infringement.shtml</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article about peer-reviewed evidence that Roundup contains harmful toxins - <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/325460">http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/325460</a>. But that &#39;old talking point&#39; that if you have to wear full-body protection to spray your crops with Monsanto&#39;s herbicides, they probably aren&#39;t good for you - is a damned good talking point, even without the scientific evidence. And of course the fact that Monsanto has been convicted of chemical poisoning with its pesticides - <a href="http://www.realfarmacy.com/monsanto-found-guilty-of-chemical-poisoning-in-landmark-case1/">http://www.realfarmacy.com/monsanto-found-guilty-of-chemical-poisoning-in-landmark-case1/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It buys Congressmen and Senators, which then ennact laws on behalf of Monsanto. That&#39;s how our electoral system works now (since the repeal of Glass-Steagall and the ennactment of Citizens United). Since 2009, when CU passed, the candidate who spends the most money on their election campaign wins the election 85-93% of the time, on both the state and federal level. Monsanto knows this, so rather than risk getting caught actually slipping money into the pockets of individual legislators, they just fund the whole legislation process, ensuring that their will be done when it comes time to pass laws like the Monsanto Protection Act. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically what you&#39;re saying is that <em>everyone</em> opposed to GMO food was unable to have a whip-round and put together more than a measly $260,000 to &quot;out-bribe&quot; Monsanto? Talk about being cheap!</p>

<p>$260,000 is chump change when it comes to the finances of a major government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think the numbers on the books are all the incentive that major corporations provide to legislators, then you&#39;d better never get into politics. Glass-Steagall was repealed, Citizens United ennacted, and campaign funding organizations like Super PACs were formed specifically so that people with lots of money could buy politicians without leaving a paper trail.</p>

<p>More than 60% of this country&#39;s money is concentrated in less than 5% of the populace, so no, the rest of us <em>cannot</em> outbid them. And now that money equals political speech, we cannot talk louder than them either. Wake up, brother. You seem to have a capable brain in that head, but it does no good if you don&#39;t dig up the pertinent information. </p>
