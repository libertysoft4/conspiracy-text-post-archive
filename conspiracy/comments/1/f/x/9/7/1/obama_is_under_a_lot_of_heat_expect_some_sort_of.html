    <div class="md"><p>They were speccing and building this stuff before Obama came into office.  Bush couldn&#39;t get away with as much because we weren&#39;t degenerated so far yet and the <em>liberal intellectuals</em> were strongly opposed to him and they simply stood down, closed their eyes and chanted <em>Hope</em> when Obama came around.  Its quite possible that the next president will be even worse because well, it will be the next president.  We might have a good president some day but likely there will be a nasty fucking crash first and the dollar will have lost its reserve status.  So if you are <em>young</em> then that is definitely in your timeline.  Its likely that your parents were young during one of the largest real estate booms in history and that most of their worldly aspirations were heavily tied to that bubble.  The game changed on you real quick and most older people don&#39;t understand that at all.  They are going to color the future with the past and I find it highly unlikely that it will be a good strategy for someone who still has 60+ years of life left to live.  America is going to crash hard and you need to make yourself globally competitive.  I just tried to take a Russian or Chinese language course while I&#39;m home in California from living abroad and these courses don&#39;t exist at my large university or very large junior college.  There were however, I kid not, eleven American sign language courses though.  Fuck.  I guess I should forget about trying to improve myself.</p>

<p>The law has turned into a straight jacket, there is no way to make the government obey the law without breaking the law.  The states or the people have to push back.</p>

<p>Something has to happen, they are clearly out of control.  Can the state goverments use the bill of rights to raid the NSA?</p>
