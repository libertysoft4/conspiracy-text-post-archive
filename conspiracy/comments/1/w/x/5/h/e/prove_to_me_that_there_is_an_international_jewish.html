How about that? Do banks and the Fed have any power whatsoever over government? What about Hollywood and the News? Do those organizations have any power/influence over the government?

    <div class="md"><p>Er, if &quot;The members don&#39;t necessarily have to be Jewish themselves,&quot; then whatever conspiracy it may be, it&#39;s no longer a Jewish one, by definition.</p>

<p>Now, I can certainly get behind the pernicious influence of big business on government - but everything I can see show that&#39;s far from uniquely, or even primarily, a Jewish issue. </p>

<p>As for Hollywood, take a look at, say, this weekend&#39;s box-office and tell me how it&#39;s the product of an international Jewish conspiracy:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people become racist against Jews, instead of looking at an organized Jewish Mafia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_mafia">(I know of one that exists that imports drugs into the US)</a> because they are told over and over that legitimate accusations against anything that is Jewish, like the Israeli government, is somehow racist, so they eventually just give in to being full on racists. After all, the Jews are usually the ones to overuse the word &quot;anti-semitic,&quot; aren&#39;t they? Eventually, one would get tired of hearing the same bullshit argument over and over and just fall into racism because you&#39;re already being accused of being racist. </p>

<p>Jews are brought up to be extremely educated, so an extremely educated mafia is not something to take lightly. It would be the same as (during the American Italian mafia days) being suspicious that 50 percent of public officials are Italian and have connections to the mob, but being accused of racism for pointing such a thing out. </p>

<p>This guy plead guilty to murder, extortion, importing drugs into the US, and was a major crime boss, yet he got only 6 years in jail (I know it says 10), and is spending the remainder of his time in Israel. Very strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take this black standup comedian in France. He has just been banned from entering Britain on the grounds that he is anti-Semitic. They say he hates Jews. I listened to his entire standup routine on YouTube, and there is nothing anti-Semitic in it. But, if this guy wasn&#39;t against Jews in the past, you can bet he has changed his tune and is against them today, after they have attacked him ceaselessly for months and slandered his good name internationally.</p>

<p>Another example, David Irving, the best-selling historical writer. He wasn&#39;t against Jews, but he wrote a book about Hitler in which he questioned some of the prevailing assumptions about Hitler&#39;s motives. The Jews began a campaign to destroy his career and his reputation and largely succeeded in doing both. Do you think he&#39;s anti-Semitic today? If he isn&#39;t, he&#39;s a fucking fool, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a fool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have the mistaken notion that a conspiracy requires a small number of men to meet in a smoke-filled back room to plot. Not so. When you have a small elite class, all with the same ethnic background, the same beliefs, the same goals, using the same methods, they don&#39;t need to get together and plot to conspire. They work together for what is considered their common good.</p>

<p>Jews have one thought foremost in their minds at all times: &quot;Is it good for the Jews.&quot; That takes precedence over ever other consideration. And since they all have more or less the same view about what is good for the Jews, they can all work to the same end without having to be ordered to do so by some mysterious, sinister leader.</p>

<p>Now, nobody would mind them each working for the collective &quot;good of the Jews&quot; if that did not usually entail harm for everyone else. The trouble is, the Jewish business model is predicated on the assumption that non-Jews are to be used, manipulated and exploited as cattle for the &quot;good of the Jews&quot;. And that is the international Jewish conspiracy. Jews work collectively for the &quot;good of the Jews&quot; to the harm of everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I ask you a question in return - how is it that we sound like brainwashed Nazi&#39;s? - ok ok, Ill give you /pol/ they definitely do have an element of brainwashed Nazi - but here, I just dont see it. </p>

<p>Most people here well tell you first and foremost, I dont hate jews, I hate zionism, and completely disagree with funding the state of Israel (or the israel first policy). Most people back up their arguments, like our friend internetpropagandist up there and I dont hear anyone going &quot;fucking kike hook nosed bastards&quot; or &quot;to the gas chambers with you&quot; or anything like what you hear on /pol/. Every once in a while youll hear a joke about the shekelmasters, but I dont think you can equate that to us sounding like brainwashed nazis.  Given the context of what we discuss here in regards to the money changers, its probably fitting. Its all about money and power in the end, and by their own words the Zionist Jews of Israel get the lions share of both.  </p>

<p>Its by statements like &quot;but honest to god you all sound like a bunch of brainwashed nazis&quot; that people get called shills or jidf and good goy. Its because of the ignorance of the statement and the knee jerk reaction to the idea that zionist israeli jews may not be the helpless little victims they pretend to be, that they wield tremendous influence and may not have the greatest intentions toward their American interests. Espouse this truth and you are immediately labeled as nazi. - wonder who would have an interest in making anyone with a valid point look like evil incarnate??</p>

<p>Im not going to try to convince you of shit, but what I will do is tell you to quit asking us to validate your beliefs for you... If you want to understand what is going on with Israel and the US do some research and come to your own conclusions. I did, and you can too. Yes, you may have to sift through some racist ideology - especially if you head over to /pol/ - in your research, but if you disagree with it, dont walk away with it, read through the comments, find the relevant articles, watch the videos, piece together the story and THEN come back here to discuss it without calling us Nazis. </p>

<p>Believe it or not, you can call out Israel on its bullshit without being a fascist jew hating thug. </p>

<p>Sure, you can absolutely call Israel out without being a fascist, Jew hating thug. But it&#39;s <em>also</em> what fascist, Jew hating thugs do. Combine that with a search of this subreddit for &quot;holocaust denial&quot;, and you&#39;ll begin to see yourselves as others see you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually its not, fascist jew hating thugs have no problem speaking their mind when it comes to their hate for the jews - all jews, however people who dont share that particular world view but certainly see a problem with Israeli zionism have to be very careful of what they say.... specifically because the rest of society has been BRAINWASHED to perceive ANY critical assessment of Israel as racism and nazi-ism.  </p>

<p>So far as I have seen, I have seen very little Holocaust denial on here. I have seen posts questioning the official story - but that is sort of what we do here - with everything - so its not that shocking or offensive, or at least it shouldnt be to someone genuinely interested in skepticism. The official story of the Holocaust does have a lot of holes.. much like any other major world altering event. So why shouldnt we question it? - it did alter our world after all.  </p>

<p>Point is, questioning it - questioning all official narratives about how our world has been shaped is we humans doing our due diligence! How are we supposed to guide our future if we dont even understand our past? If you want to choose to believe that the everything you were taught in school about the Holocaust was gospel, more power to you I guess, but I assure you, you arent doing yourself any good to ignore the fact that there is always more to the story. And you certainly shouldnt be running off at the mouth calling people braver than you to question official government narratives and openly discuss them, Nazis for their trouble. </p>

<p>The difference between you and I - and other skeptics (cuz Im being forced to assume you are either woefully ill informed, or jidf) Is that we dont give a fuck how you see us - we see you as willful sniveling slaves.  If that doesnt sound like you, then you need to prove it to yourself and step outside your comfort zone and give some of these alternative views of the Holocaust some serious thought. Most of us on here arent saying it didnt happen, were saying it didnt happen like you were told it did. but its all up to you if you want to think for yourself, or if you wanna take big brothers word for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats funny cuz not too long ago there was a post discussing the prior knowledge of Pearl Harbor, another talking about Unit 731, and another talking about project paperclip... and those are just a few off of the top of my head. Nice try JIDF but your logical fallacies and mental gymnastics aint gonna work. </p>

<p>Which state in particular are you talking about that is  &quot;far worse than israel?&quot; Id like to know exactly how bad you think israel is.. and then explain what makes these other states &quot;worse.&quot;</p>

<p>finally as for the holocaust, &quot;Iv seen nothing credible presented beyond quibbling over details&quot; - oh but you see, the devil is in the details. If your saying that it doesnt matter over the numbers killed then why do we even have to worry about it at all?? if the number is irrelevant then isnt the whole event?  a lie is a lie is a lie... if the claim is six million but the actual number is only one million (and Im not saying that is the case, Im positing a what if) then doesnt that cast the holocaust in a bit of a different light? - especially if the manner of death was not direct and deliberate.  If large numbers of those deaths were from disease and hunger caused directly by the war itself -(the blowing up of supplies and cut off of supply routes for instance) and not the sinister intentions of evil soul less goyim ~ then doesnt that also cast a different light on the events of the holocaust?  Certainly in terms of morality the holocaust was ugly - but war is ugly, and the victors are the ones that get to write the history books - so go ahead and buy into what youre sold, or make a fair trade and have a discussion about it. Its up to you. but dont try and pretend that you give a fuck about the truth because if you did even you would admit that the truth is always somewhere in the middle. </p>

<p>How many threads have there been claiming the Battle of Stalingrad didn&#39;t take place? Or quibbling over the precise number killed on D-Day? Let me help you: none at all. There have been two threads in the past <em>six months</em> mentioning, say, Unit 731 in the title. In just <strong>a few sample days</strong> of January after that, we have had:</p>

<p>A state worse than Israel? Plenty of &#39;em. Take a look at this map, for instance, which measure the countries where human rights are at the worst risk (seems like a thoroughly suitable measure of &quot;bad&quot; to me):</p>

<p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/World%20Human%20Rights%20Risk%20Index%202013.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/World%20Human%20Rights%20Risk%20Index%202013.pdf</a></p>

<p>Take your pick: <strong>anywhere red</strong> would be worse than Israel, including much of Africa and most of Asia. That you pretend ignorance of this, only proves that you look at the world through a funhouse mirror of distortion. </p>

<p>The bottom line regarding the Holocaust is that the Nazis made an entirely deliberate, incredibly well-documented effort (if nothing else, the Third Reich were excellent bureaucrats!) to exterminate the Jewish race. How far they succeeded, or whether the intended victims starved to death before they reached the death camps <em>doesn&#39;t matter</em>, except to their apologists and those who regard the Protocols of Zion as historically accurate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, yes you did.. you had your point proven by me screaming &quot;JEWISH SHILL!&quot; cept I didnt. I said &quot;nice try JIDF&quot; in a mocking sort of way after being called a nazi (appologist) by both you and OP. </p>

<p>So, on to the next order of business - ok, great, there are more posts about a Jewish conspiracy than the battle of stalingrad or the exact number killed on d-day... thing is, the argument isnt about did world war two happen - we all know it did.  You made the point that no one questions any other aspect of ww2 - certainly they do, you admit as much yourself.. now do they question the holocaust more - of course they do, and they should - its was a pivotal moment in world history, thanks to it, we have godwins law - so now whos trying to down play the holocaust??? </p>

<p>Ok and once again you said there are plenty of states worse than Israel (I dont necessarily disagree) yet you refuse to pick one, and tell me how its worse.  I dont pretend ignorance, nor do I look at the world through a fun house mirror.. I was asking your opinion on the matter, since you brought it up. I guess I shall have to settle for your half baked answer in saying that places at the most risk for human rights atrocities are suitably &quot;bad&quot; in your opinion.. well, lets not pretend israel doesnt have its dirty little secrets when it comes to human rights  abuses- but even so, I can think of worse things.. throwing your weight around and bullying other countries, killing their people, upsetting their sovereignty, covert ops and the like.. these things can be far worse in scope depending on how you look at it and who your talking about. But I digress... </p>

<p>You say that bottom line regarding the Holocaust, is that the nazis made and entirely deliberate, incredibly well-documented effort to exterminate the Jewish race - well right there lets just ignore that they werent particularly fond of blacks, gypsies, gays and other such undesireables up front, cuz of course Jews were the only REAL victims. </p>

<p>Lets also ignore the fact that the very evidence you site sometimes tells a different story. Im not saying that the Nazis didnt have death camps, or that they didnt deliberately kill people or experiment on them... Im just saying that maybe just maybe the real narrative of what occured has been embellished here and there and peppered through with a whole lot of gory fantasy so that the truth of the matter will forever be obscured and shrouded in a certain sense of dark reverent mystique as so no one is allowed to question what may or may not be true. </p>

<p>Furthermore, to sit here and pretend that the Jews are the only ones to ever be victims is pretty silly - Id say native americans have more to complain about if you really wanna get down to the nitty gritty of it. Its certainly more relevent to me as an american than what the germans did to the jews. I feel far worse for them. </p>

<p>And regarding the protocols of zion - perhaps they are a &quot;hoax&quot; as you claim - but lets not deny that very powerful jews sit round the table of the cfr, own the globalist banks, own globalist media, and set global policy. Because if you deny that then youre simply lying to yourself and everyone else.  </p>

<p>Lets also not forget that these wealthy powerful - and often outspoken families - were also able to buy their way out of the holocaust.  You can argue circles around it all you want but, fact is there is some shady shit going on with Israel.. there are even vast swaths of Jews - with a documented family history of being captive under the nazis - who agree with me that all is not what it seems. </p>

<p>So, go on and keep up your - you are a nazi sympathizer tirade, but you and I both know that the holocaust, bad as it was, was embellished - you admit as much in your argument about the flubbed numbers.. and as I said before a lie is a lie is a lie - if theyll tell you a white lie theyll tell you a grand lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience with this sub, a few months ago I thought there was some &quot;antisemitic&quot; sentiment, but that was based on my belief that if you say anything negative about &quot;Zionism&quot; that this automatically means a negative view of Jews in general, and I believe after getting to know this sub, that that is an ignorant view.</p>

<p>As for the comments your referring to, I have not noticed specifically comments like  &quot;Jewish shill&quot; or &quot;good goyim&quot; however that could be because I spend less time on Reddit than others, and I don&#39;t view <a href="/r/pol">/r/pol</a>. But I will say however that why can&#39;t it be interpreted as sarcasm the same way <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> does it?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1wqkq4/dont_you_hate_it_when_one_of_your_favorite/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1wqkq4/dont_you_hate_it_when_one_of_your_favorite/</a></p>

<p>And as for &quot;International Conspiracy&quot; I would ask define International, The United States &amp; Canada do fund Israel, who doesn&#39;t have a clear track record according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miko_Peled">Miko Peled,</a> the creation of Israel was in my opinion criminal, a conspiracy, not perpetrated by &quot;Jews&quot; but by Zionists, and continues to this day, and saying that is in my opinion not antisemitic. Do I focus more on Israel than I do on other Nations actions? No, Not at all, I simply notice there is more hostility when trying to discuss the topic than there is when trying to mention the violations of say North Korea.</p>

<p>Here is a video entailing Mr. Peled&#39;s stance on Israel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXAm-OylQQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXAm-OylQQ</a></p>

<p>Now there are also two things to remember here, Silent majority, and Vocal Minority, even if you do notice some comments, they should not speak for the majority, it is sad that if indeed such things are said on <a href="/r/pol">/r/pol</a> more often if indeed it is not sarcasm, but I find it equally sad that other forms of bigotry aren&#39;t key focus points, such as the fact that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> has <strong>TARD</strong> in the name, and often some refer to people in this sub as Tards, or comments about any other race/creed/sexual orientation or medical condition aren&#39;t treated as seriously.</p>

<p>All that said, I hope this answers your question and covers all angles, and hopefully you see people here are more willing to take you on in discussion about this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into the nature of the Bolsheviks and the October 1919 Revolution in Russia.  That was predominantly a Jewish movement, funded by Jewish bankers on Wall Street and the Rothschilds.  The total deaths of the Ukrainian genocide in the early 1930s is estimated to be from 2.4 to 7.5 million.  [0]</p>

<p>You have to look into it yourself and decide if that&#39;s true or not though.  No one can do it for you.</p>

<p>I spent a long time researching this issue, partly because it&#39;s recent enough that it is fairly well documented, but primarily because I realized if it was true, then you had to question just about all of our major historical narratives after 1919, especially World War II.</p>

<p>Certainly, in areas of government, business, and media there is rampant cronyism, and favoritism among the Jewish community. It&#39;s a cultural imperative, dictated in one of their chief religious texts: the Talmud. Conflating these specific examples to encompass the entire state of global affairs is a bit of a stretch, if not downright absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incoming rant (sorry). You would think a subject such as religion is worth looking into, when even the courts of cities, most of which are athiest due to the nature of their laws, usually have an oath under God... even if it is used just as a term to insinuate importance. Dont be so quick to discard billions of believers as hopeful fantasizers. Vaguely, their belief and faith is rooted in a very complex history of good vs evil. The subject of the creator aside, you will find it hard to trace most practicing laws to a source different than the laws ancient nations abided under the name of God and his numerous prophets. Believers tighten their faith through the phenomenon noticed in the history of religion: An interesting trail of revelations which have expired due to groups with an abnormal enmity towards the revelation. To end this comment off-key, these groups have succeeded over the last century, swapping God&#39;s laws with their own, this time uniting most of the world in their purpose and scam, dragging us to a really screwed up modern contortion of the pharaonic age (or roman age, you pick!)... If you havent done so, it cant be too hard to read through and research at the very least the entire bible and koran (My faith is ruled by the latter, but reading the two, and researching the islamic golden age, should spark <em>some</em> curiosity). </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> The change from the &quot;definitive proof that God never existed&quot; is already in effect, as the first world nations are athiest in nature, based on their laws, and they are warring other countries for reasons completely unrelated to a group of religious fanatics... </p>
