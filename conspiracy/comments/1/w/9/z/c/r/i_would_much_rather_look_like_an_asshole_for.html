<p>FUCK THIS. </p>

<p>So now I have this account to <em>really</em> speak my mind.</p>

<p>This site has so many shills and interest groups in it, along with people who still cater to the disney-version of reality. </p>

<p>Not to mention real life. Its not like you can tell your friends about your version of the world because you will be instantly labelled as a conspiracy theorist or seen as weird. I mean, most of it is pretty heavy stuff.</p>

<p>And then you have the masses which just sway in the direction the wind is blowing, a wind with a source, and a source with money, power, and influence.</p>

<p>I am going to shout out my opinions on this site now and I am sure to attract some shills, etc...</p>

<p>I used to avoid it. Now I welcome it. </p>

<p>They have soured my favorite site so FUCK THEM. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only using words. The pen is more powerful than the spear.</p>

<p>Some people on this subreddit have inspired me and I thank them. They are why I am writing this message in the box. </p>

If I was the government I wouldn&#39;t even propagate any conspiracies because you nutters are already going crazy and destroying yourselves. There is no consensus here, everyone thinks everyone else is a shill whilst maintaining that they know the &quot;truth.&quot; It is laughable to brainwash yourself into believing there is some grand malevolent puppet show controlling everything, and it&#39;s sure as hell a lot easier than actually making a difference. You know, starting a foundation to raise awareness, actually doing research or working to fund research, running for political office, anything. Your keyboard wars and mad assertions do nothing but discredit you and make a mockery of your paper thin theories. Good day! </p>

<p>Keep believing that. How dense are you to believe that a website with billions of page views per day is not full of advertising agents, PR people, and special interest groups?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wow. You know me so well, person on the internet who I have never met. Please, give me more insights into my life and my friendships. You must be really shitty at reading, because I specifically said that I do not tell the people around me all of the conspiracy theories that I happen to believe. But hey, don&#39;t let that get in the way of your bedtime story.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>My life is already interesting. I am traveling all around the world and having a great time with my great job. You don&#39;t seem to understand the purpose of this sub is to ask questions. </p>

<p>Since you are too dense to even acknowledge the existence of special interest groups on a major US media outlet, then I certainly don&#39;t expect you to be able to figure out the actual people who make up this sub apart from the ones posting to make it look bad.</p>

<p>I will give you a hint, the <em>actual</em> people who make up the framework of this sub are the ones asking questions. The right questions. But once again, you probably have a broken bullshit-detector, if you have one at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I was the government I wouldn&#39;t even propagate any conspiracies </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think the world is a cartoon? Do you think you can speak about &quot;the government&quot; that makes up thousands of people in power, and act as if they are deciding as a whole to be a certain way? </p>

<p>The rest of your post is just as idiotic as the first part. Do you understand the internet at all. You think that typing your opinions to millions of people is pointless as far as changing the world goes? And whether or not you chose to believe it, my life on the internet is just one small part of my life. Maybe you are projecting your own life onto other people because you are insecure.</p>

<p>Also, I have started a foundation and it was a tremendous success. It saved the lives of hundreds of children. And not figuratively. It <em>actually</em> saved their lives.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, your upvotes are coming from a vote-brigade: Proof: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1waivk/conspiratard_has_a_birthday_goes_from_12_to_13/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1waivk/conspiratard_has_a_birthday_goes_from_12_to_13/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt there are PR people and such on reddit. Those are what you consider shills? I was under the impression that &quot;shills&quot; referred to people spreading disinformation for the government, the &quot;illuminati&quot; or whatever.

You did really start a foundation (it&#39;s the internet, you wouldn&#39;t lie would you?) good for you! You took a step in the direction of actual progress instead of sitting here posting lizard man youtube videos. Asking questions is one thing, but what goes on in this sub is not so much asking questions as it is science fiction being passed off as fact. Lastly, I don&#39;t even know what vote brigading is, but I have no control over people agreeing with what I said or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you missed my point and or didn&#39;t bother reading that very short wikipedia link. My point being, shill is just a word used to describe PR people and pundits hired by US corporations and the US government to sway and manipulate public opinion. These people absolutely exist and they&#39;ve only become more prominent with the rise of the internet and grotesque overreach of power by both our government and capitalism. </p>

<p>Even from a completely objective view point. Advertising isn&#39;t effective and mostly ignored or not available (reddit), targeted PR/shilling is ultra effective, actionable and tremendously cheaper than traditional advertising. Source: i&#39;ve worked at Organics, AKQA and DRAFT FCB (top advertising agencies in SF) and even these design focused agencies would pay for PR services, they would even pay to have negative content/comments removed or hidden on trending content if it was bad for the client or brand. Also most agencies employ &quot;community managers&quot;. their job is obviously to manage social campaigns on FB/twitter/reddit/whatever but often times they&#39;re using services like this <a href="http://buyredditvotes.com/">http://buyredditvotes.com/</a> and some agencies even have software that can create hundreds of fake accounts on social networks with a single IP and single email address.</p>

<p>But i do agree that people have been tossing the word around way too much and it&#39;s rather silly to label people who don&#39;t agree with you as a shill. Obviously behavior like this only creates more division but you need to understand that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is attacked regularly so people jump to conclusions, i blame <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> for this.</p>

<p>I know it was a movie but that whole scene has stuck with me since I first saw it. Now you can bitch and moan post your comments and make a website but here is the truth fellow redditor.  Unless you get people behind you then you will be nothing more then a name on some watch list. </p>

<p>I myself have my own reasons for giving up. I dont see it making a bit of differance. The so called good guys spread disinformation just as bad as the other side to try and get others to join the cause of the day.

You have to remember that only your whackiest are posted there.  It helps me blow off steam and have a chuckle. Content there is like less scary <a href="/r/tumblrinaction">/r/tumblrinaction</a> content (and of a different flavor, too).  Sucks to see you guys being downvoted though; it&#39;s your sub, you should rule the content.</p>

Your sub is completely compromised in the fact of that everyone that is talking to him is getting downvoted. I am no expert on the way a downvote brigade works but this I am sure is a prime example. I was sure you left this sub because of shit like this.</p>

<p>Yet here you are again I really had hope that you would stick to your principals and disown these people but nope you had to come back. I am just dissapointed man very much so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why so many redditors from Calgary?  Methinks perhaps it has to do with the UofC, Mt. Royal University, SAIT, &amp; ACAD.  And maybe it&#39;s because Calgary has such a younger demographic.  And lastly it <em>might</em> be because of the oil &amp; gas company HQs here (though I doubt it).  Calgary is all in all, despite it&#39;s high property values &amp; mediocre public transportation system a great place to live.  And elboya does indeed look like a great neighborhood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say the demographic is likely a major factor. I notice there are so many young people there or moving there. It is still a boomtown. IDK about the unis, uofc is nice and SAIT is... well... SAIT. I think it is because of all the job opportunities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say we need active users doing independent research and compiling evidence OUTSIDE of this sub. Like we either need our own blogs or take some of the regular AWESOME contributors and have them organize a blog. We could track traffic more readily and not really rely on JUST reddit for our theorizing and the subsequent spamming. I would prefer a blog to a forum, like GLP, it&#39;s just too confusing to the &quot;everyman&quot; who might actually read a blog. </p>
