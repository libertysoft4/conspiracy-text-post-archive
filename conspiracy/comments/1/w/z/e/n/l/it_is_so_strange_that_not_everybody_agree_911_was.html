<p>The only way to make the Twin Towers collapse is by a controlled demolition. Which is possible only by having full access to the building, in order to plant the explosives inside the buildings. It is the most obvious kind of an inside job you can think of.</p>

<p>I wonder why this is not being used as the main proof. And why someone is still trying to deny it. It is normal information that is avaiable all over the internet. Every engineer is able to explain this, you don&#39;t have to be somebody exceptional to know this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of hard to go with the conspiracy thing since its been over a decade and no one has some real solid evidence that it was a inside job. No way something that huge with so many pieces that need to work together seamlessly, could be pulled off with not one person having solid evidence. I can get behind the government using this as a springboard for war, but its a bit hard to believe they planned and executed it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that in order for 9/11 to be an inside job, too many things would have to be done perfectly.  On the other hand if you truly study the facts of that day it is literally impossible to believe this was anything but an inside job.  Throughout history FAR more difficult things have been orchestrated by FAR smarter people than the general public.  Try founding microsoft or google.  Try starting a fortune 500 company.  The profit margins are the same ( I am giving a very broad example with this comparison) when going to war.  There are very powerful, smart people out there who can easily pull this off.  I honestly would love to agree that this was a terrorist attack but I have still not seen any concrete evidence that this was a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>a.  Numerous groups reported thermite in the remains. ( thermite can only be made in a lab)</p>

<p>b.  Numerous architects and engineers agree this was demolition.</p>

<p>c.  Witnesses believed it sounded like bombs went off in the basement (ironic because  that&#39;s how you would do a demolition of this sort)</p>

<p>D.  A large number of these &quot;witnesses&quot;  ended up mysteriously dying after 9/11.  Look into this one it&#39;s actually pretty interesting.</p>

<p>E.  You can see thermite along the outside of the building in numerous buildings.  ( if you look up thermite you will learn that it has a very unique color)</p>

<p>F.  A lot of people make a TON of money when they go to war.  ( not sure if this is the exact reason, but it makes sense)</p>

<p>It has been over a decade, but that does not change what happened that day.  People are still searching for an answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A little research into the whole thermite and thermate thing and you would see that the original claim of this was made by amateurs who really have no idea what they were talking about. In fact lawsuits have came against these people for reporting inaccurate scientific findings. &quot;far more difficult things have been orchestrated&quot; like what? Starting a company? I don&#39;t see the correlation. Your list of things just contains speculation. No real solid evidence not even in the slightest. I respect the opinions, but i seem to see the same key words in alot of this type of writing. &quot;mysteriously dying&quot; &quot;numerous&quot; Alot of times it sounds like you guys are trying to convince yourself more than anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude there are still operatives alive TODAY that have yet to reveal their clandestine missions as part of operation Gladio.</p>

<p>There are still weapons caches all over Europe that some super old dudes know about that are STILL KEEPING IT SECRET.</p>

<p>How is it far-fetched to believe that less than 100 people could orchestrate 9/11 in a manner that didn&#39;t implicate them?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like George Bush would have that hard of a time what with his brother running the security company for the airports that the planes were hijacked from.</p>

<p>Wonder how they were able to pull that one off, must of been so hard for the person in charge of the security tape to destroy that evidence...........</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to get peopel to shut their mouths when their involvement in the conspiracy gives them a massive financial windfall, and then on top of that if they do reveal it they&#39;ll be killed.</p>

<p>Money buys the &quot;patsy&quot; (person being used for their part in it like Larry Silverstein, he owns the buildings so you have to make him a part of it) and the threat of retaliation keeps the silence.</p>

<p>Not that hard, especially with 9/11, when you have the ability to just straight up make a fake company (because you have millions of dollars), and then hire them on a contract to come in during 2-6am to plant demolitions in a building.</p>

<p>Like honestly dude, there are LEGAL MERCENARY COMPANIES.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think people are also shitty enough to to illegal things for money? Like, the mob just doesn&#39;t exist right?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way people would do something that would slaughter thousands of people so that they can make money, that&#39;s never happened ever.............................................</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way the president could ever be assassinated and then the assassination be covered up, there are just TOO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED herp derp.................</p>

<p>Because we totally know who killed JFK...............................</p>

<p>How do you doubt it&#39;s possible for 9/11 to be an inside job when all history proves otherwise?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, it&#39;s like you completely disregard that a simple google search would reveal all of the DETAILED INFORMATION on what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>Look up Operation Gladio because now that the war is 70 years over and the people are about to die, some of them have come forward to reveal that they were indeed a part of Operation Gladio, of which there are official government documents proving.</p>

<p>Securacom is the company that Marvin P Bush was the CEO of during the 9/11 events, and they provided security for Dulles Airport, the world trade centers, and American Airlines. You can look all of that up and verify it is true.</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein was the owner of the WTC complex.</p>

<p>Blackwater is a legal mercenary company, excuse me, &quot;military contractor&quot; for the United States Government, and they have changed their name multiple times, it is now academi.</p>

<p>The Mafia is also an extremely well documented criminal organization.</p>

<p>You can prove every single thing that I have said here.</p>

<p>Fuck off with your lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all there is no way that a 9/11 operation as suggested by many conspiracy theorists could involve so few people. There would be literally thousands of people who could, at least in some way, expose details that would threaten the secrecy of the operation.</p>

<p>But beyond that it just doesn&#39;t make sense. In the 12 years since the event (and much longer if we include planning - 20+ years if we believe in the &quot;signalling&quot; theories) none of the people with actual specific knowledge about any part of the operation have come forward. None.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that hard, especially with 9/11, when you have the ability to just straight up make a fake company (because you have millions of dollars), and then hire them on a contract to come in during 2-6am to plant demolitions in a building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And any of the tens (hundreds?) of people involved in the actual planting of those explosives will have realised at about 9:10am of 11 Sep 2001 what they had been part of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like honestly dude, there are LEGAL MERCENARY COMPANIES.
You don&#39;t think people are also shitty enough to to illegal things for money? Like, the mob just doesn&#39;t exist right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would need to hire exclusively sociopaths to have any faith that they&#39;d be able to take part in a plot to kill thousands of innocent Americans and then keep the secret!</p>

<p>Could you hire some people to secretly rig a building to explode? Probably (although the actual practicalities of explosive demolition make that questionable). Obviously you aren&#39;t about to tell them that you&#39;re planning to kill thousands of people, so how to you know they&#39;re going to keep that secret once they realise what they&#39;ve been part of?</p>

<p>You base your logic on MOVIES?</p>

<p>Annie Hall, nonetheless, which was made by pedophile child molester director &quot;Woody Allen&quot; who is a known depraved sexual deviant.</p>

<p>Every single one of his movies is about sex in one way or another, most of them blatantly. If it&#39;s not directly about sex it&#39;s about &quot;love&quot;, or what this sick fuck thinks is love anyway, which is the most selfish way you could ever define love.</p>

<p>As for your support of the movie, what, you don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for them to make the bathroom attendant not be present there for that moment in time if they need be?</p>

<p>Also, as others have mentioned, it was a wartime effort and those involved had a unique sense of duty to country.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what a last name is?</p>

<p>In some cases, it&#39;s WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT IT TO BE.</p>

<p>Any gentile can legally change their last name to &quot;silverstein&quot; or &quot;goldberg&quot; or &quot;nagler&quot; or &quot;feinstein&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re actually Jewish.</p>

<p>Any person can claim to have native American heritage as well, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, especially if they can&#39;t prove it through legitimate documentation.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Stop making generic claims that &quot;Jews&quot; did it. Do you have any idea how insanely fucking stupid that sounds, to claim that something done by an individual of a group represents the agenda of the entire group?</p>

<p>Maybe one of the conspirators was Jewish, but who the fuck cares? That doesn&#39;t matter WHATSOEVER.</p>

<p>HUMANS ARE EVIL. Not just Jews, or Germans, or Russians, or Americans, or Iraqis, or Saudis, or blah blah blah fucking names for groups of HUMANS.</p>

<p>How about you look at who the current president was and what brother he had that ran which security company at which airport that the planes were hijacked from, the same airport which also had its&#39; security footage go missing.</p>

<p>The guy that owned the buildings wasn&#39;t the purportrator, just a low level co-conspirator who didn&#39;t really do anything besides allow their plan to unfold, which still implicates him in it but he&#39;s not the mastermind by any means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but even those things are proven wrong.  There are so many outside variables that are impossible to calculate.  Something as small as the weather added in or the amount of traffic on the street causing the slightest shift in weight on the streets can change the outcome.  That&#39;s why they never have guarantees.  You only come up with 1 in a million or 1 in a billion etc.  The problem is that that 1 could be the first time out of a billion or the billionth time out of a billion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the official story but I also don&#39;t think going to war hinged on the towers collapsing or not.  If the towers were simply crippled and 3000 people still died and the Pentagon was still attacked we would go to war anyways.   I don&#39;t buy into the whole &quot;the symbolism of watching the towers come down rallied America to war&quot; idea.  We were going either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The beams in a building are affected by the weight in the building as well as the movement on the ground around the building.  This is why you can never have a perfect computer model.  You can never calculate exactly how these variables will be at any given moment in time.  You just determine as many most likely scenarios you can.  Again, this is why you never get a 0% chance of something happening.  It is always 1 in X (you do agree to that don&#39;t you?).  We don&#39;t have a full understanding of every branch of physics so small things that we might think to overlook could have a large impact on determining an outcome.  It&#39;s like the butterfly effect.  A small uneventful change in the environment can have a large impact elsewhere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP is saying that &quot;these towers were built able to withstand jet impact and since they fell after being hit that is the end of the argument - had to be explosives.&quot;  I am just saying that even though these towers were said to be built in a way that the engineers thought would keep them standing even after a jet impact, there are unforeseen forces at work upon a collision that could cause the towers to fall.  The chance of them falling wasn&#39;t 0%, but slightly greater than 0%, making it not impossible.  </p>

<p>There may be a smaller conspiracy, however, involved in the actual construction of the towers.  Perhaps they weren&#39;t built to the specs that they were advertised as being built to.  Maybe some corners were cut to save on some money in the building process and to cut down on insurance costs by having the highest possible safety rating.  I think it is likely that the towers did actually fall from the impacts.  This doesn&#39;t mean I agree with the official story.  I think there were elements at work within our government ensuring that the targets were hit, but I don&#39;t think going to war hinged on the towers actually falling, so I don&#39;t see why they conspirators would risk being exposed by rigging these buildings with explosives.  That sort of effort would take days of work and man power.  It would be hard to pull off and unnecessary in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they only hit the buildings and didn&#39;t collapse it wouldn&#39;t be remembered as vividly as it is and wouldn&#39;t had such an impact on the population.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t say it&#39;s impossible that buildings couldn&#39;t come down from jet impacts, but in this case it is just out of the question. For me the biggest giveaway is the sudden symmetric collapse, in all 3 cases. The top part of the wtc 1 and 2 hardly leaned at all and after the upper parts were totally destroyed the rest of the building came down so nicely it&#39;s unbelievable. It would&#39;ve looked more plausible if the upper parts toppled over and fell to the ground and the buildings would&#39;ve been only partially destroyed, but no..</p>

<p>And you are right, if they were made with very narrow margins in calculations regarding the plane impacts then it could be possible. I doubt this is the case but cannot know of course.</p>

No idea how much computing power it needs to fairly accurately model the incident, but I guess in 30 years it will be doable on a personal computer of some sort.

<p>Haha, barely. The vast majority of the maths and modelling for the twin towers will have been done by hand. Computer Aided Design was a very new concept in the late 60s and would have been a minor part of the WTC&#39;s design at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it was a inside job, and if anything, the government is fueling the truth movement to distract people from its own incompetency, or even some kind of internal conspiracy fuckup similar to that seen with the 1993 bombing of the WTC. </p>

<p>I used to believe it was a inside job, back when my only knowledge of the event was from a few conspiracy sites, Loose Change, and Zietgiest. Then I started to dig into the conspiracy claims, and all I found were piles and piles of lies and misinformation. You even mention some of it in your post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is an obvious fact that the Twin Towers were designed specifically to be able to not collapse by an airplane collision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is that a obvious fact to you? have you ever researched it yourself? Because it is wrong in regards to 9/11. The towers were modeled to be capable of withstanding the impact of a 707, not a 767. This modeling was done back in the 1960&#39;s, which means that the calculations were mostly manual and vastly inferior to the methods available today. Also, the analysis was never released or documented, it was largely a claim made by the chief engineers who designed the towers, so there&#39;s no way to check how the analysis was done. Second, the engineer who did the analysis of a 707 impact (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson">Leslie E. Robertson</a>) on the WTC said this after the events of 9/11:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We had designed the project for the impact of the largest airplane of its time, the Boeing 707. The 
767 that actually hit the WTC was quite another matter again. First of all it was a bit heavier than 
the 707, not very much heavier, but a bit heavier. But mostly it was flying a lot faster. And the 
energy that it put into the building is proportional to its square of the velocity, as you double the 
velocity, four times the energy. Triple the velocity, eight times the energy and so forth. [Sic; 
actually triple velocity means nine times the kinetic energy.] </p>

<p>And then of course with the 707 to the best of my knowledge the fuel load was not considered in 
the design, and indeed I don&#39;t know how it could have been considered. <strong>But, and with the 767 the 
fuel load was enormous compared to that of the 707, it was a fully, fully fuelled airplane compared 
to the 707 which was a landing aircraft.</strong> Uh, just absolutely no comparison between the two.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/archive/leslie_robertson/index_textonly.shtml">[source]</a></p>

<p>So it was an analysis of a smaller aircraft, ignoring fuel, traveling much slower, <strong>and deemed incomparable by the person who did the analysis</strong>. </p>

<p>So the towers were not designed specifically to withstand the events of 9/11, claiming they were is misinformation. (interestingly, they did survive the impact, and were later brought down by fires in addition to the damage from the planes).</p>

<p>First of all, did you even read/comprehend my post? I provided a specific example with what OP based his argument on. You still want more? sure. You mention &quot;there was no plane debris in sight&quot; There were plenty of plane debris, documented by both first responders and photographic evidence. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general32/phot.htm">http://www.rense.com/general32/phot.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/assets/images/rb211a.jpg">http://www.911myths.com/assets/images/rb211a.jpg</a></p>

<p>So &quot;there was no plane debris in sight&quot; is clearly misinformation, and even a straight out lie by anyone claiming to have researched the attacks. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m playing word games? I provided a quote from the person who did the study that claimed they were &quot;built to withstand a 707&quot;. Did you even read it? The person who lead that study says there is no comparison between the 707 they modeled and what happened on 9/11. If you are incapable of incorporating such a legitimate source of information into your beliefs, you are only lying to yourself.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>its exhausting trying to make people see common sense</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m laughing at this, since i&#39;ve demonstrated with solid evidence that at least two of the claims you support are false, yet i&#39;m the one with no &#39;common sense&#39;. </p>

<p>As for building 7, I do not want to open that can of worms. Conspiracy theorists rely solely on conjecture to support that section of the theory, claiming &quot;it shouldn&#39;t have collapsed, therefore explosives&quot;.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ll direct you to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/911guide/drg_nist_review_2_1.pdf">this PDF</a> if you are interested in learning about more of the misinformation present in the truth movement. The guy is a research scientist, and spends over 300 pages reviewing the claims of Dr. Griffins conspiracy rebuttal book <em>Debunking 9/11 Debunking</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what i&#39;ve found, it was a myth/tall tale.</p>

<p>&quot;The shipbuilders Harland and Wolff insist that the Titanic was never advertised as an unsinkable ship. They claim that the &#39;unsinkable&#39; myth was the result of people&#39;s interpretations of articles in the Irish News and the Shipbuilder magazine. They also claim that the myth grew after the disaster.</p>

<p>Yet, when the New York office of the White Star Line was informed that Titanic was in trouble, White Star Line Vice President P.A.S. Franklin announced &quot; We place absolute confidence in the Titanic. We believe the boat is unsinkable.&quot; By the time Franklin spoke those words Titanic was at the bottom of the ocean. It would seem that the White Star Line President was also influenced by the &#39;myth&#39;.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This article was written by Leslie Robertson, lead structural engineer of the WTC during construction, shortly after 9/11 (Spring 2002)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/EngineeringandHomelandSecurity/ReflectionsontheWorldTradeCenter.aspx">Reflections on the World Trade Center</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner, the Boeing 707. It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark. </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The buildings survived the impact of the Boeing 767 aircraft, an impact very much greater than had been contemplated in our design (a slow-flying Boeing 707 lost in the fog and seeking a landing field). Therefore, the robustness of the towers was exemplary. At the same time, the fires raging in the inner reaches of the buildings undermined their strength. In time, the unimaginable happened . . . wounded by the impact of the aircraft and bleeding from the fires, both of the towers of the World Trade Center collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom watched it happening on the news and commented how all the officials seemed false, she said it looked like a play when George Bush came onto the scene. I wasn&#39;t really old enough to know what was happening so I can&#39;t vouch for what she said but looking at the evidence has convinced me of the truth and I will stand by it when someone tries to convince me otherwise.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Pentagon getting hit an hour after the attack</p></li>
<li><p>WTC 7?!</p></li>

<p>A few of the things that changed my mind. The only reason I hadn&#39;t thought it was an inside job was because I wasn&#39;t truly aware of it as it was happening and took the facts my school gave me at face value. As soon as I really looked at it and paid attention, I realized it wasn&#39;t as it seemed. </p>

A person could say that the majority of posters in here can&#39;t handle the idea that the world is a fucked up place where random acts of extreme violence, like 9/11 or the boston bombing or sandy hook shootings, happen. That the idea frightens them so much that they think it had to be orchestrated, that there needs to be a grand plan.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it&#39;s a valid point to flip this around, but I personally would love for any of those events to just be &quot;fucked up crazy shit&quot;.  That would be more comforting to me.  </p>

<p>What is un-comforting is that in each case, there are always these loose ends that don&#39;t tie nicely to the story.  All I want is a logical explanation for each loose end, so that I can agree with the official story.</p>

<p>So its frustrating, when you question the official story, and get pushed off as a &quot;conspira-tard&quot;, when all you are really trying to do is confirm the official story as credible.  I also don&#39;t want to be hushed, when I want more evidence, or confirmation of understanding.</p>

<p>At some point, the official story may lose credibility, and then its time for a &quot;re-write&quot;.  Documenting history though, doesn&#39;t seem to like to follow the scientific process.  There is too much political pressure to ensure the first draft is correct.  Political careers often depend on it.</p>

<p>We were so quick to find someone to blame for 911, we never really took the time to review everything.  Maybe the Israelis hood-winked us, maybe they didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t fucking know, but I&#39;d like to know we looked at all the possibilities before we decided on going after Saddam Hussein. (Who&#39;s not Al Qaeda and didn&#39;t have WMD)</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t look back at this and say, &quot;what the fuck happened here&quot;, then I feel like you aren&#39;t making much an effort to look at reality.</p>

This is why you can never have a perfect computer model.  You can never calculate exactly how these variables will be at any given moment in time.  You just determine as many most likely scenarios you can.  Again, this is why you never get a 0% chance of something happening.  It is always 1 in X (you do agree to that don&#39;t you?).  We don&#39;t have a full understanding of every branch of physics so small things that we might think to overlook could have a large impact on determining an outcome.  It&#39;s like the butterfly effect.  A small uneventful change in the environment can have a large impact elsewhere.  </p>

<p>In some cases, it&#39;s WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT IT TO BE.</p>

<p>Any gentile can legally change their last name to &quot;silverstein&quot; or &quot;goldberg&quot; or &quot;nagler&quot; or &quot;feinstein&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re actually Jewish.</p>

<p>Any person can claim to have native American heritage as well, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, especially if they can&#39;t prove it through legitimate documentation.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Stop making generic claims that &quot;Jews&quot; did it. Do you have any idea how insanely fucking stupid that sounds, to claim that something done by an individual of a group represents the agenda of the entire group?</p>

<p>Maybe one of the conspirators was Jewish, but who the fuck cares? That doesn&#39;t matter WHATSOEVER.</p>

<p>HUMANS ARE EVIL. Not just Jews, or Germans, or Russians, or Americans, or Iraqis, or Saudis, or blah blah blah fucking names for groups of HUMANS.</p>

<p>How about you look at who the current president was and what brother he had that ran which security company at which airport that the planes were hijacked from, the same airport which also had its&#39; security footage go missing.</p>

<p>The guy that owned the buildings wasn&#39;t the purportrator, just a low level co-conspirator who didn&#39;t really do anything besides allow their plan to unfold, which still implicates him in it but he&#39;s not the mastermind by any means.</p>
