<p>To all the champions of more government and more regulation: this is yet more evidence that your attempt to control people does nothing more than result in the very thing you&#39;re trying to prevent.  To the average person, it is an &quot;intuitive truth&quot; that letting kids run wild results in &quot;anarchy&quot; and strong kids beating smaller kids for fun.  But that sociopathy results from an incessant need by people to control others.</p>

<p>To kids, school is their metaphor for government.  And spending time in this prison-level regulated facility does nothing but prevent their ability to socially develop.</p>

<p>Want to make college affordable for everyone?  College prices soar to unheard of cost.</p>

<p>Want to make housing loans available to everyone?  Housing bubble pops and leaves people homeless.</p>

<p>And lets not forget about the other example highlighted by <a href="http://equalitystreets.com">Equality Streets</a>.  We need traffic control, right?  Otherwise, people would die in firey mountains of cars and trucks.  Cars would plow people over by the dozens on sidewalks.  Again, it would be &quot;anarchy&quot;.</p>

<p>But once again, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0RaSIJZhoc&amp;html5=1&amp;t=23m14s">we find that not to be the case</a>.  Not only does traffic move more smoothly, but road rage plummets.</p>

<p>tl;dr - If you are a regulatory champion (as we&#39;ve seen with all the communism and socialism spam as of late), just remember that your attempt to control a system does nothing but create the very problem you are trying to prevent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense. The more a social gradient/hierarchy is enforced and valued (some people being &quot;better&quot; than others), the more people will strive to climb that hierarchy. And an easy way to prove you&#39;re more powerful than someone else is to bully them. Makes perfect sense. </p>

<p>This is actually an example of deregulation fucking things up.  You seem to be trying to prove that removing regulations is a good thing so that seems to be a contradiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be very careful on extrapolating one study on children to government in general. I absolutely agree that this type of thing can apply to thing like the War on Drugs/Terror/Etc.</p>

<p>However, do you think things like banking and oil drilling function in the best interest of people without some form of regulation? History has proven this not the case. BUT, it doesn&#39;t seem like laws and regulations that have been enacted thus far have proven overly effective either. So where does that leave us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point.</p>

<p>One thing I didn&#39;t mention that I think is important is that quick and massive disruptions to any system are a bad idea.  Even in the case of the removal of traffic controls, it started small, then slowly grew.  But if you went and removed all signs and laws overnight, people would not be prepared, causing the nightmare scenario that those who champion heavy regulation call for.</p>

<p>If I could wave a magic wand to accomplish this, I would start with the bottom up and slowly remove regulations one piece at a time.  The regulations involving corporations would be towards the end.</p>

<p>While I can&#39;t simulate a society that&#39;s not existed before, my thought is that relieving the regulations on the people would empower them, and in turn, ween power from the corporations.  By the time it corporate regulations come up for review, I think the world would be a very different place, <em>possibly</em> even making such regulations nonsensical.</p>

<p>But that is where, again, the world becomes something far removed from our present day reality.</p>

<p>tl;dr - I think starting with the regulations on individuals is where regulation-lifting should start.  Review of regulations on larger entities would come after these changes have taken hold.</p>

<p>EDIT: One other thing that I mentioned that I think is key: have laws reflect what corporations really are.  That is <em>property</em> of people rather than people.  This makes those who own and run these companies directly responsible for their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with making the corporation the property of people. This would ensure that those that are higher up and control the actions of the corporation are held liable. No more &quot;I had no idea this was happening!&quot; bull. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need certain laws, because it is empirical that people understand that these things which we legislate against are not acceptable, like murder and rape.</p>

<p>I think it is absolutely ok to say you can not do these things as they violate another humans rights, and you will be punished for it.</p>

<p>We also need certain regulations to ensure that we aren&#39;t allowing people to be poisoned en mass by businesses.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don&#39;t think we should pass legislation saying citizens can&#39;t do things that businesses can&#39;t, such as making and using lead paint, but anything that would be considered as facilitating the purposes of a business would fall under those business regulations.</p>

<p>This does not have to lead to corruption because people who are truly doing things as citizens honestly have nothing to hide, and hear me out on why.</p>

<p>The government knows who owns machine guns. They&#39;ve always had the ability and they always will.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t own one, but if I did I would not care if they know because this is 2014 and unless you&#39;re never around a smartphone or computer with a webcam/mic (computer or xbox or whatever) or cctv with audio or bus or any other place you can be spied on, they will find out. Unless you have some kind of super fortress with a Faraday cage and reinforced concrete and lead walls.......or a nonchalant shed painted with lead paint and interior Faraday shielded, even though unless you had access to it completely hidden and didn&#39;t reveal its&#39; construction, they could most definitely find out about it through satellite imagery and other methods of radio-frequency monitoring.  </p>

<p>Now an intelligent and trusting society should be okay with adhering to restrictions that regulate business, while at the same time not interfering with citizen rights.</p>

<p>For instance, the government regulates marijuana business laws.</p>

<p>A person growing for their own personal use can feel free to do what they want with their crop, unless it falls under the facilitation of business operations.</p>

<p>This system could potentially eliminate businesses which take advantage of people, in that a person could operate on a small business scale, but as a non-profit entity that is ran through donations.</p>

<p>This would ensure people have the option to either 1) cultivate their own crop for themselves and their personal purposes &lt; sharing with friends or throwing down at parties or hooking up their regular club staff &gt; , 2) operate as a non-profit which receives donations &lt; a person who grows extra crop like maybe 10 for himself and 10 for sale by means of donation, which would be given an initial value based on the cost of the operation, or 3) Run a full blown marijuana business.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that hard to enact sensible legislation to that effect, and anybody doing anything illegal would be subject to the terms of those infractions in a just and fair manner. This would &quot;fix&quot; the problem of violent gangs in that their violence wouldn&#39;t be forced by the system, and they would be subject to the terms of those violent crimes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that we should have to enact legislation which specifically bans aspects of production such as processes and ingredients, but adversely I say that we regulate that these facts must be transparently displayed and readily provided by the business for access by consumers.</p>

<p>This is to be reinforced by a strong database which oversees and protects individual citizen safety based on correctly obtained data and intelligent decisions based on it.</p>

<p>All of these things further even out the income inequality problem as it combats multiple aspects of the sources of income inequality, such as our current form of legislation which enacts regulations which ensure that businesses always have the upper hand in ensuring that citizen nor municipality nor collective nor any other amalgam of citizenry to provide themselves with the services of the established businesses.</p>

<p>When we do away with our current form of regulations, we will open up all of our communities for economic prosperity by allowing for collective gathering of resources in a manner which benefits the local citizens, thus strengthening all citizens abroad through interwoven local, regional, national, and international success.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There will ALWAYS be people that abuse the system. That&#39;s why we need a third party to mediate and, in some cases, act preemptively so people aren&#39;t hurt or killed. </p>
