    <div class="md"><p>Easy Question.</p>

<p>When the government gives you free food, free housing, free money and free phones and of course free sports you have nice things to distract you from the fact that you need free hand outs from the government (which is stealing them from the middle class) to support you because the cost of living in your nation so vastly out strips the ability of the masses of the lower class to survive on minimum wage, there is no reason to protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is coming to the U.S. and I think the government knows too and thats why they are massing guns and ammo with armored tanks and hardcore riot gear. Also practicing shooting targets that look like American women, children, and elderly. It&#39;s also the reason they are spying on us. they are gathering information before the situation comes so that they know who to target when it happens. We are the new enemy and its not long before they engage us. There is going to be some new event that takes place that is going to put the people over the edge. Maybe another war. maybe something as simple as cops killing another innocent person. The conditions are all set for this country to erupt into a shit storm </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh ya dude it is a lot closer than people think. The government is running drills in major cities using the army to practice for civil unrest. there is videos of it on youtube of them flying helicopters through miami shooting fake rounds off. Also in Texas they practiced taking over buildings. All kinds of drills. It is slowly heating up. All I can think of is to get a bunch of food and water and self defense. I will do my part when the time comes because I know my life is screwed if I do or do not resist. Might as well resist like some of the jews did who didn&#39;t want to go down in history as cowards/sheep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh ya for sure idk how I forgot to mention that. That is something everyone can see too. Working more for less money (inflation) prices going up but our wages don&#39;t go up. Stores closing, homeless cities. I totally believe we are in the middle of a collapse. And they have no plans on reversing it. I think that is exactly what is on their minds because they have a even better idea of what is really going on. One day we will wake up and the dollar will have collapsed and then the shit will really hit the fan. Its just what happens to paper currencies</p>

The apocalypse has arrived in major portions of the planet and it&#39;s only because we live within a bubble of incredible privilege and social insulation that we still have the luxury of anticipating the apocalypse.

I believe the system has been set up too well, and that is why we won&#39;t do anything until we are stripped of everything. Bad things that are worth stopping are happening to Americans on a daily basis, but these things don&#39;t affect our immediate routine. That is why this is still far off from happening. As sad as it is to say, the system has probably already decided when it will force a public uprising. Even then it will probably be for its own needs, not ours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The revolution must be spiritual/psychological, and it must never come to violence, for if it does that will be an excuse to retaliate with violence, and all the handguns in the US will not be able to match the trillions invested in the military. 
That being said a social revolution is already taking place. Evidence of such can be seen in the legalization of recreational marijuana; Legal in three states, now it seems every day more state senators are proposing legislation. 
Economic revolution can also be seen in the rise of cryptocurrencies. The central bankers that have been puppeteering mankind of millenia are losing their grip. 
The internet spreads information 10x as efficiently as MSM which has been manipulating the masses since the radio. </p>
