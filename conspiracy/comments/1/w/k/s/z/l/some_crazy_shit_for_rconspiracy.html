        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t expect any of you to believe this at this point, but you might be hearing a lot about me fairly soon...or you may never hear from me again.  I have been stalked by the US government for the last five years.  It is what is called &quot;Gangstalking.&quot;  My local police department, in conjunction with local and national news media have installed hidden cameras in my house, bugged my phone and car and are using that information to torture me mentally for the last five years.   They use this information to disrupt every aspect of my life by slandering me to everyone I come into contact with.   They have stolen items from my home, hacked my computer on numerous occasions to delete and install files, gone yo employeers and had me fired or orevented me from getting a job, cased health problems for my father because of the stress that this has caused him, and hav literally driven me insane in order to discredit and more easily frame me. And now they have recruited my family and former friends to participate in the stalking/framing.  The media, particuarily Atlanta&#39;s WSB has threatened to murder my family I and have promised retaliation if I sue them.  The stalking is so bad that I am affraid  to leave the house, leave my family alone by themselves, say the wrong thing that could be twisted and used against me or even to dream the wrong dream.  This is much bigger than just my local police or media; it extends into every facet of the Federal government and every media organization.  I believe the people perpetrating this crime are lying to people about me I order to get them to participate.  Again, I don&#39;t expect any of you to believe me and yes, I am taking my medicine.  But this really is some NWO 1% shit.   I have never believed in conspiracy theories, but I&#39;m telling you COINTELPRO and gangstalking is alive and well. If you accuse someone of crimes play on the fears of the people, you really can get away with murder.  This is a 21st century high-tech lynching; like nothing this country has ever seen, or at least never heard about before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hon, re: the medicine you&#39;re taking, is there anyone you can talk to about this right away? Like your prescribing doctor as soon as you can? Not saying you&#39;re not being stalked, and maybe there is something to this, but I was (I&#39;m sorry) nosy and looked at your history, Saphris has some serious side effects, including akathisia. Your doctor will hopefully be able to help slowly wean you down to lessen the side effects (please get in touch with your prescribing doctor and DON&#39;T go cold turkey, studies show that can make it worse), but please, please contact someone you trust that can help. </p>

<p>If you are being gangstalked, firstly having someone help you get rid of the side effects of the Saphris will help you deal with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m vaguely familiar with Bashar and a few other channeled entities. I would definitely say that the truth as presented by Bashar resonates within me, and since I began viewing my existence in light of this truth, my entire world has changed. It is just hard to stay on the path, when so many others falter. The changes that I seek within myself seem too small, too insignificant to help anyone other than me.. and I dislike feeling selfish. More than anything, I want to elevate all of humanity - not just myself. I realize that change is a process which occurs throughout time, but the amount of suffering that occurs in this reality disheartens and demoralizes me.</p>

<p>I know you didn&#39;t literally mean to kill myself, I was just enjoying our Matrix metaphors. :]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am enjoying the metaphors as well. I was just curious since I would like to end it all as well (just to see what in the heck it all is about), but somehow I think that would not be worth it. </p>

<p>Reading what you said there makes me think of another bible verse which is something like &quot;Blessed are you when you are persecuted for the sake of the Lord&quot;. What I take that to mean is that when you suffer, it is a learning experience. Too many people falter off of your chosen path? God is afraid and you just leveled up. Demoralization sucks and I have been there. </p>

<p>What about that &quot;sonder&quot; post? You could be inspiration in another&#39;s life and not even know it. </p>

<p>&quot;Doubts are like bothersome flies and must all be crushed&quot; - Samurai Champloo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you. Gangstalking is real. Every recent &quot;crisis event/false flag&quot; has been perpetrated by someone who has alleged that they were a victim of electronic harassment and/or physical gangstalking. I would tell you to stay safe, but that hardly seems like an option. Honestly, maybe you should just flee the country?</p>

<p>I wish there was something that we could do to help the undetermined number of people that claim they are victims of gangstalking and related types of harassment, but I really don&#39;t think there is anything that can be done. Don&#39;t give in to paranoia, and keep your wits about you. Try to avoid typical avenues of neuro-linguistic programming, such as television, and whatever you do, <em>do not</em> take any psychedelic substances. I have a strong suspicion that gangstalking victims are first primed through forms of harassment, and then become enwrapped in an alternate reality game which takes its cues from halted government mind control programs which emphasized the use of entheogenic substances to trigger alternate patsy personas.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a family member who went through something similar. They were convinced that someone was doing the same thing, saying words that they knew were meant for them on the news/twitter/facebook/etc., along with putting hidden cameras everywhere. Then they stopped taking Adderall (which they had an RX for), and the paranoia went away. If you&#39;re taking a stimulant for something like ADHD or something with paranoia as a side effect, talk to your doctor. Good luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened to me last year as well. I was a big weed smoker and wound up so paranoid because of these coincidences, I felt like I was being followed by a negative energy. I didn&#39;t know what it was, god, the government, illuminati, myself, ghosts, angels, demons. I wound up in the hospital and was held for 3 days but after an evaluation all they were able to say was I had depression and marijuana induced psychosis. I will never say it wasn&#39;t real because it absolutely was. </p>

<p>I quit smoking weed after that and no longer suffer from paranoia. I suggest OP do the same. My theory is that you can open yourself up to that sort of phenomena by messing with your consciousness. You are basically inviting whoever into your individual experience. Being free from (most) drugs, not saying certain medications, can make you a lot more strong minded and it&#39;s protecting your own psych. </p>

<p>I have seen many lawsuits against universities go public.</p>

<p>Why is your lawsuit so damaging? </p>

<p>Out them in a public forum with some sort of proof and that could help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen A Beautiful Mind? I think you just have schizophrenia just like John Nash.  No one is out to get you, your mind plays tricks on you. </p>

<p>Maybe its even more than just an obsessive compulsion playing tricks on your mind too, perhaps you are schizophrenic seriously. Your &quot;haunt&quot; is people out to get you and you may indeed literally see things that are not actually there. </p>

<p>I think you should consider seeing a medical professional. Wouldn&#39;t it be a relief to learn than it is all in your head, no one is out to get you and you simply have a treatable mental condion that you can probably fully recover from someday? </p>
