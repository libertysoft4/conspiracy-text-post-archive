    <div class="md"><p>All of them. Each minor child victim has parents who are now actively engaged in the issue of gun control legislation. Some not from a mere Google search, but it is all there. There are a few kids where it is only one parent. </p>

<p>If this is a coincidence, it is ALSO fascinating that way. </p>

<p>That this event would call ALL the families to such swift and certain action so quickly.</p>

<p>No matter which way you look at it, the families&#39; responses- jumping in to legislation, speaking at meetings and with lobbyists, teaming up with congressman, starting their own non-profits after leaving their other jobs-  it is noteworthy.  Either it was planned, or in one fell swoop, all of the mourning families felt called to very engaged action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh thank you, thank you!</p>

<p>There are a few things about this story that struck a personal chord, and as someone incessantly seeking the truth, I continue to do so.  I am not a &quot;conspiracy nut&quot;- as in I dont assume everything I hear has a spin, or is fabricated. <em>However</em>, by the same token, I do not believe everything I hear blindly either. </p>

<p>I think having a central place (at least for me) to put my ideas and information is crucial to getting closer to what is going on here.  </p>

<p>I had a family member recently call me &quot;weird&quot; for being interested in this....Wondering why I &quot;care so much&quot;, things along those lines. </p>

<p>It is sad that looking for the truth has to be done covertly, while blindly accepting statements without supporting evidence is A-ok.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to keep looking, and check back here for more info.... I&#39;m going to find some other coincidences!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t live very far from Newtown (Sandy Hook) and can tell you that so many homes with the same sale date for 0.00 is not typical. It makes no sense. I looked up other streets, random ones, with NO victims&#39; families living there, and sale dates differ, sale prices are reasonably what you would expect, and aside from the occasional ownership transfer from parents to child for example which would indicate a $0 purchase, nothing that looked like the victims&#39; families...... also of note: </p>

<p>the Town of Newtown, the State of CT and the Iroquois Gas Co Inc purchased &quot;transferred&quot; property into their names on 12/25/09 for $0 as well.   This went on all over town. </p>

<p>There may be a legitimate reason for this, so I am not coming up with some random reason to fit a hypothesis, just noting that it sticks out as another anomaly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely nothing.  Huge discrepancies in appraised vs assessed are VERY common.  If you want to get weird about it, as a homeowner you can appeal an assessment when they try to base your assessed value on recent sales nearby.  That&#39;s kind of common in affluent areas.</p>

But I can say that due to a job a had for a while I was firsthand witness to the way good people are urged to do things to put a spin on something, and then the way it is reported differently in the media. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to say a lot on this except that if I didn&#39;t have some of the info that I have now, I would have never been driven to do this. This is my free time and I&#39;m digging for facts on a national tragedy that has speculation surrounding it?  I have friends, a family, hobbies.

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what that means?</p>

<p>Edit: I was just taking notice of the fact that public records shows that one of the victim&#39;s mothers has an alias and that one of the two last names she uses is Lafferty. (Which happens to be the maiden name of the principal) Which is no crime. However, the obituary lists the victim&#39;s aunt as having the same name as the mother&#39;s AKA. So, it could be a mix up, an error in the obit, a woman who uses her sister&#39;s identity, or faulty event planning. </p>

<p>Again, as I continue to reiterate, I&#39;m merely pointing out things that stick out <em>to me</em>; I&#39;m not pointing fingers, placing blame, or even speculating as to what is really going on here. I am smart enough to admit that 1.I have no clue, and 2. Something is amiss based upon the totality of the circumstances IN MY OPINION.</p>

<p>I do not spout things off to people who don&#39;t want to hear it, I generally keep these thoughts to myself, and I enjoy thinking methodically and rationally to achieve a truthful conclusion. This situation seems to merit a second look, and so that is what I am giving it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A town that keeps coming up as having had different family members living there at one point or another is Pawling NY. </p>

<p>I had never heard of it, but I expected it to be large, due to its reappearance as a town where several people connected to the event lived.  </p>

<p>According to the 2010 census, 8,463 people lived there at the time. </p>

<p>Anyone known anything about Pawling NY and why it coincidentally came up so many times?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I can&#39;t imagine posting without <em>some</em> form of reference, citation, proof or at least supporting information.  I know that it seems oxymoronic at times to cite the internet AGAINST another internet source- but all we can do sometimes is fight fire with fire because it is all we have got.  Which is why, I look to state records that are public, ct.gov, and Town Assessor&#39;s sites. I go to websites for corporations and seek bios listed there, I don&#39;t base it off of other forums. I try to get to the source. Please keep visiting, investigating is both a hobby and a profession for me, I am fortunate. This topic is both emotionally gripping as well as frustrating, so I love the challenge. </p>

The other thing that strikes an off chord with Noah and the official story is he had severe autism. As well did Emilie, Josephine, Jesse and Olivia. Some have theorized that Sandy Hook was operating as a Special Ed center with only kindergartners. Not a K-4 as the official story states. Plus where are all the 3 rd and 4th graders who could verbalize and explain what happened on that day much more articulately. They always interview the young ones.</p>

How many websites malfunctioned? Are we to believe in illogical coincidence over veritable proof? That part baffles my mind. It was not even well coordinated.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one that you can ask any infantryman in the Armed Forces:</p>

<p>Is it possible for a severely autistic kid, scared of loud noises such as the 2-stroke engine on a leafblower who weighs less than 140lbs to don a considerable amount (weight-wise) of body armor, tactical gear, FOUR guns, and ammunition to then break into a school, jump through the broken window, go on to achieve an INVERTED kill-to-injure ratio in an incredibly short time while expending enough ammo to ENSURE that almost ALL of the victims would die (3-14 bullet wounds EACH??)</p>

<p>This was a professional raid, done by a team of trained killers. See &quot;Port Arthur Massacre.&quot;</p>

<p>The late Joe Viallis wrote a piece on Port Arthur that shows why an &quot;op&quot; like SH simply CANNOT succeed without incredibly well-trained and disciplined gunmen.</p>

<p>Port Arthur is what was responsible for taking guns out of Australian/New Zealand citizens&#39; hands forever...FYI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems to be the most commonly asked question by skeptics when someone challenges the official story. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gun control doesn&#39;t seem like a good reason, there are better ways to accomplish that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is highly contradictory. The fact is, it is all about gun control. Whether it&#39;s an inside job or not, the change that the government is proposing because of this incident is restricting gun ownership, period. Just listen to the Presidents SOTU where he used Sandy Hook as an example of why he&#39;s going to act unilaterally in signing new gun laws. With or without the  Congress.</p>

<p>And as far as there being better way to make American&#39;s acquiesce and give up there guns, there&#39;s no better way then to quilt them into it. &quot;But it&#39;s for the children!&quot;</p>

<p>Can you give an example of what would work better?</p>

<p>Ive gotten to the point where im convinced everything that the mainstream media is covering is either an outright lie, or is a fluff piece meant to distract you from the real news.</p>

<p>To demonstrate my point, ask the next three people you talk to what their opinion about Casey Anthony and then ask them their opinion about the LIBOR scandal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luckily I don&#39;t like the mainstream media either. I don&#39;t follow the main media sources although I have family/friends in the industry the majority of what they cover is not what is on MSNBC, CNN, etc. I form my own opinions through my own sources, what I hear from friends of friends (some cover big things), etc. I&#39;ve photographed politicians and know how the events work/are controlled to present themselves in a good light. (I&#39;m in Illinois so gotta love the corrupt Chicago politicians although the central/smaller town politicians are much better)</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t follow the coverage of major trials on the 24/7 networks like George Zimmerman and Casey Anthony. It&#39;s purely for viewers, not news.</p>

<p>You&#39;re asking me why I think that fire is hot.  I could explain the radiation of heat and nerve cells sending messages to my brain and why there&#39;s pain and blah blah but that is just a waste of time.  Fire is hot beacuse when I put my hand up to it I feel heat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh thank you, thank you!</p>

<p>There are a few things about this story that struck a personal chord, and as someone incessantly seeking the truth, I continue to do so.  I am not a &quot;conspiracy nut&quot;- as in I dont assume everything I hear has a spin, or is fabricated. <em>However</em>, by the same token, I do not believe everything I hear blindly either. </p>

<p>I think having a central place (at least for me) to put my ideas and information is crucial to getting closer to what is going on here.  </p>

<p>I had a family member recently call me &quot;weird&quot; for being interested in this....Wondering why I &quot;care so much&quot;, things along those lines. </p>

<p>It is sad that looking for the truth has to be done covertly, while blindly accepting statements without supporting evidence is A-ok.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to keep looking, and check back here for more info.... I&#39;m going to find some other coincidences!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...No. Gah this is frustrating/annoying.  What I can say is that I never thought I&#39;d be posting to this sub, I thought all &quot;you people&quot; were nuts or something. But I can say that due to a job a had for a while I was firsthand witness to the way good people are urged to do things to put a spin on something, and then the way it is reported differently in the media. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to say a lot on this except that if I didn&#39;t have some of the info that I have now, I would have never been driven to do this. This is my free time and I&#39;m digging for facts on a national tragedy that has speculation surrounding it?  I have friends, a family, hobbies. But this is important, and suffice to say that NONE of us here are wasting our time.</p>

<p>But I can&#39;t do it alone.  I wish I could tell you more.</p>
