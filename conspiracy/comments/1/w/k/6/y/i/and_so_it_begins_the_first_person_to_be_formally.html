    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but reading that paragraph, that doesn&#39;t sound accurate to my experience at all.</p>

<p>Edit:  Ok.  Since I continue to get downvotes.  I will demonstrate for those that don&#39;t see it.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZSk4NAZ.png">http://i.imgur.com/ZSk4NAZ.png</a></p>

<p>In the red we have 44,443 &#39;upvotes&#39;  in the blue we 40,699 &#39;downvotes.&#39;  In the gray we have the difference between the two. The number that is supposed to always be accurate.  3764.    Now take a look at the front page of <a href="/r/all/top/">/r/all/top/</a>  or <a href="/r/all/hot">/r/all/hot</a> notice how the magic number hovers between 3-4000 on almost every post, every single day?  The number of upvotes gradually goes up through the day by the thousands, but it doesn&#39;t matter if the post has 6000 total upvotes or 100,000 upvotes, the downvote differential will virtually always stay in that 3500 range .  That is the point of diminishing returns of their algorithm. Now, there are some exceptions and anomalies, I recall the Bill Gates AMA, going up to 18,000 once,  I believe someone was probably playing god there, and some do go up higher briefly if they are popular enough.  But as far as the number on the left always being accurate.  Heh.  I thought everyone had this figured out already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that wouldn&#39;t be accurate at all.  </p>

<p>Look at the front page.  Whether a post has 40000 upvotes or 6000 upvotes the difference in upvotes and downvotes always magically hovers in the 2-4000 range.  It doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure this out, and that this is not accurate, but I&#39;ve already explained how this is done ^ up there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The total is the sum of the up votes and down votes, there are no negative votes.  You are not using proper methodology.   So when we add the upvotes and the downvotes, each ones are listed there.  Say it&#39;s 32,000 upvotes and 28,000 downvotes.  The total would be 60,000 votes.   The number on the left signifies the DIFFERENCE in the votes.  so we take 32,000-28,000 = a 4,000 difference.   And by no means is the difference accurate, at all.</p>

<p>Notice, the red upvotes count 44,443 and the blue is the downvotes  40,699.  The gray number is the <em>difference</em> between the two 3764.</p>

<p>The whole point of me saying this is show that the downvotes are not real, that whether there are 50,000 <em>upvotes</em> or or 6,000 <em>upvotes</em> the number of <em>downvotes</em> will magically hover ~3,500 votes beneath this number.  </p>

<p>There is no way for me to illustrate this by using your method of counting.  Are you with me yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that may be fuzzed somewhat too - I remember reading something about balancing votes with the number of people on site too, so that you can compare two posts, one from 5 years ago and one from now, and the like/dislike ratio will be accurate, but the numbers not.  Essentially to take int account the number of people who have joined reddit.  Not sure how true that is or when it kicks in though.</p>

<p>NSA knows. Their power lies in knowing more than you. Information is their power. They don&#39;t have to make things up about folks. They just have to connect the dots, and you are done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that this was a very popular post AND it can easily be argued that this is world news. Anything major that happens to the NSA in court would be reported all over the world because it&#39;s world news. You really think this post was some kind of a nuisance and is being removed per the original intentions of the rule &quot;no internal US politics?&quot; That rule is for submissions that people outside of the US couldn&#39;t care less about and to free up slots for the entire world to participate in the front page of the sub. The entire world, I&#39;m guessing, would be generally interested in this post. Therefore, the mod who removed it did so ONLY because he could say that it technically violated a rule. He can&#39;t say that the removal did something good for the worldnews sub. So the mod is simply enforcing rules because they are rules, not because he wants to be a good mod. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People of this country need to wake up!!! Why isn&#39;t all this NSA corruption being covered ALOT more??? Our government is out of control and we are being spied on at a level George Orwell himself could not grasp. The problem is all the stupid people out there that do not care and are generally just too ignorant to even understand what is going on. It is time for us to demand that our government stop spying on us. We need to replace every single politician currently in this country. It is time for a revolution! I truly do fear for the future of this country. Our population is getting dumber and dumber each and every generation. This is what the government wants. Educated people that are aware of what is going on in the world are the threat to our government. They will keep us in the dark as long as they can. There is a better way but we will never get there until we overcome our petty differences and unite as one. We need to keep ourselves educated and not listen to what the government allows the media to tell us. The Republicans and Democrats are just trying to confuse the people at every corner to keep us ignorant of their thievery. We need reform people! Our country is being threatened by the very same fools we keep electing to office. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it amusing you think there is still some battle to be fought. Bottlom line is American citizens are lazy and aren&#39;t willing to actually risk anything for these rights and freedoms. It is so easy to go on the interwebs and blast something but are you willing to give up a day of work? Maybe your job in order to protect what&#39;s rightfully yours. The answer 10 years ago may have been yes, luckily though the feds and corps have systematically made the majority of civilians so poor they could never risk taking to the streets and voice a concern when they have such overbearing debt above their heads and moreso general lack of motivation and willingness to take responsibility. It won&#39;t be until your citizens can unite and realize this is far beyond whatever selfish reasoning they may have that something may be accomplished. Luckily you have religion, gay marriage and people of colour to keep you all hating and fearing each other. In reality I&#39;m sick of these posts saying &quot;stand up and do something, protect your freedoms, we must act!&quot; Lets just all get over that funny misconception right now and step back into reality and evaluate the situtation that has no control.</p>

<p>The major problem I mostly see with this is selfishness. You&#39;re all only willing to stand up because you want to have a better life and all that white picket fence shit. Let&#39;s squash that dream right now. America has a very long road to travel up hill in order to even see the word great on the horizon. Many of you need to realize that it is not going to be your livelyhood you&#39;re fighting for, thats gone, fucked and down the drain. You need to understand it&#39;s about your kids and grand kids and securing a slight glimmer of a future for them which at best is very bleak.</p>

<p>*I should mention too this is simply an opinion of someone living outside your box and looking in.</p>

I know an alright amount of people who care. But as you pointed out it&#39;s only enough to bitch on the Internet and vote against those you are trained to hate.</p>

<p>The sad truth I see for myself is to work extremely hard for a &quot;chance&quot; to earn some good money so I can actually afford to enjoy life without constantly worrying about everything.

    <div class="md"><p>I just think the major push for &quot;pure capitalism&quot; that is present in our culture is toxic.  Capitalism without any restraints or regulations is great for businesses but terrible for consumers.  This is readily apparent with where our country now is and is moving to.  Essential services like higher education and healthcare are unaffordable to the masses without taking on massive debts, pushing our country backwards as these 2 sectors have risen exponentially in the past 2 decades.  We are witnessing the baby boomers bastardizing everything they were given by heir parents; everything that they worked so hard to give us.  These opportunities are being seamlessly swept away.  This ties in to most people here being dumb/lazy/overworked/tired like I said because they like one team and just decide it&#39;s easiest to go along with everything said team pushes forward as it must be the best thing for everyone, it must be true what they say and cannot be a lie.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t advocate any specific political system.  Not capitalism, not socialism, not communism, and not theocracies.  A hybrid of principles would most likely work best, but most people just choose sides like I said and have absolutely no interest in comprising or caring what happens to others.</p>

<p>Idk, perhaps other countries will follow our terrible ways someday.  I don&#39;t foresee that as friends of mine that have traveled to various countries, mostly in Europe, have said the culture there is very different than here.  More people oriented overall with actual respect to life outside of work.  Perhaps we will have a radical shift towards real change, but so far our radical shift in the past half century has been to travel back in time and become extremely conservative and nutty.  Democraps are barely left/liberal and are more moderate than anything.  Repubes are trying to outdo the inequality that occurred in the roaring 20s or so.</p>

They will simply be arrested, harassed, or swept under the rug while being ostracized.  We need millions, which won&#39;t happen.  You talk about this stuff with other but they mostly want to walk the party lines and firmly believe voting for the 2 evils will benefit us at some point.

We don&#39;t have many of those.  Shitty sound-bite media relies on taking a quote and the talking heads&#39; reaction to it.  But its classified so no one talks about it.

<p>Those who argue that the Constitution is a “living” document, argue that the meaning of the Constitution changes or evolves with time and context.  The people who favor the “living Constitution” concept are those who want rule by man (themselves) rather than rule by law (the Constitution).  Under the pretext that the Constitution is a “living” document, the Constitution can mean anything anyone in a position of power says it means at any time.

<p>In Scalia’s view the Constitution is “<strong>dead, dead, dead</strong>” in the sense that it’s meaning is <strong>fixed, fixed, fixed</strong>. The Constitution is “dead” in the sense that the meaning of the Constitution is not lawfully subject to continuous meddling and reinterpretation by those who advocate the “living Constitution”.

<p>Muhtorov was targeted by the Uzbek government because of his work with human rights groups in his homeland. He fled and resettled in Aurora, Colo., in 2007, as a political refugee and became a legal permanent U.S. resident.</p>

<p>To my knowledge the bill of rights, 4th amendment in particular, are meant to bar actions and laws of the Federal government.  Being a legal resident, he should be just as protected from unconstitutional federal laws as a citizen.  I am unsure of application to illegal residents.</p>

<p>Wholesale surveillance has been an important issue to the ACLU for quite some time, but the Supreme Court has made some decisions about standing that make it very difficult to address. You can&#39;t sue unless you know you are under surveillance, and since the surveillance is secret, you can&#39;t know about it. Clever, eh?</p>

<p>Not necessarily, but I do think it is important to note the distinction. If I go to a foreign country and purchase a product or service, that country has the option to charge me a tax on said product or service. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We, in this case,  consists of legal American citizens. I agree with you that the people need to have this documented in order to preserve our freedoms, but sadly, that is the world in which we live. Maybe in the future it will be different.</p>

<p>In particular, regarding citizenship, from AP,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Muhtorov was targeted by the Uzbek government because of his work with human rights groups in his homeland. He fled and resettled in Aurora, Colo., in 2007, as a political refugee and became a legal permanent U.S. resident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the charges, from Reuters,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Muhtorov, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, was arrested in January 2012 at O&#39;Hare International Airport in Chicago. Prosecutors said he was planning to head overseas to fight with the Islamic Jihad Union, a Pakistan-based resistant group that opposes secular rule in Uzbekistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, ex-Verizon manager here. We had a ton of people walking in yelling about just what you are talking about after the NSA news broke. The contract you signed obligates you for generally 2 years of service in exchange for the subsidized pricing on your phone (IE: $659 iPhone for $199). Your choice to use of Verizon as a service provider essentially strips you of said rights to privacy if law enforcement requests. If Verizon changes the terms of said contract you can cancel termination fee free though.</p>

I wish there was more information about the case because if the information gathered makes in obvious that he has motives of terrorism, then I&#39;d be glad they did it. But if it&#39;s just the government profiling and wasting money on being an ass hole then I&#39;d get really mad and throw something and probably yell a bunch (seriously).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been convinced for some time now that the trend of &#39;hushed up&#39; trials lately have been for this reason. Especially high profile cases like the Boston bombings and Batman shooter. They perhaps used evidence obtained through some of these practices and didn&#39;t want to risk that information being public and them losing a case on those grounds or having public outcry so closely tied to an event like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This just highlights the fact that the NSA stuck to the letter of the law with regards to data collected.  I&#39;ll say it again - no other criminal activities have been prosecuted using data gathered by the NSA.  They stuck rigidly to their filtering systems, they didn&#39;t even pass information regarding deplorable crimes such as murders, child pedophile rings or rapists.  </p>

<p>The problem now is that if Obama okays the data collection he may force them to share the information with all law enforcement agencies.  So if you have a weed party going on you might get busted.  Exactly what the NSA didn&#39;t use the information for.  Personally I&#39;m okay with them collecting info on people if it means it protects Western citizens both at home and abroad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you do. Shame though that it has fuck-all success protecting anyone and of course the fact that we all have to be spied on because of a handful of possible terrorists makes you feel sooo safe doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I hope that none of my muslim friends are in any way connected to any dodgy dealings because I have no idea if they are; but hey, if I get arrested one day just for knowing them, that also makes me feel sooo safe.</p>

<p>You are now safe because you are being spied on and could in the future be arrested for something you have no idea about? What a lot of BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agreed to share it, <em>if law enforcement requests it.</em> The understanding there is that there needs to be some kind of paper trail asking for access to a set or piece of data.
