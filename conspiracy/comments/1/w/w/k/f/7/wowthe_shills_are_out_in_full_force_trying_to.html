<p>Scroll down a bit and see the &quot;list of shills.&quot; Compare that to the top commenter in the 9/11 thread being hijacked right now. The top commenter is in that list because back then, he had no activity whatsoever for that month, except for that thread.

<p>Nice example from someone down below ,downplaying of facts and manipulation /derailment going on , very blatantly. 
Sometimes im not sure if these are payed shills or really stupid close-minded people.

<p>At a certain point it doesn&#39;t even matter, both groups use the same tactics - dumb it down, start arguments, change the subject, change the argument, attack the source rather than the info, etc.  They do all of the same things either way and the effect is the same.  I think people are starting to catch on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed the flood of downvotes, but I wouldn&#39;t call the people shills. I think most of them are actually regular citizens who take a hostile stance to conspiracy questions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really bewildering to think that &quot;9/11 conspiracies&quot; are so divisive when any patriotic American should demand a thorough investigation of all angles that day. The term &quot;9/11 conspiracy&quot; doesn&#39;t refer to any specific plan. It just implies that we haven&#39;t been shown the full investigation. </p>

<p>How anyone can disagree with that shows their own level of cognitive biases.</p>

<p>My biggest issue is just how hostile people can be to anyone who insists the government hides things from us.</p>

<p>Well, you were &quot;ignoretheshill&quot; until you accidentally sent me a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/E8kXRri.jpg">screenshot of your profile and forgot to hide your name.</a> </p>

<p>That account got deleted shortly after that little fuckup.</p>

<p>Before that, you were NineteenEightyTwo, but you deleted that account after you were banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for being a belligerent jackass. </p>

<p>And now you are serfnomics.  I&#39;m sure there are plenty of others. </p>

<p>Shawshank...Another vaporized plane. Bullshit...no black box as well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming you mean Shanksville? Both of the boxes from flight 93 were recovered. Planes don&#39;t just have <em>one</em> box either, there is a data recorder (FDR) and a voice recorder (CVR). They played parts of the CVR from flight 93 in court for the Zacarias Moussaoui trial which happened in 2006 (a lot of evidence was saved for this trial, including the Citgo and Doubletree videos from the pentagon crash), and supposedly for the victims families as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this against or for the conspriacy, but if you&#39;re going to talk about the official story, you should at least have your events of what they porport correct, otherwise it makes you look uneducated on the very subject you are pretending to know so much about.</p>

<p>This is what part was played in court:</p>

<p>Officially, they were never found, but there&#39;s some people who worked on the cleanup who said they helped FBI recover 3 of the 4. Why they would cover those two up, and not the other for from Shanksvilles and the Pentagon seems odd though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;black boxes&quot;, from Flights 11 and 175 were not recovered from the remains of the WTC attack; however, two men, Michael Bellone and Nicholas DeMasi, who worked extensively in the wreckage of the World Trade Center, said in the book Behind-The-Scenes: Ground Zero[178] that they helped federal agents find three of the four &quot;black boxes&quot; from the jetliners.</p>

<p>Dude...are you shitting me?  Iran Contra was a secret for A YEAR, at which point it was exposed, investigated and paraded around in the media for MONTHS!</p>

<p>How is this a point in your favor?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A declassified CIA document dated 7 Jan 1953 [1] describes the creation of multiple personality in 19-year old girls. &quot;These subjects have clearly demonstrated that they can pass from a fully awake state to a deep H [hypnotic] controlled state ... by telephone, by receiving written matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words and that control of those hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without great difficulty. It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>A CIA document dated 10 Feb 1954 [4] describes an experiment on the creation of unsuspecting assassins: &quot;Miss [deleted] was then instructed (having expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken Miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep) and failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that she would not hesitate to &quot;kill.&quot; Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted]. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened. Miss [deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened.&quot; BB 36, 37</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An 11-year old boy underwent a partial change of identity upon remote stimulation of his brain electrode: &quot;Electrical stimulation of the superior temporal convolution induced confusion about his sexual identity. These effects were specific, reliable, and statistically significant. For example, the patient said, &#39;I was thinking whether I was a boy or a girl,&#39; and &#39;I&#39;d like to be a girl.&#39;&quot; After one of the stimulations the patient suddenly began to discuss his desire to marry the male interviewer. Temporal-lobe stimulation produced in another patient open manifestations and declarations of pleasure, accompanied by giggles and joking with the therapist. In two adult female patients stimulation of the same region was followed by discussion of marriage and expression of a wish to marry the therapist. [64] BB 88, 89</p>

<p>Government mind control experiments have been proven successful. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I can hypnotize a man -- without his knowledge or consent -- into committing treason against the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I’ll call Jones. Under the watchful eye of Marine intelligence I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a &#39;normal&#39; working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member. All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>everyone knows about it now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of the populace doesn&#39;t know about it. The Church Committee exposing what they did, still didn&#39;t bring about the cessation of government mind control experiments. It appeased people to the extent that they would think it&#39;s out in the open and the CIA must be sorry and ceased. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>14-year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducts disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKUltra was abandoned a &quot;cover story.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkultra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkultra</a></p>

<p>As recently as 2006, government documents have surfaced that discuss approval authorities for non-consensual human experimentation involving mind control and severe and unusual physical and psychological intrusions. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/05/30/871505/-Obama-Interrogation-Official-Linked-to-U-S-Mind-Control-Research#">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/05/30/871505/-Obama-Interrogation-Official-Linked-to-U-S-Mind-Control-Research#</a></p>

<p>The Church Committee also investigated Operation Mockingbird- the severe infiltration of American media by the CIA. Like Mkultra, their investigation of the matter didn&#39;t equal its cessation. Carl Bernstein, of Woodward and Bernstein fame (the journalists who broke Watergate) did a thorough investigation of this matter not long ago and came to the conclusion that the CIA still views the media as very much &quot;up for grabs.&quot; </p>

<p><em>THE CIA AND THE MEDIA How Americas Most Powerful News Media Worked Hand in Glove with the Central Intelligence Agency and Why the Church Committee Covered It Up</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php">http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php</a></p>

<p>Just because some information surfaced about a CIA plot doesn&#39;t mean that the CIA has abandoned said plot. The amount of information we have on MkUltra precludes us from judging the &quot;success&quot; of the endeavors, but we know that many Americans were tortured by the CIA in projects that may very well have never ceased. </p>

<p>The actions of the first head of the APA in these matters left some kids unable to recognize their parents and others permanently comatose. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a load of bollocks. Philip Marshall spent years researching 911. He was a professional pilot rated in Boeing 727,737,747,757 and 767s. He wrote a few books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Bamboozle-War-Terror/dp/1468094580/">The Big Bamboozle</a> being one, and gave interviews, one of which is here and is well worth a listen:<br/>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXI8lnqEahQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXI8lnqEahQ</a>  </p>

<p>One of his main theories is that high level Saudi Arabians were involved, and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/senators-saudi-arabia-linked-911/story?id=15827925">Senators Graham and Kerry agree with him</a>.</p>

<p>Philip Marshall knew a hell of a lot about 911 and it&#39;s obvious to anyone that looks into it. And it&#39;s almost exactly one year since his and his kids death. RIP Phil and thanks for the effort.</p>

<p>I was originally explaining to you what a chimney effect was, and explained that this is not what happened to WTC 1 &amp; 2, but did occur in WTC7.</p>

<p>You then proceeded to post some of the standard conspiracy theorist conjecture that&#39;s already been refuted several times (fire not hot enough to melt steel, building fell at free fall speeds, etc.) and when I pointed out that your information was incorrect, and supplied the evidence to support exactly WHY your information was incorrect, you proclaimed that you didn&#39;t want to be bothered reading the information: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m going to be honest with you, I skipped through almost all of what you wrote because I&#39;m tired of the debunkers tactics of shoving a shit ton of text that says nothing worth a damn </p>

<p><a href="/u/GayUnicorn6969">/u/GayUnicorn6969</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, where I come from, when someone makes a claim to something, they back that claim up with evidence to support it. That &quot;shit ton of text&quot; you chose to ignore contained information that supported my point.  </p>

<p>Then you attempted to post some nonsense as to what &quot;squibs&quot; were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will you eventually concede that squibs can only occur in demolitions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when I called you on THIS, you suddenly decided you couldn&#39;t defend your position any further and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wsy3p/woman_looking_out_from_the_95th_floor_after_the/cf63bxm">switched tactics to the old ad hominem attack as an attempt to retreat from the discussion.</a></p>

<p>Sorry, but if you are going to post bullshit, you should expect people to call you on it. This doesn&#39;t make me a paid accomplice of the government, it makes me a rational-thinking human. I&#39;d suggest that you give it a try some time, but you may have to read a few things and I know how challenging that can be for you. ;-)</p>

<p>I have no problem with that at all. In fact, I invite discussion, even though I sometimes know they have an &quot;occupational bias&quot;, to use a different term. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t create too much of a problem besides the blatant ridicule and downvotes on posts. It&#39;s a problem, but not critical. Especially if more honest people comment and browse &quot;new&quot; to suffocate their efforts.  </p>

<p>Scroll down a bit and see the &quot;list of shills.&quot; Compare that to the top commenter in the 9/11 thread being hijacked right now. The top commenter is in that list because back then, he had no activity whatsoever for that month, except for that thread. Again, this time around he has no activity this month aside from this hijacked thread and happens to have been upvoted all the way to the top. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/largemason">http://www.reddit.com/user/largemason</a></p>

<p>Barry Jennings isn&#39;t much better. Uncorroborated information that doesn&#39;t really say anything. There were dead people in WTC 7 before the second plane hit? Yet, he was on the 23rd floor and got down to the eighth floor, when someone save him. He heard explosions. </p>

<p>What the fuck is this supposed to tell me, without a shred of evidence, eye-witness testimony from one guy and NOTHING from the other expect a lot conspiracies. He wasn&#39;t even fucking there, are you are holding him up as proof? Really?!?</p>
