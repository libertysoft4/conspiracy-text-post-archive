    <div class="md"><p><em>People leaving downvotes, I would like to know how you think I can improve the quality of my postings.  I welcome comments or messages with your opinion.</em>  </p>

<p>Right now, Fox is airing a segment on 9/11.  The usual stuff is happening:<br/>
* Rallying America around 9/11<br/>
* make mention of terrorism<br/>
* Military &#39;leaders&#39; are called in to discuss the event<br/>
* Its all very...patriotic.<br/>
* Building the Superb Owl up as not just a sporting event, but a symbol of American Freedoms  </p>

<p>Followed immediately by &quot;Three Days to Kill&quot; trailer, in which the main character is all about fighting terrorism.  </p>

<p>Slogans of Ads being repeated and played one right after the next:<br/>
&quot;Whatever happens next&quot;<br/>
&quot;The next big thing is here&quot;<br/>
&quot;After the Super Bowl, let&#39;s go crazy&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT:  I will keep using this post to add what I see.  I&#39;m making no claims nor offering opinions on the content.  I&#39;m simply writing what I see.</p>

<ul>
<li>Obama will be sitting down for an interview with Bill O&#39;Reily<br/></li>
<li>Segment on Bruno Mars in which it is stated, &quot;There is no bigger game (may have misheard this part) in the world.&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Commercial taking about military service.  &quot;Remember, respect.  Honor our fallen military heroes...&quot;(commercial ends before I can get the rest)  followed immediately by a Sonos commercial that plays the song I Shot the Sheriff, repeating the line &quot;Shot the Sheriff&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Montage of previous sporting victories<br/></li>
<li>Memorial tribute to Pat Summerall<br/></li>
<li>Commercial from Exxon extolling virtues of Natural Gas and how America needs it<br/></li>
<li>Segment on Champ Bailey, focused around how he is running out of time<br/></li>
<li>Didn&#39;t catch the audio, but I just saw a British Flag on screen, followed by a bullet hole appearing in it<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 2 - Taking a break<br/>
EDIT 3 - Back  </p>

<ul>
<li>Segment on Lombardi and how his success was directly related to his Faith and a sense of nationalism.  Extolling the virtues of New York and its citizens.  After talking about his strength of character, it returns to claim it was because of his faith, and participation in the army.  The whole segment was narrated by a priest in full garb.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;Fox is live and the center of the universe&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Bill Murray stating &quot;I&#39;m ready to help...in case of emergency.  That is what America is all about&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Phil Phillips playing his hit song &quot;Gone, gone, gone&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Gold Star Pins commercial, followed by two &quot;Whatever Happens Next&quot; commercials.  Followed by &quot;The Following&quot; commercial.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;Nothing is more American that the Super Bowl&quot;<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Obama Interview</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Obama interview starts with Healthcare, focusing on problems with the computers.<br/></li>
<li>Obama dodges questions about problems with computers and extolls virtues of healthcare.  Bill cutting off Obama&#39;s responses, trying to back him into a corner.  Being pretty disrespectful.</li>
<li>Shift to Libya.  Talking about terrorist attacks and how Obama knew of these.<br/></li>
<li>This is almost impossible to follow along.  Tons of mentions of terrorist attacks and protecting the American people.<br/></li>
<li>Shift to IRS and Schulman(sp?). </li>
<li>Obama says no corruption in IRS.</li>
<li>Obama predicts score of &quot;24-21&quot;<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Interview Ends</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Broncos and Seahawks get ready for battle&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Segment on Pete Carroll<br/></li>
<li>Segment on John Fox, centric around his hospitalization</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much happening at this point.  One could point to each commercial and discuss their conditioning methods, as each commercial is employing mnemonic devices.  Focus is shifting to exploration of the teams, coach and player interviews, and the build up for kick off.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Segments on Russel Wilson, Payton Manning<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pregame Show Begins</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Payton interview with NYC in the background, clearly showing Liberty Tower.<br/></li>
<li>Conan&#39;s spot is laden with sarcastic jabs at weed laws, police presence being overbearing, NYC in danger, expecting the unexpected<br/></li>
<li>(<strong>Opinion</strong>) Same commercials playing on repeat, as usual.  I suspect we&#39;ll see more poignant ads as viewer base increases.<br/></li>
<li>Reading of Declaration of Independence.  Segment extolling patriotism and military prior to the reading.  &quot;We must all hang together, or assuredly, we will hang separately.&quot;  Lots of military and American propaganda.  Varying players, owners, coaches, commentators reading the Declaration of Independence.<br/></li>
<li>Blatant appeal to American nationalism.  Michelle Obama extolling military troops.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;In order to protect OUR lives, OUR freedoms, OUR honor&quot;<br/></li>
<li>&quot;We must find more ways to honor the men and women that defend our liberties.&quot;<br/></li>
<li>The amount of nationalist rhetoric was too dense to follow along with.<br/></li>
<li>Many comments used to instill sentiment towards our military&#39;s presence at home and abroad.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>My stream cut out - resetting internet<br/>
Edit 100 - Internet back just in time to catch statement about about showing images of SuperBowls previous  </p>

<ul>
<li>Recognizing player&#39;s off field service - Charles Tillman wins Man of the Year award.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;In celebration of this beautiful country&quot; Queen Latifa leads &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Followed by Exxon commercial about multiple energy sources<br/></li>
<li>Preview of new Captain America movie mentioned directly after &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Weird spot with a gear rotating and people screaming in the background.  No text or voice over.  This is the second weird, out of place spot that didn&#39;t make sense.  The first being a British Flag with a bullet hole appearing in it.<br/></li>
<li>Team introductions overly dramatized, lots of impactful and heavy hitting verbiage.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;Run this Town&quot; by Rihanna playing in the background.  <a href="http://lyricsroll.com/rihanna/run-this-town.html">Lyrics</a><br/></li>
<li>National Anthem sung by Renee Fleming, cuts to armed forces in Afghanistan<br/></li>
<li>Military helicopter flyover as National Anthem comes to a close</li>
<li>&quot;As we march our way towards kickoff&quot;<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Game Begins</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Game is beginning.  My commentary will slow down as air time is consumed by game play.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;O Fortuna&quot; by Carl Orff(sp?) playing on kick off<br/></li>
<li>&quot;This is not a typical Super Bowl crowd&quot;<br/></li>
<li>First aerial coverage is images of Liberty Tower<br/></li>
<li>I missed this one, but <a href="/u/G_Wash1776">/u/G_Wash1776</a> points out very weird Maserati commercial  -&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpsrdldNAMM">Commercial</a></li>
<li>Ominous commercial about &quot;The Strain&quot; that states &quot;He is here (coming?)&quot; with dark clouds settling over NYC<br/></li>
<li><a href="/u/tobeornottobeTITQ">/u/tobeornottobeTITQ</a> offers their take-away of commercials playing<br/></li>
<li>Reference to the players as &#39;weapons&#39;<br/></li>
<li>Third weird spot - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAoX6xKyjKA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAoX6xKyjKA</a> - posted by <a href="/u/delelles">/u/delelles</a><br/></li>
<li>SuperBowl sponsored by Maserati, followed by America the Beautiful Coke commercial in various languages.<br/></li>
<li>British flag spot - sirens blaring in the background, ending with gun shot.  No text, no voice, no company logos.  What the hell is that spot? -&gt; These weird spots may be related to the show &quot;24&quot; as repeatedly mentioned in the comments.  They could also be related to the new Captain America film.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Halftime Begins</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Biggest concert in the world&quot; is beginning<br/></li>
<li>Starts with chorus of children singing about &quot;prepare&quot; with the American flag displayed prominently in the background<br/></li>
<li>Sirens blaring as accompaniment to the music<br/></li>
<li>Getting real patriotic now with messages from troops sending their best wishes to family members<br/></li>
<li>Continuation of the British Flag spot.  More bullet holes appear in addition to the previous one -&gt; (<strong>opinion</strong>) this is viral marketing for a TV show.  We will see the completion of this ad by the end.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;After the Superbowl, Brooklyn&#39;s 99 is ready to go&quot;<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Halftime Ends - Second Half Begins</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Audi commercial &quot;compromise scares us too&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Ads being punctuated by the sound of gunshots</li>
<li>Captain America spot premiers with the tag line &quot;In heroes we trust&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Budweiser pulls hard at America&#39;s heartstrings with homecoming commercial<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, there is a large repetition of things already covered in my edits.  I&#39;m pretty tired at this point, so I&#39;ll be posting less.  I&#39;ll stay with it till the end of the game, but will not be posting as much.  </p>

<p>Yup, there&#39;s the 24 tie together </p>

<p><strong>Final Edit</strong>:  Well there you have it folks.  The purpose of my post was to document media proceedings in the case that anything should happen.  While no terrorist attack occurred, this game was fraught with ultra patriotism and propaganda and left me feeling very odd about nationalist sentiment.  Take care everyone!</p>

<p><strong>no.</strong></p>

<p>that was an embarrasingly bad guess. </p>

<p>the saudis want a US intervention in syria, because the syrian rebels are heavily funded by the saudis. the syrian civil war is a proxy war, and the saudis want the US to intervene because if it doesnt, the assad regime will stay in power.</p>

<p>Who knows why?  It could be for a number of reasons, but I suspect there is something above and beyond the anti-Putin sentiment - something which is not yet publicly known.  The world could use some NSA staff who are reading this post right right now to actually do something useful and go sift through emails of Saudi, Russian and American officials, and make public any emails between them, pertaining to the Olympics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be giving my impression on many of the commercials. As they roll around I&#39;ll be starring the ones that really give off a strong message to me.</p>

<p>Sponsored by Disney&#39;s Muppets Most Wanted- A tale of combining the innocence of childhood with the white trash entertainment that undermines the destruction of the police force and horrible standards of prisons in America.</p>

<p><em>**Conan O&#39;Brian with one eye covered with an eye patch (referencing the all seeing eye) said, &quot;The NFL has no idea what it&#39;s in for... Unless it does(?)&quot;... Basically I took it like he was saying for those who know what to look for, you&#39;re right&quot; Though it could be misdirection. *</em>*</p>

<p>Sexually graphic yogurt commercial, &quot;fuel your pleasure&quot; people! Buy everything that makes you feel good and gets you hot chicks to lick questionable liquids off your pants.</p>

<p>Hidden Cameras reveal people are having fun and drinking, getting married, winning stuff, unaware they are being filmed.</p>

<p>Bud Light- &quot;Stay in the game, drink responsibly&quot;- AKA don&#39;t focus on the subliminal messages everywhere else.</p>

<p>***That Maserati commercial was uncanny. There&#39;s so much to interpret- if this is truly a message from the elite, I see it saying, &quot;You, the masses, are capable of destruction. You do have more power than you are aware of, but as you slowly grow in size your intelligence dwindles. As we continue to feed you garbage that makes you sloth-like in mind and body, we will wait and strike.&quot; &quot;We have prepared, now we strike.&quot; This is a tribute to those who are &quot;exactly the opposite of ordinary&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Superbowl should almost be a national holiday, people celebrating everywhere.&quot; </p>

<p>Halftime - Starts off with that word we&#39;ve heard recently, &quot;Prepare&quot;</p>

<p>Lot&#39;s of patriotism in all this, lots of reminders of supporting the troops, while repeating the word, &quot;prepare&quot;</p>

<p>Rednail64= possible shill, ignore him, all he is trying to do throughout this thread is give shotty excuses for well deserved ideas. </p>

<p>And submission history reveals he has one submission to this sub and more than 20 submissions to r/conspiratard. Case closed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone here actually watched the Super Bowl before? It is always larger than life. It always is very patriotic, this year perhaps more than normal as it&#39;s the first in New York in decades. The commercials are always over the top, and often cryptic to take advantage of the huge audience and social media activity. And the productions and announcers always pull out all the stops...which can lead to awkward moments and comments.</p>

<p>The Super Bowl is bizarre for a variety of reasons (like all entertainment), but some sort of blood ritual or false flag conditioning it is not. Also, no one is uncovering anything surprising here with the patriotism angle -- this has been standard practice in American sports for years.</p>

<p>Enjoy the game, folks.</p>

<p>So why do we watch TV? To entertain ourselves? What about books? what about chess? What about going outside and talking with other people? What happened to all of that? </p>

<p>All of this idiocy regarding the super bowl hits me harder because I didn&#39;t watch it. I can&#39;t believe some of my friends can sit through that shit.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t see people awakening, I see people are probably more dumb than ever. The thing with the Maserati commercial most people commented on was the fact that it was seemingly out of place for a super bowl ad, more along the lines of how many people watching are going to buy Maserati&#39;s? I didn&#39;t see too many people think that the commercial&#39;s context was weird unfortunately. </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m seeing is a &quot;now or never&quot; moment.  As in, we&#39;re coming to a crossroads where people will have to make a choice about what&#39;s going on around us, regardless of how awake they are.  I guess when I see people talking about that commercial at all, for whatever reason, it&#39;s like a very small victory, like &quot;Hey! People are asking questions at least...&quot;  I&#39;m probably overly optimistic, but it&#39;s how I stay sane lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, I will look those up and re-read those.</p>

<p>I agree, a lot of people agree, but the problem is they are still stuck inside the paradigm of left vs. right. Ethics vs. Government Regulation, Free Market vs Crony Capitalism. But in reality its more than that. Its a flaw of human character that is the root of the problem.</p>

<p>I do find people that are like a lot of people in this sub out in the wild, but its a rarity, and even then they aren&#39;t fully vested in the movement. I too have optimism, but i&#39;m afraid at the same time what a real revolution would bring. Its hard to stay sane sometimes, it really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see the commercial live, but I had a chance to check it out a few minutes ago and I think that you might be looking into it a bit too much. Maserati released the Ghibli III as a new addition to their line of executive sedans just recently in 2013. I think this is what they mean by &quot;We have prepared...&quot; 
I assume that the lines that the boy voices over (&quot;let them get huge, we&#39;ll stay small&quot;) could just reference that the car has a smaller engine than a comparable sports car such as Ferrari, who is known for their huge V12 engines, or even Lamborghini, who also favors a huge V10 engine. It&#39;s not impending doom, just a pretty turbocharged V6 pushing 410 hp!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To everyone saying the masserati spot was leading to something big about  the 1 per-centers crushing the souls of the us normal people, i think you should re-watch. yes its an awkward spot because you dont think the average superbowl viewer would be in its target demo, but the actual copy just tells the story of how the brand as been slowly doing its own thing waiting for the other high end brands to get complacent and predictable and then allow masserati to strike to gain more market share...my take on it at least after quick re watchings and some basic research </p>
