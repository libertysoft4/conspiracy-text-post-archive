<p>Horror as banker, 39, plunges to his death from headquarters of JP Morgan in Canary Wharf </p>

<p>A banker has died after jumping from the top of JP Morgan&#39;s headquarters in London this morning. The man, who is believed to be 39, fell from the 33 floor skyscraper and was found on the ninth floor roof of the Canary Wharf building. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 25 Bank Street just after 8am.</p>

<p>...And his name was Gabriel, or &quot;strong man of God,&quot; or &quot;God is my strength.&quot; <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/gabriel">Gabriel was one of the seven archangels in Hebrew tradition</a>. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the name of <em>thee</em> fallen angel again? <a href="http://www.sharefaith.com/guide/christian-ministries/angels/lucifer-the-fallen-angel.html">Lucifer</a>.</p>

<p>Who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjOs-egFMs">openly worships</a> the &quot;God of Earth,&quot; aka, Lucifer, in leveled rituals of enlightenment that go up to 33? Masons do. Only a small group of people make it to the 33rd degree.</p>

<p>What did George Washington say about his beloved Masonic tradition? <a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/library-congress-confirms-george-washington-aware-nefarious-illuminati/">It was literally being infiltrated by the Illuminati</a>.</p>

<p>Might this be some sort of warning to 33rd degree Masons to get out of the market now, because it&#39;s about to fall?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let&#39;s look at the facts.</p>

<p>So a banker named Gabriel (which is a fairly common name, like so many other names out of the Bible. Lucifer is far less common) decides to warn high-level Freemasons about... something (??) by committing suicide by leaping out of a specifically numbered floor. Let&#39;s examine, shall we?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">Gabriel often makes the list on the most common names in the United States and the UK.</a> Most Western names are Biblical / Roman / Christian. This is no more surprising or unusual than someone in the Middle East being named Mohammed. So are you saying that his parents knowingly named him after Lucifer, knowing that four decades later, he would commit suicide so that senior Freemasons would avoid unwise financial decisions?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_causes_of_death#Developed_vs._developing_economies">Suicide is the tenth most common cause of death.</a> Combined with the state of the economy and banking scandals and whatnot, again, this isn&#39;t too surprising.</p></li>
<li><p>The 33rd floor? Perhaps he-- I don&#39;t know-- WORKED there? </p></li>
<li><p>Why not send an encrypted email to senior Freemasons? A suicide is hardly an effective mode of secret communication, for fuck&#39;s sake.</p></li>
<li><p>Hey, maybe he committed suicide at eleven minutes past nine. DUN DUN DUN, that means he leapt to his death in order to warn the world that 9/11 was an inside job. The truth is out there, yo!</p></li>
<li><p>Has anyone looked into what kind of chemtrails were overhead? </p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s the license plate of the car he drove? Maybe if we rearrange them, it would spell out some more secret Freemason messages. Or something. </p></li>
<li><p>Has no one here even heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>? Cherry-picking and rearranging facts and figures to suit a pre-determined narrative is not exactly intelligent, nor skeptical, nor open-minded. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the plus side, several of you really should go into astrology, you have a natural talent for stringing together irrelevant facts to say something meaninglessly vague.</p>

<p>Their strategy isn&#39;t to stamp out the crime, it&#39;s to arrest the leaders, destroy the frame work of the organization and scatter the lesser pieces to the wind. That&#39;s what has happened to most terrorist groups, why the current &quot;threat&quot; is seemingly only from lone wolf types, because cells basically can&#39;t communicate without the feds knowing. </p>

<p>It also happened in Chicago, where the gang leaders were taken out but the conditions for territorial violence that remained just meant that gangs became small, unstable territories of as little as a couple of blocks, which has turned out to be far more volatile.</p>

<p>They employ similar strategies when infiltrating resistance groups like Anonymous or the Black Panthers (which is history this sub really needs to pay more attention to, it&#39;s who they honed their tactics on.)</p>

<p>Nothing would &quot;negate&quot; that &quot;fact&quot; for you. Nothing that anyone does could ever convince you otherwise. You have willingly accepted the least likely explanation for a series of relatively benign events and will continue to reinforce that thought in your own mind through subceptive mechanisms, fighting off cognitive dissonance at every opportunity. No amount of logic could budge you from such an illogical path, especially when you&#39;ve willingly and proudly pissed in the face of reason to reach such a path.

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t believe the NSA had much to do with the creation of Bitcoin. I do not doubt they have an interest in it for both identification, tracing, and encryption-wise. Again, that doesn&#39;t meant they are responsible for it.</p>

<p>At this point I feel that the government and respective agencies are watching Bitcoin&#39;s rise and know they need to be somewhat preemptive. Being that Bitcoin is inherently difficult to trace, they want to funnel people into using payment providers that they can trace/monitor.</p>

<p>So it makes sense they would say &quot;Bitcoin is okay, but you have to use provider XYZ&quot; (think Visa, MasterCard, Discover). This way they have a centralized system which actually undermines the Bitcoin itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. All these approval pieces in Forbes and other online news sites like the Wall Street Journal and USA today worry me about the Gov&#39;t&#39;s willingness for it to prosper.  </p>

<p>But its a sound piece of code. Everyone has been studying it for a long time and see no initial flaws in it. Unless the NSA has a computer that can crack the SHA=256 encryption instantly(and they probably do), then why worry.  The great thing about bitcoin is it can not be created within the system. Unlike the dollar which can be created from nothing. </p>

<p>Looks like the dollar is starting to crumble and bitcoin will shine very brightly. Lets see what happens in the next year or so. </p>

<p>What was Thornton &amp; Tomasetti also involved with? The tear down and disposal of the 9/11 towers evidence AND in charge of the contractors for the WTC renovations prior to the 9/11 attacks. If anyone knew of unauthorized contractors planting nano-thermites with paint, construction materials or conventional means it would be this firm.</p>

<p>Read the first paragraph at least. T&amp;T got the blame for destroying most of the 9/11 evidence that got shipped off to China and scrap yards. They were the lead engineering firm in charge of contracting out the work and made the decisions.</p>

<p>I could dig deeper but its already apparent those involved with 9/11 have their hands all over the new stadium and this years Superbowl event.</p>

<p>Coincidence or clues for an upcoming false flag? Just think of the opportunity if a event like the SB was &quot;attacked&quot;. Justification to take away any rights that remain and the American people will eat it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About a year or so ago, someone from the bank in Sienna (I think the oldest bank in the world) also committed &quot;suicide&quot; by jumping off of a roof.  Then a couple of years ago, someone from the Fed was found hanging in his basement -- supposedly also suicide.  I am wondering if there is a pattern here.  If there is anything irregular in the banking practices (and we know there is a lot!), and they are found out by middle-upper level employees.  If the employees make their concerns known, they could be asking for a noose around the neck.   Now I know this sounds like a conspiracy (so surely this is a good place to post) but 4 dead bankers by suicide in about 4 years is odd, I think -- also, there may be more.  There was also that guy affiliated with the Vatican bank who was found in Thames river, very close to a Morgan gold vault.  At the very least, these incidents deserve further investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let&#39;s look at the facts.</p>

<p>So a banker named Gabriel (which is a fairly common name, like so many other names out of the Bible. Lucifer is far less common) decides to warn high-level Freemasons about... something (??) by committing suicide by leaping out of a specifically numbered floor. Let&#39;s examine, shall we?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">Gabriel often makes the list on the most common names in the United States and the UK.</a> Most Western names are Biblical / Roman / Christian. This is no more surprising or unusual than someone in the Middle East being named Mohammed. So are you saying that his parents knowingly named him after Lucifer, knowing that four decades later, he would commit suicide so that senior Freemasons would avoid unwise financial decisions?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_causes_of_death#Developed_vs._developing_economies">Suicide is the tenth most common cause of death.</a> Combined with the state of the economy and banking scandals and whatnot, again, this isn&#39;t too surprising.</p></li>
<li><p>The 33rd floor? Perhaps he-- I don&#39;t know-- WORKED there? </p></li>
<li><p>Why not send an encrypted email to senior Freemasons? A suicide is hardly an effective mode of secret communication, for fuck&#39;s sake.</p></li>
<li><p>Hey, maybe he committed suicide at eleven minutes past nine. DUN DUN DUN, that means he leapt to his death in order to warn the world that 9/11 was an inside job. The truth is out there, yo!</p></li>
<li><p>Has anyone looked into what kind of chemtrails were overhead? </p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s the license plate of the car he drove? Maybe if we rearrange them, it would spell out some more secret Freemason messages. Or something. </p></li>
<li><p>Has no one here even heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>? Cherry-picking and rearranging facts and figures to suit a pre-determined narrative is not exactly intelligent, nor skeptical, nor open-minded. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the plus side, several of you really should go into astrology, you have a natural talent for stringing together irrelevant facts to say something meaninglessly vague.</p>
