        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My suggestion is to stick to indisputable facts. Some examples...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satam_al-Suqami#Attacks">Satam al-Suqami&#39;s passport found</a> unscathed when not even a black box could be recovered. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/19/september11.iraq%20regarding%20the%20suspiciously%20convenient%20recovery%20of%20said%20passport.">(Relevant article from The Guardian</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>An unusually large amount of put options betting that American Airlines and United Airlines would go down just days before 9/11 resulting in someone or some people from profiting an estimated $5 million (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/profiting-from-disaster/">CBS article from September 19th, 2001</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Former Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y">testimony under oath to the 9/11 commission</a> that Dick Cheney knowingly refused to let the scrambled NORAD jets take down American Airlines flight 77 that hit the Pentagon (which, ironically, was hit right where the accounting offices had been moved to just months prior that were investigating $2.3 trillion that was missing from the DoD&#39;s budget, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU4GdHLUHwU#t=51">reported by Donald Rumsfeld himself</a>, on <strong>September 10th, 2001</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know there are many more that you guys can think of. Lets try and make a database with short synopses of the topics being discussed so people don&#39;t have to sit through a 2 hour video or read a 30 page article. </p>

<p>Also important: <strong>Please</strong> avoid talking about missiles painted like an American Airlines plane, holograms or other things that can never be proven. The point is to just poke holes in the logic, not to totally convince someone that private actors were responsible and no one will be willing to think about 9/11 differently if you talk about things that are impossible to prove. The object is to get people to look up things on their own, so give them interesting things to look up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about the fact that asbestos removal was going to cost more than tearing the buildings down. </p>

<p>Also its really conveinent that all the building seem to have fallen directly in their own foot prints, at free fall speed, without leaving much of a trace on the seismographs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpiVv8tQdmY&amp;amp;t=191m15s">The fact that the buildings fell at freefall acceleration says it all.</a> In my opinion this is the only fact we should be focusing on because you simply cannot argue with it. </p>

<p>The 3 buildings collapsed straight down at freefall acceleration. There was no resistance on the way down. If it &#39;pancaked&#39; we&#39;d see resistance for a second or two as the floor below resists the collapse above. But we didn&#39;t see that. It all came down in one smooth motion.</p>

<p>No one can argue with this. This is simple physics. This is a fact. This is what everyone saw with their own eyes. When you start getting into the who what where when and how, it becomes easy for those who believe the official story to selectively pick out inconsistencies to protect their ego and their world view.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bIvkgxlaGQ">NIST themselves have now admitted that the building fell at freefall.</a> Come on, it doesn&#39;t get any simpler than this.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what happens when Jet fuel burns out of control. It&#39;s nearly impossible to put out, and burns for a super long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that. It&#39;s interesting that I keep reading here that all &quot;the jet fuel would have burned up almost instantly&quot; from people, but that looked very tricky to put out, even when those guys could walk right up to it, which of course was impossible during 9/11.</p>

<p>This man is telling the truth and trying to get the word out to the population...Google search this: Van full of explosives 9/11... And see what comes up, the media covered the story of the vans on 9/11 that were full of explosives and one of the vans was parked under the George Washington Bridge..Happened to be Israelis that worked for Israeli Mossad that got caught but days later it was never mentioned EVER again, the FBI had them in custody for 74 days and they all failed polygraph tests and were secretly released back to Israel by the Bush Administration.. The Israeli Mossad agents had a company (front company) called urban moving systems that was located in Weehawken, NJ.. 9/11 was a false flag operation planned and carried out by western intelligence agencies (CIA, Mossad) and elements withen the Bush administration/pentagon with the use of the Zionist owned media to spread propaganda to the population... 9/11 was a inside/outside job....Israeli Mossad was behind 9/11 with the help of the neocons and Zionists and Dick Cheney ordered Norad/Air force to stand down, why do you people think not one Jet fighter was there to stop the Hijackers?.. The Hijackers were real and were allowed to hijack the planes..﻿The Hijackings were cover to make it look like the planes caused the buildings to come down, but in reality it was controlled demolition..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a personal list of things I&#39;ve jotted down from time to time, that have bothered me over the years (some more than others):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Black Boxes - Page 456, item 76, 9/11 Commission Report - Flight American 11 and United 175 never founds, Flight 77 not recoverable</p></li>
<li><p>Data recorder serial #&#39;s for Flights 77 and 93 never published</p></li>
<li><p>WTC 7 - 1st Steel Building to collapse from fire</p></li>
<li><p>WTC 7 never mentioned (at all) in 9/11 Commission report</p></li>
<li><p>Majority of debris was destroyed and sold for scrap.  Why the rush?</p></li>
<li><p>BBC Video report and others mention WTC 7 collapse ~15 minutes before it happened  (as if the script was sent to early)</p></li>
<li><p>Larry Silverstein -  Building owner, on record using the term &quot;pull&quot; in regards to talking about his conversation with FD on taking down WTC7.  &quot;they would have to pull it&quot;  (How was this possible?)</p></li>
<li><p>Bush on record referencing &quot;explosives&quot;, in his explanation of what he saw on TV.  Also I believe he references incorrectly seeing the first plane hit on TV, which didn&#39;t actually occur on air.  </p></li>
<li><p>No plane was intercepted by airforce, first time ever, and 4 targets missed.  (Unless 93 was, and just never publicly stated)</p></li>
<li><p>Arlen Spector, &quot;JFK magic bullet/single bullet&quot;, same guy appointed to &quot;911 Joint Intelligence Committee&quot; (Some have a credibility issue with Mr Spector)</p></li>
<li><p>At Pentagon, there are many different accounts of the flight path from eye-witness testimony</p></li>
<li><p>At Pentagon, complete lack of any video or photo evidence showing the incident.  Besides the ground security, there are various hotel and gas stations that had their footage collected.  Never released anything but 3-4 frames from a parking lot gate camera.</p></li>
<li><p>The odd perfect round hole on the far interior wall of the Pentagon, yet no plane parts or anything around it.</p></li>
<li><p>The cab driver hit by the downed light pole at the pentagon.  The man has an odd story to tell, very early on, before the conspiracy train really got going.</p></li>
<li><p>Record of insider trading of Airline stock/options</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that George Bush Sr. was a former CIA director</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that we went to war with Iraq, yet the enemy was Al Qaeda / Osama</p></li>
<li><p>Various accounts of certain individuals being warned about flying on 9/11</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the towers both fell</p></li>
<li><p>NORAD Drills were run just prior to 9/11.  Traffic Controller audio tape confusion as to if this is a drill or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Found Passports and speed with which we were able to pull together the list of terrorists</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some things I do believe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We live in a world where it is harder and harder to know what is &quot;true&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>A plane hit the 2nd building.  A trusted friend saw the event from a near building&#39;s roof while looking at the first tower.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ll never really know what happened</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s important to keep putting salt in this wound.  It&#39;s the only way as a nation and as a people to get through this and reconcile the past.</p></li>
</ul>
