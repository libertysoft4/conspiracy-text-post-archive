<blockquote>
<p>The spiral of silence is a political science and mass communication theory propounded by the German political scientist Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann. Spiral of silence theory describes the process by which one opinion becomes dominant as those who perceive their opinion to be in the minority do not speak up because society threatens individuals with fear of isolation. The assessment of one&#39;s social environment may not always be correct with reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At various times, under its own authority or in accordance with directives from the President of the United States or the National Security Council staff, the Central Intelligence Agency has attempted to influence domestic and international public opinion, and sometimes law enforcement. This article does not address, other than incidental to influencing opinion or actions reasonably associated with CIA security, possibly illegal domestic surveillance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operation Mockingbird was a secret campaign by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to influence media. Begun in the 1950s, it was initially organized by Cord Meyer and Allen W. Dulles, it was later led by Frank Wisner after Dulles became the head of the CIA. The organization recruited leading American journalists into a network to help present the CIA&#39;s views, and funded some student and cultural organizations, and magazines as fronts. As it developed, it also worked to influence foreign media and political campaigns, in addition to activities by other operating units of the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are hundreds if not thousands of disparate groups all functioning with their own agenda. It is outright ignorance to think there is a &quot;they&quot; that oversees all. If there was, don&#39;t you think the world would be much different? Paranoid much? Even the UN is a do-nothing dysfunctional load of rubbish.</p>

<p>Also and straight out of the article you just posted there&#39;s this in the very first paragraph:
&quot;The structure of the control network of transnational corporations affects global market competition and financial stability. So far, only small national samples were studied and there was no appropriate methodology to assess control globally&quot;</p>

<p>Do you even read these things or do you just fall prey to your own paranoia? God almighty. I&#39;m completely ok with the fact that there are conspiracies at play, of course there are. But when they are attributed to overarching &quot;They&quot;, the credibility of each and all is diminished because to do so demonstrates a complete lack of critical thinking.</p>

This quote was supposedly recorded by Mae Brussell.
She talked about it a few times on her radio show in the late 80&#39;s.
All her shows are transcribed online.
To better ascertain why this is posted here you might find researching the life and death of William Casey to your benefit.</p>

Is William Casey capable of this quote? Yes, this is the guy who admitted in affidavit that the CIA did in fact import/sell cocaine and a slew of other crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still just a rumor to me. A <a href="http://www.maebrussell.com/Bibliography%20Sheets/842s2.html">few years ago</a> I tried to track down the rumor that aspartame was once listed on &quot;an inventory of prospective biochemical warfare weapons submitted to Congress. Admirably, the Mae Brussell show where this was supposedly discussed had a <a href="http://www.maebrussell.com/Bibliography%20Sheets/842s2.html">bibliography sheet</a>, but the sources that I was able to track down did not say that anywhere.</p>

<p>Just last week somebody posted a quote from George H.W. Bush, which supposedly appeared in the June, 1992 Sarah McClendon Newsletter. I&#39;ve researched that one before and found that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vy6im/if_the_people_were_to_ever_find_out_what_we_have/cex193a">there were three issues of the Sarah McClendon newsletter in June, 1992 and the quote is not in any of them</a>.</p>

<p>Was this from an interview with Casey? Or is it just somebody on her show stating that Casey said this? What was the context?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The quote and story is interesting but it is odd how it cropped up lately when it is just a tiny sliver of what Casey&#39;s boys were really up to down at the CIA HQ. It&#39;s good that the quote is causing researchers to look deeper into Casey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are hundreds if not thousands of disparate groups all functioning with their own agenda. It is outright ignorance to think there is a &quot;they&quot; that oversees all. If there was, don&#39;t you think the world would be much different? Paranoid much? Even the UN is a do-nothing dysfunctional load of rubbish.</p>

<p>Also and straight out of the article you just posted there&#39;s this in the very first paragraph:
&quot;The structure of the control network of transnational corporations affects global market competition and financial stability. So far, only small national samples were studied and there was no appropriate methodology to assess control globally&quot;</p>

<p>Do you even read these things or do you just fall prey to your own paranoia? God almighty. I&#39;m completely ok with the fact that there are conspiracies at play, of course there are. But when they are attributed to overarching &quot;They&quot;, the credibility of each and all is diminished because to do so demonstrates a complete lack of critical thinking.</p>
