I&#39;m having my first child, a daughter, in the next week or so (according to the doctors) and I am curious about vaccines.  I know that the hepatitis B vaccine is mandatory unless I opt out of it, but I want to know WHY I should opt out of it.  I&#39;ve heard the pro side, now I want to hear the con side.  Same goes for all other vaccines, why shouldn&#39;t I get my baby vaccinated?  My partner is all aboard to have this baby vaccinated but I&#39;m not so sure, what information can i give her to make her think a little bit?  Any help you guys can offer would be great.</p>

<p>ETA:  If anyone has some good websites or anyone I can get in touch with, that would be helpful.  The doctors and my partner are really pushing for vaccinating, but I&#39;m so on the fence!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it was common knowledge that Andrew Wakefield&#39;s &quot;research&quot; linking vaccines with autism is fraudulent? </p>

<p>Frankly I think it&#39;s ridiculous to not vaccinate your child. Measles is a good example- it&#39;s highly contagious and potentially life-threatening, as well as completely preventable. It&#39;s also irresponsible to assume your child would never come in contact with these diseases, they are quite common and becoming increasingly more widespread in places where parents have the same vaccine phobia as you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the opposition in this argument is their opinions are not backed up by reality.  If they get their information from Google U not google scholar, chances are its shaky.</p>

<p>The facts are:<br/>
* Vaccine preventable diseases such as pertussis (whopping cough), measles, etc. are on the rise, and they are rising most quickly in areas where people are turning down vaccines.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>one</strong> study that found any link between vaccines and autism was about as fraudulent as it gets.  </p></li>
<li><p>Vaccines are effective, but no they aren&#39;t 100% effective.  Nothing ever is 100% effective. But something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">heard immunity</a> protects those in whom the vaccine failed, or who cannot be vaccinate (like people with cancer, or transplant patients).</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccines are safe. However, there are always side effects of any medication.  No drug, effective home remedy, or the like will be totally free of side effects.  Hell nothing in this world is 100% safe.  The question becomes would you want your kids to experience the joy of whopping cough, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3oZrMGDMMw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">here&#39;s a video of a child with it</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Even prior to thimerosal being removed from most vaccines, you&#39;d get a bigger dose of mercury by eating a can of tuna than you&#39;d get from all the vaccines you&#39;d ever receive.</p></li>
<li><p>A vaccination, or a large number of vaccinations is not a huge insult to your kids immune system.  From the moment the child leaves the sterile environment of the womb, he or she will be exposed to millions if not trillions of potentially infectious bacteria, viruses, and yeasts. So small amount of protein from the target of the vaccine is not going to overwhelm them. In fact, that small amount of protein may save their lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccines are not money machines for big Pharma.  In fact in most cases they&#39;re money sinks.  Most of the money pharma makes is off of depressed horny old people.  They make their money off of anti-depressents, boner pills, blood pressure and cholesterol meds. Not vaccines (or antibiotics).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Make your own decisions, we live in a free country (at the moment), but you have to understand the chance you&#39;re taking on your child&#39;s behalf.  The diseases that we vaccinate against are not pretty, their killers, and just because we&#39;ve held them in check with vaccines does not mean they&#39;ve grown any less deadly.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve said my peace, enjoy down voting it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Jewish so I always just use that as an excuse to opt out of vaccines. (Even though I&#39;m atheist) I&#39;m sure this would suffice. They might offer kosher variations, so you&#39;ll then have to say your religious convictions go deeper than this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that literally everything you encounter on a daily basis, including your honey and apple cider vinegar are chemicals right?  The only thing we interact with that isn&#39;t chemical is light.</p>

<p>You may be conflating synthetic with natural.  But buddy let me tell you just because something is synthetic does NOT make it harmful, nor does &quot;natural&quot;=wonderful.  Simple example:  Azithromycin is a synthetic antibiotic, which saves numerous lives a year.  However, arsenic, nightshade, scopolamine, psilocybin, and cyanide are all 100% natural. And they will kill you good, even at very low doses.</p>

<p>There are naturopathic remedies that are effective, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypericum_perforatum">St. John&#39;s wort</a>, which can work as an antidepressent, but that&#39;s because its active ingrediant is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor">MAOIs</a> are old antidepressants, and can have lethal drung/drug and drug/diet interactions.  Because of this they&#39;re a last line drug when others fail.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts on the matter, for what they are worth:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Vaccination does sometimes cause serious and even life-threatening problems. It can in some cases cause death. This is not disputed by doctors or scientists. What they say is that the <em>potential</em> good of vaccination outweighs the potential bad. But does it?</p></li>
<li><p>The reality is, most of the diseases that are vaccinated against are quite rare in the industrialized, advanced West. Now, maybe this is the result of mass vaccination, or maybe it is the result of better sanitary practices. The reality remains the same -- a child is very unlikely to contract the diseases for which it is vaccinated, if it remains unvaccinated.</p></li>
<li><p>So you need to weigh the risks. There is a very slight chance that if you do not vaccinate your baby, she will contract one of the life-threatening diseases she would otherwise have been vaccinated against. We&#39;re not concerned with things such as flu, which are not life-threatening. Who cares about the childhood diseases such as mumps, measles and so on that all children used to get as a matter of course, and survived just fine? We&#39;re talking about really life-threatening diseases the child is likely to contract, and those are very, very, very rare in today&#39;s society. On the other hand, there is a very real risk that your baby could be harmed by the vaccination process itself, by suffering one of the numerous side effects of mass vaccination at an early age.</p></li>
<li><p>In my opinion, the practical danger to a child getting a life-threatening disease while living a decent lifestyle in the United States, or any other wealthy Western nation for that matter, is remote. I&#39;m talking about a really killer disease, I&#39;m not talking a disease that sometimes kills a small number of people, such as flu or measles. Any disease can kill people, if they are weak enough or vulnerable enough to begin with. I consider the dangers posed by the side effects of vaccines to be <em>greater</em> than the dangers posed by the diseases those vaccinations are supposed to prevent.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>The general form of your argument makes sense - it is certainly in theory possible for a vaccination&#39;s negative effects to be more dangerous than the risk associated with a disease.  Small pox vaccination for example would make no sense - the vaccination itself is dangerous and small pox is an extinct disease.</p>

<p>For vaccinations used in the west however serious or life threatening side effects are extremely rare.  Mild side effects are common but less serious than the effects of contracting disease vaccinated against.  People look at the risk benefit and cost effectiveness of particular vaccinations before they approved, they are not just randomly put onto the market.</p>
