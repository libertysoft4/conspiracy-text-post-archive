    <div class="md"><p>No its just their equipment will be most likely based on visible light.  Infrared light will throw it off base.</p>

<p>I used to get weird lights in the sky and on the ground outside my house that I think were time travelers popping in and out of their created wormholes.  I have surrounded my house with infrared lights and since then I haven&#39;t seen the lights or strange occurrences.  I believe it is an effective tool in disrupting their technology.</p>

<p>Ok, so say you can time travel and end up on earth no matter what point in time you travel to... If I chose to go back 50 million years... my portal opens on top of a mountain in my current time...50 million years ago, that mountain was not there...I step through to the other side of the portal...what happens? I fall right?</p>

<p>There is no being open minded about it. Time travel is not possible. If it were, we&#39;d be living in a utopian society right now. The one world government would have already been set up and running hundreds, if nto thousands of years ago. Any uprisings would have been retroactively put down. Your logic is flawed.

<p>You are saying if we had time travel tech they would just go back and fix everything.  This is false logic.  A utopia is not attainable and government control with fear is.  Bad things need to happen for the government to advance its goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does make some sense but even so the people who believe in the NWO aren&#39;t a large entity by any means. Without resources how can 1 thwart a group that rules the world?</p>

<p>Without proper intel it would be near impossible to identify someone who is  a part of the NWO. The only real factor seems to be money and or Jewish. I&#39;m not even how one could get intel and verify its authenticity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally see a bit of possibility to Project Pegasus, but not enough to warrant much more than casual speculation. We just don&#39;t have enough evidence that time travel is possible, yet. I have no doubt that we will be able to perform feats such as time travel in the future, though.
If the NWO were able to time travel, I think that we would definitely have more evidence of their actions throughout history; and they would also be MUCH better at covering up their tracks in the present time.
Would you care to elaborate on the Titanic theory, though, OP? To be perfectly honest, I have been considering time travel as a possibility, but am getting nowhere with it. I will definitely say that I feel as though the narrative of history (and ancient history) is VERY skewed. Whether this has anything to do with time travel or not, I have no idea.</p>

He implied it&#39;s the true purpose of CERN (for those who paid for it anyway), but I disagree; they are after an antimatter weapon, though time travel could easily be a by-product of that. If Titor is legit, your lights do nothing.</p>
