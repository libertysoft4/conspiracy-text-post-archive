<p>According to Rosin, von Braun also spoke of the existence of &quot;Off Planet Cultures&quot; (extraterrestrials) and about how these OPC&#39;s are going to be identified as being &quot;enemies,&quot; when they are not enemies</p>

Aliens may not be able to transport enough equipment across the stars to crush us without destroying the Earth ecosystem. In which case they can try to establish a global totalitarian government under their hidden control.</p>

<p>No matter what an alien would want to take from us, It&#39;s possible to replicate/grow/create with technology a LOT less sophisticated than the science used to travel at (presumed) FTL speeds.</p>

<p>Need water?  </p>

<p>Europa has 100 mile deep oceans and nobody to fight.</p>

<p>Just want to destroy Earth? </p>

<p>Accelerate a 2km iron asteroid to 80% c and the collision is close to the binding energy. No guns or loss of life on their end.</p>

<p>Need food? </p>

<p>They can grow it elsewhere and just copy the DNA found here.</p>

<p>Want to flush out humans so you can live here? </p>

<p>Use a low-tech (from their POV) nano-virus and kill all 7billion in a few days/weeks by spreading everywhere.</p>

<p>People really need to learn to think big. If there is a type 2/3 civilization out there, they are either peaceful or they will use the above.</p>

<p>There will be no warning of an attack . You and all 7billion would just be dead.</p>

Good point, they could pretty much do anything huh?
Or wait a minute, what if their needs and plans were so advanced and otherworldly that one human twit who thinks he knows everything may not be able to comprehend it? 
Nah, i bet your right..
Well i bet you believe youre right...
Well, i bet you believe youre right just as much as your fuckheaded ancestors &quot;knew&quot; the world was flat..
So you &quot;know&quot; this. 
Just like i know that the moment i think i know something, i have then put a mental roadblock up, and am preventing myself from learning more on the subject. Hmm wait, maybe we shouldnt claim to know anything, and just keep a running probability of ideas thats constantly growing and evolving....
Nah, would waste all of our textbooks... Ya, you just keep reading those little buddy, report what you find back to us so we dont get lost thinking about our crazy &quot;round world&quot; theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read Report from Iron Mountain on the Possibility and Desirability of Peace then you will see that people have thought all about how to waste money.  You can also see how this line of thought is very prevalent with the elites when you read words written by Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman.  For the elites the economy is a simple matter in that they only need to keep us convinced that we need to spend massive amounts of money on large wasteful projects.</p>

<p>However, if one government were to waste all of its money on completely meaningless work then it could be overrun by competiting powers who have spent most of their money on the military.  So if/until there is a world government then military expenditures will be the preferred method of waste.  Later when everything is unified they are open to the possiblitiy of wasting lots of money on a wide variety of other things.  So this rationality is how the elites can proceed to gain complete control of everything.  In their minds once they do this then they can eliminate war.  In the meantime they need to engage in lots of warlike activity to build this better future.  You can see how they could become rather conflicted and turn to massive self-deception over their ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hardly.  They are the biggest threats to life on the planet and NOTHING is spent on finding ways to deal with them.  Just tossing in MSM as a phrase on an issue they won&#39;t touch with a bargepole normally just makes you look like a flake. r/conspiracy does not have to equal r/flake.  And there are enough libtard democrat-republican or zionist Anti-Zionist tribalist trolls being flakey enough as it is. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t global warming or other such crap.   We only found out four months ago that in september - december 2013 we will be passing a meteor that is about 6 miles long - the same size as the one that got the dinosaurs.  Tomorrow we might discover one that we aren&#39;t just going to pass relatively close by in a years time but are going to collide with.  The one that exploded before it hit Russia with ten times the shockwave of Hiroshima was under 50 feet long.</p>

<p>If this meteor doesn&#39;t disintegrate when it passes the sun and its gravity you will have two months of it in the sky (brighter than the moon) day and night in which to reconsider your view that it is just the MSM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those meteor statistics are based on us actually taking an interest in dealing with those threats.  The nonsense about inter-human struggle is actually zero.  The probability of those who think these are important causing an extinction is not zero though.  Zero.  Not Zero.</p>

<p>I stand by my view that you are just trying to transplant opposition to the MIC to anything else that might get in between you and money for booze, cool shit etc and it isn&#39;t being transplanted as there is nothing mutually exclusive about space and earth.  It&#39;s just a chancer in a rage that would argue that there was. </p>

<p>If you think that wars can&#39;t possibly destroy the humankind you&#39;re an absolute idiot. We have never stopped fighting each other through millennia of recorded history. We&#39;re not long term rational.</p>

<p>Just have a look at the current conflict between Iran (with enormous Russian and Chinese investments ) and NATO-baked Israel.</p>

<p>Biotech and AI will put into human hands weapons far more capable than nukes. What&#39;s the probability of accidents, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov</a> .</p>

<p>Through history there were always people who thought they were Gods, or God chosen. These days they may get access to the means to destroy the inferiors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is irrelevant.  All of these are within human beings ability to control if they want.  This does not apply to meteors.  There is a difference.  And, again, there is no mutual exclusivity in the world coming together in an attempt to protect itself from something it has no power over at the moment and the world throwing away all the petty things that will only destroy it the worlds inhabitants are at  each others throats.</p>

<p>You take the rose coloured glasses off.  The idea that there might be a global crisis is gauranteed to bring out of the sewers all the scumbag interest groups looking for money for booze or some equivalent.  Global warming activists for example are utterly freaking out at the idea of meteors threatening life and are even trying to have meteors classified as space weather - a subgroup within global warming groups.   Others haven&#39;t wised up to this yet and are just lashing out in a rage at everybody the way they have been trained to.</p>

<p>It talks about a false flag alien invasion event that is being planned by TPTB. Of course there&#39;s no way to 100% trust this information, but it&#39;s interesting nonetheless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pointed this out yesterday in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18kfad/could_this_rock_that_hit_in_russia_an_hour_or_so/">this thread</a>. I was surprised to see I was downvoted quite a bit (I thought this was <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>??)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll post it again here, perhaps it will get better reception. Thanks for pointing this out OP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_rosin">Carol Rosin</a>, who was the spokesperson for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gce1KB6co-w">Werner von Braun</a>, before he died the infamous ex-Nazi rocket scientist warned that a serious of threats would be used by the military industrial complex in order to justify building space-based weapons. </p>

<p>Rosin claims von Braun said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The strategy that Wernher Von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are going to be considered to be the enemy. In fact, in 1974, they were the enemy, the identified enemy. We were told that they had &quot;killer satellites&quot;. We were told that they were coming to get us and control us -- that they were &quot;Commies.&quot;</p>

<p>Then terrorists would be identified, and that was soon to follow. We heard a lot about terrorism. Then we were going to identify third-world country &quot;crazies.&quot; We now call them Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the third enemy against whom we would build space-based weapons.</p>

<p>The next enemy was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. Asteroids--against asteroids we are going to build space-based weapons.</p>

<p>And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials. That would be the final scare.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah, you&#39;d be surprised how lucrative this business is...any justification for more and more weaponry is on the table, even using asteroids and an &quot;alien&quot; threat.</p>

<p>I also just heard that they&#39;re saying this is the largest explosion since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">Tunguska event</a> in 1908. That immediately caught my attention, because it&#39;s well known in the alternative research community that Tesla may have been involved in causing the Tunguska event.</p>

<p>FTA: &quot;Oliver Nichelson suggested that the Tunguska explosion may have been the result of an experiment by Nikola Tesla using the Wardenclyffe Tower, performed during one of Admiral Robert Peary&#39;s North Pole expeditions.&quot;</p>

<p>So if the only thing they can compare this to was an explosion that may have been artificial, that definitely raises the possibility, however slight, that this event could have a similar artificial nature.</p>

<p>Also, I just heard on NPR that some Russian official is saying that this was a US attack.</p>

<p>In the land of conspiracy theory, anything is possible :D</p>
