    <div class="md"><p>Was he on camera murdering someone?  That&#39;s the only thing that would even <em>maybe</em> hold up as evidence in all of what you said.  </p>

<p>When you present evidence, it has to actually stand up to scrutiny.  That&#39;s supposedly why we have trials to begin with - both sides can present evidence, and it&#39;s up to the other side to demonstrate problems with that evidence.  Then the jury makes decisions about guilt based on that, and the judge makes a sentencing decision.  The police in this case skipped that entire process, and apparently just burnt him alive - something that&#39;s not supposed to happen in this country at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny to me that the same people clamoring for transparency and truth use this kind of rhetoric. Let&#39;s break down what you really just said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You must think it&#39;s perfectly fine that police officers get to ruin peoples lives on a whim, with no repercussions&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implying that I think unchecked police corruption is a good thing. No, I don&#39;t. There obviously is problem with this and I&#39;m sure a lot of instances go unpunished and this needs to improve. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As soon as someone decides to do something about it, then you have a problem.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as someone decides to do <strong>something</strong>. An interesting word choice to minimize the significance of murdering people. Do I have a problem when people do something about it? No. It&#39;s not a justification for murder, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go back to your hypocritical bunker. So the police &quot;murdered&quot; this guy according to your standards, which is completely unacceptable, but the fact that he murdered people is morally justifiable since it fit some personal code of his (based on actions yet to be confirmed nor denied) that you happen to fall in line with? Seems legit. So whenever someone has a legitimate gripe they should kill people to bring attention to it and when they are gunned down in the process of their spree they should be regarded as a martyr for the cause. </p>

<p>Wow, violence gets things to the forefront. Surprise. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only method to do so - especially in this age of technology - and to suggest that is short sighted and ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the manhunt the cops shot three people who don&#39;t even remotely look like the guy but were guilty of driving trucks that were somewhat similar.  Nutball or not, Dorner accused the LAPD of sloppy police work and not taking the lives or rights of citizens seriously, and these were perfect examples of each.  He also accused officers of acting as if they are above the law.  If they indeed decided to burn him alive rather than take him into custody then they proved him right again.</p>

He was supposed to be judged by a group of his peers before getting executed, and this is why I am pissed about this. This is evidence of police being able to execute without trial, and we have had evidence of police framing people. What this now gives us is the possibility of police framing people to execute them without trial (not that it wasn&#39;t possible before, but it&#39;s actually accepted by the people now).</p>

If you listen to the scanner audio, before the &quot;burners are deployed&quot;, they make mention of opening up a hole in the 1,2 wall. They also mention blood splatter in a corner. My theory is that they got him, then went in with the bunker buster or something and made holes to look around and saw that there may be booby traps and decided to burn it all down to be safe assuming Dorner set explosives to cause as much carnage as possible. </p>

<p>I mean put yourself in a responding officers shoes, this guy just killed one of your friends you work with, he&#39;s shot other people you know and now he&#39;s shooting at you. it&#39;s no surprise to me they burned that building to the ground. And who are we to say it wasn&#39;t the right way? is it right to take him to court? have people relive the devastation and horror he caused, have to look him face to face and testify against him? you think he would he seriously have a fair trial? a black man pegged as a cop killer i doubt would get a fair trial. i&#39;d like to be proved wrong but i don&#39;t see that happening</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so what were they supposed to do genius? keep engaging in deadly shoot outs and risk more people being killed? you have to remember dorner was an expert marksman. those cops i bet are no where on his level. so how else do you get this guy out of the house, when he is surrounded? light that shit on fire. he can come out and get apprehended or wait inside and see whats going to happen. seriously though, what is the correct way of capturing someone holed up in a house? especially when they have deadly force and the means to carry it out? it is not a conspiracy it is simple logic. 99% of people would&#39;ve rushed out of that house. he&#39;s crazy and on a murderous rampage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get the apc to break the wall since it wont be penetrated by small arms. Have snipers in the woods just in case dorner gets an opportunity to do something crazy. Have everyone wearing mandible protectors on kevlar. Send in team to clear entry point, if booby trapped the apc could most likely take it out and withstand any side effects(suck for the driver) even before entry team goes in. Once in clear room have second team come up surrounding and putting in blocking positions paying close attention to exit points (doors, windows). Have third team come in and clear next room, effectively leap frogging every room. Have apc ready to take down any room. Once target is located. Flashbang the fuck out of the room along with a coordinated assault from the non lethal weapon system that shoots audiowaves with immense power to dissorient target(big cities have these in their arsenal, lapd couldve provided one.) Take target down if he wont surrender but then you have positive I.d. on target at least. But I mean burning the motherfucker is way easier</p>

<p>Total exaggeration. Implying that any time the police use lethal force on a suspect who presents a threat of bodily harm they would be &quot;executing&quot; them. Learn 2 logic. </p>

Exaggeration? Hardly. If you wanna believe that they had no choice but to set the house on fire and kill him; rather than take him alive, then you either have no knowledge of what tactics and weapons they had at their disposal, or are blatantly disregarding their other options.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the manhunt the cops shot three people who don&#39;t even remotely look like the guy but were guilty of driving trucks that were somewhat similar.  Nutball or not, Dorner accused the LAPD of sloppy police work and not taking the lives or rights of citizens seriously, and these were perfect examples of each.  He also accused officers of acting as if they are above the law.  If they indeed decided to burn him alive rather than take him into custody then they proved him right again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go back to your hypocritical bunker. So the police &quot;murdered&quot; this guy according to your standards, which is completely unacceptable, but the fact that he murdered people is morally justifiable since it fit some personal code of his (based on actions yet to be confirmed nor denied) that you happen to fall in line with? Seems legit. So whenever someone has a legitimate gripe they should kill people to bring attention to it and when they are gunned down in the process of their spree they should be regarded as a martyr for the cause. </p>
