<p><strong>an excerpt</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mia Farrow said it best. &quot;Gun control is no longer debatable, it&#39;s not a conversation, its a moral mandate.&quot;</p>

<p>Sen. Feinstein, you are doing the right thing in leading the re-institution of a national AWB. Never again should any public official state that their prayers and thoughts are with the family. That has become cliche&#39; and meaningless. Its time for action. Let this be your legacy that you bestow to America. Do not be swayed by obstacles, antagaonist, and naysayers. Remember the innocent children at Austin, Kent, Stockton, Fullerton, San Diego, Iowa City, Jonesboro, Columbine, Nickel Mines, Blacksburg, Springfield, Red Lake, Chardon, Aurora, and Newtown. Make sure this never happens again!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://content.clearchannel.com/cc-common/mlib/616/02/616_1360213161.pdf">Without gun control speak.</a></p>

<p><strong>Quote from user &#39;sillyfeetmcgee&#39; pointing out inconsistancies:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, the one you linked has an out of context rant about gun control thrown haphazardly into the middle of two connected paragraphs. It is written in a different style with different spellings and sudden use of 15 year old high school girl triple exclamation points. It&#39;s a non-sequitur that has no lead-in from the previous paragraph with ZERO relevance. Why would LAPD corruption be prevented by assault weapon bans?</p>

<p>They literally crashed into a random car and fired at it taking no time to determine if it was even the right person.

    <div class="md"><p>I did a comparative study of the two versions. I took 350 word samples from both the document claimed to be the original, and from the text specifically in regard to the AWB. While not particularly scientific, the writing styles are pretty different. While that&#39;s possible for a single individual to do, it&#39;s not psychologically likely while a person is operating from a &quot;heightened state of agitation&quot; like Dorne. Generally a person&#39;s writing style is consistent throughout these kind of screeds. So here&#39;s the analysis:  </p>

<p>I ask that all journalist investigating this story submit request for FOIA with the LAPD to 
gain access to the BOR transcripts which occurred from 10/08 to 2/09. There, you will 
see that a video was played for the BOR members of Mr. Christopher Gettler who suffers 
from Schizophrenia and Dementia stating that he was kicked by a female officer. That 
video evidence supports my claim that Evans kicked him twice in the upper body and 
once in the face. I would like all journalist to also request copies of all reports that I had 
written while employed by LAPD. Whether in the academy, or during my 3 years as a 
police officer. There are DR#’s attached to each report (investigative report) that I have 
ever written so they all exist. A FOIA request will most likely be needed to access these 
at Parker center or at the Personnel/Records. Judge my writin/grammar skills for yourself. 
The department attempted to paint me as an officer who could not write reports. Even 
though Sgt. Joel Sydanmaa a training officer who trained me stated for the BOR panel 
that there was nothing wrong with my report writing and that I was better than all 
rookie/probationer officers he has ever trained. Officer David Drew stated the same but 
refused to testify as he did not want to “get involved” with the BOR’s. Contact Sgt. 
Donald Deming ,(now a Captain at Lompoc PD), Sgt. Thaddeus Faulk, and Sgt. Ed 
Clark. All will state that my report writing was impeccable. I will tell you this, I always 
type my reports because I have messy handwriting/penmanship. I never had a single 
kickback/redlined report at Southwest division and Sgt. Faulk and Sgt. Clark can testify 
to that. I never received an UNSATISFACTORY on any day or week. The same can be 
said within the U.S. Naval Reserves. All commanders will state that my report writing 
was always clear, concise, and impeccable. Even search my AAR (after action 
reports),chits, Memorandum’s, IIR’s (Intelligence Information Reports) which were 
written in the Navy. All were pristine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Revoke the citizenship of Fareed Zakaria and deport him. I&#39;ve never heard a positive word about America or its interest from his mouth, ever. On the same day, give Piers Morgan an indefinite resident alien and Visa card. Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws but you must understand that your critics will always have in the back of their mind that you are native to a country that we won our sovereignty from while using firearms as a last resort in defense and you come from a country that has no legal private ownership of firearms. That is disheartening to American gun owners and rightfully so.</p>

<p>The honorable President George H.W. Bush, they never give you enough credit for your successful Presidency. You were always one of my favorite Presidents (2nd favorite). I hope your health improves greatly. You are the epitome of an American and service to country.</p>

<p>General Petraeus, you made a mistake that the majority of men make once, twice, or unfortunately many times in a lifetime. You are human. You thought with your penis. It&#39;s okay.I personally believe you should have never resigned and told your critics to shove it. You only answer to two people regarding the affair, your wife and children, period. I hope you return to government service to your country as it is visibly in your DNA.</p>

<p>General Colin Powell, your book “My American Journey” solidified my decision to join the military after college. I had always intended to serve, but your book and journey motivated me. You are an inspiration to all Americans and influenced me greatly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, some people here want you to believe that the only difference is talk about AWB.</p>

<p>The major difference is that he names several celebrities and tells them how they have influenced his life. He mentions politicians he&#39;s met over the years.</p>

<p>He tells Anderson Cooper what a great job he is doing, which seems to coincide with the package he sent him.</p>

<p>He mentions reading Colin Powells book and being inspired to join the military.</p>

<p>He mentions in 2002 meeting a politician in an Irish pub. Dates of his deployment in Florida match etc</p>

<p>There&#39;s just so much more of a difference.</p>

Someone would have gone through a whole lot of trouble creating a background about all these people, even people he met years ago while stationed on opposite ends of the country. Just to add a small snippet for a stance on assault weapons.</p>

<p>They would have also had to have added this very early on since all the earliest accounts of this I can find are this version. NBCLosAngeles.com claims to have pulled a cached version from facebook as the story broke. Theirs matches the extended version.</p>

<p>I understand the LAPD wanting to control damages, but the media complicity in releasing/redacting without clearly stating that there were redacted and unedited versions until fairly late in the game is disconcerting.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your position is that his minor mention of AWB has sent you on a crusade to try and convince everyone that half of the manifesto is fake. </p>

<p>The only thing you declare that makes it a fake just happens to be things you oppose. The reason given is that you pretend they are silly statements in this otherwise professionally written manifesto.  Strange, no? Why would the guy write about his old Sergeant etc if this was a fake to insert comments about AWB? Why are there 30 extra paragraphs talking about friends and family? Why didn&#39;t the forgers just add the small bit about AWB and walk away?</p>

<p>Then we have Anderson Cooper getting the same manifesto. Now you claim Anderson Cooper must be lying for ratings. </p>

<p>It just seems like you have very shaky grounds for dismissing half of the manifesto. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to get up for work tomorrow but I&#39;ve been so engrossed in this little fiasco I&#39;ve put that by the wayside for the time being. So I&#39;ve studied the situation, though not comprehensively (obviously) and this is my working theory -- feel free to add on. </p>

<p>At first I thought this was real, but now I&#39;m beginning to think it is a psy-op (that&#39;s obviously speculation).</p>

<p>Here is what I can confirm:</p>

<p>Someone named Christopher Jordan Dorner was employed by the LAPD and was an active military member (<a href="http://www.lapdonline.org/search_results/search/?q=Christopher%20Jordan%20Dorner">confirmed</a> -- click on the link from 2006. There should be an October 2006 Los Angeles Beat where you can find his name under active duty military members.) There is no picture to confirm that he is the same person as is described by the media. </p>

<p>Also someone named Christopher Dorner did sue the LAPD on October 3rd, 2011. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22541032/document-dorner-v-los-angeles-police-department-court?source=pkg">case link</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s unclear to me whether he is a real person or a creation of the department. Any elaboration on my part with respect to that subject would be unsubstantiated speculation. </p>

<p>The purpose of the psyop would result in a few things happening:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A further implementation of the police state already in place.</strong> -- <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/162464/lapd-going-door-to-door-as-manhunt-continues.html">LAPD going door-to-door</a> and <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/orange_county&amp;amp;id=8983695">article mentions roadway checkpoints</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>For the sake of arguing the other side, if the manhunt was real and the guy really was on the run, these are the types of actions you would expect to see from the LAPD. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Charging the LAPD with corruption would now be linked to a mass murderer who most people abhor.</strong>  -- This one is big. It automatically delegitimizes the claim of corruption because it&#39;s associated with this &quot;crazy psychotic murderer.&quot; Just try typing in LAPD corruption into google and see what comes up. As opposed to any number of stories in the media about LAPD corruption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also the LAPD has had a few cases of battery and police coverup that they would like to be overshadowed by other things. Portraying LAPD and especially their families as the victims makes them sympathetic to the public again, after the terrible things they have done. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Aggregate information about dissenters and people who wish the LAPD (or any government authority harm).</strong> -- This type of psy op also aggregates dissenters and people who are in favor of doing harm to the LAPD because those people are stupid enough to condone and endorse such senseless violence in the public record. This information will come in handy for surveillance and potential relocation purposes.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>See this prime example of idiocy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/LAPD-Cop-Killer-Christopher-Dorner-is-A-HERO/306145552822139?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/pages/LAPD-Cop-Killer-Christopher-Dorner-is-A-HERO/306145552822139?fref=ts</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To act as a microcosmic allegory for the war on terror (boogieman killer -bad guy vs. LAPD &quot;good guys)</strong> -- Same story -- we have a running distraction, a boogieman that makes the general public feel afraid while the media warns them of the danger, and the government reassures you it&#39;s their job to &quot;protect&quot; you further. </li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t have all the facts -- as things are still unraveling. But as my cosmic brother Joe Rogan says on occassion it feels like there is &quot;some fuckery afoot.&quot;</p>

<p>A few inconsistencies: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Multiple copies of the manuscript floating around which to me indicates intelligence disinfo and misinfo about gun control, popular culture, politicians and a bunch of other garbage.</p></li>
<li><p>If he really is fighting corruption, killing innocent civilians related to police officers does nothing for his cause. </p></li>
<li><p>Dude is trained to stay off the grid and not be found but leaves his badge carelessly in a dumpster? </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Dorner&#39;s LAPD badge and photo identification were found near Lindbergh Field by an airport shuttle driver.  Other equipment possibly connected to Dorner was discovered in a National City dumpster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QycTzwV7c">familiar</a>...</p>

<p>Oh and if you&#39;re thinking that the LAPD couldn&#39;t possibly make up some type of hoax well <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/28/local/la-me-school-shooting-20110128">you&#39;re wrong</a>.</p>

It ends after 11 pages.  After reading the manifesto and about an hour later, I saw the other manifesto posted with the added narrative at the bottom.  It went from a somewhat honorable distressed work from an intelligent man to a diatribe/social commentary on shit that has nothing to do with what he&#39;s trying to accomplish.  The link I originally found was posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/182by0/craziness_in_cali/c8aye0m">16 hours</a> before this post, just for reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anderson Cooper last night supposedly receives a package from him. And it included a manifesto that is longer than the original and has Dorner talking politics in it. The one Anderson received literally has the guy talking about dumb shit like how he loves to watch Piers Morgan and how he loved Michelle Obama&#39;s bangs. Here is a copy of the original one that most of the news articles linked to and referenced all day. (<a href="http://content.clearchannel.com/cc-common/mlib/616/02/616_1360213161.pdf">http://content.clearchannel.com/cc-common/mlib/616/02/616_1360213161.pdf</a>). Here is a link to the one Anderson supposedly received tonight. (<a href="http://documents.latimes.com/christopher-dorner-manifesto/">http://documents.latimes.com/christopher-dorner-manifesto/</a>) You can see where the paragraphs about dumb political shit got added in from the original. Anderson Cooper must be desperate for ratings. And considering how bad its been for CNN lately.( <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/08/16/158908783/low-ratings-force-cnn-to-find-a-new-direction)&amp;amp;(http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cnn-ratings-lows-piers-morgan-anderson-cooper-341733">http://www.npr.org/2012/08/16/158908783/low-ratings-force-cnn-to-find-a-new-direction)&amp;amp;(http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cnn-ratings-lows-piers-morgan-anderson-cooper-341733</a>) I hope nobody falls for this stunt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I see this guy as someone that is wound to tight.  Holding grudges for what appears his entire lifetime against the people he thought truly wronged him.  Even the case of him flipping out on the two officers usage of the n word when it wasn&#39;t directed towards him sort of shows he is way to righteous for his own good.  The incident of him reporting abuse only came out after he received a poor evaluation.  He tried to go tit for tat and lost when he should have just taken the criticism for once in his life, sucked it up and tried again.  This dude has a persecution complex that is, in my mind, very common amongst minorities.  He was a Navy Officer and a Police Officer.  Life is not perfect.  Now he&#39;s killing people with guns while supporting restrictions on guns.  That&#39;s a pretty incredible feat of hypocrisy.  He&#39;s an asshole and he suffers from being mediocre in life and is now taking out his unperceived weaknesses on innocent people.  I guarantee he was the kind of Military Officer that demanded respect but seldom gave it.  </p>

<p>Interesting story about him.</p>

<p>&quot;That year, he clashed with a former girlfriend. Dorner, in a June 2006 request for a restraining order, accused her of cyberstalking and harassing him by making intimidating phone calls and posting his name and badge number on the Internet.
Court papers filed by Dorner include an anonymous post on the website dontdatehimgirl.com, labeling him as severely emotionally and mentally disturbed.
&quot;This guy is twisted. ... He is super paranoid, always thinking that everyone is out to get him,&quot; said the posting.
The post continues: &quot;Anyway be careful because this guy is a police officer. ... He will probably think he can get away with anything.&quot;&quot;</p>

Use this <strong><a href="http://patdollard.com/2013/02/breaking-uncensored-manifesto-from-retired-lapd-officer-chris-dorner/">link</a></strong> when talking about Mr. Dorner&#39;s last letter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I was just watching the video capture of Dorner&#39;s obviously fake facebook page, and noticed this while looking at one of the pics of his certificates...I may just be being paranoid...but why is a white man&#39;s hand holding a black man&#39;s certificate and taking a picture of it to upload to his facebook? Why would one of his buddies take a picture of one of his certificates for him? Just seems out of place to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That i can&#39;t be sure of, but it seems odd to me that a gun-toting vigilante would want to ban his weapons of choice. That whole segment in particular seems tacked on afterwards for whatever reason. I&#39;m going to do a bit more in depth analysis of the supposedly unedited version, but I wouldn&#39;t doubt the possibility that it&#39;s simply his words mixed with someone else&#39;s for a specific purpose. Seems strange to me that he&#39;d give shout outs to random media and political figures, but I would bet money on the anti-gun thing being an addendum, as it is out of context and a non-sequitur.</p>

<p>What?  That makes all the sense in the world, actually.  How is it not making sense?  They could say that THIS guy right here is the &quot;perfect&quot; example of why you don&#39;t want &quot;the people&quot; to have regular access to guns.  I know he&#39;s a former PO and military, but I have a strong feeling they will conveniently pass over that particular detail and focus on the fact that AS OF RIGHT <em>NOW</em>, he&#39;s a civilian and a &quot;dangerous civilian on the LOOSE!&quot; at that.</p>

<p>Additionally to this, TPTB/MSM will now - again - use how &quot;horribly dangerous&quot; he now is as a great example of why the citizenry just &quot;CANNOT&quot; be allowed to have assault rifles, etc.  &quot;I mean just look at THIS guy!&quot; etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relax bitch. Nobody is taking your guns away. Your obsession with calamity is fucking boring and makes you look like a pussy, but nobody is going to take away your guns. It is too engrained in our culture. I suspect that one day these guns you desperately cling to will be needed in a revolution, and then you will feel vindicated, or you will feel the burn of a bullet tearing into your flesh. Good luck. I&#39;m extremely fed up with this bullshit (clearly).</p>

<p>Additionally to this, TPTB/MSM will now - again - use how &quot;horribly dangerous&quot; he now is as a great example of why the citizenry just &quot;CANNOT&quot; be allowed to have assault rifles, etc.  &quot;I mean just look at THIS guy!&quot; etc.</p>
