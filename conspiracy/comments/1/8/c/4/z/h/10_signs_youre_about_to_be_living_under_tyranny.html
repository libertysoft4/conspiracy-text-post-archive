<ol>
<li><p>The highest elected Official and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces does NOT have the highest security clearance. No other elected officials have oversight.</p></li>
<li><p>The names of bills and groups have the opposite of their meaning, such as the Patriot Act, Tea Party and Citizens United. </p></li>
<li><p>Due process is removed under the guise of safety and national security. The label of Terrorists removes all of your rights before conviction.</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly every Senator is a Millionaire and to be elected, you would need to spend 10’s of millions for a job that pays $200K.</p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Government hires private mercenaries. </p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Government trumps States rights, which is why we have States in the first place, to prevent centralized power.</p></li>
<li><p>Citizens owing the IRS $2500 may be subject to jail, while a trillion tax dollars are funneled to Wall Street, where bonuses are handed out to executives in companies like AIG. No one serves jail time.</p></li>
<li><p>The government exploits society’s most vulnerable citizens to fast track legislation controlling the tools of resistance.</p></li>
<li><p>Activists and whistleblowers are sentenced to stiff jail terms while not one banking scandal participant has been arrested nor was anyone brought to justice for the false intelligence that took us to war in Iraq. </p></li>
<li><p>Every media event has an increasing number of disbelievers, and conspiracy theorists representing a now measurable portion of society questioning everything. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus reason: The president signs executive order permiting the murder of US citizens with the use of drones.</p>

<p>Change #1 to: The Pentagon admits losing $2.3 trillion dollars one day before the world changed.
(For those that must have something researchable to a specific fact.)</p>

Arguing over &quot;spelling errors&quot; is ridiculous and a waste of our precious time at this point, and sure seems shilly.... Just sayin.... 
Op makes post about corrupt government taking advantage of its citizens.
Citizens post to defend corruption...
Seems legit.</p>

<p>2 happens all the time, it isn&#39;t just powerful groups either. Google the Tax Payers Alliance or The English Defense League. The Democratic Republic of [wherever] comes to mind too. All groups use language to further their cause.</p>

<p>4 has been true time immemorial, but in the West is less true than it ever has been.</p>

<p>5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha</a> and others are basically mercs</p>

<p>6 is purely US centric, tyranny is a universal term.</p>

<p>10 can be argued away as an effect of us all having these machines to talk to each other now.</p>

<h1>2 happens all the time, yes it should not. and people need to be aware of the reverse psychology at play.</h1>

<h1>4 indeed, just because something has been in place for a long time doesnt make it ok. slavery was around for hundreds of year, it was wrong the entire time, just like this.</h1>

<h1>5 The US has laws regarding mercinaries and why would the most powerful army on earth need private soldiers? to circumvent laws?</h1>

<h1>6 I live in the USA, this list is from an American view point. Although Tyranny is present in many nations. Some in softer form than others.</h1>

<h1>10 There is an increasing number of videos, blogs, posts, etc. after any event now that was not present even 2 years ago or even 1 year ago. This is also from a USA citizen stand point. Since Sandy Hook, every single media event has a conspiracy video on youtube to go with it.</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;&quot;The president is the one who established the security clearance system by executive order,&quot; said Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists. &quot;Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information.&quot;</p>

<p>if somehow a pacifist president was elected, do you think all those generals who made their living by killing people who disagree with them would allow the president to shutter the pentagon or release all their secrets?</p>

<p>there are a lot of very unscrupulous characters that have no qualms about killing, and it&#39;s not too much of a stretch to predict that they will (again) break the rules to protect their dirt.</p>

He was a little pissed about it. but there wasnt anything he could do (death threats I believe). anyways. the president youre looking for that tried this is bill clinton. pretty sure. correct me if im wrong.</p>

<p>Just because you have a &quot;Top Secret&quot; clearance you can&#39;t simply read all documents that have a Top Secret requirement. You only get what you are working on at the moment.</p>

Then you have basic Top Secret, and finally there is Top Secret Sensitive Compartments Information. Also you have Special Access Programs, which usually require a TS/SCI clearance. My first assignment when I got to my first command was as a shift worker SSO&#39;s office so I got read into several very interesting programs. On those long 12 hour watches on a Saturday night I would open up a safe and read some really really cool pubs. I work would also check out some amazing imagery on the light table when bored to practice the skills I learned in Imagery Interpretation C school. </p>

<p>To anyone that wants a great job in the Navy and hasn&#39;t done anything thing too stupid in their past that is documented to check out becoming an IS or a Cryptographic Technician (CT). I was on a 4 star&#39;s staff and had a blast. </p>

<p>The point I was trying to make is that since the President is at the top of the hierarchy he can declare that he has &quot;need to know&quot; for any compartment. He may not be formally read into some compartments but that doesn&#39;t mean that he doesn&#39;t have the power to be. For example, he probably isn&#39;t officially in compartments for classified US crypto algorithms, but if he wanted to be, he could.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re worrying about the &quot;semantics&quot; of tyranny (but again, I can&#39;t even tell if that&#39;s your point), then what&#39;s the word you would call it other than tyranny, and what historical examples do you think match &quot;tyranny&quot; that the list doesn&#39;t match?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re getting angry, I&#39;m honestly just trying to have a conversation. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with his first sign. &quot;The highest elected Official and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces does NOT have the highest security clearance. No other elected officials have oversight.&quot;</p>

<p>This is obviously referring to the U.S. correct? But the U.S. has already been said to define tyranny. If that is the case then the only piece of evidence one needs to know to understand that they are living under a tyranny is that they live in the U.S. Adding conjuncts only makes this truth more convoluted. Let&#39;s take two arguments</p>

<p>1- I live in the U.S., therefore I live under tyranny.</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>2- I live in the U.S. and The highest elected Official and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces does NOT have the highest security clearance, therefore I live under tyranny.</p>

<p>Both statements entail the conclusion that the U.S. is a tyrannical state, the only difference is that statement 2 has an additional &quot;unnecessary&quot; conjunct. It does not make the statement any more true.</p>

<p>For your second point, OP has already claimed that the U.S. is what defines tyranny, not that the U.S. falls under a historical definition of tyranny. If I am to take this seriously then the historical examples of tyranny would simply be those that match how it is defined by currently observing the U.S.</p>

<p>The reason being is because they want the tax money. If they just started spending billions to develop energy for post-Peak Oil, then people would freak out about Peak Oil. Right now there is almost no realization about Peak Oil amongst the general public and it&#39;s implication for depopulation. </p>

<p>The funding into global warming is primarily for alternate energy sources. When the oil runs out, these will be where those that remain get their energy from.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is very straight forward. I think a lot of people have pushed aside the hype of global warming, so if you don&#39;t think the upcoming threat they&#39;re preparing for is peak oil, then what is it? Are you suggesting that you still believe in global warming? I don&#39;t mean that the planet won&#39;t be warmer (it will), but rather that it will be the end of the world.

<p>CO2 in the atmosphere isn&#39;t going anywhere without a mechanism to remove it. What&#39;s going to do that, Einstein, trees? That&#39;s going to take years and years.

<p>CO2 in the atmosphere isn&#39;t going anywhere without a mechanism to remove it. What&#39;s going to do that, Einstein, trees?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to understand here. CO2 is at equilibrium. Adding more shifts that equilibrium. Think back to high school chemistry. When we add more CO2, some new plants will grow to use some of that CO2, yes, but not all of it. Overall, the equilibrium is shifted to a higher concentration of CO2, and that higher concentration heats the earth, causing global warming.</p>

Bill Clinton got in trouble for being a bad liar while he was a president, and the interviews I&#39;ve seen where he mentions his interest in possible UFO secrets, they were convincing. Especially in the context of the situation, I mean, the entire interview. He&#39;s not obviously tip-toeing around things when he talks about it, and it seems like he&#39;s saying as much as he knows. He&#39;s also talked about the subject of UFOs in several other interviews.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need convincing, though. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was lying in the interviews. RIGHT THROUGH HIS PRETTY TEETH</p>

<p>=EDITED.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with security clearances? Are you saying there are records that he couldn&#39;t get access to because he didn&#39;t have the right clearance? Or that the records just don&#39;t exist, or they used to exist but were destroyed, etc?</p>

<p>Then how come when I googled this topic I couldn&#39;t find any examples of him saying that?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>He just says IF there were any documents they were concealed from him. He doesn&#39;t know whether there actually were any documents, nor does he say it has anything to do with security clearances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subordinates doing stuff without their bosses knowledge is not evidence of a lack of security clearance.</p>

<p>Clinton never said he lacked a security clearance. Here is a quote you might be referencing: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I did attempt to find out if there were any secret government documents that revealed things. If there were, they were concealed from me too. And if there were, well I wouldn&#39;t be the first American president that underlings have lied to, or that career bureaucrats have waited out.

But if so, they successfully eluded me…and I&#39;m almost embarrassed to tell you I did (chuckling) try to find out.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a real factual account of the president&#39;s security clearance: he is above all security clearance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The president is the one who established the security clearance system by executive order,&quot; said Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists. &quot;Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information.&quot;</p>

<p>Although I can definitely see the benefits to him being unable to share ideas anymore.. That&#39;s for the conversation(s) RageMojo! It was fun, and a learning experience for both of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; I was on the inside of government, so I know there is more out there than meets the eye. You know, when I was elected, but before I was inaugurated, someone, a total stranger, whom I met on the street asked me to look into Area 51 and Aliens in Roswell, New Mexico. I laughed, but decided to buy a book about the subject. It was very interesting.</p>

<p>I asked my good friend Webster Hubbell to investigate the matter. When Hillary talked about the fast right wing conspiracy, she was mocked. Maybe the conspiracy wasn&#39;t a right wing one, but something else. I never did get a clear answer about Area 51 from the ones with the security clearance. And I was the president.</p>

<p>More than that you know what happened to me during my second term. And you know what happened to Hubble. He died. Sometimes you shouldn&#39;t ask questions why, you just have to accept reality.&quot; President Bill Clinton</p>

He gave wall street a trillon of our tax dollars, and did not close G-bay. Under Bush in Pakistan 1 drone kill every 43 days, under Obama 1 every 4 days.

    <div class="md"><p>What you said in your last sentence is the problem with this subreddit. There is no need for far out conspiracy theories like those that pop up here all the time. I&#39;m as critical of recent developments as the next guy, but the thought that everything has to be a <em>conspiracy</em> (&quot;an agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful or subversive act&quot;, to quote the first definition at hand). It puts too much empasis on intentionality. Which is hard to prove, doesn&#39;t really explain much anyway and, in the end, is simply wrong most of the time.</p>

<p>Fact is, almost everything problematised here can be explained by looking at the social structures, the political and economic systems of western societies. If everybody here would read some basic social science books, a lot of the useless speculation would vanish. And you could tackle the problems at their actual roots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you seriously saying the structure of modern society, especially the structure of capitalism, as it has developed over centuries has been orchestrated by a financial elite? Capitalism with its fundamental principles, imperatives and concequences to political and social life has emerged over an incredibly long period of time. That isn&#39;t something a few people have &quot;created&quot; out of thin air.</p>

<p>Obviously, the shape our society is in and has been in for a long time has highly problematic consequences for the influence of elites etc., but that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m trying to say here. It&#39;s not a conspiracy. It&#39;s socio-historic development that doesn&#39;t necessarily (or even at all) rely on a group of people intentionally orchestrating it. And you don&#39;t even need to assume some sort of conspiracy by the elites to explain the shape of our current societies. In fact, it has been explained by literally thousands of works by historians, social scientists, philosophers and humanities scholars. Reducing everything to the actions of a small elite, on the other hand, is incredibly and ridiculously reductionist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; I was on the inside of government, so I know there is more out there than meets the eye. You know, when I was elected, but before I was inaugurated, someone, a total stranger, whom I met on the street asked me to look into Area 51 and Aliens in Roswell, New Mexico. I laughed, but decided to buy a book about the subject. It was very interesting.</p>

<p>I asked my good friend Webster Hubbell to investigate the matter. When Hillary talked about the fast right wing conspiracy, she was mocked. Maybe the conspiracy wasn&#39;t a right wing one, but something else. I never did get a clear answer about Area 51 from the ones with the security clearance. And I was the president.</p>

<p>More than that you know what happened to me during my second term. And you know what happened to Hubble. He died. Sometimes you shouldn&#39;t ask questions why, you just have to accept reality.&quot; President Bill Clinton</p>

<p>Also, NO SHIT ABOUT THE VALUE, that is the most obvious consequence of not having money tied to a gold standard (which I would argue is worse world-wide anyways as it allows for a greater bullying of small countries).

<p>Interesting way to look at this, but I would argue the worth of monies is closely related to how powerful a government is and how much of a power they have to regulate the worth of a money.</p>

<p>For example, Germany sets the tune for the Euro, and the rest of the morons dance to it, whether they want to or not.</p>

<p>Similarly, due to a super powerful military, USA sets the tune for the dollar, and the rest of the world adjusts AND uses the US$ as reserve currency - or else, shit happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sir that does NOT give authority over the states. Makes the Constituition the highest law of the land for all states and gives the feds the right to make treaties on behalf of all. So say Texas cant wage war with Canada against the other 49 states will. Ok bad example, but this does not give fedral control over the states. That is what they want you to believe so they can push their agenda. Which BTW started with the war on drugs and is still being played out in that context. Our Constitution clearly did not want centralized power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I read and think about this stuff, the sicker my stomach feels.</p>

<p>From Wiki:</p>

<p>In September 2010, President Barack Obama informed Congress that the State of Emergency in effect since September 14, 2001, will be extended another year.[9][10] The National Emergencies Act grants various powers to the president during times of emergency,[11] and was intended to prevent a president from declaring a state of emergency of indefinite duration.</p>

<p>At least two constitutional rights are subject to revocation during a state of emergency:</p>

<p>The right of habeas corpus, under Article 1, Section 9;
The right to a grand jury for members of the National Guard when in actual service, under Fifth Amendment.
In addition, many provisions of statutory law are contingent on a state of national emergency, as many as 500 by one count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I wasn&#39;t trying to be a hardass, I just want to get all the facts straight. </p>

<p>I think if you put this together in a way that most people understand and can plainly see, they will &quot;wake up,&quot; as it were. Most people will just think you lied if you said Obama passed a law that allows drone strikes on Americans within the US. But, if you show them that they interpret current law claiming that it allows strikes on Americans in a foreign country, and refuse to clarify if this applies to US soil as well, and show them where they refuse to clarify, they must accept it because it can be plainly seen.</p>

<p>I find that sensationalizing things hurts the cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Am I correct in assuming that this memo detailing the legal justifications for using drones on Americans within the US is not an executive order as claimed in the op?</p>

<p>My guess is that the president will eventually make it legal to kill Americans within the US using drones, but I&#39;m assuming this is not the case right now. The memo is shocking, but it does not mean the law was passed yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The executive order was already given. The Justice Dept memo is their legal justification for when they do it. They are not waiting for permission.</p>

<p>And Allen West&#39;s comment was just an attempted attack on the Obama similar to the other articles you linked to, not a claim that he had clearances the Commander in Chief didn&#39;t have:

<p>That&#39;s not to say that there may be SCI / SAP activities the president hasn&#39;t been read into, but there&#39;s no reason why he wouldn&#39;t be granted access (or simply granted himself access as the CINC).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to dispute anything about the bullshit stuff the government does (and, ohh, is there a lot of it), but #6 is just stupid.</p>

<p>The whole point of having a federal government is that it trumps the state. There would be no point to having a federal level is the state could opt out of it, at which point the state may as well be it&#39;s own sovereign nation at that point. It&#39;s &quot;these united states&quot; for a reason, and not &quot;a collection of countries that just calls itself a bigger country&quot;.</p>

<p>Does a county whine &quot;county rights&quot; when something is done on the state level? Does a county get to opt out of something that the state decides the whole state needs to do? Of course not.</p>

<p>A state is essentially a collection of counties, and the country is a collection of states. Each level gets to dictate things at it&#39;s own level, and everyone under that level has to follow. To reiterate, if the federal level did not trump the state level, there would be no point in having that state be part of the collective. What&#39;s the point of having a state that can say &quot; I do what I wan&#39; &quot;? They&#39;re not a state at that point, they&#39;re a sovereign nation.</p>

<p>Further, what&#39;s up all this hate against specifically the federal government? Every level of gov&#39;t is fucked up and does fucked up shit. Some states to way more fucked up shit than the feds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791.[1] The Tenth Amendment states the Constitution&#39;s principle of federalism by providing that powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the States, are reserved to the States or the people.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that would be an example of something a state could do. An example of something a state cannot do is make slavery legal. An example is that they cannot cancel the bill of rights.</p>

<p>The constitution is a federal document that applies to all states, whether they like it or not. If all the federal gov&#39;t did was handle treaties and defense, there would be no bill of rights or constitution or amendments that all states have to observe. Yes, states get to do their own thing, but they still fall under the federal level if they want to be included in &quot;these united states&quot;. The point of a state is to be included in &quot;these united states&quot;, and to have the benefits that brings, while still maintaining some amount of autonomy. Unfortunately, that sometimes means you have to follow certain rules the federal level makes.</p>

<p>Further, if a state is supposed to be a check against centralized power, what is the check against the state becoming the centralized power? You still live in the state just as much as you live in the country. States get away with so much bullshit in the guise of &quot;states rights&quot; it&#39;s pathetic.</p>

<p>it is simple, if there are states that can make their own rules then we all have options to live in the USA but in a state that shares our values. Perhaps OK outlaws abortion or Colorado sells pot. People have a choice. When laws are handed down from the fedral level in washington, there is no choice, no options, no need for states. Which is exactly what they want. You see the government take us to war in iraq over complete lies, but we should lay down our rights more and more to them? you are insane.</p>
