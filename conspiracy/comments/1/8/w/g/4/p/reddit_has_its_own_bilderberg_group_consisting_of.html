    <div class="md"><p>He is only hinting at the existence of what is in reality an NY inner circle (it extends elsewhere, but this is the primary clique). </p>

<p>They are the operatives of payola for Advance Publications. You really think the sears <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RltB0.png">fax fiasco</a> was the only time Advance Publications et al ordered a hit on a thread?</p>

<p>How about when <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S08Jt">these</a> comments turn into <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ps8j6/here_is_the_police_report_with_the_details_of/">this barren wasteland</a>? Atlantic Records seems to have got on the phone pretty quick to quell the that twitter bomb. God forbid team breezy stops buying those itunes singles!</p>

<p>Anyways, watching masta come in claiming hate speech was behind the removal was hilarious as that imgur album promulgated throughout the land. More suspicious because masta was also posting advice in ideasfortheadmins asking for power to mass delte comments without having to confirm each and every time.</p>

<p>Or, what about the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17n20m/applebees_fires_waitress_for_exposing_pastors/">Applebee&#39;s thread</a> in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> which was deleted from the front page by moderators?</p>

<p>See, the sears fax fiasco must lead us to ask these questions. Otherwise people like those <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fIo2Z">ratpack</a> fuckers will continue to take paylola and degrade the very fiber of an aggregate by facilitating payola on a large scale.</p>

<p>This happen on subs starting about 50,000 or 100,000; but it is chump change at that point. Big money subs are a huge clique and SEO spamming is seriously dangerous. <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-trees-shaun-apple-resign-apology/">Cinsere from r/trees</a>,<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b7uoa/so_i_missed_this_whole_saydrah_fiascocan_someone/c0le33y">saydrah</a> and <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-hire-spam-ian-miles-cheong-sollnvictus/">SolInvicous</a> are but a few of the examples.</p>

<p>I think, albeit on a mundane level, this <a href="/r/soccer">/r/soccer</a> mod said it best. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HQGetan.png">&quot;We have had people offer us money in the past to put us on the approved submitter list and help them get their stuff to the front page.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Anyway, I think both VA and PIMA knew about this payola. PIMA went public about it and he&#39;s gone, just look at the rat pack&#39;s subreddit <a href="/r/risingthreads">/r/risingthreads</a> and you&#39;ll see what I mean about PIMA. VA resigned from <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a> after the Chris Brown thread was deleted. Then SRS randomly starts targeting him.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t even get me started on the hit bridages like SRS which are allowed to go around group voting and doxxing people because it furthers the interests of the red lettered people. &quot;Oh, we didn&#39;t ban that subreddit which was drawing negative media attention to us when we hand out our business cards at Advance Publications events, that guy resigned because his personal information was released by a know SA troll and we allowed the article to promulgate until he feared for his life and left the site. That&#39;s why it&#39;s gone&quot;.</p>

<p>Fucking payola man. Leave the internet alone you greedy fucks.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think this place was started for this purpose. Alexis got 20,000 in seed money from whom? And where was the idea pitched? And what company bought it first? All interesting questions. Monetize. Monetize. Monetize. It&#39;s the American way.</p>

It&#39;s for undiscerning consumers who can be easily swayed by an anonymous blurb&#39;s assertion of authority.

<p>2) Did music industry factions pay masta to have that thread removed?</p>

<p>3) What mechanisms are in place to stop payola by moderators on large subreddits?</p>

<p>4) Is your view, is it okay for moderators to make money by promoting/removing content on reddit?</p>

<p>1) Then why did Masta begin by cliaming he removed it for hate speech until he realized someone screengrabbed the comments, only then switching to the lynch mob excuse. </p>

<p>2) Like the idea that whitewashing a brutal incident of domestic violence into &quot;he hit her&quot; is wrong in furtherance of music industry profits?</p>

<p>5 yes</p>

<p>Censorship for profit is okay by you? </p>

<p>7 I wouldn&#39;t expose it to the users, I&#39;d expose it to the admins. I don&#39;t want to start lynch mobs. </p>

<p>The same admins receiving orders from Advance Publications?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 reddit is a company. reddit was made to make money. reddit fails at making money. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one disputes that. Rather it is how they make money on which my attention is focused. Advertising is okay, payola is unjust and, if exposed, would make people leave the site.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9 They could sell off moderation of the sub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention of adding them to approved submitter list? Or how about &quot;writing a bot to ban specific domains by having them marked as spam&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No &quot;endgame&quot; will ever make everyone happy.
You can either properly educate, which takes time and resources, but most people want to see their goals come to light sooner than later.</p>

<p>It is much more efficient to trick/brainswash/bait and switch.  If done correctly most people will contribute without knowing.</p>

<p>In this situation, it would be fairly hard to discuss the future of this site if everyone could chime in whenever they want.  As long as the public is notified of the &quot;best&quot; solution before they attempt to implement it, there really is no problem.  These people have worked for what they have, we have not.  We should still get a say, but we have no right to be part of early idea think tanks we do not directly contribute to in a meaningful way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple, people are only capable of effective communication in small groups.  Real communication is not 1 way like posting on reddit, it&#39;s 2 (or more) way and requires back and forth through multiple iterations.  This breaks down completely if the group gets too large so to maintain effective communication you have to exclude most people and form a small group that can effectively communicate.</p>

<p>There are of course consequences to this that we see everyday as elitism, exclusion, etc.  But there sadly isn&#39;t any other option.</p>

<p>Hooray for psychopathic revisionist history being accepted as fact. </p>

<p>EDIT: Looks like nighthawk decided to downvote and delete his response. Well, I&#39;m not wasting my reply:</p>

<p>The most important goal of <em>some</em> humans was to control other humans, and that was only after it was understood that humans could be more efficient than pack animals. </p>

<p>Also, your parroted ideology ignores completely that humans quest for <em>knowledge</em> above all else. Some for power over themselves, and yes some for power over others. </p>

<p>But saying THE MOST IMPORTANT goal has ALWAYS been control over other Humans is a textbook psychopath thing to say. </p>

 why is what other people are taking about any of your business?

<p>i&#39;m not sure if any have been peer reviewed. but multiple studies have been done since the 50&#39;s that have only showed this to be true. lack of peer review doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t so, as i can&#39;t find anything to the opposite.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the message I got to join this SUPER SECRET, RITUALISTIC, REDDIT MOD BILDERBERG GROUP!</p>

<p>&quot;If you&#39;re receiving this automated message, you moderate at least one popular reddit community. Thanks for your contribution to the site, and congratulations on your success. Please subscribe to <a href="/r/modnews">/r/modnews</a>, a place we&#39;ve set up for announcements of interest to moderators. Only the reddit admins can post links there, so it shouldn&#39;t clutter up your front page too much.&quot;</p>

<p>How many people are in my sub? Zero. Go fuck yourself with the steel rod your mother should have performed her abortion with you uneducated clown.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just joined so I could see what it&#39;s like to be a Zionist. Wow, learning how to CSS my subreddit is going to absolutely CRUSH Palestine.</p>

<p>2) Did music industry factions pay masta to have that thread removed?</p>

<p>3) What mechanisms are in place to stop payola by moderators on large subreddits?</p>

<p>4) Is your view, is it okay for moderators to make money by promoting/removing content on reddit?</p>

<p>5) In your view is it okay for administrators to make money for Advance Publications by promoting/removing content on reddit?</p>

<p>6) Have you been ordered to remove threads by admins due to advertising concerns?</p>

<p>7) If you had insider info on payola would you expose the perpetrator? </p>

<p>8) Do you believe reddit was set up as a vehicle for payola?</p>

<p>9) Can you list the ways in which moderators can monetize a large subreddit?</p>
