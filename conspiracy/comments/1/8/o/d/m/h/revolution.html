Our government is so separated that its almost impossible to get anything passed in the process. It seems to me, that the purpose of the constitution is to prevent anything like this, when the government is no longer helping america. Sure, they hand out welfare and social security to those who need it, but these systems are clearly faulty. Im just wondering, if anyone feels the same as i do. That the government isnt helping anymore and we need a new system. The ends justify the means.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right.  We need a way to be directly involved in the decision making.  There have already been efforts to improve it, using those White House petitions and similar programs, but we need pervasive transparency and citizen involvement.  There is a movement to make our democracy more direct and effective using the internet.  Here are a few links:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the police state is still functioning quite well even as the rest of the government is in full collapse.</p>

<p>Your own military  and police apparatus are set to mow you down for opposing  tyranny. </p>

<p>Seriously, the only workable solution is the peaceful opposition  of greed. Therein lies the road to changing the system.</p>

<p>Make them explain why their greed is good. It&#39;s the soft kill that will work as soon a s there is a tipping point in public realization. Help bring that tipping point. At this point it is our only possible move.</p>

<p>For all of history rich men have tried to come up with a moral excuse for greed. I assure you there isn&#39;t one. </p>

<p>Lets get just a few of  them spluttering their attempts to explain themselves and you&#39;ll see  their power source, sheer greed,  will dissipate and their control will be replaced by more reasonable men. They can fight you easily with endless numbers of mercenaries but they can&#39;t battle an idea who&#39;s time has come.</p>

<p>Greed is inexcusable as a source of power, but they erroneously believe it is and will quickly tell you (and the public) so.</p>

<p>Appearances are everything to the power of tyrants.</p>

<p>They may have the power to kill vast numbers but their logic is illogical, flawed  and will be lost as soon as they attempt to explain themselves The Rothschild&#39;s owe at least a couple of interviews to the world for example.</p>

Most of my family has never gone to college and their some of the most common sense filled and hardworking people I have ever met.

<p>I&#39;d like to avoid &quot;common sense filled hardworking people&quot; having guns, because the majority of people I know or who I&#39;ve ever known who would a. describe themselves this way, b. endorse this description of themselves, c. describe others in a good way using these words - are the kind of people who also think it&#39;s good to beat and bully their kids, be functional alcoholics, who have very little understanding for what&#39;s actually going on in their own lives, let alone the world, and are too fucking thick and dandy to be allowed guns by us.</p>

<p>We DO have &quot;some great knowledge&quot; compared to them and we ARE at the center of the &#39;god damned universe&#39;. It&#39;s far away from farm-town USA, and we all kind of just humor them because we know it would be in such bad taste to do anything but.</p>

<p>Because we know they can&#39;t help it, and we&#39;re better than them. So we give them what they should give to others, love and understanding, for the most part. The rest is secret disgust, but we&#39;re too nice to say anything.</p>

<p>The majority of &quot;common sense hard working people&quot; I&#39;ve ever known have been people who deserved me to beat the shit out of them at one time or another just for being so dumb, but I would never do that, because I would never hurt people who don&#39;t know as much as me(or, retards).</p>

You&#39;re not going to win against the US military in guerrilla warfare, and you&#39;re not going to change anything via protest. These are strategies that have been tried before, failed, and TPTB absorbed these techniques only to grow stronger. Agent provocateurs and the FBI funding terrorists are the norm now. Soon we&#39;re not even going to have guns to fight back with. These techniques are not going to work. Wake the fuck up.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackingdemocracy.wordpress.com">This</a> is a series of legal, safe steps anyone can follow to put the decision making power back in the hands of the people. Go on, try to find a problem with this plan, other than your own fear and laziness.</p>

<p>Will people always agree on what is right? No. But decentralizing leadership to every citizen sure would be better than consolidating power among the 1%. We have the ability to do this by the fucking next election period. Once I get a working DDD program up and running, I&#39;m going to try to get elected to the house of representatives in my home district under this platform. It&#39;s going to work. You can either be part of the real revolution or chill out while I do all the work, but I sure could use your help.</p>

We the people run this country in the end, even if we did rise up and start a revolution against the police/military state, those people serving are brothers, sisters, fathers, and mothers, of ordinary every day citizens. I dont feel they would try and stop us, minus a few power hungry whelps. It states in the constitution, that if the people want the federal government to step down, we have the right to acheive this goal however we see fit. And to those saying take away our guns and our rights to have them, wee would still be a british mercantile colony if we didnt have our guns in the first place. Granted, times have changed, but the right principles live on.</p>
