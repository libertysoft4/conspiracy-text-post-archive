    <div class="md"><p>TN here. I have not heard of this. However, I remember when we started getting camera&#39;s that detect speed in city streets and everyone was a gasp by it...why? we all motherfucking speed at some point and eventually received tickets. We got mad, made some waves in the courts and now they hardly send out these tickets. (OR people don&#39;t mind paying tickets)
The states agenda will crumble once enforcing this in TN. No one wants it if they are targeting us &quot;the speeders&quot;. THE only way this becomes effectively efficient is if the Federal gov&#39;t takes over.<br/>
How would they(state) make money on it if they didn&#39;t use it for speeders?</p>
