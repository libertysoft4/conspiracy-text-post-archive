Also, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Vp_Lc2IWNL/">reports</a> indicate that Dorner attempted to flee the blaze, perhaps to surrender, but <a href="https://twitter.com/sabzbrach/status/301512912302919680/photo/1">was forced back inside</a> to die by fire.</p>

<p>This man is dead now and there is nothing we can do about it. What we CAN do is ensure that the outrage that accompanies true knowledge of HOW this man died is not confined to this sub, and most certainly we can make absolutely certain the fabricated story that you can bet has already been canned and set to be delivered to the media does not have a leg to stand on. </p>

<p><strong>Make sure everyone you know and their mother knows the LAPD are a bunch of jack-booted, hood-and-sheet wearing cowards who penned this human being in like an animal and watched him burn</strong></p>

<p>America CANNOT wake up tomorrow with anything but the truth. </p>

<p><strong>Christopher Dorner was burned alive by the LAPD</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: LAPD may not have been involved. SBCS SWAT was running point.</p>

<p>EDIT: EVEN <strong>MORE</strong> Inciminating evidence submitted by u/kissarmymax: <a href="http://youtu.be/24WJr4Ye8xY">http://youtu.be/24WJr4Ye8xY</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Apparently Christopher Dorner&#39;s wallet and drivers license <strong>has been found in no less than three different places at three different times.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, don&#39;t say LAPD did it if they didn&#39;t, that destroys credibility. Dorner has been active in what sounds like five counties (LA, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego) and who knows how many cities. Nothing good can come from blaming people for things they clearly weren&#39;t responsible for. LAPD has done plenty of bad shit, but today&#39;s events probably aren&#39;t on that list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. This may not be obvious if you&#39;re not from the area but the cities/counties involved are totally different in terms of culture/geography/etc - not arguing against the &quot;cops stick together&quot; angle, but remember that Dorner (allegedly) killed one San Bernardino deputy today and wounded another, so the local people have their own motive for revenge; and the San Bernardino deputies are probably more sympathetic to the Riverside city cops who were shot versus the LAPD cops (and WTF were LAPD officers in an LAPD squad car doing in Corona? They were like 50 miles away from their home turf.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For full disclosure, my cousin is a San Bernadino sheriff&#39;s deputy. I very rarely talk with him, live on the other side of the country, and haven&#39;t heard from him since this incident. He may have been present, I honestly don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t influence my opinion here.</p>

<p>It is (not only) my speculation that in local police jargon, pyrotechnic tear gas canisters are called &quot;burners,&quot; possibly a reference to <a href="http://www.tomahawkburnsafe.com/BurnSafe-Instructions.html">BurnSafe brand</a> tear gas made in San Bernadino county and used by various law enforcement agencies in SoCal.</p>

<p>It is possible that each reference to a &quot;burn&quot; or &quot;burning him out&quot; is just carelessly replacing the term &quot;smoke him out&quot; with said jargon. That&#39;s exactly what tear gas is meant to do.</p>

<p>It is known, however, that pyrotechnic tear gas canisters can cause fires. This should be obvious in the wake of the Waco siege. The San Bernadino sheriff&#39;s deputies assuredly knew that this would be a possibility.</p>

<p>For the record, though, IF Dorner was still armed and at times firing at law enforcement officers, said officers were fully within their rights to take lethal action against him. This is why it isn&#39;t illegal for SWAT snipers to take out suspects. The use of tear gas canisters is a common, non-lethal standard way to encourage surrender and gain a tactical advantage in SWAT situations, even with the expected possibility of igniting fires. That doesn&#39;t really make it a conspiracy, it&#39;s just how such situations often end; taking a hostile suspect alive is less important than the lives of the police officers that are trying to subdue and arrest him.</p>

<p>Maybe he was getting too popular? A lot of people were starting to cheer him on. The cops didn&#39;t want him to become a martyr. So, they burned the house down and declared him dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found it strange when the BBC showed the CNN footage of the live gunfight. It looked staged... and I think it was. I think Dorner was as much a crazy lone murderer as Wade Page, Adam Lanza and James Holmes. I think you&#39;re being played, America. Now Obama has demanded a fresh vote on gun laws - that was quick - and his own tone suggests he&#39;s for tighter ones. The majority will vote for strictness out of a belief that it&#39;s the moral thing to do.</p>

<p>This stuff becomes predictable after a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a retired military opinion. What took place at that cabin was an act of tactical warfare. Not law. No different than calling in an air strike to have A-10&#39;s level the structure. The question we have before us is: When did the Police cross from upholding the law to engaging in tactical war fare? The threat present from the cabin was not a threat to any inicent parties. Questionably a limited threat to law enforcement who had control of the area. War fare tactics applied, he was exicuted. And the press covering that simple fact up worries me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As well as somebody who was mentally ill, still hopelessly obsessed about a job he&#39;d lost years earlier. Life throws lots of unpleasantness into all of our paths, thankfully the majority of us are able to deal with it without embarking on murderous rampages. If he wanted to further his cause of exposing police corruption, he could have achieved significantly more by remaining <em>alive</em> and getting his message out by other means. This man was ill, and lacked the ability to cope with things in a rational manner. I don&#39;t believe he was an inherently evil man and I&#39;m damn sure he&#39;s not a martyr or hero. Just a victim of his own mental illness.</p>
