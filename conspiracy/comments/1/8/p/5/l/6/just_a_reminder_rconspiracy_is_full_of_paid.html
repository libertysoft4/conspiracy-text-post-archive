    <div class="md"><p>That something like sock puppet software, online-marketing liars, megaphonies and other shills exist is one thing. But the amount of people who have been called <em>shill</em> in this subreddit is ridiculous. Also usually the only reason for such an accusation is based on a disagreement between the accuser and supposed shill.</p>

<p>If someone posts disinformation, call him out on it and provide for your counterargument sources which show why his claim is false. </p>

<p>If someone continues to spread disinformation or disrupts this forum with dishonest posts, alert the mods or the community.</p>

<p>Analyze the posting history of a submitter/commenter and show when and how he disrupts this forum and tries to kill genuine information or polludes this subreddit with a either a constant flow of disinformation or the production of disinformation (forum sliding) at a critical moment. Although this might not be enough to show that the poster is paid, it is enough to show, that he has a dishonest agenda. </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t doubt that disinformation is created and spread through the web by paid shills, I believe someone who is paid for disinformation will usually put it out at places where it reaches a wider audience. This could be posts in popular forums, original newspaper articles, books and testimonies of witnesses who make false claims etc. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hasn&#39;t that many readers and most subscribers are probably not very active in spreading the information they have encountered in this subreddit.</p>

<p>When the FBI targeted various groups with its COINTELPRO, it tried to create discord. The fear of infiltration was exploited and genuine activists were smeared as agents. I believe people who throw around unfounded accusations play right after the playbook of those who want to manipulate the free flow of information.</p>

<p>Once again, if you&#39;d been paying attention (as I believe you actually are), you will have noticed the preponderance of evidence; empirical, circumstantial or otherwise.  However, would you expect any of the said &quot;operatives&quot; to expose the true nature of their employment?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hai, guis! I&#39;ma work for teh NSA lol!!111!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, the first move of any intelligence agent is to expose themselves.  /sarcasm</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most false claims, assumptions, and ridiculous unfounded stories are in my opinion the result of misinformed, careless posters who just spread disinformation they have picked up elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there is a lot of frivolous non-sense on this sub.  However, with the understanding that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; community is thoroughly replete with misinformation, intentional or otherwise, it is better to be informed of any possible operations, legitimate stories, tin-foil hat claims and other madness and disseminate for yourself what is worth taking to heart and what is not...as you say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it would be more productive to analyze the fraudulent information and show the disinformative nature of such posts and submissions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason there are so many accusations of &quot;shill&quot; is because of the people who make the conscious decision to come to this sub knowing full well it&#39;s purview and, using subtle manipulation of conversations and insinuations of &quot;inappropriateness&quot; or of being &quot;misinformed&quot;, attempt to dissuade people from attempting to understand the scope of any one particular theory or piece of insight.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard to believe that &quot;our&quot; government and it&#39;s bloated, bureaucratic intelligence community wouldn&#39;t spend a couple million drops in the budget-bucket to spread propaganda, misinformation &amp; psychological warfare amongst the populace?  After all, they&#39;re already subject it&#39;s own <em>citizenry</em> to: </p>

<ul>
<li>domestic wiretap spying (made legal after the fact) &amp; drones</li>
<li>Indefinite detention without due process </li>
<li>Assassination without due process</li>
<li>Warrant-less search &amp; seizure </li>
<li>Bail out major banks that intentionally caused the recession and never charge any executive with a criminal offense</li>
<li>Refuse to charge bankers who laundered drug cartel money</li>
</ul>

<p>People have plenty to be suspicious of and are perfectly justified in behaving as such.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use language to imply that the poster is crazy/stupid/deluded etc., but never mention it directly - &quot;You&#39; have to be crazy to think that a <em>naturally occurring</em> mineral added into water or sometimes even naturally occurring in water would be any harm to the brain&quot; - notice it&#39;s saying &#39;you would&#39; instead of &#39;OP is a crazy nutbag&#39;? Also, notice the leap of logic here - lead and uranium are naturally occurring, and no doubt they would naturally appear in some water supplies somewhere in the world.</p>

<p>They usually rely on words, rather than evidence and substance.</p>

<p>They will suddenly have a strong opinion on a certain issue and will stick at the issue with great conviction.</p>

<p>They avoid answering direct questions and requests for evidence.</p>

<p>They avoid saying they don&#39;t know, don&#39;t understand, don&#39;t have evidence or that they merely suspect things - they will instead state things as absolute and self-evident facts.</p>

<p>They try to persuade rather than debate.</p>

<p>Any issues which are too difficult to answer - &quot;Why would anyone trust the same profession that inflicted the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment for 40 years until 1972 to be honest and ethical in releasing information about the risks of (or claimed lack thereof) with vaccinations&quot; - get completely ignored because it&#39;s too hard to respond to, and the more it gets acknowledged the worse things get. Better to ignore it and hope it goes away.</p>

<p>Maybe look into reading up on how PR/Propaganda is used, too.</p>
