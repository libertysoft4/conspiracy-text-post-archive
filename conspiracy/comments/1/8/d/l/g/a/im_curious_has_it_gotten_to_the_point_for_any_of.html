It seems if one did pull out altogether then they would suffer a huge credit score dive and prevent them from making large purchases such as car or home or major appliance unless paying cash upfront?!? </p>

<p>I&#39;m just looking for a friendly discussion, no need to upvote or downvote, I just want to hear what others are considering or have already done.</p>

<p>UPDATE: thank you all so much for the all respectful and helpful suggestions and experiences! For once an actual discussion on reddit that didnt result in everyone hating on the other. Keep it coming! I love the insight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would appear I live check to check. It&#39;s best not to have anything the government can garnish. Of course, if you decide to keep your assets outside of a bank, you absolutely need to invest in a safe.

    <div class="md"><p>You should try shopping for one, it&#39;s pretty interesting. Once you get out of the more &quot;mainstream&quot; mass produced models you&#39;ll find an industry that is much like watch makers and the like. They are very inclusive, very private, and few in number, which makes the likely hood of collusion with a bad element rare. Their business isn&#39;t a volume based model, so even the suspicion of criminal activity on their part would ruin them. There is also the aspect of warehousing these things for sale. These people can&#39;t just pack up and move in the middle of the night to new pastures and start all over again. Paranoia is a bitch, though. I&#39;d suggest reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burrow_%28short_story%29">The Burrow</a>, by Franz Kafka. It&#39;s a fun one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did for a while when I was paying off my debt. I did the debt snowball thing and did my groceries and walking around money in cash. There was something about looking in my wallet and maybe seeing a hundred dollars in cash and knowing it had to last a week that helped me control my spending. I really should go back to that. Though it wouldn&#39;t do a lot of good since the only groceries near me are krogers and they charge you about ten to thirty percent more if you won&#39;t let them track you. I wonder if the government pays them? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/15/magazine/15TOTA.html">TIA.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is shit but they make you use a card you have registered for so everything you buy is tracked. Even if you use cash. If you refuse to let them track you they charge you extra for everything you buy. Avoided krogers as a result till the last nonkroger grocery sold out to them. How much extra they charge you varies. I was looking at some olive oil that they wanted an extra $3 for if you didn&#39;t use a tracking card.  Kroger is evil.</p>

They had 2 guards immediately at the doors  making sure others weren&#39;t coming in to do the same.  Let&#39;s just say they tried contacting me 3 months later about some purchases on my non-existent account.  I literally told them on the phone &quot;I&#39;m holding my account closing documents right here with your manager&#39;s signature on it.&quot;  Then I told them the manager&#39;s name.  They immediately hung up and I never heard from Bank of Asshole again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bringing about change will not be comfortable.</p>

<p>Anyone with a job can buy a new car if they want. Car loans are handed out like candy. Houses are trickier, but with 20% down and verifiable income your credit score isn&#39;t that important. Credit scores are shit and to get rid of them will require discomfort; people should save up for the things they want, not pay for them later.</p>

<p>A local credit union will circulate your deposits to the local community. It will loan your money to your neighbors. They usually cost less, have better service, almost all of them can do online bill-pay.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest keeping enough in a credit union to pay your monthly bills, but keep everything else in cash. Groceries, gas, etc should all be cash transactions.</p>

<p>Understand the money you deposit into a bank is expanded via fractional reserve. For example every $1 you take out of your savings at a bank will &quot;destroy&quot; 5-10 times that amount of the bank&#39;s ability to lend money. IE, for every 1 dollar you put in, the bank lends out 10. This means that even people pulling a couple hundred bucks out each month will have a great impact. The sum is greater than the whole of the parts.</p>

<p>If you have money in the market... really this is how you can do some real damage to the system. Take it all out. Penalties be damned. This will be VERY uncomfortable. This will be VERY disruptive. What to do with it? I suggest precious metals, land, and productive assets. If nothing else, never use leverage.</p>

<p>In the end, the solution is to deploy your capital today on solutions that tomorrow will require no dollar inputs. IE a fruit tree costs a few bucks today, but provides fruit for years without the need for any more dollars. Every purchase you make, ask yourself if this gets you closer to your goals. If not, don&#39;t spend your limited capital on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I am in a shitty situation, my company (which I thoroughly enjoy working for) does not offer paper paychecks. I am forced to have a bank account with direct deposit. However I bank locally with the same company that holds my mortgage and it&#39;s a personable group of people working there, so that gives me some false security. I also have a 401k which is gaining exponentially the past year, which I am terrified to cash out in fear of a collapse. So, I leave it there gaining money in hopes I will get a sign when to take it out (being facetious). All in all, I can count on complete restriction to any and all of my finances in the event of a collapse. I personally am relying on my skills as a form  of currency if ever needed. What god is gold or cash after the first week of a collapse? people will need food and shelter before money, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Advice wanted:</p>

<p>Buy or rent?  I am in a position to be able to buy a house in the near future.</p>

<p>Rent:  A landlord can kick me out when the SHTF.  </p>

<p>Buy:  In the event of financial chaos/collapse, foreclosure would be very protracted, and eviction delayed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My Wife and I do not have a bank account. We only cash them at the bank they are drawn off of. We do not have a ton of cash on hand. We&#39;re working on that. She just started working a couple months ago after 5 years of school. </p>

<p>I did get a $100 check from my Grandmother for my birthday that was drawn off of Bank of America. They wanted my thumb print. I ripped it up and left.</p>

<p>I want to start gaining tangible and other goods we can barter with. Food, precious metals, etc. </p>

<p>EDIT: We are &quot;renting to own&quot; through our landlord who thinks just like we do. This was done by a handshake. And we do have a pre-paid debit card that we never have more than necessary on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banks dictate how much your legal tender is worth though. If a bank says your money isn&#39;t worth anything a grocery store is not going to take it. Or in the more likely event like 1950&#39;s Germany the bank will say your money is worth very little and the grocery store will still accept your money but will also assume it is worth very little. Imagine $100 loaf of bread and you get the picture.</p>

<p>If you really want to protect yourself from a banking failure you should be investing in commodities that will be useful in the event of a fiat currency collapse. I myself have about a 10 year supply of canned goods.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If a bank says your money isn&#39;t worth anything a grocery store is not going to take it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The money that your grocery store is going to accept is deemed legal tender at the FEDERAL level. The banks are in the business of storing and profiting from numbers games with that money, and only because it&#39;s value is backed by a guarantee from the FEDERAL government. </p>

<p>True enough, the government expands it&#39;s money supply through an entity referred to as &quot;The Federal Bank&quot;, but I think it&#39;s been more than proven that entity is federal in name ONLY. </p>

<p>A few presidents have tried to issue money that is purely federally ISSUED and without interest, and the same thing happened to every one of them. </p>

<p>And that would be because they were putting themselves at direct odds with the entity that claims to be both Federal and a bank. But that&#39;s another conversation.</p>

<p>Point stands: Banks do not determine what is and is not legal tender in this country. Period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mention the presidents that tried to issue federal money, I assume you mean the ones that were assassinated, they were unsuccessful in issuing that currency. The money we have now is a fiat currency that&#39;s value is determined in a non-sustaining market of futures and interest, the majority of which is the trade of bonds between the federal reserve and the united states government. In turn this federal reserve also determines how much money is printed and therefore has a very large interest in how much the US dollar is worth. If this company, the federal reserve, were to print enough money that the fiat bubble burst we would end up an economy governed by worthless pieces of paper. I guarantee if the shit hits the fan to the point where the Federal Reserve is printing so much money that it is worthless that the grocery store will simply lock its doors and wont give a ninny that those pieces of paper say legal for all debts public and private. </p>

<p>Point: The Federal Reserve is a very large bank and The United States Government has a Mortgage out from that bank that the US citizens pay interest only on.</p>
