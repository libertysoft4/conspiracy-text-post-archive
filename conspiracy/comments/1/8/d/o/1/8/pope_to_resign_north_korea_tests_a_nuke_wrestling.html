<p>Yeah but your opinion doesn&#39;t take precedence over his.  He has his opinion, you have yours, but his isn&#39;t stupid because you don&#39;t agree with it.  It&#39;s not a productive discussion at all, you didn&#39;t give any good feedback, just basically told him to shove it.  Classy.  </p>

<p>When <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> makes fun of this place, this is probably what they were referencing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That goes against the entire idea of this subreddit, your inability to understand the subjectivity of opinions is exactly the problem.</p>

<p>No one is dumb for posting their ideas, even if you see said idea as being stupid.  Because one man&#39;s dumb delusions are another man&#39;s truth, it&#39;s totally relative.  That&#39;s the entire point of this place in my opinion, anything and everything goes.  It&#39;s also what makes this place different, circlejerking about the same stuff over and over again is what the other subreddits do, not us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Seriously, the pope,nuclear weapons and wrestling are all part of some giant conspiracy? Fuck that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a subreddit where UFOs, Reptoids and other items are regularly discussed, where do you draw the line?  And whose judgement do you use?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people go on huge rants about how HAARP is controlling your mind and everyone smiles and nods.  Yet you claim to have standards to uphold?  </p>

<p>You know for a subreddit that labels itself as freethinking you really are quite dogmatic.  </p>

<p>It says right on your subreddit description...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Respect other views and opinions, keep an open mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how about you do that?  One man&#39;s delusion might be another man&#39;s truth.  Who are you to tell others what to believe?  This entire subreddit is based on the idea that everyone can freely speak their mind without people crying &quot;bullshit&quot; and whatnot.  </p>

<p>If you start censoring people based on what you see as &quot;retarded&quot; then why not censor anything and everything that anyone thinks is stupid?  It&#39;s a slippery slope.</p>

<p>Although it&#39;s amusing to see people that hate fascism and censorship become what they rail against.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s common sense to who, you?  Perhaps not everyone shares your opinion, who are you to dictate the terms of the community discussion?  </p>

<p>Perhaps I think it&#39;s common sense that any discussion on Dorner material should be nixed.  Do we censor every article based on the opinion of one person, or even the majority? </p>

<p>It&#39;s no different than any of the other discussions here.  Just because you disagree with it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bullshit.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s confusing how a group of people could be so opposed to censorship, then demand they censor others because of disagreements.  </p>

<p>Welcome to r/conspiracy, where free thinking and discussion is encouraged!</p>

<p>When you spot bullshit, call it bullshit, when you spot an interesting fact or a story you weren&#39;t aware of, investigate it and make an informed comment in a given thread.</p>

<p>Of course, a troll or a shill is usually called on his/her bullshit.</p>

<p>So I am calling you out, dingbat.</p>

<p>r/politics is thataway - feel free to come back to this subreddit when you grow and wise up.</p>
