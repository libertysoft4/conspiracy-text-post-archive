<p>Eh, I&#39;m not so sure.  I was expecting it before the second term so that Mr. Obama could be a wartime President and be sure of re-election.  Now that that&#39;s over, my theory is that it&#39;ll be all talk and no action...</p>

If you compare the platform of policies he campaigned on in 2008 and look where we are now, this looks like the greatest troll in the history of politics. He deserves our contempt for not fighting for what he campaigned on. However, I do think he actually believed he could make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think most politicians go into the game with high hopes and big ideas. And then they find out the real deal and the higher you go, the more you are bribed, manipulated, blackmailed. It all just depends on the type of person you are to begin with. I like to think that I could hold out for  a long time but sooner or later, you are going to hit that wall where if you are immensely popular and the powers that be want to use that popularity to further their objectives and if you can&#39;t be bought then they let you know how easy it would be for them to kill you or your family if you don&#39;t want to co-operate. I&#39;m sure Obama has been sitting at one of his daughter&#39;s soccer games, received a phone call and the voice on the other end let him know that they are watching his daughter play soccer through a sniper scope.</p>

<p>Howdy.</p>

<p>NO ONE can be worse than &#39;w&#39; bush.  It is scientifically impossible.</p>

<p>What is happening is that the lobbies got more and more claws into the country and government under &#39;w&#39;, and the natural progression of a rapacious predator is to get more and more, eat more and more.</p>

<p>Presidents right now are just puppets dancing on a string.</p>

<p>For example, immigration from Mexico (I know, right, I am so racist for talking about it).  BOTH parties are for it.  Enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Reagan did an amnesty, &#39;w&#39; wanted more and more so they could buy houses on loans from banks, obama is for it, and I guarantee the next president (R or D) will be for it.</p>

<p>On MAJOR policies there is no difference between the parties (yes, some individuals might posture and grumble, but all it is is allowed opposition).</p>

<p>Re: My favorite subject, the power of Israeli lobby in America, this article should be read by all (includes handy graphs!):</p>

<p><a href="http://nation.time.com/2013/02/04/just-who-do-they-represent-at-hagel-hearing-concern-for-israel-tops-u-s-troops-in-combat/">http://nation.time.com/2013/02/04/just-who-do-they-represent-at-hagel-hearing-concern-for-israel-tops-u-s-troops-in-combat/</a></p>

<p>Right now the Lobby is trying its utmost to torpedo Hagel&#39;s nomination - apparently the man received a few dollars from &quot;Friends of Hamas&quot; (at this point I assume an Israeli/Lobby false flag).</p>

<p>So, at least re: my pet peeve, this black president is doing better than &#39;w&#39;, who allowed the neocons (jews) to run this country 100%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About to get banned, but whatever. I know I&#39;m a sheeple. But for the love of god, stop bitching about the US. Move to Mozambique and then come back. Maybe then you can bitch about your computer, indoor plumbing, and anti-biotics. The mere fact that you&#39;re allowed to lay these slanderous falsehoods against the government proves everything people say on this subreddit wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you get banned first of all? Secondly, just because a worse place exists on earth, doesn&#39;t mean that this place is exempt from criticism. That is absolutely ridiculous for you to suggest. </p>

<p>Secondly, if you have been paying attention the last 10 years or so, you should be horrified at the direction the country went in. But I realize it&#39;s pointless to even argue with you because you are a status quo guy thinking that this is the freeist country in the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. I am horrified that there is no same-sex marriage, much corruption in the banks, no universal healthcare, ect. Many countries all over the world are just as free as the US. Finland, Denmark, UK, France to name a few. I would just love to know who people believe are &quot;pulling the strings&quot;.</p>
