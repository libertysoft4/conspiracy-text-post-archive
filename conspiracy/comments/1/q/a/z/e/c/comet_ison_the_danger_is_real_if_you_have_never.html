        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>NASA has pictures they aren&#39;t showing us, from Mars, from Mars orbiter, from Hubble. The dramatic major effects the comet passing had on Mars, which we can glimpse from amateur pics but NASA must have far better ones...</p>

<p>They are hiding something.</p>

<p>The way ISON threads are buried here is also curious, ISON is all over godlikeproductions.com and lunaticoutpost.com where it cannot be down-voted, here it ends up in &#39;Controversial&#39; almost immediately.</p>

<p>I think at the very least, if you haven&#39;t already, get some basics preps and some kind of escape plan to a remote location for your family and friends.</p>

<p>The odds on this thing affecting us globally in some way, from small to major, are quite high imo. It did have a visible large scale effect on Mars we know that much. I am not sure if it passes closer or further from us? But in any case the trajectory can and likely will change as it goes round the Sun, it could hit us directly yet.</p>

<p>Extinction level event or alien invasion are outside chances, but still chances with this thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think the truth of ISON is being suppressed by NASA and governments everywhere, and that includes here on r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear, not even the most pessimistic independent astronomer is predicting that ISON is going to hit earth directly, but its debris certainly will. </p>

<p>Whether that debris comes in the shape of a devastating meteor bombardment or toxic cyanogen nano-particles (which will mix with water in the atmosphere to produce cyanide rain) or both, or neither, only time will tell. </p>

<p>The other possible threats predicted from this celestial body involve damage to the earth&#39;s electro-magnetic shield which would allow life-threatening levels of solar radiation to reach Earth, and/or its gravitational impact on the earth&#39;s crust (causing eartquakes, volcanic eruptions and massive flooding).</p>

<p>Whatever ISON is, NASA, and your government (wherever you are) are deliberately not telling you the full story.</p>

<p>Read what John Bortle, the global authority on comets has to say about ISON - he sounds pretty worried to me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/science/observers-perplexed-comet-isons-erratic-performance-8C11512045">http://www.nbcnews.com/science/observers-perplexed-comet-isons-erratic-performance-8C11512045</a></p>

<p>I think ISON may pose a genuine threat to Earth, and any ridiculous theories concerning an alien space-ship is designed to sidetrack sensible discussion of that threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend not spreading fear about harmless events, such as a comet passing.  What do you think of that idea?</p>

<p>I wish we could wager a zillion Bitcoins on this comet event.  In the meanwhile, what is the mass of the comet compared to the mass of Earth&#39;s atmosphere?  Do you have the ability to multiply and divide?  Stoichiometry?  What is your level of ability here?  I wonder, because a back-off-the-envelope calculation would clarify everything for someone who is able to perform that.  So I assume you are unable.</p>

<p>I know what you mean: Cyanogen is about 1 nm long and about 0.2 nm wide.  But nobody uses those units.  Chemists use angstroms.</p>

<p>Whether a molecule is a &quot;particle&quot; is another interesting question.  Is it a particle in the sense that &quot;nano-particle&quot; would have to mean?  It can&#39;t be, e.g., an electron.  That would be a &quot;femto-particle.&quot;  A &quot;nano-particle&quot; seems to me that it should be something well-defined and not amorphous.  Most molecules are amorphous.  Arguably, cyanogen is not.</p>

<p>This is something you could actually calculate, but I won&#39;t hold my breath. Just know that the moon is <em>unimaginably</em> more massive, and <em>much much</em> closer than ISON will ever be, and it has yet to rip our tectonic plates apart.</p>

<p>But, it sounds like you have a laundry list of reasons to be afraid of ISON. What a remarkable coincidence that one small comet should have a dozen different ways of killing everyone on earth. Well, to be fair, the gravitational one doesn&#39;t really hold water, but I know that there must be <em>some</em> reason to be afraid, dammit! I mean, it&#39;s a comet!!!</p>

<p>In the context of ISON, I&#39;m going with they&#39;re using it as a distraction because they don&#39;t think it&#39;s meaningful. However, that does not mean it is not.

    <div class="md"><p>During my morning reading-routine, I stumbled across this woman&#39;s vision (yes, yes I know, just stay with me here) that was posted yesterday.  Take notice of what substance is the culprit of death.  Random internet weirdness? Most likely yes, but strange indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VISION OF CLASSROOM WITH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS HAVING BEEN POISONED WITH CYANIDE!
Steve, I am very troubled about a vision I had last night. Have been seeking the Lord about this for the last couple of hours, and cannot disregard it. I keep getting verification in my spirit of the vision, but I also asked the Lord if this vision was from Him, to confirm it. </p>

<p>Also, I have asked why He showed it to me. When and where - what did He want me to do. The only answer I received was - to warn His people. I have no other answer.</p>

<p>During my prayer time last night, in the vision I was taken to a classroom. The children were there, so was the teacher, it was during class. I seemed to be invisible to them, and stood off to the side of the room to watch why I had been taken there.</p>

<p>Of course, I had read the Alerts and Dreams/Visions sections of your web site about possible attacks on school children. Because of this, I was listening and watching for an alarm to go off, for the children to be evacuated, for any kind of commotion. But nothing like that happened, they just kept having class. So I really wondered why I was there - what was I to see?</p>

<p>After a while I noticed that the children and the teacher were no longer sitting up - they were slumped over their desks. I wondered what had made them so sleepy (I assumed they were asleep). But then I realized that they had died. What horrified me was not just this tragedy, but also that, with all being dead including the teacher, there was nobody to alert anyone on the outside. They would only be found like this some time later - everything was so quiet! SQ-I RECEIVED THIS AFTER I HAD POSTED IRS STORY AND FELT PROMPTED TO WARN PARENTS TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN HOME NEXT WEEK DURING GRID EX EXERCISE WHICH COULD GO LIVE-THIS SISTER IS A FULL TIME INTERCESSOR AND HAS THE GOODS!</p>

<p>I asked the Lord what had happened, and the answer was &quot;cyanide.&quot;
Steve, I knew in my mind that what happened must have been caused by a gas. But all I was familiar with in regard to this poison were the pills or capsules, and that from news reports in past years. But the web has enough information about this as a gas as well that I am genuinely concerned.</p>

<p>A bit later on I also - in a vision - saw the parents coming into the school. Mothers fainted, I do not know if it was from the gas residue or from finding the children.</p>

<p>Now here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a religious man and for the most part, I think <em>all</em> religions are bunk.</p>

<p>That said, I do find these types of coincidences quite interesting nonetheless. Now, there is always the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts">ancient astronaut</a> theory. Perhaps they (the human population at the time) received warning ages ago and their best way of describing it was the way they did in the Bible. </p>

<p>Science and &quot;magic&quot; (religion) can seem one in the same at times when the causes are unknown. I mean look at the Salem Witch trials... and that wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> long ago. If you drove an automobile through the Middle Ages, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d describe far more glorious and abstract than what it really is.</p>

<p>Either way, I am curious about ISON and I do believe there is something strange going on with the lack of information from NASA about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.  At some point religion was all people had to describe their world.  It was to them what science is to us now, which is in many ways comparable to religion as it existed in certain aspects in certain time periods.  They wrote it as a history and as the best explanation they could give and alot of it isn&#39;t utter bullshit.  It is merely very very difficult to decifer and at times unspecific, off the mark, and utterly human.  People just like to twist things for alterior motives and, alas, spirituality happens to be an a+ method to gain control over people&#39;s though and whatnot.  I don&#39;t want to give too much credence to all spiritual prophecy but there were plenty of extraordinarily intelligent philosophers who put down their thoughts in this context that, at the right time, in the right context will be shown to have a certain insightful message to share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm. Did you include it&#39;s speed into your thought process? mass increases with speed. more mass means more gravitational pull. the moon has a relatively constant pull. an approaching comet at high speed has a slowly (?) increasing, peaking and then decreasing pull. are you certain thag it can&#39;t have an noticeable influence? i don&#39;t see how possible effects are comparable with the moon at all.</p>

<p>Some easy googling found that an asteroid passed between the earth and the moon (read: millions of miles closer than ISON will pass) earlier this fucking year.

    <div class="md"><p>Every time a comment comes through people come unhinged and start talking about the end being near.  Yet thousands upon thousands of years life on earth keeps right on going same as it did the day before.   The rich and the powerful continue to exploit the poor and the weak.  Disease, war, starvation ravage us endlessly.  Comets, not so much.  Unless one of these things is on a collision course it has absolutely no chance of causing us any harm. </p>

<p>We pass through the dust trails of comets on a regular basis.  The predictable meteor showers we see routinely through the year are often the remnants of comets that have been through the inner solar system.  A couple of years ago I remember some in the conspiracy community getting all wound up over another comet (can&#39;t remember the name off hand).  Some were claiming it was Nirubu others that it was going to bring massive tectonic destruction as it came in line with the sun, earth and another planet in the solar system.  I laughed as I watched people with absolutely no scientific background rant on endlessly about things they didn&#39;t understand.  But then as it thought about it it made me sad because it is exactly that kind of bullshit that colors the view of the general public when you try to make people aware of the real dangers to humanity right here on our own planet.  </p>

<p>Unless a comet is on a collision course relax and enjoy the cosmic light show in the sky and then get back to wording about what really matters, what our own species is doing right here on he planet.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/105087/comet-ison-goes-green/">Universe Today</a> does discuss the makeup of this space dust, however, (such as cyanogen and diatomic carbon) and it could be a real problem for all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this would be a back-of-the-envelope calculation to give a strict upper limit, and my hope was that if someone actually worked it out they would see that even this upper limit was nothing to be concerned with.</p>

<p>I got as far as noting that it would be 1 pico-percentage (1 * 10<sup>-14</sup> ) of the atmosphere by weight, before deciding working out the molecular concentration would be pointless. It would be more dilute than most homeopathic remedies.</p>

<p>And of course, the entire comet <em>isn&#39;t</em> cyanogen, and the whole thing <em>won&#39;t</em> be absorbed into the atmosphere, so the concentration would be far less still.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary.  I&#39;m not around any Cyanogen at the moment, and the Cyanogen in Comet ISON is a trivial tiny amount that is nothing to &quot;be afraid of&quot; as you advocate fear.</p>

<p>And notice how sincerely and literally you flat-out advocate fear.  You actually wrote: &quot;... you should be afraid of.&quot;</p>

<p>That is fear-mongering. </p>

<p>None of the chemicals are &quot;nano particles,&quot; in any meaningful sense of the word.  Nano-Plex Tank Armor is made of nano particles, Norvo Nordisk Factor 7 is nano particles, but normal molecules should not be confused with nanotech fabrication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that ISON goes around the &quot;far side&quot; of the sun at the end of November, and comes back into view in early December. I think it should be visible near dawn/dusk at that point. It will become more visible during December and January it gets further away from the sun. The early predictions were that it could be brighter than the full moon at that point, but there is no consensus. The truth is that astronomers know less about comets than they want to admit.</p>

There have been a slew of books written about the different opinions of famous scientists and alchemists on the properties of comets. But one thing is consistent. Every time a comet visits our planet shit gets crazy.</p>

<p>So before anyone disregards the odd viewpoints just remember that history repeats itself. In this history of this planet.. some interesting things have happened when comets make an appearance.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an interesting book available on Google Books called &quot;The Ages of Two-faced Janus: The Comets of 1577 and 1618 and the Decline of the Aristotelian World View in the Netherlands&quot; which goes into detail of different viewpoints of scholars throughout history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is about it for me. I think they are using the situation in Fukushima to build up yet another theatrics spectacle. Something they can shock and stun and scare Mr and Mrs MSM with to their very core, if they so desire, where Mr and Mrs MSM and their little kiddies will feel <strong>safe</strong> with APCs rolling down the street...to make sure everything&#39;s ok. That kind of crap. Then the first time anybody gets wronged and fights back, they loose the anti-government, conspiracy whackjob playbook on the media that they are dipping in the waters right now and the same sick game goes on. Neighbors reporting neighbors, violence that slowly escalates and like every damn thing everyone gets at once accustomed to and broken down by. Glad I have a few acres to grow.
