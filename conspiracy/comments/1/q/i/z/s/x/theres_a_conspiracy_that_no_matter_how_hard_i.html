<p>there were people caught in white vans with fake security passes for the twin towers on the day of the attacks. they had been filming the first attack (how could they of known?).  <a href="http://imgur.com/AZH8Rh5,c4TimfE">http://imgur.com/AZH8Rh5,c4TimfE</a></p>

<p>They all worked for a foreign secret service in communications and ordinance.</p>

<p>They were calling in bomb threats on 9/11. sending police, that were much needed, all over the city.</p>

<p>They were caught with explosives and bomb making equipment and were heading to the tunnels and bridges.</p>

<p>Individuals had multiple passports for many different countries and lots of cash, but just babbled at the police about how they were Americas friend and how they had mutual enemies.</p>

<p>Some of them were even living next door to the supposed lead hijacker.</p>

<p>They ball failed lie detector tests but were released on bail and fled the USA.</p>

<p>the implications of this conspiracy go towards the reasons 1000s of young americans and brits have been killed fighting post 9/11 wars (&#39;for freedom&#39;) in sandville.</p>

<p>so have 1000s of our soldiers been killed by these fuckers starting false wars over false attacks? and why hasn&#39;t the media or government taken care of the ppl it&#39;s meant to serve? what kind of american traitor would sell his soul and send their countries kids to a fake war on terror?</p>

<p>Yes sir/ma&#39;am.  Thousands of our soldiers and - just as importantly - <em>millions</em> of civilians from other countries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and why hasn&#39;t the media or government taken care of the ppl it&#39;s meant to serve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because, my good man/woman, the media and government are not <em>meant</em> to serve the people.</p>

<p>...They&#39;re not.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been told and meant to <em>believe</em> that they do - but that is only so that we can be better, more obedient, less-likely-to-revolt slaves to the machine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, it&#39;s not quite <em>that</em> easy or clean, cut, and dry.  You see, the people who are REALLY responsible for doing that, and who REALLY know the score/what they&#39;re doing don&#39;t really tell the others who they&#39;re sending to war exactly what they&#39;re going to war FOR.  Everything is on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis...and almost <em>NO ONE</em> &quot;needs to know&quot; why the <em>real</em> PTB are doing what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>Shit is fucked up on this planet.  For sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, you would be referring to the &quot;dancing Israelis&quot; incident--which is <em>the</em> smoking gun of 9/11.</p>

<p>These pieces of shit actually went on an Israeli TV talk show to brag about what they did.</p>

<p>Remember that, besides for all of the OTHER Israeli-owned (UMS) white vans that day (some loaded with explosives set to blow bridges--one with a mural of a plane <em>hitting the towers</em> used as a decoy--and the fake calls to the cops about &quot;Palestinians&quot; mixing bombs) Silvan, Kurtzburg, and the rest of those assholes had their camera set up and rolling nearly <strong>30 minutes</strong> before the first plane hit. And they admitted it! On national television no less...in plain Hebrew!</p>

<p>Couple this with the Gomel Chesed Cemetery incident, the fact that &quot;Lucky Larry&quot; Silverstein leased buildings that were <em>losing revenue like crazy</em> and needed to be completely rebuilt due to asbestos--then insured them against acts of terror <strong>6 weeks</strong> before they were brought down (netting him billions of dollars), the Odigo incident, the fact that NOT ONE Israeli died in the towers that day (statistically the number of Israeli dead should have been 400-500 and only ONE died--on an airplane), who ran &quot;security&quot; at WTC/Logan Airport (Israeli-owned ICTS), and who stood to benefit the most from 9/11 (along with about 1,000 other things) and you should have a GREAT idea as to who pulled off the crime of the century--along with their American <em>sayanim</em> and their PNAC buddies.</p>

<p>The truth MUST get out about this. Israel is not only NOT an ally of the US--they have caused more damage and deaths to Americans than nearly any country in the history of the US. The only country to even come <em>close</em> is Germany during WWII--which, as anybody who has been to Israel lately will tell you--the Israeli state is modeled after...right down to the mass killings and concentration camps.</p>

<p>The fact that America basically gives a blank check to these fuckers while <em>our own citizens</em> are homeless, jobless, and helpless...NOTHING could possibly anger me more--well, I guess the fact that they use the money and weapons that we &quot;loan&quot; (read: give--they have NEVER paid back a loan) them to slaughter innocent civilians en masse as they forcefully occupy land that they stole from the indigenous population (hey, just like we did with the Native Americans!)--THAT angers me more.</p>

<p>To learn more about Israel&#39;s HUGE part in 9/11 I cannot recommend one (free!) book highly enough--Christopher Bollyn&#39;s &quot;Solving 9/11--The Deception that Changed the World&quot; available on his site. EVERY point is meticulously researched and footnoted as he tells the story of how the Zionists pulled off one of the biggest crimes in human history--and got away with it scot free.  </p>

<p>Spread this story far and wide. If they KNEW it was going to happen <em>they were complicit in it happening</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For anybody that is curious about the incident with the Israelis this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020802194310/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/DailyNews/2020_whitevan_020621.html">link might shed some light on the matter.</a> </p>

<p>OP&#39;s photo of the white van is obviously false. Apart from the glaring photoshop errors. The fact that they had a mural on the van depicting a plane hitting the twin towers would have been more than enough evidence to arrest these men on different charges other than what happened:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The five Israelis were held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, ostensibly for overstaying their tourist visas and working in the United States illegally. Two weeks after their arrest, an immigration judge ordered them to be deported. But sources told ABCNEWS that FBI and CIA officials in Washington put a hold on the case.</p>

<p>The five men were held in detention for more than two months. Some of them were placed in solitary confinement for 40 days, and some of them were given as many as seven lie-detector tests. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like they were arrested on suspicion of terrorism and detained illegally for months. After they found very weak or no evidence of being involved they were reluctantly released. If they had a van with a mural of the planes hitting the twin towers that would be enough evidence to send them to Guantanamo for life. </p>

<p>What I see here is an example of post-9/11 paranoia; it&#39;s so striking because it happened instantly, hours after the event, signaling a pretty important change in consciousness for the average American. </p>

<p>When the news broke out of this incident biased sources (mainly in the middle east) ran with the theory because it sheds negative light on Israel. And now enough time has passed and the story has circulated enough times that it is impossible to tell what is actually true. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, we tried to prosecute some Israeli kids for acting strangely. I think this fact is what we should be focusing on and outraged about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the person in the recording might be describing another truck that was not photographed. </p>

<p>More likely somebody listened to the recording you posted and Photoshopped an image to look like the van that person in the recording described along with the name of the moving company the Israeli&#39;s worked at to provide &#39;proof&#39; for their readers. </p>

<p>I am still not convinced it is the same incident because they even say that the van burned or blew up. There is nothing in the police reports about the Israeli&#39;s van blowing up at any point or any bomb making materials. Again that would have been evidence enough to convict them of terrorism., the closest thing they found was a box-cutter, something not out of place for a moving truck</p>
