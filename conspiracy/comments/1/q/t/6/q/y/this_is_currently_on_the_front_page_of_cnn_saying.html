<p>Seems odd that CNN would even remotely put out the idea that the CIA had kennedy killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, this was in another generation. To the people in news media now, the JFK assassination and the surrounding criminal conspiracy is just pop entertainment, it&#39;s about as meaningless as the superbowl.</p>

<p>Anything to avoid discussing the fact that arch criminals running our society are currently finalizing and already going through with the largest wealth transfers in the <em>history of humanity</em>, and that a criminal clique in the highest positions of power recently lied our whole country into wars in which roughly 1,000,000 people died, and tens of thousands of us were maimed/killed ..for the profits of their other criminal friends, because no one else was benefited. Blatant lies, a million or so deaths and lying a country into wars using what were admitted fabrications within 5 years.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even talk about this. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS or any of these other massive ongoing criminal enterprises directly responsible for more deaths than any other in modern history.</p>

<p>These people have had multiple presidents, passed thrones on to their sons, lied us into multiple wars, and done so much shit in the past 10-20 years alone that it makes the JFK assassination look like a family outing to an amusement park. Anything to keep the masses entertained and keep them thinking the media(the media, the medium of exchange of ideas between rich and poor) is at all credible or &quot;on their side&quot;/&quot;critical&quot;/unbiased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is actually not true. I guess you didn&#39;t read the article though. It solely points to the CIA AS AN ORGANIZATION which is okay, but its clear that multiple sides were involved and that LBJ at the very least knew about it. </p>

<p>So they wash everything aside as crazy cook stuff, while saying the CIA might, but might not have been involved, bla bla bla there is not enough evidence blah blah....</p>

<p>So basically if you have questions you are a cook and might or might not the CIA been involved. </p>

<p>So its clearly propaganda designed to make you never question anything outside of the mainstream and official story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I was kind of thinking the same thing.  The MSM is the opportunistic, parasitic wing of the opportunistic, parasitic PTB.  They wouldn&#39;t do something like this without having some sort of ulterior motive <em>against</em> the people, so this seeming admittance...might be...who knows - a limited hangout designed to quell the mass of independent investigation that might be actually getting REALLY close to the actual truth?  Maybe they&#39;re hoping that putting out a story like this might cause the <em>real</em> investigators to get distracted or lose their focus and concentration, and that might take them off the trail that they might be right on top of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s certainly another viable possibility.  Sow the seeds that will eventually give the government the justification to instill martial law.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then it would be pretty deep indeed because it would seem that the final false flag against the people...would be the people themselves.</p>

<p>That being said, this would be <em>very</em>, very risky chess TPTB would be playing then because they are assuming that the state WOULD be able to quell and control the people, and although the fact of the matter is that the cards are indeed stacked against the masses - most of us being little more than brainwashed sheep that would not know what to do against the instilling of martial law but simply go along with whatever the state says like obedient slaves - there is still the possibility that enough intelligent dissent amongst enough of the population <em>could</em> possibly take place, and if enough of the nation were to simply refuse to cooperate and go against TPTB, our overwhelming numbers could indeed win the day.  Make no mistake about that.  Easier said than done, of course, but if we could put our indoctrinated, state-imposed differences aside, see all of them as the artificial artifices of manipulation that they are, come to look at one another as the ONE PEOPLE which we indeed very much are, and we all come together as one to fight (peacefully or otherwise) against the manipulation going on around us, then it would be VERY difficult to oppose us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but these MSM stations are owned by much greater powers above them, and it is <em>those</em> powers that call the real shots with regard to what gets aired and what doesn&#39;t.  If Station A wants to release some info that gives them the upper hand against Station B, but that info might threaten an order that those who <em>control</em> both Station A and Station B don&#39;t want disrupted, then it would seem that the info presumably wouldn&#39;t get let out.

    <div class="md"><p>No, it wasn&#39;t edited.  The idea is idiotic.</p>

<p>The ARRB on the advice of Doug Horne, hired Rollie Zavada in 1998 to study the film in the National Archives.  Zavada was the lead technician on the team that invented Kodachrome II film, which the Z film was shot on.  Horne thought Zavada would certainly find evidence of revision.</p>

<p>Instead, months later Zavada turned in a 300 page report insisting that the film in the archives was an unaltered in camera original and was shot on Zapruders camera to the exclusion of all other cameras.  Furthermore, he stated that undetectable editing of an 8mm home movie using materials available in 1963 was absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>He did his investigation completely pro bono and was never involved in anything related to the assassination prior to being hired by the ARRB.</p>

<p>His report is available online and his methods are described in detail.  Feel free to read it over and point out where he got it wrong.</p>

<p>Compare his qualifications to Rollie Zavada:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rollie Zavada retired as a Standards Director for Imaging Technologies from Eastman Kodak in March 1990.  His background included product engineer development responsibilities to introduce KODACHROME II films, Chairman of the Society of Motion Picture and television Engineers (SMPTE) 16&amp;8 Standards Committee during the transition from 16 to 18 fps velocity for silent movie films and four terms as SMPTE Engineering Vice President.  A Fellow of four technical societies, Mr. Zavada received many awards for his technical achievements including being elected as a Life member of the Foundation of Motion Picture Pioneers Inc. Author of the Kodak report to the ARRB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Horne has no training in film or photography either.</p>

<p>Professor Raymond Fielding was asked if such alteration was even remotely possible.  Fielding categorically stated it was not.  Here is Fielding&#39;s laundry list of credentials in case you&#39;re interested:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dean Emeritus Raymond Fielding joined The Film School in 1990 and served as the founding permanent dean for 13 years before stepping down in the summer of 2003. Dean Fielding has spent the last 45 years as a professor and/or administrator at six different university film schools, including those of UCLA, USC, University of Iowa, Temple University, University of Houston, and The Florida State University. At the last three of these he and his colleagues created new programs.</p>

<p>Dean Fielding has written or directed films released by Walt Disney Studios, CBS Television and The Public Broadcasting Corporation, and served as a consultant to Universal Studios, United Artists, CBS Television, TransAmerica Corporation, Capital Cities Broadcasting, ABC Television, BBC Television, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and the Hearst Corporation.</p>

<p>Dean Fielding is the author of six books on film technology and history and of more than thirty articles in scholarly journals. He has served as President of the University Film and Video Association, the Society for Cinema Studies and the Association of Industry Film Producers, and as the Vice President of the International Congress of Schools of Cinema and Television. In 1981 he was elected a lifetime member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also set up and ran the Omni Zoetrope special effects studio for Francis Ford Coppolla in the 1970s.  Zavada consulted Fielding, an absolute heavyweight in the industry, to weigh in on the feasibility of alteration.  Here is Fielding&#39;s response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You may quote me if you wish in saying that (1) I
agree with your interpretation of the data and evidence available and with the
conclusions that you have reached, including questions of technical feasibility and
the time line involved, (2) in my judgment there is no way in which manipulation
of these images could have been achieved satisfactorily in 1963 with the
technology then available, (3) if such an attempt at image manipulation of the
footage had occurred in 1963 the results could not possibly have survived
professional scrutiny, and (4) challenges regarding the authenticity of the NARA
footage and assertions of image manipulation, as are suggested by Mr. Healy in
the document you sent me, are technically naïve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the &quot;images showing alteration&quot; you think are persuasive have been debunked over and over again by people with actual knowledge and training in this area, unlike Z film alterationists, all of whom are rank amateurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that seems to be the argument in a nutshell: trust us, we know what we&#39;re talking about, we have the credentials.  </p>

<p>But the first video I linked to shows the inventiveness of Hollywood filmmakers to &quot;fake it&quot; over the years.  And professional opinion is not unanimous, as Horne cites &quot;over 30 experts in the motion picture industry in Hollywood have examined the 35 mm dupe negative of the extant Zapruder film being studied by the informal, ad hoc &quot;Hollywood research group,&quot; and <em>all of them have expressed serious disquiet about the blacked-out areas on the back of JFK&#39;s head</em>---specifically in frames 313, 317, 321, 323, and 329---stating that they have never seen apparent artifacts like these filmed in nature, and that <em>they strongly suggest artificiality, or tampering.</em>&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, as cited by Horne, &quot;Dino Brugioni, the former Chief Information Officer at NPIC in Washington, D.C. (a co-founder of NPIC, and the right-hand man of its first Director, Arthur Lundahl), told researcher Peter Janney in 2009 that at Hawkeyeworks, <strong>&quot;they could do ANYTHING&quot; with motion pictures.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>And, as Horne also helpfully notes, the chain of custody of the film is suspicious because the CIA evidently took custody of the film and it went to the lab where they could do anything with motion picturs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, Secret Service agent &quot;Bill Smith,&quot; who delivered a 16 mm wide unslit double-8 mm format Zapruder film to Homer McMahon at NPIC on Sunday night, November 24th, told McMahon that it had been DEVELOPED AT HAWKEYEWORKS IN ROCHESTER, AND THAT HE HAD COURIERED THE FILM TO NPIC IN WASHINGTON D.C. FROM HAWKEYEWORKS. Rollie&#39;s attempt to define Hawkeyeworks as solely a &quot;Corona&quot; facility is nothing, in my view, but a modified, limited hangout, to use the expressive language of the Watergate era. It is exactly what I would expect the CIA (or Kodak, the prime contractor which ran the facility for the Agency) to say, in an attempt to confuse readers and fuzz-up the issues here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, if Kodak is a prime contractor for the Agency we can&#39;t really expect experts that come from there to really be &quot;independent&quot; when they provide analysis to the government, even if it is &quot;pro bono.&quot;</p>

<p>No, see, citing them would be giving us their NAMES, and some actual QUOTES and OPINIONS.  He makes a bald faced claim and doesn&#39;t even attempt to back it up.  These <em>motion picture experts</em> have yet to say a word about the Zapruder film...why?  Zavadas report came out 15 YEARS AGO.

<p>Nothing wrong with that.  My complaint is you seem to be resting your case mostly on an appeal to authority.  This seems to be a common tactic of the Zapruder film defenders.</p>

<p>As a simple matter of logic, a person without even a High School degree can look at frame 315 for instance, and see that the apparent shot to Kennedy&#39;s head occurs in the front of his head, near his temple.  <a href="http://www.assassinationresearch.com/zfilm/">http://www.assassinationresearch.com/zfilm/</a>  This conflicts with the autopsy findings that show the top of the head blown out and nothing on the temple, and it especially conflicts with the testimony of the Parkland doctors who saw the back of the head blown out.  So one or more of these pieces of evidence has to be faked.  </p>

<p>There are other anomalies, some mentioned in the video I first posted, that I have yet to see sufficient rebuttals to.</p>

<p>Not at all.  The science is out there.  Have a look at it and point out where Zavada and company are wrong.  They are infinitely more qualified than any of the alterationists, and have microscopically studied the original Z film first hand.  The people making claims of alteration (Horne, Lifton, Fetzer, White, Costella) are not qualified in the least.  No photography training, no film training, making their determinations based on copies of copies of copies.  Every single one of their &quot;anomalies&quot; has been debunked thoroughly.</p>

<p>The Muchmore and Nix films corroborate what the Z film shows 100%.  The limo did not stop, the headshot struck from the rear, blowing a cloud of material out in front of the head and leaving the rear of the head completely intact.  Were the Nix and Muchmore films altered too?</p>

<p>Marie Muchmore sold her film of the shooting undeveloped to UPI on November 25th.  UPI had it on a plane for New York, and broadcast it on TV the next morning.  Law enforcement was not even aware of its existence before that point, so alteration would have been impossible.</p>

<p>Nope.  The headshot struck from behind at frame 313, pushing the head forward several inches on impact and blowing an exit wound on the right side of the head in front of the right ear.  The vast majority of material was ejected forward and up, totally inconsistent with a shot from the front.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/UAFlDvp">Here is the moment the headshot strikes (frames 312 and 313).</a>  The head is snapping <em>forward</em>.  Blood is shooting out in <em>front</em> of the head from the exit wound on the right hand side.</p>

<p>Really?  Find the clip of the 4 Parkland doctors reviewing the autopsy photos for Nova in 1988.  All of them admit they were mistaken in their initial assessment.  They all said the same thing when interviewed by Gerald Posner for Case Closed:</p>

<p>The flap of skull and scalp blown out when the headshot hits comes down in front of the right ear, but the blowout is closer to the top of the head.  Basically the entire right side of the head from the top to just above the right ear is what blows out.</p>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t.  There is not a single shred of proof of alteration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope.  The film was out of Zapruders possession for 2 hours on the day of the assassination while it was being developed.  Other than that 2 hour span, he had possession of the original until he sold it to Life magazine the next day.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because no one with any qualifications in film processing or photography has ever claimed it was altered.</p>

<p>Because the lead technician on the team that developed Kodachrome II film studied the original film in the National Archives under a microscope and determined that it was an unaltered in camera original shot with Zapruders Bell &amp; Howell camera to the exclusion of all other cameras.</p>

<p>Because undetectable alteration of a home movie shot in 1963 using 60s era tools would have been impossible.  Men who ran special effects studios in the 60s and 70s have said as much.</p>

<p>Because the men who have claimed alteration have no training in film, no training in photography, and any anomalies they claim to have found have been promptly debunked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The car didn&#39;t stop.  The Nix film doesn&#39;t show a stop.  The Muchmore film doesn&#39;t show a stop.  Were they faked as well? (Hint, search the history of both films if you plan to claim they too were faked)</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t.  2 frames were damaged by Life while making a copy of the original film (208 and 210 I believe), but those frames have been published from first generation copies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Like I said, Zapruder had possession of the original film for the entire day on November 22nd other than the 2 hours it was being developed.  3 copies were made that day.  2 of them went to the secret service and Zapruder kept one for himself.  He sold the original to Life magazine the next morning.</p>

<p>Who made that assertion?  What generation of film were they using?  What credentials did they have?  Tell me it was Jack White, please tell me it was Jack White...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saying thay the tech didn&#39;t exist back then is so naive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it, Rollie Zavada did, as did Professor Raymond Fielding.  Zavada was Standards Director for Imaging Technologies for Eastman Kodak.  He was lead tech on the team that developed Kodachrome II film.  He&#39;s got a laundry list of qualifications, and microscopically examined the original film in the archives.  He found no signs at all that it had been altered.</p>

<p>Fielding was a professor of film at 6 different universities over 45 years, including 13 as Dean of the film school at Florida State.  He set up and ran Omni Zoetrope special effects studio in the 70s for Frances Ford Coppolla.  He says undetectable alteration of an 8mm home movie in 1963 would not have been possible.</p>

<p>Yes.  And this proves my point.  I part ways with many conspiracy theorists in that I don&#39;t think JFK was killed that day.  It was a hoax.  And the absolutely contradictory evidence from the various sources is compelling evidence that witnesses lied and evidence was faked/tapered with.  </p>

<p><strong>The Zapruder film shows a head wound that is not apparent on any of the autopsy photos.  How can this be?</strong>  You yourself admitted the wound appears in front of the ear.  It&#39;s quite obvious the wound appears on the face, near the temple, as depicted in Zapruder.  There appears to be a flap of skin that rolls upward.  This wound does not appear on the autopsy records.</p>

<p>Then we have the testimony of the over a dozen medical doctors who all state the wound occurred at the back of the head (in addition to seeing what looked like an entrance wound on the neck).  I find it incredibly implausible that that number of doctors are going to get this wrong--that they are going to see a hole in the back of the head and miss a hole in the top of the head or on his face.  </p>

<p>Either the body was tampered with or these witnesses were lying.  Or the video evidence was tampered with.  <strong>The hoax was designed so this evidence was inconsistent.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are a number of reasons mainstream media outlets push this kind of news.
1. To keep people with knowledge of conspiracy&#39;s interested.
2. To give their slant on these conspiracy theories to the masses (distract =&gt;manipulate the discustions.)
3. To keep up the facade of giving unpartial news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but it&#39;s the anniversary. It&#39;s sensational and interesting so that&#39;s why they are taking about it. And for what&#39;s it worth nothing can ever really be debunked. You can&#39;t prove a negative, you can gather evidence that shows it highly unlikely but some one will always be there with a new theory. CNN is a business, businesses try to make money. That&#39;s all this is, just cashing in on an anniversary event. </p>

The article really only talks about one guy who is unable to debunk  it, and for fairly obvious reasons too (the people who may have done it also have control over documents which prove/disprove it).

    <div class="md"><p>Well that part of our history is so far removed that many wouldn&#39;t care whether the CIA had some involvement.  The CIA would just argue that &quot;we aren&#39;t that organization any longer&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>No, it wasn&#39;t edited.  The idea is idiotic.</p>

<p>The ARRB on the advice of Doug Horne, hired Rollie Zavada in 1998 to study the film in the National Archives.  Zavada was the lead technician on the team that invented Kodachrome II film, which the Z film was shot on.  Horne thought Zavada would certainly find evidence of revision.</p>

<p>Instead, months later Zavada turned in a 300 page report insisting that the film in the archives was an unaltered in camera original and was shot on Zapruders camera to the exclusion of all other cameras.  Furthermore, he stated that undetectable editing of an 8mm home movie using materials available in 1963 was absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>He did his investigation completely pro bono and was never involved in anything related to the assassination prior to being hired by the ARRB.</p>

<p>His report is available online and his methods are described in detail.  Feel free to read it over and point out where he got it wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that seems to be the argument in a nutshell: trust us, we know what we&#39;re talking about, we have the credentials.  </p>

<p>But the first video I linked to shows the inventiveness of Hollywood filmmakers to &quot;fake it&quot; over the years.  And professional opinion is not unanimous, as Horne cites &quot;over 30 experts in the motion picture industry in Hollywood have examined the 35 mm dupe negative of the extant Zapruder film being studied by the informal, ad hoc &quot;Hollywood research group,&quot; and <em>all of them have expressed serious disquiet about the blacked-out areas on the back of JFK&#39;s head</em>---specifically in frames 313, 317, 321, 323, and 329---stating that they have never seen apparent artifacts like these filmed in nature, and that <em>they strongly suggest artificiality, or tampering.</em>&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, as cited by Horne, &quot;Dino Brugioni, the former Chief Information Officer at NPIC in Washington, D.C. (a co-founder of NPIC, and the right-hand man of its first Director, Arthur Lundahl), told researcher Peter Janney in 2009 that at Hawkeyeworks, <strong>&quot;they could do ANYTHING&quot; with motion pictures.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>And, as Horne also helpfully notes, the chain of custody of the film is suspicious because the CIA evidently took custody of the film and it went to the lab where they could do anything with motion picturs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, Secret Service agent &quot;Bill Smith,&quot; who delivered a 16 mm wide unslit double-8 mm format Zapruder film to Homer McMahon at NPIC on Sunday night, November 24th, told McMahon that it had been DEVELOPED AT HAWKEYEWORKS IN ROCHESTER, AND THAT HE HAD COURIERED THE FILM TO NPIC IN WASHINGTON D.C. FROM HAWKEYEWORKS. Rollie&#39;s attempt to define Hawkeyeworks as solely a &quot;Corona&quot; facility is nothing, in my view, but a modified, limited hangout, to use the expressive language of the Watergate era. It is exactly what I would expect the CIA (or Kodak, the prime contractor which ran the facility for the Agency) to say, in an attempt to confuse readers and fuzz-up the issues here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, if Kodak is a prime contractor for the Agency we can&#39;t really expect experts that come from there to really be &quot;independent&quot; when they provide analysis to the government, even if it is &quot;pro bono.&quot;</p>

<p>My complaint is you seem to be resting your case mostly on an appeal to authority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all.  The science is out there.  Have a look at it and point out where Zavada and company are wrong.  They are infinitely more qualified than any of the alterationists, and have microscopically studied the original Z film first hand.  The people making claims of alteration (Horne, Lifton, Fetzer, White, Costella) are not qualified in the least.  No photography training, no film training, making their determinations based on copies of copies of copies.  Every single one of their &quot;anomalies&quot; has been debunked thoroughly.</p>

<p>The Muchmore and Nix films corroborate what the Z film shows 100%.  The limo did not stop, the headshot struck from the rear, blowing a cloud of material out in front of the head and leaving the rear of the head completely intact.  Were the Nix and Muchmore films altered too?</p>

<p>Marie Muchmore sold her film of the shooting undeveloped to UPI on November 25th.  UPI had it on a plane for New York, and broadcast it on TV the next morning.  Law enforcement was not even aware of its existence before that point, so alteration would have been impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a simple matter of logic, a person without even a High School degree can look at frame 315 for instance, and see that the apparent shot to Kennedy&#39;s head occurs in the front of his head, near his temple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  The headshot struck from behind at frame 313, pushing the head forward several inches on impact and blowing an exit wound on the right side of the head in front of the right ear.  The vast majority of material was ejected forward and up, totally inconsistent with a shot from the front.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/UAFlDvp">Here is the moment the headshot strikes (frames 312 and 313).</a>  The head is snapping <em>forward</em>.  Blood is shooting out in <em>front</em> of the head from the exit wound on the right hand side.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jeIuXPc.jpg">Here is a closeup of the exit wound as it happened.</a></p>

<p>Damage occurring completely in front of the right ear.  Back of the head completely intact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it especially conflicts with the testimony of the Parkland doctors who saw the back of the head blown out. So one or more of these pieces of evidence has to be faked</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ziq3ZQF.jpg">Here is a picture of the rear of Kennedy&#39;s head in Dealey Plaza</a> compared to the recollection of the Parkland doctors.  That&#39;s frames from 3 separate amateur videos of the shooting and a polaroid picture snapped a split second after the headshot, developed immediately and broadcast on live TV within 2 hours of the shooting.</p>

<p>The Parkland doctors were simply mistaken.</p>
