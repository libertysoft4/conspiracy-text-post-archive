<p>What is the point in showing this to First Graders other than to manipulate their thinking?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two possible reasons:</p>

<p>1 - You already said it, manipulation</p>

<p>2 - See which parents have conspiracy beliefs. In short, force the child to watch war propaganda and see which parents come forth saying that it is a lie.</p>

<p>If you are willing to, tell your son to ask that teacher why there were two calls still working well after the U93 crashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I dont agree with what the teacher did, but instead of getting pissed, use it as a tool to teach your child critical thinking. Show your child an image like <a href="http://www.moillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Media-Manipulation-Optical-Illusion1.jpg">this</a> one and explain that there are many perspectives to any given event.  Some people ascribe to the left image, some to the right, but the truth often lies somewhere in the middle. </p>

<p>I understand that a first grader seeing these things may seem a little vulgar, but, I accepted a long time ago that the carefree innocents I experienced as a child is not a luxury my children are going to be allowed to enjoy. The world has just become too politicized and full of war violence and destruction, and they, as the next generation, are at the forefront. There is a battle on for their minds, and we as parents have a responsibility to fight for them to retain an open mind and critical thinking.  </p>

<p>Maybe its not such an awful thing that these children are being exposed to 911, after all it is the pivotal event that has put on on the course we find ourselves today. It opens the door for a dialogue with your child about the virtue of questioning what youre told, and coming to your own conclusions and the folly of blind faith. Obviously 911 is a discussion that is very deep and involved for a first grader, but kids do well with allegory. Things like Aesops fables and offshoots of the originals could be employed to bring a simpler understanding to a complicated issue. </p>

<p>It IS ok to tell your child that their teacher does not know everything. Opinions are like assholes and everyones got one. (or bellybuttons if you prefer). Children arent so fragile that they cant handle a little reality, in fact, sheltering your children from it may do more harm than good. They are natural skeptics. If you empower that natural urge to ask questions, I promise they will, and you will give them a vital tool to combat manipulation by the system. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an oldster here that had the Space Shuttle event blow up in my life and the life of my oldest child that day. It was so hyped here and we we&#39;re all so excited about a Teacher in Space!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shuttle did not explode in the common definition of that word. There was no shock wave, no detonation, no “bang” — viewers on the ground just heard the roar of the engines stop as the shuttle’s fuel tank tore apart, spilling liquid oxygen and hydrogen, which formed a huge fireball at an altitude of 46,000 ft. (Some television documentaries later added the sound of an explosion to these images.) But both solid-fuel strap-on boosters climbed up out of the cloud, still firing and unharmed by any explosion. Challenger itself was torn apart as it was flung free of the other rocket components and turned broadside into the Mach 2 airstream. Individual propellant tanks were seen exploding — but by then, the spacecraft was already in pieces.</p>
