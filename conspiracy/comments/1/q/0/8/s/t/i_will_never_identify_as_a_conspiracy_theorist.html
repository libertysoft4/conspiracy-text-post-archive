        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This subject has been buzz lately on this sub and it&#39;s a problem. &quot;Conspiracy theorist&quot; is a term used to throw people into one big group making it vastly easier to discredit, dismantle, and disinform those who seek the truth. I have never called myself a conspiracy theorist nor do I rarely use the word conspiracy. The people who use those words the most are hardest people to convince about anything going on because they&#39;re too busy throwing the label on everyone and anything outside the realm of &quot;normal&quot; thought. I try my best to have an open mind and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve ultimately been led to this sub. To hell with anyone who calls me a conspiracy theorist, I&#39;m a fucking realist. </p>

<p>This stickied post, these people searching for the emblem of a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.... I mean come on.</p>

My gf got me thinking about this, and also I have heard from psychic&#39;s that the end is coming (not sure how the ppl of this sub feel about psychics), but I just want some evidence from a 3rd party. thanks in advance if you take the time to reply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that&#39;s the general idea I believe too. I&#39;m most curious about the destruction, at the moment. That&#39;s what my girlfriend is freaking out about.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh well don&#39;t panic! Destruction comes in many forms an probably won&#39;t be as apparent most of the time. We have developed the ideas and understandings of thought, technology, biology, society, you name it on massive grand scales an this comes with a price. </p>

<p>Do you play games? Well if you do/don&#39;t there is a well observed phenomenon similar to this kind of transitional creative destruction. When you start a new character usually that character will hit a wall of sorts an either massive revamping or a fresh start is needed to progress, we can see this aspect of creation and destruction in our lives also. For extrasimple example with internet infrastructure, dial up was basically destroyed with the widespread development of dsl/cable technology. So not really destruction in the popular sense, but that could follow. Its just important not to seek doom as it is easy to find. Its the future that eludes us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that you don&#39;t believe in psychics, as I&#39;d bet there are plenty who are fake. I have been to a few, and my mom&#39;s friend has the gift as well. My experiences leave me doubt that they have the abilities they claim, and even strengthened my fading religious/spiritual beliefs. Not that the point of seeing a psychic is to obtain useless facts about the past or present, but I have been told exact dates of events, exact names, exact careers, etc. </p>

<p>As for the pen in the pocket. I&#39;m not sure if real psychics work that way... it&#39;s not magic, and everyone&#39;s abilities differ. It&#39;s mostly human-related things. They don&#39;t always see things crystal clear. Like my mom&#39;s friend (who may seem very weird) just randomly told my mom &quot;Don&#39;t walk with stones at night&quot;. My mom&#39;s reaction &quot;Okkk, whatever&quot;. A few days later my mom destroyed her leg from trying to move a millstone (around 7 Pm, it was almost fully dark) and couldn&#39;t walk for a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t adhere to labels. Period. </p>

<p>I acknowledge a handful of conspiracies are indeed factual, based upon irrefutable evidence that contradicts the official narrative. I acknowledge some others tend to have enough circumstantial evidence to make them seem plausible, or at least possible, worth taking into consider at the very least.</p>

<p>I also acknowledge there are numerous other so-called &quot;theories&quot; that are complete &amp; utter bull shit. Now, just because there are elements, when referred to in a generalization, that may be incorrect, that does not necessarily make the entirety of that particular topic invalid. That would be a dogmatic point of view. Skeptics who automatically dismiss any idea labeled a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; by others are not <em>true</em> skeptics, but rather religious-like in their convictions, and more often then not are nothing more than ego-driven contrarians.  </p>

<p>I have a motto, I often remind myself: <em>Never dismiss any notion outright based on prejudice or pre-conceived notions. Furthermore, never take any one source as gospel, regardless of how reputable, official or agreeable it may seem.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares about the label.</p>

<p>Do identify myself with &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;? Sure! as well as any other labels out there.</p>

<p>Ultimately it is about what you know and what you want.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> YOU are making a mistake here. You might think the label is derogatory here and you would be right, so you think it would be better to move away from it.</p>

<p>BUT moving away from it is not without consequence.</p>

<p>Sure you might call yourself a realist or whatever but then you would not have any connection, no spirit of community.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not a conspiracy theorist, I am not like all those people that believe those silly stuff, I don&#39;t believe, I know the true stuff, facts, the real deal, I am not like them, <strong>I am marginalized,alone, impotent</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like the <strong>blacks</strong>, same thing, lots of labels, negro,nigga,black, african-american, people of color. But they are not the &quot;normal&quot; they are the oppressed, but they have no community to support each other.</p>

<p>They have none because they don&#39;t identify with negro,nigga,black, african-american, people of color, they are something else, alone and marginalized.</p>

<p>I say call me a conspiracy nut.</p>

<p>I say nigga powaa!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear what you&#39;re saying.  It&#39;s a dismissive, derogatory term meant to discredit those it&#39;s applied to.</p>

<p>But frankly, I&#39;m fine with it.  I&#39;m not someone who is victimized.  I&#39;m a well educated white male who has never had any real external impediments to my own successes.  My usage of the moniker &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; isn&#39;t self empowering the way a black guy calling himself nigga or a gay guy referring to himself as faggot might be.  It&#39;s simply an ideology that I identify with. </p>

<p>When one defines themselves with a title as such, it can be self limiting, but part of being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is being forever skeptical.  Show me evidence and let me evaluate that evidence based on available empirical knowledge and context.  That&#39;s wisdom.  I can identify falsehoods and errors in my thinking and others&#39; arguments.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a pragmatist and I&#39;m a skeptic.  I can deconstruct events and language and talking points and philosophies and posit on outcomes.  I know enough to know when I don&#39;t know enough, but I know enough to judge when what I&#39;m being told is not accurate.  I have a solid understanding of the ideologies which have sway.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my knowledge and understanding and passion to learn more that makes me a conspiracy theorist.  I enjoy deciphering the codes and following power networks and strategies.  Knowing what possibilities wait beyond the horizon is valuable and to some, interest in it is innate.  As someone who is tempered and not easily swayed, even by my own steadfast beliefs, I don&#39;t mind being labeled similarly to others who might tend towards more extremes or zealotry- because I feel that thought is vital to progress and should not be stifled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, but I refer to myself as a conspiracy theorist. despite, that what is actually covered by the term &#39;conspiracy theory&#39;, isnt a theory.
 I agree the term has been completely propagandized, so heavily that, in the minds of many people, it means something along the lines of,
 &#39;&#39;A crazy whackjob that commonly believes; the moon landing was fake, also Elvis is still alive and having tea parties with bigfoot, and anything they say about the government is equally untrue, false, only an idiot would believe, and bordering on terrorism&#39;&#39;. This despite no conspiracy theorists that I have met, consider these seriously. </p>

<p>My main point on being termed a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;, is that many maligned groups of people throughout history, have taken derogatory terms,  meant to belittle or insult and used those terms themselves. Turned them around on people that use the term to injure. Using the same term, with a form of dignity and honour, whilst reviled and laughed at. Yes, I am a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>History is filled with hated people that had ideas that weren&#39;t popular at the time, that turned out to be right. I absolutely believe the truth comes out in the end, even if it takes a long time. I firmly wish to be part of the group, that is calling out the criminal actions of the global elite at this point in time. I believe it will one day be impossible to deny the truth, spoken by many so called &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use conspiracy theories as a form of entertainment.  I do research and take every detail of information with a grain (or a pound) of salt until I can independently verify it.  Sometimes I get things wrong, and sometimes I realize (usually before bedtime) I am letting my mind run wild, but I believe it helps my imagination and lets me critically analyze all information that passes by my nose from any and all sources.</p>

<p>What really got me started on the Conspiracy craze, that I enjoy so much, was the &quot;discovery&quot; that FIAT currency is created out of thin air by banks, and has no real backing other than a pre-existing belief that the paper notes actually have a value.</p>

<p>Things such as Aliens and Monsters are very entertaining on dark nights when I want to give myself chills in believing the possibility there is a conspiracy and how drastic our world would change it the &#39;truth&#39; came out.  Hoaxes are just as fun to follow as they are slowly debunked but add to the bigger story.</p>

<p>When you start to look into any conspiracy, especially in the idea of a movie script style plot, you can easily find interest and entertainment from a conspiracy story inside a conspiracy, inside another conspiracy.  Are there even more levels?</p>

<p>Call me a Conspiracy Theorist if you want, or any other label you need to create and group people into to feel safer in your world.  It will make you feel better to believe that everything can be labeled and generalized so easily.  I know that nothing is black and white, and anyone that wants to view the world this way, is just trying to protect their mind from being just as confused as everyone else.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I thought at some point I would be an adult and eventually know everything, and the world would make perfect sense.  Like the 4 different, but perfect blocks would all fit into the 4 different, but perfect holes; No more than 1 block for each hole, and no remaining holes left over.  A clear and exact explanation for every possible situation.  I grew up and realized you can&#39;t know everything, and the people that tell you they know things for a fact are very much blinded to other perspectives.  Maybe the circle block is not supposed to fit through the square hole, or maybe you never even considered the idea that it is possible.</p>
