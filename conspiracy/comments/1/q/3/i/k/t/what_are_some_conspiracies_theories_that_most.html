    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s not a real mind blowing one but currently the FDA is passing a bill that will effectively shut down the online sale of e-cigs, juices and replacement equipment, effectively crushing the industry except those shitty disposables you buy at gas stations. Now the reasoning they gave for this was they don&#39;t have enough data on the effects of &quot;vaping&quot; and since the nicotine in the juices for refillable e-cigs is extracted from tobacco they are labeling it a tobacco (which you can also extract nicotine from tomatoes and eggplants, it&#39;s just easier with tobacco). Vaping has been getting people of smoking cigarettes and it&#39;s pretty clear that big tobacco lobbying has pushed the FDA into dropping a ban hammer on vaporizing. </p>

The true secret is meant to refer to the near destruction of the Church starting at the very highest levels.  Most traditionally minded Catholics consider this to be a reference to Vatican II.  The released fake secret says something else entirely (as would be expected of the Vatican II hierarchy).</p>

<p>This is trolling, it is not something people take seriously in this or any subreddit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to do the decent thing &amp; provide a logical argument, the evidence provided for the moon landing is greater than pointing out it flaws in them, because to disprove something you need evidence, &amp; scientifically speaking, inconsistencies in evidence does not disprove the subject of the evidence presented, in other words, NASA went to the moon, provided evidence, so to debate this fact, you need evidence they did not land there, that is how scientific method works, if you have a claim, the burden of proof is on you.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you can afford a telescope, learn the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsjcoords.html">coordinates</a> of the LZ, &amp; look for yourself, or, if you understand rocket science, build a rocket, go there, &amp; prove there is no evidence of a landing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not SO much on the fence as not 100% about what actually happened. I certainly don&#39;t believe the official story, but I don&#39;t have enough information to compete the whole picture. Maybe because it was way before my time. 9/11 for example I would be happy betting the house that it was an inside job and have no problems understanding how and why the government would do such a thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My two favorite ones are that nuclear weapons have never worked but this fact is hidden because if the huge amount of money they get to make tubes full of inert metal and because of the psychological value of the fear they foster. To investigate, read about Hiroshima and the bomb and answer why the city looks just like it was firebombed and stone structures are still standing, including the bank of Japan which was almost directly under the blast and is still standing and in use today!!!  Also where is the radioactivity?  </p>

<p>Second, we don&#39;t have to fear some NWO style depopulation procedure because they are already doing it. The population of the globe is &quot;7 billion&quot; but how do you verify that?  All U.S. big cities are declining. How did India quadruple its population in 50-60 years?  That just seems unlikely. Food production hasn&#39;t increased that fast. Are they just skinnier now?  Also the more population, the more money they &quot;need&quot; for social programs and more opportunity for embezzlement. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about this. Watch this video which recaps a lot of nuclear tests and see for yourself if they look &quot;real&quot;.  They look as hokey ad any B movie special effects from the 1950&#39;s. Surrounding clouds don&#39;t move, there are close ups of the sunrise over the ocean that are spliced in the represent the explosion. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywuM-UYySM&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywuM-UYySM&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>

<p>Also, look up the photo of the Hiroshima explosion. The sun is up at the peak of the sky, yet the explosion was at 8:15 a.m.  It also looks like to mushroom clouds stacked on top of each other. </p>

<p>As for eyewitness testimony, there is a lot of descriptions of fire raining down, opening the door and seeing fire everywhere, but precious little of any explosion. Later accounts may have been coached or to get compensation.</p>

<p>The NY times just ran an article showing no genetic damage in Hiroshima survivors over 40 years later. Cancer rates increased AT THE SAME RATE AS PRACTICALLY EVERYWHERE ELSE. </p>

<p>I can provide a lot more links if you would like, but this info is not too hard to find. </p>

<p>The past 70 years has also featured 1000&#39;s of nukes being assembled, tested, transported etc. with no accidental explosions or terrorists etc. That is an amazing safety record - as good as the 100% safety record of the 7 Apollo moonshots with no loss of life or accidents. That is the safest NASA program of all time!  Why don&#39;t ER still use the Saturn V rockets?  We &quot;lost&quot; the plans!  (seriously). </p>

<p>You think they had radiation because that is what they said.  This article says otherwise.</p>

<p>The time the bomb was dropped was 8:15 am.  The hiroshima pics which are readily available show a sun much higher in the sky than 8:15 in the morning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool, I will check it out. I&#39;ve been on the fence for a while with the Apollo thing, The Van Allen radiation belt, no dust kicked up from the thrusters etc. Then Mythbusters did their thing and it got me thinking again... &quot;Maybe we did go&quot; but, when it comes down to it I just don&#39;t think we had the technology to go in the &#39;60s. What do you think did it happen? I will watch this video today! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks, that was hilarious, i needed some comic relief. That guys suffering from a bad case of the Dunning-Kruger effect, if that&#39;s all it took to &quot;settle the issue&quot; for you I&#39;d love to see the &quot;evidence&quot; for the other issues you have settled in your mind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sarcasm aside, I assumed more people would watch a short video than read a bunch of articles etc.  So I think it is a bit patonizing to assume that is all I have to have to &quot;settle&quot; the issue.  </p>

<p>Do those explosions look real to you??  What about Hiroshima?</p>
