<p>But can anyone give me a proper definition to zionism? <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism">This</a> Wiki page, I know wikipedia is a despised source but check the sources yourself &amp; show me their unreliable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is a form of nationalism of Jews and Jewish culture that supports a Jewish nation state in the territory defined as the Land of Israel. Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies and has advocated the return of Jews to Israel as a means for Jews to be a majority in their own nation, and to be liberated from antisemitic discrimination, exclusion, and persecution that had historically occurred in the diaspora.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, most if the time wikipedia is awesome. I read a study awhike back that checked the accuracy of a few encyclopedias, and wikipedia scored higher than oxford and websters. But anyways... Back to your question..</p>

<p>Many people equate zionism to being jews. Or to a national pride for the jewish. This is not correct.</p>

<p>Zionism is a movement. It was started by the european jews (many who were persecuted during the holocaust) called the ashkenazi jews. They claim that their ancestors from biblical times migrated to europe and spread their faith. Thus, they claim, they have a divine right to claim israel as their promised land. So, the movement started, zionism was born as the european jews moved to israel and kicked the palestinians out. This movement is Zionism.</p>

<p>There was a study done by geneticists not too long ago, that found there was no genetic traces of the biblical jews in the genomes of the ashkenazi jews. Thus, it led some people to believe that the ashkenazi jews had no divine right to the land of israel, and that caused these people to see Zionism as an infiltration, an invasion. </p>

<p>This gets very deep, and i just scratched the surface for you, as the conspiracy theory behind this is vast. It involves the jihadists, and mentions that this form of invasion is the reason behind their jihad. In fact, many &quot;terrorists&quot; claim that their terrorists attacks are in retaliation for this zionism inflitration. Hence why they call their enemies (like us) zionists. </p>

<p>It is extremely important to note that zionism is not a religion. It is not a race. It is a movement. a zionist does not necessarily have to be a jew, for someone can support the movement without being a jew, and thus, they are a zionist. Just like a catholic person does not need to be an american, or a white person. A zionist does not have to be a jew.</p>

<p>Also of note, because of this common misconception of the term zionism, many label opposers of the movement as antisemetic. This is just as false, because to be antizionist is not to be antijew. Also, the term &quot;semitic&quot; refers to a group of languages and ethnicities, mainly in the middle east, which includes hebrew (language of the jews) the jews themselves, the arabian language, and others...</p>

<p>This just proves how easily words can be warped to further an agenda...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I think it mentions it being a movement in the wiki, but you summed that up nicely &amp; clearly, I guess I should reiterate my question as, why do people use the term to further anti-semitic agendas, specifically white supremacists, especially considering a zionist is not a race, &amp; better yet, why are these people on reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as far as the theory goes, the zionists plan to dominate the world. They own much of the banking system (which is why many say the jews own the world...etc. etc.) It goes on as to say that the zionists use the anti defaming league (a real organization within the UN) to help label anyone in opposition to their aquistion of world dominance as antisemitic in order to gain sympathy from the uneducated. Basically, the term antisemitic is used to label and discredit those who oppose, much like how ther label &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is used to make those opposed to official stories as crackpots.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter how much evidence and fact-based explanations you present if no one believes you because they think you are just crazy or a biggoted racist. Thus, it allows them to continue on their agenda for the NWO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be a global conspiracy not involving one ethnicity or religion but all of them.</p>

<p>Its just the fact that so many people are ignorant and dont value the views of others when it seems like its in opposition to their own beliefs. There are different takes of the zionism conspiracy theory, and some say that there is a coalition of people behind the zionists, using them as a scapegoat, in order to establish the NWO. For this take, the people behind zionism dont even need to believe zionism itself. They just need the people to believe in zionism. To create conflict. </p>

<p>Check out this site, but before you discredit it, take it for what its worth. There is some interesting concepts, such as create conflict between two people, without them knowing you are the conflicts creator. Then, you propose a solution to &quot;their problem&quot; and in doing so, you establish an effective manipulation. This guy says some weird stuff, but like i said, there are interesting concepts in here, and you have to go through many different pages... It takes awhile, but bear with it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not sure how they connected the zionists to the banks, but i think it stems from the rothschild family, who are undoubtedly amongst the most wealthy in the world.</p>

<p>Rothschild is germanic, from &quot;Rot&quot; which means &quot;Red,&quot; and &quot;Schild&quot; which means &quot;Sign.&quot; Their last name in german is &quot;red sign&quot;. They are of german descent. Jewish, too, i believe. But from there i just dont remember. But its not a far step, from that and hitler and the banks... It even goes as far as England, though i dont remember how they claim the rothschilds bought england. If my memory serves me correctly, though, the rothschilds owned a bank and during the great depression they offered to bail out the u.s. government, creating The Fed. its straight forward from there, but ill have to dig again to find their connections..</p>

<p>You answered your own question.  This is why it is important to do your own research.</p>

<p>You <strong>should</strong> look up the dual citizenships of the legislators and see if anything looks out of place.  (hint:  there are not a lot of other dual citizens)</p>

<p>If evidence is found many bankers are jewish? what would that prove &amp; what would the solution be? </p>

<p>My concern over this is because <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust">this</a> happened, &amp; I&#39;m worried people use the term Zionism falsely to spread anti-semitic ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already pointed out, the term Zionism only applies to the Israel/Palestine. Indeed media &amp; banks are controlled, and your not blaming an ethnicity, then I have no confusion, but zionism does not apply to global events, if you think it does, then that is your view, I have mine &amp; we will have to agree to disagree, </p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t like where blaming Zionism for every little event that happens, goes, because Hitler in fact blamed all of Germanys problems on &quot;Zionism&quot; &amp; I&#39;m not afraid to say that here.</p>

<p>You said that in the form of a question, implying I said it, therefore you said it, misinterpreting what I said, when in fact I never said it does not exist, just that your mistaken as to what it means when it comes to world events. </p>

<p>If I were an upstanding Black guy and I see a group of thug niggas gang banging,...Do I identify with these &quot;niggas&quot; ? Am I unable to call a spade a spade? Jews just like Blacks are threatened by no one more than their own race...</p>

<p>With black people, it is that they &quot;all steal and are all potentially criminals up to no good&quot;...With Jews it is that they are &quot;money grubbing Moneychangers&quot;...And the reason those sterotypes exist is because of the actions of certain members of our respective races.</p>

<p>In this world there are many types of people, but when it comes down to it there are only really 2...You are either cool, or you are an asshole...Jews and or any race of people who just live their lives like any respectable person are cool....Jews who run central banking scams and enslave entire populations with debt are ASSHOLES... and it is deathly important that I as a Jewish person differentiate the difference between the two....or in other words</p>

<p>&quot;hey muther fucker, don&#39;t put the blame on me, I don&#39;t own a central bank and I&#39;m not enslaving the world with false debt, it was these guys over here, and yes they happen to be of Jewish descent, don&#39;t throw my ass in the oven, but I will help you find those responsible for this crime and I will light the pilot....You do realize that by bringing a mere 2500 people to justice that a world of Billions would be able to live in peace and prosperity?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionists are people who believe there should be a Jewish state in the Middle East at any cost.  They are the people behind apartheid in Palestine.  They are obviously predominantly Jewish, but not always -- VP Joe Biden, for instance, has announced that he is a Zionist in a speech late last year or earlier this year.</p>

<p><strong>I think it is extremely important to note that not all Jews are Zionists!</strong>  However, influential Zionists (such as the people in charge of the state of Israel) would have you believe all Jews are Zionists and anyone with anti-Zionist ideas are therefore also anti-Semites.  </p>

<p>I see a lot of people on this forum badmouthing Jews and I think they really mean to be focusing their frustrations against Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No (because the end of the world isn&#39;t actually going to happen because of Israel being inhabited only by Jewish people).  But our government applies a double standard to foreign aid which allows us to fund Israel against our own interests because we have a dense population of Zionists/sympathizers in our government.

<p>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic hoax purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination.

<p><a href="http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/examiner.htm">http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/examiner.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Protocols Decision Washed Out
Press and Radio Silent on Appeal Finding</p>

<p>Great publicity was given throughout the world in 1935 to a decision in the Swiss Courts that the documents known as &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; were a forgery; that the judge had described the contents as &quot;ridiculous nonsense&quot;; and that the Protocols had been condemned as an offence against public morals.</p>

<p>Even in remote New Zealand numerous newspapers at that time published long articles on what they termed an &quot;Historic Forgery&quot;; and addresses were similarly given over the radio system proclaiming loudly that the Protocols had been shown to be baseless.</p>

<p>We are now at the end of February, 1938, but the writer can recall nothing in the daily papers, and he has heard nothing over the radio system, telling him that the Protocols verdict given on May 14, 1935, was reversed by the Berne Court of Appeal on November 1 last.</p>

<p>When the decision went one way it was news fit for all the world to hear: a subject for special articles and radio broadcasts. When it went the other way it ceased to be news at all.</p>

<p>What the Protocols Are</p>

<p>To those unfamiliar with them it may be explained that the Protocols were first published in English in 1920 by Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode, long printers to the British Government. They attracted very considerable attention, and the London &quot;Times&quot;, in reviewing them in a lengthy article on May 3, 1920, stated that its representative had inspected in the British Museum an edition of the Protocols published in Russia by Professor Sergius Nilus in 1905, and bearing the Museum&#39;s date stamp of receipt of August 10, 1906.</p>

<p><strong>The &quot;Times&quot; attached importance to this positive evidence of the existence of the Protocols in 1906, because the Protocols contain a programme for the conquest of the world by subterfuge, and of this programme, world events from 1906 to 1920 were a fulfilment.</strong> That is the whole significance of the Protocols. The plan contained in them goes on getting itself fulfilled.</p>

<p>If the Protocols were considered significant in 1920 because of the course of world events between 1906 and 1920, the course of events between 1920 and 1938 makes them immensely more significant to-day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and from 1938 to today, again a fulfilment. wow that is some prophetic hoax we have here that has been and is coming true every year, for over 100 years.</p>

<p>sounds more like a blueprint to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism is a little like White Power but exclusively for Jews.  Do a little thought experiment right now - Imagine some white guy wearing a Confederate Flag hat talking about how the white people are being culturally destroyed and need a nation of their own so that their race isn&#39;t wiped out.  Now, if you are like most people you probably think that the guy is ignorant and hate filled.  The Zionist is just like this backwoods redneck, but when anyone points that out they are accused of &quot;anti-semitism.&quot;  </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s take this thought experiment a little further.  Imagine this White Pride guy actually gets a movement strong enough that he actually gets his wish - a country for white people.  So they move into a country where people are already living - we&#39;ll say it is predominantly a black area (let&#39;s say South Africa) - they treat all the Black people that have been living there for hundreds of years like second class citizens.  Well, we don&#39;t have to treat this like a thought experiment anymore because this event is a historical fact.  There was a word for it:  Apartheid. </p>

<p>Protocols Decision Washed Out
Press and Radio Silent on Appeal Finding</p>

<p>Great publicity was given throughout the world in 1935 to a decision in the Swiss Courts that the documents known as &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; were a forgery; that the judge had described the contents as &quot;ridiculous nonsense&quot;; and that the Protocols had been condemned as an offence against public morals.</p>

<p>Even in remote New Zealand numerous newspapers at that time published long articles on what they termed an &quot;Historic Forgery&quot;; and addresses were similarly given over the radio system proclaiming loudly that the Protocols had been shown to be baseless.</p>

<p>We are now at the end of February, 1938, but the writer can recall nothing in the daily papers, and he has heard nothing over the radio system, telling him that the Protocols verdict given on May 14, 1935, was reversed by the Berne Court of Appeal on November 1 last.</p>

<p>When the decision went one way it was news fit for all the world to hear: a subject for special articles and radio broadcasts. When it went the other way it ceased to be news at all.</p>

<p>What the Protocols Are</p>

<p>To those unfamiliar with them it may be explained that the Protocols were first published in English in 1920 by Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode, long printers to the British Government. They attracted very considerable attention, and the London &quot;Times&quot;, in reviewing them in a lengthy article on May 3, 1920, stated that its representative had inspected in the British Museum an edition of the Protocols published in Russia by Professor Sergius Nilus in 1905, and bearing the Museum&#39;s date stamp of receipt of August 10, 1906.</p>

<p><strong>The &quot;Times&quot; attached importance to this positive evidence of the existence of the Protocols in 1906, because the Protocols contain a programme for the conquest of the world by subterfuge, and of this programme, world events from 1906 to 1920 were a fulfilment.</strong> That is the whole significance of the Protocols. The plan contained in them goes on getting itself fulfilled.</p>

<p>If the Protocols were considered significant in 1920 because of the course of world events between 1906 and 1920, the course of events between 1920 and 1938 makes them immensely more significant to-day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and from 1938 to today, again a fulfilment. wow that is some prophetic hoax we have here that has been and is coming true every year, for over 100 years.</p>

<p>sounds more like a blueprint to me.</p>

<p>I linked to the article, Zionism is simply jewish nationalism, it has nothing to do with 911, Israeli &amp; American citizenship doesn&#39;t tell me anything, what about officials with British, German or any other citizenship?</p>

<p>You answered your own question.  This is why it is important to do your own research.</p>

<p>You <strong>should</strong> look up the dual citizenships of the legislators and see if anything looks out of place.  (hint:  there are not a lot of other dual citizens)</p>
