        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As the Title says, Reddit is being heavily censored by small handfuls of Moderators. Moderators should not be allowed to induce censorship. Their jobs should be cleaning up the SubReddits and making sure the general rules are followed, but their ability to introduce new drastic rules should be up to user votes. </p>

<p>This is a user oriented website, and as such was made popular due to it&#39;s open ended platform. This is being ruined, and we the users should be able to do something about this.</p>

<p>Small private subreddits are a different story in my opinion, I&#39;m speaking more of the stock SubReddits that all new users are added to, as well as very large SubReddits that have become the backbone of Reddit in general. There needs to be some sort of way to stop this, as It&#39;s ruining Reddit and sending the wrong message to it&#39;s users. And hey, It&#39;s us the users that make this place what it is right?</p>

<p>The only thing I can see negative about this relates to smaller subreddits where the user who created that Sub wants to have control over it, which I don&#39;t disagree with. </p>

<p>So I guess what I&#39;m trying to propose is some sort of user oriented voting system where a Moderator can suggest a new rule set and the users can vote on it over a time frame of something a week or two. ( You have to remember we&#39;re not all daily visitors and major rule changes should be open to everyone. ) But this would only affect SubReddits with a certain user threshold, and any default SubReddit.</p>

<p>I would love feedback and opinions regarding this, specific ideas on a system that could work, and alternatives to keeping Reddit user friendly. Small groups of moderators with no transparency should not have the amount of control they currently do. Abuse has been rampant lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% mate, but Reddit is an already established group of large amounts of people and can be utilized to spread information quite efficiently because of that. It&#39;s a shame that it&#39;s under attack in the way it currently is.</p>

<p>At the very least we can be vocal about this and let other people know what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Other great platforms for spreading information such as YouTube are dealing with the same issues. It&#39;s not something we should just accept and ignore in my opinion. </p>

<p>I doubt I&#39;ll change anything by making these posts, but if I make even a couple people slightly more aware of what&#39;s going on around them It&#39;ll have been worth my effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Try to read and understand my comment before downvoting.</strong> </p>

<p>Moderation is essential to keeping any subreddit to turning into the old <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>, full of memes and low quality posts. </p>

<p>Imagine if jij (<a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> mod) put changing the sub down to the vote, that sub never would&#39;ve been fixed. </p>

<p>There aren&#39;t any voting systems that wouldn&#39;t let the sub be overrun by trolls and morons. </p>

<p>Edit: Don&#39;t forget that this is the internet, the place where people will vote to the detriment of any poll for lulz. </p>

<p>Imagine if this sub put it to the vote on whether or not mods should delete posts. Any guess as to how that vote would go?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Note the downvotes in absence of critical response. OP agreed with me, yet downvotes are a go just because I made a disagreement. Would you choose to censor dissent? </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I agree with Rockran. All Subs need a certain level of moderation. He agrees with the general message here, he&#39;s just explaining the logical issues that would arise with what we&#39;re suggesting. We need to discuss those negative issues just the same as we need to discuss the positive aspects.</strong></p>

<p>I agree, but look at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> banning a plethora of domain names for reasons such as poor journalism. Poor journalism should simply be downvoted by us the users rather than censored completely. I agree some of those domains are questionable, but again, the idea of Reddit is that its users will downvote those submissions.</p>

<p>There are currently groups going through certain SubReddits and downvoting every new submission. It was happening in <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> less than a week ago. Sure there will always be people out there or groups doing things like this, but at the same time we need to make things more open or small groups will be allowed to get away with whatever they want regardless. Either way things can be corrupted, but the way I&#39;m proposing will at least be more transparent. The moderators suggesting rule changes should have to come forward as individuals rather than hiding in anonymity. </p>

<p>And restricting memes, and low quality posts is one thing, but banning lists of domains from being submitted is another. Which is why I suggested that <em>major</em> rule changes should be up for vote, but less severe restrictions would be up to moderators as per usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your main idea of the community deciding upon rules is that that just opens the doors to manipulation. </p>

<p>If a mod asks the sub whether or not they agree with the rule of: <em>&quot;Should the news site [something] be banned from being posted to this sub?&quot;</em></p>

<p>Then a manipulator can just vote yes a hundred thousand times - And now it looks like the community supports the rule. </p>

<p>Asking the community for a vote doesn&#39;t solve anything, but makes it much easier for manipulators to appear to be normal users. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> How wonderful is it that I receive downvoted for supporting moderation. Believing in self-moderation without any moderator intervention whatsoever is a pipedream which has been PROVEN time and time again to not work. How about you explain your position before downvoting? </p>

<p><strong>This subreddit is moderated</strong>, imagine what would happen if it weren&#39;t. </p>

<p><a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> is worse now. The moderator did it no great service. He broke it.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s completely beside the point. <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> is very different from the topic in the OP. That was about &quot;cleaner&quot; posts. This topic is about censorship - removing well thought out posts, often posts with thousands of upvotes, for... what reason, exactly?</p>

<p>Moderation is important, yes. But that is not what is happening. Censorship is happening.</p>

<p>If reddit is truly a service to its users, then its users should have some say in how it is run. Moderators run amok is bad. Moderators pulling stuff because they or TPTB don&#39;t like it is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Users should demand it be fixed or together we should find a better place to spend our time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. </p>

<p>If you observe my main comments in this thread, you&#39;ll see that despite initially opposing the OP, I didn&#39;t make opinions against the OP&#39;s further rebuttals, yet I still got downvoted. </p>

<p>I find that a rather bizarre phenomenon. What are your thoughts on the matter?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to get you down in the dumps but trying to get the average users on reddit aware of the rampant censorship is like re arranging chairs on the titanic while its sinking.

We need to create a subreddit where we can voice our grievances and hopefully use those to our advantage to create a free and fair Reddit.com.  It could be like the ACLU or Internal Affairs of Reddit.  Those moderators caught abusing the rules of there sub Reddit could face banning of the sub Reddit they create.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a developer I&#39;ve been considering building something like this for quite a while now.  I think we need an open-ended site where the aspects of control are transparent to the users that are subject to it.  Those in charge are voted in or out by the mass.  Those in charge have their administrative history in plain view for scrutiny.  This way the system itself forces accountability by every member who is participating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> start holding mod elections.</p>

<p>aside from the obvious issues with default/frontpage subs, the first time i really notices the moderation filter was when <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> start banning political videos and a number of other big subs banned content relating to Occupy.  They said, &quot;if you want to post about occupy go to r/occupy&quot;.  That exactly how the filter bubble works.  </p>

<p>People come here to be exposed to new and important issues that they wouldn&#39;t necessarily have access to elsewhere, and then it&#39;s censored.</p>
