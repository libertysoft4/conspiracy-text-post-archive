        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you didn&#39;t already know, a man named Paul CIAnCIA killed a TSA &quot;officer&quot; a week ago today. This happened at LAX. Today, the TSA will be gumming up the works with a ceremony to honor the first &quot;officer&quot; to be killed &quot;in the line of duty.&quot; I find this infuriating, but let me explain why.</p>

<p>I understand completely that what happened was and is a tragedy. No matter how we feel about the TSA or other government programs, no one needs to be murdered over it. What I <em>do</em> have a problem with is this notion they&#39;re instilling that TSA agents are legitimate officers who perform a &quot;service to our nation&quot; as a local news station described it and when killed are described as being killed &quot;in the line of duty&quot; as though they are police or soldiers. Now with this tragedy they&#39;re talking about <strong>arming</strong> these people and giving them license to fire weapons, because militarization of our airports is exactly what we need.</p>

<p>So, in a nutshell: I hate this. I hate this air they&#39;re trying to give these workers as though their job is so beneficial to society. By all means, pay respects to the man who was killed, but not like this. We might as well have a public ceremony and moment of silence for fallen fast food workers.</p>

<p>I hope I haven&#39;t come off as a bad person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it from the dead guy&#39;s POV.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just a man. He&#39;s doing his job. His job, as he sees it, is to ensure that nobody getting onto an airplane in the USA can hijack it, hurt anyone, or kill anyone on it.</p>

<p>In his mind, he&#39;s clearly performing a public service. In many minds, he is.</p>

<p>Some jackhole then saunters into the airport, guns blazing, and takes this guy out. The reason for the jackhole&#39;s actions are irrelevant to the dead guy. He was just doing his job - adding whatever layer of safety and security he can add to air travel.</p>

<p>He can have his moment of silence.</p>

<p>No, they&#39;re stopping the activities of hundreds of airports to do this moment of silence, or rather that they are imposing this moment of silence on millions of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the entire point of the post.  He&#39;s just just a regular guy who lost his regular life like will happen to everyone else.  The implications of the event that took place show clear evidence of an agenda to give TSA agents more authority and arm them - agents who shouldn&#39;t be there in the first place, agents who were put in place after a domestic plan to increase security and limit freedoms of individuals based on fear.  He is one death in an order of hundreds of thousands of deaths a day: police officers, military, civilians.  They are playing up this event as hard as they can to drum up sympathy and support for an agenda.</p>

<p>If they really wanted to honor the man, they would have a candlelight vigil at night away from the airports - even if televised.  It would not be first thing in the morning at one of the busiest travel times on one of the busiest travel days of the week.  And yes, they ask passengers to bow their heads and honor the silence that they are imposing, and I guarantee you that those who are observed not respecting this moment of silence will be treated like trash by the TSA agents they must go through to get to their destination.</p>

<p>There may be such a conspiracy (agenda). There may not. The only thing we can know for sure is this guy was just doing his job when someone shot him. We can pretty accurately assume that even if there was an agenda/conspiracy, he probably did not volunteer to be shot to death or to participate in any way.</p>

<p>So we should just let anyone onto a plane carrying anything they want? Confused what you&#39;re trying to say here. I get that they probably shouldn&#39;t be feeling up grammas and little boys, but they should definitely be looking for weapons. <em>Someone</em> should be doing that, right?</p>

<p>He is the <strong>first</strong> on the job death of a TSA employee. That makes a difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yes, they ask passengers to bow their heads and honor the silence that they are imposing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe they will. I would do it. A man lost his life. A dad. A husband. A regular bloke got a bullet put in him just for doing his job that day.</p>

<p>If there is a conspiracy of some sort, it&#39;s not his fault. He&#39;s just a guy. He almost certainly wouldn&#39;t be &quot;in&quot; on it. He doesn&#39;t deserve ire. He doesn&#39;t deserve disrespect.</p>

<p>How many terrorist plots or tragedies have you heard of being stopped by the TSA?  How about the shoe/underwear bombers?  Were the agents who let these individuals through fired?  Do you honestly feel that if someone truly wanted to hijack an airplane, a minor search by the TSA would stop them?  Do you really need any oversight to what people carry on airplanes?  The only goal and only result of the TSA is to restrict and control the general population in their travel, to impose security and fear.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh?  So you&#39;re an authority on what constitutes being a special case and what is deserving of an honorable mention and what is not?  Shocking.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>On the same token, there is nothing about this individual that demands respect.  There is nothing special about this man.  He is just another man dieing on another day, as anyone else.  No, a man who loses his life in a conspiracy is very likely to not be in on the plot - but does that mean he deserves any special mention?  No.  The media pushes an agenda, and this event does nothing more than bolster this agenda and plant the idea that TSA officers have any sort of real importance or authority in the minds of the public. </p>

<p>Then maybe, instead of violating the privacy/rights/body of individuals simply wishing to travel, they should have trained individuals/guards to tag along on flights - less manpower and less expense than a full screening security force.  Oh wait, they already had something like that called federal air marshals.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re correct on this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings</a></p>

<p>There have been quite a few hijackings.  However, I fail to see how any of these justify the TSA or how the majority of them could have been stopped by the TSA.</p>

<p>Man gets onto plane unscreened. He&#39;s carrying a bomb. 35 minutes into the flight he reaches into his pocket and flips the detonator switch.</p>

<p>What does the air marshall do? Answer: dies with the rest of the passengers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s really fucking effective.</p>

<p>Serious question. You really want to rid US airports of all screening before boarding? Really? What is your answer to keeping homocidal fucktards off the flights? Or is the answer, gee, sorry that plane-ful of people died but at least nobody got searched?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to post several times in response to this and the conversation in general but it seems to be blocking me from doing so. Here goes again...</p>

<p>I think the matter should be left up to private security forces. I don&#39;t see why we need to keep pouring billions of our own tax dollars into this mess when the market could very well handle.</p>

<p>I would be interested to know your defense for the inconsistency of the TSA&#39;s efforts, another common complaint. If the purpose of the agency is to protect travelers, why aren&#39;t they patrolling bus stops and train stations? Is it perhaps because doing so would be silly, just as doing so at airports is mostly silly?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not opposed to that. As long as someone competent is screening for weapons, bombs, whatever persons of ill intent might try to bring onto a plane. I don&#39;t much care who it is, as long as it is done effectively.</p>

<p>As to the tax-funding, one way or the other, the cost will be paid by &quot;everyman&quot;. If not through taxes then through increased prices for air travel. But whatever.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m the person to &quot;defend&quot; anything.</p>

<p>From what I have seen, the TSA&#39;s efforts have been consistent - as far as I am aware there have been no incidents of violence in the air in any plane for which the TSA has screened all passengers. That&#39;s pretty consistent, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Or is it to protect <em>air</em> travelers? That does seem to be the agency&#39;s focus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why aren&#39;t they patrolling bus stops and train stations</p>

<p>Guessing because nobody has told them they should. Probably because violence in the air was more common and is more devastating than those others, but that&#39;s just a guess.</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has asked anyone in authority with or over the TSA those questions. Their answers would be interesting.</p>

<p>Or, you know, just fucking deal with it like everyone else has to.  Mass tragedies/tragedies in general happen every day.  They happen everywhere.  As is already shown every day in the media, having security measures such as the TSA in place doesn&#39;t solve a damn thing.

People need to take care of and defend themselves.  We need to start by educating the world, rather than painting individuals as crazy or terrorist for lashing back against a government or population that has betrayed and condemned them.

<p>Irrelevant, data would need to be presented that they had actively stopped these incidents from happening to prove any effectiveness.  The fact that they aren&#39;t occurring proves simply that they aren&#39;t being attempted( because by having the TSA in place, the objective of these initial events was reached ).</p>

<p>Damn shame, you know, because there have been so many airplane bombings.  What&#39;s this guy doing with a bomb anyway?  What&#39;s his motivation?  &quot;I&#39;m gonna blow up this plane for absolutely no reason dammit,&quot; because you hear about these random acts of plane violence so much.</p>

<p>How often do you hear about people wanting to blow up planes or read a manifesto about blowing up planes?  All of the &quot;crazy&quot; I&#39;ve seen has been in direct retaliation for the way the individual has been treated.</p>
