<p>The media has been trying to get that video of him smoking crack for several months, and one of the papers, I believe the Sun was able to obtain it.</p>

<p>Rob Ford has been a joke for a long time (from his campaign to election), people outside of Toronto generally have a very low opinion of Toronto, and people from there, and them electing Rob Ford just furthers the point of view that citizens of Ontario have of Toronto and it&#39;s citizens.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t any talk of the murder in the US. The scandal here is all about the smoking of the crack and his denial of it, followed by his admittance, followed by his rant, followed by his pussy eating remarks.

<p>the extortion case is why the guy admitted to crack use.  the police said they had evidence of it on a video related to the investigation - that belonged to the murdered guy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so they made a plea just to be sure of convicting him?  either he gave up his superiors, or the police and judicial system are covering it up.    I tend to think both.  </p>

<p>we&#39;ll see what happens in the Lisi case.  Here&#39;s what makes most sense.  </p>

<p>The cops plea out the executioner and get dirt on Lisi.   They get the video and arrest Lisi after surveillance.  Lisi refuses to rat out anyone, gets convicted of extortion.  Out in &lt;3.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The plea deal would have to come from the Crown, I don&#39;t believe the police have the authority to offer any sort of plea deal to Hashimi.</p>

<p>Normally, when there&#39;s going to be a plea deal, the defense and the Crown submit a joint plea deal, with a recommendation for sentencing, Crown on the high end, defense on the low end and the judge chooses something in the middle.</p>

<p>So, it does make perfect sense for the Crown to ask Hashimi, or for the defense to ask Hashimi to give up the info for a better conviction.</p>

<p>Whether or not this happened, we will probably never know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Doug Ford probably sells drugs to half of the Toronto police force that use them.</p>

<p>I had a former friend in the city I live in, who&#39;s father was a detective on the police force, she came home one day, opened the garage door, and there was her dad, and a bunch of his fellow detectives standing in a circle smoking a joint.  She just closed the garage door, walked into the house, and never said a word of it to her father, nor did he ever say anything to her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are wrong about the Ford election furthering the anti-Toronto point of view. If anything, Ford has been a relief from the smug superior attitude many Torontonians seem to have. Also, it is about the cracks smoking and otherwise lewd behavior. The elites and the media have had it in for Ford for a very long time. Ford is not being investigated for the Lisa murder. There is a lot of dirt on Ford that is being released, but it&#39;s drugs and alcohol, not murder. So, the point made by OP is legitimate.  People are carrying on about Ford using cracked, while ignoring far more heinous crimes -- drones, Benghazi murders, other murders?  Ford is a saint by comparison.</p>

<p>Protesters gather in Pretoria and Cape Town to demonstrate against US President Barack Obama&#39;s visit to South Africa. Protesters burned a flag outside the US embassy and decried Obama&#39;s bias to Israel and drone strike policies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what we&#39;re actually seeing is simply Obama being the first president to use drones so prolifically. Other presidents are surely soon to follow, as you can read between the lines in this article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Until last year, South African defence companies produced and exported only unarmed UAVs. This has changed with Denel Dynamics’s development of the Seeker 400, which is equipped with air-to-ground missiles. This armed drone has received international media interest, as there have been unconfirmed reports that the government approved the export of an unknown number of Seeker 400s to Saudi Arabia after the US declined to sell a consignment of its Predator drones to the Saudi government.</p>

<p>I personally feel warmongers whom lean right fit your description in a personal generic assumption guesstimate.

<p>I feel you do not subscribe to what you wrote &amp; thus feel you are not part of the &quot;we&quot; in &quot;we the people&quot; [if you live in the U.S.].

    <div class="md"><p>The Rob Ford thing is a result of a bunch of things... I think my summary from a couple weeks ago in<a href="/r/metacanada">/r/metacanada</a> is pretty accurate.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The city of Toronto used to be &#39;city center/downtown&#39;... then all the buroughs amalgamated... so essentially The city of Toronto downtown now included what people considered the burbs. This happened in 1998.</p>

<p>It was supposed to save a bunch of money... didn&#39;t really do anything beyond making the city center people pissed that they aren&#39;t getting more money for public transit when the city is spending money in the burbs and/or vice versa. So, downtowners and burbs are at odds with each other.</p>

<p>Anyways, election time for mayor happens in 2010 and Rob Ford campaigned on &#39;stopping the gravy train&#39;. After all the promises to reduce costs by the amalgamation, nothing happened... so cost cutting Ford is the answer to everyone&#39;s woes. everyone outside of the downtown core pretty much ate it up. It was kinda funny, being he kept on message and didn&#39;t seem to shoot himself that much in the foot. Saying that, the left wing press hated him for running... seemed like every day or two they&#39;d do gotcha type things where they were clearly being bullies to the bully. This was lead by The Toronto Star (newspaper) who had previously reported very questionable things (which turned out to be false) about conservative candidates in previous elections. Ford ended up winning the election in 2010 for mayor. He not only won, but won convincingly getting 47% of votes.</p>

<p>So, Ford vs Star was on like donkey kong.</p>

<p>So, epic battle begins... The Toronto Star and the circlejerking liberal youth (ie reddit demographic) vs enemy #1 Rob Ford. Seemed like every week or two there is another gotcha on Ford. I mean, one week he is beating up kids on a football team he coached... the next he drove drunk in florida a decade ago... he gets caught reading a paper while driving. It was exhausting. It blurred the lines of his actual gaffs like when he decided to not go to the pride parade (lgbt parade) etc. During this time, depending on the sideshow... he got some national coverage. It was amusing on many levels.</p>

<p>Then the WOW moment. Rob Ford caught smoking crack on video! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? For the left wingers, this was winning the lotto with the right wingers crying foul. Being the Toronto Star is not really credible for right wingers, saying 2 of their reporters saw a UFO but had no evidence makes every right winger say it&#39;s another scam... while everyone on the left says they are upstanding journalists so it must be true 100% positive.</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s it in a nutshell... it&#39;s the left wingers all excited that the UFO turns out to be real and are screaming, &quot;I told you so!... I knew it all along!&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saying &quot;I told you so&quot; is so fulfilling... and then Ford not stepping down... and a bunch of shit since.  Anyways, the leftards who are spamming reddit with Rob Ford circlejerks are idiots... It&#39;s somewhat entertaining in a way that their passion to remove the buffoon from office takes away from attention to obviously more important issues.  </p>

NO ONE I have ever met in real life -- including the most anti-muslim, pro 2nd-amendment, Hell-Yeah-America cowboys --  buys the line that killing Pakistani goat herders with drone strikes is protecting us in any way.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The plea deal would have to come from the Crown, I don&#39;t believe the police have the authority to offer any sort of plea deal to Hashimi.</p>

<p>Normally, when there&#39;s going to be a plea deal, the defense and the Crown submit a joint plea deal, with a recommendation for sentencing, Crown on the high end, defense on the low end and the judge chooses something in the middle.</p>

<p>So, it does make perfect sense for the Crown to ask Hashimi, or for the defense to ask Hashimi to give up the info for a better conviction.</p>

<p>Whether or not this happened, we will probably never know.</p>

<p>Besides, there&#39;s enough history of corruption in the police force that is common knowledge.  Also, many in the judicial system have been implied threats relating to their own drug use and other &#39;skeletons&#39;  </p>
