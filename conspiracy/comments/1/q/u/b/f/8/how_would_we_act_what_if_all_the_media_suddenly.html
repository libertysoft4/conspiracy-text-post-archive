    <div class="md"><p>I have watched a few conspiracy videos, not only of JFK but 9/11. </p>

<p>It is incredibly sad to watch some of the men break down and tear up with the admission they have had to accept that their own government is hiding the facts. </p>

<p>Imagine that from the nation.  </p>

<p>I wonder how much blame would be placed on the news organizations, elected officials, university history departments, etc.

    <div class="md"><p>The point is, this is like time travel basically. When they write the official narrative, it&#39;s how the public takes in history. If they finally reveal that things didn&#39;t happen the way they said the first time, then that unravels the entire time line. What deeds have been done for the interest of the elite, yet re-branded as acts of terror, as wars of democracy? What other public figures have been silenced for their views? It opens up an entire new can of issues and distrust. For many americans that might be the last straw. Many americans that might be the eye opener that brings them to our level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but you wanted an opinion of what would happen about it; and since most would have a hard time correlating this event to our modern day lives, most wouldn&#39;t do a damn thing. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s not something that is blatantly fucking each of us in the ass on a daily basis; (even though that&#39;s how I see it) people will be completely nonchalant about it. The vast majority will only interpret the main message and will move on.</p>

<p>&quot;So rick, did you hear that the government was responsible for the JFK assassination?! Yea John, that is some crazy shit, now lets finish this shift and go have some cold ones.&quot;</p>

<p>Like I said dude, it is a very sad thing to witness, but people are diluted as fuck. They have bills to pay and sports to watch, they feel competent because that is how it was designed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s going to take something a lot more shocking to wake up the sleeping giant. Sometimes you have to stop trying to imagine your personality being similar to others, expecting everyone to be as mad and surprised about something just like you were about it. </p>

<p>If the modern day NSA leaks and information isn&#39;t going to start change, neither will something that happened in 1963.</p>

<p>Welcome to your brave new world.</p>

<p>Imbecility is just one of your many enemies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like time travel. You change the truth about one incident in history and it unravels the entire fabric of the time line. It destroys the remaining trust and confidence the government has from the people. Think about some of the names of politicians and lobbyists and other revolving door members that have been in the game since jfk days. They could very well have been implicit in the assassination. What other public figures have been silenced by the government? What other points of history are completely wrong?</p>
