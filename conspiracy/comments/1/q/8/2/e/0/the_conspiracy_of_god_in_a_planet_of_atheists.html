        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>God doesn&#39;t get involved.</p>

<p>I genuinely believe in God. The God that I believe in is Allah. That&#39;s how he reached out to me. If you believe in YHWH then you are my brother. As are you, if Jehovah reached out to you. In fact I believe you are all my brothers. We are in this infinitely lonely universe, as one person I&#39;m nothing, but there are 6,335,000,000.</p>

<p>I believe mankind has existed for hundreds of millions of years; testaments to this are all around us from the impossible construction of the great monoliths such as the Pyramids of Giza to the Seeds of Life that are planted all around us. 
I believe God has been sending messages to us since the beginning of time. God says that we are all equal, they say that we are not. God forbids the application of interest because because it brings unjust gains through exploitation. 
They tell us... well... we exist in debt weather we have money or not. Jesus chased the money changers out, we let them give us a choice in one of two candidates who pretend to rule over us.</p>

<p>God says believe in the creator. They say God said do this, don&#39;t do that, give us money, you can&#39;t smoke that. God says believe GodThey say only your God is the true God. </p>

<p>God says remember me. They say I am your God, this book is your proof. This is your God.</p>

<p>We are a family of 6,335,000,000 they are no more than 165,000,000. </p>

<p>We are all companions of paradise. We are already in paradise; we just don&#39;t know it.</p>

<p>Edit: Comments make for interesting reading; </p>

<p>165,000,000 is my approximation of 1% of this worlds population. </p>

<p>I bow down and worship, fuck money and all the other bullshit filth created by men to trick other men into worshiping them and their idols and money.</p>

<p>I only &quot;need&quot; money because I can&#39;t claim a plot of land that allows me to build a home on and grow my own food on. I wish I could do that and be surrounded by other people that also do that.</p>

<p>People that all know how to live off the land and actively work for each others benefits.</p>

<p>But no.</p>

<p>The government makes this IMPOSSIBLE because they claim all the land and then charge you to merely exist. You HAVE to use their money system or you&#39;ll be thrown in jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I believe in the God of the bible is that he is said to be perfect.</p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s logical that the only way in which our existence has come to be is through the love of a perfect creator that has power and dominion over all.</p>

<p>The only way you can comprehend existence is to exist.</p>

<p>This kind of creates what you may call a &quot;logic loop&quot; in existence, because somehow it exists, despite what I or you or any other single piece of energy that exists has to do, say, or think.</p>

<p>For some reason, everything exists, and it apparently all came from nothing.</p>

<p>How did nothing exist as nothing and then have the power to turn into existence and give that existence to every other existence to come after it&#39;s inception however many hundreds of trillions of years ago it&#39;s claimed to be?</p>

<p>How can any of us mere mortals wrap our heads around the concept of a beginning without a beginning or an end without an end?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making the assumption that the default state of reality is nothing though. </p>

<p>When really, the opposite seems to be true. There is no &quot;nothing&quot;, anywhere in reality, just different configurations of <strong>something</strong>. Even zero in mathematics is treated as [undefined], rather than literal nothing.</p>

<p>We can understand and use the word &quot;nothing&quot; as an abstract - but when we&#39;re saying it, what we really mean is &quot;not this thing&quot;.  </p>

<p>Atheists say there was a causeless cause (big bang?), the religious say god is a causeless cause. Neither of these theories really work without infinitely regressing down the chain of cause and effect, or imagining a being separate from reality that somehow interacts with reality, nor do these theories adequately describe reality today as we experience it. </p>

<p>Energy cannot be destroyed, and the Net total energy in the universe is theorized to be zero. We are made up of that energy, which at its base level is physically nothing, just a kind of formless &quot;probability&quot; information. </p>

<p>Modern quantum psychics seems to suggest time itself is an illusion, therefore attempting to understand these questions by applying causational logic seems pointless to me. </p>

<p>This leads me to believe the universe and reality is some kind of eternal infinite. You may as well call it a loop, or in other words, it had no beginning, and has no end, and everything is an illusion :) </p>

<p>How can I convince anybody of anything though?</p>

<p>You can believe you die and it doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;ll keep existing through the power of your own conscientiousness.</p>

<p>You can believe you die and it does matter, and that you&#39;ll either exist in a good afterlife or bad after life.</p>

<p>You can believe the moon is an artificial satellite controlled by space lizards that control us through frequency emitters.</p>

<p>You can believe this universe is a hologram.</p>

<p>You can believe your entire existence isn&#39;t even real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, we must first agree how to define &quot;God&quot; before we can figure out if it exists, since everyone has their own unique idea of what &quot;God&quot; is. </p>

<p>The God I believe in may as well be called the universe, or fundamental reality. It is not a conscious being outside of reality, but the entirety of reality itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno about enlightening. But it was a sweet sentiment. I personally cannot ascribe to any particular earthly god. I think God is just a blanket term for the forces of the universe that we have yet to understand. However that is not to say that we cannot be spiritual. I think religions and gods with a name just complicate and compartmentalize the connection we naturally share with one another and the universe as a whole.. I believe we are born of it, and it is as much a part of us as we are of it.</p>

<p>I dont understand people who  anthropomorphize it, label it, and then bicker amongst one another about what it all means. I think it simply is, and it doesnt need to be any more complicated than that.  I dunno if you&#39;ve seen <a href="http://wayseermanifesto.com/wayseer-manifesto-lyrics.html">this</a> before, but I think it pretty much sums up what Im trying to say in a round about way. </p>

<p>I just want you to know that I do appreciate those of an organized religion having such a similar viewpoint as someone like me who would prefer the organization see its way out, so I give your post an upvote.  My biggest hope is that more and more of your abrahamic brothers can come to this conclusion as well. We are all expressions the divine order, there is nothing dividing us, but foolish imaginary games.. and perhaps a few ancient wounds that we must come together to heal. namaste!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I suppose you could say that. But I also suppose that must depend on your definition of god. I think one of the main parts of organized religion is the concept of faith.  If science is just understanding the mind of god, then that would imply that god can be understood, and wouldnt that make faith unnecessary? Thus wouldnt god cease to be god, but a set of principals and laws that govern the cosmos? - science?  If god no longer works in mysterious ways is he still god? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im ok with different ideas of god, if it does allow unity. but most simply dont. I see the goodness in organized religion, but I also see the pointless deception, and the ulterior motives a lot of them employ. Hinduism is a good yet poor example, some sects of hinduism require a wife to throw themselves on a funeral pyre. Organized religion is a form of mind control. it creates differences that dont exist outside a mindset. hinduism almost gets it right, but it still has its prejudices. namaste, means you in me and me in you, at its core, and thats why I brought eastern philosophy into it. I think all concepts of what god is fall short, and thats why a vast majority of us miss the point. God is our greater power... our connection, our unexplainable, our common ground.  I love your link, always have loved that speach... its a big part of what I am trying to say and what I feel. We are all a part of this. I love you whatever god you align with... but, I would hope that we as a whole see past naming that feeling with a humanized god and see it as a human trait instead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy&#39;s name is cunt breath. I mean... what?</p>

<p>And if God doesn&#39;t get involved, then what is Jesus all about? </p>

<p>It seems that &quot;cunt breath&quot; is Muslim. Muslims believe in Jesus, and that he was sent from God, and will be sent down at the end of time to save us. This is interesting to me, for the simple reason that it is not as well known as it should be.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve found in my research is that almost all the survivors of SRA say that the only thing that saved them is Jesus. Of course, it is incredibly unfashionable to believe in Jesus these days... and back in Roman times they threw Christians to the lions for sport... but then the Romans figured out that they could control Christianity and that was that. </p>

<p>My personal belief is that Jesus is very real. And as a former atheist, I am constantly surprised that I have come to the conclusion that Jesus is, in a literal sense, our Saviour. You don&#39;t even have to truly believe - just say his name when you need help. </p>

<p>We are in the middle of a spiritual war that is way beyond our understanding (I&#39;ve done a lot of research, but I&#39;m still in the dark). We can&#39;t win alone. We need Jesus. I&#39;m not talking about religion here - I&#39;m talking about you (or me) as an individual, just accepting this possibility.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convert anyone - but please remember what I&#39;m saying here... Hopefully it will make some sense to you one day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you open your remarks by commenting on the moniker that cunt_breath chose for his account?</p>

<p>It caused me to pause on your moniker, tommytime69. This name you chose could be stretched with any manner of sexual connotations...</p>

<p>Saul became <sup>Paul</sup> for personal, spiritual reasons. Perhaps that would be a good self study for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to judge you but hopefully this will prevent you from being foolishly preachy in the future. </p>

<p>The whole Jesus thing will really suck for you if you think Jesus will turn away from one of His sheep, simply because <em>you&#39;re</em> offended by cunt_breaths name...</p>

<p>Hope this gives you something to contemplate in your journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;God doesn&#39;t get involved.&quot;</p>

<p>That is very interesting to contemplate when we contend with the Christian-Judeo-Quran &quot;scriptures and doctrines&quot; passed down through the generations, verbally and then, as physical documents.</p>

<p>These &quot;religious texts&quot; all talk about war, death, struggles, power and your perception intrigues me! Does your religious belief not include an amazing return of some powerful entity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey you guys, I see that people who believe things and consider them fact, like to argue  with people who believe things and consider them fact..  </p>

<p>What you guys do in fighting and degrading each other&#39;s beliefs (atheism/theism, nether having a remote possiblity of being proven or disproven scientifically), provides nothing more than comedic value for inner circle conversations about how stupid the other is, later. and neither side has grown.  Fundimentalism holds strong on both sides, and that&#39;s the area to get past. How about we simply live and let live, when no one is doing violence to the other, and try to be the best, most open minded whateverweare that we can be. </p>

<p>Unless, of course you want to create a world that has a victor and a loser, then by all means, argue, create disdain, create a movement based on misunderstandings, and go out and kill all those people who are stupid and holding humanity back because their opinions are different.</p>

<p>you&#39;re both fighting for the same thing, take that how you want.

    <div class="md"><p>It seems whenever religion is discussed all my mind lets me hear is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Like the adults from Peanuts cartoons.  It baffles me the level of denial that all religious folk live their life with,.  &quot;My life CAN&#39;T be pointless!  My existence HAS TO STAND FOR SOMETHING! THERE&#39;S GOT TO BE MORE!&quot;  Piss off.  Religious people to me are the most simple minded douchebags in existence.  Who the hell needs some fairy tale deity to direct them to be a decent human being when natural law and COMMON SENSE tells us it&#39;s the right thing to do.  I do not believe in any god, yet I treat other people with respect and human decency because that&#39;s the way people should live their damned lives.  Regardless of the context of the OP, I just hate religious crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making the assumption that the default state of reality is nothing though. </p>

<p>When really, the opposite seems to be true. There is no &quot;nothing&quot;, anywhere in reality, just different configurations of <strong>something</strong>. Even zero in mathematics is treated as [undefined], rather than literal nothing.</p>

<p>We can understand and use the word &quot;nothing&quot; as an abstract - but when we&#39;re saying it, what we really mean is &quot;not this thing&quot;.  </p>

<p>Atheists say there was a causeless cause (big bang?), the religious say god is a causeless cause. Neither of these theories really work without infinitely regressing down the chain of cause and effect, or imagining a being separate from reality that somehow interacts with reality, nor do these theories adequately describe reality today as we experience it. </p>

<p>Energy cannot be destroyed, and the Net total energy in the universe is theorized to be zero. We are made up of that energy, which at its base level is physically nothing, just a kind of formless &quot;probability&quot; information. </p>

<p>Modern quantum psychics seems to suggest time itself is an illusion, therefore attempting to understand these questions by applying causational logic seems pointless to me. </p>

<p>This leads me to believe the universe and reality is some kind of eternal infinite. You may as well call it a loop, or in other words, it had no beginning, and has no end, and everything is an illusion :) </p>
