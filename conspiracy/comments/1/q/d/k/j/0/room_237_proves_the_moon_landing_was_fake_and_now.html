<p>It <em>could</em> have been, sure. But there&#39;s a lot more to overcome than that tiny bit of speculation to lend any credibility to the &quot;we didn&#39;t land men on the moon&quot; conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest logical hurdle is that the USSR and the USA were in a race to do it, we were shooting at each other in Viet Nam at the time so we were clearly enemies, and the USSR never once even hinted that we didn&#39;t do exactly what we said we did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to convince you--only putting theories out there.</p>

<p>For me it comes down to this--tell me how man was sent through the Van Allen belts with &quot;shielding&quot; the thickness of two sheets of tinfoil.</p>

<p>Tell me how this &quot;spacecraft&quot; with such thin skin could be filled with 1 atmosphere of &quot;air&quot; without blowing up?</p>

<p>It was the 1960s. EVERYTHING had to be run with batteries. Where did they go?? Ever see the inside of the lunar lander? It&#39;s smaller than the front of a Cessna 152. Now tell me...where do the batteries (LOTS of them) air tanks, fuel tanks, helium tanks, CO2 scrubbers, computers (remember--they were big), AC/heating equipment, ENGINE, engine controls, avionics, electronics to run the avionics. stellar transit, cameras, spacesuits, food, water, experiment instruments, cameras, film, radios, radio electronics, A FULL-SIZE LUNAR ROVER, not to mention (hehe) LOTS of &quot;moon rocks&quot; for the trip back (I&#39;ll stop there though the list is nowhere near complete)...where did it all fit?</p>

<p>Did they have a roof rack on that puppy? </p>

<p>I WANT to believe, trust me, I SO want to believe this country was that great, once upon a time. But here&#39;s the facts: the Sovs were whipping our ASSES in every aspect of space travel. EVERY ONE. They concluded that putting a man on the moon wasn&#39;t possible. They publicly said that they could beat America no problem if the cosmonauts were to give their lives to travel through the Van Allen belts as the dose of radiation going through ONE WAY would kill them in weeks, if not sooner.</p>

<p>So why no exposure from the Russkies? Your guess is as good as mine. My guess is that we had something BIG to blackmail them with...though what that could have been is beyond my ability to even wager a guess. All of this is just conjecture anyhow.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t loiter in the Van Allen belts. They traveled through them at a fairly high rate of speed. Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">this article</a> for information about how little radiation humans might receive doing that. I&#39;ll summarize:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the astronauts&#39; overall exposure was dominated by solar particles once outside the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.</p>

<p>Tell me how this &quot;spacecraft&quot; with such thin skin could be filled with 1 atmosphere of &quot;air&quot; without blowing up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do planes do it, made of the same stuff, at 37,000 feet? What happens if, say a window blows out of a plane at that altitude - explosive decompression.</p>

<p>Learn some science. Do some reading. The answers to all your questions are pretty simple and out there.</p>

<p>Firing shots at each other could have quickly escalated into nuclear annihilation. We are fortunate that each side showed the restraint it did. At one point, that restraint fell squarely onto the shoulders of exactly one man, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov">Stanislav Petrov</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I do not have a strong opinion, just have doubts.  So there&#39;s that caveat . . . . </p>

<p>Second, the evidence is sketchy in some regards.  Many of the test videos from the U.S. government look doctored, as some in that thread point out.</p>

<p>Then we have the issue of Japan.  Some of the damage is consistent with firebombing rather than nuclear bombs.  The damage to cities leveled by conventional bombs looks identical to the alleged nuclear devastation.  The U.S. and allies perfected the art of firebombing cities during WWII and could create huge hurricanes of fire.  </p>

<p>The motive is certainly there as well.  If the Soviet Union and the U.S. were thought to be the only countries possessing the power of God for a few decades this benefits them both quite nicely . . . and dovetails into the other conspiracy theories that the same people actually ran both countries and they both agreed to promote the hoaxes of a cold war, the nuclear bomb, and the moon landing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the way the theory goes:</p>

<p>We&#39;ve sent men to low earth orbit.  The technological difficulties of sending men through the Van Allen belt and into outer space, with the concomitant massive doses of radiation, render it incredibly difficult--as scientists at the time JFK made the pledge to go to the moon recognized.  The amount of lead or other material required to protect the astronauts required massive amounts of power to get them there and back.  Plus, the spacesuits the astronauts allegedly wore don&#39;t look like they could have credibly protected astronauts from the elements.  And the ability of the lander to land on the moon and have it take off again, not to mention dock back with the space ship in orbit, seems unlikely.  The ability to send video back in real time seems dubious as well.</p>

<p>The images of the landing were likely faked by creating scenes on Earth, directed by Stanley Kubrick, and mixed with real footage of astronauts in low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>The burden should be on those claiming these suits back then could do all this because the claims are so extraordinary.</p>

<p>Plus, NASA can&#39;t even make suits like this today and is asking for help, and studying how humans can make it past the Van Allen belts.</p>

<p>As a comment from the above notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the whole air-conditioning question is another huge problem. regardless of how much computing power they had, nothing can explain how thr suits and craft kept them from being cooked alive, operating on what were basically just car batteries (for 3 days in 200-300 degree heat), especially when there is no atmosphere, no outside air to use to cool the inside air. (We all understand how modern a/c works right?) It’s a joke if u stop and think about it for even five minutes! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Much lower gravity on the moon makes it much easier to get off of it than to get off of Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, who was operating the camera that was able to pan up and follow the take off?  Second, there are not any real thrusters to get the craft off the moon.  Third, it&#39;s a huge technological feat to time the launch so that it can rendezvous with the space ship about 100 miles away orbiting the moon at a crazy fast speed.</p>

<p>This video explores the unlikely aspects of the lunar landing and take off.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the delay I have a problem with . . . it&#39;s the ability of them to film it and send video back to Earth in the first place.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it just as challenging a feat to time launches so they can rendez-vous with the ISS? Speed is relative. The ISS orbits at a crazy-fast speed in relation to the ground, but in relation to something that&#39;s trying to synchronize its orbit with it, it&#39;s not nearly so fast.</p>

<p>What&#39;s so hard about that? We had the ability to broadcast via radio waves long before the late &#39;60&#39;s.</p>

<p>OK, time to review videos. This one&#39;s a good one if the video actually shows that.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> On Apollos 11, 12, and 14, on which no rovers were taken to the Moon, there were no pictures taken of the lunar surface ascent.</p>

<p>From science.com:</p>

<p>When sunlight hits the moon&#39;s surface, the temperature can reach 253 degrees F (123 C).</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fire proximity suits first appeared during the 1930s</p>

<p>Approach suit... (Ambient heat protection up to ~200 °F (93 °C).)</p>

<p>Proximity suit... proximity ambient protection~ 500 °F</p>

<p>Entry suit ambient protection ~2,000 °F for short duration and prolonged radiant heat up to 1,500 °F</p>

<p>Seems like we could have done the heat resistance in the &#39;60&#39;s. Bigger question is radiation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, there are not any real thrusters to get the craft off the moon.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t take much. The moon&#39;s gravity is about 16.7% that on Earth&#39;s surface. I would weigh a whopping 37lbs on the moon - about what I need to lose here on Earth.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ascent stage of the lunar module weighed 10,024 lbs on Earth or 1,674 lbs on the moon.
It had thrusters offering 3,500 lbf (16,000 N) of thrust</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that enough to get it off the moon? Dunno. Need a rocket scientist to chime in with the right formula.</p>

<p>Okay, sure, in addition to designing heating/cooling systems for spacesuits that could run on the equivalent of a car battery for days, as well as block radiation, NASA spent its time making sure it could remote control zoom out and pan its video to capture the ascent from the moon.  Why create this needless extra difficulty?  </p>

<p>Here by the way is a description in Time about the technology they allegedly used to do this, and Captain Video, Ed Fendell, the man who allegedly operated the camera from Houston:</p>

<p>Why do you need a heating/cooling system? Why not make it work like a thermos? Thermoses do not need any external energy source. They simply slow down the impact of the external environment on whatever is inside them. Soup or coffee? Warm until lunch! Milk or juice? Cold until lunch! All in the same container I paid $3 for! :)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, because it&#39;s really cool to have video of the blast-off from the moon, and we didn&#39;t have that for many of the missions. I&#39;m sure this wasn&#39;t a thousands of man hours thing.</p>

<p>The Google one seems to indicate a human was operating the camera via remote-control for Apollo 15 (different video than the one I watched). Seems plausible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Apollo 17 was the same - human operated - but that also seems plausible. Notice how the camera abruptly pans upward as the module starts to leave the frame. There&#39;s just over 2 seconds of delay communicating moon-earth-moon. That&#39;s about the delay from the initial blast until the camera starts panning up.</p>

<p>Again, the zoom out which is another of the remote controlled functions, happens right when the blast does.  So perfect timing there.</p>

<p>I acknowledge it&#39;s possible to operate a camera on a time delay and that it would be easier with a count down and after two other attempts.  Although, who is conducting the countdown?  Houston?  How did the astronauts sync the blast off with the countdown, did they push the button when the countdown was at 2?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about this video technology--I&#39;m just dubious of these claims because I think all the evidence, in toto, makes it unlikely we actually landed on the moon, and then when I hear of some complicated measures and new technology to beam live footage back to earth, I&#39;m suspicious.  I would just think they wouldn&#39;t add yet another huge scientific feat onto the already difficult tasks they had.  </p>

<p>If it was Houston then let&#39;s assume Houston said &quot;ignition&quot; and the operator started the pan as soon as he heard it. A bit over a second later, the word rang in the astronaut&#39;s ears and the camera received the order to zoom out. The astronaut hit the switch or whatever they did and the camera zoomed.  Synchronized. Like a ballet. ;-)</p>

<p>What&#39;s complicated about broadcasting radio waves? We had TV for how many years before 1969? Answer: well over 15 years of regular-guy, in-home use.</p>

<p>To get a good feel for how technology can advance in that timeline, 15 years ago, the Nokia brick cell phone was cutting edge. The iconic Motorola RAZR flip-phone (still a &quot;dumb&quot; phone) wouldn&#39;t come out for another 5 years. Today the phone at my waist is many times more powerful than the best desktop computer I could find 15 years ago.</p>

<p>And I disagree with your assessment about how awesome cell phones are . . . we are still using the basic technology that&#39;s been around for about 100 years.

<p>What I imagine to be complicated about beaming the footage back from the moon is the camera involved, the broadcasting ability to beam it back to earth, and the distance involved, and the ability to get a good signal on earth.  Did the camera have trouble operating in 200 degree plus or minus temps?  How were these broadcast?  What was the power source?</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t have to beam it directly back to Earth. It could have beamed it to the orbiter which relayed it back to Earth.</p>

<p>Battery or solar; it doesn&#39;t take much to get a signal from the lunar surface to an orbiter.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the power source for the Sirius/XM satellite? That beams many times the data through a much denser atmosphere than that camera would have had to. What&#39;s the power source on your cell phone? It transmits a signal to towers miles away, again through atmosphere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the camera or filming the liftoff is a problem.</p>

<p>Still need to look up the radiation protection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One, I don&#39;t accept that the USSR and the USA were truly opposed to one another.  As mentioned below there is some indication the people controlling both countries were one in the same . . . for instance, Germany and other Axis powers during WWII made this argument.  Look at who benefited after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Look at who funded the Bolshevics.  The U.S. and USSR fought together in WWII.  There is good evidence the U.S. intelligence agencies shared information and ties with the USSR.</p>

<p>Second, even if they were truly opposed, there are reasons to keep quiet.  They might not be believed and don&#39;t want to get into a fight with the U.S. they know they would lose.  Maybe this hoax benefited Russia as well as it justified military investment and other things Russia was doing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is my assertion as well. Room 237 was used in parallel with the actual mission. It is so for many reasons. A precaution against the prospect of broadcasting the death of american astronauts Live of television as well as a shield against accidentally exposing top secret stuff for the whole world to see. You know, that kind of things. </p>

<p>Consider the political climate of the time. The flat out manic attitude towards everything Russian by the Americans and you can easily conceive such a ploy as <em>likely</em> and <em>sensible</em>. Furthermore, it&#39;s corroborated by the fact the television broadcasters were not allowed to access the LIVE feed of the spaceship. Their only option was to relay whatever picture NASA fed them. TV people did complain of the shit quality of the picture. One would think they&#39;d bring along a better kodak than some crap from 1934 or something. Joke is, they did! Not the tv signal, tho. Oh no. Can&#39;t have that. Shit pictures facilitate the concealment of imperfections... Them Russians could spy on our precious bodily fluids! Sneaky ruskies! etc.</p>

<p>... and there you have it. It&#39;s interesting I reached that conclusion largely by myself. This is my smug face :D. I had never even heard of Room 237 before today. It&#39;s funny because I thought I had seen all there is to see about the whole moon landing hoax affair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is the only theory involving a moon mission hoax that I can see being viable.  In fact, I would be stunned if we <em>didn&#39;t</em> film some footage to use as actual moon landing footage just as a safety net in case things went wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember hearing something very similar where the excuse was that they were worried that a live feed would not work, so it was  pre-recorded and then played back as &#39;live&#39; footage later. By that i mean, they DID land on the moon, record their footage, left, then sent to back to be played as &#39;live&#39; footage of the moon-landing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree the theory presents some good info and solid proof that it was at least possible to fake them - but I personally think they went and used real footage mixed with fakes made during training for national/factional security reasons. </p>

<p>It creates a paradox, for me, because I personally believe in projects like the TR3B. If I start believing it&#39;s impossible to go to the moon, I can&#39;t justify thinking supra-lux an super sonic flights are possible on Earth. </p>

<p>Has anyone else tried to square the possibilities of both existing at the same time? Fact of extremely fast and secret aircraft with the possibility of a faked landing?</p>
