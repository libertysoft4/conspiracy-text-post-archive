<p>Mustard greens etc.</p>

<p>A little bit of everything.</p>

<p>They learned pretty quickly to check the labels I have staked out near the pepper plants before eating them.  I grow some really hot peppers.  Habaneros and scorpions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still end up hauling grocery bags full of stuff to family on the weekends.  The neighbors really don&#39;t eat many veggies.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you my favorite garden recipe,</p>

<p>Pick out a nice plump zucchini, a foot long and consistently thick from end to end.</p>

<p>Cut that bad boy in half long ways so that you have two foot long halves.</p>

<p>Lay them on a cookie sheet with the flat side up, brush on a generous amount of olive oil and sprinkle on some garlic salt.  The olive oil will disappear into the zucchini, this is okay.  Slice some tomatoes thick and lay the slices on top of your zucchini halves, covering as much of the zucchini as possible.</p>

<p>Bake that shit at 350f until those tomatoes are a sizzling and a bubbling.</p>

<p>Take out of oven and sprinkle a little more garlic salt, maybe some cracked pepper and bury those tomatoes under a layer of parmesan cheese, the real stuff, not the powder in a bottle.</p>

<p>Return to oven until the cheese is slightly browned and then you&#39;re done.</p>

<p>This fucker will be hot and juicy inside so let it cool down before you punish your face with it.</p>

<p>If all steps are followed properly, you will experience the zucchini loaf of pure joy.</p>

<p>Edit: sometimes you have to slice a little off the back of your zucchini halves to keep them from rolling over, usually not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family and I have an 8 acre farm in Hawaii. We grow tons of coffee, macnuts, organic veggies, fruits and vegetable plants. We have had a booth at our farmers market for 3 years. We give away/barter or accept donation for all of it. We set up gardens for people in need and teach them to be self sufficient. If we have extra boar meat/fish we give it to our community etc. We know our neighbors very well and form local community in our immediate area and beyond. We host potlucks and exchange seeds, gardening tips, and plants. My family consists of muscians and they donate their time playing at community functions, funerals and veterans events. We pick up trash at the beach. We live a simple life and hope others can see in our lifestyle choices that simple is good. We teach our child to be humble, independent, self sufficient, creative, innovative, work hard, to respect his elders, learn his native language and perpetuate his culture of Aloha. </p>
