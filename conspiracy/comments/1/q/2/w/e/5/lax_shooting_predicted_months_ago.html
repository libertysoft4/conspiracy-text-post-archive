If I remember correctly it came from 4chan and said that the shooting would be used to put guns in the hands of TSA. Does anyone else remember this? I can&#39;t seem to find it but swear I read it here. </p>

<p>I seem to remember hearing a few of the first law enforcement officers on the scene at the Navy yard shooting were also interestingly enough, present in Boston.</p>

<p>It was based on a training group that was active in Boston on the day of the bombing because they had plans to be active in LA in early November.</p>

<p>I think you might be referring to <a href="http://www.urbanshield.org/index.php/2012-urban-shield-exercise/about-urban-shield">Urban Shield</a>. Urban Shield was planning a similar preparedness drill in Boston, either before or after the bombing (I&#39;m not sure). In California, it was Oct 25-Oct 28th, so 2 days after the drill ended the shooting happened. There is news footage of a police chief or somebody saying &quot;we just practiced this exact situation&quot; and the men behind him facepalm...I think this is what he is referring to but I can&#39;t seem to find this video now so if anyone has it, please share.</p>

That would be like prediciting rain in the coming week(s) in Seattle, of course it&#39;s going to happen. It&#39;s happened in the past and will happen in the future. This post was different, it predicted a shooting at a major us airport at the TSA checkpoints within a certain timeframe AND it actually came true! The problem with your logic is that I can&#39;t remember the last time, or any time for that matter that some shot up a TSA checkpoint. I&#39;m not claiming that this was a false flag, there isn&#39;t enough evidence. What I am saying is there was a prediction that was eerily accurate. </p>
