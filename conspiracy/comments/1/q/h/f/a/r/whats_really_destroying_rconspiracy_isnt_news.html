        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker in here for a long while, and I seen the quality of this subreddit slowly fade into ridiculous levels, hence why I call this problem a &quot;silent death&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the recent outrage against mods in reddit, people angry because of censorship here and there, but to be honest, there is another problem that afflicts the entrails of this subreddit, this evil that infiltrated under our noses and only a few seem to be outraged by it.</p>

<p>And that problem are those shady blog sites, spam survivalist sites, youtube video compilations where everything is edited in a way that makes it seem like Martial law will come tomorrow evening, or that there will be a revolution sometime next month etc.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like alternative news, but lets be honest, most are just bullshit full of fearmongering, alarmist fearporn which at the end of the day, rather than prove a point regarding conspiracist, it just reinforces the image of the conspiratard. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t even bother pointing them out, I am sure the real users in here will be able to discern them with ease.</p>

<p>Just because someone deems themselves as an alternative journalist, it doesn&#39;t make them legit, I&#39;m certain many go as far as making reddit accounts to promote their sites in here, and I&#39;M SURE many of you have noticed it and feel ticked off by it, There are a couple of people who do real journalistic jobs out there, but I&#39;m calling you all out to stop being so gullible, what makes a conspiracist is the suspicious and discriminating attitude towards information, what makes a conspiratard is a gullible mentality of anything seen on the internet. </p>

<p>Like Homer Simpson once said &quot;that guy wrote it all in caps in the internet, he must be right.&quot;</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m implying here is, we need all those junk sites and youtube clips compilation moved somewhere else, they don&#39;t belong in r/conspiracy, they just discredit you guys, they will be the silent death of this subreddit as it slowly loses credibility and becomes overwhelmed by such links.</p>

<p>when we less realize it, we&#39;ll have that clown of truther.org coming here posting in 3rd person claiming he&#39;s a bigger hero than snowden being denied asylum for nothing on Zurich for writing sci-fi while making alt accounts to agree with himself and defend his posts like he done in other conspiratard communities.</p>

<p>just some months ago we enjoyed some very wonderful self posts and great links provided by a user OWNtheNWO which I haven&#39;t seen in a while again.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hope this gets some attention as I wouldn&#39;t like this sub to become a joke.</p>

<p>Note: I rarely post in here (reddit), so my formatting probably sucks, sorry.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying Censorship isn&#39;t an issue, I&#39;m just saying losing credibility is a BIGGER issue.</p>

<p>We should stand united in the issue rather than divide and conquer, or wait? did I hit a spot in there?</p>

<p>And ignoring such posts is difficult, because rather than having one front page with the pulp of all info, we have 4 pages with tons of filler and very few reliable info.
Also, it&#39;s harder to keep track of the reliable and good info thus making it more succeptible for censorship with so many shady sites blocking our sights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how &quot;activist&quot; subreddits (what few there are) like conspiracy and hailcorporate get labeled as &quot;losing credibility.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing lower, with less credibility, more pathetic than a shill.  Somebody that would betray their neighbor and country to protect Obama, GMOs, BP, nuclear waste producers, etc.  Shills are the bloody shit that rolls off the backside of the human race.  But yes, they smell bad and are noticeable.</p>

<p>When somebody says that censorship is not as bad as &quot;losing face&quot;... it sounds a lot like the shill mods (<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>) that tell us they are &quot;cleaning things up&quot; for our own good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being honest with you, I came here after I left other communities which slowly turned up that way, and just sitting here reading mixed comments, some are well elaborated, and some just plain rude and destructive implying the way I expressed myself is of a &quot;shill&quot; because THEY THINK I&#39;m downplaying the censorship issue should tell you something, as if there can&#39;t be parallel issues along with the censorship.</p>

<p>I am just sharing my view in hopes to give back a little of what I was given in these months.</p>

<p>and the growing numbers are meaningless if the quality of the posts and users diminishes, so what if there is a new user everyday if his welcoming is being called &quot;shill&quot; or &quot;sheeple&quot; by some redneck prepper who&#39;s just waiting for the end of the world weekend after weekend just for questioning a little bit?</p>

<p>A good example since you cited my Syria false flag post which probably helped contribute to the war narrative of the establishment eroding from underneath them.  &#39;Fear porn&#39; sites like Infowars were reporting on the false flag nature of the conflict in Syria over a year and a half ago, they were one of the only outlets covering it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if there was legitimate information coming through the wire from one of the crazy sites?</p>

<p>You&#39;d risk losing good intel on the chance that you might have to read one of Alex Jones&#39;s crazier stories.</p>

<p>In a sub like this, geared towards questioning the lies we&#39;re told, where exactly can we accquire information if not from the other side of the media? </p>

<p>We can&#39;t trust any of ht MSM, they&#39;re all suspect and might as well be a loudspeaker for the government. Shouldn&#39;t trust most of the <em>prepers</em> either, they&#39;re out to make a profit off of people&#39;s fears.</p>

<p>However, you should be looking at everything. See what they say, what they don&#39;t say. Take notes, compare your notes. If anything, this sub should accept any and all sources, there are enough brains heres to vet every source as much as possible. </p>

<p>There are multiple sides in the war for our minds and it is up to us to discern which are good and bad and everything in between.</p>

<p>And as a parting note, let them call it a joke. Seriously. It&#39;s better if they do. Hopefully, they&#39;ll all continue to see truthseekers as nothing more than neckbearded, basement dwelling nerds. Because if they actually thought any of us were a threat...we&#39;ll i doubt we&#39;d be reading, posting and thinking any more.</p>

<p>The world is seemingly going to hell in a handbasket and I want to know why, who, how and what can be done to stop it. Those ends are not served but cutting ourselves off from potential sources of info. </p>

I&#39;m not one for censorship, but it doesn&#39;t matter either way.

<p>We&#39;ll see more and more &quot;predictions&quot; and &quot;My friend works in the military and said theres lots of talk about x situation&quot; and &quot;This comet is going to end all our lives&quot; and all the rest of these unverifiable, idiotic claims flood in here over the next few months too. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was onto something, we became a threat, we called out too many people and too many examples of censorship on this very site.

    <div class="md"><p>not all who enter the octagon are aware of what they engaging in...to negotiate the perils of shills, agents and bore worms is standard procedure for some, for others, they&#39;re just chatting with some guy in Peoria...One mans entertainment may be another&#39;s education, one mans education may be a quest to save the world...there are very few rules of engagement, primarily only one must be understood, that is, nothing is what it seems, it is the one constant. People come here, they watch tv, unaware of the evil of controlled opposition all around them, washed out, spun and cleansed, fully taken to the cleaners permanently pressed into a box of mental manipulations. Only true psychic warriors negotiate, with trepidation, the illusions of evil laid before all like a trap in a muddy bog on a cloudy night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, there are too many articles from sources at the extreme end of the spectrum where they are forcing their own agenda upon you and citing equally poor sources but the people of the subreddit have a right to vote for what they like/dislike and that&#39;s the way it should stay.</p>

<p>However, the major problem is still censorship; content shouldn&#39;t be removed just because it is challenging. There aren&#39;t many rules about the content that gets submitted here due to the very nature of the sub &quot;<em>conspiracy</em>&quot;.</p>
