    <div class="md"><p>Oh, it was on Direct TV. A segment hosted by Chris Wallace and he had guests discussing gun control while showing clips of terrified people while asking prepared softball questions to people who support all sorts of substantial changes to gun policy in America. He also cited some statistic that claimed 90% plus Americans supported increased gun control and/or increased background checks. The 90% statistic is likely fraudulent due to statistical tomfoolery by taking a pole from a non-random sample of people who happen to favor say total gun ban. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll post a clip to something on YouTube later, if I can find the footage online. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t see that particular segment but the &quot;90% for this and that&quot; has been thrown around on every MSM channel at some point(s) or another. It&#39;s completely bogus for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>We <strong>already have background checks</strong> as part of purchasing a firearm. Anyone who has done so and filled out a 4473 Form at a FFL knows this. Gun owners also support this, but it&#39;s <strong>already</strong> on the books. What we do not want is any additional legislation that is only going to impede law-abiding citizens.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that gun control is a solution looking for a problem -- a problem the government continues to fuel. Gun violence is down every single year. The previous efforts such as the Clinton AWB of 1994 did nothing and was not renewed in 2004 because it was worthless.</p>

<p>Gun owners are not against the discussion but the problem is most people bring emotion to the table instead of reasoning. We have a shooting that kills 20 people, everyone flips their shit about rifles which kill less than hands and feet each year. Oh but the handguns that kill thousands a year? Nah, don&#39;t give a fuck about that! Does that even make sense?</p>

<p>When someone blows up a building you don&#39;t blame bombs, you blame the bomber. When someone drinks and drives you don&#39;t blame the cars, you blame the irresponsible driver. Yet, when someone shoots up a school, movie theater, or military installation... it&#39;s the guns. Huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool thanks for filling me in on the background.</p>

<p>I am in no way qualified to talk about this stuff as the UK has such vastly different gun control systems than the US, and clearly that cultural bias fucks up any chance of us understanding one another.</p>

<p>FWIW, I come from rural UK where people having guns isn&#39;t weird at all and I know lots of gun owners, even though I am a total pacifist who has no interest in shooty things, I&#39;m glad my more err &#39;rugged&#39; mates can shoot and stuff.</p>

<p>i agree that we should protect ourselves. i think the best way to do that is global disarmament in conjunction with massive social reforms, not bloodshed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>controlled and manipulated far easier</p>

<p>so how was MLK manipulated? are schools still segregated, or did he win?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then someone who actually views their worth as a human being. </p>

<p>what makes you think that we pacifists don&#39;t value our worth as humans? i love myself, and i also love others enough to know that they aren&#39;t pure evil, and don&#39;t deserve to have holes poked through them to let their blood out. instead we need to talk, and sit-in, and convince all the middle class police and soldiers that they don&#39;t really want to put us all in camps.</p>

<p>that&#39;s what nelson mandela did, and world leaders from every country except probably israel have honored his successes.</p>

<p>i know you do. so do i. so do billions of other people on this planet. so there is really no need at all to be afraid and arm yourself. just trust that all of us will take care of you. when the 20-something riot cops with new babies at home who can&#39;t make ends meet on their crappy salaries see us feeding and caring for each other and welcoming them with open arms, i bet you anything they won&#39;t hurt us. they ARE us. we&#39;ve already won, we just need to realize that and show up in the streets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most people think King would be the last person to own a gun. Yet in the mid-1950s, as the civil rights movement heated up, King kept firearms for self-protection. In fact, he even applied for a permit to carry a concealed weapon.</p>

<p>A recipient of constant death threats, King had armed supporters take turns guarding his home and family. He had good reason to fear that the Klan in Alabama was targeting him for assassination.</p>

<p>William Worthy, a journalist who covered the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, reported that once, during a visit to King&#39;s parsonage, he went to sit down on an armchair in the living room and, to his surprise, almost sat on a loaded gun. Glenn Smiley, an adviser to King, described King&#39;s home as &quot;an arsenal.&quot;  </p>

<p>Even they knew that the right to protect oneself would require the means to do so. And by having armed guards protecting his family each night I would argue that indeed MLK did use guns during his fight for civil rights. You merely didn&#39;t hear about them being used because he nor his guards ever shot anyone. </p>

<p>With OIS you are dealing with a system that depends on being able to communicate in some manner with a violent person intent on harming you. That is a perfect world scenario that doesn&#39;t lend itself well to the realities of life. Mental health of some individuals or a state of drug-induced hysteria can sometimes make the best and only method of communication a swift and decisive incapacitating one. The ability of an individual of any size, stature or level of strength to respond with a higher level of force than is possible from any attacker, regardless of mental state or level of mania. A great equalizer if you will.</p>

<p>IIRC they didn&#39;t have cell phones and the internet in gandhi&#39;s time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>let&#39;s be serious here. MLK and gandhi are known for espousing the philosophy on nonviolence. if MLK cheated on his wife you wouldn&#39;t say he used marital infidelity in his civil rights struggle. nobody is perfect. did his armed guards stop him from being shot anyway? that sorta proves that militarism is futile. you know what would have stopped him from being shot? a big-ass flash mob surrounding him. and a bulletproof vest. </p>

<p>that&#39;s not true at all. if the client is unable to communicate their needs, we assign an advocate for them.</p>

<p>do you realize how many drones, tanks, satellites, and WMDs the government has? there is no equalizing that. if you were talking about street crime, guns are far from the best solution to the problem.</p>

<p>sometimes the best solution to a problem isn&#39;t a higher level of force, it&#39;s a smarter application of force. would there be more suffering in the world if everyone was armed and we all fended for ourselves, or if no one was armed (even the government) and we all took care of each other?</p>

<p>Call up your flash mob when an armed intruder is breaking into your home in the middle of the night, see where that gets you. This may be the most ridiculous thing I&#39;ve ever heard an anti-gunner say! You have opened my eyes to the way you folks think for sure!

<p>So if situation X works this way then it must follow that situation Z works exactly the same way? I don&#39;t follow your apples to oranges comparison. Tell me how this group home is in anyway like an attack from a coked-up nutjob bent on taking your life?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Only? No. That&#39;s why I said &quot;Mental health of some individuals or a state of drug-induced hysteria can sometimes make the best and only method of communication a swift and decisive incapacitating one.&quot; That word <strong>sometimes</strong> means your blanket statement of &quot;only&quot; seems like an intentional misrepresentation of what I actually said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you were talking about street crime, guns are far from the best solution to the problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am. And your opinion is worthy of consideration, and ultimately it is up to the individual to make that decision. Best solution for you may not be the best solution for someone else. It is their right to make their own decision.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree with the smarter application of force technique as well. Would the world be better off if I could snap my fingers and make every gun disappear? Damn right, and I would do it in a heartbeat. But the genie is out of the bottle. You can&#39;t make guns disappear, especially with the new open-source 3D printing designs and manufacturing capabilities that technology has brought forth. They will never go away. Do you know why? Because if you make a law that says you can&#39;t have a gun then the only people who won&#39;t have guns are those that follow the laws. The ones who do not, (criminals, by definition,) would not turn in their guns. They would continue to do what criminals do.</p>

<p>Would I like to live in a perfect world where no one has a use for guns? Yes. I myself don&#39;t own a gun. (I take that back, I own a reproduction 1864 Army cap and ball revolver, but with no projectiles and no black powder in the house it is merely a mantelpiece conversation starter, art if you will.) But my problem is with rights and the freedom of an individual to make decisions about their own future. I would fight for your right to NOT own a gun. I would never say that a law had to come about that would force you to own one, that would be wrong. In the same respect I would never want a law to be made saying that no one were able to own a gun. I would never want to force one to give up that right, that too would be wrong. I never wish to take away anyone&#39;s rights, and I would in fact take up arms to fight against those who would. Like those who wish to take guns away from law abiding citizens... someone like yourself.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s be honest, like George Orwell said in his <em>Notes on Nationalism</em> writings, &quot;Those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf.&quot; You and the pacifists like you exist only because others are willing to fight for your right to not do anything to protect yourself. The police officer with the sidearm on his hip, the soldier with the rifle on his shoulder and the citizen standing up to a possible future tyrannical government coming to imprison you.</p>

<p>Your perfect world doesn&#39;t exist and it never will. Until we as a society are able to take on the more pressing issue, like increasing money for research and treatment of the rampant mental health issues this country faces, until then we will still need those who are willing to fight and die so you and yours can sit at home and claim a higher morality or whatever you pacifists claim. </p>

<p>oh, is that what the second amendment is for? street crime? do you call your well-regulated militia for street crime?</p>

<p>why do some people have intruders break into their houses weekly, while other go an entire lifetime with no guns and no intruders?</p>

<p>no, if he was using guns for civil rights he would have had armed marches and armed sit-ins, and done all the gun-related stuff that soldiers do. he advocated political change through non-violence, and he succeeded. schools are no longer segregated, and they used non-violence to accomplish it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assign an advocate to the crack head with a knife running at you and your family. </p>

<p>we do. none of these things happen in a vacuum. that crackhead is a person with a life who lives in misery, forgotten by a selfish society who would rather kill or imprison that person than actually acknowledge their humanity and help them (thereby avoiding the hypothetical knife attack in the first place). it&#39;s very convenient to ignore the first couple decades of the criminal&#39;s suffering, and only demand a solution to a problem when it fits your ideology. build a better society, and you will benefit by not having to live in fear anymore. and who knows, maybe that crackhead is a neighbor or a relative of yours that you won&#39;t have to grieve. it&#39;s win-win!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me how this group home is in anyway like an attack from a coked-up nutjob bent on taking your life?</p>

<p>see above. you know who lives in group homes, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>your blanket statement of &quot;only&quot; seems like an intentional misrepresentation of what I actually said.</p>

<p>well i certainly don&#39;t want to misrepresent you. so since you said sometimes people need to be incapacitated, let&#39;s brainstorm some ways that society can be kept safe without resorting to murder. i&#39;ll throw out a few, just to get us going: giant nets, sticky foam, riot shields, sensory overload, kind words</p>

<p>now you try to brainstorm a few ways to incapacitate someone without poking holes through their organs until they&#39;re dead forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is their right to make their own decision.</p>

<p>okay, i decide that i want to protect my home with weaponized ebola. do you think i should be allowed to wield ebola for my own protection? is that my right? if not, why not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because if you make a law that says you can&#39;t have a gun then the only people who won&#39;t have guns are those that follow the laws.</p>

<p>then let&#39;s not use laws to solve the problem. maybe some brainstorming is in order. what are some other ways we could make gun violence obsolete using the philosophy of OIS that all behaviors are a (possibly misguided) attempt to meet a personal need? </p>

<p>again, i&#39;ll start to get things going: more access to education, rehabilitative corrections systems, more equitable distribution of resources. all these things would serve to decrease gun crime without needing more guns.</p>

<p>human history is characterized by doing things one way, then figuring out a better way. the second amendment was great before we understood as a species that we&#39;re all stuck on this one finite planet, with no man having greater rights to its resources than anyone else. we&#39;ve got everything we need to transcend violence as a species.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>i want to provide the supports (following the OIS method) that allow people to find a better way to meet their needs than resorting to violence. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A well regulated militia consists of armed individuals that are capable of not only defending their country from attack as a group but also of defending themselves and their family as an individual. Yes, that would be one of the benefits of having a society with the individual right to choose to arm themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>guns are technology. pepper spray is technology. fancy security systems and door locks are technology. all those things are possible tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do admit, they are in fact technology. But of course your statement was &quot;cell phones and the internet&quot;, which would have no chance of stopping a hell-bent attacker; it&#39;s more likely that would be the technology I was referring to. The police would have a recording of you dying if you managed to call 911, so there&#39;s that going for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he advocated political change through non-violence, and he succeeded. schools are no longer segregated, and they used non-violence to accomplish it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... while using guns to protect his family... during the civil right movement. Your statement of &quot;the bottom line is that he didn&#39;t use guns during the civil rights struggle&quot; would mean that he never once used guns during this time, which is false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>build a better society, and you will benefit by not having to live in fear anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Start by curing the sickness of mental health disorders and drug addiction first, don&#39;t remove the right of others to defend themselves in the event you fail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you know who lives in group homes, don&#39;t you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, so they have to be IN the group home for this to work. And you have all of the bad people in those group homes now do you? Great! It&#39;s safe then! Oh, you don&#39;t? Well then... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>now you try to brainstorm a few ways to incapacitate someone without poking holes through their organs until they&#39;re dead forever</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like your idea of big sticky nets. That sounds pretty cool! When I want to incapacitate someone I want the most effective way possible. If someone threatens my life or the lives of those I love I want the threat to go away as quickly and efficiently as possible. A firearm would do that just fine. But then, that is up to the individual, isn&#39;t it? That is their right. Your have your rights, and the rest of society has theirs! Let&#39;s allow the individual to make those decisions, not mandate specifics... that&#39;s how freedom works!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i decide that i want to protect my home with weaponized ebola.  do you think i should be allowed to wield ebola for my own protection? is that my right? if not, why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be against the laws that already exist. No it is not your right, it is against the law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i wasn&#39;t aware that you are able to telepathically see the future and tell me what will happen until eternity. because that&#39;s the only way the above sentence could possibly be true. we can do anything we set our minds to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes we can do anything we set our minds to. And there is a large percentage of society that do not want guns to disappear. Hunters, target shoters and recreational shooters would not want that. So they would negate the whole arguement because they would be inclined to set their minds to keeping them around. The only way you can make an object go away completely is to replace it with something better or more efficient. Better guns are on the way, don&#39;t worry!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>again, i&#39;ll start to get things going: more access to education, rehabilitative corrections systems, more equitable distribution of resources. all these things would serve to decrease gun crime without needing more guns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All great things! I do mostly agree with you there. And all can be accomplished without taking away anyone&#39;s rights! If there were no mental health issues, poverty issues or inequality between mankind then gun crime would be an almost distant memory, for sure. But until those problems have a solution the answer is not to remove an ability to defend yourself from imminent demise while taking away rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>human history is characterized by doing things one way, then figuring out a better way. the second amendment was great before we understood as a species that we&#39;re all stuck on this one finite planet, with no man having greater rights to its resources than anyone else. we&#39;ve got everything we need to transcend violence as a species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. And the 2nd amendment is still great today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m sure you want only the best for us all. there are billions of us like that. i think that&#39;s a very hopeful place to start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i want to provide the supports (following the OIS method) that allow people to find a better way to meet their needs than resorting to violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. While at the same time respecting the individual&#39;s rights and their ability to choose how they wish to protect themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>okay, well i&#39;m barred by law from owning nuclear weapons. my right to self-defense is being violated! so are you gonna start shooting people now, or wait for dawn? what&#39;s the plan, generalissimo?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Owning a nuke is not a self-defense option, never has been and never will be. It has never been legal to do so, no one has taken or is trying to take away a right. No problem then. I own no guns, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be shooting anyone at dawn. So far there are still jurisdictions that value and uphold the constitutional right of the individual to keep and bear arms, so until the last jurisdiction to do so becomes extinct I see no reason to become violent. But using our words to fight those who are trying right now is beneficial, and letting them know where we will draw the line is also a good thing to do so there are no misunderstandings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>were cell phones and the internet invented when he said that? if not, he may have been speaking prematurely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes no sense. You can now in today&#39;s society be nonviolent because cell phones and internet exist? Police and warriors are no longer needed? Do tell...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that&#39;s kinda funny, because these are the people who make my neighbors live in fear of being arrested, or bombed, or threatened. so thanks for that &quot;gift&quot; of violence we never asked for, but no thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I too fear them. Armed men who at any time could turn to violent oppression... gee, if only there were some great equalizer that we had to help prevent that from happening...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>spooky psychic powerrrrrs!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or a grasp of reality and learning lessons from history. Mankind has never lived peacefully and in complete harmony with one another ever in our past. Does it mean I don&#39;t want a perfect future or think we shouldn&#39;t strive for it? Hell no. But I won&#39;t hold my breath...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;ll take my chances without your &quot;gifts&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, you don&#39;t have to take your chances as long as you live in a country where others are willing to do the dirty work for you! Take your chances elsewhere if you prefer, but it would be a shame to lose those like you who are fighting to make a better world here. Even though you have your priorities out of whack it seems... taking the guns away before you solve the problems that lead to increased violence while simultaneously opening up the chance for the innocent to be harmed by those who have the problems... that seems like a cart before the horse approach. Solve societies ills before you start taking away rights. Then I would support every word you say... until you start talking about taking away rights again.</p>

<p>It has been nice chatting with you so far. Glad to see a conversation that didn&#39;t devolve into mindless name-calling and silliness. Thank you for interacting about this.</p>

<p>depends on which &quot;they&quot; you&#39;re talking about i suppose. if you&#39;re referring to the post-columbine stuff, i seem to remember something about machine guns. is that what you meant?</p>

<p>Why do you suppose they would be interested in focusing on those specific types of weapons?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you&#39;d have to ask them, but my first guess would be the danger? same reason nukes are illegal for civilians to own.</p>

<p>do you support civilian nuke ownership? how about biological weapons?</p>

<p>Kind of. </p>

<p>But you DO realize that no &quot;machine gun&quot; was used at Columbine, nor in any notable civilian homicide in the US since, right? (A &quot;machine gun&quot; being a FULLY AUTOMATIC weapon (one trigger squeeze = multiple shots), whereas the typical &quot;Assault Rifle&quot; is a SEMI-automatic weapon (one trigger squeeze = one single shot).</p>

<p>You knew that, right?</p>

<p>Were you aware that the types of firearms (&quot;Assault Weapons&quot;) that the likes of Obama, Holder and Feinsten urgently seek to ban were used in fewer than <strong>2.5%</strong> of all homicides committed in 2011?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/z6gy5eP.jpg">Have a look at the FBI stats.</a></p>

<p>OTOH, FBI stats show that <strong>handguns</strong> were the weapon used in <strong>nearly half</strong> of all homicides committed in 2011.</p>

<p>So, if the goal of these blessed and omniscient politicians is to REDUCE FIREARMS DEATHS (as they claim), why are they focusing on firearms that are rarely used in homicides (&quot;Assault weapons&quot;), rather than those that are used in the vast MAJORITY of homicides (handguns)?</p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t want to give you a left-brain headache, so I&#39;ll tell you: So-called &quot;Assault weapons&quot; are relatively USELESS in common, daily, run-of-the-mill homicides - an arena in which handguns (which, while being relatively inaccurate) are far easier to conceal for surprise one-on-one attacks) are FAR more practical.</p>

<p>So-called &quot;Assault Weapons&quot;, OTOH, are MUCH more effective in situations where there is opposition wherein &quot;rebel&quot; actors are opposing  totalitarian regimes. (That is why the US has been supplying &quot;assault weapons&quot; rather than handguns to those opposing the likes of Assad.</p>

<p>Feinstein, Obama and friends have little fear of handguns, as they are all but useless in insurrection. &quot;Assault weapons&quot;, OTOH, can be quite effective under such circumstances - which is why the would-be totalitarians FEAR them.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: The anti-gun crusaders are NOT interested in protecting citizens from &quot;gun violence&quot;. They are interested in protecting THEIR POWER BASE.</p>

<p>And they DEPEND on uninformed dupes like you to help them to sustain their grip on power and control.</p>

<p>Does that make sense., or will you be needing a remedial course in logic?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you DO realize that no &quot;machine gun&quot; was used <strong>at Columbine</strong>, nor in any notable civilian homicide in the <strong>US since</strong>, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weasel like typing detected!</p>

<p>You intentionally deleted the word &quot;since&quot; in a pathetic, dishonest effort to push your agenda:</p>

<p>Hollywood Shootout: <strong>February 28, 1997</strong> (the bank robbers were the ONLY ones killed - so NO CIVILIAN HOMICIDE)</p>

<p>Columbine incident: <strong>April 20, 1999</strong></p>

<p>Also, bear in mind that the firearms used in the Hollywood shootout were ALREADY ILLEGAL.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be a dishonest weasel, <strong>doubleherpes</strong>.</p>

<p>Your momentary lapse of honesty aside, I&#39;m sure that you&#39;re a well-intended (if incredibly naive) lad/lass, but I&#39;m afraid that there are some serious flaws in your &quot;logic&quot;, the primary one being your failure to realize that the problem that spawns your struggle lies not in inanimate objects (firearms and other weapons) but in HUMAN NATURE.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a good-guy, I&#39;m a good-guy. Most people are decent. Problem is that not ALL people think like you and I. The world is contaminated with reprobate sociopaths who seek to control, dominate and spitefully use people like you and I. These asshats see people like you as &quot;useful idiots&quot; - tools to be exploited to further their pernicious agenda. </p>

<p>The stupider of these wind up dead, or in prison. The more clever of these wind up with TITLES like CEO, Congressman, Senator, Prime Minister, or Mr. President - and they have NO intention of EVER relinquishing THEIR power, only gaining MORE power, and they do so by using LYING WEASEL WORDS (you know about those, right?) at first, and then by ruthless brute force - especially effective when those they seek to oppress and subjugate have been DISARMED and can no longer resist.</p>

<p>Do you dream of a world in which such soulless sociopaths do not exist? Where everyone works together for the common good in a spirit of love, compassion, empathy and unity?</p>

<p>Me too. </p>

<p>Problem is that we BOTH wake up every day to the reality where they DO exist, and they will FUCK YOU OVER to the extent that they can get away with, and the ONLY thing that prevents them from totalitarian abuse is the ability of DECENT people to resist - by force, if necessary.</p>

<p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but that&#39;s the reality we live in, and you&#39;re not going to change a disease of the heart, soul and core nature of humanity by outlawing high-tech sticks and stones.</p>

<p>Perhaps we&#39;ll evolve as a species?</p>

<p>That would be cool.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>A well regulated militia consists of armed individuals that are capable of not only defending their country from attack as a group but also of defending themselves and their family as an individual. Yes, that would be one of the benefits of having a society with the individual right to choose to arm themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>guns are technology. pepper spray is technology. fancy security systems and door locks are technology. all those things are possible tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do admit, they are in fact technology. But of course your statement was &quot;cell phones and the internet&quot;, which would have no chance of stopping a hell-bent attacker; it&#39;s more likely that would be the technology I was referring to. The police would have a recording of you dying if you managed to call 911, so there&#39;s that going for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he advocated political change through non-violence, and he succeeded. schools are no longer segregated, and they used non-violence to accomplish it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... while using guns to protect his family... during the civil right movement. Your statement of &quot;the bottom line is that he didn&#39;t use guns during the civil rights struggle&quot; would mean that he never once used guns during this time, which is false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>build a better society, and you will benefit by not having to live in fear anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Start by curing the sickness of mental health disorders and drug addiction first, don&#39;t remove the right of others to defend themselves in the event you fail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you know who lives in group homes, don&#39;t you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, so they have to be IN the group home for this to work. And you have all of the bad people in those group homes now do you? Great! It&#39;s safe then! Oh, you don&#39;t? Well then... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>now you try to brainstorm a few ways to incapacitate someone without poking holes through their organs until they&#39;re dead forever</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like your idea of big sticky nets. That sounds pretty cool! When I want to incapacitate someone I want the most effective way possible. If someone threatens my life or the lives of those I love I want the threat to go away as quickly and efficiently as possible. A firearm would do that just fine. But then, that is up to the individual, isn&#39;t it? That is their right. Your have your rights, and the rest of society has theirs! Let&#39;s allow the individual to make those decisions, not mandate specifics... that&#39;s how freedom works!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i decide that i want to protect my home with weaponized ebola.  do you think i should be allowed to wield ebola for my own protection? is that my right? if not, why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be against the laws that already exist. No it is not your right, it is against the law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i wasn&#39;t aware that you are able to telepathically see the future and tell me what will happen until eternity. because that&#39;s the only way the above sentence could possibly be true. we can do anything we set our minds to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes we can do anything we set our minds to. And there is a large percentage of society that do not want guns to disappear. Hunters, target shoters and recreational shooters would not want that. So they would negate the whole arguement because they would be inclined to set their minds to keeping them around. The only way you can make an object go away completely is to replace it with something better or more efficient. Better guns are on the way, don&#39;t worry!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>again, i&#39;ll start to get things going: more access to education, rehabilitative corrections systems, more equitable distribution of resources. all these things would serve to decrease gun crime without needing more guns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All great things! I do mostly agree with you there. And all can be accomplished without taking away anyone&#39;s rights! If there were no mental health issues, poverty issues or inequality between mankind then gun crime would be an almost distant memory, for sure. But until those problems have a solution the answer is not to remove an ability to defend yourself from imminent demise while taking away rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>human history is characterized by doing things one way, then figuring out a better way. the second amendment was great before we understood as a species that we&#39;re all stuck on this one finite planet, with no man having greater rights to its resources than anyone else. we&#39;ve got everything we need to transcend violence as a species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. And the 2nd amendment is still great today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m sure you want only the best for us all. there are billions of us like that. i think that&#39;s a very hopeful place to start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i want to provide the supports (following the OIS method) that allow people to find a better way to meet their needs than resorting to violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. While at the same time respecting the individual&#39;s rights and their ability to choose how they wish to protect themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>okay, well i&#39;m barred by law from owning nuclear weapons. my right to self-defense is being violated! so are you gonna start shooting people now, or wait for dawn? what&#39;s the plan, generalissimo?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Owning a nuke is not a self-defense option, never has been and never will be. It has never been legal to do so, no one has taken or is trying to take away a right. No problem then. I own no guns, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be shooting anyone at dawn. So far there are still jurisdictions that value and uphold the constitutional right of the individual to keep and bear arms, so until the last jurisdiction to do so becomes extinct I see no reason to become violent. But using our words to fight those who are trying right now is beneficial, and letting them know where we will draw the line is also a good thing to do so there are no misunderstandings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>were cell phones and the internet invented when he said that? if not, he may have been speaking prematurely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes no sense. You can now in today&#39;s society be nonviolent because cell phones and internet exist? Police and warriors are no longer needed? Do tell...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that&#39;s kinda funny, because these are the people who make my neighbors live in fear of being arrested, or bombed, or threatened. so thanks for that &quot;gift&quot; of violence we never asked for, but no thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I too fear them. Armed men who at any time could turn to violent oppression... gee, if only there were some great equalizer that we had to help prevent that from happening...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>spooky psychic powerrrrrs!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or a grasp of reality and learning lessons from history. Mankind has never lived peacefully and in complete harmony with one another ever in our past. Does it mean I don&#39;t want a perfect future or think we shouldn&#39;t strive for it? Hell no. But I won&#39;t hold my breath...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;ll take my chances without your &quot;gifts&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, you don&#39;t have to take your chances as long as you live in a country where others are willing to do the dirty work for you! Take your chances elsewhere if you prefer, but it would be a shame to lose those like you who are fighting to make a better world here. Even though you have your priorities out of whack it seems... taking the guns away before you solve the problems that lead to increased violence while simultaneously opening up the chance for the innocent to be harmed by those who have the problems... that seems like a cart before the horse approach. Solve societies ills before you start taking away rights. Then I would support every word you say... until you start talking about taking away rights again.</p>

<p>It has been nice chatting with you so far. Glad to see a conversation that didn&#39;t devolve into mindless name-calling and silliness. Thank you for interacting about this.</p>
