    <div class="md"><p>Socialism: a way of organizing a society in which major industries are owned and controlled by the government rather than by individual people and companies</p>

<p>Businesses and government agencies are extremely intertwined. They routinely share/swap members, campaign contributions, lobbying etc. If you want to talk about the US, it is a perfect example. Socialism for all areas of society. The businesses end up being almost indistinguishable from government, which means you should just label them &quot;government.&quot; If the government controls the media, the media <em>is government.</em> If the government uses technology companies to spy on everyone, then those tech companies <em>are government</em>. </p>

<p>Republic-&gt; Democracy (voters vote themselves government benefits)-&gt; socialism (like we have today)-&gt;communism (coming soon). The difference is I think it will be global communism instead of isolated tyranny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the real fight is for freedom and privacy. If your government is giving you neither then is it still a Democracy? We have to have a mix of collectivism and individualism otherwise we will end up a society that is lopsided in favor of one or the other and would be completely disfunctional. I think we can do that without caving to our deepest fears and being stuck in a cycle of absolute personal greed. It will take our individual efforts focused on a collective goal to do so but I think is doable. Whether or not people are smart enough to take a step back and actually look at themselves and how they behave with a microscope psychologically and socially speaking that waits to be seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear god we as the collective we. YES people do make their own decisions but those decisions are limited by the rules WE as a collective society create. There can only be a melding of individualism and collectivism. A society entirely built for just the individual would not be a society at all while a society built entirely out of collectivism would be very oppressive. There has to be balance for society to work. Also we accept social norms and laws collectively every day without coercion and force making the whole point you think your making wrong from the start.

    <div class="md"><p>No.. mass acceptance is what keeps these rules in place. If people didn&#39;t accept them they would not exist. People don&#39;t need to be coerced into believing theft and murder is wrong. The majority of people collectively decided the laws and the consequences for breaking those laws. We also made collectively the exceptions for those rules and their various concequences. </p>

<p>For example on mentally disabled man who gets behind the wheel and kills a person is placed into a mental home instead of prison where a fully functional sane man can get life in prison or the death penalty. We as a society collectively decided what was appropriate.</p>

<p>If everyone decided things on an individual basis there would not be any actual law or consequences. It would be like the wild west before sheriffs moved in. If a person murdered a family member or stole something there would be only blind revenge seeking behavior. </p>

<p>If we decided everything on a collective basis as we are currently moving into and the Russians and Germans did in the past. We can see that we would have exteme paranoia as a result. Distrust of fellow man leads people to jump for privacy invasion as the recourse. The germans and russians both had their own form of secret police who would prevent opposing voices from ever being heard. All the while hundreds of thousands of people were being killed. </p>

<p>We as in the human race have experienced both extremes and we can see they are flawed deeply. Functional societies always have achieved balance historically. Balance between Rich and Poor, Left and Right, Conservative and Liberal, Collectivist and Individualist. Every time We as humanity get unbalanced societal collapse or disfunction occurs.</p>

<p>I would rather people take the lessons of history to heart and try to find balance between the extremes. The alternative is the end of civilization and the death of the human race as we have already damaged the environment. </p>
