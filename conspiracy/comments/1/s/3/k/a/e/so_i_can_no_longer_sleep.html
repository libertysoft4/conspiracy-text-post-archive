        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When they say ignorance is bliss, they couldn&#39;t be any closer to the truth. Like myself do any of you remember a time when you were happily unaware of what is actually going on around us? When you cared more for your favorite tv show being cancelled rather than the war in the middle east? Or thinking about a certain person you wanted to date instead of the government passing more gun control laws? Im not depressed but im certainly no longer happy. I remember thinking that no American wars were unjust and the patriot act was only for our safety. And that was only a few years ago. My mindset has really changed over the last few years and I have come to realize that the constitution is now a piece of paper used by politicians to wipe their asses.  Somewhere someone is being either illegally detained, tortured, murdered, or oppressed. Virtually every government in the world is corrupt. With this knowledge i can no longer stop my mind from racing while I&#39;m in bed. I roll out of bed with a few hours of sleep and continue my day only to see more news reports of the dead or new laws being passed for out protection.</p>

<p>It can only last so long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, I know it can feel heavy with all the stuff we read about here daily and to think it&#39;s only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t lie, there are nights where I feel restless and can&#39;t sleep while my mind races.</p>

<p>Would I change it for ignorance? Nah, I don&#39;t want the blue pill. It&#39;s just a balance that you need to work out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s good to prepare. It&#39;s good to be aware. It&#39;s good to stand strong and exercise your rights.</p>

<p>However, don&#39;t let it burn you out. There&#39;s only so much you can do as a single person right now. Don&#39;t worry, there will come a time when your efforts will be very important, it won&#39;t be long from now.</p>

<p>Just enjoy your days while they are still normal. Have a nice steak or dessert. Enjoy time with your loved ones and friends. One day things will change and you&#39;ll miss these &quot;boring&quot; days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing it incrementally. </p>

<p>First step, being adequately armed and having ammo. Milsurp rifles can be had on the cheap, as can shotguns.</p>

<p>Next is starting the garden and having water purification supplies. MREs and canned goods aren&#39;t bad for a start either.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also recommend keeping sets of plastic cutlery and paper plates/bowls. Remember having food is good, but the goal is eating it too. Aluminum foil is quite useful too, makes cooking smaller things on a grill/fire easier.</p>

<p>If you need to charge your devices (GPS, compass, camera, etc), there are solar/hand crank products that may be helpful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t even know there was a rabbit hole, just like other parts of the population didn&#39;t see it or refuse to acknowledge it... Then you found it existed and decided to take a look. Most do not and continue on their merry little way knowing that something is wrong but not really having the care to find out more.
Some of us do, most of us don&#39;t. Some even know, but decide to chastise those going into the hole. Make them feel stupider for even questioning things at all.</p>

<p>And you can never reemerge from the rabbit hole from the same way you came in. You simply must continue through until you come out the other side. Alice was a changed person after the trip - so is anyone who actually researches what the truth of the state of things is. It changes you. Makes you cynical or distrustful of common things. Angry in others for not caring and putting up the same amount of energy (or an obvious attempt) as you did. It is infuriating!</p>

<p>But it is simultaneously uplifting and freeing - you no longer question if its the truth because you see right through it. The veil means nothing to those with vision: you don&#39;t need sight to see, you need vision. Vision comes from from wisdom. Wisdom comes from knowledge that was information that you can now use.</p>

<p>Data -&gt; Information -&gt; Knowledge -&gt; Wisdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool story bro. so what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>If youre going to follow some of the advice people left, then you might aswell go back to sleep and start caring about football or the Kardashians. </p>

<p>This is a defeatist mentality, and your cycle of unhappiness WILL turn into depression the longer you stay &quot;out of the matrix&quot; (for lack of a better expression) and remain docile and wallowing in it.</p>

<p>OR, you can slam your fist down and flip your fucking desk. Yell &quot;FUCK THIS SHIT&quot; and start making a difference. handing out flyers, rubbing elbows with the right people, billboards, music, videos; fuck just stand in the middle of the street downtown and YELL the truth for everyone to hear. Id rather get a bullet put in my brain fighting this tyranny, than Uncle Sams dick in my ass for going with the flow.</p>

<p>Youve got to get <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WINDtlPXmmE">MAD</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>You have knowledge, secret knowledge. &quot;secret&quot; in the sense that a sheep doesnt know, or understand. Therefore YOU have a responsibility to keep, and thats to spread the knowledge. You are at an advantage over the mindless waves of sheep, and you must use that advantage yourself not for personal reasons like the criminals, but for the good of humanity.</p>

<p>You are 1 person, but the difference you can make is HUGE. MLK was arrested over a hundred times. a man with groceries was able to instill fear in tyranny and hope in masses by simply standing infront of a tank for a few minutes. YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a damn liar.</p>

<p>I know alot of people have seen this and im beating a dead horse but its relevant: with a cheap megaphone, a piece of plastic tarp and red tape my friend and i were able to send a message to the white house sometime ago. If we can do this with nothing but knowledge and passion fueling and motivating us, what do you think YOU can do?

<p>Dont succumb to the system, fight it.
 Like many things in life, it only has power and authority because the people believe they do. Power, no matter where it stands can disappear in moments if everyone shrugs their shoulders and face the other way</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!!!  I have given up trying to win people over with rational arguments.  The evidence is so obvious at this point, anyone who is unaware does not want to know.  </p>

<p>Instead I spend my time broadcasting messages of dissent as a way of letting all the other pissed off people know they are not alone.  Find a group of like minded friends, and schedule weekly meetings to discuss current events and plan for the worst.  It is like group therapy for activists, dissidents, and prepers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone feels this way right now so you&#39;re not alone. Take the steps that you can take right now. Past that, it&#39;s God&#39;s Will and what will happen will happen. All you can do is be ready. Here&#39;s the steps I&#39;ve taken and continue to take:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your family and loved ones aware of how you feel and why. Explain to them why you are stressed and why you are taking the steps you are.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit your exposure to the dollar. The QE bubble has to pop sooner or later. Buy real estate, buy bitcoins, exchange dollars for other currencies and/or gold. Anything. Just don&#39;t be left hanging with all your money in dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>BUY A RIFLE. Do not wait. </p></li>
<li><p>Have food and water on hand. God forbid there is ever a shortage.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak out. If ALL of us continue to SPEAK up about and call out the FUCKING FRAUDULENT pieces of shit that are destroying this country, there will be too many to round up just based on internet chatter. OBAMA IS A PSYCHOPATH MURDERER, there I said it.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept death and pray to God. Don&#39;t be afraid to die standing up for what you believe in. They can take your life but not your soul. Whether you believe in God or Blind Chance, we all must come to terms with the fact that some things are simply out of our hands. Say a prayer to Jesus Christ or The Spaghetti Monster, tell your family and friends you love them and have fun and enjoy life while you have it.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>My daughter is in a very troubling class in college. It covers a lot of the stuff you ticked off.</p>

<p>Her professor is idealistic and action-oriented. So is my daughter.</p>

<p>As she learned more and more about all the bullshit in the world, she found herself in much the same position as you.</p>

<p>She asked her professor, who has been embroiled in this for decades longer than she has, how he copes. How he sleeps. How he doesn&#39;t go crazy.</p>

<p>His answer came down to, paraphrased, pick your battles and do the best you can and learn to live with that being the best any of us can do.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the good news:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nobody is going to knock on your door any time soon and demand your gun(s).</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody is going to drag you out of your house, put an M-16 in your hand, ship you off to the Middle East, and tell you to start shooting at anyone with light brown skin.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody is going to drag you out of bed and throw you in prison (assuming you&#39;ve committed no crimes).</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody is forcing you to ingest GMOs, HFCS, aspartame, pesticides, or any of the thousands of other biological and chemical agents in our food.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody has taken your family or friends or pets or whatever makes you happy from you.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody has taken away your right to vote (assuming you&#39;re not a convicted felon and you&#39;re a citizen).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to do something, pick a battle. Make it one you care about. <strong>One.</strong> Then do something about it. When you can. As time permits. And not neglecting all the other things that are important in life, like family, friends, and happiness.</p>

<p>For those things are what the battle is ultimately about anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was already disappointed with the state of the world before I fell down the rabbit hole. At that time, I had concluded that all the problems on this earth were merely the extension of some intrinsic human flaw -- that it could not be better simply because people are no better.</p>

<p>Then, some day, I fell in, and soon realized that I had been mislead; that there are indeed well organized, malicious forces plotting behind the scenes, on a scale barely imaginable to the average mind. At first, this insight was terrifying and intimidating, but it soon dawned on me that it also meant that a lot of the suffering on this planet was indeed <em>not</em> inevitable. That there is a real chance to change the world for the better -- and that is a pretty powerful perspective.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s been some years, and the war isn&#39;t yet won, but there has undoubtedly been much progress. Public consciousness has seriously evolved since then, and basically performed a 180 in the skepticism department. People <em>are</em> waking up, and once they&#39;re awake and ready to reclaim their sovereignty, they will not be denied -- can not be denied.</p>

You should take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mZ5FBHg0A">this video</a> I&#39;m showing this to as many people in hopes to wake some of then up, one person at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through a similar phase. I even started seeing a therapist. Know what her advice was? To &quot;stop researching&quot;. Least to say I stopped seeing her after that appointment. Eventually with time I mellowed out and came to terms with the disturbing reality we live in.  I used to be bothered by hearing what &quot;sheep&quot; said in terms of politics. Now it feels like my brain goes to auto-pilot and tunes them out.  Instead of forcing my viewpoint down others throats I just wait to feel them out. Call it a superiority feeling but it feels somewhat good to know that you&#39;re awake to the truth. Also, being cynical helps.  Someone somewhere will always be bent over and raw dogged by the elitist/bankers/government. But those same people are sacrificing themselves to help spread the word. It&#39;s like the conclusion in Fahrenheit  451, in the end we only have our word of mouth to pass on the truth. It&#39;s our true &quot;weapon of mass destruction&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember getting stuck here. You need to realize its not healthy to ruminate or compare yourself to someone other than yourself. I had a self post about this that I did a while back if ya wanna read it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that you have that awareness of what&#39;s actually going on in the world, but letting it effect your daily functioning is a borderline mental disorder. </p>

<p>You need social support in situations like this. They are the key to increasing happiness. That and being selfish and taking time to enjoy yourself. Life may suck for many in the world, but hurting yourself because of it, doesn&#39;t help anyone. Life isn&#39;t fair. Being religious also helps in this case. If you realize that grace is only available due to inequality and that Christ will reverse all wrongs, then you have no need to ruminate.</p>

<p>So, label me whatever you&#39;d like. It&#39;s all just name calling. But, I know that happiness comes from your perceptions and appraisals. You decide your destiny. You can choose to abuse yourself and trap your mind in a web of torture. Or, you can look past all the noise and realize that you&#39;re the only one making sound. </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to you, even if you don&#39;t realize it. All emotions are energy states and the energy you put out will effect the energy your receive and also how you interpret that energy.</p>

<p>Btw... A little weed might help your insomnia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through the same thing.  Learned a few important lessons.  My two cents- your experience is exactly what they&#39;re hoping for.  That&#39;s the reason that people like Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura are allowed to reach as broad an audience as they do.  It&#39;s (likely) some manner of psy-op, with the objective being to keep control over those who are starting to wake up.  Control you by keeping you up at night thinking about all the terrible and seemingly inevitable outcomes, by keeping you on edge, by making it hard to trust anyone, by getting you riled up over things that you can&#39;t stop, and by making you look crazy to the people around you.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bite.  Things are no worse now than they&#39;ve been any time throughout history.  The methods for controlling the masses have become more sophisticated.  That&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with now.  Media (mainstream and independent) will scream at you to be scared and that the world is upside down.  But remember this, fearing something/someone is acknowledging its power over you.  Live free and without fear.  This is how we end the insanity.  </p>

<p>If the world seems overwhelming and doom is behind every corner. Just do what you can to make it better. If the world is getting you down, go to the beach (or an equivalent place, either physical or mental, and enjoy the company of friends, remember what you are grateful for, create new stories and new experiences; enjoy life.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Infuse your days with moments of silence. Your mind is too busy with all of these things which is normal, but you have to give your mind a rest so you can start seeing more clearly. You do that by sitting in silence while observing your breath at least once a day preferably more.</p>

<p>In the beginning it will be hard, your body will seem to want to run all the time, you have a hard time sitting still or focusing on the breath because thoughts are distracting you. But don&#39;t worry, the process will deal with all of that itself, you don&#39;t need to fight your mind. You don&#39;t need to try to quieten it. It will happen on its own if you maintain a continues practice.</p>

<p>This kind of thing will bring more peace into your mind and body, only then can you start to feel happiness from the simple things in life.</p>

<p>The internet condenses all the suffering on earth into articles, videos, documentaries etc... You as a person can still look at these things and care for what is happening, but don&#39;t carry the pain of the world on your back, it makes your  mind clouded with too many emotions. Sometimes your mind needs a rest, do yourself a favor and do this practice of silence.</p>

<p>I personally like the Zazen method of meditation the most. The eyes are open but comfortable not too open not too closed. You look at the ground in front of you again no specific spot. And in the beginning you follow your breath by a mantra in your mind. When you breath in you say (in your mind) &quot;breath in&quot; &quot;breath out&quot;. You can sit on a cushion with your butt, your legs don&#39;t have to be in any lotus position (I don&#39;t do it that way) but I wouldn&#39;t advise crossing them. I put my legs parallel to each other so they don&#39;t cross but have a stable enough base to keep your body in a form of a tripod. The knees are two legs and the spine/butt are the third leg of the tripod. With your hands you can make a cosmic mudra (search google images) there is nothing mystical about it, its just something for your hands to do. Its also a good indicator of tension in the body, the two thumbs should touch each other lightly, when they start pushing hard you know you are tense or not mindful enough.</p>

<p>If this method doesn&#39;t suit you you can sit on a chair with your feet planted on the ground, hands resting on the legs either with the palm resting on the thigh or the hands clenched together in the &quot;prayer fist&quot; (don&#39;t know how to call it). Again the eyes should remain open, follow the breath, relax your body. Keep your back straight so it is easy to breath in from the belly. When the back is not straight you will feel as though its harder to breath. Again this isn&#39;t super crucial, but in the long run you should notice yourself that breathing with a straight back will be much better, it is also better to take up this habit for the sake of your back. </p>

<p>If you have problems or questions regarding the movement of the mind and what it is telling you, you can ask me and I will try to help. If you have never prayed or done anything remotely religious (not that meditation is) and you sit down to meditate it is possible that the mind will see itself as though it is doing something spiritual. The mind has many ideas about what meditation is and you will bring all of those ideas on your meditation. The longer you do it the more they will start to disappear, this stripping of layers will keep happening until you come closer to reality itself. You will start to notice that the mind has little to do with reality, the mind is pretty nutty if you keep an eye on it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the word meditation, let&#39;s just call it silent sitting, because that&#39;s really all it is. Meditation has become too heavy a term, its too loaded. One other delusion you will get into when you meditate is that you feel like you are doing an activity. You are going to feel as though your meditation is a tool to bring you somewhere. Silent sitting is not a tool, you don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; silent sitting. Silent sitting is just doing nothing, the longer you do the more you will understand this. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to stop here before Iv clouded your mind with too much bullshit, the mind is a deceptive fucker thats all you need to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While reading the comments here I was formulating a comment such as yours in my head, and then I came across yours.  Very well said.  I started meditating a few years ago and it does have profound consequences.  </p>

<p>One thing I learned that helped me quite a bit was from a spiritual teacher that pointed out that our thoughts are not are own.  They happen autonomously.  Just like our heart beats without thinking about it, our lungs breath without thinking about it, thoughts come from our brain without thinking about it.  If we were responsible for our thoughts we could tell them to stop but they don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>We can not stop our thoughts!  Not only that, our thoughts are not always friendly thoughts.  Lots of times our thoughts tell us we are jerks, ugly, losers, and maybe we should kill ourselves.  The point is we have no reason to trust our thoughts.  Study of consciousness, spirituality, and the ego, will tell you that identifying with the thoughts that you have is what reinforces the ego thus creating the separation of self and God, Duality.</p>

<p>What seems to confuse many is our ability to use our mind, thus thinking that we have control of our mind and making all of those thoughts ours.  A better was to see it is to picture our mind as a computer that only we have access to.  The computer is on and is constantly spewing information/data/code/headlines or however you would like to picture it.  Now once in a while we want to use it.  Something like how much is 2+2.  It gives us the answer and then goes right back to what it was doing.  Also notice that the thoughts (when we are not actually thinking) are almost always something in the past or future.  If your thoughts are in the past people are prone to regret and grief.  If your thoughts are in the future people are prone to fear.  Before I used to meditate I was just like the OP focused on the thoughts of the future and just about paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>The way to overcome this is to look at the thoughts as they come up and to not identify with them, to only see them as options, options that you get to choose.  With practice (meditation/contemplation) this becomes increasingly easier.  Then you begin to experience true peace.  </p>

<p>Once a person no-longer identifies with their thoughts (EGO) they can be said to be enlightened and the worries of this world no longer exist.  </p>

<p>I find myself being very depressed. It&#39;s not the best, granted, but it drives me to learn more. I feel when I understand something more (Like say, the plethora of reasons why marijuana has been kept illegal since Al Capone&#39;s days) it helps make it more manageable. When I can talk to someone and educate them or help open their eyes makes me feel even better. Spread knowledge to those who will listen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t live life in a bubble, but you can not live in fear either. The fear is the driving force of the opposition. Too be unafraid is to be victorious against their agenda. To also realize that this existence is a microscopic blip on the universal radar, then you can sleep a little easier. At least I do. I see beyond the fear, beyond what they want you to think, and live life in the present. May sound a little Buddhist, but that is where I get it from. Fear is the hindrance of humanity. Too live without fear is too live free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not alone. It may feel that way, but you aren&#39;t. I feel the same way, that I get to live with food everyday and a roof, while people are dying and starving. That we could be helping those people with the money we&#39;re spending on foreign wars and surveillance. The original Americans turned to fighting for what they believed in. Maybe it&#39;s high time the real Americans do the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are start up guides on the internet, I&#39;d link you but I&#39;m mobile at the moment.  I googled &quot;how to start a community garden&quot; and was surprised at the amount of info I found.  The parks dept. in your town should be able to give you info on land that&#39;s available, paperwork, etc.  Hope that helps!</p>
