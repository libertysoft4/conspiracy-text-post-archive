        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">282</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-12-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/dragonboltz.html">dragonboltz</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) The drones can only deliver a few packages at a time before having to return to base and pick up a new package? A delivery van can transport hundreds at once.</p>

<p>2) A delivery drone will not be able to operate safely in windy/rainy weather, and has a fairly limited range - a delivery van avoids most weather issues. </p>

<p>3) If drones fly too low - People could easily capture/shoot down delivery drones and steal the packages, especially if the drones do not record and transmit live footage (like the Amazon Air drones in the video). If they fly too high, they risk <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/234428/spy-drone-almost-causes-mid-air-collision-with-jet-over-denver">causing manned planes to crash.</a></p>

<p>4) Cats, dogs and birds will likely interfere with the drones, going as far as destroying them when they land in peoples yards. (Could be avoided by dropping packages I suppose? Risking damaging them). </p>

<p>5) Big privacy concerns - If the drones have cameras that record footage (which will definitely be needed to minimize the other problems listed), then are people are going to be pissed when buzzing drones fly over their homes videotaping their kids in their paddling pools?</p>

<p>6) Many technical problems with current generation drones - they have a high crash rate, limited battery power, and their proximity sensors are generally not sensitive enough to see thin branches and power lines in time to avoid them. (Could be fixed in time with new technology). </p>

<p>7) Drones can be easily <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/could-prime-air-drones-be-hacked-probably-amazon-might-not-2D11691755">hijacked by spoofing signals</a>, using fairly cheap equipment. A hacker could easily take control of a drone, and use it for malicious purposes, including terrorism. - (anonymous Pipe-bomb delivery system anyone?)</p>

<p>8)  Fast deliveries will only be possible to people who live close to an Amazon storage/drone facility that stocks the item they want. Even if they set up hundreds of these facilities, they will still only be able to offer this 30 min service to like 5% of the US landmass. </p>

<p>9) Americans who are concerned about the constant erosion of civil liberties, and being spied on will justifiably <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/innovation-works/this-colorado-man-is-ready-to-hunt-amazon-drones-20131203">shoot down and destroy drones</a> that enter their airspace. </p>

<p>10) A single drone currently costs more to produce and maintain than a delivery van - at least for the foreseeable future. Taking into account drone losses from causes listed previously,  it is obvious that large scale delivery drone systems would be a huge financial disaster. </p>

<p>So, are we meant to believe that Amazon didn&#39;t consider these problems? </p>

<p>Or is there a more sinister reason for pushing this pro-drone propaganda? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the recent <a href="http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/240163382/amazon-wins-600-million-cia-cloud-deal-as-ibm-withdraws-protest.htm">600 million dollar Amazon-CIA contract has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with it</a>, right guys? /s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Drones might currently be associated with military use, but that won&#39;t be the case for long. Sure, the FAA hasn&#39;t approved the use of the unmanned aerial vehicles yet and that likely won&#39;t happen until 2015 or after, but Amazon is just one of many companies and organizations beginning to think about using the pilotless-aircrafts in different ways. Welcome to the future.</em>&quot; - <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/amazon-prime-air-ways-drones-future/story?id=21070635">Quote from an ABC news article</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is OBVIOUS that this is not a new &quot;technological paradigm&quot;, as many are claiming, but a carefully constructed PR campaign aimed at changing public opinion towards being more accepting of spy drones in the USA, strategically released the night before the biggest day in E-Commerce - &quot;Cyber Monday&quot;, to also take advantage of millions of dollars in free advertising.</p>

<p>Edit: If you&#39;re downvoting this post, please explain why, so I can improve it. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/15jpTQv.jpg">Thanks</a> :), also I admit delivery drones could become a common sight <em>eventually</em>, just not in 5-15 years like Amazon Air claims. </p>

<p>Edit: the propeganda machine loves to trivialize things that would normally be of real concern or under real scrutiny. They do this will the media as a whole. Conspiracy ideas becoming to popular? Let&#39;s turn the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; into a joke so that any time anyone ever brings up a real conspiratorial concern it becomes a joke, nothing to be taken seriously.

    <div class="md"><p>Snowden leaks? Name one thing that wasn&#39;t common knowledge that he has &quot;leaked&quot;. The only reason this shit is still around is a distraction from real shit they are doing.</p>

<p>Everything he has said or &quot;leaked&quot; so far is stuff we already knew we don&#39;t need proof of any of this shit it has been happening since the telephone and communication has been around.</p>

<p>The whole Snowden thing is horseshit cause if it was real and he did have real info that would just fuck up the rotation of the world he would have released it by now. That is the nature of things the media just picked it up cause the masses were gonna talk about it.</p>

<p>In reality if they didn&#39;t know then they deserve to have boots kick in their door for ignorance to the world that is around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>According to the FAA roadmap for drones, unmanned aerial aircraft will not have access to the US airspace until 2020. Amazon’s case is complicated by the fact that it will require licenses to operate flights that are beyond visual line of sight or beyond a range that is 400 feet high and 1500 feet laterally. This restriction means that unless you live very close to the Amazon fulfillment center, the chances of getting that package shipped to you are non-existent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;ve more excited for Amazon US Postal Service Sunday delivery. 
I&#39;ve been saying for years now that if the USPS wants to get out of the red, they need to do something no other carrier already does better than them. Expanding to Sunday delivery is that answer. Neither Fedex or UPS does Sunday delivery, so no matter how limited the service USPS offers, they&#39;ll have 100% market share. 
I&#39;d imagine that both UPS/Fedex are already gearing up for sunday delivery to compete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The post office is only struggling <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/02/07/how-healthcare-expenses-cost-us-saturday-postal-delivery/">because Congress has forced them to pay pensions in advance</a>. No other government agency has to do this and as a result it is in the red. Otherwise it would probably be profitable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2006, the Post Office has been legally required to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees at a cost of around $5.5 billion a year. For the first time last year, it defaulted on its annual payment.</p>

<p>So far the Post Office has placed about $44 billion in that pre-retiree account. Without the mandate, the Post Office’s financials — while still not completely healthy — would be much more stable.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s funny, because I disagree with Bezos&#39;s position on drones -- I think there&#39;s lots of privacy-related issues that I think require careful thought and planning beforehand, but nonetheless, I think Amazon&#39;s position is clear -- and it&#39;s going to be sooner, not later, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drones are one of the issues that I really have trouble coming to terms with. Here&#39;s my take on some points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The drone program was an obvious PR move, the logistics of it is simply ridiculous on large scales.</li>
<li>That said, short-distance drops are quite possible. This would mostly be for urban deliveries and/or using a van as a mobile base station.</li>
<li>The drones would likely record video 24/7 and anyone who attempts to tamper with one will get a call from the friendly Amazon Legal Team.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it going to happen? Probably not. Is it possible? In limited circumstances, yes.</p>

<p>Drones seem like something that could be incredibly useful to average people - we just need to wrench them out of the hands of the government and corporations first.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This solves a lot of problems in regard to implementation of this. </p>

<p>Actually it would make sense - in my hood, for instance, we have about 10K homes spread out over 10 miles of woods. It is a huge pain in the ass for delivery services. </p>

<p>If however a single large van could pull up and release short-jump drones from the base of our main drag, it could do a day or two of delivery in less than an hour while monitoring the drones from the van. </p>

<p>That being said I still agree with everything OP said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The van as a base station also allows some of the nimbler short-range drones to be used, like a quadrotor copter.</p>

<p>Many packages Amazon delivers are too heavy and/or too large to be carried by drone - especially over long distances. Shipping anything larger or heavier than an SD card via drone would be unreasonably expensive, and would require something large and fixed-wing like a Predator drone to deliver, which is obviously impossible.</p>

<p>A quadrotor copter would be able to deliver light packages, but typically these drone types are very light, can carry little weight, and have flying times of less than 15 minutes(to save on battery weight).</p>

<p>Using a van as a base station would allow a quadrotor copter to deliver light packages and return to the van for charging and for the operator to add the next package. Even better, it would charge off the alternator in the van and so the only operating cost would be gasoline.</p>

<p>For OP&#39;s bullet point about persons who object to drones flying overhead: making short jumps from a mobile van station would keep the drone&#39;s airtime low and would probably spend most of its time flying from the road to someone&#39;s door and back. Nobody but the person who ordered Amazon Air would be flown over, and no privacy would be violated that wouldn&#39;t be equally threatened by a cameraman on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>For OP&#39;s bullet point about drones being shot down and/or attacked by pets: having a driver and a van nearby would help cut down on legal liability by adding a witness and a common-sense check that &quot;Hmm, maybe the guy with four NO TRESPASSING signs on his lawn would rather I just leave his package at the mailbox.&quot;</p>

<p>Chances are also good that Amazon Air would have some legal disclaimer which holds the property owner responsible when their cat tries to &quot;kill&quot; the drone and damages it - those things aren&#39;t cheap!</p>

<p>OP&#39;s bullet point about drones being hacked: a driver would also be able to alert authorities within minutes if a drone didn&#39;t return, and a short-range drone with an autonomous charging dock would likely need modification before your average Joe could use it. If Amazon were especially paranoid, they could also include some soft-bricking measures that makes the drone refuse to operate unless it gets an OK signal from the van/driver.</p>

<p>A mobile van station would also allow the computer to remain in the van, cutting down on drone cost and weight. The drone might only have enough brains to fly out, drop off a package, and reattach to the van - all GPS and flight operations could be handled by a computer in the van. Heck, if the van has line-of-sight to the door, you could even use a laser to &quot;paint&quot; the landing zone for the drone.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>I think drones have massive uses for multiple things in society, and drone delivery could be a really cool thing. If it were handled properly.</p>

<p>We are right to fear drones, but that&#39;s because 99% of all drones are military death spies - as the industrial and commercial markets for drones opens up we can expect to see many more of their positive uses.</p>

<p>I predict we will also see the word &quot;drone&quot; apply to many more things than flying robots. Nobody said flight is the best method of travel for all applications!</p>

<ul>
<li>A drone tethers to the top of a building and scoots up and down its line, cleaning windows with zero human risk. Kind of like a big roomba for buildings.</li>
<li>Paranoid types can use drones to deliver microSD cards to each other - I can hardly think of a more secure form of communication, great for exchanging one time pads.</li>
<li>Low-energy drones can provide security for buildings - a helium balloon with a camera on it and just enough servos to keep itself pointed in the right direction. Add solar panels, a wireless connection, and you have a 24/7 eye in the sky!</li>
<li>Routine maintenance and cleaning. Imagine a Roomba the size of a copier that scoots around a large building like a school or hospital, sweeping, vacuuming, buffing the floors, sanitizing surfaces with UV lights, etc. If it could use the elevator, you might only need one for an entire office building!</li>
<li>I haven&#39;t seen one myself, but hospitals already have filing cabinets on wheels that run around, delivering documents to people who need them.</li>
<li>Copter drones have already been mentioned as assists to engineers as they survey large structures - no more running around on ropes and harnesses, just deploy the drone and use a super HD camera in multiple wavelengths to do everything from the safety of the ground.</li>
<li>As an extension of people, something like a nuclear reactor could be specially designed for wheeled robots to access everything. Allow techs to remote-pilot the bots, and you have a nuclear facility with a 0% chance of irradiating anyone!</li>
</ul>

<p>With the current political climate, flying drones are currently licensed only to the military and police. We need to change this. If we leave them only in the hands of the snakes who run those departments, of <em>course</em> they&#39;ll be used for evil.</p>

<p>Drones can be very, very useful to the world. We just need to let them be used that way instead of as flying deathbots.</p>

<li><p>A single drone carries a package to a single location &#39;as the bird flies&#39; and returns. Rinse and repeat. No bathroom breaks, no stop lights, no variating fuel cost, no heath insurance, sick pay...(the benefits of a drone over human are countless.)</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m sure that this was taken into consideration, however, the quad+ drones are very stable and can easily compensate for weather conditions. Limited range? I think they stated that it will be regional within a certain range of the distribution center.</p></li>
<li><p>People rob postal/ups/fedex vans everyday, it&#39;s called theft, it&#39;s illegal and it&#39;s one of the cost of doing business. There is no reason that these drones would need to fly above 500 ft, the lowest a plane is allowed to fly over a residential area is 1000 ft. There is plenty of room in the sky for millions of drones.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m sure the containers will be shock proof and dropped, at the very least. Cats, dogs, and most animals avoid these, I fly RC planes and helicopters and have never, in 25 years had a problem with a animal, well, a hawk once with a glider, but he just hit it once and moved on...</p></li>
<li><p>They will be traveling from point A to point B, automated, I don&#39;t think they will be programmed to lurk above your families pool recording your children. Also, I can view your backyard on google maps right now...there is no such thing as privacy anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>What? Based on what? Check out MIT&#39;s advanced drone rigs...they can already navigate duct works, fly in squad formations, compensate for changing high velocity winds and have been able to for at least 5 years. Battery life isn&#39;t even an issue now days. The commercially available gear allows you to fly for nearly an hour with heavy loads.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone can do this without highjacking some amazon drone. (I would delete 7 all together. it&#39;s silly.)</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that you might have missed the whole point of this amazon automated drone delivery. You do understand that the majority of people in the world live in concentrated proximity, usually refereed to as cities. I&#39;m not certain, but I believe that the entire population of the earth occupies less than 5% of the total land mass, so, this drone thing sounds perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>It sucks, but you do not own the airspace above you. Shooting down an amazon drone would just land you in jail...silly like 7.</p></li>
<li><p>Those amazon drones actual cost is probably $300, but I&#39;m sure the company selling them is charging $10K a pop...which is, at the very least 3 drones to a 1 driver...minus bathroom breaks, stop lights, human error, sick days...etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I guarantee that amazon considered every single thing you&#39;ve brought up and thousands more...I bet they even have a team working on it and lawyers writing legislation to cover their asses.</p>

<p>The only propaganda I see is the associating of this delivery innovation with the military anti-human drones. I believe they are two separate things that can&#39;t really be compared to one another.</p>

<p>Just my two cents while I took a shit. </p>

<p>also, I don&#39;t think the CIA deal for cloud space has anything to do with this delivery system...they don&#39;t need it...they already have access to your phone, home pc, cable box, power meter, multiple satellites that can read your temp. from space...the last thing they need is some shitty chinese made plastic rc quad copter checking out your landscaping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think drones/robots are fucking awesome and totally the future. </p>

<p>There will always be people trying to misuse new technology, but resisting the technology is not the solution. No point in being an ostrich. Resist the people who control everything and use whatever technology is available to fuck people over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We will still need the vans. But for short trips of small packages to areas near their facilities I could see this being a viable option. Cost is high now, as is all new technology, but it will go down. privacy concerns are relevant, but they don&#39;t have to video record. What if they just sent you a text &quot;yo bro, the future is at your door in 2 minutes, cause we got gps and shit&quot;</p>

<p>At the end of the day I see this as less of a conspiracy and more as the free market making something that has evil connotations, a little more cool. Drones do have important uses other than bombing mostly innocents around the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe your right, but I can see it happening by their mark on a small scale of say 5k packages a year. Drones are getting cheaper every day, don&#39;t require health insurance/hourly pay/training, and can work non stop as long as they have an energy source.
Amazon is a company that can afford to be wrong on this one though, because that advertising right before cyber monday was sweet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For 600 million I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a mix of a(n attempted) &quot;new tech paradigm&quot; AND a PR campaign. </p>

<p>With a secret/unlimited budget the ClA needs to keep finding ways to launder money to fund its weapons, operations, etc. The people who would stand to gain from this actually happening are standing around the $600m. Great work,  I just wouldn&#39;t claim it&#39;s only a <em>pr</em> campaign...that money is already at work behind the scenes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh.  Give it some time, pal.  These drones are in their infancy.  Just as it was 10 years ago people would say you&#39;re crazy if you said people would be able to have a pocket size device whereby you could wirelessly order various products and have them delivered to you in 24 hours.  I don&#39;t see anything in your list that can&#39;t be overcome in a few years. </p>
