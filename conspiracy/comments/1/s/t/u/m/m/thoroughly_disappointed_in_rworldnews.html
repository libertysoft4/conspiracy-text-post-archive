    <div class="md"><p>The truth is, any time you&#39;re critical of Israel, or anyone Jewish, you will be called an anti-semite. The reason is because it puts you in a position of self defense, yet there is no way to prove to an irrational accuser that you are innocent. You aren&#39;t being genuinely accused though, its just a distraction. Whoever calls you an anti-semite for being critical of Israel or jewish people is either trolling or doing it intentionally to derail your original point and focus on defending yourself. It is no different than calling someone a pussy or an asshole ...its name calling and one can not argue against it other than by trying hopelessly to prove your point. Do not engage in the banter, state your purpose and if others want to call you names, go about your business and ignore them lest you become engulfed by the beast of misdirection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>QVs advice is really good. But, if, like you said, your pride doesnt allow you to stand by,  the best course of action would then be to know more than your opponents. Knowledge is power and thats more relevant during debate than anything else.</p>

<p>If youve ever seen the movie &quot;thank you for smoking&quot;, theres a quote from it that i really like:</p>

<p>When the son asks his father how he can win an argument even though he knows hes wrong, he replies, &quot;you can never lose an argument, as long as you know how to argue.&quot;</p>

<p>Like i said, just make sure you know more about the topic than your opponents, and try and be as civil amd tactful as possible, without resorting to ad hominim attacks and stuff.</p>

<p>Heres my comment editted:</p>

<p>&quot;By posting those comments in THIS sub instead ;-))</p>

<p>Hope that clears it up, i wasnt trying to be a dick. </p>

<p>It would help, though, if you gaves us details about your comments, or a link to the post or something. Otherwise we can only offer generalized tips in conversational tact. Such as offering sources and evidence to support your claims, admitting that the opposing views hold merit but you are skeptical because (enter supported reason here). </p>

<p>If your brave enough you can explain that being antisemetic and being anti jewish are not the same thing, as semetic refers to a type of language in a geographical region in western asia, of which is hebrew, arabic, akkadian, maltese, and other languages. So, to be antisemitic youd have to be anti-all those groups of people.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, to he antizionist is not the same as to be anti-jewish. Zionism describes a movement, while jewish describes a religion. Id recommend research into these terms, as well as research the ashkenazi jews, if you havent already..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha i dont know man. I feel you couldve definately conducted yourself in a more polite manner. Im not saying you were wrong about what you said, as i personally havent logged the necessary hrs of research into those specific topics on israel. So ill just leave it at that. </p>

<p>But more tact wouldve helped you out a lot i think. The other guy needed to be more tactful as well. It seems the both of you actually have done a bit of research on it, but neither really seem to know all there is about it. Sorry if im being overly critical here.</p>

<p>as for your original comment though, i have to agree. Israel definately likes to bolster war-talk with threats everytime iran sneezes. I also particularily like how you tried to explain to the other guy that you arent anti-jewish, just against israels policies. That is an important point to keep note, something which the other guy failed to see and still immediately called you a nazi... With ease i might add. </p>
