    <div class="md"><p>Notice that people are shadow banned making comments here.</p>

<p>This whole sub was collectively punished because one person made a totally reasonable comment about his trip to Israel.  He simply described the racism he encountered against Arabs and the difference between the quality of life in Israel and the occupied territories.  It was a totally reasonable post evidenced by the fact bestof users promoted to the top post!</p>

<p>As was explained to the guy that submitted it, when he went to subredditdrama to defend himself (conspiratard trolls hang out there and were attacking him), his post was deleted because it was deemed &quot;racist&quot; (funny trick, turning his post decrying racism around and alleging it was racist itself).  They further alleged that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was racist and therefore deserved to be collectively punished and banned from bestof (just like the Palestinians are collectively punished).</p>

<p>I tried defending OP and this sub at subredditdrama and BipolarBear, a very active moderator of such subs as <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/SyrianCivilWar">/r/SyrianCivilWar</a> and a known shill and troll, tried &quot;proving&quot; this sub&#39;s racism by citing examples of posts here showing caricatures of Jews that he himself posted!!  Therefore he is planting evidence here to claim &quot;racism&quot; (they are very adamant that anti Jewish bias is &quot;racist&quot;) and he is also falsely equating criticism of Israel with &quot;racism.&quot;</p>

<p>BipolarBear has also taken the step of reading comments here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and proactively banning them from <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> for alleged anti semitism (and making false accusations of course, e.g. Amos_Quitos).</p>

<p>Other conspiratard trolls have infested this sub and are harrassing users like me here and promising me that if I leave this sub I will be harrassed even more.  My one foray into subredditdrama led to hundreds of down votes (as it did for OP who was trying to defend his post about Israel).</p>

<p>That user had his account deleted and we&#39;ve never heard from him again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect the user had his account deleted by the admins.  I think they probably justified this by claiming OP broke the rules--after he had his bestof post censored he then altered his previous top bestof submission which was the most popular bestof submission of all time (they guy could write well)!!  He edited his most popular post of all time to include the Israel post.  Then he went to many different places to expose the censorship he was going through (like this sub and subredditdrama, etc.) and was probably accused of &quot;attacking&quot; the mods and breaking the rules, etc.</p>

<p>You quickly saw conspiratard trolls claiming he deleted the account himself but it doesn&#39;t seem likely to me because he was so riled up by this censorship and was committed to exposing it.</p>

<p>He actually PM&#39;ed me to thank me for supporting him in the subredditdrama post because it was like me and him against dozens of conspiratard trolls.  And Ghost of Dusty showed up and informed me about BipolarBear&#39;s history which I knew nothing about--since BipolarBear was arguing with me--but Ghost of Dusty had his comments deleted I think.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I guess anything&#39;s possible.  Maybe you&#39;re right and &quot;they&quot; wanted to create this shitstorm as ritual humiliation for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  To show how weak and little power we have here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it is ritualistic(I think that idea comes from controled oposition) and more.tactical. After the boston bombing and sandy hook we got a lot more people to the conspiracy comunity as a whole, ad in the snowden shit and there has been a huge increase. So there has also been a big push of stupid stories (paul walker) to discredit us and turn away or bring into the controled oposition the new members. I&#39;ve seen them do this over and over again through the years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an overlap between ritualistic and tactical humiliation; a ritual has tactical effects.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying that people proposing Sandy Hook or Boston Bombing hoax/Psy Op theories are controlled opposition then I don&#39;t agree with you.</p>

<p>I also see you&#39;re into debunking people that evaluate symbolism in music and I don&#39;t think that is warranted.  I too don&#39;t know what to think of symbolism but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s appropriate to mock these posts or call them controlled opposition.  It&#39;s a valid inquiry and the use of symbols has been used throughout human history.</p>

<p>I too think controlled opposition is a common tactic but unfortunately the few comments I see you making here make me think you&#39;re not very adept at recognizing it.</p>
