        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>December 16th, 2013</strong></p>

<p>Now for the sake of discussion, I just want to list the oddities with this date, on this year.</p>

<p><strong>Number one</strong></p>

<p>It all started 4 years ago, <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message948708/pg1">with a little thread on GLP</a>. The mayan calendar does not end on 2012, it ends on 2013. </p>

<p>The math behind this is <strong>sound</strong>. It&#39;s not speculation. The full completion of 13 ahau does NOT HAPPEN until there is another spin of the internal tzolkein, 360 days after the beginning of the baktun. This is the real &#39;end&#39; of the mayan long count. Just like the newyear actually did not being 1/1/00, it actually started 1/1/01. We don&#39;t have a year zero. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2091882/pg1">Mayan Calendar explanation and ISON correlation. This is very convincing, at least about the true ending of the long count</a></strong></p>

<p>Weird. Very strange. Especially because in retrospect, looking at the math and the dates, it&#39;s very obvious. 12/21/12 was hyped extremely, and it dud&#39;d.</p>

<p><strong>Number two</strong></p>

<p>ISON the &#39;comet of the century&#39; in which NASA (purposefully?) displayed this <a href="http://blog.world-mysteries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ison_3b.jpg">comet as a winged V</a> in early hubble images.  It&#39;s never happened with any other comets, so even if it&#39;s &#39;parallax&#39; it was intentionally used and shown that way. </p>

<p><a href="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/aH4Z26ABhbY/maxresdefault.jpg">ISON is going to form a perfect &#39;capstone&#39; for an Earth - Venus ^ ISON alignment</a>, on 12/16/13. Signs in the heavens. Oh, and it regained it&#39;s winged V shape after perihelion.</p>

<p><strong>Number three.</strong></p>

<p>Nelson Mandela- there are many claims that he had died earlier in the year. There is a ceremony in which 91 world leaders will be in South Africa for a 10 day funeral service. </p>

<p>Part of it will take place at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voortrekker_Monument#Architectural_purpose">Voortrekker Monument</a> in which the architecture shines a sun beam directly onto a gemstone containing 32 sun rays, making it 33- on <strong>12/16</strong>. It was inspired by Egyptian architecture. <strong>Mandela&#39;s grave will be draped with a leopard skin, remember this</strong></p>

<p>The moon will be in it&#39;s gate on 12/16, and the sun will also be in it&#39;s gate on 12/16.</p>

<p><strong>Number four, the double whammy</strong></p>

<p>Remember Denver International Airport and the New World Airport commission? Remember this mural? <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/sm/custom/q/d/c00b7fb1df.jpg">The one with a leopard coffin, quetzecoatl depicted as the Pheonix rising, and a meteor/comet impact?</a></p>

<p>This mural is literally a <a href="http://diaconspiracyfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/denver-8.jpg">freemason mural</a> depicting the return of quetzecoatl, and meteor/comet strike. The pheonix is stripped of it&#39;s mysticism and displayed in a scientific way- just like ISON is being depicted in the MSM. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we have a true end date of 12/16/13 via the Mayan calendar. We have the sun in it&#39;s golden gate, and the moon in it&#39;s silver gate. We have ISON winged comet of the century (which resurrected after perihelion, <em>pheonix</em> style) completing a pyramid in the heavens as ISON as the capstone. We have Nelson Mandela&#39;s 10 day funeral session ending on 12/16, at an Egyptian inspired sun monument- in which he will be draped with a Leopard skin on his coffin (see mural). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can we speak of chance?

    <div class="md"><p>In mathematics, addition and subtraction include &quot;zero&quot; as an integer. &quot;-5 + 5 = 0.&quot; This is because modern mathematics has evolved over the past few millenia to acknowledge 0 as existing.</p>

<p>The Julian calendar, which originated with the Romans/Catholic Church, was fabricated in a culture where there was no such thing as zero (oddly enough, Europe didn&#39;t really use zero until the time of the Renaissance or so, see addendum).</p>

<p>This wouldn&#39;t be a problem, except for the fact that the Julian calendar isn&#39;t all positive - it has pseudo-negative numbers because of all the time that existed before the Birth of Christ. With Christ as the origin of our timeline, but with no &quot;Year 0,&quot; when was Jesus born? Well, &quot;Year 1,&quot; obviously.</p>

<p>But wait. A century is 100 years, right? That means, if Year 1 is our origin, that a century only starts one hundred years after January 1st, 1 AD - January 1st, 101 AD. This is the <em>technical</em> reality of the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>But, because we&#39;re a modern culture that knows about 0 and think that a century should go from 0-&gt;99 instead of 1-&gt;100, we just move the goalposts to meet our paradigm. The 1st Century AD, as a result, technically is only 99 years long (1-99), as is the 1st Century BC.</p>

<hr/>

<p>But, as an interesting side question, <em>why</em> did the Catholic Church not like zero? Well, it goes back to the Greeks, namely Plato, whose dualistic philosophy happened to match up with what the Christians believed and was thus integrated (despite it being flawed in many ways that modern evangelicals are just starting to work out). Because Plato&#39;s belief about a &quot;dirty, corrupt physical world&quot; and a &quot;perfect, ideal spiritual world&quot; (Plato&#39;s Cave) were analogous to Christian beliefs about heaven, his teachings were held with similar regard to canon scripture.</p>

<p>And Plato <em>hated</em> zero.</p>

<p>The Greeks never really <em>got</em> zero, nor did they comprehend infinity. Their mathematics, viewed with the lens of modern hindsight, was crushingly restrictive due to assumptions they made about how numbers worked - in particular, their lack of abstraction of number theory. Greeks didn&#39;t really see numbers as <em>numbers,</em> per se, they just viewed numbers as representations of physical constructs of geometry (whereas we might say that a measurement defines an object&#39;s size, the Greeks would say that the object&#39;s size defines the measurement). They didn&#39;t believe in anything except for the set of Counting Numbers {1, 2, 3, 4 ...}; anything that wasn&#39;t a whole number was merely a ratio of two &quot;real&quot; numbers.</p>

<p>Now, as you can imagine, the fact that Greeks only believed in (yes, &quot;believed in,&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism">mathematics was akin to religion</a> and several people were executed for &quot;mathematical heresy,&quot; namely in regards to zero) counting numbers and ratios, they had a bit of trouble once they stumbled upon more... complex systems. Pythagoras, for example, had trouble with his oh-so-famous theorem because it irreconcilably introduced irrational numbers into his paradigm - a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> is <em>proven</em> to be true, but what does that mean when c<sup>2</sup> = 5? The square root of 5 can&#39;t be written as a ratio, that means it can&#39;t possibly exist! But the theorem worked, and it was useful, so the Greeks &quot;ignored&quot; the fact that it conflicted with their mathematical religions.</p>

<p>Then come along some traders from India who, after selling off their goods, mark their inventories as 0. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; a few curious Greeks ask. &quot;It&#39;s a number that represents nothing - we have no turnips, so we have zero. We sorta nicked it off of the Babylonians a while back.&quot; Now, the mathematicians get all pissy at this and call it heresy, but the traders and businessmen of the ancient world being adopting a sort of pseudo-zero because, hey, they&#39;re not crazy religious nuts.</p>

<p>But now bring in the Catholic Church and the Dark Ages - that time in history in which only the religious caste were educated, because the nobility was busy plotting for power and the peasants were busy being oppressed (help, help!). Zero lays low for a while, mainly staying as a sort of placeholder value for &quot;I have no turnips,&quot; because anyone who investigates the concept of zero is branded a heretic by the church - they&#39;re challenging <em>Plato,</em> that great philosopher of that paradise that existed before Europe became a hellhole and whose interpretation of reality forms the backbone for our epistemology!</p>

<p>And so the Catholic intelligentsia didn&#39;t learn about zero until the wars of religion caused a breakup of doctrinal hegemony, at which point we see guys like Isaac Newton and Lebinitz looking at old Milanese trading records and thinking &quot;Hey, this number is pretty weird!&quot; And going on to derive Calculus from it. Yes, they derived Calculus from zero - or at least they developed it while attempting to <em>understand</em> zero (in fact it&#39;s Lebinitz&#39;s realization of the link between zero and infinity that give his notation precedence in modern mathematics, because Newton was a pussy who didn&#39;t challenge the status quo and just called integration steps &quot;so small they&#39;re <em>practically</em> zero,&quot; which is cheating).</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: Plato hated zero because the Greeks were math zealots and didn&#39;t believe in it, Catholics liked Plato because Dualism matched their interpretation of the afterlife, ergo Catholics hate Plato and the knowledge of zero is repressed for 1,500 years and our calendar is FUCKED TO HELL BECAUSE OF IT.</strong></p>

<p>(Most of this information comes from various historical/theological/mathematical studies but is <em>very</em> well summarized in &quot;Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea,&quot; which details the history and the implications of zero/infinity. Great read if you&#39;re looking for a book)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially, zero came into play when mathematicians were trying to figure out derivatives. The slope of a function is important for a lot of reasons in mathematics, and has a lot of applications in pretty much any science that uses math - physics, economics, anything. The problem is, getting the slope of a line is nigh impossible to do, since a curve is, well, <em>curved.</em></p>

<p>You can get the <em>average</em> slope (or &quot;rate of change&quot;) by taking the slope of a line between two points on the curve, but this only gives you an approximation that is either under or overvaluing the slope at point x.</p>

<p>You can narrow down the margin of error by taking the slope between two points <em>really</em> close to x, but you couldn&#39;t take the slope of &quot;x&quot; because you&#39;d have to divide by zero, since the slope of a line is defined as </p>

<pre><code>[f(x+n)-f(x)]/[(x+n)-(x)]
or, simplified
[f(x+n)-(f)x/]/n
</code></pre>

<p>Now, mathematicians already <em>knew,</em> at this point, that zero existed and tended to fuck with their beautiful formulas by being a freak of numerology, and likewise knew that you couldn&#39;t find the slope of a curve at a single point because dividing by zero would mess up your calculations.</p>

<p>Newton and Leibniz, almost simultaneously in two different countries, figured out a solution - the key is <em>precisely</em> to divide by zero, but do it in such a way as to <em>not</em> divide by zero.</p>

<p>Now, Newton was stuck inside the box and simply expounded on the current theory of the time, merely giving it notation and justification. Essentially, he said that &quot;as n gets <em>really, really</em> small, it&#39;s essentially zero.&quot; In other words, once you made n small enough, the function was no longer an approximation. As I said, Newton was a pussy who didn&#39;t challenge the social order on this one.</p>

<p>Leibniz, though, realized that you couldn&#39;t just settle for &quot;close enough,&quot; you needed zero - or something so <em>infinitely</em> small that it was indistinguishable from zero. In this, he realized that <em>infinity</em> was the key to unlocking zero - the two polar opposites were linked intrinsically. Leibniz&#39;s notation, which provides the basis for limit theory, holds that as n <em>approaches</em> zero to be infinitely small, you get an approximation that is <em>literally</em> so infinitely small that it is equal to what you&#39;d get if you had divided by zero.</p>

<p>Essentially, Newton said &quot;n = something <em>reeaaaalllly</em> small.&quot; Leibniz said &quot;x - x + 1 * 10<sup>-inf.&quot;</sup> He <em>defined</em> what &quot;small enough to not matter&quot; was as being <em>infinitely</em> small, and doing so made his version of calculus notation logically sound. That&#39;s why, to this day, mathematicians use Leibniz notation for limit calculations and derivative proofs - because <em>his works.</em></p>

<p>&quot;Delta y&quot; or &quot;dy?&quot; That&#39;s Leibniz - the little triangle, delta, was his symbol for the slope formula above - where the numerator was notated as &quot;The Change in Y - Delta Y&quot; and the denominator is notated is &quot;The Change in X - Delta X.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, the reason that Newton is credited as the inventory of Calculus is... well, he won the PR contest. Both Leibniz and Newton independently published their systems of calculus, but the timing is weird. Newton <em>wrote</em> his first, but didn&#39;t publish until <em>20 years</em> after Leibniz had published his work. Despite this, he and his cronies managed to wage an offensive PR war (&quot;Plagiarism!&quot;). Furthermore, Voltaire (yes, the philosopher) did considerable damage to Leibniz&#39;s reputation with <em>Candide,</em> which was a critique of the Leibniz&#39;s fairly optimistic metaphysical model (&quot;We live in the best of all possible universes&quot;). Leibniz died discredited, Newton was buried with a state funeral.</p>

<p>And yet, for all the glory Newton won with his PR war, nobody gives a shit about his broken-ass calculus system: everyone uses Leibniz, the system that <em>works.</em> History vindicates the loser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, Newtons other accomplishments are 100% legit, and both he and Leibniz were egged into fighting by their groupies.</p>

<p>Also interesting thing about zero - y&#39;know how medieval art appears flat and 2D until the time of the Renaissance? Guess why - yep. Zero. The concept of a 3 dimensional picture with objects being slanted towards a central, infinitely distant point on the horizon only appeared because zero and infinity started making a comeback.</p>

<p>As I said, the book &quot;Zero: the biography of a dangerous number&quot; details this more completely and, for the material it&#39;s covering, is surprisingly easy to read.</p>

<p>It should seriously have you convinced, the math is sound.

<p>The oct 2011 date that was also hyped is along the same lines, namely a full completion of the inner tzolkein. But seriously, read the glp thread. </p>
