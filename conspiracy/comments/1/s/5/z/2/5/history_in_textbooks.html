<p>I went to New Albany High School, it was a Blue Ribbon Award school a few years. I would def say it was a little more advanced than other public schools in my city based off meeting other kids during college from around my city, and what they learned or knew. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s only a few accounts on here that do this. There is this account, some other one with like 6 numbers, and one more I believe. If you look through their history, it is nothing but &quot;no, no, no, no.&quot; There is no reason for these people to be on this subreddit, just like there is no reason for me to go on r/NFL and say &quot;football is retarded&quot; to anyone who says &quot;anyone going to the game this weekend?&quot;</p>

<p>I personally believe that these people have a psychological problem where they have to have contrary opinions to anything, even if they are contradictory from day to day. It is extremely annoying because you have to constantly correct them (see the fluoride thread I am referring to) and they just don&#39;t stop. Otherwise, other people who may not have extensive knowledge on whatever topic we are discussing would get the impression that there is some kind of legitimate debate going on, when it is just a couple of contrarians who have psychological problems instead. </p>

<p>The history is not made up, but it is stifled, twisted, spun and summarized to push the propaganda to you.</p>

<p>For instance, people get on their hands and knees when talking about abraham lincoln, most are unaware he was depressed and suicidal and had to be kept from his own guns. while most praise him over the issue of slavery they are unaware that he didnt care about them and that he brought america back to the same system of governance we tried to avoid and fought a revolution over, 60 years prior.</p>

<p>You wont be taught about Iran contra, how Rumsfeld said trillions was missing from the pentagon the day prior to 9/11, or how the CIA causes all sorts of blackops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My father was a History teacher for Baltimore County Public Schools for 30 years (retired &#39;07).  He told me at the time of his retirement, the school district was making moves to begin teaching American history from the post Revolutionary War era to the present. Completely skipping a couple hundred years worth of early settler history, the formation of the 13 Colonies and all the battles that took place against Great Britain which formed this great country of ours. That&#39;s a pretty important period to skip in my opinion because kids won&#39;t understand the hows and whys of our country&#39;s beginnings. </p>

<p>Anyone here from a B&#39;more county public school? It&#39;d be nice if someone else could confirm if they ever went ahead with this or not.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of good answers here. </p>

<p>Consider also that historians are just people and have limited access to information. Often they don&#39;t have direct knowledge of their subjects, but must rely on whatever primary and secondary sources they can find. </p>

<p>Some thing we consider to be facts about the Roman Empire, for example, come from only one or two sources written decades after the events. In some cases they mention the topic only briefly because other more complete documents existed at the time; but unfortunately those more detailed accounts have since been destroyed. </p>

<p>Even a historian working today writing a large volume on a current topic, such as the Obama administration, would almost inevitably be criticized from many directions for missing one fact or another, or for various forms of bias. Now boil that work down to a chapter or maybe a few paragraphs in a history textbook, and omissions and distortions become pretty much unavoidable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Majority of it is accurate. Not all. It depends on what your local board of education deems as acceptable. In my day which was the 60&#39;s it was taught only Columbus was the first explorer to reach the USA. Then my son had in his book the Vikings, After studying Polynesian history and Asian. Now it&#39;s known that Polynesians landed in South America before Vikings and Jomon people from Japan landed 2000 BCE in Western Chile. Each discovery brings more info. </p>

<p>Your teacher and books only know what they learn at the time of writing. You never know maybe it will be accepted on 9/11 20 years from now on who caused the tower collapse. Just learn your dates, get through your tests for now, play their game, and satisfy they have taught you. Just keep your mind open and free though. Learning is never supposed to end after school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What school and what history books? I get nothing but surprise, shock, and doubt when I talk about any of these things, including people in your age range. Also, when you say &quot;most,&quot; can you point specifically which ones you&#39;re talking about?</p>
