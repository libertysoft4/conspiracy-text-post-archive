<p>That&#39;s all well and good. We don&#39;t care if Shills are actually looking for people that are threatening violence. We care about the shills that try to change the conversation. There are shills that promote the current regime. There are shills acting as government propaganda machines. Am I wrong? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are certainly people in the organization like that(not that I&#39;m completely innocent). However, the simple fact that we&#39;re basically spying on people to get all of our information (whether the intention is good or bad) is immoral in and of itself.  Also, I can tell you right now that in all the years that I&#39;ve worked with them, I&#39;ve never seen us come close to catching any real terrorists.  </p>
