<p>This is a terrible thought. The very idea here is simply promoting the idea that we need to be afraid of everyone, which is the fundamental basis for the increased security over the past decade - be afraid of everyone else and be afraid of being in public because everyone else is bad. Let&#39;s just put security up at all the schools, at all the malls, theaters, and public places because something possibly could go wrong. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not look at the actual reason things do go wrong.</p>

<p>Guess what? Adam Lanza was home-schooled.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marsha, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Crystal Lake, said that Nancy had home-schooled Adam after pulling him out of the Newtown public school system. &quot;She mentioned she wound up home-schooling him because she battled with the school district,&quot; said Marsha.</p>

<p>Yes, public schools are the only thing keeping civility from succumbing to barabarism /s</p>

<p>Guess what? His victims weren&#39;t and maybe if they had been (I neither denounce or endorse homeschooling) the only way Adam could have killed each one of those kids is if he went to each of their houses. no fish in a barrel.</p>

<p>How do you honestly propose that we further society without public schooling? I agree there are numerous faults with public schooling, but there is no way that our society could exist without it. We would not have basic public servants to take out your trash, make your food, run your stores, provide your utilities, and run your government. How do you think we get the fundamental ideologies to run these functions? How can you home-school someone if you haven&#39;t been taught by someone else previously?</p>

<p>Public schools does not encompass all interaction. Equating the two shows me your are not at this point capable of reasonable thought.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying we should overthrow compulsory education not civil society, you probably have an inability to differentiate the two (public schooled by any chance?)</p>

<p>I&#39;m for public schooling, not compulsory public schooling. BIG DIFFERENCE</p>
