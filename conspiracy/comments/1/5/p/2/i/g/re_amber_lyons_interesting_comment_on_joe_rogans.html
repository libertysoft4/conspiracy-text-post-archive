    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s almost precisely the reason why someone would choose Paraguay.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
<li>Cheap abundant agricultural land (although you&#39;ll get offered a lot of space in the Chaco, you probably can&#39;t live there... it&#39;s not for everyone)</li>
<li>Electricity is also cheap and abundant thanks to the Itaipu Falls Hydro Power Plant</li>
<li>Livestock can be had at a great price, and if you like BEEF, Paraguay has got some great cattle prices. Also, there are very few feedlots, so most of the beef you can find is grass fed, and doesn&#39;t come with premium that you pay in North America</li>
<li>Currency exchange in your favour. Sure it&#39;s not as good as it was a few years ago, but it still gives you practically a 4x increase in your purchasing power from with your US or CA dollars. This REALLY helps when you&#39;re constructing a property. This makes building materials cheap, and LABOUR even cheaper.</li>
<li>Football (&quot;Soccer&quot;) is a religion here. For a country of only 6 million people, they&#39;ve been in the last four World Cups, coming from one of the hardest continents on the planet.</li>
<li>Delicious food in the restaurants. Compared to Uruguay, Paraguy is a foodie&#39;s heaven. Plenty of international cuisines, and affordable prices. A full course dinner for two with drinks, dessert and a starter can be had for under $30 (with tax and tip) at a four star restaurant.</li>
<li>Decent health care, with private hospitals that have very good care. You can insure your family for everything for about $80 a month. For a single person, it&#39;s about half that.</li>
<li>Perfect Hub to go and see the rest of South America. Like Pot? Uruguay to the South is just in the process of full legalization. Like more culture? Hola, Argentina! (A return flight to Buenos Aires can be had for under $275). Looking forward to the next World Cup/Summer Games? Brazil is right next door as well, with flights that can be had for under $400. </li>
<li>Beautiful people. Paraguay has amazingly pleasant genes. Don&#39;t believe me? Google Larissa Riquelme... if you go to Paraguay, you&#39;ll see that she&#39;s only an 8 when compared to the rest. And the people are INCREDIBLY nice.</li>
<li>Guavas and mangoes are so abundant, that nobody pays for them in stores. You can practically go for a walk and grab guavas wherever you go.</li>
<li>CLEAN WATER! Asuncion sits on the world&#39;s second largest clean water aquifer. This is KEY. </li>
<li>TL:DR - If shit hits the fan, you&#39;ve now got an energy supply that shouldn&#39;t be disrupted, you&#39;ve got abundant agricultural land, clean water, and beautiful people to make talented soccer babies with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
<li>Not the easiest to get to. When I came down from Canada, it required plenty of transfers, and a pre-arranged Visa to enter. Thankfully, they have Visa-on-Arrival at the airport now in Asuncion.</li>
<li>The country just impeached its president last year, after a scandal involving murdered farmers. This has led the country to be put into the penalty box by its brethren in the Mercosur, which is an economic agreement between Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and now Venezuela. They should get back in at some point, but you never know.</li>
<li>Crime statistics are high, but falling. Also, if you choose not to live near Ciudad el Este, you should be fine. All of my experience in Asuncion has shown me that it&#39;s very easy to stay safe.</li>
<li>Not many English speakers. I&#39;ve heard it pegged at around 95% of the population not being able to speak English. That said, with each year comes more graduates from the American School of Asuncion (ASA), where the students are all taught in English. You can get by on weak Spanish skills, and the people are incredibly nice when it comes to helping you along.</li>
<li>It&#39;s not on the ocean. So, if you want to spend time on the beaches, you&#39;ll either be at a crowded lake, or on vacation in another country.</li>
<li>It&#39;s HOT, HOT, HOT... Get ready to be married to air conditioning, and Lord help you if you can&#39;t afford a pool.</li>
<li>Most things are very cheap, but cars, gasoline, and electronics are not. That said, depending on where you&#39;re coming from, they&#39;re about equal to what you would&#39;ve paid back home.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I weighed these pros/cons, and made the leap. Be cautious of some of the rip-off artists out there offering their services to get you a passport/second citizenship from there. PM me, and I&#39;ll let you know who I used... as I felt I got a really fair deal. </p>

<p>Also, if you end up choosing Paraguay down the road... we have a really cool group of ExPats here that are really supportive of one another. I can get you hooked in with them as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super easy. My guy can get you permanent residency within the first three months (so you don&#39;t have to renew a Visa)... and within 3 years you can be a citizen. Anything earlier than that is very questionable. I&#39;ve heard of &quot;expedited&quot; programs that are like 8-10 months... but they are very grey market, and could be revoked at any time. They&#39;re wicked illegal, and only circumvented with bribes and a monstrous price tag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man that most likely stopped a huge Zionist false-flag nuclear attack from happening at Superbowl 45 by writing &quot;The Nuclear Bible&quot; has applied for permanent political asylum in Switzerland (David Chase Taylor). After he let the cat out of the bag for that event (and the backup event at Times Square on NYE 2011) the government tried many times to take his life.</p>

<p>The Swiss aren&#39;t giving him an easy time of it though, and he is watched 24/7 by CIA interests...most likely for an illegal rendition (though he broke no laws he made the Obama administration look very bad for <em>planning on nuking their own citizens</em>).</p>

<p>I have the opinion Assange also left us a tip about this website/topic in his <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article33396.htm">recent address.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Next year will be equally busy. Wikileaks already has well over a million documents to release. Documents that affect every country in the world. Every country in this world.</p>

<p><strong>And in Australia an unelected Senator will be replaced by one that is elected.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>I thought a possible connection was here because there is a link between what the &quot;positive military&quot; groups are saying (eg Drake) and Truth-Now.net - check out <a href="http://www.truth-now.net/docs/pentagonwants.pdf">The Pentagon wants this info to go viral. [PDF]</a></p>
