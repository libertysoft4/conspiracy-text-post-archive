        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe I am just imagining things here, and I know I am going to sound like the craziest mother fucker right now, but....   </p>

<p>There is a new redditor who is commenting excessively and exclusively on any/every sandy hook post here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>I noticed that he was kinda over the top the way he vigorously opposes every single alternative frame of thought regarding the Shooting. He is even out right combative.</p>

<p>I thought it was weird when I first noticed the frequency of his comments, so I hovered over his name and found out that he has only been a redditor for about 5 weeks.</p>

<p>I clicked his name to review a little bit of his comment history and it kinda just creeped me the fuck out how damn near every single comment was in a sandy hook post here in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>And in every single comment he is actively, I would even say fervently, trying to lead people away from any kind of alternative thought/discussion on the events of that day.</p>

<p>It just creeps me the fuck out. Because he seems to be more informed than average, like almost professional in his reiteration of the official details and his defense of all publicly released information. He seems to be attempting to sabotage, derail and defuse any conversation or dialogue that looks at this from any other angles.</p>

<p>Like this dude is some sort of vigilante here to keep noses from sniffing around or something. </p>

<p>Its just really fucking weird to me.</p>

<p>And I guess the weirdest thing is that this guy has only had his account since last month. (almost exactly 1 month before the shooting).</p>

<p>In that time, He has submitted 4 posts, all of which pertain to the shooting in some form, but not all of them are here on this sub.
The vast majority of his comments have taken place after, and have been all about this shooting. And basically attacking everyone else who has posted about or commented about the shooting.</p>

<p>If you posted some controversial information, or comments, or if you have suggested something mildly skeptical of the public story, chances are that this guy has attacked you too. </p>

<p>I am almost 100% certain that I will be attacked by him just for posting this. </p>

<p>The whole thing is just weird. I looked at this guys comment history, and he has not discussed any other topic in any other sub reddit any where near as extensively as he has been chipping away at this one issue here and now. </p>

<p>The funny thing is, I know how nuts I sound right now.</p>

<p>I have never speculated anything hokey as this, I just wanted to see if anyone else has noticed. </p>

<p>*EDIT: Everyone is telling me that it is not against the rules to post a redditors username so for the record the name of the user I am talking about is: TaylorHicks</p>

<p>And you can tell me if I am right to think this guy is fishy, or you can tell me if I need more sleep....ha ha ha.</p>

<p>Also, I am probably going to delete this post in a day or 2 if it doesn&#39;t get much use, I don&#39;t want to have some embarrassing post like this haunting my account, because its probably just nothing any way, and I will look stupid.</p>

<p>*EDIT: this user has apparently opened up a few alternative accounts today. All with the same MO, most of which have turned very hostile and sent death threats to various users and then deleting the accounts. One of those death threats was sent to me as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a big problem with conspiracy theorizing is the basic approach. In hard science, for example, the idea is to posit a hypothesis, then attack your own hypothesis from the angle of &quot;how can this be untrue&quot;. Then eliminate those counter explanations one by one, where possible. Ultimately you are left either with a counter example that can&#39;t be dismissed, or the truth. Conspiracy theories are usually approached from the other side, or, &quot;how can this be true&quot;. This line of reasoning can only lead to possibilities, not truth. So, all this to say that all theories should be criticized/challenged, especially the most convincing/credible ones. </p>

<p>edit: words mean specific things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are talking about science you are completely using the word theory wrong. In hard science the idea is to posit a <strong>hypothesis</strong>. A <em>theory</em> ,in science, is a hypothesis which has a myriad of supporting evidence. In this <a href="http://sarahsasthmablog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/scientific-method.jpg">diagram</a> of the scientific method, step 10 and 11 is when we would start to consider a hypothesis of <strong>theory</strong> status.</p>

<p>If we are speaking about science the word theory takes on this definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we are talking about conspiracy theories it takes on this definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a proposed explanation whose status is still conjectural and subject to experimentation, in contrast to well-established propositions that are regarded as reporting matters of actual fact. </p>

<p>Go to his house and drag his ass out and leave him at the footsteps of the White House . Let them know that we know</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re confused when you equate &quot;whining about what is wrong with society, [and]not doing anything about it,&quot; with what I initially stated. Your original posts seemed to indicate you wanted to hunt down and, in your words, bring a specific redditor to justice, whatever that means. I think it&#39;s fair to infer that you mean bring to justice in a violent way, but perhaps I&#39;m wrong. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but in any case it just seems petty in the face of important topics discussed in this forum. I think it&#39;s a lot more important to be able to provide rational, thought provoking information, followed by reasonable debates and counter arguments in order to effect some change. To me it would seem like there would be a lot more use in rallying your fellow r/conspiracy friends to organize a protest, a government petition, an information campaign, a volunteering event to benefit one&#39;s community, etc., rather than call for the harm of someone trolling a message board. </p>

I, personally, agree with Malcox X way more than MLK Jr, because Malcom knew his values, he understood what he wanted, and sought to change the world for the better by violently taking back power and giving it to the people. He&#39;s uncompromising with his values, and wasn&#39;t about to compromise his values/political ideas just to be a house negro with a longer leash. Give me liberty or give me death, I shall.never accept anything less.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s romantic and all. It was Dr. King who changed things, though. And eventually even Malcom X, who, remember, was part of a cult which believed white people were created at the beginning of time by an evil black scientist, even <em>admitted</em> his uncompromising, violent approach was <em>wrong</em>. He didn&#39;t take back power at all. He got people talking about him because he was a radical, but nobody listened to him. They listened to Dr. King. </p>

<p>Nearly all of 20th century history says that you&#39;re wrong. Violent, uncompromising action is like, always inferior to compromise. 100% of the time. </p>

This goes on today for African Americans, Mexican-Americans, and just about every race around the world, especially the people&#39;s of other backgrounds that live here in the United States.

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. I don&#39;t know you, dude. But let&#39;s have some real talk for a second. You&#39;ve never hurt anyone. I know it&#39;s silly to try and talk rationally to you, but still. You and I both know that your fantasies of militant action are fantasies and nothing more. Do you know why? Because real revolutionaries who pull shit like this (not that it&#39;s the best way to send a message... At all) are out <em>doing it</em>, not talking about it on the Internet. Go set up a clinic in New Orleans, or some other disaster area, and give out aid when no one else will. That&#39;s what real revolutionaries did/do. </p>

<p>Either do things or talk about things. Both of those are valuable. But never talk about doing things, because you&#39;re wasting your breath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the mods here(a large portion of them have up to +20 by their name for RES).  However, sometimes I feel like they&#39;re not making a lot of effort to ban shills.  I have a feeling that after so many account creations they might give up or at least slow down.  It&#39;s ridiculous seeing a really well made point with two upvotes and twelve or so downvotes in a community of nearly 98,000.  It&#39;s also interesting seeing disinfo about the LIBOR involvement with the shootings upvoted straight to the top even after we&#39;ve proven those connections <em>don&#39;t exist.</em>  Having a plethora of posts about reptilians leading the NWO is one thing, but I&#39;m fairly certain there is a stronger workforce of shills at play than is acknowledged.  </p>

<p>There are people who will say something along the lines of &quot;you&#39;re crazy, you&#39;ve been hitting the pipe too hard, you&#39;re seeing things that aren&#39;t there,&quot; but we know the mentality of the people who make legitimate posts here.  Most of us have seen posts by each other in nearly every thread.  It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to pick out who is purposely trying to spread disinfo(it&#39;s like going to <a href="/r/UFOs">/r/UFOs</a> and seeing &quot;swamp gas, weather balloon, nothing to see here&quot; in <em>every single thread</em>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can personally let you know that the mods here take banning very, very seriously. As of recent, I have been personally messaging users that I see as being generally inappropriate; posting the spitefully sarcastic/hateful put-downs ect. The comments that stir up emotion and generally troll users are not welcome, and those users are messaged(warned) and are banned accordingly. We need everyone&#39;s help to report and message the mods about those kinds of users. Unfortunately, as was mentioned above, many users simply create new accounts, so it is difficult to keep up with it all...</p>

<p>There is a fine line here to show what is inappropriate. Some users are very good at posting comments that attempt to debate and have conversation but will typically just allow arguments to circle until the dialogue is confrontational. I want there to be authentic debates and the sorting out of integral facts from speculation,  but any conversation needs to be conducted with respect and mutual-benefit in mind.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">gentleperson&#39;s guide to forum spy&#39;s</a> is a great resource to get an idea about what tactics are often used to slide the conversation off topic. I see this all the time. Now with that said, any evidence I have of disinfo spreaders is anecdotal, which means that pinpointing users who come here simply to slide discussion are more difficult to nail-down(warn/ban) than one would think. </p>

<p>You guys can help by reporting the worst of the content/comments, making sure to downvote when people are disrespectful(regardless of their position on a topic), and messaging the mods so that we can message/warn the user in question and ban if necessary. As always, remember to conduct yourself with integrity here so that we can all collaborate together in getting at the truth, and grow in the right direction. Cheers! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there were more participation by users in posting thought-provoking, valuable content and publicly condemning the behavior of some users, the mods here wouldn&#39;t need to ban anyone. Think about the voting and the posting behavior of a sub like r/truereddit at its best. The forum acting like a self-regulating organism is ideal; but as it is, the organism doesn&#39;t seem to be aware that it can buck off almost any parasite in the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally wouldn&#39;t think too much of a quick response anymore, simply because of modern technology.  If you have reddit on your smartphone, you can be alerted, just as with an sms or email, as soon as someone posts a reply.  And, if they are unlike me and don&#39;t have to edit and re-edit my post fifteen times before hitting save, they could pump out a reply in no time.  I see the same thing you speak of when i post in even the most mundane of threads.  </p>

<p>Of course, that may not be the case here.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t underestimate the hordes of people with nothing better to do than sit and monitor their account all damn day.  The mentally ill can also exhibit this behavior; especially the ones who don&#39;t have the social skills needed to interact with human beings in any kind of meaningful or respectful way.  They will find ways of getting attention of any kind.  Much like a child being ignored, it doesn&#39;t matter if the attention they receive is good or bad, so long as someone acknowledges them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve commented on these obvious shills too.  I think they&#39;re here for one or both of two reasons: 1) discredit any attempts to bring up the LIBOR connection, and 2) stampede the drive to remove guns from the American public.</p>

<p>There are a few people who are just fanatic and driven about item 1, and too many who are forcing the #2 item. Cars kill more people than guns, but they ignore that and insist the government must ban guns. Thank you, propaganda machine,</p>

<p>In a time when HSBC funnels tons of drug money through and gets off free, and the US tries to dominate the world with wars everywhere, the elite do not want an armed populace demanding reform and resisting being bled dry for the needs of empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the shills descend here, too. Especially the one who is trolling all the discussions pasting his vehement statements there&#39;s no proof. Washington reporters as I&#39;ve said knew there were to be LIBOR hearings and that they were pulled. A troll saying that there there&#39;s no proof is actually not proving anything, if there were scheduled hearings that were then censored. Certainly then there&#39;s no &#39;proof&#39; in the form of a published meeting time.</p>

<p>As for &quot;A lot of people do not own a gun or have any desire to&quot;, that&#39;s fine for them, but you have no right to demand that I cannot own a gun, especially since the Constitution identifies it as a right, In other words, you&#39;re demanding to take away one of my Constitutional rights?

<p>Wrong. There may be no open Internet source for you but that does not mean there is not a source. I&#39;ve said before and not repeat after this, not everything is ripe fruit open on the Internet for  your picking. Some people - idiots - believe that if it is not on the Internet, it doesn&#39;t exist.  Hello, there are whole libraries with material not on the Internet.  You are a fool. </p>

<p>I said before and I repeat, there are plenty of intranets behind firewalls that you cannot read, but it does not mean the information behind them does not exist.  Just that morons like you can&#39;t read it.</p>

<p>Wayne Madsen has a paid subscriber section. I&#39;m not going to post his copyrighted material for you. and violate my service agreement. If you want the data, you go subscribe and go read his discussion of Holmes and Washington. Troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d be pretty funny if there was a disinformation agent posting with a username that seems based on a RL name like TaylorHicks. Almost like it&#39;s so cliche that he couldn&#39;t possibly have any sinister motive or origin (or maybe they did that on purpose, just to throw off people discerning enough to notice the silly name).

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. And that is a very popular opinion in general. And you are certainly entitled to it. I make no judgments.</p>

<p>But this entire sub reddit is used for the purpose of discussing things in a different light. Looking at things from a different perspective. Weighing the information that is either ignored, or forgotten. 
Not every one here believes every single thing in every single post. </p>

<p>A lot of us are here to play with ideas. And see how the available information and the disregarded details and lesser know insights all kinda mesh together to paint entirely different pictures than the ones that are drawn with a bold crayon by those in a position of authority and those in major media.</p>

<p>We all have our &quot;you have got to be fucking kidding me&quot; moments on here. Moments when we cant help but laugh at ourselves and at each other. Trust me, it happens all the time. We are our own most vocal critic. </p>

<p>But sometimes the behavior of people is just very telling. </p>

<p>The behavior and history of this particular redditor was interesting, and out of the norm. It was worth mentioning, to me at least.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t agree, thats fine. I don&#39;t blame you for your skepticism. I applaud it.</p>

<p>But why in the world would anyone come on here and work so feverishly to change the entire nature of an entire subreddit? </p>

<p>This guy is not some self proclaimed benevolent avenger of truth, or conciseness. Trust me, I know what that looks like, I see it all the time. That is something I can understand and abide by.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t sense any true emotion in this guys words either. I sense faux sympathy, used for a purpose.</p>

<p>Attention or they found something they don&#39;t agree with and feel that arguing over the internet will get them somewhere. Those are reasons much more likely than some elaborate conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t sense any true emotion in this guys words either. I sense faux sympathy, used for a purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like the guy who&#39;s sisters friend&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s cousin died when the towers fell on 9/11, People tend to associate themselves anyway they can with infamous tragedies to get attention and sympathy. </p>

<p>I wanted to bitch slap so many people around 9/11 that just had to tell me how they were so much more affected than I, being a person living in the midwest, because of some very distant relationship with a person they most likely never even met. People tend to do that shit for attention and sympathy. </p>

<p>He himself is reinforcing censorship; not cutting it down. This is like Halliburton telling me weapons are bad cause they kill people. He&#39;s the source of the censorship, and then he goes and speaks against it through obscure quotes and faraway languages?</p>

<p>Sounds legit. </p>

<p>Also, most people on reddit don&#39;t speak Chinese. Expecting someone to have skills beyond Google Translate is another oversight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can personally let you know that the mods here take banning very, very seriously. As of recent, I have been personally messaging users that I see as being generally inappropriate; posting the spitefully sarcastic/hateful put-downs ect. The comments that stir up emotion and generally troll users are not welcome, and those users are messaged(warned) and are banned accordingly. We need everyone&#39;s help to report and message the mods about those kinds of users. Unfortunately, as was mentioned above, many users simply create new accounts, so it is difficult to keep up with it all...</p>

<p>There is a fine line here to show what is inappropriate. Some users are very good at posting comments that attempt to debate and have conversation but will typically just allow arguments to circle until the dialogue is confrontational. I want there to be authentic debates and the sorting out of integral facts from speculation,  but any conversation needs to be conducted with respect and mutual-benefit in mind.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">gentleperson&#39;s guide to forum spy&#39;s</a> is a great resource to get an idea about what tactics are often used to slide the conversation off topic. I see this all the time. Now with that said, any evidence I have of disinfo spreaders is anecdotal, which means that pinpointing users who come here simply to slide discussion are more difficult to nail-down(warn/ban) than one would think. </p>

<p>You guys can help by reporting the worst of the content/comments, making sure to downvote when people are disrespectful(regardless of their position on a topic), and messaging the mods so that we can message/warn the user in question and ban if necessary. As always, remember to conduct yourself with integrity here so that we can all collaborate together in getting at the truth, and grow in the right direction. Cheers! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re confused when you equate &quot;whining about what is wrong with society, [and]not doing anything about it,&quot; with what I initially stated. Your original posts seemed to indicate you wanted to hunt down and, in your words, bring a specific redditor to justice, whatever that means. I think it&#39;s fair to infer that you mean bring to justice in a violent way, but perhaps I&#39;m wrong. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but in any case it just seems petty in the face of important topics discussed in this forum. I think it&#39;s a lot more important to be able to provide rational, thought provoking information, followed by reasonable debates and counter arguments in order to effect some change. To me it would seem like there would be a lot more use in rallying your fellow r/conspiracy friends to organize a protest, a government petition, an information campaign, a volunteering event to benefit one&#39;s community, etc., rather than call for the harm of someone trolling a message board. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are talking about science you are completely using the word theory wrong. In hard science the idea is to posit a <strong>hypothesis</strong>. A <em>theory</em> ,in science, is a hypothesis which has a myriad of supporting evidence. In this <a href="http://sarahsasthmablog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/scientific-method.jpg">diagram</a> of the scientific method, step 10 and 11 is when we would start to consider a hypothesis of <strong>theory</strong> status.</p>

<p>If we are speaking about science the word theory takes on this definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we are talking about conspiracy theories it takes on this definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a proposed explanation whose status is still conjectural and subject to experimentation, in contrast to well-established propositions that are regarded as reporting matters of actual fact. </p>
