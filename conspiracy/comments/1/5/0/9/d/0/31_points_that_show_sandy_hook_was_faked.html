<li><p>As yet, we have not seen any concrete evidence that any child died.</p></li>
<li><p>As yet, parents have not been allowed to see their children. (Photoshopped pictures do not count).</p></li>
<li><p>As of now, I have seen only one unambiguous statement from a grieving parent (Robbie Parker).</p></li>
<li><p>According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his older brother&#39;s ID, and it was not stolen. However, older brother Ryan--who officials say is very cooperative--claims not to have even seen his brother since 2010. Where would Adam get this ID? And why does such use not qualify as a theft?</p></li>
<li><p>According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest. Why would he want to hide his identity, and why would he wear a bulletproof vest, if he planned to kill himself?</p></li>
<li><p>The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns--a rifle was found in the trunk of his car. But then he could not possibly have been firing the rifle, and could not have committed the murders. Who did?</p></li>
<li><p>According to the official story, the killing was tightly confined to two classrooms. But then why were so many children told to close their eyes while leaving the building?</p></li>
<li><p>Joanne Didonato, the principal&#39;s secretary, called in sick on Friday--something she rarely does. So presumably, she must have been awfully ill. Yet she then felt well enough to give an interview. &quot;Of all days,&quot; she said, emphasizing the strange coincidence.</p></li>
<li><p>The hospital went into lockdown and cleared four trauma rooms, but received only three patients, two of them dead children (according to the official story) and one mildly wounded adult.</p></li>
<li><p>Why were there such persistent reports that Mrs. Lanza was a kindergarten teacher, and that she died at the school, when the new official story is that she was not connected to the school and was killed at home?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened to the report that Adam Lanza&#39;s girlfriend and another friend were missing in New Jersey?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened to the woodsman in a black jacket and camo pants who was arrested and handcuffed outside the school? He actually shouted to parents, &quot;It wasn&#39;t me.&quot; Who was he and what was he doing there?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened to the dark van or SUV that the police surrounded in the parking lot, or the maroon sedan with a blown-out back window they were on the lookout for?</p></li>
<li><p>The official story is that Nancy Lanza was a gun collector who obeyed the law. But since 20-year-olds are not permitted to buy guns or ammo or carry guns in Connecticut, why would she give her &quot;autistic&quot; son access to both guns and ammo?</p></li>
<li><p>Why were parents told on Friday that &quot;if you haven&#39;t been reunited with your child by now it&#39;s already over&quot;? Does anyone imagine that real parents of real children would simply say, &quot;Okay, the show&#39;s over, let&#39;s go home now&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Would real parents of real children really be satisfied with (possibly photoshopped) pictures of their children? Wouldn&#39;t they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?</p></li>
<li><p>According to the official story, 28 people died but only 1 was wounded. The dead included 20 small, squirmy children--difficult targets even for professionals. How could Adam Lanza achieve such amazingly deadly accuracy, in such a short length of time?</p></li>
<li><p>A child asserts that he/she heard someone say, &quot;Put your hands up,&quot; followed by the reply, &quot;Don&#39;t shoot.&quot; This indicates that the police took a suspect into custody inside the school. But if that was Adam Lanza, how did he kill himself after that point?</p></li>
<li><p>Another child asserts that he/she saw a man pinned down to the ground with handcuffs on. Again, this indicates that the police took a suspect into custody. If that was Adam Lanza, how did he then kill himself?</p></li>
<li><p>When Ryan Lanza was falsely identified as the shooter, who deleted his Facebook profile and created many others in his name?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it reasonable for a geeky 20-year-old to carry two pistols and hundreds of rounds of ammunition while wearing a bulletproof vest and a mask?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the police say on Friday that they were going to leave the bodies rotting in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited the bodies away in the middle of the night? Perhaps to ensure that the transport, if any, would go unrecorded on photos or video?</p></li>
<li><p>Why won&#39;t police tell us where they found the Henry repeating rifle, the Enfield rifle, and the shotgun?</p></li>
<li><p>Did the school have one or more security cameras? What do they show?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did a police officer specifically mention, on radio, that &quot;they&#39;re coming at me through this wood,&quot; followed by a fellow officer saying, &quot;This is it&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>One officer in the school said, &quot;We&#39;ve got one suspect down.&quot; Who was that? Down in this situation generally means in custody (on the ground and cuffed), not dead.</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn&#39;t Adam&#39;s uncle see anything out of the ordinary in Adam 
when the two saw each other in June?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is Adam Lanza reported to be a loner when a teenager said (oxymoronically), &quot;[Lanza and his friends] always gathered alone in a corner in school&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did police assign an individual state trooper to every grieving family, whether the family wants such &quot;protection&quot; or not?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are Ryan Lanza and his roommates still in custody, and why are the police pretending that it&#39;s for their own benefit?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it a coincidence that Nancy Lanza&#39;s brother is Kingston Police Officer James Champion, who lives next door to the former Lanza home?</p></li>

<p>Thoughts? I found this posted on a random Facebook feed.</p>

<p>To all you shitcan twats responding telling me to burn in hell, etc. I didn&#39;t even create this list. Furthermore why would you even be searching on a conspiracy subreddit if you didn&#39;t even want to read this type of shit and possibly be offended?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was bored ... While I am following the story I am not in any way a criminologist/psychologist/or any other -ist and these answers are from my own perspective and very limited knowledge of the events in CT. Please feel free to correct me where I am wrong or add whatever you like.</p>

<ol>
<li> I’d say that since funerals are starting today that yes there is some pretty concrete evidence of dead children.</li>
<li> The process of identifying the dead and presenting the appropriate child for identification from the parents is a painstakingly difficult task.</li>
<li> There have been countless others since this list was created.</li>
<li> He could have easily used his brother’s birth certificate to obtain a driver’s license.</li>
<li> Maybe the suicide was not preplanned… There could be many different reasons for this. He could have wanted to kill as many people as he could and by wearing the vest gave him a few more minutes to kill a few more people.</li>
<li> Reports suggest that he in fact had the Bushmaster nearby when he died.</li>
<li> The principal and a psychologist (I think) were both killed in the hallway. The kids were shielded from seeing this.</li>
<li> Who knows … Some people called in on the morning of 9/11 too. Were they in on the terrorist act?</li>
<li> When reports of a mass shooting like this hospitals are notified to expect incoming wounded. Sadly almost all were dead on the scene.</li>
<li>There are many erroneous reports in the first hours of something like this. The media in their quest to be the first to report something often get it wrong or run with one person’s account of things.</li>
<li>Never heard this one …</li>
<li>I think I heard one report of someone chopping wood in a nearby area. I don’t know much more about that.</li>
<li>Again many reports go out based on something one or a couple people saw and some of those leads do not go anywhere.</li>
<li>I read today that she was preparing for the world to experience and economic meltdown and was a bit of a survivalist. Many people are gun enthusiasts. I enjoy shooting on occasion, and when my daughter is of an appropriate age if she wants to go with me then I and her mother will make the decision on whether to allow her.</li>
<li>With so many dead and without being able to immediately identify them and knowing that all the living children have been reunited with their parents then they should know that their child did not make it. No parent was expected to just say… “Ok. Thanks. Talk to you later.”</li>
<li>Of course they would, but there is also a procedure for identifying the deceased that is to be followed.</li>
<li>It pains me to say, but when cornered in a room the analogy of fish in a barrel comes to mind.</li>
<li>As a precaution any adult in the school would have been stopped and searched before being allowed to continue to do anything.</li>
<li>Were there male teachers at Sandy Hook? Anyone not a student at the school would likely have been detained for the safety of the officers and students. It is not uncommon.</li>
<li>There was another unrelated person who had the same name who deleted their account because they were being falsely accused and threatened because of this horrible crime.</li>
<li>Yes. </li>
<li>Nice imagery there … As an active crime scene and possibly due to the extreme circumstances they estimated the time it would take to photograph and log the entire scene. They were able to get it done faster than anticpated.</li>
<li>The shotgun was found in the suspect’s truck IIRC. The other guns I am not aware of. It has been reported that he had the Bushmaster .223, Glock 10mm, and a Sig Sauer 9mm.</li>
<li>Haven’t heard this reported.</li>
<li>It was reported that a teacher lead some students out the back and into the woods nearby. </li>
<li>Typically down means dead or wounded. </li>
<li>Why didn’t anyone notice anything different the day before Columbine? People have the ability to mask emotion fairly well.</li>
<li>Loners are not part of the ‘in’ crowd. Loners are not as the name implies friendless.</li>
<li>Troopers were assigned as protection to keep prying eyes away from the grieving families. I for one think this was awesome. I wish more departments would follow suit in times like these.</li>
<li>Last I heard they were detained and questioned. I haven’t heard whether or not they are still in custody.</li>
<li>Sounds like a coincidence to me …</li>

<p>The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns--a rifle was found in the trunk of his car. But then he could not possibly have been firing the rifle, and could not have committed the murders. Who did?</p>

<p>Sig makes .223 handguns. Basically short versions of an ar15 that are considered pistols. The rifle found in the car seems to be a high capacity shotgun according to later reports.</p>

<p>Full-Scale Exercises (FSE). A full-scale exercise is a multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional, multi-discipline exercise involving functional (e.g., joint field office, emergency operation centers, etc.) and &quot;boots on the ground&quot; response (e.g., firefighters decontaminating mock victims).</p>

<p>The list below briefly describes the important document types associated with most exercises. The types of documentation described here are all discussed in more detail in HSEEP Volume II: Exercise Planning and Conduct.</p>

<p>A Situation Manual (SitMan) is a participant handbook for discussion-based exercises, particularly TTXs. It provides background information on exercise scope, schedule, and objectives. It also presents the scenario narrative that will drive participant discussions during the exercise.</p>

<p>The Exercise Plan (ExPlan), typically used for operations-based exercises, provides a synopsis of the exercise and is published and distributed to players and observers prior to the start of the exercise. The ExPlan includes the exercise objectives and scope, safety procedures, and logistical considerations such as an exercise schedule. The ExPlan does not contain detailed scenario information.</p>

<p>The Controller and Evaluator (C/E) Handbook supplements the ExPlan for operations-based exercises, containing more detailed information about the exercise scenario and describing exercise controllers&#39; and evaluators&#39; roles and responsibilities. Because the C/E Handbook contains information on the scenario and exercise administration, it is distributed only to those individuals specifically designated as controllers or evaluators.</p>

<p>The Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) is a chronological timeline of expected actions and scripted events (i.e., injects) to be inserted into operations-based exercise play by controllers in order to generate or prompt player activity. It ensures necessary events happen so that all exercise objectives are met.</p>

<p>A Player Handout is a 1-2 page document usually handed out the morning of an exercise which provides a quick reference for exercise players on safety procedures, logistical considerations, exercise schedule, and other key factors and information.</p>

<p>Exercise Evaluation Guides (EEGs) help evaluators collect and interpret relevant exercise observations. EEGs provide evaluators with information on what tasks they should expect to see accomplished during an exercise, space to record observations, and questions to address after the exercise as a first step in the analysis process. In order to assist entities in exercise evaluation, standardized EEGs have been created that reflect capabilities-based planning tools, such as the Target Capabilities List (TCL) and the Universal Task List (UTL). The EEGs are not meant as report cards. Rather, they are intended to guide an evaluator&#39;s observations so that the evaluator focuses on capabilities and tasks relevant to exercise objectives to support development of the After Action Report/Improvement Plan (AAR/IP).</p>

<p>An After Action Report/Improvement Plan (AAR/IP) is the final product of an exercise. The AAR/IP has two components: an AAR, which captures observations and recommendations based on the exercise objectives as associated with the capabilities and tasks and an IP, which identifies specific corrective actions, assigns them to responsible parties, and establishes targets for their completion. The lead evaluator and the exercise planning team draft the AAR and submit it to conference participants prior to an After Action Conference (see below). The draft AAR is distributed to conference participants for review no more than 30 days after exercise conduct. The final AAR/IP is an outcome of the After Action Conference and should be disseminated to participants no more than 60 days after exercise conduct. </p>

<p>I said it from day one a lot of stuff just didn&#39;t make sense. The guns, the amount of bullets, the shooter(s), the family, the mother, the fact that Adam was supposedly great with computers yet he left no internet footprint <em>at all</em>, how he got into the school, the conflicting stories from so called <em>friends of the family</em>. The media just keeps throwing garbage out, making it impossible to figure anything out. I don&#39;t doubt this was a tragedy, or how unbelievably sad it was, but I don&#39;t understand the circumstances surrounding it. I don&#39;t trust the government anyway, not because I am a conspiracy theorist but because I have a brain. </p>

<p>Also, coincidentally here in MI on Friday we made it legal to carry guns into schools and churches. Our district has already put up signs that say GUN FREE ZONE though.  </p>

The colombine killers didn&#39;t wear body armor because of their planned suicide, but if Lanza was trying to be like them, why did he wear body armor. And how did he even get into the school? Something doesn&#39;t seem right about a person wearing body armor without a police badge just walking into school. That is really the only question that bothers me, the rest are basically self explanatory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I just can&#39;t find the reasoning behind why someone would browse a subreddit devoted to conspiracies and asinine ideas and then be offended.&quot; --- The point of the internet?</p>

<p>I said it from day one a lot of stuff just didn&#39;t make sense. The guns, the amount of bullets, the shooter(s), the family, the mother, the fact that Adam was supposedly great with computers yet he left no internet footprint <em>at all</em>, how he got into the school, the conflicting stories from so called <em>friends of the family</em>. The media just keeps throwing garbage out, making it impossible to figure anything out. I don&#39;t doubt this was a tragedy, or how unbelievably sad it was, but I don&#39;t understand the circumstances surrounding it. I don&#39;t trust the government anyway, not because I am a conspiracy theorist but because I have a brain. </p>

<p>Also, coincidentally here in MI on Friday we made it legal to carry guns into schools and churches. Our district has already put up signs that say GUN FREE ZONE though.  </p>
