        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...is that there are so many people who don&#39;t believe the official story, and are doing something to expose the truth. Whether it be the discussion of inconsistencies through media, or the making of youtube videos about a lack of tears. I&#39;ve shared a few videos about the numerous inconsistencies, including the media&#39;s misreports, which of course, people are accepting as genuine reporting mistakes. </p>

<p>The worst ones being that Nancy or Adam Lanza had any association with the school, which they did not. This of course ties into the motive that he killed the children at Sandy Hook because he was jealous of them, because he felt his mother loved them more than him, and he feared that his mother was going to have him committed to a mental facility. Let me remind you, neither Adam, nor Nancy Lanza has any association with the school, even though there was a misreport that Adam had an &quot;altercation&quot; with four members of the staff on December 13th, which hasn&#39;t been mentioned since people started checking the facts. </p>

<p>Ignoring the half-baked motive that a person could act so violently, due to the fear that he was considered a danger to himself and others,   there&#39;s still the question of why he would kill his own mother first, if he she was the reason for him killing anyone in the first place. Even if all reports were true, wouldn&#39;t he want her to live to see what she drove him to? I believe Nancy Lanza could have provided the crucial information as to why Adam would or would not kill those children, but what do you know, she&#39;s dead now... </p>

<p>Whether or not you believe that the Aurora theater shooting and the Sikh temple shooting are related incidents, in that they were operations where witnesses reported multiple gunmen/accomplices and the media claimed them to be &quot;lone wolf/gunman&quot; events, there is one undeniable connection. The increased demand for gun control, and the US economy teetering on the edge of the cliff. I&#39;m not really expecting a civil war, but the more amendments that are broken through supposedly &quot;legal&quot; means, the less of a brow people will raise towards national disobedience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got it.  It&#39;s amazing what kind of videos pop up on youtube when you search for &quot;Sandy Hook&quot;.  Where in the past it may have all been legitimate news stories, the consensus now seems to be one of disbelief of the official story.</p>

<p>It says a lot about the public perception we have of our leaders.  And it probably isn&#39;t a good sign that we keep calling bullshit on their half-assed cover-ups and diversions to unrelated issues such as gun control.</p>

<p>The trend seems to be one of lack of trust in government by the public and occurring simultaneously is the increase in government monitoring, restrictions, and control over its people.</p>

<p>I believe we are undoubtedly reaching a tipping point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think lanza did it and of the story in the media is true.  However,  I think the government jumped at the opportunity to make legislation out of the event. </p>

<p>My biggest question though is why?  The only logical motive I can think of is that lanza had violent thoughts and the psychotropic drugs gave him the energy to act.  Lanza supposedly had aspergers and depression. His mother had took him out of public school during high school, my guess is that he was bullied. This victimization probably messed his mind up, and thus went to therapy and prescribed drugs.  </p>

<p>All of my inforation comes off of the Wikipedia page. Yall can look at their sources.  I believe they are mainly from NBC, CNN, and ABC </p>

<p>When you are a kid, your parents can legally force pills down your throat.  When you are an adult, you can stop that.</p>

<p>Adam Lanza stopped taking his meds at some point.  We are being led to believe that this explains his behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what amendments are being broken? this is just laughably stupid. Your whole perspective is completely fucked and moronic. The only reason you care is because it involves guns and because <em>you</em> believe they will use it to take your guns away. But really - they haven&#39;t yet. They aren&#39;t going to. It&#39;s pretty damn clear that the most that can be done is create more stringent requirements for purchase, raise taxes (ammo isn&#39;t even taxed), and close existing loopholes in the law. </p>

<p>Your perspective on why you should keep guns is laughably moronic - you think it&#39;s going to keep the government from coming and &#39;taking&#39; your guns? Or sending you to a FEMA camp? The only thing you are signing up for is suicide by the police - so excuse me for not jumping on your silly ass bandwagon. </p>

<p>And what does this have to do with gun control? This is no different than what was done at the NYC GOP convention years prior. The issue here are things like &#39;free speech zones&#39;. Completely irrelevant to gun control. </p>

<p>This is at best a rumor related to hurricane katrina and has not been demonstrated to be anything regarding an actual policy of the government during hurricanes. See: every hurricane prior to and post katrina. </p>

<p>What&#39;s new here? You referring to the joke legislation put forth by states like Arizona? Unfortunately - I think most of the gun rights advocates find themselves on the wrong side of this legislation so I don&#39;t see how you think it applies. </p>

<p>Right. Which has what to do with gun control? What is having a gun going to do to stop this? Suicide by police? Not for me.</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m informed of everything you mention and don&#39;t see how it&#39;s one greater plot that with gun control, will seal our fate. If anything the gun control issue is a hilarious sidetrack to distract the gun-toting folks from the fact that they <em>are</em> already living in a police state. Your point that guns are the only thing preventing such a state is nothing but an <em>exclamation</em> of your actual ignorance. </p>
