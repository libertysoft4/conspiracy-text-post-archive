        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d like to hear what r/conspiracy thinks would happen if all of the American governments lies were revealed?  What would happen if some great truth unraveled it all over the course of twenty four hours, if 9/11 and Sandy Hook etc were exposed?</p>

<p>For the critics, humour me with this.  I want to here thoughts about what would happen to society if their government was exposed.</p>

<p>This interests me greatly, as it should everybody.  Would society respond, and how?  Whats a likely outcome?  Would the government retaliate?  How would the world respond?  Give me a timeline if you&#39;ve got one.</p>

<p>Do I have a theory?  Not really actually... a part of me would like to see the events unfold peacefully and justice be brought about swiftly, but I just don&#39;t know how that would work in reality.</p>

<p>Edit; Type-o. Thanks EliteSpud</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If all the lies were released, lets say with a full log of footnotes, videos and other absolute evidence... it would be a huge cultural shock that few would be able to get their head around and others would go ape-shit.</p>

<p>You would have several camps:</p>

<p>1: The deniers and Stockholm Syndrome people. They just would not believe it, or make up lies as to how it was &quot;good for all&quot; They would defend the current power structure to their dying end.</p>

<p>2: The Anarchists. I see them out burning every single government and corporate &quot;object&quot; to the ground. Expect mass riots in large centres. </p>

<p>3: The New Movement (Good). I have to call them that for lack of another word. Since the Government would be invalid and illegal they would be people trying to salvage what they could of a broken system. Think like welfare workers who are still trying to get food stamps to poor, ex-police trying to patrol again etc... it would be small groups at the local level trying to maintain services and the general good of the people on a local and perhaps state level.</p>

<p>4: The New Movement (bad). These would be the people far enough from the shit that would try to hold onto and keep power for themselves. They would be something like upper level government workers who know the system and are trying to gain as much power from it by basically selling their superiors down the river. But they still are only interested in their own powers for control. Think ex-senators, retired Generals etc...</p>

<p>This would actually be the end of a lot of things. There would be separate groups vying for power, trying to get to the top etc... I suppose if one was to really read up on what happened after the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror you would have a clearer understanding of what would probably play out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even when the government gets caught lying or doing bent shit, the media fluffs it over. Weren&#39;t they just caught selling guns to Mexican gangs?! Wasnt the CIA caught selling drugs in the Iran contra affair? 
Didnt bush change the law so Rumsfeld or Cheney (can&#39;t remember now) could stay in charge of the company that made billions of the wars these fucks manufactured?
They don&#39;t even want to know that&#39;s the thing. They are in their bubble, they&#39;re happy. Change doesn&#39;t come. Sam Cooke was wrong. Day they find out Cheney,bush and the other twatbags did 911, theyll spin it, that was then this is now. They&#39;d lose evidence, they would delay trial, until they were all dead. Then say it was a disgrace and nothing like that will happen again. But it will. It&#39;s how it works. It&#39;s the American teaching of democracy. Unfortunately the uk has followed suit. Our overseas activities are equally as bad. When they found out Murdoch had essentially been spinning all the press about the previous fuck up government and eradicating bad press, still no one gave a shit. It&#39;s mental. What do these arseholes actually have to do to make them wake up?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  Let me rephrase my question?</p>

<p>What would happen if the governments lies were revealed - without the complicity of the mass media?  In that, the lie exposed was so great the government loses its control over the media.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m really chasing an answer to is how everything and everyone would respond to an undeniable truth that their government was a ruthless system of lies and manipulator of fact.  Would this encourage society to be less dependent on a governing body and more willing to question information presented as fact?  Beyond the initial response, would this great truth make society a better place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly the most profound, yet depressing, answer so far.  Depressing because I think you&#39;re right.  Judging by the responses so far most of r/conspiracy agrees.  Depressing/frustrating.</p>

<p>So... we&#39;re up against a problem the resists a solution?  No fixing this?  There has to be some positive outlook in this for at least r/conspiracy users, otherwise what&#39;s your motivation?  There needs to be a goal in this for each of us, and I&#39;d expect (hope) its a similar goal right?</p>

<p>I actually have very little idea on how to correct the current thinking in society, nor do I have even a half thought out idea on preventing it from repeating in human history.  Maybe, the answer is out of just reach right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah... that... was, a little dark.  But a good enough analogy.</p>

<p>No hope for society then?</p>

<p>Would there be a contingency plan for the government?  Like a &quot;Government 2.0 - now with extra truth&quot; already in waiting?</p>

<p>While I understand there would be a great deal of apathy in the population, I&#39;m sure somebody would not let this slip by unnoticed and unpunished?</p>

They were manipulated by religion, that got boring in our consumer society, so only the truly dull/ignorant still partake (ill await the down votes for that,lol) and now government manipulate them.

    <div class="md"><p>Well thank you. I really don&#39;t see an end though. The education system in America and the uk is being deliberately dumbed down. So as the generations evolve they will question less and less.  The most obvious example that we are mere slaves to the government is the banking crisis. The banks lobbied(bribed) the governments to be de regulated 
, lost all their money on stupid complicated greedy trading, then told the governments to make the people to pay it off. These banks pay as little tax as possible so why do it? Because the government is owned by the banks. Who owns the banks? A small number of elitist families. Proof if ever you needed it we do not live in a democracy nor even a fair society. Our great grandchildren will be paying back debt that none of us ran up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ideally the top execs and colluders would be arrested, indicted for treason, brought into a court of law and probably executed. Maybe rot in federal prison for the rest of their lives if we don&#39;t want to be animals about it.</p>

<p>Point is this shit needs to come out at some point and it will happen all at once. The age we live is ruled by the Internet, so if one thing leaks it&#39;s leaked around the globe within 24 hours. People will not just forget about it and go back to Netflix, I sincerely hope police officers will do something with their jobs instead of arresting protesters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a truly open system of governance would be the solution. Where federal employees work for us, everything they do is openly cataloged and archived on the Internet. </p>

<p>We should be able to log into the White House website and see specifically where each piece of the budget is being spent. Down to the very last cent. Also what their plans are, why are these people meeting in private? we fucking hire them to work for us. we should know everything they&#39;re trying to do at this point going forward. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the solution - a real truly open system of governance. Not this baloney &quot;open transparent&quot; shit that barry bounel has been preaching for 2 terms now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES!  Finally, an answer!  Thank you.</p>

<p>I like this answer.  How would &quot;non-compliance&quot; from our government be dealt with?  Would the government be stripped of its link to the military and/or police?  How does the media fair from its actions of the past?  What would happen to systems like the financial market and educations system fair also?</p>

<p>Sorry, if these questions seem a little naive.  Probably opening a can of worms, but its good to see a constructive response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still feel we need to deal with non-compliance in the same fashion. Higher execs in the media, education, and definitely within high-finance need to be executed. Liars will never change. We cannot trust a single word they say, so what value do they offer society at this point? Why should we(taxpayers) feed them and house them in a prison? Murder them and let that be their punishment for everything that has been done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they would be released to threads like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so that no one would take them seriously. And then they would have a Cointelpro to make sure that anyone who gained traction with the story could easily be discredited, its SOP as far as i have seen over the last 2 decades.  But recently, any dissenting opinion has looked like it is being out right deleted from the Zeitgeist by the mainstream gatekeepers.  I wonder if it is the decision of Facebook to start to delete ghandi quotes, or if it is a task being delegated to them by a higher power.  I can&#39;t imagine any government official having any power over a multibillion dollar corp, however, I can imagine a banking tycoon telling Ol Zuck to get with the program or they will bankrupt them.  hey thats just my take on it though. </p>

I could only hope that we would attempt to redeem ourselves by cleaning the ranks, and starting fresh.

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly the most profound, yet depressing, answer so far.  Depressing because I think you&#39;re right.  Judging by the responses so far most of r/conspiracy agrees.  Depressing/frustrating.</p>

<p>So... we&#39;re up against a problem the resists a solution?  No fixing this?  There has to be some positive outlook in this for at least r/conspiracy users, otherwise what&#39;s your motivation?  There needs to be a goal in this for each of us, and I&#39;d expect (hope) its a similar goal right?</p>

<p>I actually have very little idea on how to correct the current thinking in society, nor do I have even a half thought out idea on preventing it from repeating in human history.  Maybe, the answer is out of just reach right now.</p>
