    <div class="md"><p>First of all, the &quot;end of the world&quot; that was <em>predicted</em> came about because several years ago they found a Mayan long count tablet that ended on 12/21/12.  That is the only reason why people assumed it would have any significance: the calender abruptly ends on that date.  Even though Mayan translators explained the calender system of Baktuns, this idea spiraled out of control.  In 2009, the next long count calender was found, so this should have ended the hysteria.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at what the Mayans actually &#39;meant&#39; with the coming of a new age, which is a very likely scenario.  Millions, possibly up to the number of a billion people have fed into this bullshit apocalypse hype created by the western world.  As this time passes over, all of these people who have been preparing for this date for years will suddenly realize that their purpose isn&#39;t to survive the end of the world; it&#39;s just to survive, to live, to do, to create their own purpose.  As we pass one of the most anticipated doomsdays in history, I would say the realization that our social problems aren&#39;t going to fix themselves out of some prophecy is enough to wake anyone up into a new age of human potential and responsibility, as the Mayans actually predict with the end of the Baktun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what stupid, gullible end of the world theory will you waste countless time on next?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Far from stupid or gullible, the world economy is on the verge of collapse at the same time we&#39;re about to go into WWIII.  There will be civil unrest nearly everywhere, and it&#39;s no coincidence that the US is currently trying to disarm the public.  When people have limited access to resources like water and medicine, food, money because their government failed to protect them from bankers, lied to them, purposely disarmed them, and acted only on personal interests the type of civil unrest occurring will seem like the end of the world for many.  This isn&#39;t just a <em>doomsday theory</em>.  It&#39;s an inevitability of current circumstances.</p>

<p>I believe in 2029 we&#39;re supposed to be either blessed with a close call or struck by an object. Apparently if we&#39;re struck it will likely strike the pacific and we can observe the effects without going the way of the dinosaurs.</p>
