<p>Women of Reddit. I ask you to watch any TV show or movie of a romantic comedy that was meant only for men. The message that media portrays to men is that he&#39;s a Player and a woman should be a slut for him.</p>

<p>These are contradictory ideas! How can a Princess be a slut? And how can a Player be subservient? We are all equal.</p>

<p>Wake up and stop watching TV and think for yourself. Come up with a solution to relationships that does no harm to others, and works for you and everyone around you. We need new ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One hundred percent correct. And of course, this is not the only example of how insidiously we are divided and polarized instead of united and working together. There are too many more examples to list but as even the most superficial understanding will convey, it is men against women, rich against poor, government against citizens, race against race, country against country, etc etc. </p>

<p>Drones have killed more people in Pakistan than were killed on 9/11. Much harder to get away with this if the average westerner identified the victims as ordinary working slobs just like them. </p>

I have no answers but as you point out, the very fact that these were the people who were so mercilessly rooted out and destroyed by the incoming power of the day is very telling. Who benefits, indeed. And I believe this is part of the answer or maybe, the answer in its entirety. If you have any more information or wish to discuss privately, please PM me. Actually, never mind, I will send you a PM shortly myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re getting confused between Bible-derived Christianity and the Roman Catholic church which was a de facto state power of the Holy Roman Empire. The Catholic church is the primary body to have adopted a &quot;violent scorched-earth policy&quot; and hunt down heretics who disagreed -- who most often included regular old Bible-believing Christians who refused to submit to the alternative teachings of the church. Similarly in today&#39;s world, Catholicism is recognized as synonymous to Christianity when it is nothing of the sort at all -- and Christianity is likewise known by nothing but the inappropriate behavior of the ignorant, who represent the teachings of the Bible just as poorly. You condemn Christianity on the basis that it is the power that governs the minds of present day culture, but it isn&#39;t. It is rather this bastardized and inaccurately represented version which has done so. You likewise glorify Gnosticism on the basis that the present day agenda has persecuted it and kept it hidden, but this is also false: rather, Gnosticism is better represented by what our current world knows as Christianity than the actual teachings of the Bible are, by a wide margin, and New Age beliefs, which are considered among the fastest-growing religious beliefs to have ever existed in the world, are highly derivative of Gnostic beliefs also. If anything is being &quot;hidden,&quot; it is <em>real Christianity.</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>That is an interesting viewpoint considering that there&#39;s an excellent chance that those beliefs would be highly derivative of something which has already been adulterated, aka something someone pulled out of their ass, basically. Lipstick on a pig, as it were. Polishing a turd, as they say. :) So therefore, a goodly portion of New Age would be from the same provenance. How do I know this? Simple. Because the first rule of Mystery School is that you don&#39;t talk about Mystery School. You can find all kinds of stuff online, but best of luck with that since it will all be highly adulterated also. </p>

<p>So, since anyone who really knows anything about it doesn&#39;t talk about it, and even those truly in the know are vanishingly few, I deduce there&#39;s a very good chance that anything that is said about it in public is mostly bullshit with some possible hits here and there at most. Elementary, if you ask me. ;)</p>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If anything is being &quot;hidden,&quot; it is real Christianity.</p>

<p>Ha ha...no. I&#39;m not interested in getting into a snotty, pseudo-intellectual masturbatory debate or pissing contest about it but, you should read the Lash book the guy recommends. The author makes an interesting case against the concept that there is <em>or ever was</em> any such thing as &quot;real Christianity&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alienation, originally a Marxist term, allows for people to permit/submit to crazy things. Not many of us would allow someone to starve to death, work in a sweatshop, be a child soldier, or put pigs into tortuously small pens for their lives - but only when it&#39;s in front of us. Hide the pigs in big barns so we can&#39;t see them, never let the child soldiers have representation in the media, put the sweatshops in southeast Asia, make it so difficult to do anything about people starving in Africa and <em>boom</em>, we permit it all.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s the story we should push to the forefront, because IMO, ultimately it is our success or failure in understanding this story which will decide our fate as a species. And so far, in this current epoch of history, we are failing miserably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all deeply ingrained in culture and the masses are slow to catch up.</p>

<p>As little as 50 years ago a girl had no hope and no expectations of lifting herself out of poverty or bettering her life unless a man came along and provided it for her. There were a few women who were able to do it on their own but like Black people, it was an uphill fight all the way and her &quot;femininity&quot; (which was like her sexual identity) was often questioned.</p>

<p>Of course circumstances have changed now but such a deeply rooted attitude can be slow to change. Consider that most people still think a woman who has sex with different men a &quot;slut&quot; and there is really no male equivalent word for &quot;whore&quot;. How many women brag about how many men they&#39;ve slept with? And yet men still do, even if they have to lie about it.</p>

<p>People with courage have &quot;balls&quot; but not &quot;ovaries&quot;. Sounds silly to most people doesn&#39;t it? <em>That&#39;s because these thing are so deeply ingrained</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is very insightful. Television, Hollywood, and Mass Advertising have steered genders into these cookie cutter personas. They&#39;re trying to get us to buy into these false beliefs that have been completely manufactured to keep us in constant conflict . They want the essence of our relationships to fail by making us into these superficial people.It&#39;s complete bullshit. Once you start waking up you realize how this reality is more of an illusion; that was meant to keep us down. But don&#39;t worry. We&#39;re waking up and aren&#39;t going to take it anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember at the height of JackAss&#39;s popularity, Dateline ran a special on gender roles being sold to teens. The thesis of the show was, if you&#39;re male then the &quot;cool&quot; new way to behave was to be a &quot;mook&quot;, an idiot that will purposefully endanger themselves for the sake of making others laugh. This &quot;mook&quot; character (think Johnny Knocksville) had sex appeal to women because women are hard-wired to seek a protector in their mate; the essence of being the mook is to run head first into danger and laugh as the consequences ensue. Observing this provokes a reaction in all people, but the message it sends to women is that these mooks possess a pseudo-imperviousness to death and danger and are therefore suitable as mates (although the JackAss crew was rarely ever in any real danger.) The catch-22 of this behavior being that although you have your peers&#39; attention, you most certainly do not have their respect. Dateline labeled the female counterpart to the mook, the &quot;midriff&quot; in reference to the new fashion trend of teenage girls wearing tops that show off the navel. This &quot;midriff&quot; can also be thought of as what men are hard-wired to seek in a mate, that being the &quot;girl/woman&quot;; the girl/woman is a girl who has just hit the peak of puberty, usually around the age of 15, who therefore has the appearance of a sexually mature woman yet the immaturity and lack of experience of a girl. Men want the girl/woman because its the smartest investment of time and energy they can put into a mate: she is young enough so that men know they can control her but just old enough to reproduce. Any time you witness a grown woman speaking like a baby to be sexy for a man, this is an example of the girl/woman. You see the girl/woman in many commercials because its a symbol that universally speaks to the male subconscious (why do you think the school girl fetish is so popular?). The examples of the girl/woman/&quot;midriff&quot; are staggering: Joey from Dawson&#39;s Creek, Donna from That 70s show (went to a catholic all girls school and wore a catholic school girls uniform in later episodes), Juno, the entire female cast of Skins, most of the sex symbols Nickelodeon and Disney sell to children fit the bill as well (Arianna Grande&#39;s character in Victorious comes to mind). Annie&#39;s christmas song in Community is a brilliant deconstruction of this phenomena (&quot;you smartie, me dumb, help Annie have fun! Boop ee doop ee doop boop SEX!&quot;.)This girl/woman formula being what equals sexy is also the same reason why the woman/girl makes men&#39;s dicks invert back into our bodies. Examples of females with the outward appearance of a girl but the behavior of an adult include: Orphan (the recent horror movie), HitGirl in KickAss (this works, I think, because when the film was made Chloe Moretz was about 13 but you better believe that she&#39;s being primed to be a sex symbol in the next installment), and Ellen Page in Hard Candy. The idea of a girl  of superior intelligence and maturity is threatening to men because once they can think for themselves they stop being malleable dough in our hands that we can convince need us for protection and they start being self-reliant femme fatales.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We live in a media driven society. The television&#39;s flickering blue light tells us what we should want and what success is. It also tells us how to behave in relationships. We giggle along with the laugh-track and subconsciously believe the propaganda they pump into our heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is nothing new. Today we call it TV shows. Couple of generations ago they were called TV &quot;Programs&quot;.</p>

<p>TV works for the majority of those who were raised solely on it. This is a generation that is slowly phasing out. Eventually this platform will become less relevant to the youth and lose penetration.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a generation y&#39;er myself. I grew up on both watching TV and the internet. Guess which I spend more time on. You guessed it. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/business/media/03television.html?_r=0">I&#39;m not the only one either</a>. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, we still consume the same kinds of media/content. The platform is just different. And there in lies the biggest difference, it is the lack of control. The same opportunity exist for misinfo/programming. However even the smallest guy can have a big voice on the internet and challenge it.</p>

<p>That is where everyone&#39;s concern should lie in, the bigger picture. When are they actually going to close in and seal the deal for internet regulation. Will it be behind closed doors (which hasn&#39;t worked thus far) or will the American people demand it?</p>

Making some men very feminine and combined with recent media being pushed global they are brainwashed into gayness :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you shouldn&#39;t trust anyone on the internet, but you can google recent real scientific studies into genes and gay/bi/lesbian to find it out for yourself. People fall in love, has nothing to do with genes, people used to believe certain genes made people poor as well. It&#39;s just useless food for thought left over from the geneticist era pre ww2, you may choose to believe it, but it&#39;s not true. Just as people get the wrong impression of things due to an unscientific classification method called psychiatry. No one is pre-determined this or that. Choices and chemistry.</p>

<p>Not always, but statistically, the lack of a 2 parents insures a much higher chance of getting in to trouble.</p>

<p>2 parents means more monitoring, a higher standard of living if both are employed, or at least if one has a job that can pay enough to keep the bills from piling up or affecting someone&#39;s stard of living.</p>

<p>I grew up in a single parent family. I got in lots of trouble because I lacked a stable home life that could provide for my needs. I got into stealing shit because it was easy and I could have what rich people had.</p>

<p>With better role models/stronger parental supervision, better standard of living, it would have saved me from getting into trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being downvoted because it is fairly true.</p>

<p>Jewish people are culturally and religiously Jewish.</p>

<p>The US is predominantly Christian except for the media industry which does have a statistically higher ratio of Jewish people working as writers, actors, directors, producers, etc...</p>

<p>Jewish people can be atheist and still Jewish, unlike Christians, which is sort of a weird double standard. The rise of atheism in culture over the last 20 years is distinctly because Jewish attitudes projected via pop culture make a rise in young Christians adopting Atheist values.</p>

<p>Jewish people only make like 2% of the overall US population, but because they side with other minorities, they&#39;ve formed a coallition of leftist groups like feminists, black rights groups, gay rights groups, and more.</p>

<p>Not that i&#39;m trying to protect Christianity because i&#39;m not religious, but there is a war on christians that is subversively perpetuated by Hollywood.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even really a consipracy. It&#39;s just a bunch of different guys writing their attitude which comes off as anti-christian.</p>

<p>Adam Sandler, Seth Rogan, Seth Green, etc...</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re so close to Christmas, look at the plethora of anti-Christ christmas episodes in &#39;adult cartoons&#39; like South Park, American Dad, Family Guy, Simpsons, Futurama, etc... </p>

<p>Seriously, watch all the christmas episodes from these shows and you&#39;ll see a bunch of standard plot gags.</p>

<p>main character fights Santa.</p>

<p>main character learns about commercialism</p>

<p>main character learns to cope with different cultural versions of christmas, usually Hannukeh, or Kwanzaa (which was only boosted so Hannukah isn&#39;t standing alone against Christmas).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard that term.</p>

<p>I&#39;d avoid it personally since it makes a sweeping generalization, especially when there&#39;s Jewish guys like Noam Chomsky who help expose media bias.</p>

<p>Hollywood &amp; the entertainment industry was founded by Jewish businessmen who support Israel and Zionism, but not all Jewish people want to be lumped in with those guys.</p>

<p>I actually see Jewish people, as well as Christians, non Christians, Muslims, all getting shafted by the media which exploits people in different ways.</p>

<p>Jewish people get a lot of &#39;Jewish guilt&#39; thrown at them if they don&#39;t support their culture. Nothing says conditioning like reinforcing stereotypes to manipulate people via emotional control.</p>

<p>&#39;If you don&#39;t support Israel, your Great Auntie will be sooooo upset&#39;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s brainwashing, like Sunday School for Christians.</p>

<p>Seth Rogan&#39;s new movie is horribly enough called &#39;<a href="http://youtu.be/21igv6-MYj4">The Guilt Trip</a>&#39;. It&#39;s a road trip buddy movie with Barbara Streisand who plays his quirky mom.</p>

<p>Seth Rogan, and Barbara Streisand. Ew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty hilarious, the OP is obviously venting on his tribulations with woman. He doesn&#39;t like how his body type, morbid obesity [ something like that ] is pushed as being negative, and doesn&#39;t like how men who actually care about their bodies are pushed into the main-stream media and OP cuts himself every time he see&#39;s another man succeeding and him failing whether it&#39;s with his sexual life or physically.</p>

<p>I also find it funny how you call a woman who likes to have sex with her partner a slut, where as how I thought of it, a slut is a woman who has sex with many different men at the same time. So i&#39;m just curious if you think men and woman who get their freak on 1 on 1 are sluts, because if that&#39;s so you&#39;re kind of retarded.</p>

<p>And do you really think those romantic comedies are a big deal? Everyone know that their fucking retarded, it&#39;s a joke, that&#39;s why everyone laughs and &#39;&#39; giggles &#39;&#39; at them, if you take them seriously, the joke is kind of on you.  </p>
