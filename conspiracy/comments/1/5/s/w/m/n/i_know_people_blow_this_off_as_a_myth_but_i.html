        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, there are several credible websites that state cannabis has anti-tumor qualities, and can cure cancer. I will list a few below. My grandmother had stage four cancer. One of her doctors, who was 60 years old or so, said it was the worst he had ever seen in his life. She was given a month to a year to live. My uncle who lives in New Mexico and works for a dispensary made cannabis oil and gave it to her. She just found out she is now in remission.</p>

<p>I know the government and media would have you believe that cannabis is bad, that it&#39;s a drug, and it&#39;s dangerous. I&#39;ve done a lot of research and cannabis used to be one of the substances doctor&#39;s administered to their patients in the early 20th century. Because hemp is so versatile, it threatened many industries (like paper, for example), and nowadays people are taught that it&#39;s a &quot;bad thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it really so hard to believe that marijuana can cure cancer? I don&#39;t expect to change the world&#39;s opinion on cannabis, but if I can at least convince a few people, it&#39;s good enough for me. No one should have to lose a loved one because the mainstream media and government misinform us.</p>

<p>Here are some more credible websites: <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/healthprofessional/page4">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/healthprofessional/page4</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/marijuana-and-cancer_n_1898208.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/marijuana-and-cancer_n_1898208.html</a> <a href="http://www.endalldisease.com/harvard-study-says-marijuana-cures-cancer/">http://www.endalldisease.com/harvard-study-says-marijuana-cures-cancer/</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/01/cannabis-for-infants-brai_n_2224898.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/01/cannabis-for-infants-brai_n_2224898.html</a></p>

<p>It would be helpful if you could say what cancer she had.  Mostly they are each treated with different chemos or hormones or hormone suppressants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She had Squamous Cell Carcinoma, or skin cancer. They discovered it at stage four. They never were able to find the primary spot of the cancer, because it is often microscopic. She was told the most chemo/radiation would do would to MAYBE extend her life a little bit longer, so instead she used cannabis oil. She did have spots on her liver, and on female parts and lymph nodes in her groin area. The doctors didn&#39;t know if she&#39;d even make it to Christmas, but she did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it does, but I think what you mean to say is that this incident does not prove anything by itself. 
A collection of these kinds of stories constitutes evidence (not necessarily proof, but good evidence). 
Plus the OP provided other links to back up his anecdotal evidence.</p>
