    <div class="md"><p>Nah man. I don&#39;t buy into that shill shit really. If you think about, well at least not on reddit. I for certain think they hit digg yahoo YouTube but reddit is still not mainstream enough for them to worry about. All they need to mind control is just over half the population so they would most likely stick to the major publications to make sure nothing slipped through know what I mean? They would have to pay an army of soulless neckbeards to control reddit, and they would probably still not be able to handle these crazy animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short its data mining the hard way. I&#39;m just getting as much information as I can. I have never once been honest with you I&#39;m telling you this now due to tard banning my username AGAIN. So I will dump info and start over. It won&#39;t ever end until you have somehow incriminated yourself or leave. As long as there is conspiratard there will be this anonymous guy trolling you possibly befriending you I roll in different each time and single out a few of you and compile your info. I&#39;m an analyst. I go for patterns. All the while looking for the silver bullet. The game has been afoot for sometime. I don&#39;t stop I am relentless because I do get paid for this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many times you idiots need to dox our members, but you really don&#39;t need to go through the trouble of some super secret agent doxing. Just ask us, most of us have been doxed already, several times over. Hell some of you guys have mailed creepy shit to my house. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certainly from my point of view from the outside. Looks like there is something very fishy going on and I&#39;m new at this shit. I was in what I thought was a debate of which I won fairly easily, but my score does not represent that at all. I watched as downvotes started falling on me regardless of whether I made a good point or not which shows that there are some serious issues here. It also looks like you guys had each other on speed dial, or one of you is a radio DJ in Tel Aviv, and called in a reddit blitzkrieg. Of this there is no doubt. So if you can&#39;t control your forces maybe there should be a massive ban. Is it not one of your rules not to cross post?</p>
