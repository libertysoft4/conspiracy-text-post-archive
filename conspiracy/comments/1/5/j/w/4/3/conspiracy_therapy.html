        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello. I am wondering-- are there any other redditors on here who have gone through those terrible spells, days or even sometimes weeks long, where you just feel like you know way too much of the bad shit that is controlling <em>everything</em>, and you just don&#39;t know what to do about it, how to handle it, or how to successfully compartmentalize the information into manageable brain-packets so that it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s consuming you?</p>

<p>Sometimes I just hate knowing shit, being aware of shit, huge shit, that has or is affecting things on a global scale for the betterment and enrichment of the smallest percentage at the expense and misery of whole populations. I am glad to be one of the &#39;awakened&#39; and no longer one of the bleating automatons, but.... sometimes I just wish I could turn off the knowledge of What Things Are.</p>

<p>So, to reiterate-- anyone else out there feel this way? How do you personally deal with it when it gets bad for you? What are your own personal devices for handling this heavy shit that no one wants to give a sweet shit about because it gets in the way of them being perpetually glued to Farmville or Dancing With the Stars? </p>

<p>No wannabe debunkers or haters please. This is for people that read the title for this post and took keen notice on the purposeful omission of the word &#39;theory&#39;.</p>

<p>Life is a shit on Africa, Middle East and South Asia, however. To offset that, try to remember that all your cheap stuff and your life quality depends on them being exploited, and that in the current economical system, you can&#39;t have everyone with iPods and food on the table. There aren&#39;t resources to make the life of everyone like Scandinavian countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they are limited. Basic math would do the trick. Calculate how much materials are needed to be extracted to make a computer and its components (like rare earth materials). Calculate how much energy from non-renewed sources are used to make the computers, to run them, to transport them. Calculate how much wood is necessary to build all our architectural buildings with fancy windows. Calculate how much land is needed to cultivate the food for our cattle. Calculate how much fuel is needed to transport it. Now multiply by 7 or 8. The world cannot even sustain the CURRENT needs. The excessive consumption of fossil fuels (solid and liquid carbon that was not in the atmosphere) is already fucking up the entire climate. The food needs are destroying lands in Africa, Asia and Latin America (because in Europe and USA, the useful land is already taken). The lack of reserves of rare earth materials is already a big concern. You just can&#39;t have everyone living well on the planet. Now, if you kill some people, things might get better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started reading r/conspiracy right after sandy hook and right away got consumed with information on everything. I started looking directly into actual history and what could be. Its horrible. Literally have to sit there and say to myself, &quot;wow this world is lost, there&#39;s nothing I can do.&quot; And go right back to my normal life with my glock 27 strapped to my waist ready for someone to try to take away my rights. There&#39;s nothing you can do without informing people who think obama is going to take care of them. People are so unaware of life and what it could actually be other than what they tell us in the media. I don&#39;t think there are any honest governments, we just have more to lose. You know those things they call rights and freedom... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there is this theory that, smart people are more likely to get depressed.  Their knowhow of any given subject, the depth and gravity make them think Oh my oh my all is hopeless.  There is actually a condition for that, I need to go ask <a href="/r/psychology">/r/psychology</a> about it.  <strong>BUT</strong> most actually are not.  In fact the less knowledgeable person is more likely to get depressed when in conflict because they do not know what to do; while smart people build a bridge and get over their conflicts.  Though &quot;ignorance is bliss is true&quot; when there is a problem, your knowledge is your edge.</p>

<p><strong>The price you pay for learning is always worth it.  Work at it, don&#39;t give up, or give in.</strong></p>

<p>How do I deal with being a critical thinker among groups of people who idolize boobs/sports think demo/repu are different?  I&#39;m a sociopath.  you mad bro? you jelly bro? you happy bro? I am none of these, don&#39;t listen to what anyone says, it is the greatest deficiency there is. If you want happiness, relaxation, something to take the pressure off; try pot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I guess I&#39;d say before I knew how the world worked I was happier but only out of ignorance. The constant barrage of shit at times can be genuinely convincing but were not special for finding anything out, you&#39;ve just taken more notice than other people. Look at the discussion going about the recent round of gun talks or why Obama isn&#39;t all like Jesus and our saviour. People are not falling for shit anymore so the elite are getting desperate to pass everything in a short space of time.</p>

<p>Put the law together that have been passed in recent times.</p>

<p>Real time nationwide spying on all communications and also them being stored,</p>

<p>Arrest without trial and detention without legal recourse,</p>

<p>Proposed gun bans ranging in severity,</p>

<p>Protest crackdowns, out of control militarisation and behaviour of police.</p>

<p>Put these together and you have let the government position themselves <em>legally</em> to control and stifle your options to rebel effectively.</p>
