<p>I think that a good conspiracy theory is one that credits others with its credibility. The official story (which by the way I do not trust entirely either) has eyewitness testimony from dozens of people. Whether these people are &#39;bought off&#39; is another story, but at least it has that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except I&#39;d say a well formed hypothesis is more than bullshit. It&#39;s formed from an educated guess and understanding of things around you. The biggest problem with conspiracies is that anyone with enough time can pull together things that seem convincing even if they are basically wrong and what&#39;s worse is that on the Internet 90% of the people who watch a video about a conspiracy won&#39;t do the research themselves and instead gossip to all their friends that it was a conspiracy. </p>

<p>No offense to those who frequent <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but usually a person who wraps themselves up in a bunch of conspiracies isn&#39;t very intelligent and instead are just following a real intelligent person (at least intelligent enough to weave great stories and find things others don&#39;t. Even if they are just connecting dots they created themselves). </p>

<p>Again I&#39;m not trying to be offensive to people who come to this sub as I don&#39;t ever come here. There are probably a lot more intelligent people here though than your average conspiracy following nut, and I say that because people on sites like reddit are more likely to research to some extent even if it&#39;s only by reading large #s of comments and putting the truth together from there.  </p>

<p>Then it&#39;s a shitty theory. You should absolutely never but any stock into ANYTHING that doesn&#39;t have evidence to back it up, or is at least logically consistent and similar to other similar events that have evidence.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware, the only real case against the official story is the RIP facebook pages going up early, which is really, really weird if true, and it really makes me question things. However, inconsistencies about a gunman are understandable, and the idea that people who are supposedly just leaving a school shooting would be in a position to give you a perfect witness&#39; statement is just fucking ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the medical examiner&#39;s claims that all wounds were caused by &quot;the long weapon&quot; (.223), even though police were seen removing that weapon from a drug dealer&#39;s car that was claimed to be Adam Lanza&#39;s.  This is video that you can watch for yourself right this minute.  Perhaps you have a good explanation for the additional suspects being chased through the woods, again, on video.  Or Robbie Parker, who was caught getting into character on camera?  How about the FEMA exercise 14 miles away &quot;caring for children in a crisis&quot; or something to that affect?  How about reports that the ERT (emergency response team) was too busy with an active shooter exercise?  How about Attorney General Eric Holder meeting with CT Governor Dannel Malloy and unveiling &quot;Project Longevity,&quot; a plan to reduce gun violence in Connecticut&#39;s biggest cities...weeks before Sandy Hook?  Why were emergency crews posted 5 minutes up the street instead of being allowed to get to the school?  Surely the scene was under control after they &quot;got Adam Lanza&quot;, right?  Why was there only one ambulance?  Why does the school nurse interviewed on TV not show up in the CT health professional database?  Why did the United Way Sandy Hook Relief Page have a creation date of December 11th, and beyond that, when they got caught, why the mother fuck did Google remove the timestamp from ONLY that search result?  Seriously, Google &quot;sandy hook united way&quot; right now and see for yourself.  Tenth result down for me, and the only one on the page without a timestamp.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to believe it, so I ignored people that said it was a ruse.  However, before I tried to say whether or not it was a conspiracy, I looked into it for myself.  I am truly taken aback.  Do some research before you rest those dick fingers upon thy keyboard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is still a conspiracy theory, but not quite as nefarious.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t most of the people who appear in that video celebrities who endorsed Obama? Didn&#39;t several of them, especially Rashida Jones, actively campaign for Obama?</p>

<p>I mean, this is a group of politically active and connected millionaires with nothing but time on their hands. It wouldn&#39;t take much to get these guys together, as long as you have access. Someone working with the White House probably has all of their names and phone numbers on a list, or at least the names of their publicists and agents. It would not take very long to get a group of independently wealthy politically active celebrities together in order to make a video like this.</p>

<p>The script was probably already written. I see a lot of stuff posted to this sub about, for example, how because the invasion of Afghanistan took place so quickly it proves there were already plans drawn up for the war, and that is proof that 9/11 was a false flag event. I&#39;m sorry, but that is bullshit. There are teams of people who are paid to do nothing but sit around and draw up plans for possible events. Strategists and diplomats war game all the damn time. <em>High school students</em> do this shit in Model UN. People spend time doing this stuff, it is just a fact.</p>

<p>So you look at this video, and what do we have? Two gun ban organizations who, for the last 10 years or more, have been completely irrelevant because there has been absolutely zero public support for gun control legislation, making a video demanding legislation get passed. Dafuq do you think these organizations have been doing for the last ten years? Sitting with their thumbs up their assholes? No, they&#39;ve been plotting and strategizing, just like that cunt Feinstein, waiting for a pile of youngling bodies so they could advance their agenda.</p>

<p>So even if you don&#39;t want to go so far as to say that Sandy Hook was a false flag, at the very least it is reasonable to conclude that there has been a plan in place for a very long time among statists and people on the left to take advantage of such an event in order to push an agenda. That constitutes a conspiracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve put together instructional videos longer than that on tech related subjects that took less than a day to put together. It isn&#39;t <em>that</em> hard. Like I said, the only hard part of that video is getting the talent on set to record. Everything else takes very little time. The script is simple, probably canned. Filming isn&#39;t hard, as they probably just rented an existing set from a studio. I doubt multiple takes were necessary due to the simplicity of the script. Editing and publishing takes almost no time, especially on a video like this. Digital editing on an Avid machine is so simple a child could do it. I think I could make this in two hours on my iPhone, filming, editing, and publishing to YouTube, everything, as long as I had access to the talent. I think you&#39;re overestimating the complexity of such a production.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slightly off topic but... Asking for the answer is a good way to never know anything. Personally, when it comes to a lot of current events, you really need to do your own research as while you will often never find out the 100% truth you will come to know the discrepancies and possiblities more thoroughly. This means that while you may not know the truth, you will likely no what isn&#39;t the truth. Also you will likely understand what parties and/or important aspects of a topic more clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your point?</p>

<p>If a person wants to make a claim and convince others of the veracity of that claim, that person is going to need to provide details that can be verified.  Without them, its just one more anecdote that proves nothing. 9/11 at least has details that can be fact checked and since it was mechanical in nature, the physics can be verified.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook has a bunch if people trying to interpret the emotional level of the parents with zero training and scant video data to determine that they are actors - despite how illogical of an idea it is. There&#39;s no call for actors unless the kids weren&#39;t killed. Any dead kid will have REAL PARENTS. If he kids weren&#39;t killed, that means every first responder and every person at that school is complicit - another outlandish idea.</p>

<p>The problem with Sandy Hook is that no hard evidence has surfaced, despite the claims of this alleged police officer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ &quot;Globalresearch.ca may best be described as a left-wing equivalent to WingNutDaily. It is the website of the Montreal based non-profit The Centre for Research on Globalisation (CRG), founded by Michel Chossudovsky. The website describes itself as an &quot;independent research and media organization&quot;. Globalresearch.ca takes pride in being a reliable &quot;alternative news&quot; source serving as a major repository of a broad range of &quot;news articles, in-depth reports and analysis on issues which are barely covered by the mainstream media&quot; (such as the New World Order). Its politico-economic stance is strongly anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, anti-militarist, internationalist but anti-globalization. Its view of science, the economy and geopolitics seems to be broadly conspiracist. [...] The prevalent conspiracist strand relates to global power-elites (primarily governments and corporations) and their New World Order. Specific featured conspiracy theories include those addressing 9/11, vaccines, Zionism, global warming, and David Kelly.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s the best researched report to date - then it is obvious that the entire story of a psy-ops element is total bullshit.</p>

<p>The medical examiner didn&#39;t show the usual swagger in the interview? Seriously? How is that pertinent? How does that reveal some nefarious intent? It&#39;s fucking ridiculous and speculative - proves NOTHING and doesn&#39;t even imply conspiracy.</p>

<p>In fact, that link is pure dogshit.  Every stupid aside put in by the author questions things that are obvious and completely understandable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Lets just take this example from his analysis of the coroner&#39;s interview.</p>

<p>Carver says he only did 7 autopsies and doesn&#39;t have detailed info on all the injuries in a December 15th interview.</p>

<p>Author adds</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given that Carver is Connecticut&#39;s top coroner and in charge of the entire postmortem, this is a startling admission.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Less than 24 hours later, this author expects 28 autopsies to be completed?? That&#39;s worse than being mentally retarded - it&#39;s willful ignorance and only an idiot could fail to see this. The entire piece is riddled with these pointed speculations that go against basic sense.</p>

<p>So, sorry, but that link only convinces me of the stupidity of this incessant need to pin this event on dark governmental forces.  Not every tragedy in America has black helicopters hovering over it.  Those who fail to understand that basic fact are just as easily manipulated as the sleeping masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said to myself ....if the victims&#39; families suddenly start moving away to different parts of the country, or to other countries altogether, have any affiliations to very wealthy organizations (which some will simply be common due to the location in CT being wealthy) but I mean, really large stockholding companies (JP Morgan Stanley/Rockefeller family/Washington DC connections UN connections/research based international law) and if these families have tended to arrive/appear in CT a few  years ago only from all over the place THEN that would show they swooped in, did some stuff, never planned to stay long, and are swooping back out. Brief thought a couple weeks ago, then forgot about it.</p>

<p>SUDDENLY I HEAR ON THE NEWS: &quot;the Sherlachs were planning on retiring this year and moving to their cabin&quot;, &quot;the sherlachs were about to move to their lakehouse&quot;, and &quot;The Pozners are leaving CT in the wake of the tragedy and going to Seattle&quot; and &quot;The Hockleys, who recentlyl moved here from England after also living in Australia and (asia?) are now planning on moving.&quot;   Transient. And none of the local Newtonians were close with, or really, really knew the victims&#39; families. Cardboard cutouts, poster families.</p>

<p>I also speculated that &quot;family members&quot; would start coming out of the woodwork into the media to make statements and that these family members would have different last names, be from other parts of the country, have political or wealthy affiliations and agendas themselves, and make mention of a recent family meet up or a recent reunion at which their &quot;kids just met for the first time&quot;.  Well, such was the case for Noah Pozner (Allegedly deceased 6 yr old, hopefully not :(  ) when his politically affiliated uncle by the last name of Haller mentioned that their sons- cousins- met in Seattle in April of 2012 for the 1st time since they were babies, and really &quot;hit it off, and their family was planning on moving out here.&quot;</p>

<p>All of the speculations I so fleetingly made have started to actually ..... occur. Their behavior is what would be expected of a group of people who acted in accordance with a plan, came in to complete a mission, and now have to leave.</p>

That it&#39;s someones job to sit down and make a plan just in case something bad happens....hence Afghanistan. I actually need not go any further because that just answered itself. As for needing an excuse for gun regulations...don&#39;t you think it was already on the table after aurora? Oh and a bunch of Sikhs were killed while praying just a few days after that. Now a bunch of kids were murdered by some stupid ass kid. It&#39;s a no brainer. As for the shooting itself being fake. That&#39;s a pretty elaborate set up. I know the government is capable of despicable things when it wants, but this is a pretty big hoax to have such a lame story. Come on. This kid was fucked in the head. If not for his father and brother leaving, then for his whack job mom who believed in all this conspiracy shit. He could easily of been one of your own kids or siblings. He just believed all the bull shit. And unfortunately for him and all those kids, it was just bull shit his mom crammed down his throat. And as for batman being part of the conspiracy.

We cant say for sure what happened there or did anyone saw 20 bodybags taken out of that school, maybe there are other schools involved, but the main thing is, the pictures on your tv screen wanted to tell you that one young dude had balls to kill bunch of small kids with rifle, and thats why guns are bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can tell, gay fascist lesbians from the somethingawful.com forums (hello SRS), who were brought into DHS under Obama, are using Israeli death squads to perpetrate false flag mass shootings aimed at banning guns and demonizing the last bastions of political opposition (libertarians, aspies, preppers, tax avoiders, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_nativism">nativists</a>) in preparation for their long-planned socialist coup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some dude went and killed 20 kids, i personally believe he was hired by the goverment in order to promote a certain political idea, in this case heavy gun control or banning guns. Hitler did say the best way to take over a country is to disarm it. I believe a similar thing happened with aurora batman shooting.</p>
