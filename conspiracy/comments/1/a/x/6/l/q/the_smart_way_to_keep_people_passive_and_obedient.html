    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, I think that he knows that 9/11 is way more than just fishy, but it still really doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just a one big distraction. Even if it is true that the U.S. government is directly or indirectly involved in 9/11, it would be extremely hard to prove. </p>

<p>That deflects away a lot of people&#39;s attention to a subject that may very well never be fully exposed as long as the current system is in place.</p>

<p>Instead, people should focus their attention to the all the problems that are known to be there. </p>

<p>Mainly to the fact that mo matter whether it is caused by malice, stupidity or greed, the people who are currently in power all over the world are by definition extremely incompetent and should be removed as soon as possible. By removed, I mean nothing more than that, removed from their position of power, any further measures are not up to a man to decide.</p>

<p>In this context, I would define competence of the world&#39;s leaders as the ability to act in the interest of the human kind and the planent in both present time and the future, at that, the majority of them fail, and fail miserably. </p>

<p>Again, they are incompetent and should be removed, we can&#39;t sustain this anymore even if we wanted to. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I actually agree with Chomsky on 9/11 on conspiracy theories in general. His dismissal of 9/11 theories is actually quite eloquent in both reasons and consequences. It comes down to scientific illiteracy of the people involved in disseminating these theories. </p>

<p>We can look at WTC 7 youtube videos for minute details that we can&#39;t explain (and once one is explained, just move on to the next one). All the while even if we replicated the whole thing as a <em>controlled experiment we would not be able to explain everything</em>.</p>

<p>Which is the case of any empirical experiments of complex enough phenomena. Why do you think people still have to fling cars at concrete obstacles at 40 mph to find out what happens to them? And now people expect a much more complex aircraft strike at a building to be explained completely?</p>

<p>If 9/11 was a government op, Chomsky would be the first to say so. He&#39;s devoted a large portion of his life to uncover what kind of evil stuff the US operations have done. </p>

Their argument is that they need time outside of the public spotlight to discuss policy, but that is and of itself is a conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>DING DING DING.  Go with that - it&#39;s a fucking winner.  </p>

<p>One of my favorite ideas is to drug test congress.  This has been suggested in various ways numerous times.  It&#39;s a winner - push this idea as much as you can.  It&#39;s not about making them piss in a cup, although that is fun, it&#39;s about demonstrating exactly what you&#39;re talking about.  The slippery slope is there and this is a way to draw attention to the issue in a very effective way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you a good idea.</p>

<p>&quot;Here is Bassma Kodmani, seen leaving this year&#39;s Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kodmani is a member of the executive bureau and head of foreign affairs, Syrian National Council. Kodmani is close to the centre of the SNC power structure, and one of the council&#39;s most vocal spokespeople. &quot;No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We can only discuss how to move on to a different political system,&quot; she declared this week. And here she is, quoted by the newswire AFP: &quot;The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII, which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This statement translates into the headline &quot;Syrians call for armed peacekeepers&quot; (Australia&#39;s Herald Sun). When large-scale international military action is being called for, it seems only reasonable to ask: who exactly is calling for it? We can say, simply, &quot;an official SNC spokesperson,&quot; or we can look a little closer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This year was Kodmani&#39;s second Bilderberg. At the 2008 conference, Kodmani was listed as French; by 2012, her Frenchness had fallen away and she was listed simply as &quot;international&quot; – her homeland had become the world of international relations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Back a few years, in 2005, Kodmani was working for the Ford Foundation in Cairo, where she was director of their governance and international co-operation programme. The Ford Foundation is a vast organisation, headquartered in New York, and Kodmani was already fairly senior. But she was about to jump up a league.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Around this time, in February 2005, US-Syrian relations collapsed, and President Bush recalled his ambassador from Damascus. A lot of opposition projects date from this period. &quot;The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005,&quot; says the Washington Post.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In September 2005, Kodmani was made the executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) – a research programme initiated by the powerful US lobby group, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The CFR is an elite US foreign policy thinktank, and the Arab Reform Initiative is described on its website as a &quot;CFR Project&quot; . More specifically, the ARI was initiated by a group within the CFR called the &quot;US/Middle East Project&quot; – a body of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers, the stated aim of which is to undertake regional &quot;policy analysis&quot; in order &quot;to prevent conflict and promote stability&quot;. The US/Middle East Project pursues these goals under the guidance of an international board chaired by General (Ret.) Brent Scowcroft.&quot;</p>

<p>Read the full article for the greater context. Its astonishing how a small, well organised group of people can start a war in a country. You get the whole gang mentioned in this article from Kissinger to Richard Perle and William Kristol and more of the same people you see when you actually look into things.</p>

He calls both the CIA and CFR &quot;nothing organizations.&quot; He sided with the completely bullshit Warren Commission that there was no conspiracy to assassinate JFK&#39; to do that you have to be either stupid or lying, and Chomsky is certainly not stupid. He&#39;s brilliant at drawing progressives away from looking at the &quot;over-the-line&quot; conspiracies that would wake people up to seeing how trul evil the peop n political power are- 9/11, JFK assassination, CIA involvement in the drug trade. He says, &quot;There&#39;s absolutely no evidence for any of this, and even if there were it would damage the Left to bring it out.&quot; How does that even make sense? It&#39;s disengenuous. This isn&#39;t just &quot;one thing.&quot; It&#39;s the events that expose high-level U.S. intelligence to be <em>Nazis,</em> which is what they are. Chomsky deftly changes the topic to &quot;institutionalism&quot;; i.e. the institutions are corrupt; it doesn&#39;t matter who fills them. He&#39;s a snake. We should be more critical. Furthermore, Chomsky&#39;s linguistics career was very anti-humanist, and would have been more sharply critiqued from progressives if not for Chomsky&#39;s ostensibly left-wing politics.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me an example of a statement of 9/11 that&#39;s out of the acceptable spectrum then.</p>

<p>To me that Chomsky quote means that politicians and the public have been manipulated and coerced into talking about issues without addressing  the heart and true causes of them. In other words the overlap between acceptable public opinion/discourse surrounding a certain issue and speech that substantively addresses and works to create a solution is very small, in some cases nonexistent.</p>

<p>This leaves us in a position where the inertia of the establishment continues to take us further and further from real solutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand exactly what you are saying but this.... is an entirely different branch of knowledge and philosophy. What you outlined is an extremely common &quot;spiritual&quot; principle.</p>

<p>This is exploring how consciousness influences and is manifested in material reality. Which is something that greatly interests me (and I believe this inherent connectedness makes a lot of stuff possible mainstream science has yet to recognize).</p>

<p>But we&#39;re talking abut political issues... I think that power structures in general need to, lets see how do I say it, not crowd out people who are open to these principles.</p>

<p>EDIT: So what I could say is, an idea outside the acceptable spectrum includes knowledge of the consciousness influence. An idea is acceptable if it operates as if this influence isn&#39;t real (it is) and that&#39;s how it perpetuates faulty power structures.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my take on it. It&#39;s one I actually agree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is enough evidence for human consciousness directly affecting the 3D reality we find ourselves in but I will put forward something that&#39;s even further outside the acceptable spectrum which would be something like this:
The universe, given it can be a highly elaborate &#39;computer&#39; simulation (as some scientists are now studying to find out if that&#39;s the true nature of Reality), has outside influence on events within it and events such as those that happened on 9/11 happened as a result of programs that were installed/initiated for some purpose that is currently beyond us. </p>

<p>This is just an example to illustrate that even the movement for 9/11 truth is operating within a sort of limiting spectrum with regards to the wider horizon of Reality that we as humans are only beginning to scratch the surface of. With 7 billion people on the planet and many of them still believing it was created by sky gods it&#39;s not difficult to see why we can&#39;t come to some basic agreement as to what Reality is, where/how it originates, and what is the purpose of it all, if any.</p>

I have not researched this topic a lot but I would think that something that originally has negative health effects for humans would build up over time in our &quot;low dose concentrations&quot; why do people automatically think that just because something is &quot;safe in low doses&quot; should be in all of our water? </p>

<p>I was just trying to stick with the facts. All of the studies that have documented evidence about negative effects of consuming fluoride, such as bone fluorosis, have shown that these problems are not observed at very low concentrations. </p>

<p>Major heath problems <em>do</em> show up at higher concentrations. And yes, that should be cause for concern and additional long-term studies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialist or Libertarian, i would argue that both our ideologies are outside of this spectrum, but still so opposed to each other that we will see the other side as part of it. This is why a revolution would fail, lots of angry people, angry over the same stuff (drones, DHS, 911 whether an inside job or just abused as a cause, crony capitalism) but we see different solutions and would just as soon fight each other once the establishment is gone. Too much division. Both are called crazy and extreme by the mainstream, i would argue that socialists probably have slightly more mainstream support, but its irrelevant. We could knock the current shit down then peacefully form 2 systems side by side, splitting the country/world, highly unlikely though, people would get power hungry. AnCap here if you hadnt figured it out already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Angry people are not the kind of people who can lead a revolution. Anger is just an emotion that has no power. People have to suffer a lot more before there&#39;s even a chance of revolution because revolution is the final choice. For a successful revolution (as in, one that brings some actual change, not necessarily one where the rebels win), enough of the rebels must care more about their ideals than their lives. </p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s definitely not likely that you could split two systems side by side with completely different ideals. That&#39;s just not how the tribal mind works, unfortunately. They have to be much more isolated than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree about the anger, peoples ideals being destroyed makes them angry, but not pure anger. Reasoned, meaningful, directed anger that is controlled to some degree by rationality. My point was mainly that the would be revolutionaries are too split ideologically either way. Only way it would happen is if one side became popular enough on its own to cause it, many of the users of this sub, for example, might be willing in theory but just too much division. You would have to get a huge percentage of the nation behind one ideolgical banner, not going to happen imo. At least in the next 10 years or so. Not willing to guess beyond that. </p>

<p>Anyways i think the anger you are speaking of is a few radicals blowing up a building or two, which could only hurt any real chance of one happening, so yeah unrestrained stupid anger isnt enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even talk of building 7 or Bilderberg is allowable because it reinforces the power structure.  As far as gvts and big money are concerned, as long as you accept that they are in charge, it enables them to get away with more and more.  There is nothing discussed in today&#39;s general society that is not within the extreme limits set.  Even in the realms of science, philosophy and belief thoughts are limited.  For instance, string theory, this is a popular theory for the Big Bang.  The Big Bang part of this theory states that when two universes come into contact with each other, another universe is created.  So far not one person has said &quot;okay, so where did the two universes that made ours come from, and which was the first one and how did that exist?&quot;  </p>

<p>By far the best is the so called use of logic in determining there is no God.  Okay, so let&#39;s use logic.  At the very start of the universe was a Big Bang, if this Big Bang did not have the precise energy that was emitted the universe would be very different and you would not exist, also if the very first particles that combined to become this planet had not combined at exactly the time they combined this planet would be different and you would not exist, this goes for every particle that helped this planet come into being, all must have happened precisely as it did, else you would not exist.  Then all the chemicals that make up this planet would have to have been precisely the same and came into being precisely when they did, a mere second out of synch and the planet would be different and you would not exist.  Next the life forms, from the very first single called creature that was yours and my deepest ancestor must have came into being at exactly the time it did, every split and cell death of the billions and billions of these single called creatures must have followed the exact, precise pattern, all cell deaths and deformities must have followed in the precise order that followed or life would be very different and you would not exist.  The evolution of this species into all the others, including couplings with exactly the same creatures at precisely the same time must have occurred else you would not exist.  For all of this to happen is mind boggling, but the real smoking gun is this, if all of this happened what are the real chances of your one shot at existence being right now?  Why not two trillion years in the future?  If you use logic for your own existence you have to conclude that your existing at all is illogical therefore you don&#39;t exist, you aren&#39;t reading this and you never will exist.  Or, the only other logical explanation would be that you always exist.</p>

<p>We are always encouraged to behave &#39;in the box&#39;, if are forced to believe there is both an earthly higher power I.e. governments, secret societies that control all earthly politics, and either no other power (such as a god) or a god that also has rules and regulations.  We are never told that this higher power is in fact ourselves, that truly it is us that wield the greatest power, if we all wanted rid of gvts, banks, money etc we would get rid of it.  Obama might be okay, but I know men in my local bar who could take him in a fight, in fact I think I could probably give him a good beating.  So, he is far from the most powerful man in the world.  We allow him to be!</p>

<p>This is long..... I was going to write about red shift, blue shift and einsteinium physics and the ramifications which is also very interesting and never, not ever, properly addressed.  Quickly, Einstien&#39;s theories equate to none of us having free will and every event from the beginning of time to the end is already set, the most frightening thing about this is he did the math to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democrats and republicans, Muslim extremists and Zionists, LGTG rights and ultra conservatives. </p>

<p>All the usual crap is basically the same thing. 
For everyone who thinks fuck the gays there is someone who thinks its gone too far.</p>

<p>For everyone who thinks Israel is doing its best to create a Palestinian  holocoust, there is the same who want Muslims wiped out in the name of freedom.</p>

<p>All this gun control version gun safety, is all bullshit </p>

<p>Real issues and real problems are quickly pushed into one or other categories. </p>

<p>Your own personal agenda is twisted to meet it. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t want tolerance you hate tolerance.</p>

<p>LGTG people don&#39;t want people to say its wrong and should not be allowed, but happy to say right wing ideologies are hateful </p>

<p>Zionists spout  the evil of Arabs but ignore there own evils.</p>

<p>And yet we still do it.</p>

<p>Hearty discourse with the same all shit brought up. Going no where, just creating offence.</p>

<p>So we all think it, but either told not to say it, or pretend not to think it.</p>

<p>Nothing, I mean nothing should be off the menu in conversations. </p>

<p>But quickly start brining up conversations that are not acceptable to your way of thinking and watch the &quot;we must stop this outrage button&quot; being pressed.</p>

<p>I read reddit and quickly you see themes.</p>

<p>The pro Israel lobby, pro guns, fuck Obama fuck gays 
Then the pro gay, pro environment, pro keeping those red neck fuckers from spouting hate groups.</p>

<p>All the above are just the fucking same while shouting how they are not.</p>

<p>Nothing should be off the table in a discussion. Nothing.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with asking if the holocoust happened, nothing at all. </p>

<p>Noting wrong with asking if eugenics is ok, if certain cultures are more stupid then others.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong If asking should women rule, should grown men be allowed to fuck 10 year old boys</p>

<p>Nothing wrong in asking if blacks are evolved at whites, if Asians are smarter, if Chinese are cruel fucks.</p>

<p>As people think these things. </p>

<p>So say then. Have discussion, start asking and searching for the taboo, the questions that make people squirm, that offend. </p>

<p>That can be done in a good way.</p>

<p>Is religion just a political tool for the scared, ignorant and dumb to be abused by the higher powers?</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we say, prophet Mohammed was a pedophile? 
That Jesus probably didnt exist?</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we say corporations can hire scientists to also promote their own agendas for money and have no moral fortitude.</p>

<p>That gangsters in suits are still gangsters, that America is run by corporations, that the western powers are servant to a Jewish and corporate lobby.</p>

<p>That western governments are now worse towards free speech than ever and they desperately want control of the Internet, loving the setting up of hate crime legislation in the name of order.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we question are own governments, are own family, our own leaders, our doctors, those union leaders and those soldiers.</p>

<p>We should, we must. We have to.</p>

<p>But we won&#39;t.</p>

<p>You will just be offended at the bits of this you disagree with and just love the bits you do.</p>

<p>Question you self and your own biases and ask where they came from.</p>

<p>Your family and friends are not you.</p>

<p>You must question yourself. </p>

<p>Now go and spread your own agenda while pretending you are not.</p>

<p>Question everything and let others question everything as well.</p>

Parenti didn&#39;t choose to spend his time researching these events that implicate U.S. intelligence as Nazis, but he he didn&#39;t spread a bunch of lies about them, and he acknowledges their validity.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you a good idea.</p>

<p>&quot;Here is Bassma Kodmani, seen leaving this year&#39;s Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kodmani is a member of the executive bureau and head of foreign affairs, Syrian National Council. Kodmani is close to the centre of the SNC power structure, and one of the council&#39;s most vocal spokespeople. &quot;No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We can only discuss how to move on to a different political system,&quot; she declared this week. And here she is, quoted by the newswire AFP: &quot;The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII, which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This statement translates into the headline &quot;Syrians call for armed peacekeepers&quot; (Australia&#39;s Herald Sun). When large-scale international military action is being called for, it seems only reasonable to ask: who exactly is calling for it? We can say, simply, &quot;an official SNC spokesperson,&quot; or we can look a little closer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This year was Kodmani&#39;s second Bilderberg. At the 2008 conference, Kodmani was listed as French; by 2012, her Frenchness had fallen away and she was listed simply as &quot;international&quot; – her homeland had become the world of international relations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Back a few years, in 2005, Kodmani was working for the Ford Foundation in Cairo, where she was director of their governance and international co-operation programme. The Ford Foundation is a vast organisation, headquartered in New York, and Kodmani was already fairly senior. But she was about to jump up a league.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Around this time, in February 2005, US-Syrian relations collapsed, and President Bush recalled his ambassador from Damascus. A lot of opposition projects date from this period. &quot;The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005,&quot; says the Washington Post.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In September 2005, Kodmani was made the executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) – a research programme initiated by the powerful US lobby group, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The CFR is an elite US foreign policy thinktank, and the Arab Reform Initiative is described on its website as a &quot;CFR Project&quot; . More specifically, the ARI was initiated by a group within the CFR called the &quot;US/Middle East Project&quot; – a body of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers, the stated aim of which is to undertake regional &quot;policy analysis&quot; in order &quot;to prevent conflict and promote stability&quot;. The US/Middle East Project pursues these goals under the guidance of an international board chaired by General (Ret.) Brent Scowcroft.&quot;</p>

<p>Read the full article for the greater context. Its astonishing how a small, well organised group of people can start a war in a country. You get the whole gang mentioned in this article from Kissinger to Richard Perle and William Kristol and more of the same people you see when you actually look into things.</p>

<p>Who cares that Chomsky doesn&#39;t agree with you on 1 thing, get over it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually agree with Chomsky on 9/11 on conspiracy theories in general. His dismissal of 9/11 theories is actually quite eloquent in both reasons and consequences. It comes down to scientific illiteracy of the people involved in disseminating these theories. </p>

<p>We can look at WTC 7 youtube videos for minute details that we can&#39;t explain (and once one is explained, just move on to the next one). All the while even if we replicated the whole thing as a <em>controlled experiment we would not be able to explain everything</em>.</p>

<p>Which is the case of any empirical experiments of complex enough phenomena. Why do you think people still have to fling cars at concrete obstacles at 40 mph to find out what happens to them? And now people expect a much more complex aircraft strike at a building to be explained completely?</p>

<p>If 9/11 was a government op, Chomsky would be the first to say so. He&#39;s devoted a large portion of his life to uncover what kind of evil stuff the US operations have done. </p>
