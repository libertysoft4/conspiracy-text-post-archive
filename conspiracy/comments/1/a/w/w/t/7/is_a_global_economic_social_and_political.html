    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the deleveraging part. Canadian household debt hits a new record high every time it is measured. The fact that there is a slowing of household debt has been spun as a deleveraging but it just means debt is accumulating more slowly. If I make $50,000 per year and instead of spending $60,000 in a year I spend $59,000, I&#39;ve slowed my debtload but I&#39;m still spending more than I make...a downward spiral at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly not to the extent your government has done. As for macroeconomic models, I would suggest reading Steven Keen&#39;s book, Debunking Economics, that does an excellent job of showing how these models are wrong; or, Nasim Taleb&#39;s book, The Black Swan, that shows economics is NOT a science where statistical models can be used, but a social science dependent more on human emotion and a herd mentality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you basing your assertion on? Mathematical trends? Taleb provides a great parable about a turkey, who for a thousand days adheres to the belief that his caretaker, the farmer, is nurturing...at least right up until a few days before Thanksgiving. All of that turkey&#39;s experience would lead him to believe that every day would bring another wonderful day of free food and shelter, until the black swan event of the farmer&#39;s hatchet to his neck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I&#39;d have to disagree that I&#39;m advocating a perverse solipsism (this is the correct spelling, I had to look up the word;). I believe that we&#39;re dealing with an extremely complex system with various feedback loops that can never be mathematically-modelled. Second, I&#39;m wondering what wonderful model(s) you would be referring to. I would assume that the Federal Reserve has access to the best economic models going. However, that bastion of PhDs seems to know little about how real world economics works; Ben Bernanke asserted again and again that there was no housing bubble, that the market was acting according to models, and that house prices had never fallen and would not fall. Yet, here the U.S. stands in the shadow of a burst housing bubble and probably on the verge of a credit bubble collapse...at least according to Peter Schiff and others who also warned about a housing bubble while everyone else laughed at their warnings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you&#39;re wrong that &quot;everyone laughed at their warnings.&quot; Major economists and publications and even ruler of all that is wicked and evil Paul Krugman predicted the housing bubble. Indeed, minutes of the FOMC showed that they knew about the housing bubble. However, this is a tangent to the actual point which I do not want to delve into. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m talking about macroeconomic models, like the IS-LM model that led textbook macro analysis t be correct on the direction of inflation and bond rates after the recession, when people like the aforementioned Peter Schiff were dead, dead wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While we can never be sure when &#39;collapse&#39; may occur for our global system, there is plenty of evidence, both historical and prehistorical, to show that societies rise and fall. The &#39;fall&#39; or &#39;collapse&#39; is sometimes a slow-moving train wreck or a sudden, all-encompassing disaster, resulting in most members succumbing to disease, intruders, starvation, etc.. 
The concern I have is that our global system is so intertwined and dependent on other complex subsystems that collapse of one seemingly innocuous part may create a domino effect that washes across the globe. It would appear that the tipping point may be coming in the form of an economic collapse that radiates out into other subsystems, resulting in mass starvation (how many in the West would know how to feed themselves?)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly not to the extent your government has done. As for macroeconomic models, I would suggest reading Steven Keen&#39;s book, Debunking Economics, that does an excellent job of showing how these models are wrong; or, Nasim Taleb&#39;s book, The Black Swan, that shows economics is NOT a science where statistical models can be used, but a social science dependent more on human emotion and a herd mentality.</p>
