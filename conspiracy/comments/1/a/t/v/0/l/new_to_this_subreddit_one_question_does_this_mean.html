<p>There is indeed a lot of hidden, covert, nefarious shit going on in this world.  That much is absolutely, indubitably true.  There are <em>many</em> levels of understanding with regard to just how aware one is of what exactly is going on, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m trying to be continuously difficult here, but what I said above applies to this statement as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that someone who votes and pays their taxes and punches in and out at a 9-5 and has 2.5 kids and a spouse, sits down and watches the MSM drivel but doesn&#39;t &quot;believe <em>all</em> of it&quot; could be said to have a &quot;decent understanding of how the world is run&quot;.</p>

<p>That person is, however, practically &quot;completely oblivious&quot; compared to, say, G. Edward Griffin or someone like Jordan Maxwell to use but two examples.</p>

<p>As I imagine some replies on here have already mentioned, some on this subreddit <em>are</em> indeed quite a bit more awake than the average person.  Others in this subreddit not so much.</p>

<p>Overall it would seem that there are at least more people than average on this subreddit that at least know &quot;something&quot; is terribly awry, and that is at least a start.</p>

<p>That really makes me sigh and give a beleaguered facepalm because there <em>are</em> indeed people that are <em>that</em> oblivious to just how bad things are...and yet things are SOOO fucking bad.  I wonder just how anyone could be <em>that</em> clueless....but I guess some are, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the folks here <em>are</em> generally much more awake than the average person...but even we still have a <em>lot</em> more work to do and a LOT more to study and be aware of because the rabbit hole goes <em>way</em> deeper than TPTB have revealed to any of us proles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There really aren&#39;t many people spouting the 4th dimensional reptilian theory in this subreddit. For every one that does there are 10 that decry him. The subreddit is actually far from homogeneous, and has a pretty steady influx of status quo believers flooding in from r/conspiritard to keep discussions lively. There are a few folks who believe that Jews are the great evil, but once again, not the majority.</p>

<p>The main problem I see with the sub is that a lot of wide eyed hysteria pops in and gets upvoted when something is big in the media like Sandy Hook. All kinds of rumors and speculation get bandied about and parroted that are quite absurd. Then when really bizarre claims are made people who believe it and the rational folks who are seeing the obvious lies start infighting fests that turn into paranoid rage fits and name calling. The percentage split of the BS as a result of useful idiots, controlled opposition and government/corporate infiltration is anyone&#39;s guess.  All the while the fixation on the big event that the media is talking about furthers the whole goal of The Powers That Be who had the big media circus to distract from &quot;something else&quot; in the first place. So there are those drawbacks. </p>

<p>But still, there&#39;s a lot of good wheat amongst the chaff and quite a bit of awareness of issues that one won&#39;t find in the typical paradigm left/right forums on the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There really aren&#39;t many people spouting the 4th dimensional reptilian theory in this subreddit. For every one that does there are 10 that decry him. The subreddit is actually far from homogeneous, and has a pretty steady influx of status quo believers flooding in from r/conspiritard to keep discussions lively. There are a few folks who believe that Jews are the great evil, but once again, not the majority.</p>

<p>The main problem I see with the sub is that a lot of wide eyed hysteria pops in and gets upvoted when something is big in the media like Sandy Hook. All kinds of rumors and speculation get bandied about and parroted that are quite absurd. Then when really bizarre claims are made people who believe it and the rational folks who are seeing the obvious lies start infighting fests that turn into paranoid rage fits and name calling. The percentage split of the BS as a result of useful idiots, controlled opposition and government/corporate infiltration is anyone&#39;s guess.  All the while the fixation on the big event that the media is talking about furthers the whole goal of The Powers That Be who had the big media circus to distract from &quot;something else&quot; in the first place. So there are those drawbacks. </p>

<p>But still, there&#39;s a lot of good wheat amongst the chaff and quite a bit of awareness of issues that one won&#39;t find in the typical paradigm left/right forums on the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you mean this sub not the whole site, and what do you hate? The utter lunacy of this subreddit, or the fact that there are peole who don&#39;t blindly listen to evrything they see.</p>
