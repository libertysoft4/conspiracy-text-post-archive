    <div class="md"><p>Private physical ownership of precious metals as an investment is poo-poo&#39;d by investment firms because they can&#39;t make money off of it. Had you given them your money then they would have made money on fees, commissions and reinvestments.</p>

<p>Precious metals are much easier for Joe Blow to deal with and middlemen aren&#39;t needed. As with any other investment, you buy the dips and sell the tips (if you&#39;re actively buying and selling rather than just sitting on it). If you&#39;re going through a dealer then you expect a +/- X% of melt value. You&#39;d buy from him at +X% and sell to him at -X%. Private deals are whatever terms are agreed upon. It&#39;s that easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Private direct deals are probably a bit difficult to arrange at this moment but I believe that they will be actually preferred within the next decade.</p>

<p>As an experiment one time I offerred someone either $60 or $65 (at the time) in two silver eagles and they chose the silver.  Its all abstract but when you give even the uninitiated an option in their face then things can change quickly.</p>

<p>They will likely hoard those two silver coins and spend all of the worthless cash that they acquire.  When people feel the metal they know that they have something of substance, something worth holding onto.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember the silver bubble from a few years ago.  It got up to $40, everyone said &quot;It&#39;s going to reach $50 and keep going!&quot;  I cashed out at 40, made a bunch of money, bought this computer and watched silver drop like a rock the next day.</p>

<p>The only people interested in getting you to buy precious metals are the people holding large quantities of precious metals.  I guess that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make money off of them though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that gold could drop 5% from here at most and silver could drop 15% or so still.  The upside though is immense and for silver is 50-150%.  I&#39;ve been on this path for over a decade now when I learned of the conspiracy to crash the economy.  I&#39;m just so much more fucking right than assholes that I spoke to back then so I&#39;m in for the distance.  Also I don&#39;t have anything to spend that money on now anyways so I don&#39;t need the stress of having the think about arbitrary confiscation of anything.  Silver and gold will vastly outperform US stocks although of course there is vastly more potential for profit and also disaster by flipping assets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WHat do you do with your money? Spend it.  Seriously, that&#39;s what capitalism is all about.  Too many people holding onto money instead of using it for its intended purpose can ruin an economy.  I&#39;m not saying you should waste it but sometimes you can spend it as an investment.  Invest in your own business.  Improve your home to add value.  Buy something which would increase your own productivity or might decrease your expenses like new insulation in a home.  This whole idea that money should be hoarded away is not only wrong but is not what rich people do with their money.  They purchase established and profitable businesses, they invest in certain thigs which bring a return.  This difference in mindset is one of the key differences between the two classes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think that getting back into silver gets better by the day.  The price has stagnated for a while allowing the long curve to catch up.  People are not on about silver at the moment even though shit is going down like the Cypress shenanigans.  I think though that there is still a bit of time for it to go sideways before it explodes upwards.  The silver price can be highly volatile and it will not rise slowly.  Personally I would get in now if I had a chunk of cash, although I could just wait since I believe that the price will go sideways for 3-6 months more around the same price.  The upside is tremendous and the downside is minimal.</p>

For example, at this very moment it has underperformed in the last few years.  I was recently talking with someone who says that for the long term it is all about stocks.  I said but over the last ten years it has vastly outperformed stocks and he said oh yeah well what has it done in the last few years.  People love them their stocks.

Here&#39;s some bullish gold commentary in the Wall Street Journal
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323316804578161230254371890.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323316804578161230254371890.html</a>

    <div class="md"><p>I am afraid I do not regard Jim Cramer as a serious financial journalist - he is a pump and dump merchant and here he is touting the SPDR gold trust (GLD) which many people in the &quot;gold community&quot; regard as a massive scam. By gold, I mean physical gold, not paper ponzis like GLD.</p>

<p>The WSJ article is about actually about the disconnect between the gold price and gold mining shares, which the article argues may be undervalued. </p>

<p>What I said may appear to be hyperbole, but you will have to look much harder to find a genuine buy recommendation for gold from a serious financial publication.</p>

Not sure why you would want a Fortune magazine saying &quot;buy gold.&quot; That&#39;d be the surest sign at that point to sell. </p>
