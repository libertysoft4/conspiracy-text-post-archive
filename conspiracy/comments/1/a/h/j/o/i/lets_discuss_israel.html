    <div class="md"><p>That aggression is very much perpetuated by their actions, though.</p>

<p>I do think some people put <em>way</em> too much weight into the Israel argument though. It&#39;s clear that they&#39;re a big issue, and that their influence in the world certainly isn&#39;t a positive one, but it seems like some people make out that they&#39;re the single root of all the world&#39;s problems...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From every indicator i&#39;ve seen, when they start ramping up the pressure on Iran to the point where it&#39;s obvious a military force is going to be involved on foreign soil (doesn&#39;t matter whose), it&#39;s time to start battening down the hatches.</p>

<p>Literally the best we can hope for now, from what i&#39;ve seen, is that the fucking sociopaths that are in charge don&#39;t start a large-scale nuclear war. Because then we&#39;re all utterly fucked.</p>

<p>What is happening is that the economy/energy systems are completely collapsing. If allowed to run it&#39;s course, the people in power will lose everything, along with the rest of us, and we&#39;ll rebuild (eventually) from there. They&#39;re not going to let that happen without clinging tooth and nail to whatever they have left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re buying their bullshit dude. Communism is no more evil than capitalism or any other &#39;ism. Why? Because all the people at the top are corrupt anyway. There is no such thing as &quot;freedom&quot; in this current system. One of the best quotes i&#39;ve ever seen was this: <em>&#39;There are none more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.&#39;</em></p>

<p>Capitalism itself isn&#39;t even inherently <em>more</em> &#39;free&#39; than any other economic template; you&#39;re still forced into working whether you like it or not, you just happen to believe you&#39;re working for yourself rather than others, which is utterly false. It&#39;s fucking brilliance if you think about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know enough about it to make a call on that. I personally think if certain groups can stay out of each others&#39; way and not get violent, then yeah, i suppose it&#39;s viable for a while, but there are just too many people on the planet for that to work for any length of time. What it would essentially turn into is small-scale resource-based economies, because people would have to live off whatever resources they could farm/produce themselves within their small communities. </p>

<p>Carrying on from that, i think a resource-based economy would be the best viable option. It certainly has it&#39;s flaws, but i haven&#39;t seen a better or more sustainable idea. People bring up issues about it being essentially NWO and Agenda 21 etc, but they&#39;re thinking within the realms of the current system. If world leaders came out next week and told us a resource-based economy was the way to go, i&#39;d tell them to fuck themselves, because they&#39;re the same cunts who have got us to this position so far. Nobody would trust them, and rightly so. However, if you completely disregard the current system, and tried to use the concept of a RBE to figure out what is best for the continued sustainability of the planet and the human species, then we&#39;d have real progress, economically, socially, technologically, you name it.</p>

<p>Do i see that sort of change happening within our lifetime? Fuck no. The best i can dream about is trying to put people on the right track for the future once this current system goes south. Which it inevitably will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anarchism doesn&#39;t really exist on this planet.  The only real extent toward which it does might, perhaps, be seen is in those people that live on their own in the woods, or those societies that have been found living deep in the forest somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things have changed a fair bit since then. I know the neighbors aren&#39;t exactly friendly, but they&#39;ve gone <em>way</em> past the point of defense these days; it&#39;s become oppression, plain and simple.</p>

<p>The way the whole place was setup in the first place, it was bound to end up like this. You can&#39;t just reclaim land that wasn&#39;t yours for hundreds of years based on the writings of an ancient fairytale. In all honesty i think it&#39;s a shitty situation on both ends, and someone was bound to get fucked over from the beginning; it just so happened that someone was the Palestinians. Good ol&#39; religion doing what it does best, as usual.</p>

<p>Although this is sort of besides the point when talking about their current influence in US politics etc. That&#39;s a subject i know even less about than the Israeli state itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If one wants to compare the world&#39;s problems to a football franchise, I personally would look at Israel as the teams star quarterback.  To most people looking at things this way, the star quarterback <em>is</em> the team.</p>

<p>To those that <em>really</em> know what&#39;s going on, however, they realize that even though Israel might be one of the biggest movers <em>on the field</em>, the REAL movers are the team owners that call the shots.</p>

<p>Perhaps people like Christian Noyer - the Chairman of The Bank for International Settlements (making him the head of the <em>central banks&#39;</em> bank, kind of the <em>real</em> financial ruler of the world) - might be closer to the <em>owner</em> of the team, if you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, pal.  I&#39;m not asking this so I can start a fight; I&#39;m asking because I want a variety of information and real communication with others.  I can ask you guys questions and give input, etc.  I understand that Israel seems to be an area of concern/issue in the world today and I would just like to hear why from my fellow man/woman.</p>

<p>Why is Israel considered to be evil by so many? </p>

<p>They do many evil things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do so many people say our taxes go to Israel? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because your taxes <em>do</em> go to Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are the Rothschilds at all related to Israel? </p>

<p>Learn how to Google.</p>

<p>I keep up with all other aspects of the REAL world today (The Fed, Rothschilds, NK, internal corruption, 2nd Amendment, etc.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think you keep up to date on problems from the &quot;REAL&quot; world but claim ignorance of Israel, then you obviously are fucking clueless about the real problems in the &quot;REAL&quot; world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is one thing that confuses me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jewish lobby groups, and dual Israel-American citizens who hold positions of power, do everything they can to make Americans support Israel and their Zionist agenda.  Evangelical Christian idiots also support these groups, and much of their money also goes to funding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.  That&#39;s the real problem: the christian idiots who support Israeli terrorism and colonialism.</p>

<p>The problem is not Jewish people.  Don&#39;t confuse &quot;Israeli&quot; with &quot;Jewish&quot;, and certainly don&#39;t confuse &quot;Jewish&quot; with &quot;Zionist&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for this brief explanation.  Jeez, I only asked because I&#39;m pretty ill-informed and I figured some of my fellow Redditors may be able to clarify.  I&#39;m not sure why he&#39;s being so short but it&#39;s all good, I appreciated his input in any case.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell: 
Zionists are, in general, the corrupt elite like the Rothschilds?<br/>
While Jewish people are essentially harmless Jewish people?<br/>
Therefore, Zionist should never be used interchangeably with Jewish, as many everyday Jews are against the corruption displayed by the Zionists?</p>

<p>We can&#39;t <em>all</em> know <em>everything</em> guys, that&#39;s why this sub exists in the fucking first place.

    <div class="md"><p>I think self evaluation is an essential thing for anyone reading up about these subjects. There is <em>so</em> much bullshit out there, it&#39;s overwhelming at times, and no matter how hard any of us try, we&#39;re going to get tripped up, be it with disinfo or anything else. Not to mention the ridiculous paranoia you get from wondering which sources are disinfo and which aren&#39;t... can&#39;t keep up haha.</p>

<p>I think taking a step back and trying to look at the global picture is the best thing we can all try to do. It&#39;s a huge and complicated game of join the dots, and i think a lot of people get too caught up with the details. A good example would be the DHS ammo/AMRAP debate - would it be alarming if the theories on here were correct? Absolutely. Is it a game-changer if they&#39;re not? No way - it doesn&#39;t alter the overall state of global affairs.</p>
