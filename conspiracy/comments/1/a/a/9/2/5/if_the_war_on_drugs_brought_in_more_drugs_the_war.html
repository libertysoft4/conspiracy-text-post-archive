<p>What we need is more consciousness and understanding. This way we can eliminate all &quot;jobs&quot; with negative effects, and replace them with work that actually contributes to this world. Eliminate this wrong idea of money making and acquisition of ever increasing amounts of material goods. Things will be a lot better and people will have much more free time, all that while eliminating practically all other problems we have such as poverty, etc.</p>

<p>Food, water, and shelter.</p>

<p>We were able to accomplish those things no problem hundreds of years ago with the technology of the time. We&#39;re loads more efficient now and - we spend <em>more</em> time at work! We eat <em>shittier</em> food! We have <em>smaller</em> homes!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Hundreds of years ago, aquiring these things took 12-14 hours of your day and a lot of back-breaking labor. The quality of each of those things were poor and meager. Inreasing the quality and decreasing the labor involved a lot of specialization and the people who performed those tasks required even more. So while it is disconnected, it has also increased our lifespan and given the average person the ability to do things that were reserved for the very wealthy.</p>

<p>We have drastically larger homes. 18th century homes averaged 450 sq-ft. By the early 20th century, they only increased to 700 sq-ft. Our homes today are 5 times larger than the 18th century. The houses you see remaining are there because of historical significance or because they were grand for their times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is quite possibly the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.  If you think you can get food, water, and shelter, in ten hours a week, I encourage you to move out to the country and give that a try.  The only way this would be possible is with an infinite source of energy and machines to do all the work.  Building all of that is never going to happen, and if it did, it would take more than ten hours a week.</p>

<p>As someone who grows the food you eat, I feel as though I probably have more insight into this situation than you.  All the farmers I know put in 60 to 80 hour work weeks.  This includes organic farmers, and factory farmers.  Making food is hard work.  Living is hard work.  If the infrastructure around me ever collapses and I have to be self-sufficient, I&#39;ll be working far more than 80 hours in a week, I can tell you that much for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be that extreme conspiracist, but my views have evolved over a very long time. I completely agree with what you are saying and I say take it a step further. We don&#39;t need jobs, we don&#39;t need money. It is the motivating factor yes, but without it we could have people with the real passion and talent rise to the top of their professions. We dont need jobs to live. We have technology that can help us live. Plenty of autonomous robotics to do the repetitive tasks that many of us do to feed ourselves. Should we still do these tasks? If we wish, but it should be a choice, not a necessity. I have always wanted to spark change that could revolutionize humanity for the better, but realise we are rebellious infants in which change can be difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, we do not need jobs and money at all. We can go another step further and even robotic devices can be replaced with technology that is a lot more effective in every way, to do things which are currently thought to be impossible.</p>

<p>All the &quot;work&quot; we do will be on a voluntary basis, and we will actually enjoy it because it will be a positive act based on free will and cooperation, and instead of a trivial repetitive task everyone decides his/her own unique contribution.</p>

<p>We could go even further by a lot, but taking enormous steps like that can be difficult for many people who aren&#39;t quite ready for it, so for those it is better we take the smaller steps first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Central banks have been engaging in Quantitative Easing pretty much since the 2008 financial crisis. So a lot of money is being printed. All this printing has kept interest rates low, so that it is more attractive to take a loan and make an investment, at the expense of pensioners and those with savings accounts.</p>

<p>What has this printing of money done? Interestingly it has shot up the price of gold, and many Central banks have increasing their gold reserves.</p>

It is NOT hard to grow coca leaves or cannabis commercially. The biggest issue is doing it without interuption from the federal government.</p>

<p>We want jobs. We want more resources for our communities. Legalize drugs and use the tax money to pay to assist addicts. Simple. Everything else can go to education and harm reduction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing the point. Whether or not the governments decision to criminalize drugs has brought in MORE drugs is NOT the point our friend is making. making them illegal has created an unregulated market for them, and as was previously stated, makes it so that the hardrr drugs are more valuable. the fact that there is so much money to be made is what keeps the cartels/gangs in the business. its not the drugs its the money. Money is always the root of the problem</p>

    <div class="md"><p>by banning drugs you make a highly lucrative and unregulated black market, which in turns encourages people to sell drugs. this is especially true with organized criminal groups. we saw it with the mafia in prohibition and we are seeing it now with the gangs and the cartels. </p>

<p>by banning drugs you also encourage the manufacture and distribution of harder drugs, because harder drugs are more effective by weight, allowing a smuggler to make more profit for the same relative risk. </p>

<p>also, making all drugs illegal means that people must by softer drugs from drug dealers, drug dealers who are likely to encourage them to try the harder stuff, because,  as i have pointed out, they yield a higher profit to risk ratio, as well as higher and harder to break addiction rates, helping to further secure their customer base.</p>

<p>another point, making drugs illegal creates a taboo for  all the teens out their looking to be rebellious.</p>

<p>history has shown that prohibiting a substance only serves to further its proliferation. we saw this in the american prohibition of alcohol , and we are seeing the good that can be achieved once prohibition is undone, like in Portugal and amsterdam, two places where drug use and crime has gone down considerably.</p>

Admissions to state mental hospitals for alcoholic psychosis declined from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1919 to 4.7 in 1928.Arrests for public drunkennness and disorderly conduct declined 50 percent between 1916 and 1922.
