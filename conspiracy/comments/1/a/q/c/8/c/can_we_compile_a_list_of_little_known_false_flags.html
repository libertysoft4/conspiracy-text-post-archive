    <div class="md"><p>The USS Liberty was a big one. Also, the sinking of the Maine to start the Spanish-American war. A lot of things were &quot;allowed to happen&quot;. For example, there is truth to the claim that the most formidable part of our Pacific fleet was away from Pearl Harbor on the day of the attack. We knew the Lusitania was travelling through hostile waters in WW1. It sank. We went to war promoting the cause with pictures of this ship. Remember the Alamo?? I could go on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Alamo was DEFINITELY not appropriate to put on that list.</p>

<p>First of all, the war had started; this is simply a battle.</p>

<p>Second of all, it wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed to happen.&quot; It is true that they knew it was going to be a horrible defeat, but Sam Houston, the commander of the forces, was far away and his command to abandon the fort went unfollowed. </p>

<p>The men at the Alamo knew they were going to be killed but decided to stay and fight anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;Remember the Alamo&quot;  was then used as a battle cry not only to inspire the same fearlessness that the Alamo fighters had, but also to remind the Texans of the slaughter that the Mexicans committed, leaving no man alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it isn&#39;t in the same category. It was sort of a joke, but, like everything else, the event did get clouded through the blurriness of history. I&#39;ve read a theory that made sense that the order to not reinforce the fort was given knowing that the sacrifice would further insight the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Texan, it is my solemn duty to speak at lengths about Texas history whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>I would say your theory probably has some merit, but rather than some commander dooming his people to die, I prefer to believe that these men disobeyed authority in order to martyr themselves, indeed to &quot;further insight the people.&quot;</p>

<p>The Revolution was in such a sorry state at that point, Houston didn&#39;t think the causalities  necessary to maintain the Alamo was worth it; he would have much rather abandoned the mission and consolidated his troop elsewhere.  Unfortunately, many of the Alamo defenders like Boone and Crockett were looking for a cause to die for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jim Bowie was a slave trader. There&#39;s nothing badass about that. In fact for the most part the texas revolutionaries were a group of former mercenaries and indian killers looking to cash in on a land grab and set up farms and crops propped up by slave labor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WACO (!), Fast and Furious (False Flag?), Operation Gladio (CIA importing drugs to the ghetto to fund the contras), Hitler (and the nazi party) burning the Reichstag (german parliament) which led the move to make Hitler Chancellor (leader), Al Queda (Created by the US).  Please follow this link to get a high level look at the history of False Flags: <a href="http://www.takeoverworld.info/false-flag.html">LINK</a>  (good starting point)</p>

<p>By the way, I truly commend you for what you are saying you would like to do (make a short doc on this subject).  I have been writing some articles/blogs furiously over the past couple of days.  I think this is what needs to happen and it makes me so happy to see it happening in r/conspiracy as this place is filled with amazing people! …and government shills… </p>

<p>I’d love to see more analysis and content creation (videos, articles, pictures, infographics) from the other readers of r/conspiracy.  That would truly tip the scales and make this subreddit a very powerful think tank that may actually be able to wake more minds to the truth and/or possibilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome! Let me know when you post your vid and I’ll definitely be sure to check it out and pass it along to any and all who may want to take a look…or may NEED to take a look as they’ve never heard of “False Flag” before.  </p>

<p>It’s interesting that you bring up false flag attacks as one of my articles is about the 4 possibilities of what happened this week in Syria.  1.   No chemical weapons were used by either side 2. Rebels used chemical weapons  3.  Assad’s forces used Chem Weapons  4.  False flag by any NUMBER of countries…but mainly the US, Britian, or Russia (my guesses based on attitudes of the countries and proximity to the country’s uprising).  </p>

<p>With both the rebels and Assad denying responsibility and claiming the other side used the chemical weapons, we now are FORCED to consider that maybe they are both telling the truth and maybe it was neither of the fighting forces but an external force using the weapons to push an agenda.  </p>

<p>Keep an eye out for some of my writings.  I’ll try to post something tonight.  </p>

They need our protection so they need to keep the heat up on us there. Al Juba killed like 200 marines using a rafael defense prototype sniper rifle. The liberty was to be intentionally sunk but they failed. The cole was put out of commission by a suicide bomber that should have been fired upon by the phalanx but that was disabled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t have a concrete opinion on the recent mass shootings, however, i think it is clear that these events are being used specifically to discuss gun laws.. That in itself is a red flag for me, as these shooters are all on psychotropic drugs.  (if these shootings were legit,  i believe it&#39;s the meds to blame) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay then going off your premise they he was a lone nut. Please answer some very simple basic questions. 1. What happened to the two suspects in the woods that were arrested? Names, charges, why were they there. 2. 2 to 4 handguns found in school depending on who you listen too, AR found in trunk of car. Yet medical examiner says all victims shot by AR. 3. How did the Medical Examiner autopsy 20 victims in less than 24 hours? Never heard of before. 4. Why did CNN, and other media show a drill as actual footage of Sandy Hook. 5. Why were all medical personnel, ambulances, firetrucks, police located a mile from Sandy Hook.5. Why had no one seen Adam Lanza in 3 years? 6. Why did Adam have his brothers ID, when his brother stated many times he had no contact in with him for a very long time. These are just some simple basic questions. Answer these simple question, plus A LOT more, and then we will stop thinking its a conspiracy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I should have mentioned. This arose from me discovering the documented proof of the Northwoods Operation, I was blown away when I read the documents online on .GOV websites. I want others to be able to research the examples I use. 9/11 is tempting but I cant say I have proof of a false flag so I will leave that one out. Thanks</p>
