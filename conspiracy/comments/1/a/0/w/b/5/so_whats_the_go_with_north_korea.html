    <div class="md"><p>NK is pissed off because the sanctions. The sanctions make the situation for the NK government harder. So, the are threatening the US/SK with attack in the hope to get some sort of a deal. We will not attack if you give us oil/food/Dennis Rodman/Paris Hilton/whatever. Basically, their situation is very weak because they have less support as China has been joined to the hip of the US and can&#39;t afford to piss off the US by supporting NK. The Chinese have a lot of cheap plastic party hats that they want to sell and no other buyers than the US. So, NK is basically fucked. A side problem is that the new leader Kim is very young and may try to play chicken with the US/Obama which would not work because war would be DOD&#39;s dream come true....</p>

<p>The US would not attack NK unless they did something that jusified an attack that China could not stand behind (China has already extremely distanced themselves from NK). There would be no world war, no one would fight with North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this hypothetical scenario, NK has a nuclear weapon that it intends to disguise inside a cargo freighter and launch from the pacific ocean, this rocket would be designed to carry 2 explosive components, one being a nuclear (no warhead necessary) and the other is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse#E2">E2/E3 component</a>. Detonated 300 miles above the US it would disrupt and disable all electronic devices that were not shielded (shielded refers to military targets or infrastructure designed to withstand lightning strikes).</p>

<p>This would cripple the US but not completely, but coupled with a well executed initial cyber attack, it could potentially disable the US.</p>

<p>NK doesn&#39;t have the capability to secure the US, but it can secure SK if the US is K.O. and without infrastructure many US citizens will die from hunger and exposure.</p>

<p>This hypothetical scenario is contingent on some factors that are unknown, such as China&#39;s participation in the cyber attack (it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be China, however they seem to the the top contenders), and the capability of NK to actually pull it off.</p>

<p>Countries will step in to fill the power vacuum left by the United States.</p>

<p>The US has NK under such vigilant surveillance so it IS unlikely something could happen. Happy?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It goes beyond worst-case and into impossible-case.</p>

<p>For example, the attack you speculated requires NK to drive a container cargo vessel within range of the U.S.  On the surface, using a container cargo vessel sounds pretty sneaky...</p>

<p>In actuality, the sanctions against NK mean that there is no reason for any ship to travel from NK to North America, whether cargo container, bulk cargo, passenger, or military.  Any ship approach North America from NK would be extremely irregular.  The U.S. DoD tracks every boat in the world.  The North Koreans are not going to sneak a vessel halfway across the Pacific, much less most of the way across.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, their puny little warheads wouldn&#39;t cause much of an EMP even if they could deliver them.</p>

<p>VASTLY more likely is a rowboat-based attack on Seoul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no doubt of that, the US has nukes stationed strategically and secretly around the world, and possibly even in space (on board the x37-b for example) a space plane currently unmanned and on a classified air force mission. It wouldn&#39;t take much for it to accelerate a nuke up to meteorite speeds since it&#39;s already in orbit. And hopefully the nuclear weapons based in foreign countries could still be used in the event of an EMP blackout. Feels weird to say, &quot;hope they can use the nukes&quot; but seriously, fuck em&#39; they&#39;re the enemy, it just sucks the US has so many enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say a well-shielded nuke is the size of a car.  By well-shielded I mean that it&#39;s not remotely detectable.  Now get NK to smuggle that thing using their submarines, which are reported to have a range of 2000 kms or so.  Rendez-vous in the middle of the ocean with a ship sailing under a random flag and transfer the payload.  Ship is manned by a crew working for a South American drug cartel.</p>

<p>They think it&#39;s a standard drug or arms payload.  They bring that to South America and transfer it to a submarine of their own, and from there to North America.  Payload is then transferred to a safe house in some big US city (e.g. Washington, DC) where additional shielding is installed around the payload (since a stationary source is easier to detect) in the form of lead bricks or lead-enriched cement, borax, water, etc.</p>

<p>Payload uses WiFi to check, say, <a href="/r/pyongyang">/r/pyongyang</a> daily and if there is a cute cat post containing encrypted instructions, it sets itself into countdown mode and sends a confirmation.  Which should have occurred a few days ago, hence the threat by Kim.</p>

<p>In a few hours, the low-yield, low-tech nuke goes off in Washington.  Since it&#39;s detonated at or close to ground level, the casualties are low, but since it&#39;s a plutonium nuke, the fallout is nasty.  Welcome to the future.
Now the media can try to blame it on al-Qaeda or the terrorist organization <em>du jour</em> but since Kim has given time, location &amp; method in advance this isn&#39;t very credible.</p>

<p>Of course, if the US agrees to Kim&#39;s conditions... then nothing happens and it&#39;s &quot;just saber-rattling&quot;... except that Kim gets a few $1e8-1e9 richer.</p>

<p>TPTB want to establish central bank there, just like in Libya... It is part of the long term plan to create this thing called &quot; world government &quot;. For them to create world government they have to control all central banks. If you do not control all banks then you can not have world government.</p>

<p>This is all propaganda campaign to start a war and influence public opinion. It is just N. Korea turn.</p>

<p>BTW..when they finish with other country&#39;s on the list they will come for anybody who is opposing them. Or, who they perceive could oppose them</p>

<p>No, I am saying that if you can not buy food for people then they starve. And you can not buy food if you are under economic sanctions. Under economic sanctions there is no trade..that is the point of economic sanctions.</p>

<p>Wealth is dependent on culture. Debt is not wealth to everybody. By some you would be considered poor. And very unsuccessful if you have people living on the street and on welfare. But, it is personal opinion...not objective in any case.</p>

<p>I think this quote is appropriate here</p>

<p><em>Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who&#39;ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables – slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don&#39;t need. We&#39;re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We&#39;ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we&#39;d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won&#39;t. We&#39;re slowly learning that fact. And we&#39;re very, very pissed off.</em></p>

<p>You are some kind of book critic ? You do not like their style of writing ?</p>

<p><em>Literary criticism is the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature. Modern literary criticism is often informed by literary theory, which is the philosophical discussion of its methods and goals. Though the two activities are closely related, literary critics are not always, and have not always been, theorists.</em></p>

<p>you are structural engineer ?</p>

<p><em>Structural engineering is a field of engineering dealing with the analysis and design of structures that support or resist loads. Structural engineering is usually considered a specialty within civil engineering, but it can also be studied in its own right</em></p>

<p>You know... U.S. is only country in the world that has skyscrapers collapsing by them self </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has all been worked out behind the scenes. NK is in it economic, social death throws, they want to get out from under all the sanctions that are crippling them. Like Myanmar have recently. But NK still have a major role to play in a charade.</p>

<p>NK are nuclear equipped. They may want to give up voluntarily nukes, but that is not what is required. So they are beating the drums of war, threatening western aligned neighbours and the US with nuclear annihilation, starting up their mothballed reactors capable of producing nuke bomb material. All that is needed now is some action that will trigger, most likely the South Koreans with some US support, to launch strikes against the North Korean nuke facilities, maybe even after they have, say, launch a missile in the direction of SK. Once the nukes are wiped out, NK will basically give in to demands, sign a treaty etc. in order save some face and open up for aid, food and developmentally then do an East Germany.</p>

<p>Why all this charade? <strong>With the precedent set of disarming a minor nuclear power, set with use of military action, before they can use their nukes against an enemy, it makes it now so much easier for Israel and the US to do the same against Iran. If the Chinese allow NK to be disarmed, this way, it makes it harder for the Russians to stand up for Iran also.</strong></p>
