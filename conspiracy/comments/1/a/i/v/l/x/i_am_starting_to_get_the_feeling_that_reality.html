        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of the current &quot;reality&quot; shows portray the common person in a negative way. (redneck, stupid, greedy, drunk/drugs, selfish, vain, foolish, etc.) While police, military, Coast Guard, fire/rescue are portrayed as heroic, brave, intelligent. </p>

<p>I believe that &quot;they&quot; want us to hate, mistrust, fear our fellow citizen and respect the authorities in order to weaken our ability to band together and resist the coming police state. </p>

<p>Watching these miserable people gives many viewers a feeling of superiority. They feels smarter, more organized and morally superior. Instead to go out, they spend even more time before their TV screens. They waste their time by comparing themselves to those vapid people on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s something else, a thought I had the other day that is relevant to your point. I dont know where the majority of you guys are from, I tend to just assume everyone is from the U.S. until I learn otherwise, but here in the U.K. we are currently having polls on facebook over what the new flavour of kitkat should be (a chocolate bar - the TV adverts about it are full of people dressed as the different flavours made up like superheroes) - when I click on the comments I see grown adults arguing over it. I dont remember my parents doing anything like this (I&#39;m 28 now so let&#39;s say 20 years ago). They wouldn&#39;t sit for hours staring at cat videos, they wouldn&#39;t vote on the new flavour of kit kat, not because we didnt have internet/facebook, but because they were f**king adults and this sort of thing is for kids. </p>

<p>We also have people obsessing over a dancing pony on an advert (commercial). In the last 20 years we have gone from responsible, sensible people into a nation of simpering fools that just want to be involved in fads and roaming the earth desperate to witness something they can upload on to social media rather than having any meaningful social interactions and protesting the latest string of illegal wars or revoked liberties and rights. </p>

<p>If you can make any sense of that garbled nonsense then you are more a man than I. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh god help us all I think you are right. I think that governments worlwide realize that wars against one another are too destructive and expensive, and what they all have in common is they all want to control their people. So they are working together against the people, to subjugate all of us. The mass obsession with iThings and reality TV is a symptom of people going insane from what they subconsciously (or rarely consciously) know about what is happening to their world. It is too overwhelming and they need something to fixate on so it does not cause them to go insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are totally right.  It&#39;s as though a the masses are suffering from arrested development in the UK.  I thought this about ten years ago when my neighbour at the time, who was a grandparent commented that &#39;the new eminem cd was great&#39; and he sat outside with it blaring away, rapping along to it with his kids and his grand children, three generations of complete fuckwits.  Now we&#39;re all the same, browsing the web for the latest cute animal video, everyone listening to Mumford and Sons thinking that they are somehow not as fake as Lady Gaga.  Nobody wants to be &#39;out of the loop&#39;.  Oh, Brits invariably get down voted because we have been raised on bullshit, so we always spout bullshit thinking we know best, but the truth is we are so corrupted by the BBC and the nanny state that we fail to see the wood for the trees.  I&#39;m always being down voted too, but when I retread my posts I can see why.  Change is a slow and hard process.</p>

But in my case, the people on the shows reactions were totally their own, but in some cases, they said something funny and it was re-recorded with a different camera angle which somewhat robs the original line of it&#39;s original spontaneity. </p>

<p>Other things, like overall ideas are not originally, but because many TV audiences can&#39;t think for themselves, you need to visually present to them a way for the idea to come up in order for them to understand it.  </p>

<p>I do think the more &quot;real&quot; shows reality wise fail to prosper, because they require too much thinking on the audiences part.  One show in particular, &quot;Flea Man&quot;, whose host I have met at my local flea market, was an excellent &quot;real&quot; show that while watching echoed my encounters at flea markets.  But the show bombed because there wasn&#39;t enough fake &quot;drama&quot; for the mainstream to accept it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jersey Shore is not scripted.  I grew up there and have several friends that worked at the boardwalk during summers they filmed there.  The cast is followed by a producer and a camera at all times.  Mostly their actions are enough to make the cut without any directing.  If the camera misses something interesting they have the cast do it again.  It&#39;s those do overs that make the show seem faked.</p>

<p>This was actually the point of the Batman movies too.  The people were shown to be corrupt and deserving of destruction.  The police were shown to be heroic.  Batman (the Hero) represented the Military Industrial Complex that was willing to use ultra-legal methods to fight evil.  Bane (the Villain) actually had the same aims as the Occupy Movement - fights wall street, gives the city back to the people.  Its a very clever ploy getting people to subconsciously agreeing with the aims of the MIC and against Occupy.  Well played CIA psyop, well played.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point is to get people subconsciously against Occupy.  If you support Occupy everything will blow up!  That&#39;s what your subconscious is saying.  In regards to Batman what it has you saying is &quot;Forget the law - just kill the joker!&quot;  Now, I know what you will say - the Batman doesn&#39;t kill the Joker - that&#39;s not the point.  The point is <strong>you</strong> <em>want</em> him to kill him.  </p>

<p>Edit:  And the other thing you are completely missing about Bane destroying the entire city is that is incorrect - he actually put the ability to destroy the entire city in the hands of the people.  See?  He is returning responsibility of the city back to the people, and that is a bad thing because the people cant handle it.  What the people need is a heroic police force to save them.  What the people need is a Haliburton (military contractor which is what Wayne&#39;s company is) to save them.  To save them from themselves and this malevolent force Bane (Occupy) which claims to be helping them.  </p>

<p>Exactly.  You are saying the law is weak and ineffectual.  What we need is a strong executive branch that is hampered by things like the Bill or Rights.  Someone that can order a drone strike without congressional approval and kill American citizens without legal approval.  Normal prisons won&#39;t work.  We need Guantanamo and torture.

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t seriously be trying to compare the real world to the mockery that is the Gotham city &#39;justice&#39; system? The gotham law is weak and ineffectual because the Joker has superhuman powers of houdini-level escapism and can social-engineer his way out of almost any situation that doesn&#39;t involve Batman. It&#39;s also weak and ineffectual because nobody in Gotham seems to question that putting the Joker in <del>his hotel</del> the Asylum doesn&#39;t work. Why doesn&#39;t it work? Well, <strong>it&#39;s a comic</strong> and his fate is to constantly escape and tempt Batman to fall to the level of a murderer.</p>

<p>The thing is with the Joker is that he has already had his day in court, quite a few actually and he keeps repeating his pattern of &#39;break free, murder randomly, get captured by x&#39;. Where do you draw the line on how many chances a repeat offender gets? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Uh no. Everyone deserves their day in court. But I would get pretty cross if a murderer escapes for the 53rd time and goes on a rampage only to be sentenced to yet another session of asylum care.</p>

It is a military contractor - like Lockheed Martin or Halliburton.  He is the Military Industrial Complex.  There is obviously huge overlap between Bane and the Occupy movement - including Bane&#39;s literal attack on Wall Street and how he puts the Establishment on trial.

    <div class="md"><p>When you choose to put aside other elements yes. Two-face, corrupt cops, the fact that Bane let prisoners free, the fact that Batman&#39;s fortune has been part of the character since the comics. Bruce is involved in many things financially, what is the relevance of his owning a hotel or restaurant? The military stuff is just extremely useful in the context. How is Bane&#39;s background relevant to the occupy movement? How about the League of Shadows or Talia? That sounds more like the theories of the masons or the bankers being behind every major event in history, they don&#39;t fit at all with the comparison of regular people rebelling against the powerful.</p>

<p>Also, noticed I didn&#39;t say I wanted an obvious explanation, but detailed.</p>

<p>EDIT Regarding the Joker, if that was the intentions of whoever&#39;s agenda it backfired because his speech about anarchy actually made sense to me. There is one clear example of me wanting the Joker dead, but it&#39;s not in TDK, it&#39;s in one of the comics.</p>

There&#39;s quite a difference in commenting in a forum based medium about real issues full of intelligent people VS living your life watching scripted hogwash television, drinking beer at home on the weekends while cheering on a sports team that in reality means absolutely nothing to you as a person, going to a meaningless soul sucking job in the corporate world that big wigs are just itching to get rid of to increase their bottom lines, and doing it all over again week after week after week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a perfect world, we would be most happy when we can love our fellow man unconditionally.  Sadly, because of the way the world is today, we can not do that and if anything, distrust our fellow man to a never-ending degree.  The emperors of the planet who control everything know what reality shows do, and since the U.S. gives the largest capital to the rest of the world, the U.S. needs to be the first country to fall under a hard dictatorship.  Indeed, these shows demoralize us, but more than anything they&#39;re made to keep a large amount of us occupied and brainwashed, not having the time or desire to actually use our brains and think about the world around us.  With reality shows getting more insane and commercial product placement being shoved down our throats, all it takes now is to show how authority is to be respected and trusted, and through adding that to the equation and throwing some fear campaign and terrorism to the side of your plate, you have a country that&#39;s already doomed, and sadly we can&#39;t do anything about it anymore, it&#39;s too far gone.  I hope I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>I know.  All of these shows are, or at least all of them that I&#39;ve seen.  I can&#39;t even stand to watch most of them because I just get pissed off about how the cops act, how they treat citizens, and how they are glorified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to some extent. &quot;Reality&quot; shows tend to pick the worst elements of society so as to show people that &quot;hey people act like this and they get on ok&quot;, which lowers the bar for the rest of the goggle eyed viewers. It is also a guaranteed way to get viewers. We are voyeuristic by nature but that would not be enough if realtiy TV showed normal people living uneventuful lives. But if you let people believe there are no standards they cease to care. How else would illegal wars be possible if most people werent too busy worrying about their &quot;swag&quot; or having the most up to date tablet/smartphone/car/image? If they distract us with shiny objects then they can do whatever they want. </p>

<p>Police are always going to be protrayed as heroes, because let&#39;s face it, if you trust/respect them, you havent been paying attention. The military are portrayed as heroes because, in some respects they are, they are giving their lives for their country, but it also forces people to get behind them too. If there were story after story of soldiers abusing their power (well, actually there is, they just get brushed under the carpet and whoever exposes them get&#39;s jailed) then people wouldnt be so keen to support them when they go to war. Fire/rescue, they actually are heroes. Unless there is something I`m missing here. But going into burning buildings to save lives, regardless of who started the fire, is pretty damn heroic. </p>

<p>Quite often you will hear people say &quot;yeah all this stuff could be true but I just dont care!&quot; - that is the scariest thing to hear. So you are going to surrender yourself unconditionally? What if they try to take your Iphone and internet access? Then they might care... sad really. </p>

I know that emergency services do good and heroic things most of the time, but the programs are one sided and promote only the positives and that give then the appearance of propaganda.

<p>Sadly I have so many thoughts on this subject - and all the other subjects raised here - that I literally cant put them down into a comment because I`m at work and dont have enough time to proof read the potential thesis I would come out with. </p>

<p>I complete agree with your sentiment that it will affect our ability to band together. Triablism is rife everywhere you look. People talking sh1t about others because of the sports teams they support, the music they listen to, how they dress, how they speak - everything. If it is that easy to turn people against each other, imagine what happens when they actually want us to turn against each other for a bit of &quot;cleansing&quot;. </p>

All one can do is laugh to keep from crying about it all. I got a couple kids and for them to make their way in the world I just want them to be wary so they will make the best decision for them.

Believe me, I am 47 and I have tried many years to save people from themselves. (I&#39;m a paramedic and I happen to be a pretty generous guy, I have let various family members live with me to help them get on their feet). Obviously I have a bit of experience so I tried to get my family and those around me to stop smoking, but the truth is people are gonna do whatever feels good. They won&#39;t choose the hard road. I have, I&#39;m debt free, I have done all the hard stuff like hitting the gym, eating right yada yada , doing well. Point is I have done what you are trying to convey to me. If you have had success with changing people then understand it is because they wantex the change, it was not all you, if you think it is that is your ego talking to you.</p>

<p>Take for example the reality tv show about repo men. In order to be a repo man you have to have a license, the majority or all of the people in that show do not have repo licenses at all. Many actors and actresses in one reality tv show actually show up in another as a completely different person.</p>

I believe it was an editorial, where the writer argued that one of the main reasons we have so many court based shows with black Judges was to give the appearance that american justice is fair to all races. The percentage of Judges that appear on TV who happen to be black is far greater than what exists in our current justice system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you describe the reality shows that give you this notion? I&#39;m not familiar with any reality shows that portray people this way, except for maybe the bachelor/bachelorette shows and the one with the orange Italian Americans.</p>

<p>The majority of reality shows I know of fall into one of these catergories:</p>

<p><strong>People doing what they love:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Top Chef</li>
<li>Project Runway</li>
<li>singing shows</li>
<li>dancing shows</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People doing their jobs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ice Road Truckers</li>
<li>Storage Wars</li>
<li>American Pickers</li>
</ul>

<p>I watch a few of these regularly and have seen a few of the others. It doesn&#39;t seem to me that the people in them are portrayed as you describe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reality TV is in place to allow us to feel passively superior to others without having to actually do anything to better ourselves. We look on the bad behavior of the people on these shows, and regardless how poor our own behavior is, we feel assured and self satisfied that &quot;at least WE could never be that bad&quot;. Thus, all the energy we have which could be put towards fearless introspection is spent feeding ego instead, and we continue to avoid personal growth. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fantastic way to keep parts of the population in a state of perpetual childhood. It&#39;s even gotten to the point where people want to emulate these characters on TV, seeing potential success and status in behaving childishly. Reward a child for his bad behavior, and he will stay ever a child.</p>

I liken the reality TV trend to putting a mirror in front of our collective faces, so that we are stuck watching ourselves for entertainment now while we ignore what goes on behind the mirror.

Reality TV is stupid and I don&#39;t watch it for the most part, beside some cooking shows like Gordon Ramsay and Robert Irvine and also InkMaster. Well written actual TV Shows are rare today. . . I do like The Americans, and Breaking Bad though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My earlier point remarks on the fact that my parents cared about the politics of the nation, they debated privately the current affairs that I didnt understand and they felt passionate about things that were &quot;grown up talk&quot; to me - i leef now that we are told who to support perhaps by our peers, perhaps by our parents and we support them like a sports team - win or lose, not based on who has the better policies. The older I get the fewer people there are concerned with &quot;grown up talk&quot; and more concerned with little distractions such as the examples in my post. </p>

<p>I feel rather than people are getting dumber, that their energies are being focussed elsewhere and this is a problem - there is always going to be a similar range of intelligence levels, that stands to reason, we cant be literally dumbed down, but we can be distracted. I dont care what your IQ is, there are people vastly more intelligent than me and they are distracted by making money, the people who perhaps arent as clever as myself are distracted by reality TV and soap operas and cat videos. I make a decidedly average wage and I am distracted too. I look at <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> and breathe slightly harder out of my nostrils at 1 in 5 of the pictures/gifs, but I still look at all 5. I claim no moral high ground.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but why do you regard procrastination and distraction, focusing on soap operas, sports, making money, reality TV, cat videos as something &quot;bad&quot;. Why &quot;grown up talk&quot; or caring about the politics or the nation is considered &quot;good&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; behavior? If they had it then, they would probably do it the same way we do. Where does this value system come from, is it some western thought about &quot;progress&quot; and purpose of humanity? Wasn&#39;t the procrastination like the ultimate goal of a human being in western society: wait until the retirement and then procrastinate the hell out of yourself. Today procrastination looks like modern day nirvana, so maybe should be considered as &quot;good&quot;.</p>

<p>If its part of some kind of agenda to dumb down the society then why take all the effort and waste the energy to dumb down when you can achieve the final goal by simply going Cambodia style with pepper bombing and genocide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was that saying? They call it &#39;Programming&#39; for a reason.</p>

<p>You are supposed to trust the badge and hate your fellow citizenry. You are supposed to lay down, roll over, hell, fetch for massa officer. You think the big media and government alliances want the little guys to realize that, united, we aren&#39;t so little? You think they want want us to question them, distrust their many agents, or hesitate at the commands?</p>

<p>No, the big media players want you and your &#39;group&#39; of regulars folks to hate some other Joe and his &#39;group&#39; of regular folks. That not only produces ratings and generates revenue for the networks, having the bulk of the masses filled with contempt for and stereotypes of each other divides our similar causes and strengthens big brothers&#39; own vile wants.</p>

<p>The closer we come to economic collapses, the more apparent these practices seem to become. After 9/11, we were told to hate the browns over there and over here, too, and God save you if you dared to call for peace and patience in the US. On 9/10, the day before, we were told that ~$2.5 trillion dollars simply disappeared from the Pentagon. Convenient. Around 2008 with the economic collapses around the world, we were again told to hate and bomb the Muslims across the ocean and to be suspicious of the ones at home who dare question or be suspicious of the almighty US government. Nowadays, as we inch closer to the next collapse, the various jackboot agencies and bureaucracies are telling us to watch and be fearful of anyone who has guns, cash, food-stores, etc.</p>

<h2>Notice a pattern?</h2>

<p>I&#39;d rather warn the world at the top of my lungs and try to save my peer and be deemed crazy than to be deemed sane for keeping my mouth shut and letting others be harmed by impending disaster.</p>

<p>OP says &quot;us&quot; in the title - how does it not include OP?</p>

<p>In other words, it&#39;s a non-post. Turn off your TV - problem solved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see the commercials</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to invite bullshit into my mind, so I haven&#39;t deliberately watched TV for years. If I can, anybody can. Do, don&#39;t talk about doing, and there will be nothing to post about. What forces you to see commercials?</p>

I talk about this shit but I dont do anything about it because I am apathetic. I am lazy and distracted by cute puppy pictures and funny word play. I admit it. I`m not telling anyone not to watch it, I&#39;m just talking about it behind it&#39;s back like a two faced bastard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, those are good points. I know that emergency services do good and heroic things most of the time, but the programs are one sided and promote only the positives and that give then the appearance of propaganda. I guess we as a group want to believe that the people who protect us are invincible and don&#39;t have the human failings that we do.</p>
