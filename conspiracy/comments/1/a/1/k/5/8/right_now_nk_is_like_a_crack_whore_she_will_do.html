<p>This is a time where North Korea can be taken advantaged of, to do almost anything. </p>

<p>Thats one possibility, or the other is much worse. All the media coverage of NK is used to push the rhetoric that NK is going to attack, blame a false flag on it, and things start moving. </p>

<p>Mossad could use NK as a scape goat for something worse, or the US could.</p>

<p>Just be wary if anything happens, and look deeper than just NK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or NK could use a nuke, chemical or biological weapon in or near the US and the media could downplay it as an accident or the work of some domestic group or al-Qaeda.  They would then get &quot;Sorcha Faal&quot; to write a piece saying that it was North Korea and that they used Soviet-developed &quot;scalar&quot; weapons to discredit any notion that it might have been NK.  Not that it&#39;s a bad thing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fun fact 1: NK has nukes, chemical and biological weapons</li>
<li>Fun fact 2: NK has thousands of obedient special ops commandos</li>
<li>Fun fact 3: NK has submarines</li>
<li>Fun fact 4: NK trades drugs</li>
<li>Fun fact 5: South American gangs get shit across the border all the time</li>
<li>Fun fact 6: NK prints US dollars... and maybe other currencies</li>
<li>Fun fact 7: Nuclear weapons don&#39;t need to be on the tip of a rocket to work</li>

    <div class="md"><p>cuz they&#39;re close by, pretty much lol. And also near China. The first invasion, was ordered by toyotomo hideyoshi, I believe. Around that time, Japan was more or less unified, and had a hunch of battle hungry soldiers around. So they sent them all over there to die and whatnot. Until Japan had their industrial era, they were pretty cool with Korea. </p>

<p>Then during the Sino-Japanese war, fighting did take place in Korea, but it was mostly against Chinese. </p>

<p>Japan did way way WAY worse things to China, than they&#39;ve done to Korea.</p>

<p>Mainly Japs are flat out xenophobic, and that&#39;s the only reason they hate Koreans. </p>
