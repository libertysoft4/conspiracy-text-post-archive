        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_arrest#United_States">Laws regarding citizen&#39;s arrest</a> vary from state to state, but the basic idea seems to be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A private person may arrest another:
For a public offense committed or attempted in his/her presence.
When the person arrested has committed a felony, although not in his presence.
When a felony has been in fact committed, and he or she has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Money laundering, accessories to murder, felony fraud, racketeering, innumerable counts of larceny, etc. are the felonies that many of these bankers have already committed and still continue to commit before our very eyes. There are mountains of legal evidence against them for a case, so I would think there&#39;s enough to make a citizen&#39;s arrest too. Additionally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To make an arrest, a private person, if the offense is a felony, and in all cases a peace officer, may break open the door or window of the house in which the person to be arrested is, or in which they have reasonable grounds for believing the person to be, after having demanded admittance and explained the purpose for which admittance is desired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what&#39;s stopping us from singling out those responsible for these illicit operations, breaking down the gates and doors of their mansions to arrest them, and bringing them before courts en masse? I think this is an avenue that hasn&#39;t been explored enough by the American people yet and would love to see some discussion about the potential risks and rewards of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully support the idea of arresting these d-bags, but let me point out something that I immediately considered after reading these posts: these banking executives very likely have armed bodyguards.  In any scenario where you could get close to the banker, you would very likely be facing a hail of gunfire in &quot;self-defense.&quot;  I imagine this has a lot to do with why execs haven&#39;t at the very least been citizen arrested at this point.  You would have to plan very carefully to get close and disarm these individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy way to protect yourself from that would be to have someone video tape the citizen&#39;s arrest, and have everyone shouting the fact that they&#39;re making a citizen&#39;s arrest. That way he can&#39;t justify gunfire in self defense.</p>

<p>To protect from him just destroying the camera, have it live stream to a recording PC (and make sure the banker knows this is happening before he does anything rash). If something bad goes down, your friend safe at home can show the video to authorities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t forget, it&#39;s totally legal to call up any/all of the militia.  Then the government would be in the position of taking up arms in favor of felons (rather than begrudgingly supporting them in the open).  Also, as counterintuitive as I&#39;m sure it may seem to some here, I believe the militia would be in a better position to handle things non-violently.  Far better than a mob.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my hope is that a militia is comprised of more thoughtful people than terrorists.  Plus executions would be waaaaay over the line.  This would be delivering into the hands of the judicial system.</p>

<p>Plus, win or lose, it would force positions to be taken- either for the people or against them.  We can&#39;t keep the national discussion stagnant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well there&#39;s nothing saying that using a militia <em>needs</em> to be violent.  And having some protection there for the arrestor is probably warranted since he&#39;s probably going to get hassled by the cops and arrested himself, or beaten senseless by the guards.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, whomever decides to do it, and his accomplices <em>needs</em> to be well-groomed and take thought to their appearance.  Recording it and getting it out there, the whole stunt could go south quickly if people thought you were just some punk or hobo.  There needs to be statements pre-written and wording figured out beforehand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should be easy to bring 500 or more people with you for what they have done. Body guards are not going to stand by your side against a calm and patient 500 man strong group demanding your arrest. Catch them in a public place, surround the exits to their homes, make it a camp out siege if you have to. Don&#39;t break any laws trying to break in to private property to seize them, just wait them out. The longer it goes on, the bigger the publicity will be.</p>

<p>I think this is the biggest flaw of the argument made by this thread. These people can bend the law and know the loop holes of the law to get away. When they do get away, we would be their next targets too - so we need to keep that in mind. </p>

<p>We are risking a lot and I still think there is not a single evidence that we actually hold against them in court. Besides, we assume the judicial system actually works and will punish them... but we know this is far from reality. Rich and popular people have always got out of jail by doing very little punishment and in most cases, they get away with the crimes completely and write books about it. I think it is great that we are thinking in this manner and maybe we can pull it off if we get the media involved in it but we better have all the right things in the first try. I am saying this because it only takes one failed attempt for everyone to think we are just tin-foil hat wearing weirdos that shouldn&#39;t ever be taken seriously again, and we won&#39;t be able to do this all over again with another banker. </p>

<p>Evidence that can incriminate bankers in a court of law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence exists, it&#39;s not up to the arresting person to have it though:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a felony has been in fact committed, and <strong>he or she has reasonable cause</strong> for believing the person arrested to have committed it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, from a technical standpoint it&#39;s completely doable. Even if it didn&#39;t result in a conviction I think the message of arrests is enough to make a point. </p>

<p>Off the back of it, you&#39;ll have people in the justice system who are willing to go out on a limb and make a name for themselves pursuing it through more conventional means. </p>

<p>Problem is the point the bankers will take from this is that we still have too many rights, and they need to take more from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the blame really all on them anyway? Don&#39;t forget the government our President has committed treason and lied at every chance he has gotten. As a country we torture our enemies and bomb them in their places of worship, while they build death camps to house us and they plan more wars on our behalf. The IRS buys shotguns and homeland security stockpiles enough bullets to kill every man woman and child in america 5 times over and they tell us it is for our protection. Our Congress has totally caved and even when we call in 500 to 1 on bills that no one agrees with they go against the will of the people. There hasn&#39;t been a fair vote in years and with things the way they are one is not likely to come. We train our police to be ruthless highly militarized forces armed with tanks and drones and god knows what else to unleash havoc on the citizens. No longer are they there to serve and protect but to carve out the kings taxes off the backs of the slaves.</p>

<p>Pulling corrupt bankers out of their offices to hand over to corrupt Police, and brought in front of corrupt Judges bought and paid for with bailout money in their pockets though I would love to witness seems like a failing proposition. I agree if we wan&#39;t to fight back then we need to take matters into our own hands as a citizenry and tear down the windmills that stand in our way. But be careful when fighting monsters lest you become one yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure citizen&#39;s arrest is so you can hand the bad guy over to the police who will book and prosecute. The problem with this idea is that the police will not book and the DA will not prosecute. At least, they wouldn&#39;t prosecute the people you brought in. You however, you they will prosecute.</p>

<p>We have to fix the problem at the top of the government. The bankers and other corporate criminals only get away with their crimes because the politicians let them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Money laundering, accessories to murder, felony fraud, racketeering, innumerable counts of larceny, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are some serious allegations. Is there any concrete evidence depicting these felonies? Sure, it <em>seems</em> like these banks have done illegal things, but is there any solid proof <strong>at all</strong> that any of these have happened? If not, you probably shouldn&#39;t jump the next suit you see on Wall Street. You can&#39;t detain someone to bring them in for questioning like the police can (and should, in this case). Citizen&#39;s Arrest laws are not excuses to play vigilante freedom fighter.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> holding on to some pieces of paper that unquestionably incriminates a company or an individual in any of these crimes, then arrest away (well, you should probably lawyer-up and call the FBI first, if you think they&#39;ll do anything about it). But you better believe the banks are going to have a far superior lawyer than you. To say it would be an uphill battle trying to convict these people would be the understatement to end all understatements (one of the many reasons the gov hasn&#39;t gone after them, even if they should). Even if you arrest them, it will be the federal/state governments that will try them in court (their alleged crimes aren&#39;t against you, they&#39;re against &#39;the people&#39;). Then when (not if, but <em>when</em>) the bankers win their case in court, they&#39;ll go after <em>you</em> for unlawful detention/imprisonment, breaking and entering, burglary, trespassing, assault, battery, not to mention every single slander law on the books. And proving those charges would be a cakewalk.</p>

<p><strong>This <em>is</em> an avenue that&#39;s been explored by the people before; it&#39;s just not feasible, practical, or legal.</strong> There may be some rogues who think they&#39;ll stick it to &#39;the man&#39; and show &#39;them&#39; who&#39;s boss, but the law (and often the evidence) is stacked significantly against them.</p>

<p>The law say sure you can arrest someone but you have to hand them over to Law Enforcement as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Once you hand them over, irrespective of the evidence you&#39;ve obtained the DA is going to not press charges. Your banker is released and you&#39;ll be arrested for detaining/kidnapping.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So, what&#39;s stopping us from singling out those responsible for these illicit operations, breaking down the gates and doors of their mansions to arrest them, and bringing them before courts en masse?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The police. In the words of Lenny Bruce:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But ya see, I can&#39;t do it cause I do business with these assholes, and it looks bad for me, you know, ah . . . so I want somebody to do it for me, you know? So I tell you what: Here&#39;s a stick and a gun and you do it -- but wait till I&#39;m out of the room. And, wherever it happens, see, I&#39;ll wait back here and I&#39;ll watch, you know, and you make sure you kick &#39;em in the ass and throw &#39;em in there.</p>

<p>&quot;Now you&#39;ll hear me say alotta times that it takes a certain kind of mentality to do that work, you know, and all that bullshit, you know, but you understand, it&#39;s all horseshit and you just kick em in the ass and make sure it&#39;s done.&quot;</p>

<p>So what happens? Now comes the riot, or the marches -- everybody&#39;s wailing, screaming. And you got a guy there, who&#39;s standing with a short-sleeved shirt on and a stick in his hand, and the people are yelling, &quot;Gestapo! Gestapo!&quot; at him:</p>

<p>&quot;Gestapo? You asshole, I&#39;m the mailman!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s another big problem. People can&#39;t separate the authority and the people who have the authority vested in them. I think you see that a lot in the demonstrations. Cause actually the people are demonstrating not against Vietnam -- they&#39;re demonstrating against the police department. Actually, against policemen. Because they have that concept -- that the law and the law enforcement are one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, let&#39;s presume you do arrest them. You&#39;re presuming a power that you lack -- the power to &quot;bring them before the courts.&quot; A citizen&#39;s arrest is the power to arrest someone <em>and turn them over to the police</em>. The prosecutor having authority over the offense then gets to decide whether or not to bring charges.</p>

<p>So, I mean, even presuming that you could, why would you?</p>
