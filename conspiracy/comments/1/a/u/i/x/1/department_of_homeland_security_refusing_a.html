        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The executive branch is once again flouting the checks and balances system of our government, this time refusing to answer any questions about its recent purchase of 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. The massive purchase by the Department of Homeland Security has left ammo retailers around he country short on supples, which is even affecting police stations. </p>

<p>Some other recent examples of the executive branch refusing to abide the system of checks and balances include their refusal to define the word &quot;belligerent&quot; in the NDAA (a belligerent person can be labeled a terrorist, stripped of citizenship, arrested without probable cause, and detained indefinitely without access to an attorney), and their refusal to abide a Federal Court&#39;s injunction of the NDAAs indefinite detention clause (even refusing to answer whether or not they had already detained anyone under its authority), until the judge dropped the injuction. </p>

<p>How much more evidence do we need before we acknowledge that the executive branch has seceded from the rest of the government, and from the people? They have gone rogue. It&#39;s time to stop arguing about 2nd amendment rights, and USE THEM!</p>

<p>EDIT: meant 1.6 billion rounds, not $. But obviously the point still remains. </p>

<p>EDIT: To you people claiming that the order is only for 240K rounds, you are only looking at one of the orders, and that order is the one which contains 200K hollow point rounds (+40K 9mm rounds). The full order, according to congressional inquiry, is 1.6 billion rounds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are tons of sources mis-reporting this story.  The key question is whether <strong>you</strong> have looked into the original document that supposedly supports this story.  I have.  It totals 240k rounds, not 1.6 billion.</p>

<p>If InfoWars isn&#39;t lying (and thus forbes, etc. picking up on a false story), then surely you can provide a link to the solicitation for 1.6 billion rounds. After all, the entire InfoWars lie is that they have found this solicitation in the public record, and &quot;decoded&quot; it for us.</p>

<p>The truth is, you are being stove-piped. That&#39;s tradecraft. The intention is to render your opinion worthless. It worked on Dan Rather, and it&#39;s working on you.</p>

<p>The question is: why is InfoWars stove-piping you?</p>

<p>Yes, now that they&#39;ve been shown up as fools, they are point to other solicitations.  For example, DHS really has solicited <em>up to</em> 132 Million rounds of .223 rifle ammo -- over the next four years.  </p>

<p>Also that purchase order you showed is one purchase order. If you ran any business you know that purchase orders are accounts with other contracted companies. There is nothing to stop DHS from buying any more than what you listed because it&#39;s supposed to be allocated in the budget not just one PO that you gave below. </p>

<p>All DHS has to do is answer the fucking questions before Congress. Is that too difficult? They are to answer to the taxpayers period. You have seem to forgotten that the taxpayer is the boss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, my points are these:</p>

<ul>
<li>DHS are not ordering 1.6 billion rounds of ammo to begin with (even over 4 to 5 years),</li>
<li>InfoWars began this lie by referencing the solicitation for 240k 
rounds and misinterpreting the abbreviation &quot;MX.&quot;</li>
<li>The original story, and the basis of much hype, was that the order was for some huge number of <em>hollow point</em> rounds for semi-automatic pistols.  That would be an incongruous order, but it never happened.  In particular, using hollow point for training is exceptional and not a sufficient explanation.  Using .223 rifle ammo for training is completely normal.</li>
<li>Soliciting and securing an RFP for, e.g., up to 132M round of .223 rifle ammo over 4 years seems pretty mundane for an agency like DHS. </li>
<li>All of the DHS solicitations for RFPs that I have reviewed and which relate to rifle ammo specify that they are seeking a supplier who can provide <em>up to</em> a certain quantity per year, but DHS is not committing to purchase <em>any</em> rounds.  The solicited RFPs are not even close to purchase orders.  If you think you know so much about business, surely I don&#39;t have to explain that an RFP leads to an agreement, under which there <em>might</em> be purchases, or there might not.  It depends on the RFP and the subsequent circumstances, but many RFPs are essentially part of a contingency plan.  In this case, DHS is making itself <em>prepared</em> to obtain a few hundred million round of rifle ammo over the next 4 years, but not necessarily actually obtaining it at this time.</li>
<li>You and everybody else who is rabidly pursuing this non-story are being stove-piped -- and that is the conspiratorial aspect of this story, not the normal operations of DHS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I wouldn&#39;t answer the counterfactual question from a Tea Bag congresscritter if I were the DHS, either.  It&#39;s not polite to tell Congressional representatives that they are not playing with a full deck, so no response seems appropriate in this matter.</p>

<p>EDIT: I wanted to respond to something specific you wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I stand corrected I did not open the PDF file to see if it was a solicitation order. An order none the less.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should probably read the primary sources before you repeat everything you hear.  I would also think that a person who gets snarky about the definition of &quot;purchase order&quot; would know that a solicitation by the government is not an order.  It&#39;s a solicitation for an RFP.  If you don&#39;t comprehend the difference, please just be quiet and stop wasting everybody&#39;s time who is reading your drivel.</p>
