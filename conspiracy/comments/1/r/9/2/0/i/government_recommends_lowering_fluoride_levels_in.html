<p>A month ago reddit had some post &quot;what can a person say that automaticly makes you assume they&#39;re stupid&quot; (something like that) - one of the highest rated comments was about nay-saying fluoride. It included no fact or rhetoric, just massive upvotes. Maybe an offhanded &quot;its good because the FDA said said so and they love me.&quot; </p>

<p>You can post this shit a million times and people will still think you must be a stuck up rich brat if you don&#39;t drink tap water. </p>

<p>Small groups of people have known the truth for decades. I remember some rasta dreadlocked guy in a black and white flim telling his pupils to not drink much tap water. He didn&#39;t even defend it. It was just a matter of fact reminder to them. </p>

<p>Even if fluoride was good for you, which it isn&#39;t, its totally unacceptable to use a municipal water supply to drug people, rather the drugs are good or bad. If you want fluoride, you have that option available to you in toothpaste and other forms. If I choose to not use fluoride, well, there really is only one water supply in town... Ireland is moving to remove fluoride in their water supply. Now there is only 8 countries left that force feed drugs with the entire public water supply. Out of almost 2oo nations only 8 do this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read the article? It was about areas with naturally occurring fluoride, many many times over what is added to water supplies. You misconstrued the whole article. Also, It&#39;s not a drug, it&#39;s a mineral that can benefit (in measured doses, like added to water) or can harm the population (like a lot of places in China with naturally high levels, hence the research all being chinese) . Is forcing bakeries to use iodised salt drugging the population? Enough with the emotive language, look at the facts. </p>

<p>Why do so few countries fluoridate water: look at the reasons given, don&#39;t infer them. It&#39;s extremely complicated and expensive to fluoridate water, but even more so to repair increased tooth decay. </p>

<p>Fluoridated water is a numbers game, if the population gets enough fluoride from natural water, tooth brushing, or other dental care, then don&#39;t waste money putting it into the water. As the general global standard of dental care increases, the need to fluoridate decreases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certain sub-populations within the US receive doses equivalent to what Harvard considers detrimental to the brain. I probably get less than 1 or 2 milligrams per day, but a tea drinker who uses tap water and eats foods with excessive cryolite and sulfuryl-fluoride residues might receive 10 milligrams or more. So the real argument here is this:</p>

<p>You want to sacrifice the IQ of some people to save the teeth of others because some of the water that people drink happens to brush across their teeth to harden them. If you really cared about people&#39;s teeth, you would advocate something like a high fat/low sugar diet or hand out fliers about brushing your teeth. The pro-fluoride community just want to pretend that the science is on their side. The 1-4 ppm water will push some populations of people over the threshold where the fluoride starts affecting their body in other ways. </p>

<p>It would be like a country with a chapped lip problem adding chap-stick to the water supply because some of the chap-stick ends up on their lips. This is ridiculous. </p>

<p>Alternatives to fluoride are nowhere near as cost effective, and their effectiveness is questionable. I&#39;m not pro fluoride, I&#39;m anti-pseudoscience. Science is on the side of the truth, and the truth is fluoride was very effective at lowering public expenditure on dentistry, and it&#39;s utility is now falling with rising standards of living and dental care. </p>

<p>This research is looking at far higher doses, and has so far only revealed a correlation, not a causative link between fluoride and IQ development. Nor does it thoroughly address the inadequacy of IQ has a brain development metric. I&#39;m not advocating the fluoridation of everybodies water, I&#39;m just trying to say it&#39;s not the apocalyptic conspiracy fluoridation is made out to be 99 percent of the time by people against it. </p>

<p>Here is Israel&#39;s stance on the issue: In 2013 the new Minister of Health Yael German has signed a new regulation setting water quality and not requiring fluoridation, that will take effect in the following year. She has insisted that it was better to provide fluoride in other ways to “target audiences” such as poor children, who were unlikely to brush their teeth regularly with fluoride toothpaste. “It must be known to you that fluoridation can cause harm to the health of the chronically ill and pregnant women,” German wrote in the letter. She argued that only 2% of water is used for drinking by the population, with the rest used for dishwashing, bathing, industry and other uses.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I not provide you with enough material to satisfy this: &quot;Which sub populations?&quot;</p>

<p>Now add all of the links together. A guy who drinks tea made with fluoridated water and eats raisins, dill pickles, a few pills, 8 glasses of 4ppm water, and finishes the day off with two glasses of wine is getting a dose of fluoride much higher than recommended. All of this has been measured. Some people are getting between 5-10 mg per day of fluoride which is a prescription dose. You think some people should be getting a prescription dose for their thyroid so that a few kids can have hard teeth? </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re in denial. Somebody a long time ago said the fluoride people are pseudo-scientific, so you&#39;re just going to stick to that.

    <div class="md"><p>I have never once said it&#39;s for a few kids to have nice teeth. That is a straw man argument.</p>

<p>Sorry, you did give me the sub populations, and it shot your argument: they had nothing to do with water fluoridation.</p>

<p>You argue that a man who does all those things will be receiving a &quot;prescription dose&quot; of fluoride, but what does that mean? Is that the threshold for harm? Because according to all the literature, there is nothing to indicate it will do anything to him at all.</p>

<p>(The following is from wikipedia)
Pseudoscience is a claim, belief, or practice which is presented as scientific, but does not adhere to a valid scientific method, lacks supporting evidence or plausibility, cannot be reliably tested, or otherwise lacks scientific status.</p>

<p>This perfectly matches your condemnation of the fluoridation of water. You have not presented any evidence or facts that demonstrates that the fluoridation of water will cause harm, anything you have presented has either been supportive of fluoridated water not being harmful, inconclusive, or irrelevant. It is therefore unscientific to conclude that it is harmful. That is pseudoscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ABSTRACT: Prolonged administration of a daily dose of 5-10 mg. of fluoride to patients with hyperthyroidism may cause clinical improvement together with a significant fall in the level of plasma protein-bound iodine and a reduction in the basal metabolic rate. Studies with radioactive fluorine failed to demonstrate any important accumulation of fluorine within the thyroid in vivo. Thyroidal, blood and urinary radioiodine studies suggest that fluorine inhibits the thyroid iodide-concentrating mechanism. Fluorine does not impair the capacity of the gland to synthesize thyroid hormone when there is an abundance of iodide in the blood. However, inhibition of the thyroidal concentrating capacity when the total iodide pool is low will impose a critical limitation of hormonal synthesis, and may explain the therapeutic effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you understand what that article is saying?</p>

<p>It&#39;s saying that 5-10mg of fluorine per day over a long period of time has a positive benefit to people with hyperthyroidism. They also said multiple authors investigated the effects of fluorine on the thyroid, and couldn&#39;t find any activity. Hyperactive thyroids are far more sensitive than normally functioning thyroids, and so that is why they tested fluorines impact on hyperactive ones.</p>

<p>No where in the article does it say that 5-10mg of fluorine is harmful to anybody. The article actually states in multiple places that no toxicity was observed at all.</p>

<p>But, even then, the sample size is very small, so it&#39;s not a fantastic bit of research anyway.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article does not say what you think it does, if anything it states that fluoride is of benefit, and even then it was a very short and inconclusive study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m usually called a conspiracy theorist when I claim what you just agreed to. Good job. We are making progress. </p>

<p>Now- should we add this medication to the water, which will push certain populations over the threshold where it acts as a medication on other areas of the body other than the teeth? </p>

<p>Is it ethical to do this? If so, why not add a bunch of other medications to the water?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re called a conspiracy theorist for stating that fluoridated water can help people with hyperthyroidism? That sucks.</p>

<p>I disagree that we are making progress, but that&#39;s beside the point.</p>

<p>What threshold are you talking about? We need to be specific here, so I know what I&#39;m discussing.</p>

<p>My argument was never that we should add fluoride to areas that are already getting enough to prevent cavities, just that fluoride has traditionally been used in a cost effective way to cut down on cavities (which are a public health liability) in populations who were not getting enough.</p>

<p>Fluoride&#39;s use as a medication is irrelevant, it&#39;s an emotive term that adds nothing to your logical arguments.</p>

<p>Is it ethical to do this? My argument is that yes, it is ethical for the majority of it&#39;s implementations, as it has reduced public and private expenditure on a dental problems, and has therefore improved quality of life in the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that&#39;s your whole point? That fluoride has effects beyond that of dental protection? Because I agree, it does, and I told you it does. It helps people with hyperthyroidism. But just because it influences very sensitive thyroids (in a positive way), doesn&#39;t mean it causes harm, and isn&#39;t cause to believe it will.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve refuted nearly every one of your points, and you have not refuted a single one of mine. My points stand: Fluoride at low levels in our drinking water has reduced the cost of dental procedures and improved quality of life around the world. It&#39;s importance and benefit is being diminished by improving dental standards, and so the recommended levels are falling.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no conspiracy or public health concern here.</p>

<p>Do you know how much is in Paroxetine and the antidepressants? I was on that drug for almost a year O_O</p>

<p>EDIT: Anyone know any ways to get <em>rid</em> of flouride from your body? I&#39;ve read a lot about this for lead and mercury, but not sure if it applies to flouride. Stuff like cilantro and spirulina chelates heavy metals, and garlic IIRC. There are others.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Fluoride in paroxetine is not like the fluoride in water. The fluoride in water is a salt, meaning that the fluorine has stolen an electron from a metal nearby, and they form large crystal structures due to charge attraction. The fluorine in paroxetine is bound to a carbon, meaning they are merely sharing an electron, and this sharing of the electron causes the fluorine to stay with the carbon chain, and thus fluoride salts and alkyl fluorides to have completely different properties. I do not believe paroxetine is dangerous because of the fluorine, as it is akin to saying tryptophan is harmful because it contains a benzene ring. That however, is not to say it isn&#39;t dangerous, but frankly, despite the generally negative mood changes, I have never noticed cognitive deficits in its users. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, it&#39;s the nature of poison to break down the system over time. Maybe fluoride by itself is manageable for the body to combat it&#39;s toxic effects. But when you start adding in all of the other toxins we are adding to our food, air and what ever else looks profitable. It starts to take it&#39;s toll on the human body.</p>

<p>This is how you see black widows &quot;crazy women&quot; often kill their victims by slowly poisoning them. I&#39;m not saying they intentionally trying to kill us, I just don&#39;t think some people care that much if they can make a profit from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, filters and chlorine are what is preliminary used to purify water prior to introduction into the public supply.  You thought that fluoride was used for purification?  I am honestly shocked that this belief is out there.  Fluoride is highly dangerous.  Drugs should <strong>NEVER</strong> be forced upon everyone without their consent.  If fluoride is so important, provide individual prescriptions for topical (clearly note that this is the <strong>ONLY</strong> beneficial method of treatment to tooth health, not by drinking it).  It is <strong>not</strong> right that a person that drinks more water eàch day, or someone who weights less (skinny, children, babies) should not dicate the relative dose of fluoride poison.  </p>

<p>Also do not let this slip through your mimd - the fluoride used primarily in the US is not medical issue fluoride.  It is a crude industrial waste product.  I&#39;ve removed it from my diet, as much as humanly possible, and much difference has been noticed.  No third party drinks, fruit safety, short showers, and exclusive distilled water consumption.  The price is not much.  $20/month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, okay. I knew it was dangerous I just always thought it was an outdated necessity, a bit akin to asbestos. As far as the false belief, we may be a bit out of the loop in Louisiana; I think we fall in the bottom 10 states for fluoride levels so the water isn&#39;t everybody&#39;s prime concern. That&#39;s not to say nobody here has a correct understanding, but it may have something to do with this particular fluoride justification.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me know, though.</p>

All in the name of oral health, although the risk hardly justify the minimal benefits.  I&#39;ve re!moved it altogether in my diet and positive changes were noticed after the third month.  Even if its not in your water supply, many other drinks and foods have it present.  Good luck in your quest for truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been attempting to locate a specific chart that shows all major bottled water with fluoride content, but it&#39;s proving very difficult. Anyway, there are other charts online. It varries. Some waters labeled &quot;purified&quot; are simply bottled municipal water. Some are &quot;spring water&quot; that come from areas with a high background sodium fluoride problem. Etc. </p>

<p>Your tap water, if in the US, is probably fluoridated. It&#39;s quite easy to look up the data (I&#39;ll help if needed, but I don&#39;t recommend telling me your specific city). I think around 97 percent of Europe <em>doesn&#39;t</em> fluoridate, and something like 70 percent of the US does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the bottled water.  Many bottle water manufacturers simply use municipal tap water &amp; then bottle it &amp; charge 10X as much.  Some bottle water advertise having Fluoride removed, which might be good except then you also have to be concerned about the plastic the water is sitting inside.  </p>

<p>This is why, for example, the Nestle CEO has said water is not a fundamental human right &amp; needs a price tag.  The corporations have taken over our public water supply &amp; just do what they want to it &amp; make us pay for it.</p>

<p>At any rate, i do not personally trust any of it &amp; prefer to mechanically separate my water from anything that might be in it.  That is why I bought a distiller, which is the only way to truly ensure the majority of the bad stuff is taken out.  After water is distilled, it should not conduct electricity &amp; be a reactive molecule - Pure H20.  </p>

<p>I admit though that the body needs minerals and things to survive, so I will sometimes supplement my water with things like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vibrant-Health-Green-Vibrance-Family/dp/B000NDME6C/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1385211005&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=green+vibrance">Green Vibrance</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vibrant-Health-Rainbow-Vibrance-powder/dp/B005XLR9CS/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1385211041&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=Rainbow+vibrance">Rainbow Vibrance</a>, <a href="http://www.infowarsshop.com/Survival-Shield--Nascent-Iodine_p_1104.html">nascent Iodine</a>, &amp; <a href="http://bodyelectrician.com/archives/56">BodyElectrician&#39;s 70+ colloidal plant minerals</a>.</p>

<p>I distill my water with the MegaHome 1 Gal Water Distiller.  <a href="http://durhamagainstfluoride.com/filter-your-water/">You can buy one off my Anti-Fluoride site &amp; support my effort to remove fluoride, or you can get one 50 dollars cheaper on Amazon yourself.</a></p>

<p>Alternatives to fluoride are nowhere near as cost effective, and their effectiveness is questionable. I&#39;m not pro fluoride, I&#39;m anti-pseudoscience.

<p>This research is looking at far higher doses, and has so far only revealed a correlation, not a causative link between fluoride and IQ development. Nor does it thoroughly address the inadequacy of IQ has a brain development metric.
