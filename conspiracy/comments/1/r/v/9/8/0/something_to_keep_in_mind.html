        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sometimes I waste a bunch of time replying to a random message... so figured I&#39;d copy it here to a post, so it can see some light.</p>

<p>The modern world of so-called Western Civilization began at the end of the 17th century with the blossoming of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_empire">British Empire</a>. That empire actually began several hundred years earlier with the establishment of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_london">City of London</a>, which is now an 800-year corporation that controls finance from an entity called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown">‘The Crown’.</a> This entity is the creator and controller of the Bank of England, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Federal_Reserve">US Federal Reserve</a>, the World Bank (IMF – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imf">International Monetary Fund</a>), The European Union, and various cartels and corporations across the earth.</p>

<p>The Crown Identity is kept most secret, and The Crown Bank of England took and assumed control of the United States during the Roosevelt Administration (1901-1909) when its agents, who were really Crown agents (J. P. Morgan), took over 25% of American business.</p>

<p>The Crown has never been the King or Queen of England since the establishment of the corporate body, but the British Monarchy is a figurehead for The Crown, rules parliament in Great Britain and has authority over the Prime Ministers through a Vatican knighthood called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_garter">Order of the Garter</a>. The Crown, however, is not the King or Queen of England – they are an established monarchy of the corporate body.</p>

<p>The Crown is the directorate of the corporation, and Great Britain is ruled by The Crown, the City of London which controls the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_england">Bank of England </a>– a private corporation. There is a private state existing in Britain within the centre of London. This City, located in the heart of Greater London, became a sovereign-state in 1694 when King William III of Orange privatised the Bank of England, and turned it over to the Vatican banksters who today rule the financial world.</p>

<p>The City/The Crown Corporation is not subject to British Law; it has its own courts, its own laws, its own flag, its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_london_police">own police force</a> – exactly like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_Vatican_City">Vatican city state</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia">Washington DC</a> Columbia. The Crown Corporation is also separate from the Metropolitan city; its police drive red police cars and their uniforms are different from the Metropolitan Police.</p>

<p>Also, The Crown in London houses the privatized Bank of England and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London">Lloyd’s of London</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_stock_exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>, and all British Banks. It also houses the branch offices of 385 foreign banks, 70 US banks, as well as Fleet Street newspapers and publishing monopolies. It controls the world media and world intelligence. It is out of The Crown City of London, the headquarters of British Freemasonry overseen by the British Monarchy and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Kent">Duke of Kent</a>, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Grand_Lodge_of_England">World Freemasonry</a> is governed. This includes the Grand Orient Masonic Order and the Washington DC <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Rite">Scottish Rite.</a></p>

<p>In 1945 the Bank of England was nationalised by the Labour Government, and is allegedly no longer a private bank, although it governs the US Federal Reserve. It is ruled over by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family">Rothschilds</a>, who are bankers for the Pope – guardians of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Works_of_Religion">Vatican Treasury</a>.</p>

<p>The City of London also has its own Lord Mayor, different from the current Mayor, who has the power in The Crown Corporation. When the Queen wishes to conduct business in the City, she is met by the Lord Mayor at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Bar,_London">Temple Bar</a>. Temple Bar and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Association">associate franchises</a> come from what is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inns_of_Court">Four Inns of the Temples of Court</a> – the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Temple">Inner Temple</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Temple">Middle Temple</a>. The <a href="http://cdn.londonist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/pegasusInTheInnerTemple.jpg">logo of the Inner Temple is a white horse</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ihs-logo.svg">sunburst seal</a> of the Jesuit Order. The white horse is a symbol of the British Empire / Order of the Garter / Crown Corporation, and is the <a href="http://rdgable.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cfr.png">same white horse</a> which is the symbol of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations">CFR</a> (Council on Foreign Relations). The white horse is a Jesuit symbol – Pegasus. <strong>It is the Jesuit Order that governs the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. The Inner Temple is the core group that governs the City of London Corporation.</strong></p>

<p>Also you should go and research <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_Company">Livery Companies</a> as they are the nuts and bolts of controlling the various economical systems in the world today. And apparently are worthy of your <em>actual worship</em>.</p>

<p>Id have to give original credit on these topics to Jordan Maxwell and his efforts at awakening people, thats what piqued my interest years ago... but the more you learn about power structures the more obvious it control system becomes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Charitable&#39; is a word we should be very wary of.</p>

<p>It is through this &#39;charity&#39; that real influence <em>IS</em> exerted... regardless of their &#39;trade secrets&#39; and the like.</p>

<p>Im sure that the real, fundamental <em>push</em> that is leading us down the road of a corpratocracy is made by &#39;non-profit&#39; and &#39;charitable&#39; organizations.</p>

<p>In terms of practical evidence, all these livery companies have websites which contain advertisements of their projects and successes, and an objective review of these projects as a whole would no doubt show a strong trend towards internationalism, which is the keystone of the powers desire to bring everything under their own control.</p>

<p>As a final note - <a href="http://internationalbankers.org.uk/">these guys</a> I am sure, do more than drink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it&#39;s definitely masonic.  I know many people who are members of livery companies.  I even have direct relatives who were in charge of them.</p>

<p>The US also has several livery companies which are still tied in to those in London.  The first continental congress was held in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenters&#x27;_Hall">Carpenter&#39;s Hall</a> in Philadelphia.  It&#39;s right around the corner from independance hall and across the street from the First Bank of the United States, which also met there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not include this in my original reply... but a post specifically defending livery companies - I was pretty sure - would have been made by someone connected to them. As you say, you have direct relatives who were in charge of one.</p>

<p>This is nothing derogatory, just logic tells me the bias shown by your relatives in favour of concluding a lack of influence of these corporations is to be expected, no?</p>

<p>Talk to a Rothschild and they would, I am sure, have an verbal essay of justifications and misdirects at the ready, designed in major part to make the other party feel uneducated.</p>

<p>The old &#39;Masons are just good men who like to spend time with other good men&#39; misdirect that - while technically truth - omit context and therefor omit understanding.</p>

<p>If, like you say, they are &#39;an exclusive group where craftsmen have the opportunity to rub shoulders with peers&#39; - then that says all that needs to be said. What these people are <em>discussing</em> while <em>rubbing shoulders</em> is the inception of ideas... Ideas that are in the favour of them, and their companies, increasing profit. That profit can only come at the expense of the people, who you and me happen to be part of. And that is the &#39;nuts and bolts&#39; of the movement we all see constricting the freedom of the planet. Vis-à-vis - They are a major part of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>historically you are correct and the masters are typically peers.  It was a way to control knowledge and contracts.  They still operate as any secret society or exclusive club, which gives them access to to others in the top strata of their business.</p>

<p>So yes, in a way I agree.  The top contractors who recieve the largest contracts are most usually going to be led by members of the livery companies.  But that&#39;s not what their &quot;livery business&quot; entails.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a union for the top tradesmen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very impressed with your knowledge of inner circle banking cabals. Question, I am sure you know all of this is Luciferian and the players at the top worship the angel of light. How does this impact you spiritually? Once my eyes were open to this I saw the only refuge really was Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see Christ as simply a representation of the solar diety. The &#39;sun&#39; dies for 3 days in the depths of winter and is &#39;reborn&#39; 3 days later, representing the return to summer. The biblical stories of Jesus were incorpoarated over 300 years after his &#39;life&#39; by people seeking to control the population. His &#39;fishes&#39; motif is a representation of Pieces, as Moses and his rams horn was a representation of Aries.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with learning the lessons &#39;Jesus&#39; taught, but they all should be available to you without the need for the story. Do unto others... its pretty simple really.</p>

<p>But any &#39;God&#39; who not pure love - one that demands worship or threatens &#39;Hell&#39; or damnation for sins - is nothing but a tool of control. If the God of the Bible were real, he should have revealed himself by now.  He did a lot of &#39;talking&#39; to people and took part in the forming of society, <em>back then</em> why should he not be so active now? </p>

<p>All that said, I believe you do curse yourself to &#39;Hell&#39; by committing evil deeds. This Hell is self-imposed though, and is created through guilt and regret. You stain your soul, which is what I believe the elite are doing to themselves in the name of &#39;Lucifer&#39;, &#39;Venus&#39;, &#39;Saturn&#39;, &#39;Satan&#39; - whatever name you wish to give him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First: have my up vote and gratitude for this post, despite disagreeing it is refreshing to once again have these posts here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Now The City basically works (politically) like most &quot;free trade&quot; zones, which can be found based on (Vienna 600 years ago).</p>

<p>Unfortunately despite the validity of most of your claims, you are ignoring a major asset that defined (for better or worse) 19th cent. political ideology and that is the rise of the international Jewry. </p>

<p>The relevancy of rising liberal, anti aristocratic Jewry ideology (mainly fomented by their 1800&#39;s century Reformation), aligned with their financial assets (Rothschild being the sole British financer during the Napoleanic wars) concluded with their rise and ultimate stronghold of global politics and economy post-WWII.</p>

<p>Not that their rise went uncontested, during William Orange usury was held illegal and most Jews were executed or expelled from Britain, anti-Semitic climate among (usually Christian) industrialists of early 1900&#39;s was notable in their alliance to Nazism.</p>

<p>The Vatican itself tried to circumvent their rise, mainly through their Hitler Mussolini support </p>

<p>PS: I&#39;m writing this off the bat and on my phone and cant fact check what I&#39;m claiming,  just wanted to get this off my head !!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main reason for my post is not to conclude anything (except the original intent to show the link between the Inner Temple and the Jesuits - shown in the stained-glass window showing a clear connection between the White Horse of the Inner Temple and the <em>very</em> clear Jesuit sunburst, alternating straight and wiggling sunbeams) but simply to raise awareness of real stone-and-mortar institutions (corporations) that exist today that most people raised on non-alternative media have no concept of.</p>

<p>Im not trying to start an awakening, that has obviously begun in earnest. I am trying to focus attention on the real problems, to stop people constantly naming &#39;unnamed bogey-men&#39; as the whole story.</p>

<p>Crown Corporation, however, is a real elephant-in-the-room that is so poorly understood in the world today that any light we can shine on it, the better for the people of the world.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also, for my own part, I have judged the word(s) &#39;anti-semetic&#39; to be, in essence, evil. I believe it, as a word, is nothing more than a tool of propaganda, and <em>anyone</em> mentioning it immediately raises red-flags, for me. I am not saying you are out to discredit this information, only that its use must always be scrutinized. I thank you for your reply, but urge you to find another expression to classify the issues you refer. With it included, your words are forever marred by a hypothetical question mark I am sure you would rather not garner.</p>

<p>Take world issue, add word &#39;anti-semitism&#39;, discredit world issue. Its too dangerous an equation, in my opinion.</p>
