If they can&#39;t come up with Germany&#39;s gold in a timely fashion, then they don&#39;t have anybodies gold.  in other words,if the fed spent German gold without any qualms, it shouldn&#39;t have a problem with using another countries gold to replace Germany&#39;s...  Shouldn&#39;t they be able to go to Fort Knox and borrow 500 tons?  No..  The Fort is empty as well.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Bundesbank will repatriate 674 metric tons of gold from vaults in Paris and New York by 2020 to restore public confidence in the safety of Germany’s reserves.</p>

<p>The phased relocation of the gold, currently worth about 27 billion euros ($36 billion), will begin this year and result in half of Germany’s reserves being stored in Frankfurt by the end of the decade, the Bundesbank said in a statement today. It will bring home all 374 tons of its gold held at the Banque de France and a further 300 tons from the New York Federal Reserve, it said. Holdings at the Bank of England will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>“With this new storage plan, the Bundesbank is focusing on the two primary functions of the gold reserves: to build trust and confidence domestically, and the ability to exchange gold for foreign currencies at gold trading centers abroad within a short space of time,” the Bundesbank said. It said the complete withdrawal of reserves from Paris reflects the fact that Germany no longer depends on France as a financial center to exchange gold because both nations use the euro.
Germany’s Audit Court sparked a debate about the country’s gold reserves last year when it called on the Bundesbank to take stock of its holdings abroad, saying their existence had never been verified. German gold reserves, the second-largest in the world after the U.S., amounted to 3,391 tons as of Dec. 31 and were valued at 137.5 billion euros.</p>

<p>Yes this was reported on Zero Hedge, and yes I have never since seen any kind of follow up. Including on this thread.</p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting for someone to weigh in with an answer or some kind of subsequent news report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Federal Reserve a consortium of mostly foreign banks feels that this gold is theirs now and are not going to give it back.  Their point is if you want what you think is your gold then take it.  If  you can&#39;t then shut up or say what you want but the answer is no.  There is a scramble to acquire all the gold and silver by several very large entities.  At the same time us ants are being told that precious metals are passe and not worthwhile.  So, grab your used gold and sell it for low prices as soon as you can.  Don&#39;t walk run to the guy with the sign in front of the sleazy gold store and give him your gold in exchange for paper.  Then march to the big box store and buys some shoddy slave goods.  Imagine, the admiring glances you will receive from your peers.  So good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is truly bizarre because the Fed just makes money out of thin air, regardless of any value behind it.</p>

<p>What is the point of using gold anyway? What transactions would the Fed need gold for? </p>

<p>They MAKE money out of thin air and can CHARGE people for it, so what other entity would they be dealing with, that doesn&#39;t accept the US dollar as payment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany wants to inspect its Gold Reserves and its requested to have 150 tons of it shipped back to Germany. Not a big deal. Read the attached article that explains how the Gold Reserve System works. But the article does raise an important point. Is the Gold being held by the Fed really there? I don&#39;t think it is. I&#39;ve read and seen various stories that say the Gold was sold off in the 80s during Reagan&#39;s term. There was an inspection by reporters in the 70s that ended up raising more questions than it answered. Just like in this article, the reporters were shown one vault filled with gold but some people did the math and based on the Gold in that vault and what the Fed said they had, wouldn&#39;t fit in Ft. Knox. They also weighed the Gold bars and they weighed a few pounds less than they were supposed to.</p>

<p>Finally, Germany recently got some of its Gold back and found out some of it was gold plated tungsten.</p>
