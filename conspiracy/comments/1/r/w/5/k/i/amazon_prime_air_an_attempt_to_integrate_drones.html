Really wish a certain someone had quelled opposition to drones by promising not to kill U.S. citizens. </p>

<p>This is also happening in a time when conspiracy theorists are slowly being drawn to be candidates for ameri-terrorists by pop media. And preventing terrorism is their most publicized military application. Aaaand we have no promise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This drone stuff is ridiculous....</p>

<p>1) The shipping cost would be insane. Because it&#39;s shipping a single parcel you&#39;re going to pay the full cost associated with that shipment. </p>

<p>2) Thieves will have a field day with this, shooting down drones with sling shots or something and stealing the packages.</p>

<p>3) The application is so limited... unlikely they&#39;ll be shipping large items (and if they do, the shipping cost will be HUGE).</p>

<p>Carrying parcels in the air is ridiculous because the energy required to keep something in the air is far more than to roll it along the ground. Hence, cost is far higher. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason trucks, trains and ships are used to transport 99% of the worlds goods and not planes. </p>

Think about it for 1 second, they being the powers that be can execute anyone at will. So since we know that this is doing something good with said tech.</p>

<p>Now I know that most people in here will claim I am gunna shot it out of the sky it flys over muh house. Pfffff you try that and see how that goes for ya. If someone or some cooperation wants you me or anyone else dead it is gonna happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think of me when you&#39;re staring at a few drones in the sky trying to reassure yourself that they&#39;re only amazon drones and that you have nothin to worry bout.<br/>
Honestly, even with the perception of history that&#39;s been built by the winners, I think it&#39;s naive to watch the world develop and not be worried about certain things. No one has the courage to consider that most of what we know is wrong. </p>

<p>And &quot;some cooperation&quot; doesnt want its &quot;everything-is-alright-you-guys-are-paranoid-lol&quot;-ers dead. So you&#39;re right. Just keep buying stupid shit all the time  even though you and the mass majority of folks are scrapping the bottom of the barrel for a source of income. Just keep doin what you&#39;re doin, and if anything else spooky happens, you can always bury your head in the sand again. Of course naysayers want to see FULL DEVASTATION TIER results to come to fuitition as proof of what us paranoid critics are bitching about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off I am hardly scraping the bottom of the barrel. I make around 1000 to 1500 k a week after taxes. And my bills hardly total 1000 a month. I busted my ass to get where I am so I don&#39;t have to decide what gets paid and what don&#39;t. So I can go drop over 1000 on black friday and not care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I can find meaning in philanthropy but that doesnt mean buying iwhatevers for financially stable relatives or kids you added to the world. If busting your ass your entire life to make 50-70k a year-so you can buy extra plastic shit on black friday without caring- is meaning, go bonkers. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t explain Meaning in few enough words to imply I know the meaning of meaning, but thinking critically about the world we live in and looking out for those who dont... seems a lot closer to it than 50k </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t about legos lol you and others take it as that is all I post cause I found a sub that I relate too so that is all you know about me. I enjoy a great many things in this world.</p>

<p>And I have busted my ass to get where I am. Now I don&#39;t have to I found a job I am good at without having to work as hard as I did before. Now I get a decent wage and heaps of overtime. I found the balance. </p>

<p>There is to many people out there that can do it for themself I was one of them that always felt I was being looked over like I was the victim. I wasn&#39;t I just thought I was then I said hmmmm these other people eat, breath, and shit the same way as I do what is the differance. So I figured it was attitude I changed mine and made it. Am I saying I am well off. Hell no I am just comfortable. I refuse to help anyone that don&#39;t show me they want help. </p>

<p>For instance there is a girl that works at a gas station near my house great person.  Always happy nice to me and the wife and kid and is never in a bad mood. Least she don&#39;t show it well I know she needs help here and there. She told me her little boy likes legos we went and got some wrapped them up and said here ya go. Merry xmas for you and yours also gave her some other sht too. </p>

<p>Point being if someone needs help and I feel they are trying the then and only then will I do something. Till then I don&#39;t care. Plus those legos are going to help underprivileged kids at a library close to us. Every thru of the month they do a lego building thing for kids and parents we donate our sets for the day so they can build them. Yeah it isn&#39;t giving them away but it is what I do.</p>

<p>I share my hobby with others offer input and feedback for others in that sub not selfish by any means.</p>
