There is a difference between pointing out the flaws in israel and a statement like &quot;The jews are using their unearned wealth to take over media.&quot; One is racist, the other is a criticism of the government of Israel, which I am all for, because I hate their policies and what they pass off as International Policy.</p>

<p>If Mormons had an outsized role in U.S. foreign policy would it be racist to note this?  To complain about it?</p>

<p>You are falling victim to false claims of &quot;racism&quot; (and it&#39;s a bit of a red flag you equate anti Jewish bigotry with &quot;racism&quot;).  If anything, this privileged status that makes any criticism of Israeli or Jewish influence is bigoted behavior in and of itself.</p>

<p>This reception in the general public is a result of massive propaganda blowhards and fascists like you have created.</p>

<p>Your fascist friends literally put people in jail for not agreeing with the official story.  The German people were literally &quot;re-educated&quot; and forced to accept the official story on pain of imprisonment and loss of livelihood.  Your nutter friends issue death threats to the prominent revisionists like Jewish revisionist David Cole and David Irving.  </p>

<p>You and your nutter trolls mod and brigade most of the other subs on this site to make sure your propaganda is enforced.  There is probably no other issue where you and dozens of your friends (with multipiple accounts) will appear out of the woodwork to attack.</p>

<p>For instance, your nutter friends got a reasonable comment critical of Israel censored from bestof and got all of conspiracy banned because this was &quot;racist.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a false reality you are imposing.  I&#39;m glad we have at least one place where honest inquiry can (sort of) go on.  Yet you trolls are doing your best to disrupt this place.</p>

<p>Hell, you successfully ran off Amos_Quitos and MaxActivist making the same allegations and now you trolls are stalking me.</p>

<p>Typical Holocaust denier BS.  Thousands of surviving witnesses were wrong.  Every Nazi that admitted to participating in the Holocaust was intimidated or threatened.  Every one of the thousands of documents related to the Holocaust was forged.  Every one of the hundreds of historians who meticulously studied the historical records was a co-conspirator.</p>

<p>I used &quot;holohoax&quot; tongue in cheek in one of my many comments on the subject (which you have obviously combed through) because I was getting hounded by a conspiratard like you and who refused to hear that I <strong>rejected the term Holocaust denier.</strong>  I can&#39;t even remember the exact context but I did not intend that all of the &quot;Holocaust&quot; was a hoax.  I only stated the case for homicidal gas chambers has not been proved--I accept other instances of murder took place.  So yes, some people did perpetrate a hoax in this limited respect.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the term &quot;Holocaust&quot; should have ever been adopted to describe Jewish suffering during WWII and it was adopted well after WWII so that people like you could use it as a weapon and support what Norman Finkelstein has described as the Holocaust Industry.</p>

<p><strong>I specifically admit that Jews were murdered and abused</strong> during WWII.  They suffered simply because of their religion and ethnic background.  Just as Japanese Americans suffered.  </p>

<p>Zionist is an acceptable term that I will gladly use in polite company.  I have both Arab friends and Israeli and Jewish friends.  Hell, I know an Arab who is married to a Jew.  I treat all people with respect.</p>

<p>Yes, I am more free to discuss issues on this sub and other alternative sites than I am IRL.  But this is a good thing.  Israel and Zionism is a taboo subject because propagandists like you have successfully made it a taboo subject and have created a privileged status for Jews when discussing these matters.  This standard in America is actually a racist standard as people like Atlas Shrugged and Neocons get away with all sorts of racism directed at Arabs yet any criticism of Zionism is falsely conflated with &quot;racism&quot; by propagandists and liars like you.</p>

<p>Most Holocaust deniers do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Key elements of Holocaust denial:
&quot;Before discussing how Holocaust denial constitutes a conspiracy theory, and how the theory is distinctly American, it is important to understand what is meant by the term &quot;Holocaust denial.&quot; Holocaust deniers, or &quot;revisionists,&quot; as they call themselves, question all three major points of definition of the Nazi Holocaust. First, they contend that, while mass murders of Jews did occur (although they dispute both the intentionality of such murders as well as the supposed deservedness of these killings), there was no official Nazi policy to murder Jews. Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1 million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers. And third, Holocaust deniers contend that the death toll of European Jews during World War II was well below 6 million. Deniers float numbers anywhere between 300,000 and 1.5 million, as a general rule.&quot; Mathis, Andrew E. Holocaust Denial, a Definition, The Holocaust History Project, July 2, 2004. Retrieved December 18, 2006.</p>

<p>Holocaust deniers generally do not accept the term denial as an appropriate description of their activities, and use the term revisionism instead.[6] Scholars use the term &quot;denial&quot; to differentiate Holocaust deniers from historical revisionists, who use established historical methodologies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And hey, you&#39;re the second Conspiratad troll to post the same bullshit.</p>

<p>I am not interested in &quot;denying&quot; facts . . . I am interested in historical fact and use established historical methodologies to form my opinion.  And I do not claim to have absolute certainty . . . under the circumstances there was a lot of false propaganda and the victors imposed their version of history via force and there is a lot we will never know.  </p>

<p>You propagandists throw around the term &quot;Holocaust Denier&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; to shut down inquiry and debate.  If anyone is engaging in denial behavior it is someone who uses these tactics rather than accepted methods of debate--you know, counter an argument with a fact or argument rather than an ad hominem attack.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the argument that homicidal gas chambers were used but the evidence does not support this claim and your side has not met the burden of proof.  The Soviets made a mock chamber to &quot;prove&quot; one existed and used confessions gained from torture. The primary documents don&#39;t prove homicidal gassings occurred and the forensic evidence likewise doesn&#39;t support homicidal gas chambers.</p>

<p>This is reasonable interpretation of the most important facts.  I&#39;m willing to change my mind if you present better evidence.  </p>

<p>In response to these argument you sling ad hominems and make appeals to authority (most historians are not going to risk jail or career suicide by entertaining revisionist arguments).  The mere fact your side has to literally jail historians who don&#39;t support your side is a strong indication the truth is not on your side.</p>

<p>Not at all.  But conspiratard trolls that pounce on my comments minutes after I posted, like you did (you weren&#39;t even on this days old thread before I commented) and who have painstakingly gone through my comment history on the Holocaust, and who are joining a whole brigade of other like minded trolls from conspiratard, are most likely propagandists.  Running interference on this and similar issues is a priority for you conspiratard propaganda trolls.  You guys even make light of it how you&#39;re Zionist warriors or JIDF warriors, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There aren&#39;t hundreds of accounts from &quot;murderers&quot; supporting the homicidal gas chamber claim.  A few people like Hoss were tortured into giving contradictory and unlikely testimony that is obviously fabricated. Other German defendants at the show trials didn&#39;t bother defending the German state from these claims because they were concerned with defending themselves; they would say they weren&#39;t involved with or didn&#39;t see any gas chambers while there may have been gas chambers elsewhere. </p>

<p>And actually there were few Jewish prisoners who actually saw gas chambers.  The best witnesses are the Jewish prisoners who allegedly collaborated with the Germans by running the gas chambers but their stories are not believable.   </p>

<p>Also, there have been ground radar and there is no physical evidence of mas body burnings at Auschwitz.  There were crematoria there as there was a Typhus outbreak and many people did die . . . around 150,000 according to German and Red Cross records.  So the Germans disposed of these bodies by burning.  But there have never been evidence found of large scale body burning in open pits even though forensic tests have been done.  </p>

<p>And there is no thousands and thousands of documents in the official record supporting homicidal gas chambers.  Quite the opposite.  To get around this uncomfortable fact (because the Germans kept great records for everything else and they didn&#39;t appear to hide other facts of their treatment toward Jews) the official story is there was a secret oral order and nothing was put in documents.</p>

He was being totally reasonable and describing his experience visiting Israel.  His post was promoted by all of bestof.

<p>I, like others on this sub, was mostly drawn to the fact that you conspiratard trolls falsely claimed the post was racist and that the mods of bestof not only censored the post but collectively punished all of conspiracy for the post by banning us from appearing on bestof*.  And you conspiratard trolls are jumping for glee and now coming here and attacking users here for being racist.</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy sub and we should be able to discuss Zionism and even question the Holocaust, just like we do 9/11 or the JFK assassination.  This is not racism, it is skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I&#39;ve actually reviewed the testimony.  Most prisoners didn&#39;t have direct evidence of the gas chambers . . . because according to the official story those that would have been such witnesses were killed.  </p>

<p>The Sonderkammandos would be the best (most important) witnesses to support the gassing story as they obviously had a reason to view the operations and live (they allegedly collaborated with the Germans by helping with the gassing and cremation operations).

<p>I prepared a lengthier response to your conspiratard troll buddy but erased it because it&#39;s pointless arguing with trolls and I would rather save this for a legitimate debate partner, but here are 3 videos that show some interviews with these witnesses and show the unreliability of both the German and Jewish witnesses:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boy, you sure are gullible.</p>

<p>A couple thousand people packed like sardines are going to stay locked inside a room when <em>poison gas</em> is thrown in because a couple guards are outside.  Sure buddy.  That makes sense.  No way these people instinctively panic and push against the doors and windows.</p>

<p>And fuck you with your demand for proof and then refusal to look at said proof.  According to your definition any attempt to prove the official Holocaust story wrong in any way is anti semitism so you&#39;ve set up a nice little Catch 22.  You must think you&#39;re really clever.  You just adopted this trick from places like the ADL.</p>

<p>You refuse to consider revisionists history then say it hasn&#39;t been proved.  So you are obviously a bad faith troll.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t even watch an interview with one of the leading Holocaust historians on your side where he discusses issues like the doors on the alleged gas chambers.  Unfortunately, only &quot;anti semites&quot; (according to your sick mind) like Jew David Cole are asking these questions and he was able to ask Dr. Piper these questions only because he is a Jew and was insistent on getting answers and ignored propaganda trolls like you.  It eventually became too much for him (just like with other revisionist historians like David Irving) who had their lives threatened and their liberty taken away so they finally stopped asking questions.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would imagine they started the gas after they left the room, not while they were bringing the Jews in. Do you have a source that the rooms were not adequately ventilated that is not from an organisation that has links to neo-nazis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Leuchter Report goes into detail about this, but once again it&#39;s going to fall victim to your catch 22; you won&#39;t consider revisionist evidence because by your definition revisionism is anti semitism and therefore the revisionist case wasn&#39;t proved.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s the gas that would still linger after the gassing and when they were handling the bodies that would poison the sonderkommandos.</p>

<p>Anyway, the burden of proof is on your side.  Do you have any evidence the mock up the Soviets built is accurate?  You prove the ventilation they allege is feasible.  You do know they built a chimney that isn&#39;t even connected to the gas chamber?  As in totally fake?  I don&#39;t need a degree in physics to know this is no proof of a homicidal gas chamber.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proof? Have you not seen the pictures? This seems like a very easy thing to say ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course I&#39;ve seen the pictures of the crematorium.  The few that exist.  And do you see how improbable it is that the Sonderkommandos claim to have stacked 3 or 4 bodies at a time in there?  Have you even looked at the evidence that shows the impossibility of burning a million people at Auschwitz?  Oh yeah, you have a catch 22 that you won&#39;t look at the evidence and therefore in your great logical mind it&#39;s never been proved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know Hitler made several quotes about his determination to eliminate the jews right? Why do you think he was lying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where&#39;s the documentation of Hitler&#39;s plan?  Hitler definitely was anti Jewish and he wanted to expel the Jews from Germany.  This is why he partnered with the Zionists to force Jews to emigrate to Palestine until Hitler stopped cooperating with the Zionists in the early 1940s.  </p>

<p>And they clearly brigade and stalk users here.</p>

<p>Nice.  Another name calling rant that is a lie.  </p>

<p>Go stalk someone else.</p>

<p>I am not afraid to post my questions about the Holocaust and WWII in other subs even though you propagandists will pounce.  I&#39;ve done it before.  I don&#39;t care about my internet points.  I care about the truth.  It&#39;s you trolls that spend all your time propagandizing and trying to influence opinion by gaming this site that are focused on voting.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I have you trolls following me around hounding me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know that 99.9% of people on the planet would find your views repellent, don&#39;t you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all.  Again, a false version of history was imposed on most of the Western world.  This is true of almost all history.  I am skeptical of all history written by victors.  I&#39;m skeptical of much of U.S. history.  </p>

<p>I find that people find me very reasonable when I meet them in person or have the chance to discuss issues with them.  It&#39;s you that is trying to make me a pariah just for asking questions.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re proving OP&#39;s point that instead of sticking to the facts and debating a particular theory or historical event you&#39;re shouting someone down and making false allegations of racism.</p>

<p>Edit: spelling</p>

<p>Not at all.  But conspiratard trolls that pounce on my comments minutes after I posted, like you did (you weren&#39;t even on this days old thread before I commented) and who have painstakingly gone through my comment history on the Holocaust, and who are joining a whole brigade of other like minded trolls from conspiratard, are most likely propagandists.  Running interference on this and similar issues is a priority for you conspiratard propaganda trolls.  You guys even make light of it how you&#39;re Zionist warriors or JIDF warriors, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s you answer for the hundreds of witness accounts from both victims AND murderers supporting the existence of gas chambers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There aren&#39;t hundreds of accounts from &quot;murderers&quot; supporting the homicidal gas chamber claim.  A few people like Hoss were tortured into giving contradictory and unlikely testimony that is obviously fabricated. Other German defendants at the show trials didn&#39;t bother defending the German state from these claims because they were concerned with defending themselves; they would say they weren&#39;t involved with or didn&#39;t see any gas chambers while there may have been gas chambers elsewhere. </p>

<p>And actually there were few Jewish prisoners who actually saw gas chambers.  The best witnesses are the Jewish prisoners who allegedly collaborated with the Germans by running the gas chambers but their stories are not believable.   </p>

<p>Also, there have been ground radar and there is no physical evidence of mas body burnings at Auschwitz.  There were crematoria there as there was a Typhus outbreak and many people did die . . . around 150,000 according to German and Red Cross records.  So the Germans disposed of these bodies by burning.  But there have never been evidence found of large scale body burning in open pits even though forensic tests have been done.  </p>

<p>And there is no thousands and thousands of documents in the official record supporting homicidal gas chambers.  Quite the opposite.  To get around this uncomfortable fact (because the Germans kept great records for everything else and they didn&#39;t appear to hide other facts of their treatment toward Jews) the official story is there was a secret oral order and nothing was put in documents.</p>

<p>Ahhh you admitted it. You&#39;re really bad at hiding your holocaust denial, you should ask that amos_quito guy for tips.</p>

<p>and hey you didn&#39;t respond to our other argument where you were blatantly saying that gas chambers didn&#39;t exist in the holocaust and then linked to anti-semitic websites with links to holocaust denial and neo nazi organisations.</p>

<p>Can you please use this phrase more? I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve thrown it about quite enough. If ever a sign of desperation reared its head, this is it.</p>

<p>Again, bestof came to its senses and was done with you because of your broken-record rhetoric, and I can&#39;t say as I blame them for it. </p>

<p>Based on your petty attempts to defend yourself against the truth (not your version, the <em>actual</em> truth), you are also probably a Holocaust denier as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not my assertion.  It&#39;s what they said they did!  They evidently told thousands of innocent people to march into a room for their &quot;showers&quot; and didn&#39;t warn them they were about to be murdered.  They collaborated in murder.  If you can believe them.</p>

<p>Actually, they are most likely lying about their activities because it&#39;s not believable that the Germans would trust a few Jewish prisoners to do this and only have a couple German guards.  And their description of the logistics is just not believable.  </p>

<p>They packed people like sardines into a room, that was literally so crowded they couldn&#39;t fall down when dead, but these people thought they were really going to get showers?  They didn&#39;t revolt?  And the doors used to secure the rooms were super flimsy?  And these thousands of people filed through single doors and the few Sonderkommandos used &quot;hooks&quot; to pick up the bodies and put them on flimsy carts and were able to move thousands of people a day (can you imagine how difficult this task was?).  And they went in after the gassings and didn&#39;t use protection even though they likely would have been poisoned themselves if they really did it that way (not to mention the rooms were not adequately ventilated so they and the Germans living nearby would have been poisoned as well).  </p>

<p>And their description of the crematorium process is totally not believable.  There is no way that many bodies could have been processed in the way they describe.  They give ridiculous times for how long it took to incinerate a body and even then it doesn&#39;t add up.  </p>
