    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I would assume it&#39;s in the interest of USPS to do these deals even if the margin is really low.</p>

<p>Unless there is evidence the Postal Service is being cannibalized to enrich private parties (like Fed Ex, UPS, DHL, Amazon, etc.).</p>

<p>I do think there is evidence USPS is being sabotaged and its historical function in this country is being privatized to enrich private parties (for instance the &quot;reforms&quot; of USPS and saddling it with the pension obligations).  I don&#39;t know if there is evidence of collusion to enrich parties like Amazon though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that works both ways.  Traveling to every address 6 days a week (for now) is a requirement imposed on the USPS and it makes them less profitable (which is why they want to cut delivery days down).  So this requirement actually enables them to cut a deal with Amazon for a very low price that they couldn&#39;t get from private outfits (assuming Amazon gets a bulk deal with the USPS which I don&#39;t know is a valid assumption or not).</p>

<p>I actually agree that the Postal Service should be required to deliver to every address every day (or at least 6 days a week) as I think our mail should be a subsidized government function as our founders believed.</p>

<p>Actually, if anything Congress taking money away from the USPS (from Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The USPS has not directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters.[6] Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume,[7] after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act,[8] (which mandated $5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to pre-fund retiree health-care, 75 years into the future, a requirement unique among organizations and businesses in the U.S.[9]), revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced[10] declining mail volume,[11] prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit.[12] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I would like to see evidence that this was really a significant operation and not just a gimmick to prove a point and create a legal case.</p>

<p>It&#39;s foolish the think private enterprise would be able to deliver mail more democratically and cheaper than the a government monopoly.  If we let private enterprise deliver our mail to any address in the country and made them deliver 6 days a week and provide the other services that USPS did it would definitely cost more after the profits and subsidies were taken out.  We in fact ended/minimized subsidies to the USPS so the days of a democratic and cheap postal service are probably coming to an end.</p>

<p>The ability to mail letters cheap all over the country were a huge benefit for the majority of people.  There are some areas government can provide services more democratically and cheaply and postal service and health care are two examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it would cost more for people who lived in remote locations to get their mail. Those in cities, where population density is high and addresses are close together, would get their mail more cheaply because they wouldn&#39;t be subsidizing the rural addresses. Why should we &quot;make them&quot; deliver 6 days a week? I have no need for mail that often, and I would gladly pay less if I could for less frequent deliveries. Rural people would probably just pick their mail up from a central location on their way to/from town when they went shopping. There&#39;s no real need to have mail trucks deliver to every address all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you make a good point that there is less of a need than there historically has been.  But I still think there is a benefit to treating all citizens, rural and urban, equally when it comes to mail delivery.  </p>

<p>There are still some people that rely on mail delivery (people receiving drugs, for e.g.) and it does promote a higher quality of life for all citizens.  Plus, I don&#39;t see how it hurts.  In an era where drones are taking over our jobs I don&#39;t mind subsidizing good jobs and subsidizing cheap and efficient mail delivery for all people. </p>

<p>Privatizing it just means higher expenses for most, or less convenience, and worse jobs for the workers.  The USPS is a model that has worked for generations and its a shame to see the propaganda chip away at this venerable U.S. tradition.</p>

<p>There are some areas where Socialism works well and mail delivery is one of them.  </p>

<p>I actually would like to see the USPS re-institute its role in banking and to see a nationalization of internet services.  Access to the internet and e-mail services is very similar to mail services and we pay way too much for crappy private service when we could have a government utility provide a much more democratic service.</p>

<p>Why? Subsidizing rural life just makes more people live there, which means that the subsidies must continue forever. It leads to permanent inefficiencies. If people want the rural life, fine, but they shouldn&#39;t expect others to pay for it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It hurts because wealth is redistributed inefficiently, which is a drain on economic growth.</p>

<p>Privatizing means lower expenses, because there are incentives to lower expenses. Public sector corporations with monopoly privilege (USPS) have little incentive to do better with the money they have because they can&#39;t go out of business and they have no real competition.</p>

<p>Why? Subsidizing rural life just makes more people live there, which means that the subsidies must continue forever. It leads to permanent inefficiencies. If people want the rural life, fine, but they shouldn&#39;t expect others to pay for it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not subsidizing all rural life . . . just a certain aspect of it.  Mail delivery, cable, phone, internet and health care should be delivered to all citizens equally imo.  This is based on fairness.  Same with school buses.  Rural kids should have the same access to schools even though it costs more to bus them there.</p>

<p>It hurts because wealth is redistributed inefficiently, which is a drain on economic growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, &quot;redistribution&quot; of wealth is a buzzword that drives me up the wall.  All economic systems redistribute wealth.  Laissez faire capitalism does this as well . . . the power of capital allows the wealth of the lower classes to be hoovered upwards.</p>

<p>Organizing an economy so that there are lots of middle class workers, be it postal workers or clerks in ma and pa stores, is much better for the vast majority of people.  We are all a lot better off paying slightly more for U.S. goods and services in ma and pa stores than we are paying less for crap made in China.  Efficiency is not always the best goal.  We can have children slave laborers and drones make cheap goods for the 10% of Americans that still have any purchasing power in a neo feudal capitalist society and this may be &quot;efficient&quot; but it&#39;s not a just or good situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fine, you do it then. I do mind, and I&#39;d rather opt out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Providing jobs in certain sectors does not preclude others from holding private jobs.  While I would like to see the number of jobs provided by the government expand (mostly in health care, but also things like national parks, postal workers, and newly nationalized industries like internet and some banking services) I would like to see a stronger privatized sector in other areas (like the ma and pa stores we&#39;re talking about here trying to compete with Amazon and Walmart or in farming).  I would love to truly see small business supported more.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, they have lower expenses because they do not have the same mission to treat customers and employees with the same level of respect.  Efficiency not only ignores the quality that customers get and the deal employees get, but it ignores the profit wrung out of the system.  Walmart is hella profitable but instead of this profit being shared amongst a whole middle class of shopkeepers it is in the hands of very few people.  This is not good &quot;efficiency.&quot;  Efficiency is not always good.</p>

<p>The illustrated story looks well done.  I&#39;ll try to look it over if I have more time but I can already tell I disagree with some of the assumptions . . . like capitalist investment is necessary to grow an economy . . . or the idea that greed is good.  This is capitalist propaganda imho.  Don&#39;t have time to rebut it but I think there are certain sectors where other forms of organization other than laissez faire capitalism are superior.  </p>

<p>How is it fair that some people pay for what other people receive?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the power of capital allows the wealth of the lower classes to be hoovered upwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because in a free market system, the only way to get wealth is to have other people give it to you. And the only way they&#39;ll do that is if they are also benefiting from the transaction. In a free exchange, <em>both</em> parties get wealthier, or the exchange wouldn&#39;t happen. What we have right now is a system where people use the government to get wealthier than they otherwise could, by, for example, controlling regulatory agencies to harm the competition. When government is involved in a transaction, one party usually loses, because otherwise the transaction would have happened without the government involvement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, &quot;redistribution&quot; of wealth is a buzzword that drives me up the wall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are all a lot better off paying slightly more for U.S. goods and services in ma and pa stores than we are paying less for crap made in China.</p>

<p>No, we are better off getting the most value for your money. If you value something more that&#39;s made locally, then get it. <a href="https://mises.org/rothbard/protectionism.asp">Here&#39;s a classic essay</a> on why protectionism and &quot;buy local&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense economically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would love to truly see small business supported more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then buy from them. The problem is that small businesses really do suffer from a lot of inefficiencies due to their small scale. However, they are also more flexible than big businesses, so they can often out-compete the big guys by being more responsive to consumer demands.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to see so many huge businesses, you should also work to keep the government&#39;s hands out of the economy. Big businesses get bigger once they have enough political clout to start bending the laws and regulations in their favor. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">regulatory capture</a>. Ending corporate personhood would also help, since corporations&#39; owners can hide behind their businesses and reduce their own liability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Walmart is hella profitable but instead of this profit being shared amongst a whole middle class of shopkeepers it is in the hands of very few people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You forget that the &quot;profits&quot; are shared with the people who shop there, in the form of lower prices. Walmart has made significant improvements in production and supply chain efficiency. No, I do not idolize Walmart; they use the government to get lots of special treatment and subsidies. But they have been very good for us in terms of doing more with less. They create a lot of wealth for themselves, yes, but the amount of wealth they create for their customers is significant. A penny saved is a penny earned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>like capitalist investment is necessary to grow an economy</p>

<p>Capital goods are just things that make other things. We don&#39;t build a factory just to have a factory; we build it because it can make other things that we do use.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Greed is the incentive that drives many people to produce things for others. I take it you don&#39;t go to work every day out of an altruistic desire to make the world a better place. You do it so you can get paid.</p>

<p>Because we live an a society of people.  It&#39;s often better to pool our resources together.  For instance, we decide to provide for national defense for all even if some don&#39;t want to.

<blockquote>

<p>Hey, I agree with you.  My preference would be to nationalize major important sectors, banking, health care, etc., and then heavily regulate any corporation over 50 people or so and get rid of the corporate veil.  Let&#39;s go back to partnerships and sole proprietorships.  Sure, maybe some companies can be over 50 people but they should heavily regulated and taxed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then buy from them. The problem is that small businesses really do suffer from a lot of inefficiencies due to their small scale. </p>

<p>Well, there is an efficiency to large scale business but this is often a net negative.  There is no way to prevent this other than government intrusion.  For instance, we use to have more protection for American business but &quot;free trade&quot; policies with places like China helped these big corps get bigger.  Government capture is a problem inherent in capitalism and why we need to artificially limit corporations.  If I were king I would break up most big companies just because of the inherent power.  There might be a few areas where non government large private companies are needed (where the efficiency of scale outweighs the societal costs), like in some manufacturing concerns, but these should be the exception.  </p>

<p>Just because we do doesn&#39;t mean that we should, and it doesn&#39;t justify the inherent unfairness of taking money from some people and giving it to others. Why do those who have no children, or those who choose private schooling or homeschooling, have to pay tuition for other people? Public schooling is also extremely inefficient, with more and more money thrown at them with little to no improvement. Economics aside, it also introduces some rather scary systemic biases to have your government in charge of education. It becomes politicized and subject to corruption.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Good. Then give to charity. Or start your own charity. Or start a company and start employing people to help them out. Forcing other people to give to the causes you support is not charity, but theft. Even if the cause is noble, the means by which you fund them is not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are some really good examples of Keynsenian economics being used to get the slack out of an economy (see e.g. 1930s Germany and Japan </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with &quot;stimulus&quot; attempts is that they just kick the can down the road. The money has to come from somewhere, and when the government is in charge of moving it around it typically gets dumped into wasteful projects that squander resources. It&#39;s easy to see the good that comes from a new public works program or whatever, because the money is concentrated in one place and you can see the results of its efforts. What&#39;s much more difficult to see is where that money was taken from -- private citizens who would have used it in trades that enriched both parties. Public money is always allocated inefficiently because the politicians are spending other people&#39;s money on things for other people. Private money is allocated much more efficiently because people are spending for their own benefit, so they take time to ensure they are getting the best value for their money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then heavily regulate any corporation over 50 people or so and get rid of the corporate veil.</p>

<p>Then you just have silliness like France&#39;s multitude of <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-03/why-france-has-so-many-49-employee-companies">49-employee companies</a>. Large companies aren&#39;t the problem; large companies who use the government to their benefit (and their competitors&#39; detriment) are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, we use to have more protection for American business but &quot;free trade&quot; policies with places like China helped these big corps get bigger.</p>

<p>Real free trade doesn&#39;t require a policy. It requires that the government stops interfering with the trade that happens naturally. Protectionism is stupid, and Free Trade Agreements just pick winners and losers. If you want actual free trade, open the borders and stop telling people what they may or may not do with their money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government capture is a problem inherent in capitalism and why we need to artificially limit corporations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Government capture is a problem inherent in <strong><em>crony</em></strong> capitalism. If the government has no say in what companies do with their money, then companies have no use for controlling the government. When buying and selling are legislated, the first things bought and sold are legislators.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I were king I would break up most big companies just because of the inherent power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absent the government, the only power that a company has is the power to please consumers. If Mega Company A is doing such a fantastic job of pleasing consumers that Little Companies B, C, D, E, and F can&#39;t capture any market share, then breaking up A is just hurting consumers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have let the super rich run amok. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can only run amok because they can control the government. Otherwise, everything they do to enrich themselves would also enrich others, which I see no problem with rewarding. Global wealth is not a fixed pie. If someone solves a problem for consumers and gets fantastically wealthy because of it, they&#39;ve also benefited all their customers too.</p>

<p>public schools.  I think this has been a great success.  Privatizing schools would be a net negative for everyone. </p>

Our public schooling is not the reason kids aren&#39;t getting jobs or are going to jail, etc.  These are wider scale decisions on how to run our economy and propagandists use free market excuses to try to justify it (it&#39;s really a top down policy to offshore jobs and create a police state to enrich a few people but they hide behind &quot;free market&quot; propaganda).</p>

<p>This right here is my main problem with laissez faire, libertarian, Austrian (and even Anarchistic) viewpoints.  It discounts the idea that private companies can yield undue power and influence.  Look at the trusts that developed over 100 years ago.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s really easy for a few individuals to control everything so there really is no freedom of choice and freedom of contract.  The natural state of affairs is to collude and to unfairly wield market power to crush competition.  This is not &quot;solving a problem&quot; for consumers.  This is trapping consumers.  Just because someone got wealthy doesn&#39;t mean they benefited consumers.  Private health insurance companies serve no real purpose and they got insanely rich.  But are their consumers any better off than countries that have socialized medicine or single payer health care?  No.  This is a profit that capitalists invented and provides no added value and it simply exists by making sure the better alternative is not pursued.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Since public schools forcibly take money from people, the burden should be on them to prove that public schooling is <em>significantly</em> better for everyone than private schools, where people voluntarily spend their money. There are lots of private schools right now, and their students usually perform at levels equal or better to nearby public schools, but for a lot less money. Private schools have incentives to reduce costs on administration, etc., but a counter-incentive to produce a valuable education for students since parents have to pay a lot out of pocket for them. Public schools have no such incentive -- they just have to squeak in under last year&#39;s budget and do what they can to get a bigger budget next year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private health insurance companies serve no real purpose and they got insanely rich.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The insurance industry in the U.S. is anything but private. And it&#39;s not even insurance any more. Real insurance spreads unknown risk around. What we have now is a byzantine third-party payment system designed to confuse consumers and make pricing decisions extremely difficult for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a profit that capitalists invented and provides no added value and it simply exists by making sure the better alternative is not pursued.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real insurance provides an immense benefit. It pools risk. You pay a fee (the premium) to protect you against a catastrophic loss. The &quot;insurance&quot; we have in the health care industry has been distorted to pool payments for known and expected costs, not just unknown risks. This changes consumer behavior considerably. If your auto insurance covered oil changes and gas, do you think you might have less concern for the price of gas? Maybe drive a little farther just for the fun of it, or get an oil change every 1,000 miles just because you could? Now imagine that someone else was paying your premium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s a double edged sword.  They can get rid of more inventory and reach more customers this way but have to cut prices.</p>

<p>Amazon is not the sole reason ma and pa stores are failing.  It&#39;s macro U.S. economic policy over the last 40 years or so.  It&#39;s the &quot;free trade&quot; deals with places like China.  It&#39;s the rise of places like Walmart.  And the competitive advantage of internet stores like Amazon that don&#39;t have to pay sales tax is a huge advantage to mostly larger companies.  </p>

<p>This increased competition generally lowers prices for consumers but at the expense of the millions of people that use to own and earn a living by working in this sector.  It&#39;s now been replaced by a few billionaires at the top (Bozo and the Waltons) while the middle class owners/workers have been replaced by low wage drones.</p>

<p>I would rather a country where we pay more to local merchants for mostly locally produced products in stores owned and run by locals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a recent change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazon.com supports online sales tax these days. How’s that for an about-face? For years, <strong>Amazon avoiding sales tax was a prime—perhaps the prime—company strategy.</strong> Price was even more important than convenience, and the sales tax swing was plenty big enough to make all the difference.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re wrong about distribution centers (from the same article as above):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(5). Warehouses Aren’t Presence. By 2008, Amazon had distribution centers or other facilities in 17 sales tax states. Amazon was collecting tax in only four of them: Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota and Washington. Yet it kept warehouses in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas. See 2008 Amazon Annual Report. </p>

<p><strong>Amazon claims warehouses or fulfillment centers are not a legal presence sufficient to create nexus for tax purposes.</strong> See Sorry, Shoppers, but Why Can’t Amazon Collect More Tax? That argument has appeal to purists but seems a stretch. Isn’t a 500,000 or 600,000 square foot warehouse with a hundred employees a presence in the state? See Amazon’s (not so secret) war on taxes.</p>

<p>Amazon definitely makes a profit on its sales business (one of the reasons its stock does well) but it reinvests in things like this drone venture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the system is manipulated; there is no doubt of that. But without the quasi-legitimization of the initiation of force this situation simply could not happen. Where there is government power to force people to do x or y, there are corporate entities that wish to corral that force to do their own bidding. Without the government force to start with, corporations have to compete like everyone else.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because the vast majority of people who use this talking point advocate government of some sort . . . especially to enforce the contracts or property rights they they hold so dear.</p>

<p>Anarchists are at least being intellectually consistent when they argue against all government.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>just like when a cop murders someone, it&#39;s not murder, because it&#39;s Legal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the better analogy would be the state going to war.  It sanctions killing therefore it&#39;s not &quot;murder&quot; but justified homicide.  Execution is another analogy that works.</p>

<p>When cops kill someone they usually justify it under self defense and even citizens have this right and many Anarchists or libertarians would claim this is a natural right.</p>

<p>And yes, describing taxes as &quot;mugging&quot; is a bit histrionic.  The same could be said for when the government uses its power to enforce your property rights.  Say I see an apple tree in your back yard and I decide to chop it down and take it.  The government would come and mug me of my apples to enforce your &quot;right&quot; to these apples.  All government enforcement of contract and property laws can be described as a &quot;mugging.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s a bit histrionic because the government is providing you with the very currency you claim is being stolen from you.  </p>

<p>Look, I think taxes are a harsh way of funding the government.  I think government should mostly be funded by fiat money.  Income taxes should be abolished except on the top 1% to 10%.  Employment taxes should be abolished.  Most sales taxes should be abolished.</p>

<p>I think there should be tariffs to protect American products and taxes on sinful items we want to regulate . . . like alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, gambling, and stock trading.  As mentioned there should hardly be an income tax.  And local governments should raise money with a wealth tax (also preferably on the top 1% to 10%) and a small real estate tax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are using the word &#39;histrionic&#39; improperly</p>

<p>your arguments are bizarrely inconsistent, which is doubly silly because you are accusing people of being &quot;inconsistent&quot; when they (correctly) instinctively sense government taxation as theft, or &quot;mugging&quot;. </p>

<p>the veracity of something does not depend on the person(s) who are delivering the message, or their other beliefs that they happen to have. taxation is theft, whether or not people are down with government, or support government but don&#39;t like taxes, or support taxes but don&#39;t like government, or whatever scenario you want to come up with. </p>

<p>as an anarchist, i may not be the biggest fan of statists who are anti-taxation but still support the state, but at least they can recognize taxation for the mugging that it is. unlike yourself, who recognizes taxation as theft, but at the same time do not, because you apparently just do not have the balls to force yourself to admit the truth</p>

<p>edit: didn&#39;t even see you say &quot;it&#39;s a big histrionic because the government is providing you with the very currency you claim is being stolen from you&quot;. oh my goodness.....i am sorry i bothered you. apologies</p>

<p>More like their actions are consistent with a company whose agenda is more about sacrificing some money now for a larger payoff down the road. More companies used to be this way.

I know that there is the general feeling that great measures are taken to ensure precision and avoid civilian casualties. But I also know that compartmentalization is very effective, and it is in the interest of the higher-ups to project the feeling of these measures, whether they are true or not.</p>

<p>The existence of the double-tap standard clearly points to a reckless attitude on the part of those giving the commands. The CIA commanding a majority of the drone strikes is also very reckless. The projected image just doesn&#39;t add up. Talk is cheap, and actions speak louder than words. Especially when those words are coming from politicians and bureaucrats.</p>

<p>Edwin Black has also written a cautionary tale about the automobile industry in his book <a href="http://www.nazinexus.com/">nazi nexus</a>, which includes a discussion of Ford Motors relationship with the Third Reich. Today, cars are responsible for <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/why-clean-cars/global-warming/">about 20%</a> of the U.S.&#39;s carbon emissions, which is a pretty big chunk of global carbon emissions and may have genocidal consequences.</p>

<p>Google is investing heavily in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_cars">autonomous cars</a>.  At the same time, scientists, policymakers, and engineers are working on developing AI for drones to make <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/national-security/soon-drones-may-be-able-to-make-lethal-decisions-on-their-own-20131008">lethal decisions on their own</a>. Amazon says their drones are going to be autonomous, too. </p>

<p>How much of the AI research which contributes to amazon&#39;s autonomous drones and google&#39;s autonomous cars do you think will also contribute to the U.S. military&#39;s autonomous killer drone program?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that progress is dangerous. Not all advances in science are good. Nuclear weapons? Nuclear power? Carbon-polluting technologies?</p>

<p>I bring up manifest destiny to point out that what is progress for some (settlers expanding westward) can be catastrophic for others (the tribes who already lived on the land). What is an advancement for some (digging into the land for gold and uranium and coal and oil) is violent for others. </p>

<p>Who benefits from autonomous drones? And the increasingly advanced killing machines which have been developed in the last 100 years?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing &quot;stop making scientific/artistic advancements.&quot; I have a problem with the way these are being made now, led by corporations, military r&amp;d, elites, and capital with minimal or self-serving concern for the well-being of the earth and the life it supports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh thank goodness. Thats a very rational argument. Yes, progress for some can be a detriment to others, but I am a bit confused by your nuclear argument with regards to ecological protection. Nuclear power is arguably the best way to produce power with a low carbon footprint. Coal burning and natural gas power plants have hurt the world far more with their carbon output than nuclear ever has with radiation leaks, yet you don&#39;t see any press flaming about it like they do with Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.</p>

<p>Lets ignore the fact that modern designs of nuclear reactors are fantastically built to withstand virtually any type of trauma short of a meteor. There are not a whole lot of these new ones being built other than China.</p>

<p>Lets ignore the fact that the reactors cannot be built near fault lines.</p>

<p>Lets ignore the hyperbolic statements of radiation from Fukushima reaching dangerous levels on the west coast of the United States (the baltic sea has more radiation than the Pacific).</p>

<p>Lets ignore the fact that over 20% of the power in the US is from nuclear energy.</p>

<p>Storage of the spent fuel rods is an issue, yes. But it is a far more elegant solution than having to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>So why do you think that Nuclear Energy would not help our ecological problems? Its one of the only options to go for, and Thorium reactors are extremely promising as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you think so. One concern I have with nuclear power is that it  carries the baggage of nuclear security and the entrenched military-industrial complex. </p>

<p>Another is that progress for some/detriment for others debacle. I don&#39;t remember who the tribe was, but there was a conflict recently because the u.s. wanted to create a new burial site for nuclear waste on tribal land. The waste needs to be stored for 10,000 years, and the tribe is upset because they consider the land sacred and are not the beneficiaries of the energy and never needed nuclear power to sustain their way of life anyway. </p>

<p>On top of that, nuclear energy is dangerous and risky. Perhaps concerns about Fukushima and other reactors are overblown, but fukushima was pretty bad and next time could be even worse.</p>

<p>Above all, though, nuclear energy just isn&#39;t enough. Ted Trainer has <a href="http://www.greens.org/s-r/48/48-11.html">argued</a> very persuasively that renewable energy cannot sustain a consumer society, even if we were to harvest as much as possible. The same is true of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510002004">nuclear energy</a>. The rich countries&#39; energy consumption is simply too great, and the rest of the world cannot &#39;catch up&#39; unless there are massive cutbacks.</p>

<p>Basically, I think that devoting time, energy, and talent to things like developing drones is really misguided. Even if there is nothing nefarious about using them to deliver books, it benefits the billionaires. Global wealth &amp; energy inequality is staggering and these kinds of developments prolong and deepen a problem we desperately need to address.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? neither are scientists/engineers. But you are expecting the scientific and R&amp;D communities to focus on solving global wealth and energy equality. If &quot;they&quot; are responsible for making sacrifices because &quot;they&quot; have too much money, why aren&#39;t you? You don&#39;t need your cell phone or computer, or 50% of the food you eat. You can live on less and donate that money to the people who need it. So why don&#39;t you? You are only making the problem worse by being a consumer and funneling more money to the billionaires that own these corporations. But you have the balls to say its their fault and not yours, your fucken paying them. You are probably better off than more than 50% of the world when it comes to wealth. You are part of the problem, not a victim of it. </p>

<p>Do you honestly think the money that went into developing the latest version of the OS on your computer was better spent than the money that is being spent on R&amp;D for drones? But you are not complaining about that, because its practical to you. You bought your computer thinking that its value was worth the price; it would return to you in entertainment and usefulness what it initially cost. but when a company invests in R&amp;D, thinking that the investment will return itself in future profit, they should be shamed! How dare a company spend money for personal gains and not on solving &quot;global wealth &amp; energy inequality&quot;. You are a selfish hypocrite. Complaining about others not doing their part when you have done nothing yourself.  </p>

Such a small number of people control such a vast amount of wealth that while we can be a part of the problem, we can also be a part of the solution.

Globally that puts you in what would likely be the top 5%, probably even higher.

<p>You are against R&amp;D into something not because its nefarious, but because the money could be spent on something that fixes the wealth disparity.

<p>What difference is that to the man who is starving to death right now because he can&#39;t find food?

Both are luxuries, unnecessary, completely &quot;wants&quot; rather than a &quot;needs&quot;, but apparently one is worse because they have acquired more wealth than you.

<p>You say they have far more ability to make sacrifices but what does that even mean? is it not relative? Would a ex-homeless man being evicted from the house he just lived in for 2 months take living on the streets as hard as you would? Who do you think would be making more of a sacrifice? If you scale that up to the wealthy, why are they expected to sacrifice their wealth when you are not? why should you be entitled to a new phone/computer/TV/console when they must sacrifice a new house/boat/car? Its relative. You have yet to address this question. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to play the &quot;i&#39;m talking about billionaires&quot; game. They are much less responsible for wealth inequality than everyone else. Yes I said that. why? because there are only about 1500 billionaires having a net worth of 5.4 trillion. If you were to redistribute all of that money try and figure out how much it would put in everyone&#39;s hands (hint: its less than $1000). Compare that to the ~230 Trillion dollars in wealth that exists and you&#39;ll find that anyone with a net wealth of over 37k is on the hook. aka, nearly everyone in western society. But fuck that right? its not your responsibility, push the blame to someone else. </p>

<p>It matters that amazon doesn&#39;t make a profit because it shows their rationale is more complicated than you initially made it out to be. It has something to do with the bilderberg group&#39;s agenda, and the CIA&#39;s plans. But talking about those things would shatter the false equivalences you are trying to create.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You clearly haven&#39;t taken economics 101 yet. Amazon is run by investors, they know that their company can turn a profit if they want it to. If they shift their focus to making a profit, they could be a profitable company in less than 1 quarter. Instead they feel that the best approach is to keep prices low and expand market share. This will give them a larger piece of the pie in the future allowing for greater profits. They are investing their money to see greater returns along the line, not some secret CIA-bilderberg agenda. Its literally the same thing Sony/Microsoft do when releasing a new console, they sell the console at a loss to increase marketshare &amp; future revenue.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t share your laissez-faire attitude, and perhaps this is where our disagreement lies. I care how investments are made, and how wealth is expanded. It&#39;s one thing to invest in green technology or someone&#39;s education, it&#39;s another to invest in offshore drilling, fracking, or the surveillance industry. Some people expand their wealth by starting wars and profiting from mass murder. I hope you have at least a few qualms with that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about <a href="http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/16887-the-structural-genocide-that-is-capitalism">capitalism</a>, and &quot;the puzzling consent granted to this system by large swathes of the world&#39;s relatively privileged people.&quot; I think it should be criticized because millions of people have died due to its <a href="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html">violent, sacrificial logic</a>.</p>

<p>Not everyone has the same carbon footprint. Nor does everyone have the same capacity to effect change. Is it really making a sacrifice for billionaires to go without their yachts and extra mansions? Talking about that does not mean either of us is &#39;off the hook,&#39; nor does advocating for higher corporate tax rates or a more progressive tax system.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Billionaires are a small group of people, and it is possible to measure &#39;responsibility for wealth inequality&#39; in a way that downplays their influence and control. </p>

<p>Responsibility for wealth inequality is not just about the quantity of wealth one can redistribute, although that is important. Even though billionaires and millionaires can contribute more than everyone else, it is also important to consider <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ3xxwQvVnE">control</a>. Control of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6">the media</a> is used to keep the lower and middle classes fighting each other while the <a href="http://www.infiniteunknown.net/2013/11/23/the-worlds-2170-billionaires-control-33-trillion-in-net-worth-double-the-us-gdp/">rich</a> get <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bohhEOq.png">richer</a>. This is happening alongside &#39;austerity&#39; and cuts to social service programs like food stamps.</p>

<p>Your estimate of the net wealth of billionaires also downplays the role of the industries which manage and administer a pool of assets much, much larger than their net wealth. For instance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank_of_New_York_Mellon">bank of new york mellon</a> has over US$1.4 trillion in assets under management and US$27.69 trillion in assets under custody and administration. The assets of the global fund management industry total at around $117 trillion. That&#39;s half of the wealth you claim exists today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazon is run by investors... they are investing their money to see greater returns along the line, not some secret CIA-bilderberg agenda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t know that, and those things are not necessarily opposed. Amazon inked a $600 million cloud computing deal with the CIA <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rw7lx/is_no_one_else_concerned_that_the_amazon_drone/cdrlx6o">earlier this year</a>. Google provides the NSA with its cloud computing. Clearly the CIA and NSA trust these corporations to secure these machines.</p>

<p>Amazon and Google also happen to be developing and deploying mass-produced drone technology just like the U.S. military. CEOs of Amazon and Google happen to have attended bilderberg meetings. The CIA recruits many engineers and computer scientists at college campuses. Many of the people working for the CIA have another employer as a cover. As companies like Amazon and Google continue to develop drone technology, the CIA is going to reap the benefits of most if not all of the improvements that are made, especially when it comes to AI.</p>

It seems highly unlikely that miniaturised drone helicopters are going to be a more cost-effective means of delivering goods than a minimum-wage man in a van.

    <div class="md"><p>It could easily be 1 mechanic per amazon outlet. The things are built from parts that are cheaper to replace than repair (batteries, electric motors, cameras, sensors) so you don&#39;t need a crew working on them. With a airliner, you don&#39;t replace the entire engine if it stops working, but with a drone that small its cost effective to do so. So I could easily see 1 guy maintaining a fleet of 100 of those drones. </p>

<p>Even if 10% failed on a daily basis, that&#39;s 10 part repairs a day or 45 minutes to replace each part. </p>

<p>Failures probably won&#39;t typically happen at the repair shop. Someone will need to retrieve the failures.</p>

<p>I agree that this could reduce the number of people employed due to Amazon business just like any type of robotics reduces labor. It&#39;s a shame that the US education system is trending more toward creating delivery drivers and less toward creating robotic engineers every year.</p>

<p>They do that in Minneapolis.  They walk through the yards from house to house.   You actually have to shovel a path across your yard for them in the winter or you can be ticketed.</p>

<p>I had a car that, while it had both types of locks, you really couldn&#39;t grab the lock mechanism manually while it was in the locked position, effectively sticking you with only electronic locks. I didn&#39;t notice it before I bought it, but it was one of the reasons I kept a window breaking device in the car.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just about exploiting the technology. If you lose power in the vehicle, you&#39;re basically trapped in. It&#39;s really hard to break automotive glass without applying lots of force with something hard and pointy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, right?</p>

<p>We should have the freedom of contract and if we don&#39;t like our phone company or cable company, we should just drop them and go with a company that treats us well.  Same with insurance companies.  It&#39;s up to consumers to do the research and shop for the best deal.  Free market capitalism will be a sufficient restraint on bad behvaior.</p>

<p>And if they screw you over you can always call and complain and they will spend hours pretending to listen to your concerns without doing much.  Well, they may issue a gift card that just makes it slightly better--payable in 8 to 10 weeks.  And if that fails you can sue them . . . well, actually, you gave that right away (did you read the fine print?) and you can go to arbitration where you don&#39;t stand a chance and have to pay their lawyer bills if you lose.  Hey, don&#39;t like it?  Do some research on the internet and hope you don&#39;t fall prey to a &quot;consumer rights&quot; site that is actually paid for by industry with the intention of heading any of you troublemakers off.</p>

<p>Yeah, the free market is the best way to look out for customers.  If some Bozo makes a billion dollars it&#39;s probably because he <del>is really good at suckering/entrapping victims</del> provided a service that was mutually beneficial to all parties.</p>

<p>And I prefer &quot;free-marketeer&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started to count, on my fingers, the number of ways that this could go horribly wrong. I ran out of fingers.</p>

<p>I imagine the lawyers at Amazon are buzzing with the ramifications of delivering packages autonomously to random remote locations, and doing it without losing the drone to overhead cables or overenthusiastic gunowners, and without killing anybody.</p>

<p>In fact, the number of ways this could fail is infinite. The whole scheme is a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the real purpose of it? To get us accepting and even enthusiastic about the idea of little undermanned helicopters whizzing around above our heads. That&#39;s all it can be. And once we&#39;ve accepted them, they will be used against us.</p>

At first I was thinking of the money they would save over a truck but it really wouldn&#39;t be that efficient as it&#39;s not like you could load nearly as much stuff on a drone.

    <div class="md"><p>Government and police forces will already have their own drones.  In my opinion the more private people/institutions employing drones the better.  This means that the government won&#39;t have a monopoly on drones they way they do on violence.  Drones have to become mainstream the same way that telephones, guns, cars and frozen pizza have.  It&#39;s a new technology with amazing and incredible potential and also very dangerous potential, just like guns, cars, and not so much frozen pizza but you get my point.  We&#39;re going to see them in our lives, that&#39;s not backdooring that&#39;s just new technology spreading. What would be of greater concern is if the government said we don&#39;t have a right to use drones in the civilian sector.  Bezos is no peach, but at least you have one giant keeping drones in civilian hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a little late to this one, but I think drones for everyone might be a real possibility in ten years, and it might be a great equalizer of sorts. If anyone has read Iain Banks, you might recall knife missiles. Essentially it&#39;s an AI in a small drone about the size and shape of a four inch long double ended knife blade, but a little fat in the middle. </p>

<p>It is rather intriguing to imagine a drone as a constant companion. </p>

<p>Imagine in 20 years you have a drone the size of a humming bird, one of the really really small species, not much bigger than a large bumble bee. It is your smart phone and a drone. Perhaps not AI, but dumb-smart enough to make Siri look like a phonograph. It stays with you always hovering nearby monitoring and recording everything around you. It can respond to sub-vocalized commands and inputs visuals directly to a heads up display embedded in a contact lense. It has radar, FLIR, GPS. When social conduct dictates, it flies into your shirt pocket or lands unobtrusively on your shoulder and goes to standby. It can alert authorities if you are in danger, and inversely alert you to the presence of authorities. In emergency situations it can defend you as an impact weapon. It will have software that detects aggression before you even realize you&#39;re in trouble. Although it&#39;s body is made of carbon nanotubes and is extremely light weight, it is yet very stiff--essentially a projectile capable of 60mph top speed and thus poses a significant deterrent. Or in the alternative it can seek help. It will be your baby monitor. It will watch the kids in the yard and feed video to you. It will play with the cat when not needed. It will inspect the garden before you get out of bed and let you know it&#39;s time to pick tomatoes. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all going to have drones eventually. The question is will it be an equalizer? Will they make police and others accountable? Will drones become like the Internet--developed by the military, commercialized and then democratized by the people? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about: I&#39;m the NSA. I know you just ordered something from Amazon. It will arrive in 30 minutes. I hack into the drone, send it back; and I send my drone that looks similar. You take the package, open it; and BAM. You&#39;re dead. Then I send people to clean up. And no one knows your missing until someone calls 911 two or three days or weeks later. Brilliant. These guys are geniuses. I&#39;m thinking of going to the dark side with them. It is far more entertaining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO @ this stage Amazon is just using overpriced currently non feasible prototype idea hype to appear more advanced than they are. PR hype much alike prototypes @ car shows of which <strong>most fail to be delivered</strong> in any near future.</p>

<p>I do not see this as a soon to be large scale reality:</p>

<p>A 5 pound package falls on a human from high above.</p>

<p>Cries of foul that poor areas are not serviced.</p>

<p>In most all dense urban areas door delivery would be impossible &amp; only rooftop heliport penthouse illetes would be serviceable.</p>

<p>Amazon ships so many packages the sky would be full of too many potential packages falling upon people, making such accidents possibly daily occurrences. </p>

<p>How wide of /many frequency channels would amazon need to own? As I comprehend it RC units such as these require multiple channels or cross communication info becomes an issue.</p>

<p>Who the fuck is going to drive the drones? Are they going to team with googles self driving car tech? This would be much more a pain in the ass to to program IMO.</p>

<p>Weather [wind rain hail snow] would pummel the shit out of the drones they have shown.</p>

<p>I think this PR prototype hype is going to be super expensive &amp; only done to service rural rich routes &amp; likely only for a short period of time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in Amazon using them because delivery that rapidly seems really cool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused. Why am I supposed to be worried about Amazon? Besides their insanely low prices and the fact that they carry pretty much everything I&#39;ve ever needed, I&#39;ve never felt threatened by them. In fact, their customer service has always been pretty good. Returns are hassle free.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m looking forward to their new drone delivery service. As soon as that little helicopter lands on my lawn, I&#39;m gonna hit it with a bat and throw it in a bag and use it for parts. Its like order a few phone case, get a free drone.</p>

<p>Seems unlikely.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Also seems unlikely. They&#39;ll probably fly high enough to avoid running into things like trees and houses and people and stuff, then descend at their destination to deliver their package.</p>

<p>Also, one wonders just how big or small they might be. Probably not truck-sized, but it might take a fairly big piece of aircraft to deliver a 35-60 pound box, right?</p>

<p>Really, taking a swing at a drone would be more justifiable if it was a police drone. If enough of them get taken out and the cost for replacing the fleet continually goes up, maybe the police departments that use/will use these things will cut their losses and stop using them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let&#39;s think about this for a second. Personally, I like Amazon&#39;s services and I think that if this is truly possible on a grand scale this is a great thing. I would be proud to support some form of technology that alleviates drudgery for all of those delivery people. </p>

<p>With that said, OP does have a point. but, we need to realize that not every form of technology is looking to do us harm, for technology is inherently neutral. I think what you&#39;re getting at, OP, is that we as a society cannot be this ass backwards about the technology we employ. Drone Strikes are currently killing a ton of people every day, needlessly, but at the same time does that make the use of automated vehicles reprehensible? I say no. </p>

<p>I also think that we are all visiting this subreddit because we know that what OP is talking about is entirely possible (you would be a fool to think that it is not) if no action is taken to prevent it. So, here we are. I hope that we decide to act when our hour is upon us.</p>

<p>Its called the future. What did you expect.  Law enforcement technology is not going to stay in the twentieth century.  Get over it.  Police in most big cities already have drones.  They are not looking inside your house, they are patrolling outside, just like cops with cars and helicopters have been doing for decades.  Drones allow them to do their job more effectively and for less money.</p>

<p>Same goes for all the facial recognition shit that they will be employing.  What did you expect.  Law enforcement technology is going to continue advancing with the times.  Cop cars already scan license plates and put the locations of your car in a database, no one really cares about that.  If this stuff increases the arrest rate for murders and rapes im all for it.  They are not violating my privacy and I am not planning on committing any crimes.</p>

<p>You are talking about two different entities though. How is Amazon using technology to speed up shipping the same as the government killing people? It&#39;s like saying we can&#39;t have airlines because the government will use planes to drop bombs.

    <div class="md"><p>A true free market does not exist but we do have a quasi-free market (not a real free market i know). Amazon producing shipping drones is not the government creating mainstream acceptance. In the interview, the Amazon CEO even said the government will be the one to slow down the process to make it a reality. Why would the government slow it down if it wanted to make it mainstream? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how using drones to ship packages will make people more accepting of using drones to kill. It&#39;s not like people using guns to hunt for food makes the public more accepting of people using guns to kill people. The technology is not the problem, the way you use it is. And if the people can&#39;t see the difference between using technology to ship faster and using it to kill people, then we have much bigger problems. </p>

<p>Why? Subsidizing rural life just makes more people live there, which means that the subsidies must continue forever. It leads to permanent inefficiencies. If people want the rural life, fine, but they shouldn&#39;t expect others to pay for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not subsidizing all rural life . . . just a certain aspect of it.  Mail delivery, cable, phone, internet and health care should be delivered to all citizens equally imo.  This is based on fairness.  Same with school buses.  Rural kids should have the same access to schools even though it costs more to bus them there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It hurts because wealth is redistributed inefficiently, which is a drain on economic growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, &quot;redistribution&quot; of wealth is a buzzword that drives me up the wall.  All economic systems redistribute wealth.  Laissez faire capitalism does this as well . . . the power of capital allows the wealth of the lower classes to be hoovered upwards.</p>

<p>Organizing an economy so that there are lots of middle class workers, be it postal workers or clerks in ma and pa stores, is much better for the vast majority of people.  We are all a lot better off paying slightly more for U.S. goods and services in ma and pa stores than we are paying less for crap made in China.  Efficiency is not always the best goal.  We can have children slave laborers and drones make cheap goods for the 10% of Americans that still have any purchasing power in a neo feudal capitalist society and this may be &quot;efficient&quot; but it&#39;s not a just or good situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fine, you do it then. I do mind, and I&#39;d rather opt out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Providing jobs in certain sectors does not preclude others from holding private jobs.  While I would like to see the number of jobs provided by the government expand (mostly in health care, but also things like national parks, postal workers, and newly nationalized industries like internet and some banking services) I would like to see a stronger privatized sector in other areas (like the ma and pa stores we&#39;re talking about here trying to compete with Amazon and Walmart or in farming).  I would love to truly see small business supported more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Privatizing means lower expenses, because there are incentives to lower expenses. Public sector corporations with monopoly privilege (USPS) have little incentive to do better with the money they have because they can&#39;t go out of business and they have no real competition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, they have lower expenses because they do not have the same mission to treat customers and employees with the same level of respect.  Efficiency not only ignores the quality that customers get and the deal employees get, but it ignores the profit wrung out of the system.  Walmart is hella profitable but instead of this profit being shared amongst a whole middle class of shopkeepers it is in the hands of very few people.  This is not good &quot;efficiency.&quot;  Efficiency is not always good.</p>

<p>The illustrated story looks well done.  I&#39;ll try to look it over if I have more time but I can already tell I disagree with some of the assumptions . . . like capitalist investment is necessary to grow an economy . . . or the idea that greed is good.  This is capitalist propaganda imho.  Don&#39;t have time to rebut it but I think there are certain sectors where other forms of organization other than laissez faire capitalism are superior.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I had a car that, while it had both types of locks, you really couldn&#39;t grab the lock mechanism manually while it was in the locked position, effectively sticking you with only electronic locks.

    <div class="md"><p>Ha.  It&#39;s a virtuous cycle.</p>

<p>Actually, if anything Congress taking money away from the USPS (from Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The USPS has not directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters.[6] Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume,[7] after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act,[8] (which mandated $5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to pre-fund retiree health-care, 75 years into the future, a requirement unique among organizations and businesses in the U.S.[9]), revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced[10] declining mail volume,[11] prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit.[12] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;d much rather spend that money on high speed internet than on blowing up brown people, your comment presumes that the government could actually provide that service for that many people for that price. As with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/YourTaxDollarsAtWork">nearly all government programs</a>, the cost would far exceed initial projects, and the quality would be much worse.</p>

<p>And what about all the people who don&#39;t care about internet access, or maybe don&#39;t care if it&#39;s slow. Why should they be forced to pay for yours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk about begging for buzzwords. </p>

<p>Genocide is: &quot;the <strong>deliberate</strong> and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an <strong>ethnic, racial, caste, religious, or national group</strong>&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cars are responsible for about 20% of the U.S.&#39;s carbon emissions... and may have genocidal consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edited for emphasis. </p>

<p>There is no way that carbon emissions from cars are systematically destroying/killing a targeted group of people. You are claiming that the byproduct of a industry created a century ago was is deliberate, targeting a specific group of people. The effects of carbon emissions were not even known 100 years ago, let alone the beginning of a deliberate mass murder of some unidentified group of people. </p>

<p>I seriously doubt that. I&#39;m not from the US, but most civilized countries have laws against taking photos through people windows. Most photo-journalists are aware of this f.ex. Any lawyers present to back this up? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am critiquing drone technology in other ways, if you look at what I&#39;ve said in the rest of this thread that&#39;ll become clear. You&#39;ve picked out one statement of mine you don&#39;t like. Fine. Wealth and energy inequality IS a problem. I don&#39;t deny that I need to make sacrifices. So do you.</p>

<p>If you really felt we were irredeemably selfish for having phones and computers, you&#39;d make the sacrifices you&#39;re asking me to make. You&#39;re in the same position I am. However, you are not criticizing the system that makes this possible, you&#39;re using your critique to shield billionaires from criticism, as if they did not have far more ability to make sacrifices that would do something about global wealth inequality. </p>

<p>It matters that amazon doesn&#39;t make a profit because it shows their rationale is more complicated than you initially made it out to be. It has something to do with the bilderberg group&#39;s agenda, and the CIA&#39;s plans. But talking about those things would shatter the false equivalences you are trying to create.</p>
