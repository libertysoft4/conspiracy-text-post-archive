        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Thomas Ogle (1953–1981) was an American inventor. He designed and implemented a &quot;vapor carburetor&quot; that allowed an ordinary carburetor engine to achieve 70+ miles to the gallon of gasoline using only gasoline vapors. Thomas Ogle was harassed by power-hungry oil companies that were persistent to terminate his research and stifle the progress of highly-efficient technology for internal combustion engine vehicles. Thomas Ogle&#39;s death in 1983 was most likely due to the action of certain personnel involved with the oil companies.
His invention made it possible to drastically reduce fuel consumption.
In April 30, 1977 he made a consumption test on a 1970 Ford Galaxie linking El Paso to Deming in New Mexico.
His invention was widely publicized in local newspapers of El Paso, Texas.
Patent. Tom Ogle&#39;s Vapor Fuel System.
 US Patent # 4,177,779 Fuel Economy System for an Internal Combustion Engine
 Tom Ogle (December 11, 1979)
Abstract ~
A fuel economy system for an internal combustion engine which, when installed in a motor vehicle, obviates the need for a conventional carburetor, fuel pump and gasoline tank. The system operates by using the engine vacuum to draw fuel vapors from a vapor tank through a vapor conduit to a vapor equalizer which is positioned directly over the intake manifold of the engine. The vapor tank is constructed of heavy duty steel or the like to withstand the large vacuum pressure and includes an air inlet valve coupled for control to the accelerator pedal. The vapor equalizer ensures distribution of the correct mixture of air and vapor to the cylinders of the engine for combustion, and also includes its own air inlet valve coupled for control to the accelerator pedal. The system utilizes vapor-retarding filters in the vapor conduit, vapor tank and vapor equalizer to deliver the correct vapor/air mixture for proper operation. The vapor tank and fuel contained therein are heated by running the engine coolant through a conduit within the tank. Due to the extremely lean fuel mixtures used by the present invention, gas mileage in excess of one hundred miles per gallon may be achieved.
Inventors: Ogle; Thomas H. W. W. P. (9028 Mt. Delano, El Paso, TX 79924) Current U.S. Class: 123/522; 261/DIG83 ~ Intern&#39;l Class: F02M 031/00 Field of Search: 123/133,34 A,122 E,134,136 48/180 R 261/144,145
 He had to undergo an assassination attempt (shot and injured by bullet) outside a bar that no one could identify the perpetrator. A few months later he was found dead. He had previously told his lawyer, Bobby Perel, he thought they drugged their drinks, especially in the bar where he was playing billiards. On August 19, 1981, Ogle died of a overdose of Darvon, a painkiller, and alcohol, according to autopsy.</p>

<p>&quot;Ogle Fuel System - No Hoax&quot;  By Gregory Jones
Tom Ogle says it wasn&#39;t a hoax.
He insists there were no hidden fuel tanks or other alternate fuel sources used to power a two-ton automobile for 205 miles Saturday on only two gallons of gasoline fumes.
Ogle isn&#39;t alone in his no-hoax statements.
Carl Wright, for example, has been working on internal combustion machines for 35 years. He is a certified teacher of auto mechanics and is currently shop foreman at Peck&#39;s Automotive Service, where Ogle built his controversial energy-saving fuel system.
&quot;It&#39;s no hoax.&quot; Wright said in straight-forward fashion. &quot;There were no hidden tanks.&quot; Wright, who has no vested interests in the invention, said at first he was skeptical of the young man&#39;s invention.
&quot;I&#39;ve watched the thing from the time they built the fuel tank to the very present,&quot; Wright said, &quot;It looks to me like it&#39;ll do what Tom said it would do.&quot;
Wright said any secret fuel compartments would have required many extra man-hours by Ogle to install in the car body.
&quot;He only worked on the car during office hours,&quot; Wright said,&quot;and he didn&#39;t have a key to the door&quot; to get into the automotive shop during off-hours or weekends.
Experts Probe Ogle Fuel System
&quot;He has not been here working on the car at nights, and the car has been locked up here every night.&quot; Wright said.
James Peck, who owns Peck&#39;s Automotive, has a 50-50 partnership on any royalties from the invention. And he said he would stake his 30 year professional reputation in northeast EI Paso on the fact that there was no hoax involved in Saturday&#39;s test drive.
&quot;I personally believe he (Ogle) had some help some-where along the way developing the system, although he will not admit to that. But I can vouch that the system works. It&#39;s no hoax. It was my car hr converted. We built system in my shop. I&#39;ll put my name on the line. It definitely works.
Peck said he provided financial back for Ogle&#39;s invention after he and Ogle met about a month ago and discussed the system.
Frank Haynes Jr. is registered state engineer with degrees from the University of Texas at Austin and Southern Methodist University. He was at Peck&#39;s Automotive Saturday where he looked the system over and talked with Ogle.
&quot;From what I saw, there was no hoax.&quot; Haynes said, adding that he learned of Ogle&#39;s invention in The Times.
&quot; I decided to venture out and see what was going on,&quot; he said. &quot; I&#39;d never even heard of Tom Ogle before. But I&#39;m familiar with combustion from previous work and wondered what the kid had come up with.
&quot;What I saw was very convincing,&quot; Haynes said. Haynes said he felt the only chance of a hoax might have been in the amount of fuel that actually was in the tank.
Prior to the test drive Saturday, reporters and onlookers witnessed a mechanic at Peck&#39;s empty the special, pressurized gas tanks, and pour two gallons of fuel into the tank after it was empty.
Haynes said he was additionally convinced of the system&#39;s authenticity by the fact it was difficult to start the car before heading to Deming.
&quot;The car had to be primed quite thoroughly in order to run. That gave me the idea that there weren<code>t any fumes in the system after drainage.
&quot;That was quite convincing for me personally. If there had been hidden fuel, there wouldn</code>t have been any difficulty in starting the car, according to how he (Ogle) described the system to me,&quot; Haynes said.
Haynes described Ogle as an &quot;open, earnest young man who convinced me everything he said should be true.&quot;
Ogle all along has maintained nothing but simple trust in his invention.
&quot;It works,&quot; he said frankly. &quot;There is no hoax.&quot;
He described his Saturday test drive, in which a times reporter participated as a &quot;beautiful performance.&quot;
Ogle added with a chuckle that the return to El Paso from Deming was made with one pint and two ounces of fuel left in the fuel tank.
&quot;We did pretty good though. We made 205 miles on less than two gallons,&quot; he added.
He said he maintained constant 55 to 60 mile per hour speeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a modern way to do this. An ultrasonic fogger will make gasoline fog atomized much finer than the best fuel injectors. But creating a carburetor from scratch is to hard. 
So you take a carburated car. Block off the pilot jet system, controls idle to 1/4 throttle. Create enough gas fog to make the engine idle at a proper mixture. 
The engine will run on fog until 1/4 throttle or more is applied. Then the liquid fuel will kick in. The majority of driving will be under 1/4 throttle.
This will take advantage of fuel vapor without having complicated fuel metering problems. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8oQf7yXQ1A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8oQf7yXQ1A</a></p>

<p>Except about death: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tom Ogle died August 19, 1981, at the age of 26, attributed to alcohol and a drug overdose. Not long before his death, an associate had been killed when a car they were working on fell off its jack. Ogle closed the shop and apparently turned to drugs and gambling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I built a small carb like this for a class project years ago. I was able to run an MG for nearly 90 miles on a gallon of gas. Funny thing is: it&#39;s simple!! Anyone with a bit of auto knowledge that can weld can build one!</p>

<p>I had issues with the engine running too lean (and hot) but knowing what I know today I&#39;d bet I could lick those old issues. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled...it DOES work and work well.</p>
