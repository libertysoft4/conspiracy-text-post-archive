        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just want to say that this sub Reddit, along with some elements of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a>, did a great job keeping people informed about the Britam leaks relating to an impending false flag, chemical weapons attack that happened in Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus. The best part was that people seemed to know exactly when it was going to happen and right as Assad&#39;s forces began gaining momentum, like clockwork, it did. We informed ourselves and others and because of it, 91% of American citizens and 75% of US soldiers, said no to intervention in Syria (I know we didn&#39;t do all the work but we got a large portion of Reddit to espouse the truth).</p>

<p>However, this latest deal with Iran is not really a loss for Israel, the US just had no other way out. We&#39;re not fooling anyone, anymore. We know Iran isn&#39;t trying to build a nuke, we even confirmed this in 2011 and found that Iran wasn&#39;t even breaking any rules with their current nuclear program. Also, people are catching onto the fact that Israel has been saying this for thirty years and that if it hasn&#39;t happened yet, it&#39;s never going to happen. </p>

<p>This is how I see it playing out. There will be a massive, false flag, terror attack on a major US city and we will immediately &quot;know&quot; that it was Iran. Netanyahu will wag his finger at puppet Obama and our administration will pretend to be ashamed of not listening to the all-knowing, supreme Netanyahu. </p>

<p>The reality is, at this point, Israel cannot take Iran by themselves. I laugh every time I hear that Israel might strike Iran, as if Iran is going to take it sitting down. Israel has the 34th largest army and Iran has the ninth largest. Israel would have to worry about Egypt to the south, Hezbollah to the north and support from Assad/Russia. As well, Iran now has Iraq&#39;s airspace. Israel was not even capable of taking on Hezbollah in 2006, so to put it simply, they&#39;d be crushed and ground into dust within a week, if they touched Iran. So, as you can imagine, we should probably be expecting something big to happen soon. Just keep your eyes peeled. Remember, a nuclear weapon has more than likely gone missing on US soil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question time: Why would Iran even nuke America? I know we have had poor relations with them in the past due to questionable actions on both sides. But, aren&#39;t we the least of their worries? I mean they live in the middle east; what I consider the &quot;wild west&quot; of the world. We just significantly eased sanctions against them adding billions back to their revenue. So why would this deal lead to nuking the US? That in itself would point at an attack being from a source other than Iran.</p>

<p>Israel has Nukes, and they will use them.</p>

<p>but as for the FF you are right on. I think it will be something to take the power grid down in the middle of December when it will do the most damage. I also believe that it will be back east as that is where it will do the most damage.</p>

<p>on the Israel issue, watch the Senate as they are owned by the Zionists. if the democratic senators start speaking out against Obama then the fix is in from the Holy land.</p>

However, they could turn the sanctions tables on Israel and establish a pretty strong boycott of companies doing business with Israel over the nuclear and Palestine issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree except with the fact that Israel will be defeated. I&#39;v been following Sheikh Imran Hossein&#39;s videos and although he understands how evil Israel is, he says that in the end times many nations will attack Israel and Israel will not fall. The whole world in fact will be at war.</p>

<p>After Israel survives and the world calms down there should come and individual born in Israel who will be seen as the messiah by many (or perhaps the world calms down because of him). However according to the Quran he will be the false messiah (aka anti-christ) he will unite the world (one world government). And only after all of this will come the return of Christ (what ever that means). </p>

<p>If I had to guess it will take about 30 years for all of this to play out if not more. The end game is still far far away.</p>

<p>Now what I&#39;m saying might not be true, but it benefits us all to keep in mind the different versions of the end times, so that we can monitor as we go through history and start seeing which ones are playing out. </p>

<p>The orthodox Christians have a similar view of the end times, still many many years before it all unfolds. </p>

<p>This chronology for some reason makes complete sense to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First there will be massive unrest on earth</p></li>
<li><p>Then a person will rise and unite the world, but he will not be the real messiah</p></li>
<li><p>After people totally fall for this and the world starts drastically changing (everything will start to look like the golden age, as if we made it through the worst) people will go with the system and eventually suffer tremendously.</p></li>
<li><p>Only then will come the true messiah.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The anti-christ will be accepted by many people/religions to be the messiah, it&#39;s even possible that people reading this subreddit will get tricked, the holy books say that many many people will believe. How else can one man exert such power? He must be believed by 90% of the world if not more. Right now you say to yourself, &quot;I will see through all of this once it occurs&quot; but don&#39;t be cocky, the world will be in such a dark place that people will probably hate you for not trusting the messiah. Everything will be extremely convincing, and when you refuse (although you have no real evidence for the claim) you will be seen as the degenerate of the world.</p>

<p>People who survive long periods of extreme harsh living are very easily marshaled when hope seems to show its head. They will be extatic, you might be too, even I might be. Theres no telling how your mind operates after the horrors it has gone through. It&#39;s in this time that the number of the beast will be carried by people. The number of the beast is never going to come before the great war, we live too luxuriously and indulge in philosophy. When you loose half of your family, when you barely have food, you become a different person. You will accept all for the end of suffering. </p>

<p>Only those people that remain unshook by the happenings (those who have a peaceful heart and who are very close to god) will be mentally clear enough to see it all. Most people, and all materialists will be swept away. Because how can a materialist possibly remain clear when all that he believes in becomes darker than the greatest evil he has ever faced. It&#39;s impossible, only those devoted ones who cling to the undying can maintain clarity of mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question time: Why would Iran even nuke America? I know we have had poor relations with them in the past due to questionable actions on both sides. But, aren&#39;t we the least of their worries? I mean they live in the middle east; what I consider the &quot;wild west&quot; of the world. We just significantly eased sanctions against them adding billions back to their revenue. So why would this deal lead to nuking the US? That in itself would point at an attack being from a source other than Iran.</p>
