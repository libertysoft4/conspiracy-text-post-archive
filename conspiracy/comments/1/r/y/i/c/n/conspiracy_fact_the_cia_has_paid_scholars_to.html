<p>CIA past involvement with academia,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In one of the Harvard instances, the CIA paid a professor $107,430 to write a book on Saudi Arabia. There were two conditions. The payment was not to be revealed (except presumably to the Internal Revenue Service), and the CIA got to clear the book in advance. <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/1986/0402/ecia.html">Source</a></p>

<p>CONSPIRACY THEORY: </p>

<p>The CIA paid Steven Pinker to write this book “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,” <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=history-and-the-decline-of-human-violence">Article discussing the book.</a></p>

<p>It was published in 2011 and received wide acclaim and media attention.</p>

<p>Now there is this reddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/1rwvjd/the_world_isnt_as_fragile_as_the_us_thinks_how/">thread</a>  discussing BusinessWeek&#39;s article &quot;The World Isn&#39;t As Fragile as the U.S. Thinks&quot; <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-02/the-u-dot-s-dot-should-treat-poorer-countries-as-trade-partners-not-pariahs#r=rss">Article</a></p>

<p>Call it a hunch, but this guy, Steve Pinker, is a shill, and this book and subsequent articles are just pieces in the whole propaganda machine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too pat, too easy &quot;Hey, look, the world is a better place!!!&quot;. It dismisses the world&#39;s structural violence, more than 1 billion people living without clean water <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-global-poverty">[source]</a>, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats#src4">[source]</a>, whatever, I could go on, alarming loss of species diversity aka biocide, global climate change, etc.</p>

<p>Go to sleep sheeple, the world is a peaceful place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t just an isolated case. There are hundreds of paid mouthpieces who lecture at universities who are covertly sponsored through foundations or agencies like the CIA.</p>

<p>When the Church Committee investigated the intelligence agencies in 1976 it found the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency is now using several hundred American academics (&quot;academics&quot; includes administrators, faculty members and graduate students engaged in teaching), who in addition to providing leads and, on occasion, making introductions for intelligence purposes, occasionally write books and other material to be used for propaganda purposes abroad. Beyond these, an additional few score are used in an unwitting manner for minor activities.</p>

<p>These academics are located in over 100 American colleges, universities, and related institutes. At the majority of institutions, no one other than the individual concerned is aware of the CIA link. At the others, at least one university official is aware of the operational use made of academics on his campus. In addition, there are several American academics abroad who serve operational purposes, primarily the collection of intelligence. <em>pages 189-190</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Sometime in the 80s, I believe, the CIA made a college degree a prerequisite to employment with the Agency. So, in terms of presence and recruitment on campus, it&#39;s not a big surprise.</p>

<p>The undisclosed use of academics for propaganda purposes, that&#39;s a good one, that&#39;s pretty clever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think I might have nailed this one, that my hunch may actually be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting story. </p>

<p>David Sarnoff was one of the fathers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sarnoff#World_War_II">Radio Free Europe</a> during WWII before it became a more permanent entity in 1949 when it was seeded with CIA funds.  And as the head of RCA, a huge media company, I suspect he had intelligence ties as well.  </p>

<p>He has a fascinating story.  Basically the Navy controlled radio technology in the 1910s and spun off RCA at the end of WWI and made this young immigrant the head of the company.   Seems like one of the first examples of the government spinning out a technology it developed and controlled . . . putting the company putatively in private hands while maybe serving more sinister purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen revelations from that book.</p>

<p>Sarnoff also had connections to Joe Kennedy in the 1920s I believe.  </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve been most interested in is the history of &quot;wireless radio&quot; communication in the 1910s.  Sarnoff came out of (relative) nowhere and was known for helping the New York Times scoop the Titanic story in 1912 (even though <a href="http://davidsarnoff.pages.tcnj.edu/2013/08/30/radio-to-the-rescue-david-sarnoff-and-the-titanic-disaster/">it&#39;s claimed he exaggerated his role</a>).  He helped intercept raw radio transmissions and not only did this help the 21 year old immigrant from a poor Jewish family rise to power, it showed the world the power of radio communications and also demonstrated the importance of signals intelligence.  The New York Times was able to get the accurate story (from Sarnoff&#39;s transmissions), the story goes, while most other newspapers were led astray by White Star Lines representatives and falsely claimed everyone was rescued and the ship hadn&#39;t sunk.  </p>

<p>The Navy had always developed this technology and then during WWI it was nationalized because if its military significance.  After the war the various corporate interests and the military spun off its interests and combined to create RCA that became the industry leader.  RCA would also go on to dominate other areas of the media, like music.  He is also known as the father of <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989773,00.html">broadcasting television</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of how Tesla&#39;s radio technology was sidestepped in the 1910s by Marconi (who Sarnoff worked for) and others.  </p>

<p>This wireless technology has always been militarized and even though there were a number of private companies vying for a piece of the pie and inventing tech the military dominated.  </p>

<p>Sarnoff went on to propose, and took a leading role in, radio propaganda, which led to Radio Free Europe.  He was also involved with foreign policy with David Rockefeller. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The artists themselves were completely unaware that their work was being used as propaganda. On what agents called a “long leash,” they participated in several exhibitions secretly organized by the CIA, such as “The New American Painting” (see catalog cover at top), which visited major European cities in 1958-59 and included such modern primitive works as surrealist William Baziotes’ 1947 Dwarf (below). <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/04/how_the_cia_turned_american_abstract_expressionism_into_cold_war_propaganda.html">Source.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to note that the Soviets had their own <a href="http://www.internationalarts.org/CW%20Wood%20Essay%20Revolt.pdf">modern art propaganda house</a> shortly after the Bolsheviks took power.  And it was later alleged that these same (Jewish) Bolsheviks influenced modern art in Munich, which led the National Socialists to denounce these art movements as &quot;degenerate art.&quot; </p>

<p>Modern Art was later supported in America after WWII (as your link and new revelations evidently show) but before the war the hotbeds appear to be Munich and Paris.  </p>

<p>Interesting that these allegations are only surfacing now so long after the fact.  To modern American ears the politics of art sounds foreign but it looks like it was a big deal at the time.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to locate a copy of Grand Wood&#39;s article shortly before WWII where he criticizes modern art but can&#39;t locate it.  He reacted against modern art and helped develop regionalism (<a href="http://www.internationalarts.org/CW%20Wood%20Essay%20Revolt.pdf">here it is</a>, his 1935 &#39;Revolt Against the City.&#39;)  </p>

<p>I see subtle hints of the sensitive politics in his essay but doubt it could be freely discussed in America.  Be interesting to do more research about the politics of art during this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t how it works. The CIA is good at being the CIA. So they need info to help understand how Saudi Arabia works and maybe plan and adjust to what they might do. It&#39;s a lot better for them to go find a scholar who is obsessed with say, Middle East history and culture (not saying that&#39;s what this guy&#39;s specialty is) then try and have some intern  draw up a report on SA. Pay a scholar $100k to sit on his duff for a year and give you the most up to date, comprehensive work on SA. With them clearing things, it would be assumed someone good at what they do might find things that are either wrong or maybe we don&#39;t want told to everyone. All states have secrets and it blows my mind people don&#39;t understand this. So good book gets written about SA, US scholarly work gets contributed to, the CIA has an up to date educational reference on SA, SA now knows what the US knows and thinks about it, sounds fine to me. </p>

<p>Or yea, ya&#39; now, the CIA made them write what they want, a scholar able to get this big of a contract would be co-opted easily, because then all those Americans who who read books about SA absorb it, the narrative changes to what the CIA wants people to think about SA so they can?????</p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming the CIA at all has completely altruistic reasons for doing this, but ALL NATION STATES DO THIS STUFF AND ITS NOT A BIG SECRET! Read the book. Read lots of the amazing history and culture books that come out every year. Go to your local college and get in the bottom of the library and find the old weird history and culture books and see what people used to think and how academic narratives work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good discussion and good instincts.  I too am skeptical of this guy&#39;s packaging and his slick message.</p>

<p>I notice he makes this claim which I don&#39;t think is supported by recent experience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the international arena, peacekeepers are demonstrably effective—not 100 percent of the time, but more often than when adversaries are left to fight to the bitter end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UN and Western imposed peacekeepers impose Western hegemony on the world . . . they are not impartial peacekeepers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also dubious of the claims that the past was way more violent although I&#39;ve seen this claim elsewhere.  I would like to evaluate the evidence for these claims in more detail.  The torture methods sure do seem cruel but how common was this?  Also, was battle really waged to the death and how common was this and what is the evidence?  Was it really worse than WWII for instance?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a critique of his Pinker&#39;s evidence for his claims that prehistoric man was more violent, as well as a critic of his other facts:  <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-dawn/201103/steven-pinkers-stinker-the-origins-war">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-dawn/201103/steven-pinkers-stinker-the-origins-war</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/reality-denial-apologetics-for-western-imperial-violence">Reality Denial : Apologetics for Western-Imperial Violence</a>&quot;, a review of Pinker&#39;s book by Edward S. Herman and David Peterson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pinker’s ideological thinking stresses the development of positive and humane attitudes by individuals—in the Civilized states—moving them towards humane policy, opposition to slavery, concern for civilians in war, and moves toward democracy, while he essentially ignores the development of institutional forces that might overwhelm these individual factors and make for serious violence.</p>

<p>In addition to his neglect of “aggressive commerce” and cross-border seizures of people, property, and resources, Pinker ignores the post-World War II growth of U.S. militarism, with its vested interests in weapons and warfare, and the expanding and self-reinforcing power of the ”iron triangle” of the military-industrial-complex to shape national policy.  This may be why he never mentions, let alone discusses, the classics on this topic by Seymour Melman, Gordon Adams, Richard Kaufman, and Tom Gervasi,[36] or the more recent work of Chalmers Johnson, Andrew Bacevich, Henry Giroux, Nick Turse, and Winslow Wheeler.[37]  These very knowledgeable individuals believe that Eisenhower’s warning in his 1960 Farewell Address about the threat of the military-industrial complex was on target, that the United States is dominated by an institutional structure with a huge vested interest in war rather than peace, and one that has succeeded in making this country into a war-demanding and war-making system.  These and other analysts have also featured the encroachment of the permanent-war system on civil liberties and democracy,[38] suggesting that any neo-Fukuyaman perspective on “end-of-history” liberalism and Pinker’s streaky but steady decline in violence is Panglossian nonsense grounded in ideological thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And much much more, it&#39;s a very extensive and scathing review.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>On 2nd September, 1914, soon after the start of the First World War, the Liberal politician, Charles Masterman, the <strong>head of the War Propaganda Bureau</strong>, organised a <strong>secret meeting</strong> of Britain&#39;s leading writers to discuss ways of best promoting Britain&#39;s interests during the war. Those who attended to discuss the best way of promoting Britain&#39;s interests during the war included Conan Doyle, Arnold Bennett, John Masefield, Ford Madox Ford, William Archer, G. K. Chesterton, Sir Henry Newbolt, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Gilbert Parker, G. M. Trevelyan and H. G. Wells.</p>

<p>All the writers present at the conference agreed to the utmost secrecy, and it was not until 1935 that the activities of the War Propaganda Bureau became known to the general public. Several of the men who attending the meeting <strong>agreed to write pamphlets and books that would promote the government&#39;s view of the situation.</strong></p>

<p>In 1914 Conan Doyle wrote the recruiting pamphlet, To Arms!. The WPB arranged for Conan Doyle to go the Western Front and his pamphlet, A Visit to the Three Fronts was published in 1916. During the war Doyle also wrote his six volume history, The British Campaign in France and Flanders. Conan Doyle also wrote on the First World War for the Daily Chronicle.</p>

<p>Pinker was talking about his grandfather who owned a garment factory where they made neckties. One day Pinker&#39;s father went to visit him and was told he was in a backroom. There Pinker&#39;s father saw the grandfather working on fabric with a sewing machine. He asked him what he was doing. He was working on the cut-out remnants of fabric and &quot;if I sew them a certain way I can get a few exta ties out of the lot.&quot; Ok, said his father, but why are you doing this rather than one of your workers. The grandfather looked at him, poked a finger to his head, and said &quot;Goyishe Kopf&quot; - Gentile brains!</p>

<p>The story gives a flavor of the kind of audience Pinker was addressing - it&#39;s telling that several of the older audience members around me laughed at the &quot;Goyishe Kopf&quot; - they didn&#39;t need to wait for the translation. </p>
