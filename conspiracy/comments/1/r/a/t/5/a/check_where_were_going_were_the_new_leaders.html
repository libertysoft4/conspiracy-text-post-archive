We can no longer stand idly by and watch as our communications are modified, deleted, monitored, or trolled. We need to take this to other websites. </p>

<p>Most of all, we need to consider what we as individuals in the real world actually want. What do we need to do to grow into people who can support those who will come to us scared and confused? <em>We</em> are the ones who have been shoulder deep in this for years, decades, even. We can no longer waste time on unnecessary bullshit, which doesn&#39;t help us progress. </p>

<p>Who knows of any good sites that would make a good back up? Remember: our subreddit has already been banned. We&#39;ve attracted attention and we know what they think of us. It will come to a point that it will affect our real lives. There is no going back. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time, ladies and gentlemen. You all can no longer ignore these posts asking the <em>hard</em> questions. What do you do when people begin to monitor you? What do you do when people come to you in real life, asking what to do, or what to become informed on? What do you do when you realize this is about your <em>life</em> and our life on this planet as a species?</p>

<p>Please, please respond. This is serious now. </p>

<p>EDIT: So of course the most discussion I&#39;ve had is with some guy who believes the manipulated organized religions have all the answers. Come on, r/conspiracy. Where&#39;s the diversity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank god. I think we should begin to build networks within all the most common mediums on the internet as well as in real life. </p>

<p>Facebook, youtube, google? We should not be afraid to use these. We should commandeer these. I understand that the major ISPs own the resources which allows the internet to be possible but we need to figure out some way to utilize these. We may have to go back to broadcasting via radiowaves, as well. People still listen to the radio quite a bit. </p>

<p>Secondly: we <em>cannot</em> be afraid to discuss these things in our everyday lives. People <em>know</em> this is happening but feel they will be ostracized -- we need to make sure people know that none of this is a <em>secret</em>. It is not a secret that we&#39;re being fucked over by our governments (globally). It is not a secret that we&#39;ve destroyed the ecosystem we need to survive. </p>

<p>It is not a secret that we are at the crossroads in our evolution where we can <em>decide</em> whether to survive and thrive or to watch ourselves end.</p>

<p>In real life: we need to really begin considering forming communities and groups dedicated to analyzing and disseminating this information however we can. We need to dedicate ourselves to the idea that this isn&#39;t just some abstract intellectual fight but is a fight for our minds, future, and progeny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Honesty is the best policy. Honesty is what we&#39;re demanding from our world, so it should be the standard at which we approach. If we&#39;re going to be honest about things like free energy and near-term extinction then we need to be honest about what it means to really accept these as part of our reality.</p>

<p>If TPTB will not supply us with the expertise and resources, what are we going to do to replicate it and save ourselves? Who can we depend upon? What does it mean for us as a species to face the fact that we are not alone? We certainly cannot be content with our mediocre form of humanity. We cannot continue to operate like this. What does all this mean on an <em>individual</em> level? </p>

<p>We all need to be leaders whom can help create other leaders. For the future of our species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s clear that I see the problem. I think it&#39;s clear many many people also see the problem. The problem isn&#39;t the problem, the problem is doing something about it. Which is what I&#39;ve said every time I&#39;ve come to r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>I think r/conspiracy forgets that the everyman does know things are wrong. We all forget that if we want to see the change we have to be the change. But we also need support networks and standards. We need a context to work from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This short comment shows how noncommittal you are. To not expand upon what that means for you or what it will mean for others means either you&#39;re short-sighted or self-centered. Either way, you need to think about what sort of role you play in this larger drama. One person can do a whole lot more than this world would have you believe.</p>

<p>You say that, but knowing that there is a kill switch would make the cloning of such a site irrelevant. What we would need at that point is some way to connect <em>quickly</em> and to be as efficient as possible in our steps towards freedom as a species. </p>

<p>Understand: you play a part. How you choose to live your life, how you choose to look at it, and how you interact with it all matter. If you feel like it is ultimately useless to connect with people in a meaningful matter, you will have lost sight of what this is all about. This is about the connection, integration, and evolution of the human species. Your singular connection with others, integration of self/shadow, and progress intellectually/physically is a link in that chain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are looking at what?</p>

<p>fiction. everything out here in cyberland that is not educating you on how to feed your family and community. the internet sells you kindle books that will be useless if they take down the electrical grid. so an internet kill switch is irrelevant, just a catch phrase for them cutting off the head of their opposition.</p>

<p>everyone will be throwing their hands up wishing they had electricity to warm their houses and will not know how to bring any information to their friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>my community is as secure as any I believe. and if you have not already made arrangements to secure your community, and your food supply then no amount of prepping will keep you safe.</p>

<p>I could post many things on how to communicate when this place is gone, but they would all be summed up in a simple statement, the real world doesn&#39;t have a screen, a keyboard, or a mouse.</p>

<p>you will have to deal with the possibility of not having this place or any like it, as long as someone else provides it. you live in a world of benefits and privileges, how do I tell you that you could have a life of rights and responsibilities instead? can you understand the difference?</p>

<p>just the idea that you look outside yourself and outside of your community to a place like this, testifies that fiction rules over vision. </p>

<p>go find the survivalist community in your area and listen to them, help them to prepare themselves and yourself for the time that this place is not here.</p>

<p>is that better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are short-sighted in your righteousness. You think that hiding away in the &quot;white-flight&quot; fantasy will work but that concept is the height of privilege. Do you honestly think that small communities of humans will be able to survive disasters which are global without the help of those with relevant experience? Do you think all those among you contain the necessary experience to survive everything from radioactivity to spiritual crises? </p>

<p>Your sort of mind state is very limiting to a species of people which needs all the opportunities it can hold onto. You are not even considering the amount of people who are willing to die for what they believe and care for. You are fear minded, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Such hubris only leaves one dead. It also leaves the species with individuals who would&#39;ve been better off having evolved in a more diversified group. </p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking of surviving cataclysm and human stupidity is not wrong, so much as it is dehumanizing. There will be plenty of people looking well beyond such scenarios and already prepared to be those who will help everyone lead themselves into the future. </p>

<p>Like I said: I don&#39;t think you - and many like you - have as much faith as you say. You&#39;re prepared for inevitable disaster <em>but not what it means to be creating physical, mental, and spiritual ultimacy.</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have been building the lives of the friends and family that I am surrounded with sense the mid 80&#39;s, I have had people calling me a wack job sense I was in my mid 20&#39;s. so I have told enough people in the last 30+ years what needs to be done and where to go to do it.</p>

<p>if you think that someone outside of your community is the answer, you will lead others straight to the FEMA camps.</p>

<p>the centralization of anything leaves you set up to be controlled or worse yet destroyed. that is the excuse that is killing our economy. you are absolutely wrong in your assumptions and illiterate of the spiritual warfare that is being presented to you.</p>

<p>if I told you the truth you would just argue with me, you would have your points to keep a debate going but you would never accept that anyone might know what to do to see that the most important thing that you have is passed on to future generations, your DNA.</p>

<p>so some questions to see if you even understand what the hell you are saying:</p>

<p>why do you need to connect quickly to anyone that cannot place their hands on your problems to help you fix your problems?</p>

<p>have you put yourself in a position of food safety, meaning you have a way to get food year around for you and your family?</p>

<p>have you made sure that you can keep warm in the winter without electricity?</p>

<p>Have you built around yourself people that are willing and able to help you when you need it?</p>

<p>if someone came to rob you would you need 911 or could you handle it with what you have at hand?</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but I have one simple piece of advice, shut the fuck up and do some research you lazy piece of shit, people are willing to teach you but what in the hell would it ever do to help them in the coming storm if all you do is insult them and tell them how inferior they are to your intellectual laziness. libraries have been written and are free and online so go read them and quit trying to get everyone to give you what you want. go find it like I and many others have, then you need to work so that people will trust you enough to want to befriend you for the rest of their lives, that given your skills of making new friends and influencing people, will be your biggest hurtle.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>P.S. I actually DID confront all of your sudo-intillectual points, I am not sure you have the intellect to know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR For the record: I do not think you&#39;re wrong. I think we&#39;re focusing on different things. I have no doubt that humans will survive. But will it be how you think it is? Think of what you want to happen.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re being threatened by me without realizing we&#39;re talking about the same thing. I&#39;m just talking about the flip-side of your issue. It is not only about survival, it is not only about kill or be killed. I have made peace and have prepared for what is coming.</p>

<p>What I am talking about is beyond that. To not make the same mistakes. Perhaps you thought I was thinking of some utopia without any of the issues of diversity or some such. But I know that with this change comes a new beginning and with a new beginning comes new challenges.</p>

<p>I know that the next step we all take determines where humans go from here on out. For sure, the elites, TPTB or what-have-you have devised a way to survive regardless of what happens. We need a way to connect not just in our every day lives but across a vast network. That is how we will insure that what <em>really</em> counts survives.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think our disagreements begin about where we think it&#39;s going. I do not believe in the same apocalypse you do. And I think I believe we can do more than you think. But please, do continue to dismiss my humanity as inferior to your rationale.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve had to make peace many times with the idea of killing another person or beings. I do not take the idea of warfare or the end of humanity and life as we know it lightly. I have people that I love and care about like any other. I know what ways I need to be prepared; these are choices everyone has to make. On the internet, I understand, sometimes people forget that. But I do not care only about the people within arms reach. There may be some extremely special people out there I need to come in contact with. Everyone is important. This is how I relate to the world.</p>

<p>I think that there is definitely a &#39;spiritual&#39; war going on on this planet. I really have no doubt of this. The sooner people put this into context with the greed and corruption experienced, I believe the sooner people will realize what they have to do: change. Not just change, but to evolve, and quickly. And not only for themselves or those they love, but for the whole. The sooner we realize that we, as a species, are a part of the universe, the sooner we can begin acting like it and grow out of our adolescence. </p>

<p>Please tell me you understand what that means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here comes the argument that you will not accept as truth but in fact is the truth.</p>

<p>there are only two philosophies or schools of thought: </p>

<p>one is based on the Torah and works from all men being created equal. </p>

<p>the other is based upon the Talmud which is laws of men that work under the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>they are not compatible with each other.</p>

<p>but right now one must understand both of them to understand what is happening in the world.</p>

<p>everything goes back to a man crucified and that paid the debt of sin for once and for all. </p>

<p>the abomination of nations is the fiction of the man that is called &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. and we are not in the end times of revelations until the lost ten tribes of Israel are called back to the land that YHVH promised them.</p>

<p>so you are right, we do not see the same future, and I doubt that I can help do anything for you but to interrupt your boredom. use your time to learn and pray that your god guide you where you need to do it at.</p>

<p>but I will help you on your trek to truth with one word, the name of a thing that if you find out it&#39;s mysteries, you will have went a long way to understand what is happening and what to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They why do only some kids get a pencil and piece of paper while others have a stick? Not trying to get into a religious argument. It just bugs me when people try to use their religion, something that parts of the world have ZERO concept of, as reasoning for world events. For a test to be valid, it has to be fair. What is fair about a family of generational Christians getting into heaven while little Umbktu, who grew up in a random tribe in Africa, has to go to hell? </p>

<p>This is off topic so I wont mind if you don&#39;t respond. A nerve was just rubbed. Sorry for putting if off on you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>everything goes back to a man crucified and that paid the debt of sin for once and for all.</p>

<p>the abomination of nations is the fiction of the man that is called &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. and we are not in the end times of revelations until the lost ten tribes of Israel are called back to the land that YHVH promised them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do believe in the Hebrew Messiah, his name is pronounced Yahushua ha Mashiach.</p>

<p>so, although your initial assumption was incorrect, it was only so by precision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about this too. I think part of the point is is that those with power, those who have manipulated mankind, care about these belief systems being in place. But that is exactly why I observe and do not believe in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How foolish.  An unbelievable lie that has been used for far too long to allow those controlled to not fight back.  To not stand up.  You are going to look mighty foolish when your one and only life is snuffed while you so willingly allow it.  With the hope that you will have a second fantasy life.  This is all there is.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I wasn&#39;t expecting you to run and talk about religion. Belief is a tool, sir. How are you using this tool to shape the world you want to create? And are these beliefs the one you want to use?</p>

<p>Why are you - and so many others - so convinced that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about? Or that I have some sort of personal problem watching the world end? It&#39;s something that&#39;s happening in real time and all people can do (in the majority) is fall back on antiquated beliefs or be douchebags about it, like you.</p>

<p>For the record: survival of the fittest and all being equal is a false dichotomy created by the paradigm you&#39;re currently operating under. &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; is a misnomer -- it&#39;s actually about whom can adapt the best. Everyone can be equal in such a system through the concept of evolution: everyone counts when everyone molds one another&#39;s reality. That is a massive responsibility (creating reality) which many people shirk off by turning to messiahs and limiting beliefs -- not accepting your part of this is what will take away your opportunity to change yourself and the world in a completely open way, without others controlling you.</p>

<p>If you believe what you do, then no, we have nothing in common. I am not under the thumb of those gods or their beliefs.</p>

<p>now you see there is where you fail your basic primal function. rather than learn from someone, you choose to alienate them. you serve no useful purpose to the future as you cannot build community like that, and community is the only vessel that can carry your DNA into the future.</p>

<p>here comes the argument that you will not accept as truth but in fact is the truth.</p>

<p>there are some things that you can never know, but if you research that one word you might begin to understand.</p>

<p>just type it into Google and see how deep the rabbit hole goes. every law you live by, whether you like it or not, comes out of that research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you even talking about. You are the one &quot;arguing&quot; with me. We came to the conclusion we&#39;re talking about the same thing but you devolved into talking about how you believed in the Torah and Bible as the answers. I think those belief systems were created both as a way to tell people what&#39;s going on, as well as a limiter to our true selves.</p>

<p>I do not believe those things are the only ones with answers. Some people do and others don&#39;t. That&#39;s how it goes. I was merely asking you if that is what you wanted to believe in to get to where we&#39;re going. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll look it up. But I think you may just be contrary. This conversation isn&#39;t really going anywhere.</p>
