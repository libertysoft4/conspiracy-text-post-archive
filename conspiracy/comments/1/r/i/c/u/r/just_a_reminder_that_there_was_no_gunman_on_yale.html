<p>Let&#39;s pretend that they immediately knew the call originated from a phone booth (they didn&#39;t).  In your eyes, the &quot;logical&quot; thing to do would be to ignore the threat solely because it came from a phone booth?  That&#39;s idiotic.  YOU are the one letting your emotion get in the way of logic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So because someone was seen with a gun the call said, it&#39;s time for the SWAT to arrive?  Carrying a gun is legal almost everywhere in the state, but I&#39;m sure the school has rules against it, in which case they can look into it.  This sounds similar to pre-emptive war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sort of &quot;probable cause&quot; is so troubling...</p>

<p>If such a call would need to be actually documented in order to incite this sort of police action, all one would need to do is place a call. If no log is actually needed to act, then you don&#39;t even have to send the junior lieutenant down to the corner to place the call, you could just say you got one.</p>

<p>I wonder if there will be more and more anonymous tips from phone booths and burner cell phones to the point that one needs an id to place a call at all, or have a cell phone that is connected to their identity.</p>
