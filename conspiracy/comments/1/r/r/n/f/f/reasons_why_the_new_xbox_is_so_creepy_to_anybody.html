<p>I don&#39;t understand how people are so dense</p>

<p>It&#39;s not going to stop with the kinect.</p>

<p>Verizon got a lot of shit last year for introducing a DVR with similar creepy features - talking about targeting contraceptive ads to people it detects romancing, etc...

<p>Yeah a lot of kids are going to get it and have zero problems. They&#39;ll grow up loving the technology and have no problems being laser/IR scanned at every waking moment. No problem with that at all. We can trust companies that make electronics, no matter how invasive the tech is or how many times they get caught lying/aiding spy/law enforcement organizations</p>

<p>might as well copy/past this here too...</p>

<p>The kinect, and other viewer-monitoring devices, are going to change advertising and programming/content to levels you couldn&#39;t believe.</p>

<p>The IR will know which parts of commercials send the most blood to our cocks, or which tv-show arguments/news programs get us mad, what makes us happy, what we&#39;ll sit through, etc...</p>

<p>I personally think tv, and everything else &quot;entertainment&quot; now, is derogatory and pandering enough as it is. If they&#39;re going to be openly collecting this kind of data - and openly trying to monetize every aspect of it - and not so openly using it for scarier purposes...  </p>

<p>TV and movies are going to be TERRIBLE in ten years, not to mention how far the police state will advance by then...</p>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t be about gamers avoiding one company&#39;s product, it should be a society rejecting an <em>incredibly</em> invasive technology being foisted into our everyday lives</p>

<blockquote>
<p>copy/paste, mostly from before PRISM was publicized</p>
</blockquote>

<p>look up &quot;Stellar Wind&quot; and &quot;Trapwire&quot; if you don&#39;t know what they are.</p>

<p>this is far from the extent of it...</p>

<p>&quot;This may sound preposterous but it is neither a joke nor an exaggeration,&quot; Capuano wrote. &quot;These DVRs would essentially observe consumers as they watch television as a way to super-target ads. It is an incredible invasion of privacy. Given what we have recently learned about the access that the government has to the phone numbers we call, the emails we send and the websites we visit, it is important for consumers to decide for themselves whether they want this technology. Think about what you do in the privacy of your own home and then think about how you would feel sharing that information with your cable company, their advertisers and your government.&quot; </p>

<p>Currently, even emulating a PS2 game is somewhat dodgy, and requires very, very powerful hardware. So, the option of emulating a PS4 or XB1 game on a console running SteamOS is quite far down the line.</p>

With the 360, Microsoft had the benefit of the original uncompiled source code for DirectX, Win32, and any other API&#39;s required by the original Xbox, it was trivial for them to make changes to that code compared to the homebrew scene starting with practically nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it was extensively audited before inclusion in mainline Linux.</p>

<p>the NSA&#39;s rationale for creating seLinux (security enhanced linux) was two fold.  The first being that the NSA uses Linux internally, and adding functionality to it to bring it up to their internal specifications for secure systems is a win for them. Second, because Linux is open source and freely modifiable by anyone (although inclusion in mainline only happens after review), it provides a mechanism by which you can push closed source software around. one of the NSA&#39;s mission objectives, although not very notable in it&#39;s history, is taking steps to try to increase the electronic security of US interests and the economy. by implementing proper security in an open source os, you pressure others to do the same, lest they lose more market share.  same tactic that Google used when they developed the V8 JavaScript engine, and the chrome browser. Google wins when the web works better, which happens when browsers are less shitty. they don&#39;t care if chrome has market dominance, since its mere existence has spurred Firefox and IE to step up their game.  win or lose, Google wins.  </p>

<p>the release of seLinux, amongst other factors, has spurred Microsoft to harden the windows security model. widespread adoption or not, the average computer has become less susceptible to general attacks. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t download the update that changes WGA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure Windows can just change that setting on it&#39;s own now (especially in Win8), I know I&#39;ve seen it reverse itself if using Microsoft Security Essentials on Win 7 before, Win 8&#39;s Defender likely does the same.  MSE has administrative rights and uses WinUpdate to patch itself and acquire virus definitions and whatnot I think, so unless you&#39;ve handicapped it there (and thus lowered it&#39;s effectiveness), it&#39;ll just do what it wants unless WinUpdate is totally disabled.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re running pirated Windows, you&#39;re better off just letting it run unimpeded and periodically re-activating it with updated activators as necessary. That&#39;s what I do now, my Win8.1 is fully &quot;activated&quot; with updates enabled and all features unlocked, if and when that prompt re-appears, I&#39;ll just make it go away again, it only takes a minute. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly how I looked at it. As soon as the info on the One was released and the backlash ensued, I was immediate in my decision that I&#39;d be going back to the PS network. I was a PS gamer before I got a 360 as a gift anyways, so I&#39;ve never been the type to be ultimately one system over the other.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, all of this shit has happened within a matter of 10 years, basically. I graduated high school in 2002, and back then, I think maybe two of my friends had personal cell phones. Most of us were relying on AOL instant messenger and our house phones to stay in contact. Now, everyone feels like they need to have a cell phone. In my opinion, there is absolutely NO REASON why anyone under the age of AT LEAST 16 should have a cell phone. Why does a 10 year old need a smart phone? Hell, why do they need a smart phone, a tablet, a Nook, an XBox, and a laptop? I&#39;m all for technology, but this constant idea of &quot;We always need to stay connected!&quot; is part of what has ruined our society and our social activity.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;m just a little old school in my thinking because my class/age group was basically the last generation to not have constant contact via cell phones. The more we constantly feel we always have to be connected, sharing, photoing, uploading, screen shotting, Snapchatting, etc... the worse I can only imagine things are going to get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is sad is, as I am a 15 year old in high school, all of my peers openly mock me because I refuse to use my phone for anything except emergencies. I have no use for the thing, and I only have one because of my parents. </p>

<p>Any time I try to convince people that the &quot;always connected&quot; philosophy that they have is dangerous, they write me off as paranoid and a lunatic. I feel that a cellphone can be a useful device, but it must be used in moderation, not like how these people use them. Every waking moment is spent on the dang things. No one else knows how to have a nice conversation face to face anymore.</p>

<p>Seriously, I doubt anyone could have dreamed that all of this spying could happen...let alone WOULD happen!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with being antisocial. I never said we were becoming antisocial to begin with.</p>

<p>Technology has changed our every day life and how we socially interact. It hasn&#39;t made us recluses, but it has made is lazy, shy, uncomfortable, and rude in ways that we never were before every person on the street had to walk around staring at a phone screen all day.</p>

<p>Assholes get in line at restaurants and stand there and talk on their phone, holding up lines and being rude to the people that work there. If you&#39;re going to go place an order, get off your fucking phone and place an order. You can talk about how drunk you got and how you shit your pants at that party later. In line at a restaurant/gas station/grocery store/ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE line is not the place for you to be rude to others simply doing their job because you think it&#39;s an inconvenience that they&#39;re talking to you while you&#39;re on the phone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any statistics to back this up, but I can only assume that the trading of nude pictures to people that shouldn&#39;t be seeing them has risen ten fold since the personal cell phone boom. And as many people have said, you see kids as young as four, five, or six knowing how to use these things extensively. I&#39;m sure this is going to continue to turn out wonderfully for our society.</p>

<p>Simply put - Technology is great, but too much of it ruins the basic human social interaction. When I was growing up, I couldn&#39;t wait to get outside and play sports, hide and seek, go fishing, whatever... just be outside! Now you drive past playgrounds and kids sit on swings and benches playing games on tablets, phones, e-readers, laptops, whatever... I just think it&#39;s sad. It&#39;s not antisocial in the least, but it&#39;s completely changed human life as a whole. If you can&#39;t see that, I feel sorry for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nope. theres actually an option in the settings to turn it off a long with the voice commands and the low power state where you can wake it up just by saying &quot;xbox on&quot;</p>

<p>ill admit at first it did sound like it would watch / hear you all the time but all that can be turned off in the settings as i found out first hand....and if you really want to go the extra step they even sell privacy covers for the kinect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories aside... I probably won&#39;t get the Xbox One despite being a 360 owner.  I don&#39;t <em>want</em> stupid stuff like Kinect and it&#39;s worlds more expensive because it&#39;s crammed full of features I don&#39;t particularly want or need.  It&#39;s also shaping up to be full of cookie cutter games and the same old franchises (Gears, Halo etc.)</p>

<p>The PS4 is cheaper and seems to be the more powerful system.  It&#39;s a good time to switch seeing as the XBOne isn&#39;t backwards compatible with anything related to my 360.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would I say? I&#39;d say you speak like a goddamn meme that was played out 3 years ago. I&#39;d like to preface my response by saying that I in no way responded with hostility. You did. I&#39;d be more than happy to have a civil discussion, but apparently that&#39;s just a little too much to ask for someone with your level of emotional intelligence and maturity. Though I won&#39;t dumb this down. Try to keep up, sport.</p>

<p>Well, to start, you&#39;re obviously a sad, confused, little man. Biometrics is not the same as fingerprints. The iPhone doesn&#39;t collect biometric data because it cannot. It collects fingerprint data because you ask it to. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how fingerprints could be used to advertise to you. Biometrics, on the other hand, is pretty obvious. I&#39;m worried about fingerprints because they&#39;re nearly indisputable. If a prosecution uses them to positively identify me for a crime I didn&#39;t commit, I can&#39;t possibly defend myself. Even if the prints were planted. Or weren&#39;t ever there at all. The burden of proof is always on the prosecution, because it&#39;s so hard to prove you didn&#39;t do something, compared to proving that you did. I didn&#39;t drive a corvette yesterday. Well, how can I possibly prove that? </p>

<p>DNA information is largely useless in this context. And pointing out who may or may not have it doesn&#39;t prove any sort of point. </p>

<p>You could identify things like hair color or ethnicity, but that&#39;s about as useful as looking out your window to identify demographics. Obviously, this can be tied back into false identification. Only a handful of states even collect DNA information at birth, and even so, it has only been practiced for a few years. Anyone with sentient thought enough to use a computer is too old for that kind of widespread genetic reaping. </p>

<p>Sure, in some states, newborns are fingerprinted. Again, this is relatively new and relatively uncommon. If they fingerprinted every person born, the database would be too large to reasonably use as a basis for identifying someone any number of years later. Especially considering the stretching and growing that takes place after a human is born. But you knew that people grow, didn&#39;t you, sport?</p>

<p>But, please, tell me how &#39;the hospital&#39; has collected biometric information on me, having been to one once since the day I was born. Please, explain that to me, sport. </p>

<p>Although judging by a cursory browse through your comment history, I&#39;d expect all of this to go right over the head of a stoner snow-rat. A real walking stereotype. Good luck with that, sport. </p>

<p>Side note - you really think that the database of fingerprints would be too ungainly to be used if we fingerprinted everyone? That is an absurd argument. You realize that the government acknowledged that they keep the entire internet for 3 days time to search through at any given moment.

<p>I offended you this much by using the word &#39;sport?&#39; Really? You were much more insulting to me than I ever was to you. I was perfectly civil. You were extraordinarily, above and beyond hostile. You combed through my history to find more reasons to hate on me. Stop for a minute and think about how pathetic that makes you look. I&#39;m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume there is something else going on in your life rather than judge you by this experience. Good luck.</p>

<p>I got nothing better to do than find a reason to hate you. Gonna push someone, expect to get pushed back. For the record, I looked at about 2 pages and knew you were someone attacking. Fuck druggies forever. Scum of the fucking earth. Got no sympathy for you hippy fucks who OD- just keep yourself out the way of the rest of society. Try not to take anyone else out with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I played Xbox One at a friend&#39;s house yesterday for the first time.</p>

<p>We were messing around with one of the Kinect&#39;s launch titles. First off, after &quot;seeing&quot; my face once, from a distance, in the dark basement, it began to log me in to the system every time I walked back into the room. </p>

<p>When determining who the two players in the Kinect Sports game were, the system displayed a graphic of a wedge-shaped &quot;net&quot; that represented its readable area. To not be included in the game, the third person had to step off this net and watch their icon slowly turn red, flash, and disappear. <em>We were literally hiding behind a wall so that the Xbox wouldn&#39;t see us and track our movements precisely</em>. </p>

<p>It was goddamn horrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to somebody&#39;s house because they own an xbone is a bit extreme, don&#39;t you think? Owning one is the scariest aspect, as you log a lot of personal information into the machine through the use of social networking, purchases, etc. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t own one, then regardless if it sees you or not at your friend&#39;s house, it wouldn&#39;t be able to detect exactly who you are or pull any personal information about you. The ads that it would market would be towards your friend, not you. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing about all this, feel free to correct, but from what I&#39;m seeing, it doesn&#39;t infiltrate the privacy of a guest, unless you consider the xbone recognizing a human and not being able to get anymore information other than that an infiltration of privacy. </p>

But with all that being said (and excuse me if this is in the article, can&#39;t read it at the moment), can it take all that information it gathers from you, and apply it to a name?

Does the xbone have the ability to recognize a face from one xbone to another, even if I don&#39;t have a profile? Is it able to eventually find out who I am (first and last name), and link the information gathered from the xbone to a bigger database?</p>

The machine knows exactly what your face looks like, your exact height, eye color, hair color, skin tone, and it absolutely knows your name because it&#39;s recording the conversations.  Microsoft will assign you a number for their database and every time you enter any home or BUSINESS that has a kinect it will know that you specifically are there.</p>

<p>Microsoft might not know exactly who you are as in what your federal social security number is but the NSA most certainly will because microsoft feeds it all to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one of my other points posted here.
There are greater (and older) ways of monitoring and tracking people.
Including the use of the internet.</p>

<p>People worrying about what information is going to be captured, yet they&#39;re happy to get a passport, driving license, use the internet, use their phone, go out in public etc etc.</p>

<p>You can unplug the kinect device, you cant unplug all of the CCTV cameras outside.</p>

<p>The most dangerous thing is that people never think it will happen to them and it will never come from within. Unfortunately, Osama bin Laden has been winning this &quot;war&quot; we are in since 9/12/2001, we just haven&#39;t realized it. It&#39;s rather reminiscent of the decline of the Roman empire, not that I am a fan of the Roman empire, but there&#39;s something rather poetic in the fact that what seems to be our self-inflicted decline and loss of focus and principle has rather stark similarities with the slow drain that was the decline of the Roman Empire and Republic. Hubris, it&#39;s a bitch.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  To be fair, like the article implied, Microsoft claimed for over two years that the kinect was to be an always-on technology.   They only did a 180 of that little more than a couple months ago.  Further, while disabled through settings, the kinect is still on and IR blasting.  It seems that the kinect must still always be attached and powered, or am I interpreting this incorrectly? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Playstation did it with linux. Microsoft has already shown its hand for the direction it wants to take the xbox. Before they backtracked, they claimed you couldn&#39;t disconnect the Kinect due to the architecture of XBOX One. I really don&#39;t think it is that far of a leap to think a simple mandatory software update will make it impossible to play online without having it plugged in. Despite the outcry of the fan base, Sony faced no repercussions for wiping people&#39;s linux partition even though it was an advertised feature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the whole thing. Two things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The reason why kids will accept Kinect or other things without question is because smartphones and game consoles are, to some people, indispensable. They provide the user with something that they refuse to part with. That&#39;s why South Park had an episode of the itunes T&amp;C update making people the property of Apple (or something, I forget the details of the episode). Especially when the consequences are fuzzy and after the fact, the mind sees the costs as already assumed.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are worried that a written work, especially one with numerous additional sites, is too long, then it probably is. I appreciate the work you did to put this together, but what always sits at the front of 50-page research papers is a summary of findings. A paragraph TL;DR that entices the reader to get into the depths, but still allows them to come away with the gist of what you&#39;ve found. </p></li>

My current and previous employers just assumed everyone was on Facebook and used it for work...  When a company as big as MS makes a move like this, you can count on it having larger ramifications. ...I just read about someone who convinced their boss to buy two Xbox ones to skype, just another example.</p>

Now, I&#39;ve explained how I know they want to doit, and how I think they&#39;ll keep trying to get what they want. Why do you think they will give up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it.</p>

<p>MS TRIED to do it. They really did. </p>

<p>The MS execs responsible developed a plan to fundamentally change console game ownership, focus tested it, talked to people they know, and pondered what the reaction of the gaming world would be.</p>

<p>Their whole company would have been discussing it among themselves. I know If I worked there, and knew, I would have been alarmed that they were really going to go through with it. </p>

<p>If they truly believed gamers weren&#39;t going to be as super pissed as they ended up being, they were blind.</p>

<p>If they knew it was going to blow up, and still decided to go through with it, OR were tied into contracts they couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t get out of by the time they realized it was going to be a huge mess, then they were irresponsible and arrogant.</p>

<p>Either way, the whole episode doesn&#39;t give me much faith in them to NOT, try it again in 2 years.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Guess what Gamers, digital games are now $5 cheaper than retail games. Look how much of a better deal they are. oh! Remember that family circle game sharing feature we were going to give you, until you ruined it by complaining? It&#39;s back too!&quot;</em></p>

<p>6 months later.</p>

<p>MS announces used games are off the table, digital only, install discs only, game sharing.</p>

<p>Millions of people don&#39;t suddenly try to sell their Xboxes and hundreds of dollars worth of disc games (nothing changed about old games) and buy a ps4. They stick with xbox for the rest of the generation. </p>

<p>Microsoft profits</p>

<p>That will cut out the middle man (EB, GameStop, etc.) so that MS will get a bigger slice of the game-sale pie. No cut for the middle man on new games since it&#39;s all digital, no used games so more digital games sold.</p>

<p>That&#39;s more money for them.</p>

<p>It recognizes who is in your living room by their image, walk and voice, potentially recording all that information.

<p>Why and for what purpose is all this surveillance necessary? What is the justification? Is it JUST for increasing advertising efficiency and squeezing more $$$ out of a population, or, is it for something (which you seem to hint at) more nefarious, like &#39;theyre getting ready to kill us off&#39; or &#39;prevent a massive uprising&#39;?</p>

<p>The conspiracy part of my brain wonders if there are types of humans that are desirable and types of humans that arent, and these new systems will mainly benefit those that are. A dumbed down, pandered to, laborer2.0 that is ok with being a rat in a cage. Actually more like an ant.</p>

<p>TL;DR; whats the point of all this, is it really &#39;bad&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s there because these are companies want to make more money off you. </p>

<p>The companies want to make more money off of you because they are required by law to put profits for the shareholders first, before any greater societal considerations.</p>

<p>This sounds like a cliche, but it really is a result of the advertising industry which grew up in the first half the 20th century. Since then companies have done everything they can to persuade people to give them more money. They largely do this with really base appeals to emotions that aren&#39;t very effective.</p>

<p>In recent years the idea of creating personalized advertising that&#39;s particularly persuasive has been championed tech companies that are built on data and data analysis. To date, these tech giants haven&#39;t been too good at providing useful information to advertisers, so attempts to collect more data increased. This is where we stand today.</p>

<p>Xbox One offers MS a major new source of data to mine. They hope they can use this to understand customers better, and also just to sell the data upstream. The technology itself is not created to monitor you, that&#39;s just a benefit MS gets based on having a camera and mic on all the time (at least potentially). </p>

<p>The bad part is that you may legally be giving up just about all privacy expectation you have in your home. You&#39;re allowing a third party to monitor just about everything you do, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have gov&#39;t lawyers maintain they don&#39;t need a warrant given this &quot;choice&quot; you&#39;ve made. And then there&#39;s all the NSA stuff that&#39;s come out--it would hardly be surprising if the NSA collected realtime audio and video from every single one of these and kept it forever--I&#39;d be shocked if they aren&#39;t trying to do it. That might be considered &quot;bad.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agreed its a disturbing trend, just the fact that you can make it turn on by saying &quot;Xbox On&quot; says it all: if it can recieve that voice command, that means it can potentially record anything and everything you say, and due to the PRISM act Microsoft makes all of its collected data available to the government.</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t exactly know how the government benefits from spying on dorito eating, mountain dew drinking Xbox players, but its disturbing nonetheless that many households could essentially have a wiretap in them and a camera via the kinect.</p>

The ps4 and the Xbox One seem to be a rehashing of the last Gen consoles just with better graphics. Neither system really has anything that makes me say wow, I have to have that. Plus, most of the big titles are coming to pc anyway. I owned both last Gen consoles but I really think I&#39;m going to skip the new gen...

<blockquote>
<p>April 26th 2006</p>

<p>Oh Barry Fox, does a week ever go by when you don&#39;t find a great patent or two? Today the intrepid Mr. Fox manages to dig up an application by consumer-darling Apple for an LCD display embedded with thousands of microscopic image sensors that would allow users to video-conference while looking straight into the &quot;camera.&quot; Data accumulated by the individual sensors would be stitched into actual images using special software, which will probably be bundled into future versions of iLife. Since the patent specifies almost as many sensors per screen as there are pixels, some of those sensors could have different focal lengths, with a defacto zoom lens created by switching between them. Apple goes on to suggest portable uses for the technology, such as employing the displays in cellphones and PDAs, so you can add another item to the list of features we&#39;ll be expecting from the iPhone and Newton 2.0 when they finally hit stores.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>26 April 2006</p>

<p>We could soon see a new kind of display screen from computer maker Apple - one that simultaneously takes pictures while showing images.</p>

<p>The clever idea is to insert thousands of microscopic image sensors in-between the liquid crystal display cells in the screen. Each sensor captures its own small image, but software stitches these together to create a single, larger picture.</p>

<p>A large LCD screen filled with image sensors would be ideal for videoconferencing, Apple suggests, as participants would always appear to look straight into the &quot;camera&quot;. The technique could also add a camera function to a cellphone or PDA without wasting space, and light from the screen should help illuminate a subject.</p>

<p>The more sensors there are, the wider and clearer the image. Sketches accompanying the company&#39;s patent show as many sensors as liquid crystal cells in a screen. If some of the sensors have different focal lengths, switching between them would make the screen behave like a zoom lens. </p>

<p>...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A device comprising: a display area; an array of display elements located within the display area, each display element capable of displaying a pixel of information, either alone or in combination with other display elements; and an array of image elements located within the display area, each image element being capable of capturing visual information from a source in front of the display area; wherein each image element has a lens that does not interfere with any display elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 1, wherein the image elements are located in a housing that isolates the image elements from the display elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 2, wherein each image element is in its own housing.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 3, wherein a row of image elements share a housing.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 4, wherein the array of display elements is a formed in a deep encased cell structure.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 1, wherein the array of display elements is a formed in a deep encased cell structure.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 1, wherein the array of image elements is a formed in a plurality of deep wells or channels.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 1 further comprising an image assembler that modifies the data that is received by the array of image elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 1, wherein the image elements are dispersed within the display area such that they do not block any display elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 1, wherein the image elements are dispersed within the display area in such a way that they prevent some pixels of information from being displayed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>11. The device of claim 1, wherein the device is used in a portable communication device.</strong></p>

<p><strong>12. The device of claim 11, wherein the portable communication device is a telephone.</strong></p>

<ol>

</ol>

<p><strong>14. The device of claim 1, wherein the device is used in a computer monitor or a television.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>A device comprising: an illumination area that includes at least one light source that emits light; and an array of image elements dispersed throughout the illumination area, each image element being capable of capturing visual information from a source in front of the illumination area; wherein the image elements are dispersed such that space in-between at least some image elements is able to emit light from the at least one light source of the illumination area.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 15, wherein the device is a medical device.</p></li>
<li><p>A device comprising: a display area; an array of display elements located within the display area, each display element capable of displaying a pixel of information, either alone or in combination with other display elements; and an array of image elements located within the display area, each image element being capable of capturing visual information from a source in front of the display area.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 17, wherein the image elements are located in a housing that isolates the image elements from the display elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 18, wherein each image element is in its own housing.</p></li>
<li><p>The device of claim 18, wherein a row of image elements share a housing.</p></li>

<p>When the system was first introduced Microsoft stated that when released the system would not work at ALL unless you had the kinect hooked up.  Public outcry made them change their decision on that.  But how long until you find out that most games you want to play &quot;won&#39;t work at all&quot; unless you have the kinect on?  They will find some stupid reason to do it.  Like make one tiny part of the game controlled by hand motion only or you have to use your voice and actually SAY a password to enter an area or something.  You&#39;ll see.  I&#39;d bet anything on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why?</p>

<p>And I guess Bill Gates is as evil as the IT people used to claim. And let him do all the &quot;good&quot; he wants to in Africa.  In America he&#39;ll always be known as the devil.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m been thinking about &quot;Why&quot;. And I don&#39;t think the government, certainly not under Obama, cares that much about us. But who does? The plutocracy. Our capitalist masters. Fascism is a merging of state and corporate power. And corporations want to know everything about us. So they can use us. Control us. Exploit us. Like a diary farmer wants to know about his cows. When they wake, when they eat and how much and what. When they exercise. And how they can best be exploited. </p>

<p>It is our masters who want to know everything about us. And once the republicans are in control again, they will use all Obama has let be collected. They will hurt anyone who they think might resist them. Or who just will not produce enough to satisfy them. It is they who want 1984. Occupy was undermined by the corporations working with the government. </p>

<p>Worse times are coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the Xbones come with kinect.  The Kinect see&#39;s everything in front of it, and with wifi it&#39;s even possible to see through walls.  The Kinects IR camera can even see you in the dark.  It can tell what content stimulates you, what content upsets you.  It broadcasts all of this to Microsoft who in turn sells it to marketers.  And the NSA records it all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theorists and technology scolds are crucifying Microsoft for putting a gesture recognition feature on their new game console. This system, &quot;Kinect,&quot; was created to compete with the Wii, which kicked MS&#39; ass last generation. The new Kinect allows you to navigate with voice commands and uses facial recognition to log into your profile. Because of all the NSA leaks, normal people are rightly concerned about gov&#39;t intrusion into their private conversations, while the conspiracy people (to grossly generalize) seem to think this the coming of 1984.</p>

<p>The result will be that lots of these game consoles will indeed sit in people&#39;s homes, a very very few will be used to monitor people directly, everyone will have more data about them generated for marketing research, and ultimately nothing important will happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Xbox One owner here. The system isn&#39;t creepy at all.  It&#39;s a carefully built system that seamlessly integrates voice and gesture control into your TV. So far I am very happy with my xbox one.  If ur so worried about ur privacy then I would recommend avoiding the entire internet as we know it.  What you&#39;re afraid of is called data mining and every tech giant right now uses it to monetize their services.  If u have a problem with Xbox then delete ur Google account,  Facebook and Twitter.  Microsoft is an easy target because of its unpopular public image especially with the younger generation.  Face it... The only way tech companies can make money is through advertising, PERSONALIZED advertising, so if u want to see continued advancement of the internet in general u need to let this happen.  Oh,  and just so u know there&#39;s a lengthy privacy settings options section on the Xbox One so if it really bothers you, u can turn off a lot of the features that freak u out. And half of the data ur afraid the Xbox One is stealing from u without ur knowledge is most likely data and information about urself that most people willingly give out to other companies like Facebook and Twitter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This entire statement exhibits a complete lack of understanding of the Xbone&#39;s technology. I&#39;m not going to spend 20 minutes refuting your claims one by one, but if you understood how the Kinect works, you wouldn&#39;t be whipping yourself into a paranoid frenzy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this: the Kinect can&#39;t see your cock, and the Xbox is most certainly NOT always listening. Secondly, if the government wants to know what you are eating for lunch, all they have to do is point a satellite at you. We have already lost the privacy war, might as well play some video games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve lost the privacy war unless courts redefine privacy expectations. Law is slow to adapt and the way technology and privacy were analyzed traditionally was whether you &quot;gave&quot; a third party access to something. If you did, you had no privacy expectation. The problem with that is currently we are forced to &quot;give&quot; third parties access to just about everything we do. Either the law changes or we basically don&#39;t have any privacy, as you say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A slippery slope is a type of logical fallacy because it is an argument whose premise tends towards hyperbole. It&#39;s also like a strawman because the person employing it can&#39;t argue with the idea itself, so wants to argue with a different idea which is more obviously objectionable. Most importantly, the slope might be imagined to slide in either direction, because the slope does not exist. </p>

<p>You might say that we can&#39;t allow homosexual marriage, because it&#39;s a slippery slope and soon we&#39;d end up with beastiality and pedophile marriage. That would be exactly as logical as saying we have to allow homosexual marriage or soon they&#39;ll be outlawing other kinds of marriage, and then we&#39;ll all live in a Huxleyian dystopia where love is a crime and reproduction a regulated, industrial affair. </p>

In line at a restaurant/gas station/grocery store/ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE line is not the place for you to be rude to others simply doing their job because you think it&#39;s an inconvenience that they&#39;re talking to you while you&#39;re on the phone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any statistics to back this up, but I can only assume that the trading of nude pictures to people that shouldn&#39;t be seeing them has risen ten fold since the personal cell phone boom. And as many people have said, you see kids as young as four, five, or six knowing how to use these things extensively. I&#39;m sure this is going to continue to turn out wonderfully for our society.</p>

<p>Simply put - Technology is great, but too much of it ruins the basic human social interaction. When I was growing up, I couldn&#39;t wait to get outside and play sports, hide and seek, go fishing, whatever... just be outside! Now you drive past playgrounds and kids sit on swings and benches playing games on tablets, phones, e-readers, laptops, whatever... I just think it&#39;s sad. It&#39;s not antisocial in the least, but it&#39;s completely changed human life as a whole. If you can&#39;t see that, I feel sorry for you.</p>

<p>As for the microphone, I haven&#39;t figured out how to dig those out of a prefab mac. Which is why I will be building a computer myself with zero cameras or microphones</p>
