        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During the shutdown, tensions were high for everyone, even those of us who wernt even caught in the left-right paradigm. During this time, my friend and I took it upon our selves to take advantage of the moment to spread the message; as we too were sick and tired and fed up of the constant bending over we as a nation have to endure </p>

<p>My friend and I debated whether or not to upload the footage and to share the story, as we were tricked and followed for 3 days by an undercover spook who baited us with statements like &quot;man every time i see a bank i wish i could just blow it up&quot;. Sure, We were smart enough not to fall for such tricks but he was crafty and we dont know what he was looking for and what he got. The spook, whos allegedly named Kevin, took major interest in us the day before (Friday) after we hopped the barricades a first time. He lied, claiming to work for Rand Pauls office to gain our trust, only then proceeded to follow us around for 3 days protesting &quot;with&quot; us, slipping bits of extremism into the conversation aswell as hitting every political issue. But this is a story for another day.</p>

<p>Some back story: As i said, this was during the shutdown. Specifically the day before the vets went to DC (it was a Saturday if memory serves). Im the charming fellow in the black hoodie, my friend has the bullhorn. The man in the yellow was a fellow patriot we met the day before, who we called crazy Dave. The lanky motherfucker with the green hat is the spook (we have footage proving this aswell).   </p>

<p>Some of you may ask, so what? i jumped over the pieces of metal, nothing big.</p>

<p>Well, sit down children and ill explain. With a 40 dollar bullhorn, a 10 dollar sheet of plastic and a roll of red tape, my friend and I were able to spread the message to over a hundred people within minutes, aswell as send a powerful message to the head of DC police (who no doubt sent it up the chain).</p>

<p>Whats not pictured is the other 5+ hours of pacing the streets of DC bull horning facts about Obama, the DHS and the left-right paradigm. We bullhorned the capital. We bull horned busses. We bullhorned strangers. We bull horned police. We bull horned the SS and the White house. We had people pulling open their phones and googling what we were saying just to prove us wrong and laugh, only to drop their jaws in disbelief after they see the truth behind it. undercover were walking back and forth keeping an I on us.</p>

<p>The point is, if 2 people, 20 minutes worth of effort and a 40 dollar bullhorn was able to do all that, who the fuck can look me in the eye and say 1 person cant make a difference? id call them a damn liar because ive seen it happen, I <em>DID</em> it.</p>

<p>&quot;but whats so special about doing actual physical protesting?&quot;</p>

<p>Good question. </p>

<p>because we live in a society, where people simply <em>doing things</em> in public draws attention like some sort of circus show. Youtube is FILLED with videos of people walking around in a ridicules hat, flash mobbing, singing randomly, preaching with some guy hiding in the bushes laughing his ass off because people are looking at his friend do silly things. And every single time, people are SURPRISED and simply CANT BELIEVE that this thing is happening infront of them. We are so disconnected as a society from phones, TV and internet, that doing things in public gets more attention than if you were to send a message out online. </p>

<p>Its sad, really, to know how far society has degraded. However, when you step out of their rules and framework, and cast aside fictions restraints, such as &quot;i dont want them to think im weird&quot; you step out of the matrix and you literally can see the fog the mass of people are in. Youre not &quot;weird&quot; youre forming your own bubble of reality and you are FORCING anyone who walks by to be a part of it. THEY are the weird ones, floating along life as drool drinkers, unaware of the events that are goiong to come crashing down on their skulls; you no longer abide by the rules set for us by society. The word &quot;sheep&quot; couldnt be any more fitting. You can see how your words on a crowd can literally sway the people. And for a moment, you assume this is what politician giving a speech feels. You could tell these people anything, and if it sounds good they will believe it. But we used this for good to spread the truthful information. I am awake and aware, and as such I have a responsibility to guide and help those who are not as best I can.</p>

<p>The time has come to get out of the house and hit the street. You think just 1 person cant make a noticeable impact? Youre 110% wrong. So go out there and buy a sign, or make one. Just make it big. Hit the street, yell it at the top of your lungs. Yes you will get flicked off, and yes you will be confronted; but you are no longer apart of the matrix, you are outside of it. You are armed with knowledge and the truth cuts the lies like a knife. Some guy called you a &quot;faggot asshole&quot;? laugh it off, hes a bumbling sheep who doesnt know any better and you have bigger fish to fry. Just know that what you speak IS the truth, whether or not they believe you is irrelevant.</p>

<p>So here is what my friend and I did. i hope it will inspire you all to engage in acts of peaceful civil disobedience and peaceful protest. We have 3 days worth of footage filmed, though theres only 1 on our channel (Stop Tyranny). We will be uploading the rest of our footage from that weekend soon. </p>

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/cDmPcsi.jpg?1">Freedom was rung, and heard</a>    </p>

<p>With these new rising tensions, i hope that all of you will take some cues from us and begin expressing your dissent. If every day, 3 or 4 people independent of each other simply hit the streets, change in this country will happen quickly. So what if you get arrested? so what if youre attacked by police? This revolution wont happen with everyone sitting back. Just like the blacks fighting for civil rights, you need to come to terms with the fact that the hoses and dogs HAVE to come out and YOU are going to be the guy who gets hit.   </p>

<h2> So what the fuck are you waiting for? Hit the streets!!</h2>

    <div class="md"><p>Note, we didnt come to the realization until after the fact and confirmed it when looking over the footage we have. I recorded the initial conversation we had with the guy and my friend and I looked over it very carefully. its a LONG video as we talked for close to an hour, it WILL be put up on here and youtube in the future.</p>

<p>So heres what happened:</p>

<p>After we hopped the barricades that friday and were on our way down the steps, he was waiting at the bottom. he gave us some high-fives and then pulled us aside after we posed for a few pictures and shook a few hands. He began saying how he worked for Rand Paul, who apperantly &quot;threw his hands up&quot; and said to go find out whats happening (even though we were bullhorning the capital building 30 minutes prior). He was wearing a black suit, dark shoes and looked very professional. It was lightly rainging all day so he had an umbrella (i mention this because its a key point).</p>

<p>We just hopped a barricade and argued with some cops with a bullhorn so we were pretty pumped, full of addrenaline and quickly believed him. From then on wed be talking about politics, where he began to go down a list of topics and our opinions of them. 9/11, boston bombings, RINOs and DINOs, gun control, how we feel about Obama, and even <em>abortion</em> ( we were 4 guys bitching about the government and abortion makes its way in the convorsation? huh?). </p>

<p>After we talked to the guy (Kevin), we were about to leave; but right before we spun around and walked away, Crazy Dave made a comment about how &quot;if the founders were still alive thed be shooting&quot;, and then suddenly this Kevin fellow, pulled out his phone and began texting someone and had revitalized interest in us and our cause and wanted to follow us around and talk more....but only for an hour because he &quot;needs to meet his girlfriend&quot;. </p>

<p>Also, our friend Dave came from Penn. and made the comment of having to sleep in his Jeep. Kevin instantly, with no hesitation, OFFERED to room him at the <em>Churchill Hotel</em>. Now If youre not familiar with the Churchill you didnt comprehend the gravity of what happened. In the Winston, the cheapest room is 999.99 a night, its not some place you toss a stranger with a stragly beard and worn clothes who you just met. there are some real high class people in this joint. even the burgers are like 20 bucks.</p>

<p>While we walked, we asked him the guy on the &quot;inside&quot; about what the scoop is. But the thing is, we were NEVER wrong with this guy. Everything we said was 100% accurate and spot on, which is horseshit. Even amongst the vets we talked to (who were all on the same page) still had some minor differences of opinion or slightly conflicting news, but we just simply could not be wrong with this Kevin guy. He made it seem like we figured it all out and that there were no more secrets int he government.</p>

<p>What really gave it away, was 6 hours later (he was still with us) the sun was setting and we were heading to the Churchill while dave followed us in his Jeep. My friend (who was driving) didnt bopther to use his GPS since we had a DC native guiding us, but i popped mine open anyways and searched for the winston and muted the navigation sound on my phone. This is where it gets crazy: Kevin was telling my friend directions; left, right, straight etc, but when i was looking i my phone we wernt even CLOSE to where we needed to go. we were taking lefts when we should be going right. heading south when the hotel is north.</p>

<p>We LITTERALLY spent close to 2 hours driving around in CIRCLES, all while Kevin repeatdely answered his phone calls and was whispering<sup>&quot;hey.</sup> <sup>yeah</sup> <sup>im</sup> <sup>with</sup> <sup>the...the</sup> <sup>a....the</sup> <sup>guys.</sup> <sup>yeah.</sup> <sup>from</sup> <sup>the..the</sup> <sup>thing...yea...15</sup> <sup>minutes....</sup> <sup>ok.</sup> <sup>alright.</sup> <sup>uhuh.&quot;</sup></p>

<p>The next few days were far less strange. He joined us in our protesting and even hopped the barricades with us and bullhorned the crowd while we did our thing. </p>

<p>He asked us to meet him for drinks at a taco joint down the street from congress the following week. Lots of interns and staff visit and it was the only bar ive been too that had CSPAN playing on the TV. Kevin was late, so we texted him. he said he was 15 minutes away and had to go home to change. He never showed up and dropped contact form us for close to 2-3 weeks. When he did finally respond to the texts he gave some BS remark of &quot;ill call you from a secure line&quot; (which he never did).</p>

<p>To finally settle the issue, we actually called Rands office in DC and told them there was a guy protesting with us claiming to work for his office. They asked for a name and quickly told us &quot;yeah we dont have anyone who works here with that name&quot;. </p>

<p>He was a nice guy and we would have hung out and grabbed a beer with him if he wasnt a secret squirrell. On the other hand, its his job to have a good personality.</p>

<hr/>

<p>now, above i said i mentioned he was wearing a suit, an umbrella and was in the rain. This is a key point because this man claimed he WALKED from the capital to the lincoln. yet, there wasnt a single drop of water on him when he got to the Lincoln. And you can see it in the video, for 10 minutes this man is completely dry talking to us, after the 10 minutes you can see his coat, pants and shows getting wet from standing and walking in the rain. Its easily at least a 30 minute walk from where this man said he was walking from.</p>

<p>Also, we didnt notice till watching the video, but while talking to us, he kept looking towards his left towards the road. clearly looking at something that interested him. This leads us to believe he was dropped off from a car or van and he was looking towards his partner/cooworker for cues. This explains his dry clothes and constant pearing over</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! the more the better! send me a message with your email (or facebook if youre willing to share that) and well keep in touch. </p>

<p>were trying to keep the number of people below 5 as i vaguely remember reading something about needing a permit if you have any voice amplifiers and are in a group above 5 people. Also, I think its more effective with small pockets of people hitting the streets than a big event that pulls several hundred or thousand. </p>

<p>And sadly no, i did not go to Chantilly that day, though i wish i could have. dont remember why not, it was like 4 months ago haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the guy in the tan &quot;Don&#39;t Tread On Me&quot; shirt. Everyone should be protesting in the streets, even if it&#39;s just by themselves for an hour a week. </p>

<p>It spreads the message. Personally being out at the DC million vet march/truckers ride I can confirm that the media completely ignored the event. When the mainstream media did cover the story, for the most part it was them showing ONE guy with a confederate flag. In reality I would say he literally was the only person out of about 3000 that had a confederate flag.</p>

<p>The media is a complete joke, there were people of all ages/races/genders, to put it simply just a lot of Americans who were awake at what the government as a whole is doing to screw us.</p>

<p>Call your local representatives, go out and protest, defend your rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the vids i posted dont show any of that, just us hopping the barricades and DC police training in action (hehehe). We will be uploading the rest of the footage in its raw format soon and those have us yelling things. (though i didnt record us walking the streets and yelling, plenty of middle fingers and laughs in that footage B-D )</p>

<p>but in answer to your question, we tried to stick with the facts. specifically things that could be proven on the spot with no discussion. No point in having 2 or 3 hands stick up and try to debate us all while a crowd of people are listening to the back and forth. We had a steamroller mentality, kind of like: &quot;these are the facts. period. if you think otherwise you are misinformed and wrong. deal with it&quot;.</p>

<p>I cant say what worked &quot;the most&quot; as i was in the moment myself aswell as yelling things AND trying to keep a good shot with the camera. There were TONS of phones out, more so after we began challenging people to look up what were saying; but whether or not they were texting, taking picture/video or googling, i cant say with certainty. However, specifically, &quot;Obama arms alqueda, google it&quot; was our primary weapon and we yelled that most frequently. Its such an outrageous thing to say and guaranteeed to grab attention, but even more outrageous when several reputable news sites have it as a headline. When people would walk by a flick us off or laugh wed challenege them to pull open their phone right there and almost get angry with them to show how serious we were.  </p>

<p>We also talked about DHS buying billions of hollow point rounds and paper targets opf pregnant woman and children for &quot;no more hesitation&quot;. We talked about how General Wesly clark admitted to plans of invading the middle east. We talked about how obama said while campaigning that raising the debt cieling was a failure of the administration, but today he says its normal practice. The NSA spying on you and how they lied about that when it was first leaked by snowden and sooooo many other things. </p>

<p>Honestly, there is ALOT you can say. Just go out and say it. Aside from my buddy and I agreeing not to give the people too much of the &quot;red pill&quot; , we didnt reherse or practice wording our sentances. we bought our stuff, jammed out in the car on the way to DC, made the sign we had on the wet rainy side walk and then we winged the rest. Stick to the facts, and make the message pro-liberty (as to not isolate any group); remember its the people vs state, always has been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you man! Seriously...awesome.</p>

<p>One thing truly sucks though.</p>

<p>If I mentioned a person out in the streets with a <em>bullhorn</em> to ordinary sheeple talking about controversial things--what&#39;s the first thought that&#39;s gonna cross their minds? Hmmm...</p>

<p>Yep, you got it...Zionist-bought-and-paid-for COINTELPRO expert Agent Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Just goes to show you how desperate &quot;they&quot; have gotten...Agent Jones now uses far more &quot;divide and conquer&quot; and &quot;us vs them&quot; tricks to keep his lemmings flocking lately...even hijacking peaceful protests to try and incite violence.</p>

<p>Just be strong, be safe, don&#39;t pull an &quot;Agent Jones&quot; and make your audience think that you&#39;re trying to &quot;lead&quot; them...let them know that you are WITH them...and don&#39;t do what Agent Jones&#39; bosses won&#39;t allow him to do...NAME NAMES! I can&#39;t fight the &quot;banksters&quot; or &quot;the Elite&quot; and Agent Jones and his Zionist bosses know this.</p>

<p>Seriously, THANK YOU for getting off your asses and DOING SOMETHING. Truly inspiring sir. For now just KEEP IT PEACEFUL AND PROFESSIONAL. This will gain more traction than OWS <em>ever</em> had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your motivation. To us we were no different than a town crier warning the townsfolk. We stuck to the hard facts that couldnt be disputed but are hidden from the MSM. arming of alqueda, DHS and hollow point rounds, fast and furious etc. we didnt give much room for people object because we knew they were wrong, we even asked a few people to take the bullhorn and speak their peice and why they think were wrong; none did.
But honestly, we just winged the whole thing but we tried our best to keep it about We The People. Its not left right, black vs white. its the state vs the people, tyranny vs freedom.</p>

<p>because if we can all agree we should be free, thats a point anyone from any side of the political spectrum can strive toward and will solve many of our serious problems</p>

<p>So grab a sign. pound the pavement. this nation will only change when action is taken at the base level. Your knowledge is your sword and your camera is your shield.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good advice xanaxinator. You&#39;re very right about the &quot;leading&quot; thing, and not trying to make it about the presenter of the information, but about the information itself as well as getting everyone involved. I think everyone should go out and buy a megaphone, it&#39;s hard for police/people in their cars to ignore you when you are yelling it :)</p>

<p>I wanted to keep it cool with the police (not calling them SS soldiers, gestapo, etc) but when they are pushing 70 year old veterans around, thumbing at their guns (because some of them really do just want to use them) it&#39;s hard to talk to them with civility and say &quot;we are with you&quot; ya know? I am with PEACE officers, I am with police officers that follow the Constitution. I am NOT with these power hungry thugs that I witnessed at this event.</p>

<p>I do feel somewhat good though because at another event in DC a few weeks ago I walked by a US Park Police officer near the White House, I looked at him and asked him if he was listening to the speaker/paying attention. He actually shook his head yes and smiled. I think a lot of these guys ARE awake they are just at the point where if they don&#39;t &quot;do their job&quot; they&#39;ll get fired, then they can&#39;t feed their families, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shitty situation for all. But in the end, the idea of liberty and freedom is one that everyone should agree with regardless of political beliefs, and we will not be silenced.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

I live in Oregon and am pretty jealous that you guys got to be there and make history at such a epic place and time. Do you guys have a youtube channel with more videos? I need more of this. Also, I went through the pictures and videos you posted in this and did not see the spook guy you were talking about. where is he? and yes im not surprised they would send someone to possibly try and radicalize you and set you up for some crazy shit. or who knows what. If your young and have potential they might just go Fred Hampton on you guys. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only ask you do the same in your city. Not necessarily hop barricades, but simply speaking the truth of whats happening in the world. This not only sends a message to the higher ups but begins waking people up on a local level. The time and place doesnt matter, things are going nowhere fast in this country and being stagnant will not solve the problems.</p>

<p>And yes we do have a youtube channel, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxR--p03fvYUcHk1FXrWZaA/videos">Stop Tyranny</a>. We only have that one video up but we will be uploading more this week. No editing, just raw footage. i think the next video will be meeting the spook and talking to him. </p>

<p>And lastly, the spook is the guy in the bright green hat, white shirt and flipflops. You can see him int he &quot;lend me your ears&quot; picture and you can see him hopping the barricades with us. he befriended us and we really believed him until the excitement wore off.</p>

<p>But i look at it like this: 3 guys, hoods, backpack, sunglasses, megaphone and anti-government speech while hopping barricaded memorials per the executive branches orders.</p>

<p>its not hard to see why theyd send a guy out, so i dont blame them for that, just the continuous deception. we rubbed elbows with what could have been 1 backpack away from a false flag, or even simply arrest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust me dude after watching this and reading what you said about how easy it is to make a difference and get noticed, I really want to get out there and make a few videos. I&#39;ve had a few ideas of what to do like, holding a sign next to the highway near my house, putting stickers with messages EVERYWHERE(scotch tape with writing on it to avoid vandalism lol), and putting messages on peoples cars(paper). Are you guys going to dedicate your youtube channel to videos like this? I would deff be interested in something like that.</p>

<p>We just want to go out and rally up &quot;We the People&quot; dropping the whole left/right paradigm when talking to people. Both sides are screwing the American people and it&#39;s time for us to stand up and speak out against these laws before it&#39;s too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im confused aswell. do you mean the hopping barricades in defiance of white house orders while staring down the nearly 30 DC police and bullhorning the crowd of people for several hours about how the president arms Alqueda (among other things), or the posting of this topic asking for others to get active and participate in similar activities?</p>
