<p>Well, it seems ISON has broken out of its burial plot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25143861">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25143861</a> </p>

<p>Yup, Zombie Ison is back from the dead in a different form and with a different trajectory, possibly coming much closer to Earth than previously announced (watch this space).</p>

<p>Is NASA really this useless, or have they been feeding us with blatant disinfo all along? </p>

<p>Edit: The concerted downvoting (be from it shills or morons) for all my comments is very telling. The next few weeks will reveal what ISON really is, so watch this space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NASA have repeatedly given the wrong information about ISON. They have maintained for virtually a whole year that it was hyperbolic, hyperbolic, hyperbolic and then last week they said &quot;oh no, it&#39;s periodic&quot;, only they couldn&#39;t decide on how long ISON&#39;s cometary period is or where it even originates from (Oort cloud or maybe not).</p>

<p>Then they announce that it died, and then they announce it&#39;s back it again, bigger and much brighter than before. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m asking you - are NASA really as clueless about ISON as they have been making out or have they actually been hiding the truth about ISON, because it might be a bit doomy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They said it was dead yesterday. They called it (they didn&#39;t have to) and yet now it&#39;s &quot;alive&quot; again. They didn&#39;t predict that.

    <div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;they called it, they didn&#39;t have to&quot; you act as if they wrote out a death certificate and that was officially end of story. Everything that happened is really quite simple to understand. Comet was predicted to probably not survive it&#39;s encounter with the sun, and if it did it could be an amazing comet or it could have most of its mass wiped out. It appears that it did have a lot of it&#39;s mass wiped out, but it looks like it may have survived. Just as predicted. The comet has no chance of impact with the earth, as has been stated the entire time. NASA isn&#39;t lying about what happened with ISON, the fact of the matter is that we are talking about an object that is only a couple of miles in size against the backdrop of the solar system. Perfect forcasting and updates is not going to happen, and a lack thereof is not a sign of a conspiracy. I really enjoy this sub, but I can see why all the mods and everyone are wanting to split. Too much talk of reptile shapeshifters and alien comet spaceships. And why is it that every single time a comet rolls by the sun there is always a shitload of people thinking it&#39;s the end of the world. What people should be concerned about with ISON is simply did it survive, and if it did is it going to be as beautiful as we hope it could be. </p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t understand the kinda budget, human resources and equipment that NASA has at its disposal? And yet they couldn&#39;t even get the story straight on whether ISON was periodic or hyperbolic? Declared ISON dead only to embarrassingly retract hours later? </p>

<p>If you want to argue NASA aren&#39;t clueless, then then you need to explain their bizarre behaviour as regards ISON over the past 11+ months.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>I will add not 100% of NASA&#39;s budget is following ISON, Curiosity is on Mars for example. That is a pretty big affair</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That bit you truncated when you quoted me - the bit that says &quot;watch this space&quot; - did you not understand that? English not your first language?</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a lot of reliable information on the orbit/trajectory because they are &quot;recalculating&quot; it. But seeing as you&#39;re so impatient, I read that JPL are predicting ISON will pass closest to Earth on 31/12 whereas they initially predicted it for 26/12. If that is true then the trajectory must be different, because Earth will have moved some 13,000,000 km (107,000 kmh) in those five days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, what&#39;s your story now?  Again, I&#39;d love to see information about your <strong>personal</strong> observations of the comet that contradict what NASA and other agencies have said.  Please include any images that you have taken of ISON and cross-reference them with some kind of star observation program and how your observations differ from the information available in those.  Cartes du ciel should be good for this purpose.</p>

<p>Please also post any observations from the past few days, as you are saying that somehow the comet has been resurrected, although it&#39;s now clear that this information was posted in haste to get news about the comet to an anxious public, you seem to believe that it&#39;s some kind of conspiracy.  Since you have to have evidence beyond simply conjecture, we can compare observations and images once you post yours.  As I was observing (or rather trying to observe) the comet yesterday morning, I&#39;m excited to hear what you saw that would lead you to believe that these agencies are lying to us.  Yesterday the remnants of ISON would have been (if visible) near the planetary pair of Saturn/Mercury in the morning sky, with Separation: +09?06&#39;25.1&quot; PA:20 from the moon which was nearly invisible.</p>

<p>I look forward to your images and observations.</p>

<p>But thank you for your sharing your personal observations (or rather lack thereof). Since the full import of ISON will not be known until Earth passes through its debris field in mid-january, I suggest you come back with some more personal anecdotes then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the truth about ISON is probably in there somewhere. </p>

<p>This barrage of inconsistency reminds me of the multiple versions or reality disseminated by Associated Press (and the media generally) in the immediate aftermath of Sandy Hook. They put out so much disinfo from &quot;unattributed sources&quot; it allowed the truth (that it was a hoax) to remain camouflaged.</p>

<p>and with a different trajectory, possibly coming much closer to Earth than previously announced</p>

<p>Where in your linked article did you find this information?</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>I will add not 100% of NASA&#39;s budget is following ISON, Curiosity is on Mars for example. That is a pretty big affair</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That bit you truncated when you quoted me - the bit that says &quot;watch this space&quot; - did you not understand that? English not your first language?</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a lot of reliable information on the orbit/trajectory because they are &quot;recalculating&quot; it. But seeing as you&#39;re so impatient, I read that JPL are predicting ISON will pass closest to Earth on 31/12 whereas they initially predicted it for 26/12. If that is true then the trajectory must be different, because Earth will have moved some 13,000,000 km (107,000 kmh) in those five days. </p>
