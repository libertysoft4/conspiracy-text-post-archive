        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of talk about why governments hate bitcoin and how bitcoin is invulnerable to them, but here is an easy way for it to make the new currency illegitimate.</p>

<p>As many know, Bitcoin has been on a meteoric rise moving from $13 to about $140 in about 4 months.  I suspect the reason for this rise could be mass purchasing by large governments in order to bubble the currency ultimately culminating with a mass sell off. The fabricated crash would lead to the illegitimization of the currency removing the competition, illegal trade and money laundering threat.  </p>

<p>Anticipated chain of events:</p>

<p>1) Buy a significant portion of the Bitcoin market, probably anywhere from 30-60%</p>

<p>2) Price rises significantly on mass demand. Creates market frenzy, many jump in on the gold-rush, increased press and attention.</p>

<p>3)Flood market with amassed portion. Market crashes, confidence lost. Future virtual currencies are also called into question.</p>

<p>The plan is feasible for the following reasons...</p>

<p>-There are roughly 11 million Bitcoins in existance, the current price is $140 thus, the entire Bitcoin market is worth ~$1.5 billion. For argument sake, the plan is already in action(hence, the rapid rise) and is 50% complete, the earlier purchases were made at a lower price b/c the supply was greater. The price tag of $1.5 billion is feasible for a large government, and only a small percentage of this is necessary to trigger a parabolic rise. </p>

<p>-Bitcoins do not have a unified exchange structure. For this reason, no one can tell where the movements are coming from and going. The privacy of the Bitcoin may work against itself.</p>

<p>What would be the benefit of crashing the market versus buying and holding? It seems like crashing the market would give bitcoin the opportunity to rebound, placing the hypothetical government(s) in the same situation that they had started in. </p>

<p>However, if the government(s) were to buy and hold then bitcoin would come to a stagnant halt. Doing so wouldn&#39;t be so much a loss as it would be a protection or insurance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The advantage of crashing the market to holding the market seems to be two-fold. First, crashing the market psychologically damages the potential for a rise in a competitor while destroying Bitcoin&#39;s goodwill. It creates an &quot;I told you so mentality&quot; among the gov&#39;t powers. Secondly, crashing the market punishes those are thought to participate in deviant activity using Bitcoin and also insures the reliance on government-lead currencies whereas, holding the currency allows the supposed deviants to prosper on the sale to the larger power upon exit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the current moment, you are correct. All Bitcoins are not for sale. However, as the price of the currency rises due to demand, volume increases and so does the currency&#39;s velocity, eventually the majority of coins will see the open market. Moreover, under the theory, not all coins are required to crash the market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin miner here. If government would buy and hold that would drive the price up and attract more attention. If they buy and dump that would just remove the speculators. I personally don&#39;t really care about the price. For me it&#39;s just a hobby and a game. I made some cash but not millions. I do have some plans in the future to make virtual products and accept only cryptocurrency and I am not alone. There will be always enough people to drive alternative &quot;small&quot; economy either with bitcoins or something similar to it. However, I don&#39;t think cryptocurrency would ever replace real money. </p>

<p>&quot;Government&quot; can kill it easily without investing billions - legalize it and TAX it ! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this would be sneaky, but i don&#39;t know enough about economics to be able to tell if it would work or not.  regardless, bitcoin is pretty revolutionary so it remains to be seen if it could rebound from a blow like the one you&#39;re describing.</p>

<p>if the government wanted to be tyrannical about it they could just order all ISP&#39;s to block the protocol that bitcoin operates on.  they considered doing this with bittorrent but lost in the courts because of all of the legitimate uses bittorrent has.  that being said, i wouldn&#39;t put it past the current administration to say something like, &quot;bitcoin funds terrorism, and therefore all bitcoin transactions will now be blocked.&quot;  it&#39;s entirely possible from a networking standpoint.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a while since I looked at SSL, I don&#39;t use bitcoin.</p>

<p>Basically, yes. Both machines using bitcoins must have access to keys; which means either you must use a public service to access your personal keys or carry them on you privately. However both parties must support SSL.</p>

<p>There are other means of encrypting ones traffic to hide protocols, that&#39;s why I love VPN&#39;s so much. Encrypting the tunnel is pretty standard practice. Also isn&#39;t as time consuming or messy as setting up your own SSL. Just make sure your tunnel comes out someplace where bitcoins aren&#39;t a problem legally and you don&#39;t have much to worry about since law enforcement isn&#39;t allowed to decrypt secure data.. yet.

    <div class="md"><p>bitcoin is p2p, like bittorrent.  also, like bittorrent it operates on it&#39;s on protocol.  ISP&#39;s can block all traffic of a specific protocol on their networks, and ISP&#39;s have to listen to the federal government.  so, yes, it would be that easy.  </p>

<p>the only way to make bitcoin work if all the ISP&#39;s had blocked all traffic on the bitcoin protocol would be if the people constructed a free and open internet that existed parallel to the physical networks owned by the big corporate ISP&#39;s and without a central authority over it.  this is easy to do within a company, home, or even small local area, but to create a new global internet would take decades and billions of dollars.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not a mathematician so i can&#39;t fully explain how it works, but it&#39;s &quot;crypto-currency,&quot;  it&#39;s all based on hashing algorithms based on SHA256 encryption.  every transaction between every wallet is recorded and replicated to every bitcoin node in the network.  the currency is produced by creating &quot;blocks&quot; in a chain - each block is a combination of all transactions since the last block, using a hashed version of the last block as a seed for the next one.  your bitcoin wallet is rewarded with coins if your computer discovers the next block in the chain.  there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins produced, ever, and they&#39;ll be produced with increasing difficulty until that 21million mark is reached, i believe around 2018 or 2020.  also, since there is no central issuing authority and it&#39;s a peer2peer network, the only way to compromise the system to make it appear that you have more bitcoins than you should is to corrupt &gt;50% of ALL the nodes in the network - this would be quite a feat indeed! </p>
