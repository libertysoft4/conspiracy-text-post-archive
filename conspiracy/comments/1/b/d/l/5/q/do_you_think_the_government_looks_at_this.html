When investigating him, they found out he was like, anti-water fluoridation or something.

    <div class="md"><p>I can attest to the fact that that my HIV related posts have garnered US Government (Los Alamos Laboratory scientist) and pharmaceutical (A few people from Merck showed up to call me names) responses before, not on reddit that I am aware, but on Coursera. The Government scientist and I had a pretty lengthy private email conversation about HIV science, and it was somewhat productive... but I felt that he was being somewhat disingenuous to me and attempting to misrepresent specific fraud investigations as well as scientific papers that pointed to a &quot;punctuated cause&quot; of the initial AIDS outbreak. </p>

<p>Other people that go delving into the HIV industry have encountered these same set of people as well.  I&#39;m not sure how organized their monitoring of forums is on certain topics but it appears to exist to some degree... within a few days &#39;they&#39; (coursera allows for anonymous posts, so im not sure who it was exactly) had cross connected all my accounts across Reddit, Coursera, and the Questioning AIDS forums (which isn&#39;t really that difficult, it wasn&#39;t something I was trying to hide...). They additionally had honeypotted my IP address to determine my general location of residence (I stupidly clicked a link the anonymous user provided, and someone told someone where I was located, a piece of information I have been quite careful about not providing). The professor of the class nicely published my real name to the entire class after she hastily banned me (we have since made up realized it was a big misunderstanding and we&#39;re cool now).</p>

<p>I do know that there is a man by the name of Seth Kalichman over at UConn that claims to have &quot;infiltrated denialist groups&quot; through forums and multiple &quot;shadow puppet&quot; accounts. This is the same guy the Gates Foundation has paid 100k to, to handle anti vaccine monitoring in various forums. Is reddit on his radar? I have no idea. </p>
