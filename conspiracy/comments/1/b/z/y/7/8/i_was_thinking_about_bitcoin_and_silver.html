See that huge spike in price back in 1980? Well it is well understood and documented that the 1980 spike was because the Hunt Brothers were trying to corner the market. </p>

<p><a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#tgSzm1g10zm2g25">Here are the historical prices on Bitcoin</a></p>

<p>Is it me or does the bitcoin chart look very similar to the silver chart pre 1980?</p>

<p>The total number of bitcoins is less than 21 million. That is in the software. Even at $200 per bitcoin that only gives us a total market size of $4.2 billion USD. I imagine you could have a major effect on the Bitcoin Market with just 2-4 million BTC, which was less than $1 per in recent memory. </p>

<p>Am I completely off base here, or is it possible the Bitcoin market is being manipulated? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not anything close to being well-informed on this but here&#39;s how I look at it: The ruling elite are bankers. Just like when Lincoln/US brought into being the Greenback, albeit for different reasons, the European bankers could not let that currency stand because they could not control it. Same goes with this; however, it is not Bitcoin itself that directly threatens them. It is the idea of a uncontrolled currency being used on a global scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the idea can be quickly killed by media. Just publish threatening articles about bitcoins being used to fund terrorists and bad guys using to hide taxes, later &quot;to protect citizens&quot; issue the law to forbid any legal company to accept currency &quot;used by terrorists&quot; and job done.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that some might try to squash bitcoin, and that these instances have already occurred to some extent.  But, any Idea which is born out of selflessness and altruism can not be destroyed.  It&#39;s very much like artists, or revolutionary scientific breakthroughs/minds,  which cannot be fully appreciated, fully realized, within their own lifetime.  They may feel defeated and may never personally reap the rewards of their hard work and sacrifice.  However, with patience and enough time the seeds they&#39;ve planted will ultimately flourish in ways even they themselves could not possibly have imagined.  No one, no number of people, can exterminate an Idea such as the one represented by bitcoin.  What most won&#39;t realize is that the very propaganda used in attempts to destroy the Idea ultimately becomes the very potent fertilizer which nourishes the Idea into blossoming and flourishing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is almost a fact that the Bitcoin market is manipulated.  But the questions should be &quot;by whom?&quot; and &quot;for how long?&quot;  You can look through the history of Bitcoin trading all the way back to when it was less than $1, and see that several very public manipulations of the Bitcoin market have been attempted, have been successful for a time, and have eventually succumbed to the will of the market.</p>

<p>At one time, a fairly average individual could have a huge impact on the Bitcoin market.  And they did.  Back when it was big enough to matter, someone took out a $20,000 short position, and made the mistake of announcing it on the forums.  Someone else decided to spike the price and squeeze their position.  They both lost out in the end.</p>

<p>Then it took a wealthy individual.  Look up pirateat40.  He manipulated the price for over 6 months, with the help of some very gullible investors.  Then his ponzi scheme collapsed.</p>

<p>Today it requires a corporation.  And just because manipulation is a game that is destined to failure, doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t happen.  It&#39;s entirely likely that some corporation, Google or Apple or Western Union, is currently eyeing the Bitcoin market.  They may even already be there.  And there is no way to predict their motives or effect.</p>

<p>Soon, however, Bitcoin manipulation will be left to governments and banks.  That&#39;s when the real fun begins.  Hedge funds and private investors are already taking bites at Bitcoin.  The early adopters will be mostly rational, profit-driven.  But soon some bigger fish will show up, and try to eat the Bitcoin market before it gets too big.  I for one don&#39;t think they will be successful.  But it should be interesting regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin is a textbook seigniorage scheme. It&#39;s just like cap-and-trade, only it turns out developers/&#39;hackers&#39; are a lot more gullible than even pseudo-sovereign nations.</p>

<p>The key to understanding scams is understanding when the money is made. The majority of the money was made when the currency was initially inflated into having value, then sold into circulation (seigniorage: &#39;Satoshi Nakamoto&#39;). The illusion of supply control comes from their extremely complicated and pointless explanation for &#39;mining&#39; bitcoins (tell me, why didn&#39;t they just create all the bitcoins at once? How were the first several million created, they certainly weren&#39;t &#39;mined&#39; over decades). The &#39;walking around&#39; money is made through manipulating the exchange, which the currency creators still do. The coke and hookers money will be made when they dump and walk. </p>

<p>If you notice, the biggest rallies in Bitcoin are always right after a bug, hack, or flash crash. It is after moments like this that the illusion is most vulnerable; people are in danger of remembering there&#39;s no value underlying this currency and enormous counterparty risk, especially given the resolute anonymity of the market markers. So whenever something &#39;bad&#39; happens, the ensuing &#39;rally&#39; is always enormous, inflating the value to new highs and bringing roaring PR back. No one seems to remember the very real existential flags being thrown up by these crashes; the entire &#39;wallet&#39; concept was just irreparably broken by hackers and yet the PR machine has us singing praises about this thing? A major inflection point just showed in the market, it was immediately papered over with PR and now everything is okay? Everyone seems to forget that unnatural market behavior like this is more evidence of manipulation, and therefore of enormous risk (particularly at value peaks, as any one could be the last).</p>

<p>By the time you realize the pump is over, they&#39;ll be counting your money on their own private island in micronesia because you have no idea who the cabal behind &#39;Satoshi Nakamoto&#39; even is. One of the first red flags to look for within a seigniorage scheme is anonymity of its members. Cue Bitcoin, Jekyll Island &amp; Federal Reserve, etc.</p>

<p>Nothing about bitcoin is like silver. Bitcoin operates in concert with the fiat ponzi because it&#39;s a ponzi fiat. Silver is a physical commodity, it is an insurance policy against things like the Federal Reserve Note and bitcoin. The spike in silver came when the Hunt Brothers realized the supply of physical silver collateralizing the fiat market was too small to be sustainable, and decided to prove it by cornering enough of the silver supply to prevent the J.P. Morgue from shorting it as effectively (as they still do on a daily basis). Their lives were nearly destroyed until they gave their position up, which allowed the market to return to its manipulated state.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, by contrast, is just being pumped because its investors are being pumped. By the time y&#39;all see the brick wall at the back of the theater, it&#39;ll be way too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is wrong on so many fundamentals.  You obviously do not actually understand how bitcoin works.</p>

<p>Here is 1 example of your lack of understanding:  <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block</a> Only 50BTC were created intially and only 50 per 10 minutes running the hashing algorithm.  They were of 0 value until others agreed to the value through mutual trust of the encrypted exchange capability of the system.</p>

<p>Now Im not saying there isnt market manipulation as a whole or various other oddities.  But what you say above is just fundamentally incorrect and shows more assumption then knowledge.</p>

<p>previous comments from senju:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I signed up. I&#39;m currently running 2 companies and have stake in 3 others (equity for tech/bus dev). I&#39;m definitely interested in getting involved in a bitcoin startup and some of the people I know are interested in investing in something like this.</p>

<p>I have contacts in several VC/Angel circles and know some interesting individuals worth pitching to when the time is right. Bitcoin is still a bit of a hard sell to these east coasters but I&#39;ve managed to get a few monied individuals to jump in recently, so its not impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False.  Im a small technical business owner that wants to get involved in bitcoin b/c I&#39;ve studied the fundamentals, the math, and the technology for a few years and find that it is not lacking.  I have friends who I talk to for FREE.  So no, I dont have significant money in this.  In fact I only own 1 btc right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is all meaningless if the operation is allowed to continue for an arbitrary amount of time before taking it public. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re producing them every 10 minutes or every 10 seconds if they&#39;re falling into the same pockets.</p>

<p>You want a refutation because you&#39;re playing their game. They wave their left hand in front of your face like you&#39;re a monkey (&#39;genesis blocks,&#39; &#39;algorithms,&#39; it&#39;s just too complicated for you to understand...right) and think you&#39;ll ignore the right hand behind their back. </p>

<p>You can create any bogus process you want, but until you take it public you control all of the theoretical production. There is zero transparency about the origination of this currency, but I can guarantee you that until its value was inflated into <em>something,</em> the first bitcoins didn&#39;t change hands. So the question is, who sold the first bitcoins? Because that person made a pile of fucking money out of nothing, and before that they were sitting on a pile of fucking worthless-ass bitcoins until they talked some suckers into this scam.</p>

<p>Any time someone is creating something out of nothing, you should be careful. Any time they won&#39;t tell you who they are, you should be wise. <em>They&#39;re still controlling the fucking exchange these things trade on. Helllooooo...</em></p>

<p>This is a scam and you&#39;ll be taken, unless you&#39;re a paid PR shill for them in which case you&#39;ll continue to try to slide the topic into an arena where your bullshit algorithms and fancy showmanship will carry any weight whatsoever.</p>

<p>If the Bitcoin system survives until all the coins are mined, the year will be around 2140.  <em>If</em> Bitcoin is still in use in 130 years it will probably be an important feature of international trade, and the miners will be rewarded with transaction fees instead of created bitcoins.  Transaction fees already exist (anyone who says otherwise knows about as much about BTC as someone who says silver is easy to find under spot does about the Ag market) so there is no threat of sudden implementation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it highly unlikely that Bitcoin will exist in decades.  The problem with Bitcoin in the long term is that the block chain will grow very large, I&#39;ve heard in the multiple terra byte range.  Its possible that it could grow slow enough that storage capacity and wireless bandwidth outpaces all of this.  Also it is possible that they could create some really slick synching methods.</p>

<p>Basically I&#39;m thinking that in 10-15 years that it will be painfully obvious that the distribution aspect of Bitcoin is 10-15 years old and that new algorithms could do the job better.  Then an incompatible code fork might be necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right.  I have weighed those possibilities, and I am paying close attention to other cryptocurrencies.  If one of them looks clearly better than Bitcoin I&#39;ll trade my small BTC reserves for whatever seems like a better buy.  As of now, my BTC has more than quintupled in value even with today&#39;s sell offs, so I&#39;m going to keep riding this train for awhile.  Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I think some sort of cryptocurrency is going to become a major player on the international scene.  Right now Bitcoin is poised to take that spot, but I may move into something else if there seems to be good reason to do so.</p>

<p>They are saying that gold is plummeting.  That is ridiculous.  It immediately corrected from the top and then has been trading sideways for a while, rather boringly actually and not plummeting.  This is why I like the metals now because people are losing faith and dull journalists find it easy to write yet another article like this.  China is still gobbling up crazy amounts of metals, the bankers are still super eager to get gold like in Cyprus and Libya.  Its a joke.  Gold for the win.</p>

<p>Then there is that guns and ammo thing.  People are not fucking bullish on the economy and rule of law.  Insecurity is still very high and it is still being expressed in other ways if you look for it.  The US employment participation rate (fuck unemployment numbers) is a thirty year low.  What economy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it is being manipulated in my opinion. I checked out the activity on bitcoin.org - which should be good indication of how much interest the general public is taking in this currency. Here are the stats on Alexa: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitcoin.org#">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitcoin.org#</a></p>

<p>You can see from the chart that there is definitely growing interest in bitcoin, but the increase in interest is nothing close to the parabolic rise in price. This is because big money speculators are getting in right now and driving up the price... and a lot of this could have come from a single manipulator (perhaps even operating through various agents).</p>

<p>If I was the Federal Reserve, I would without doubt buy up as many bitcoins as possible... and once it gets really expensive, sell them all off in one go and watch the price plummet. I would then buy them up again at pennies on the dollar. I would make money and destroy the credibility of digital currencies for a good, long while, and still own the currency.
There may still be some time to make money out of this currency, but I would urge you to be careful if you are going to invest in it. </p>

<p>Of course, I could be wrong - but this looks like a total bubble and manipulation to me.</p>

So I decided that a special purpose notebook with a fully open source Linux OS would be the way to go and that ideally it would have a clamshell keyboard and weigh at most half a pound.  That little device would end up being my wallet and it would hardly touch the Internet at all.  I&#39;ve kept my eye on the <a href="http://www.openpandora.org">open pandora</a> but they had problems with the production line and they are around $500.</p>

<p>After all the CIA knew about btc 2 years ago <a href="http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/04/bitcoin-technical-lead-to-present-at.html">http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/04/bitcoin-technical-lead-to-present-at.html</a></p>

<p>when the price was ~$1 and 1 month before the spike in the chart. </p>

<p>Funnily enough I remeber reading that very thread on bitcointalk about 2 yrs ago: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6652.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6652.0</a></p>

<p>If it weren&#39;t for this I&#39;d believe bitcoin had a chance. Since its there I believe they are the MySpace of crypto currency, they fucked it up and there will be a bigger one someday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever the price drops it&#39;s a buying opportunity.  It may be years before spot hits $50 again, but eventually it will.  When that happens some of us qwill be ready to double our money.</p>
