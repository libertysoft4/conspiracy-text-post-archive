<p>So as I am reading the story, sure enough the story said they found a loaded 12 gauge shotgun in the glove box. Now anyone who knows anything about firearms can draw their own conclusions, well because its ridiculous. Evidently the person writing the story doesn&#39;t know squat about them, and bought it hook line and sinker. So I click back from the story, got up to get a friend to show him. Well I come back, and now this is the front page of Drudge <a href="http://i.imgur.com/76XPlvy.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/76XPlvy.jpg</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s gone so I go to my browser history and go back to the AP page, and its changed to this... <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JIJBxBI.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/JIJBxBI.jpg</a></p>

<p>Which is still absurd. Again anyone who knows about firearms is not going to buy this. I have looked, and looked for the cached page of the AP story, but all I come up with is 404 error.. It may not be much, but just enough to call bullshit..... </p>

<p>What prompted the headlines today I guess is the release of the search warrant on Adam Lanza&#39;s house after the shooting... </p>

<p>Edit: Here is a picture of my shotgun. It is a Remington 870. Which is smaller (18&quot; barrel) compared to the one the police found. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/c265t5N.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/c265t5N.jpg</a> I only show this as a comparison, and how absurd it would be to say it was in a glove box or have a 35 round magazine...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone else just pointed out to me that there IS a CZ-83 firearm.  With the terrible typos in these warrants, that could be all there is to it.</p>

<p>They also listed Nancy Lanza&#39;s birthday as 9/6/30 in a couple of places, which would have made her 82.  The black Honda serial number was conflicting in places, too.  Really sloppy work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting how this works:</p>

<p>One guy with the Associated Press writes a super sloppy article, most likely in an alcohol-induced stupor, every other reporter says &quot;great, now I don&#39;t have to do the work&quot;, the story is picked up by every major newspaper in the country and now there actually <strong>was</strong> a shotgun and two 35 round (?) magazines in the <strong>glove compartment</strong>. </p>

<p>Now, if you call that into question, you are a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. Later, when they change the facts of the narrative, if you still use the first article as reference, you are now once again a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. The only way to avoid the label, is to keep up with the ever-changing (and ever-conflicting) facts from the six major news outlets.  </p>
