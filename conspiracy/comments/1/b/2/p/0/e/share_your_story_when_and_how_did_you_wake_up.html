    <div class="md"><p>It clicked for me with the Patriot Act. I don&#39;t know exactly what did it for me, but on 9-11 I remember wondering if the government saw it coming but didn&#39;t stop it because they needed an excuse to go to war. I was being mocked (in high school) for not supporting the Patriot Act, which scared the crap out of me, and I thought that maybe wars would just be incidental and that the Patriot Act and other neofascist legislation were what 9-11 was all about. That&#39;s about when I started seriously questioning things.</p>

<p>Edit: I also learned at a young age to push my teachers&#39; buttons to get what I wanted. I was a really manipulative little brat, but I suppose it helped me realize early on when people were trying to manipulate me. And I grew up mostly without a TV, which I&#39;m thankful for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to say that i thoroughly enjoy conspiracydocumentaries.com and that there is much i have learned thanks to that site. </p>

<p>In regard to burning DVDs i have had this thought reoccur periodically in my brain ever since i first saw zeitgeist addendum a few years ago, although i for a couple reasons never got around to it. Mostly because im antisocial and would never hand them out myself, and partly because i dont think people would feel safe putting a burned dvd into their computer. Ive considered just leaving some somewhere (say by the library at my college with a sign and a stack of DVDs) but always figured theyd get snatched by campus security before very many would get picked up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that that the majority of people on this subreddit are somewhere along a varying spectrum of craziness. They think you&#39;re crazy because you believe in a conspiracy they don&#39;t, so they downvote you. They fail to realize that most people view their crazy the way they view your crazy.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t really believe in any true conspiracy theory, but I think UFOs are a lot more plausible than the jewminati. So if it makes you feel better, I think you&#39;re less crazy than your down voters probably are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would make sense not to downvote what you disagree with, but people are too eager to get their version of events out, and go to lengths to put down &quot;disinfo shills&quot;.</p>

<p>This sub isn&#39;t really for all theories or opinions. In fact, the best way I could describe it is as a giant echo chamber. You come in already with some prejudices and opinions you want confirmed, and if you got these opinions from the same BS sources as everyone else here, it gets repeated and regurgitated as if it were the holy gospel.</p>

<p>If you truly want your opinions challenged and would like to enlighten yourself with new perspectives, I would stop using this sub.</p>

<p>The original uploaded by Pilots For 9/11 Truth has been removed by youtube. The full video, which I&#39;ve had trouble finding, has the ACARS data released by NORAD that shows a wargames plane crossing paths with flight 175 over Pennsylvania. It appears that the war games plane continues to New York while flight 175 pings it&#39;s way across Pennsylvania over the ACARS and radar systems eventually being joined by an escort continuing west while going off radar.</p>

<p>Short of that, I&#39;ve always enjoyed reading and analyzing conspiracies, UFOs, blackops, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#7_World_Trade_Center">The one that collapsed after having parts of the other buildings fall on it and then burning for several hours?</a> Yes, I&#39;ve heard of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not American. So no. You realise unrelated criticism of news channels isn&#39;t actually supporting evidence for your claims, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#39;t you ask a structural engineer and see what they say?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you really think there&#39;s a good chance that if I ask any given structural engineer, they&#39;ll probably corroborate that 9/11 was an inside job? Do you think most of them believe that? The link I gave you refers to a report from the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers which investigates the collapse and concludes it was caused primarily by fires.</p>

<p>At any rate, if it was an inside job, why would they make such a transparent mistake? You think they&#39;re capable of covering up the biggest conspiracy in history that must have implicated thousands of people, none of whom spoke out, none of whom were caught by security, demolition, or engineering experts after the fact, but you think they thought no one would notice a skyscraper falling down? Why wouldn&#39;t they just get another plane and fly it into it for good measure? Hell, why even destroy it at all? 2 sky scrapers and thousands of deaths not enough to gain public support for invading the Middle East, or whatever the alleged motives are?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never in history has a building ever collapsed from a fire.  When the buildings collapsed, they fell at near free fall speed. You think that a fire burning only on a section of the building will make it collapse in such a way?  If the structural integrity at the base of the towers were not damaged in any way (which it couldn&#39;t have been because only the airplanes hit the tower, right?) how does it suddenly collapse at near free fall speeds?  </p>

<p>There are plenty of people (civilians, firefighters, policeman) who were there on that day that spoke out to the news saying they heard and felt explosions while in the buildings, from the basement floor on up.  All these testimonies that were recorded on that day was only shown on that day and never again.  Don&#39;t you think eye witness testimony minutes and hours after the event occurred is more reliable than what&#39;s put on on the report of the collapse by people who weren&#39;t there?  Of course you have no idea because you only see what is put on the mainstream media, plus you&#39;re not American so you probably have no idea of how the media works.  Can&#39;t blame you because most Americans don&#39;t either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the government was going to kill an entire church full of people right in front of everyone to see if they could get away with it. </p>

<p>They did the heinous act of attacking and killing innocent American   children  at  nearly point blank range   with military tanks. and got away with it by news media manipulation. It was easy to  see the manipulation since I had been told it would be done.</p>

<p>People were conditioned to scream for action against them. They did as they were manipulated to do. The first thing done at the Davidian&#39;s property was the dogs were all shot and the police presence was done in such a way as to panic those inside into acting brashly.</p>

<p>It worked like a dream for the government and the banking sector which wants almost total control now.. If anyone reading this wants to know the theory the government goes by to manipulate people, see the ideology  and influence of Edward Bernays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely was 9/11. I was in elementary school when it happened. It took only a couple days for what happened to sink in. I didn&#39;t realize how deeply Israel was involved until a few years ago. Once I started looking at who was connected to who, the picture became rather clear.</p>
