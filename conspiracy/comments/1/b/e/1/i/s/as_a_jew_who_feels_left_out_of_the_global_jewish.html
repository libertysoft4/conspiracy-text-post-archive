<p>If you want to be part of the global Jewish conspiracy (as you say you do), you need to go to the source, Israel.</p>

<p>You say that no culture is free of sin, but is that really true? Do you know all cultures so well that you can say this? I doubt it. You just revert to &quot;others are bad, so we can be bad too.&quot; type thinking.</p>

<p>You said you wanted in on their game.....</p>

<p>The Jews are linked together in their little &quot;community&quot;. There is no real difference between the Zionist and the secular Jew. It is a false dicotomy. Any money that you give at Temple, a portion of that goes to Israel.</p>
