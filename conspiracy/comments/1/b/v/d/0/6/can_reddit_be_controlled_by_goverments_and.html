<p>It would be stupid not to do this, because all it takes is creating a bunch of free accounts (and paying the people who use them). Infiltrating hollywood and the mainstream media costs a lot more money. Not that they aren&#39;t doing that already.</p>

<p>Haha. Seriously though I just wanted to point out how simple it would be to have an influence just by creating free accounts. Not to mention mod infiltration, which is also free, but takes more time and effort. But it of course has a much greater reward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lofty notions.  All those &#39;real&#39; things are what get manipulated the most. </p>

<p>They can try to control, but fail.  Multiple accounts don&#39;t work.  Most stories get less than 100 votes, and less than 20 comments. When pro government shills speak up, they stand out like a sore thumb.  It just takes a while to recognize them for what they are.  I see their efforts as an act of desperation.  They are losing and they know it.  Their shills are waking up and switching sides when banks and government stick it to us.  They are getting stuck too, and don&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>The government listens to what Reddit has to say because we are the many. We have changed their policies in a matter of a few days and those policies took months to think out. </p>

<p>The more they try to control, the more of their time they waste.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know exactly, because they don&#39;t warn you or anything, but apparently Dr. Judy Wood is not very popular around Reddit nor r/conspiracy. I don&#39;t know since when but the first time I posted in years was when she was having one of her Psy Ops Recovery Programs. And I posted a link in a 9/11 post wasn&#39;t even a post just a comment. Then bam shadow banned, the sketchy thing is I don&#39;t post much ever nor comment. I lurk more hardly ever participate in commenting, I rather absorb information and acquire knowledge and wisdom. Maybe is paranoia but for an inactive account like mine was, it was too subtle that I mentioned Dr. Wood and didn&#39;t have any down-votes and then I looked into it and I was shadowbanned. If I remember well I made two comments in different posts mentioning her very far apart in time so my guess is the first time I did I got canned and realized just later on after the second comment that I was shadow banned . Basically I don&#39;t comment and when I do I get shadow banned. One of those weird coincidences I guess. If you have the time take a look at the evidence she presents it is quite interesting stuff specially building 7 debris not spilling across the street to the post office where you can see bare sidewalk the 14 people that survive inside one of the towers while the building above and around them didn&#39;t. The first thing I didn&#39;t know that got me was the lack of debris and I didn&#39;t even know that was an issue to start with. That made me realize that we are living in a dark age type of situation and don&#39;t even realize. Call me crazy but when the world around me doesn&#39;t make sense maybe I&#39;m the sane one, sort of. Take care brother or sister humanity is screwed if we can&#39;t see past our differences, once you start digging it feels like humanity never had a fair chance. And the problem should not even be a problem. The problem being the majority of people are too good to believe the stuff that drives this machine. Some people say stupid but I try my best to be compassionate and not to judge others. Be more understanding. But there is a lot of people not well informed. Best wishes and good luck. I&#39;m not religious but I do believe in good and evil and freewill. And use my freewill to do what I can to help and do good. It helps me find peace of mind. I don&#39;t know what you do or if you have kids but in this world tell yourself and teach your kids, to always put the price on the table  (not monetary value) but principle if ever it gets too high of a price or too much of a burden find something else to do. Humanity will thank you and so will your peace of mind. Now I need to take my meds :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure Reddit&#39;s influence is big enough to be worth The Government&#39;s time and effort? Hollywood, certainly. As well as the major news outlets and TV networks. But Reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont thibk just reddit, Internet in general. They have to have &#39;control&#39; over the Internet, it&#39;s the fastest way for information they may not want &#39;leaked&#39; out to the general public. So really my point is you just never know where/what they&#39;re monitoring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Department of Defense wanted a data network that was utterly decentralized and could survive a nuclear attack. The result is the internet: being uncontrollable was pretty much a design requirement. </p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t think it can be controlled by the government - at least not in any subtle way. Obviously China controls <em>their</em> little chunk of the &#39;net, but not subtley and not perfectly.</p>

<p>Monitoring is one thing. <strong>Controlling</strong> is quite another. I&#39;m certain The Government does a great deal of the former and very little of the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean controlling in the sense that the poster says up voting or down voting certain things. I do definitely believe monitoring is a 24/7 operation and with media attention I do think Reddit would be one of many things being monitored. However, the Internet is uncontrollable ( which is why I wrote &#39;control&#39;) but will always be monitored for things that may cause a &#39;red flag&#39;. I&#39;m obviously no expert, just my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kind of sad that you can control what people say by upvoting and downvoting, but the more important tactic is forum sliding, which buries the important data in useless noise, it&#39;s not dependant on votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is one of the top 50 most visited websites in the world, and stuff that hits the frontpage of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> can easily get more than 10 million page views. If the government was spending time trolling internet sites I&#39;m sure reddit would be at the top of the list.</p>
