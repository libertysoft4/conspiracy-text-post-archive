        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been looking into the music industry and their media programming recently.</p>

<p>I will cut the shit and tell you what I came up with.</p>

<p>The Illuminati (hold on, let me finish), when it was first created (by Adam Weishaupt), had a sort of a list of rules. We could go over all of them, but this is mainly about the music industry. One of the rules was to promote alcohol and drug use to the masses for general &quot;control their minds&quot; reasons.</p>

<p>As far as I see, music didn&#39;t start falling into this pit of &quot;sex, weed, parties, and drinking&quot; until rap and hip-hop made a turn in the 80&#39;s.</p>

<p>Ever since thug and hip-hop culture started spreading, there are more impoverished, prominently black communities.</p>

<p>But I am getting off-topic.</p>

<p>People seem to see a repetition of famous artists having the all-seeing eye, the mason square and compass, Baphomet (a demon with horns, usually represented with a hand gesture), anti-government lyrics, and anti-religious lyrics.</p>

<p>After researching videos and lyrics that caused some controversy, a few key artists kept popping up. The few I kept seeing were Beyonce, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Rhianna, Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, and Eminem.</p>

<p>Beyonce portrays herself as a goddess; there is an image of her wearing a strange Baphomet outfit.</p>

<p>Kanye West has many lyrics in his songs &quot;No Church in the Wild&quot; and &quot;Power&quot; that allude to anti-government and anti-religious motives.</p>

<p>Katy Perry, Eminem, and Snoop Dogg (among others) have all said, very seriously, (whether in a music video or in an interview) that they sold their soul to the devil.</p>

<p>The music industry as a whole seems to currently pump out nothing but party songs (pop), riot/anger-inducing songs (rock), and drug/sex-related songs (rap).</p>

<p>The three themes seem to work themselves right into the old Illuminati handbook. Said handbook was conceived in the (edit) 1770&#39;s-80&#39;s.</p>

<p>I would like to hear opinions and speculations on the current state of the music industry. Any other things that should be noted are appreciated and welcomed.</p>

<p>EDIT: I want it noted that I am an atheist, but I do believe that religion will play a role in the &quot;next age&quot;.</p>

<p>Not quite. I have been following the music industry for 40 years personally and have studied the history of music going back the beginning of the 19th Century. Your claim that Rap and/or Hip-Hop of the 80&#39;s was the beginning of this &quot;Illuminati&quot; fueled craze is short sighted. First because the &quot;Illuminati&quot; has been around since the 16th  Century, Second because there have been music styles that were equally bad as far as &quot;Sex, Drugs and Rock n Roll&quot; are concerned. </p>

<p>To start with you are neglecting &quot;Punk&quot; rock. This was started in the late 1960s and gained its height in the early 1980s. These guys were bad ass in the extreme. Look up the name &quot;Sid Vicious&quot; some time. </p>

<p>Next we cover this idea that Black artists are to blame. Only partly. &quot;Sid Vicious&quot; was white. Most of the influential music in the 20th Century, including, but not limited to, Blues, Jazz, Rhythm and blues, Boogie Woogie, Rock and Roll, Sole, Motown and Rap were all Black music. It all started with slaves in the south in the US in the early 19th Century. As far as blaming all this on Blacks, well, no. The white folks are actually worse. In fact, the evil influences you cite have little to do with race.</p>

<p>What you claim are &quot;Illuminati&quot; are merely just wealthy people who are blinded by greed and power who were/are using the music industry for their own gain, just as they do in any other industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that OP had a good post but THIS really put things back into perspective. But you&#39;re not saying that Illuminati symbology is NOT put into some people&#39;s music correct?</p>

<p>For instance, with Lady Gaga it&#39;s simply so outrageously out there...it&#39;s almost cringe-worthy.</p>

<p>I certainly believe that this symbology is used for a purpose--whether it&#39;s &quot;entrainment programming&quot; or just keeping the kiddies familiar with the symbols that are, of course, on MONEY I&#39;m not sure--but after reading an amazing blog post on this I <em>am</em> sure that it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to my recent research, it would seem that there was a Band called The Sonics, out of the UK. They released their first album, called &quot;Here Are The Sonics&quot;, in 1965. It would appear that &quot;Death&quot; released their first album in 1974. I do acknowledge &quot;Death&quot; as a pioneer in the genre, but, they were not &quot;first&quot;, and didn&#39;t, by any means invent the genre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious, what is your opinion on the heavy/thrash metal scene which came out of the &#39;80s? Slayer has always caught my attention and they stand out(to me) as writing very deep music compared with other bands. Many of their lyrics directly speak of deeper topics such as death, spirits, corruption, control, manipulation, psychopaths... also their album &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; was released exactly on September 11, 2001. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t paid a lot of attention to the heavy metal scene. So, in fairness, I am not really the one to answer your question. I will just say that after about 1992 or so, I have, personally, found that the music has lost a lot of its former artistry. I am not attempting to be dismissive of the music, just that I prefer music of an earlier time. As such, I don&#39;t usually have an opinion either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually Punk was the first blatant &quot;rebel&quot; rock that was in your face. But the drinking and weed smoking part started way back in the 1910&#39;s, that is before World War I. Every generation thinks theirs is the baddest one. Rappers had nothing on Punk Rockers. When I said before that the punkers were bad asses, I meant it. Especially Sid Vicious. I am not taking anything away from the current day rappers, but they had the punkers to copy from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Illuminati were real and were formed in the 20&#39;s-30&#39;s.
They had a 25-part rulebook written for them by their founder, Adam &gt;Weishaupt. You can read these rules and see how, after their &gt;conception, they started to take shape in American society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were real, alright, but not the first. </p>

<p>There is nothing new anymore. If you think that Hip Hop is the baddest thing to ever grace the planet, well, you are wrong. It was done before. Do some research and you will find that I am right. </p>

<p>The reason you view Hip Hop as the baddest thing is because you have nothing to compare it with, in your experience, which is understandable, but wrong.</p>

<p>Only to the the young ones. This thought pattern has been going on for decades or more. Yours is not the first to think like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The younger ones who grow up in this &quot;be a thug&quot; craze are not going to give a shit about older generations. I am trying to discuss what is going on now, not what happened before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be dismissive of other generations is arrogant. This is why one must be older then 35 to be President. If we had a young punk in charge of the Nukes, we would all be dead now. Arrogance is why a lot of the older generation looks down on the younger ones. All generations should learn from each other to make a better world, but that isn&#39;t about to happen anytime soon.</p>

People write songs about drinking and partying because it sells; it sells because more people can relate to simple concepts like that. Everyone can relate to a generic feel-good summer anthem. If the masses could relate to a rap song about nuclear fusion then the record labels would pump out rap songs about nuclear fusion. There&#39;s not some evil sinister corrupt plan behind it, unless that&#39;s how you define capitalism or supply and demand (some people probably do).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically enough most of the more fringe rap/hip-hop artists have re-claimed the genre by rapping about these very thing and its relation to mass control, Illuminati, etc. Check out Lupe Fiasco, he&#39;s one of the more famous rap artists that does a great job of trying to wake people up. Kendrick Lamar is another good example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep - they are definitely using pop music to glamorize moral decay.</p>

<p>A couple of points.</p>

<p>The interview where Katy Perry says she sold her soul to the devil is a hoax. Watch that part again and watch her lips. Someone dubbed that part. </p>

<p>This whole control of music goes back til at least the &#39;60s. Check Bob Dylan here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqvvOD4bdRs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqvvOD4bdRs</a> - </p>

<p>Also, you missed out a couple of people:</p>

<p>Nicky Minaj (says in interviews that she is possessed)</p>

<p>Kesha (so much use of Satanic imagery)</p>

<p>Miley Cyrus (she just became one of them recently)</p>

<p>One message that these artists like to put out there (along with the sex and drugs stuff) is &quot;we can do whatever we want&quot; - which is part of Anton Lavey&#39;s satanic philosophy... you&#39;ll notice this theme comes up a lot in pop music (most recently in the Miley Cyrus video for &#39;Can&#39;t Stop&#39;).</p>

<p>Great post - thanks. That pic of Beyonce in a Baphomet outfit... wow!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to have to agree with all the &quot;old-heads&quot; in here citing examples of debauchery and hooliganism in the music industry. 
They have the truth of it. Granted, you do have some good ideas and many things you&#39;ve said are true as far as I can see, but you are, in fact, entirely, 1000% wrong about this all starting with the hip-hop movement of the 80s-present. 
It even goes back past punk. 
The idea of punk was that the gov&#39;t was crud and they wanted to speak out against it. I highly doubt that punk was ever a controlled opposition. 
I would have to say this all started in the 1900s. 
Old blues and country musicians would talk about going out to the crossroad and selling their soul to the devil for musical prowress. 
After that along came jazz with its wildy dancing and unique subculture. You have to remember that back then jazz was looke down on. 
The flappers of the 1920s. The use of alcohol within speakeasies and the general use of heroin by jazz musicians. That&#39;s factual knowledge most jazz musicians of the 1920s-1970s used heroin. 
After jazz you have rock n roll. Thought to be &quot;the work of the devil&quot; by the mainly conservative American population of the 1950s. 
Rock n roll alongside jaz has always had a history deep-seated in sex, violence and drug use. 
Elvis Presley, constantly mocked and spoken about because of his &quot;provocative&quot; hip movements and gestures. He was a known drug addict. 
The Beatles, they spoke of drugs, the sang about drugs and sex(although this wasn&#39;t as blatant as it is today) &quot;Maxwell&#39;s Silver Hammer&quot; is blatantly about sex. It wasn&#39;t until their return from India that they had any new direction except &quot;write what was popular and meaningful to them&quot; 
This is when they became lee politically outspoken, Lennon specifically. 
What rock morphed in to only perpetuates the idea of this long existing defiling of the music we hold deal. 
Metal&#39;s arrival in the 70s-80s and punk in the 60s-80s both seeme to equally express violence and to some extent satanic worship. 
With the emergence of rap and hip-hop loosely based on the R&amp;B and straight Blues of old. These example of sex, drugs and violence became more and more frequent. 
We cannot simply sum this up to conspiracy alone. 
As a society we have allowed for the slow corruption of our values and morals. 
This idea has always been a part of bein human. 
Now in the twenty teens we have come to a new level of moral defiling. 
Children.. CHILDREN going around singing songs about sex acts. 
It is unfair however to say that this is some new idea expressed by only a few forms of music. It is also completely out of line to do so in such a manner as to be racially intolerant. 
As for your cited examples of musicians involved with this I must agree. Rihanna herself has even had examples in songs, citing &quot;S &amp; M&quot; as example with blatant wording calling herself &quot;princess of the illuminati&quot;</p>

<p>You cannot forget, however, that this could be a simple publicity stunt. In the past years conspiracy theory and the occult has become increasingly popular. For some odd reason musicians think its cool to say they sold their souls to the devil and all other terrible things. 
This could be an attempt to further the occult agenda or it could just be stupid rich people being stupid and trying to get publicity. 
Any publicity is good publicity right? Maybe they know this and they just want you to talk about them. Or maybe this is some 1000s of years old. Conquest of world domination. This has yet to be seen. 
Thank you though for your thought and insight. 
I would suggest trying to be more tolerant and doing further research in music before &quot;crying wolf&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing loads of &#39;soul searching&#39; lately, and I find it extremely interesting that the music industry keeps on using the Eye of Horus. From all of the information I&#39;ve collected recently, the pyramids were used to align with stars in the sky to channel energy to Earth; and the eye means using your third eye, or pineal gland, to get in touch with who you really are.</p>

<p>How I see it is we are energetic beings, and we all have a choice of where to exert this energy. We can use it to create something that would bring us joy, or we can have it be directed outside of ourselves. The money system is what is used to direct it, and the music industry plays a vital role in exercising this. <a href="http://youtu.be/2LT23ixDaJo">This</a> video infuriates me personally, the background is supposed to be &#39;psychedelic and peaceful&#39; when actually it is connecting multiple sentiments that don&#39;t even go together. Rihanna does not stand for peace or expanding your mind, it is quite the opposite. </p>

<p>So all I&#39;ve got so far is they have the truth in plain sight, the truth of enlightenment that can bring peace to this Earth - but only so they can control it. Instead of connecting an infinity symbol, the all seeing eye, or pyramids to what they REALLY mean, you will instantly think about our government or the mainstream entertainers. When you reach true enlightenment, you can not be controlled anymore. But if you are being told subliminally you are already enlightened through symbolism in music videos, you won&#39;t look any further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have come to the conclusion we do have an inherent energy about us. I am vague because I am not quite sure what it is but it is something. Our body is comprised of electrical currents that are manipulated through external stimuli. For example, when you have a &#39;reaction&#39; to a statement that someone says, what are you &#39;reacting&#39; to? I find it infinitely easier to persuade others in person opposed through text based communication. </p>

<p>On to the point of enlightenment. Can you elaborate? I feel my biggest fear in regards to be controlled is the subtle ones - commercials, lyrics in heavy bass songs, things that seem inconsequential upon initial inspection but serve a purpose through repetition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When we have reactions to people, body language and eye contact come in to play as to why we react differently in text than in person. I think you&#39;re onto something when it comes to energy exchange as well. You can usually tell if someone is angry (for example) not only by their facial expressions, but like an energy around them. It&#39;s really weird! </p>

<p>I&#39;m still gathering information to find a theory of our energy, but what I&#39;ve got so far is everything around us is made of energy, including us. Everything is made of atoms, we are made of atoms, even oxygen is made of atoms, so energetically, how could our thoughts exist with out exerting some kind of energy? Energy can not be created or destroyed, so that means it is being balanced some how. Being enlightened is to be able to balance the energy inside yourself (I believe, so far). There&#39;s much more I want to try to explain, but it would take loads of text and I&#39;m not completely sure yet how it all could function if it&#39;s true. </p>

<p>You&#39;re spot on with repetition, it is exactly what is used to control. We as human beings adapt to our environments, our surroundings tell us how to survive in where we reside. If we&#39;re being shown super skinny people with plastic surgery, or seeing a product consistent through out everything we view, or see people acting a certain way consistently, we are being trained; the reason I say &#39;trained&#39; is because our media and entertainment provides a controlled environment. </p>

<p>With heavy bass in songs, that is intriguing to think about - you should look into binaural beats. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve started using recently, and I could see that being used for association... man that&#39;s creepy. </p>

<p>When you reach enlightenment, you realize your power. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m quite there yet, but with as far as I&#39;ve gotten you don&#39;t put as much emphasis on your ego. Your ego is still there, it&#39;s part of being human, but you can shape it to how YOU want to function. In our society, people are told to view each other as rigid. This person acts this way, so that means they are probably [insert stereotype or judgment here]. Structurally, how you view the world is also how you view yourself; so if you catch yourself acting a certain way, let&#39;s say questioning authority, you&#39;d be inclined to stop your thinking and label yourself as something. That blocks any kind of progress, it&#39;s denying yourself of expansion. The train of thought gets stopped in it&#39;s tracks with that judgment, and then you start thinking about something else.</p>

<p>I have learned you truly can be who you want to be, but it takes hard work. You have to really want it, unconditionally love yourself, learn to realize that &#39;failure&#39; is not real.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry this is so freakin long! lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good luck on your journey! As I recommended above, Rudolf Steiner attempted to get esoteric knowledge public during the 1900s, and wrote a great many works on the path of initiation and enlightenment. </p>

<p>I also urge everyone to be more wary of their ego. A lot of us have lived our lives thus far led around in circles by our ego, which is extremely vulnerable to influence and manipulation. Do not be afraid to let go completely of just <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> you think you are in this physical reality, as well as the lies that we have been told for millennia about what it really means to be human.</p>

<p>Whats funny is that you can see the progression of an artist. The first album, maybe the 2nd are the artist expressing themselves. Slowly but surely their sons turn materialistic and pompus, and then near the time they fall from grace or die, the &quot;getting out&quot; vibe is strong in their albums.</p>

<p>Song writers DO have some leverage over what goes into their music. that leverage slips as they continue their lifestyle of money, fame and complete disconnection from reality. For example:</p>

<hr/>

<p>*Maybe 10/12 songs on the album the artist had complete control. Next ablum, theyre a little bigger a little more famous. New contracts say only controlling of say, 6 of the 12 songs. Third album, 3 songs, etc etc *</p>

<p>The artists at first are picky with their music, but as time goes by theyre more willing to hand over creativity to some writer so they can live their grand lifestyle. I mean, who needs to write music when youre nikki manaj or lady gaga?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Just my deduction on the music industry, i actually know little to none of the nuts and bolts of it. Im not really that into music to start with anyways. i try to form my opinions to fit reality (no shadow men coaxing the stars to do what they say), and the facts i see and am able to deduct; so dont hold anything i said against me if im blatantly wrong </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Illuminati is fake.</p>

<p>The record industry is a part of the corporate media industry and illuminati is more of a red herring distraction.</p>

<p>Hollywood and the media industry is very Jewish. The US is traditionally mostly Christian but they&#39;ve been getting less relevant over the last few decades.</p>

<p>The US uses a 2 party system and the right is very traditional pro Christian/Capitalists. The left is a collective of minority groups and supporters. Jewish people typically fit in this side. Communists too.</p>

<p>Judaism &amp; Christianity are 2 of the 3 major Abrahamic religions. Islam is the third. Jewish people aren&#39;t super big fans of the Christians and this tends to come out in the media.</p>

<p>All that illuminati stuff is mostly just Jewish directors &amp; writers messing with Christians by inserting vague symbolism and using people&#39;s reactions to help sell the artist through false controversy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a way to sell product.</p>

<p>White kids like rebelling, black culture, and sinning.</p>

<p>In the 40&#39;s, the US government accused Hollywood of trying to force communist ideals on American teenagers through subversive programming. Right wing Christian prosecutors had tribunals and blacklisted a bunch of Hollywood bigwigs.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Hollywood ever stopped holding a grudge because after that, the US political spectrum started leaning a lot further left.</p>

<p>White kids discovered Jazz, black culture, and weed.</p>

<p>Hollywood has been using black people for decades.</p>

<p>Kids are natural rebels. You grow up being told what to do, you eventually get sick of it. Hollywood uses this to their advantage by making music rebellious.</p>

<p>Anything that is deemed sinful by Christian idiots is made popular by left wing media.</p>

<p>Jazz introduced white kids to bohemian counter culture attitudes. Drugs, sex, dancing, music, became more engrained in to youth culture and this kept evolving.</p>

<p>The original hipsters were just kids in the 40&#39;s going to &#39;black&#39; clubs and getting high and partying.</p>

<p>Rock &amp; Roll is black music. The industry steals music from black artists, then repackages it for white kids. Boy Bands for example are derivative of R&amp;B groups from the 80&#39;s.</p>

<p>Kids being rebels, they have a tendency to turn on the industry some times which creates all new types of music.</p>

<p>People get sick of what the radio plays so they reject it and find or make new music. Punk, Heavy Metal, Hip Hop, are all types of rebel music and they all formed naturally, in the streets by fans.</p>

<p>In the early 90&#39;s, the record labels saw the rise of these genres and saw their profits slipping, so they signed of the artists and made them crazy popular.</p>

<p>Nirvana for example started the Grunge phase. before Nirvana came out big, they were a just another average punk influenced band trying to release albums.</p>

<p>What this did though was make it acceptable for punk bands to &#39;sell out&#39;. Next thing you know Bad Religion has their entire Epitaph line up hitting MTV and riding the corporate adoption of skateboarding via Tony Hawk&#39;s pro skater, the X games, and the Warped Tour.</p>

<p>Punk rock got taken over by corporate weasels who downplayed the anti-corporate attitudes and turned it into just another trend.</p>

<p>Hip Hop went the same way too.</p>

<p>Early old school hip hop was filled with social commentary and criticized the ghetto and the way black people got treated.</p>

<p>About the same time punk rock was getting screwed, the labels were doing the same thing to rap artists, particularly bands like Public Enemy who were highly political. </p>

<p>They fired PE and after NWA broke up, Dre &amp; Ice Cube signed with the major labels and started selling music that glorified ghetto culture instead of criticizing it.</p>

<p>The music changed and fans started listening to the new hip hop that was more fun, less serious, and more focused on partying.</p>

<p>Artists after that had less substance to their lyrics and instead of criticizing the government, it turned to shallow bragging about making money and smoking weed and shooting guns and driving around in fancy cars with hot women.</p>

<p>Gangs were a problem in the hood like 30 years ago. The war on drugs is a racket that makes money off ignorant black kids getting in to trouble and winding up in prison. There&#39;s a bunch of companies that make huge profits off prison services and tax-payers end up footing the bill.</p>

<p>The media tricked black people in to adopting the negative idealisms laced in the music and it really fucked with black communities by forcing ignorance on young listeners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest fallacy in this whole argument (not just you OP, but everyone who subscribes to this &quot;Illuminati in rap&quot; theory) is that just because someone uses &quot;Illuminati&quot; symbolism, or what the online masses have associated as Illuminati symbolism from whoknowswhere, means they&#39;re in the &quot;Illuminati.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Take Jay-Z for example. His story is pretty generic for a rapper - grow up in the streets around drugs, a rags to riches transformation later, and he&#39;s making legitimate money selling records. Except, I would contend, that Jay is a genius visionary businessman.  I think he&#39;s a big nerd that was fascinated by the &quot;Illuminati&quot; legend growing up, like we are, and incorporated the imagery as a metaphor for his success. Self-fulfilling prophecy, he tells people he&#39;s all powerful and insinuates some level of manipulation or mind control ability, people buy a bunch of his records, and essentially that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. People idolize Jay and decide that anything he does is cool, now he&#39;s essentially controlling the public, or a large part. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that he has an Illuminati Club membership card in his wallet and attends the monthly meetings, but I think he&#39;s a member of a informal group of people trying to sell products to the public and does a good job of it. </p>
