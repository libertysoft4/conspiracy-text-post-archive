        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> is the most viewed non-default subreddit with 855,165 readers. Their current subreddit style now has multiple &#39;submit&#39; buttons, and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9LfQWvi.png">the top one is specifically for &quot;nsa/prism/snowden&quot; articles.</a> That submit link actually redirects the submitter to a different, <em>much smaller</em> (11,888 readers) and relatively unused subreddit that they also control called <a href="/r/inthenews">/r/inthenews</a>. They clearly <em>don&#39;t want</em> their massive audience to be aware of developments on the NSA spying story.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/about/moderators">/r/news</a> just so happens to share <em>two</em> moderators with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/about/moderators">/r/RestoreTheFourth.</a></p>

<p>On their website <a href="http://www.restorethefourth.net/faq/">restorethefourth.net</a> they bizarrely attribute <em>everything</em> published about the ongoing and still developing spying revelations story to the <em>Washington Post</em> while not even mentioning <em>The Guardian</em>... when in fact the <em>WaPo</em> reporter went immediately to unnamed &quot;government officials&quot; after being contacted by Snowden. Upon them telling Snowden that they did this he replied: <em>“I regret that we weren’t able to keep this project unilateral”</em>, and from then on he worked exclusively with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-nsa-files"><em>The Guardian</em> and investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald.</a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/06/how-washington-post-lost-prism-exclusive/66048/">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/06/how-washington-post-lost-prism-exclusive/66048/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, why would the leadership of &quot;RestoreTheFourth&quot; mislead people into thinking that the <em>WaPo</em> is to be fully credited with the scoop? Because the <em>WaPo</em> <del>is controlled by</del> kowtows to the intel agencies spying on everyone, and apparently so does the goatse-themed &quot;protest&quot; movement and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great work. This is the third post I&#39;ve seen which has made me quite suspicious of the mods who seem to control <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/restorethefourth">/r/restorethefourth</a>.</p>

<p>I believe the first post I saw was a picture where <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> changed their header to something like &quot;TIL <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> stands for News.About.Edward.Snowden&quot;. That raised my eyebrows, but the second post I saw on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regarding the asshole/goatse symbol in the restorethefourth movement really raised red flags.</p>

<p>Not to mention the abhorrent level of censorship in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> surronding this very topic-<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1hb7bk/restore_the_fourth_group_organizes_nationwide/casrb25?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1hb7bk/restore_the_fourth_group_organizes_nationwide/casrb25?context=3</a></p>

<p>And then you can watch bipolearbear0 respond <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1hih9k/rally_to_restore_your_rights_on_july_4th/caut5lu">here</a> to criticisms regarding the logo and the censorship only to appear even more the fool. </p>

<p>But yeah, he&#39;s shady as fuck...  I tried to tell r/restoretgefourth that they might not want BipolarBear0 associated with the rt4 movement based on his weird porn habits that are easily discovered with a google search...(not that porn is bad, but the whole guilty by association effect it might have on the movement).  Nobody cared at first, but then he stepped down as a moderator on r/dickgirls and I think he might have stepped down from r/childgrape.</p>

<p>At one point Bipolarbear0&#39;s &quot;lover&quot; showed up in a conversation defending him and his actions.  Even his whole, &quot;I&#39;m going to infiltrate r/conspiracy to try to find racists&quot; deal.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a vague rule about post about stories that already have a lot of recent submissions. The sidebar doesn&#39;t give more detail because it won&#39;t get read if there is too much. I&#39;ve been planning to make a more detailed version of the rules in the wiki that the sidebar would link to, but haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet, the main reason being my work with Rt4.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t make a vague rule,  make a post about the five story rule to make sure people know about it...or are you scared of the reaction you&#39;d get? Well seeing as you bow to the pressure of angry mod messages supposedly coming from people who want less Snowden stories, maybe you&#39;ll wield to those angry mod messages who want the community to be able to decide what it can vote on.</p>

<p>The link seems like a suggestion if only to promote <a href="/r/inthenews">/r/inthenews</a> (who <a href="/u/douglasmacarthur">/u/douglasmacarthur</a> also runs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was actually originally there to promote <a href="/r/r4links">/r/r4links</a> but another mod didnt like that so I switched it to <a href="/r/inthenews">/r/inthenews</a> because it was faster than removing it completely.</p>

<p>However this left us with a big empty space between two of the submit buttons that shouldn&#39;t be there. We should fix that already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive me, but he says that his father did. He doesn&#39;t say he doesn&#39;t, at least, not there. </p>

<p>Science suggests a strong genetic contribution for bipolar, at least to predisposition. And really, all of these &quot;disorders&quot; are magical groups of typical human characteristics on a sliding scale. If his father was, I&#39;d give him greater than even odds of at least having some characteristics.</p>

They have a nearly infinite and unstoppable reach on our internet. Just think about it, if you wanted to stop people stop taking away your legitimacy and power And you had the means to do it, why the hell wouldn&#39;t you?</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here... Well more of make an educated guess, that the NSA and the rest of the government is capable of and is willing to fix any news sharing site if they think it poses them a threat. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit... It&#39;s all accessible to them. </p>

<p>The worst part? PEOPLE DON&#39;T GIVE 2 FUCKS. Sure they might give one and bitch on the Internet, but that&#39;s not gonna do shit. I mean hell, I&#39;m doing it now, but am I gonna go out tomorrow and gather a crowd to rally in the streets like we are taught to do? Fuck that, I don&#39;t want to be on every watch list. I have people I care about and I don&#39;t want to put them in harms way. </p>

<p>The internet in it&#39;s entirety was created for you, to intentionally let media and or the spread of information fall into your hands.</p>

<p>The timing was perfect, by the time 95 rolled around they had it all mapped out, by 97 it was being implemented. Your tech world was created to be used against you. </p>

<p>All the world is , is huge credit scam that has a shelf life, thy run it for as long as they can, usually about 150 years to a 100 years and then they need to burnit down, hide for awhile then pop back up and do it again...</p>
