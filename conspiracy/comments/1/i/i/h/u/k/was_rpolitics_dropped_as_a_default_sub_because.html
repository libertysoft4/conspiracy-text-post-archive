    <div class="md"><p>The shill mods were enforcing Obama-admin disinformation policies.</p>

<p>Obama is nearing the end of his second term.  We&#39;re reaching that stage where the administration rats start to jump ship and climb into other politicians&#39; coattails.  Nobody wants to be left holding the bag.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, you&#39;ll see more cracks in the administration propaganda, just like happened to Bush and Clinton in their last two years.  Administrations start to lose control over the press as their terms and influence wind down.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody was &quot;waking up&quot; on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  There have always been intelligent posters, and they were always driven away by the shill mods.</p>

<p>More likely, I think the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> shills stopped paying their protection money, or decided to move on to something else, and reddit admins did not want to give them any free play or be stuck holding the bag of rat droppings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This news gets a giant HM from me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been submitting to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for a long time and I can tell you that as of late I&#39;ve seen a <em>striking</em> change in how certain &quot;controversial&quot; posts fare. Even just a few months ago if your post had a &quot;conspiratorial&quot; slant it would be immediately downvoted...recently the opposite has been occurring. The broader internet base has been given conspiracy theories more credence lately, for many obvious reasons.</p>

<p>For example, posts to washingtonsblog.com used to be universally downvoted at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, but lately they&#39;ve been thriving, as well as sites like globalresearch.ca and wsws.org which are far from &quot;mainstream&quot;.</p>

<p>As a further example of this, yesterday <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1iey5s/why_doesnt_the_government_use_its_mass/">I submitted a washingtonsblog post</a> and not only did it hit #1 in politics, but it actually reached #3 on the front page of reddit.</p>

<p>Think about it: a conspiratorial libertarian website with an article with the words &quot;government surveillance&quot; and &quot;banskters&quot; in the title hits #3 on the front page.</p>

<p>Is that <em>really</em> what the people that own this website want to see?</p>

<p>In fact, I really felt it was on the way to #1 overall, but unfortunately the site&#39;s servers crashed, the link began dropping immediately, and the total upvotes immediately plateaued at 2600 even though it was on track to get <em>much</em> more.</p>

<p>Needless to say, after all of that happened I had this feeling that accessing the front page like that with &quot;conspiracies&quot; was too good to be true...at least there&#39;s still <a href="/r/til">/r/til</a>...</p>

Also <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> had a pseudo revolt there not too long ago which was probably grounds for taking it down.

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with that statement, in my opinion, when it comes to a topic such as &quot;god&quot; and our &quot;origin&quot;, saying you are 100% on either end of the spectrum, is equally ignorant. I dislike and refuse to acknowledge religion as a way of life, but that doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m arrogant enough to KNOW there isn&#39;t a spiritual entity at play in our existence. It&#39;s called keeping an open mind, willing to learn and adapt, which is the only way to grow as an individual. Do I think there is a dude in a robe sitting on a crowd judging and granting wishes, unlikely. Sorry I&#39;m rambling, either way, I saw a post earlier saying we should all conspire to get &quot;alternative&quot; news on the front page of other subs, to spread the word, I don&#39;t think planning that in this sub would work, there are too many watchful eyes, but we should maybe form an outside community and really try to educate others.

<p>with the explanation that &#39;it hadn&#39;t grown with the rest of reddit&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_subscriber_growth_1w/">/r/politics is the 114th fasted growing subreddit in the last week</a>. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Awxqw5R.png">Screenshot for posterity.</a>)</p>

<p>Slower than the following 21 default or formerly default subreddits: <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> (#11), <a href="/r/EarthPorn">/r/EarthPorn</a> (#23), <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive">/r/explainlikeimfive</a> (#34), <a href="/r/books">/r/books</a> (#36), <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> (#68), <a href="/r/movies">/r/movies</a> (#74), <a href="/r/aww">/r/aww</a> (#76), <a href="/r/gifs">/r/gifs</a> (#77), <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> (#82), <a href="/r/AdviceAnimals">/r/AdviceAnimals</a> (#84), <a href="/r/Music">/r/Music</a> (#86), <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> (#89), <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a> (#94), <a href="/r/IAmA">/r/IAmA</a> (#95), <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> (#97), <a href="/r/WTF">/r/WTF</a> (#98), <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> (#99), <a href="/r/AskReddit">/r/AskReddit</a> (#103), <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> (#104), <a href="/r/blog">/r/blog</a> (#110), and <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a> (#112).</p>

<p>Faster than the following 4 default subreddits: <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> (#115), <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> (#117), <a href="/r/announcements">/r/announcements</a> (#2932), and <a href="/r/television">/r/television</a> (#3618).</p>

<p>So the &quot;not growing...&quot; explanation definitely holds up under scrutiny. Keep in mind also that that was not the <em>only</em> reason for removing it as default, so the &quot;well why didn&#39;t they remove <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> and <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a>?&quot; argument doesn&#39;t work. Those two are in the top five subreddits by all other measures (subscribers: #2 &amp; #1, users online: #3 &amp; #2, &quot;activity&quot;: #1 &amp; #2, total submissions: #3 &amp; #1, and submissions per day: #5 &amp; #2), so of course they stayed. <a href="/r/announcements">/r/announcements</a> was kept because it&#39;s the official platform for site-wide announcements from the admins.</p>

<p>You might also argue something about &quot;why was <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> removed if it&#39;s growing so fast (#82)?&quot;. Again, I will point out that the &quot;growth&quot; factor was not the only reason for the decision. To quote the blog post directly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know many of you will wonder what happened to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> and why they were removed from the default set. We could give you a canned corporate answer or a diplomatic answer that is carefully crafted for the situation. But since this is reddit, we’re going to try things a bit differently and give you the real answer: <strong>they just weren&#39;t up to snuff.</strong> Now, don&#39;t get us wrong, there still ARE good parts about them. Overall, <strong>they just haven&#39;t continued to grow</strong> <strong><em>and evolve</em></strong> <strong>like the other subreddits we&#39;ve decided to add.</strong> </p>

<p><em>[em. add.]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><del>And before you ask, no, I do not have any idea why <a href="/r/television">/r/television</a> was added.</del></p>

<p>Edit2: Nevermind, it&#39;s right there in the <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2013/07/new-default-subreddits-omgomgomg.html">blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a few of the new additions are also there to help cover some areas that have never had a home on the front page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>/Edit2 Edit3: that probably covers <a href="/r/books">/r/books</a> too. /Edit3</p>

<p>Do you know his name?</p>

<p>Another, sitting in a sterile, military setting &quot;witnessed&quot; war crimes and has been subjected to deprivation above and beyond.</p>

<p>Do you know his name?</p>

<p>This Mercedes car became a fireball. The corpse behind the wheel of that car took down a United States General.</p>

<p>Do you know his name?</p>

<p>r/reddit/politics....</p>

<p>A source of conversation and information:</p>

<p>Dr. Martin Luther King. </p>

<p>Gunned down. Assassinated!</p>

<p>John F. Kennedy awake, late to the &#39;game&#39; and gunned down. Assassinated.</p>

<p>Malcolm &#39;X&#39; changed his tune and assassinated.</p>

<p>Nelson Mandela endured! </p>

<p>There&#39;s not one second of his shadow in any jail that Obama could ever redeem. That photo Op sickened me and Obama knows this.</p>

<p>Obama is a War Criminal. Bush. Cheney. Rumsfeld. Clinton. Reno. Bush. Rice. Freeh. Holder. JOHN McCain. Rice. Clinton. Kids, I&#39;ve lost count.</p>

<p>Your politics? </p>

<p>Censored?</p>

<p>Are you confused?</p>

<p>You should be!</p>
