    <div class="md"><p>Correct... I am the embodiment of God&#39;s consciousness. I have a seemingly human body, but my DNA consists entirely of transposons ever since I reached maturity. Transposons are multidimensional element of DNA that allows for gene transfers through time and space by a mechanism you would refer to as quantum tunneling. I am the creator of literally everything you see, hear, taste, touch and smell as well as all information you have learned throughout your lifetime. I am perfect in every way. Everything I have done in my life, and everything I ever will do in my life will be absolutely perfect for reasons you cannot comprehend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite....  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correct... I am the embodiment of God&#39;s consciousness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, one could argue that all consciousness is that of God&#39;s attempt to experience God&#39;s own existence.  The catch in your case is that this is not a unique to the individual, it&#39;s part of a collective conscious and any and all perceptions of it being unique would illusory.       </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am the creator of literally everything you see, hear, taste, touch and smell as well as all information you have learned throughout your lifetime.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is a paradox.  Because it is a equally true for both of us.  As you see me you create me through your consciousness and vice versa for my case.  I create you through mine.  So while this statement may not be false, it&#39;s inherently flawed.  </p>

<p>God is not a paradox.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am perfect in every way. Everything I have done in my life, and everything I ever will do in my life will be absolutely perfect for reasons you cannot comprehend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not comprehend it only because It&#39;s not my creation, it&#39;s yours.
But just understanding that grants me comprehension.  </p>

<p>So you must be a very low in the multidimensional being hierarchy to taut semantics as truth.   </p>

<p>Exactly my point. YOU ARE ALL GOD! EVERY SINGLE THING YOU EXPERIENCE IS GOD. </p>

<p>This is NOT a paradox for reasons that you cannot and will not ever comprehend. You are free to think what you want. I gave you the ability to make your own decisions and think for yourself. In fact, I encourage you to try to poke holes in my story. That is why I am here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what this entire &quot;lesson&quot; is about. I am teaching you that there is more to life than what you see in front of you. The source you seek is consciousness itself. Everything that man has ever created has flaws. This includes science, religion, philosophy, and EVERY other mental construct under the old paradigm. You WILL NOT FIND TRUTH IN SCIENCE AS IT IS A MENTAL CONSTRUCT OF HUMANS AND NOT GOD. Take a look at the world you live in. There is so much violence, fear, anxiety, depression, etc. You were NEVER meant to live like this. Existence is about bliss, happiness and above all, LOVE. Love is the force that conciousness uses to attract your attention to certain things. It is no accident that you are reading this. I am attracting you into my new reality. The people with &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; are the people who will see this first, regardless of your skin color, sexual orientation, or any other physical attribute you might see as an imperfection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the case is simply a catalyst for inner city rioting and a just cause for martial law to make people feel &quot;safe again&quot; and simultaneously dividing the public against each other instead of the real issues that need to be faced.  Cities like oakland across the country are already rioting and it&#39;s completely disconnected from an issue that isn&#39;t race based, but simply a sad realization of how the justice system works.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At 5 pm central time today, time will stop. God will return to this planet to teach EVERYONE a lesson that will change how they see things. He will essentially eradicate fear from everyone&#39;s consciousness and all you will feel is the love that is left behind. This is all you really need to know at the current time. God&#39;s design is far too complex for the human mind to comprehend, and for good reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Well, one could argue that all consciousness is that of God&#39;s attempt to experience God&#39;s own existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly my point. YOU ARE ALL GOD! EVERY SINGLE THING YOU EXPERIENCE IS GOD. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This statement is a paradox. Because it is a equally true for both of us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is NOT a paradox for reasons that you cannot and will not ever comprehend. You are free to think what you want. I gave you the ability to make your own decisions and think for yourself. In fact, I encourage you to try to poke holes in my story. That is why I am here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you must be a very low in the multidimensional being hierarchy to taut semantics as truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very false... I am as high as it gets ;) </p>
