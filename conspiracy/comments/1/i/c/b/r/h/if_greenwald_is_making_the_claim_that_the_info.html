If Snowden would release proof that 9/11 was committed by Al Quaeda without knowledge from the US, all the 9/11 truthers would dismiss him as disinfo agent and come up with wild theories how we were all duped for months into believing he was the real deal while in fact he was CIA all along. </p>

<p>Snowden has &quot;leaked&quot; nothing that hasn&#39;t been known for years. The only thing he leaked were operational details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually like how they have go about slowly leaking the information.  If they dropped it all at ounce, the media will just pick a few aspects and run with just that.  Now, they have to focus just on the info provided.  Also, it shows how the government story has to change with every new additional piece of information leaked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is to go around the media. The media is a propaganda arm. They will ignore anything that is counter to the current agenda anyway. This information needs to be released to the public and a grass roots social media campaign needs to be enacted wherein the information is shared as widely as possible. From grandma/grandpa email blasts to facebook shares and reddit posts. The public is perfectly capable of exploiting the new channels of media and has no need to be spon fed leaks via the &quot;Mainstream media&quot;.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I think its high time that we start exposing pedophilia and human trafficking in high places. In my estimation, the visceral element of the crimes coupled with the high-profile personalities committing the crimes will be what it takes to get people off their asses and doing something. The Franklin Scandal is one of many such incidences in the States:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">Franklin Scandal Wikipedia</a>
<a href="http://franklinscandal.com/">Nick Bryant&#39;s Website, ad-heavy but has info</a>
<a href="http://www.thiscantbehappening.net/node/1315">Yet another article</a></p>

<p>What is more, we need to start showing the links between church based pedophilia and politicians. We are looking at a network of powerful pedos, people have painted all catholic priests with the pedo brush, while ignoring that the priests that are having their crimes covered up have connections to political and financial elites throughout the country. </p>

<p>In any event, leaking the Snowden information out slowly only serves the power elite. It allows PR campaigns to pre-emptively frame and dismiss allegations. It allows counter-propaganda techniques to be deployed in front of meaningful releases. It allows the entire debate to be framed by the gatekeepers, who &quot;judiciously&quot; determine what we hoi polloi should know at any given moment.</p>

<p>If there are crimes being committed and rights being trampled, I want to know in full. I don&#39;t want Glenn Greewnald to determine when an appropriate time to release the information is.</p>

<p>It a double edge sword, they can either just wash everything out by overloading the media to much information, so they can cherry pick the least damning information, or they can slowly leak it out.  As for Gleen Greenwald, I personally don&#39;t have a problem with how he has been conducting this situation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more. If we are to evolve into a global species than children must be priority number one. </p>

<p>Note: when actually looking at the worlds problems with open eyes Children are actually at the center of all our problems. Psychologically, Anthropologically, Moralistically. Always at the center. Of course I am not referring to the saber rattling rhetoric where the topic of Child Safety is paraded like a dead carcass amongst political Hyenas. I mean quite literally.</p>

<p>If you were of the mind to cause trouble or fix things children would be the logical place to start so should be to begin. I draw my conclusions from history. </p>

<p>Thank you brizzadizza for this point of view on this subject. </p>

Anything else and americans will bend over and take it.

<ol>
<li><p>Proof the government is going to fuck everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Proof the government has information that reveals everyone is going to get fucked and is compliant in it happening.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You could insert almost anything into those two categories and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. Lets see: aliens, fabricated wars/genocide, NWO, state sponsored terrorism, global threats of natural origin, you name it. </p>

<p>I do believe we&#39;ll know soon enough. Thoughts take actions that give rise to actions. I don&#39;t think the lid can stay on something like this.</p>

<p>As an alternative narrative, it could also be part of a psyop/disinfo campaign. Maybe snowden will ultimately die. Maybe a drone strike. Maybe this is all to set a new legal precedence for institutionalized tyranny. That&#39;s all also plausible in my mind.</p>
