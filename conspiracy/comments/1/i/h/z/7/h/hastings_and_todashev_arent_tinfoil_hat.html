Reddit offers a distinct advantage to those of us brave enough to consider what&#39;s actually happening to the world around us. While corporate mainstream media is subject to the claws of the US Stasi apparatus, social media is subject to crowd appeal. I propose a simple method of injecting these stories into the mainstream subs that all users have default access to. </p>

<p>When a story is posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, put an x-post to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> into the comments, if we can all start the ball rolling on exposing some of these travesties to the mass public, than the stories have a real chance of inspiring real public outcry.  </p>

<p>If you guys have some ideas as to how we can accomplish this task, injecting these stories into mainstream media, than please discuss. I for one would be willing to participate in any means necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I had an idea for a sub today. It&#39;s a known fact that there are users on this site promoting a social agenda. <a href="/r/SocialAgenda">/r/SocialAgenda</a> or something to that effect - could be a sub devoted to listing users suspected of pursuing a paid agenda. We could compile lists for various agendas and the users associated with them. The users listed could potentially defend themselves from accusation, and it would be left up to the readership to pass judgement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you suggesting we work behind the scenes in secret to push our agenda? sounds like a conspiracy ;)</p>

<p>This seems like a fairly good idea, vote rigging is an issue. even if the language is hazy, thats a double edged sword and even worse, it could be bent to either extreme.</p>

<p>However, if we all were to decide to start/continue to browse r/politics and independently upvote particular articles....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a long list of bull shit, we&#39;re all aware of it on this sub. I&#39;m asking you guys how we&#39;re going to get this bullshit into the mainstream media. I feel like the legitimacy of these stories is lost when posted next to, &quot;corporate ass-licking patsy for big business with a profoundly anti-democratic contempt for due process and international law.&quot; True as it may be. We need to inject these stories in a more palatable form to the mainstream news feeds.  </p>

<p>Look at the top posts in this sub - over 2k of upvotes. We have the people power to get those posts to the top of default subs where the entirety of reddit will be forced to consider what they seem so willing to brush off.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an uphill fight. The current lack of exposure on mainstream subreddits does not result only from indifference of ordinary redditors. People who want to suppress this type of story have gained positions as moderators. They aggressively police the new page. They have their own subreddits from which they can summon downvote brigades. And the administrators implicitly support their actions.</p>

<p>Good luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah there. I looked into the TOS about vote rigging, truthfully I gave it a skim, and it seems that what we&#39;re talking about here is defined pretty hazily. I don&#39;t think it would constitute a violation of the TOS to x-post from our threads in this sub to the default subs in an effort to drive the content into a more public domain. Then again, the TOS language regarding such activity seems to be intentionally left subject to interpretation. In effect, we&#39;ll never know if we don&#39;t successfully try, and fail. </p>
