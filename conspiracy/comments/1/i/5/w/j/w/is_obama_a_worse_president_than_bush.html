    <div class="md"><p>On a certain level I agree that they are too similar, but part of the reason that the antiwar movement died down is that Obama hasn&#39;t started any new wars. Certainly his conduct of the current wars has been, IMO, appalling and possibly illegal. He didn&#39;t really mean change. However, Bush&#39;s administration lead us to invade a sovereign nation that was not resisting our requests.</p>

<p>Perhaps Obama would have done the same in a similar situation, but with just the facts on the ground, I think Bush will stand out in history as an especially bad administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much this. Bush created all these fucked up programs in response to 9/11 because he was an idiot and the people screamed for it. Than Obama comes along, promises change, peace, hope and all this other bullshit; mystifies people by being black, and putting up a good front.</p>

<p>Then he fucks up by not only <em>continuing</em> Bush&#39;s shit-tier programs, but goes ape-shit crazy with Executive Orders, creates more shit-tier programs, and has continued to hide things from the People making everything come across like he is conspiring to eliminate us.</p>

<p>At least Bush owned up to being an idiot that only cared about oil. I really have no idea what Obama&#39;s agendas are expect reforming the country into something that is against our Constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Along with that, he created a disinformation / propaganda system that the Republicans could only dream of.  Bush had the Limbaugh / Hannity crowd, but they were sort of isolated and fervent.</p>

<p>Obama has created shill teams (<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>) to create false perception across the mainstream media, social media, and so forth.  And the next Dem-Republican we elect is going to inherit all that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, many people are still patting themselves on the back very publicly for electing Obama.  Nobody boasted about voting for Bush in public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. It blows my mind. I&#39;m pretty sure he has the full fucking backing of African-Americans, Hispanics, and anyone under the poverty line. All they can think about is &quot;ooooah free benefits&quot; while remaining uneducated about all the shit he has pulled in the past 5 years. If not him, his administration. I&#39;m not racist or ignorant, but I swear the fact that he is of a different skin color is what caused such a stir and helped him get elected. People think it overrides everything bad he has done and that it helps unify America because he comes from a background and has a different skin color.</p>

<p>I am placing bets our next president will be the one who dismantles all this shit and restores parts of the Constitution back into our country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing--I think that they are about equally as terrible and evil; at least Bush came out and said &quot;OK, we&#39;re gonna do this evil shit, and if you&#39;re not with <em>us</em> you&#39;re with the <em>terrorists!</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Obama just says &quot;oh, don&#39;t worry, no evil shit here!&quot; and goes ahead and does it anyhow--then blames the fact that he did it on a Republican congress (which DOES have some base in actual fact--but that&#39;s another story). It HAS gotten to the point though that if you say this to an Obama supporter their usual rejonder is &quot;...think of what would have happened if RMoney was running the country!&quot;--which is just more support of the false left-right paradigm.</p>

<p>All I know is that, between the two of them, America has been utterly stripped of the things that once made her the greatest country in the world.</p>

I remember feeling happy, that America was about to reign down with the smite of a thousand gods and send these fuckwads to play with 77 virgins.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Bush at least had a spine and seemed sincere in his conviction. And he created programs like No Child Left Behind and did a lot of good in Africa that goes unsung. The WMD fiasco was exonerated by Wikileaks - look it up. And I say this as someone who deeply opposes the &quot;Patriot&quot; Act. Obama and his administration has consistently lied to the people, dwarfed the Patriot Act, and has exhibited extreme naiveté towards (or is sympathetic towards) radical islamists. So, yeah.</p>
