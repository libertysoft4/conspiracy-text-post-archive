    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the whole &quot;oh they&#39;re just letting it go through as a distraction&quot; thing is kind of absurd, given that this is the result of ~11 years of slow progress on M/MJ legalization.</p>

<p>Not to mention that almost none of the legalization efforts have anything to do with government, and are driven almost entirely by voter initiatives at the state level.</p>

<p>The other thing is that it&#39;s not even a <em>good</em> distraction. People see the news, and if they aren&#39;t some sort of frothing-at-the-mouth drug war psychopath, they go &quot;Oh, that&#39;s good.&quot; and simply move on. It&#39;s also not focused heavily in the media, aside from the same sort of cursory glance that I mention people give above, where maybe they mention it, or do a small news segment on it, then it just drops off the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>No, real distractions are those that last weeks, get tons of people on all sides of the political spectrum expending effort discussing the issue, as well as media <em>plastering it all over the place</em> for weeks on end. <em>Those</em> are the distractions, not this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullllllshit. Check out what&#39;s happening in MA. Since weed&#39;s been decriminalized, there&#39;s also been a HUGE uptake in opiate addiction and the subsequent treatment. I can&#39;t get Mass Health to cover dental care, but if I&#39;m on methadone, I could catch a daily taxi to the clinic?! Heroin is cheaper than pot here and it&#39;s grown locally! This much heroin and Oxy use isn&#39;t driven by the &quot;black market&quot;. This is government funded addiction, even pregnant women get the damn Seboxone. It&#39;s a generational euthanasia, I know several of the dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen, like didn&#39;t we all learn FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS to be a reliable source, historically? Now everyone claims bias or &quot;eye witness accounts&quot; as unreliable. Isn&#39;t the WHOLE POINT of the internet to be crowdsourcing, not just about &quot;publication facts&quot;? </p>

<p>I think the downvotes are from Potheads, personally. I smoked pot for over 15 years of my 33 years on this planet. Want PROOF that pot&#39;s a demotivator? When I was clean &amp; sober, I used to not only paint my nails, but my toenails. When I smoke pot, I don&#39;t even TRIM MY NAILS, my feet look like Bilbo&#39;s... </p>

<p>Anytime I speak from a Recovery standpoint (or Religious), I get downvoted. Funny how you all think pot makes you some great dissenter. IF EVERYONE IS SMOKING POT these days, how are you not part of the &quot;herd&quot;? Many of you ARE not using it medicinally or for spiritual practice, you&#39;re addicted. You&#39;re spending time and money that you used to use your brain and socialization for. GET OFF NETFLIX &amp; YOUTUBE, PUT DOWN THE BONG and GO LIVE YOUR LIFE! </p>

<p>Want real marijuana reform? Go to meetings. Liking NORML on Facebook or Twitter is NOT being an activist. SHIT OR GET OFF THE POT, literally, folks! </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of issues, just in one MA county. It&#39;s also very funny to me the number of marijuana grow operations busts recently, while the Medical Marijuana dispensaries are still awaiting regulation.

    <div class="md"><p>Colorado resident here. This has been going on for 14 years. It was a very slow pace, even a crawl up until 2008. </p>

<p>In 2008 the law here changed so that &quot;chronic pain&quot; was suitable to be used for MMJ cards, aka &quot;red cards.&quot; Once that happened, it was only a few months before the mass influx of mom &amp; pop MMJ shops began to open up. By 2010 it was a full blown industry with commercial packaging and investors starting to buy up MMJ shops. By 2012 there was no turning back ...</p>

<p>There is a lot of big money involved in this situation and the infrastructure was already there. There&#39;s very little stigma against pot in Colorado because it&#39;s been slowly introduced over a 14 year period. </p>

<p>The feds, on the other hand have very little oversight and ability to control what is going on in the state. There isn&#39;t enough DEA officers to shut it down without taking out half the population which has a card or is tied to the industry. Therefore, it makes a lot more sense to simply cave on the matter. </p>

<p>This is a freight train, it will not be stopped. The money is too much, the want is too great for the public.</p>

Recreational drugs have a strange way of making a person feel unoppressed. And at the same time, an &#39;opiate (or cannibanoid) for the masses&#39; would be clearly in the government&#39;s favor. If they can, I&#39;d imagine that they&#39;d want to influence how strains are bred to maximize the sedative and euphoric effects and minimize the more thought stimulating effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think it&#39;s a major crack in the matrix . It takes a huge bite from the illegal drug trade that the elite partake in through seven degrees of separation. Soon jail for pot will be senseless and half the private prison system will empty. Hemp will provide an infinitely more efficient way to do just about everything .

    <div class="md"><p>We will have to agree to disagree. All the freedoms slipping are things people learn of through non conventional media. Pot being legalized is not going to suddenly make people stop reading alternate news. If a person had that bent, they will keep on.

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is scripted and ready to roll out on the masses whenever the time is ripe for Them. Cannabis legalization appears on FOX (FAUX) News and suddenly its the hot topic of the country. Cannabis legalization is not news worthy unless the true reasoning for its mass broadcasting is mean&#39;t to warp your reality when something deceptive is about to take the country, or world, by storm right under your noses. When It occurs people will not have a clue what to do because they&#39;ve been duped into co-creating Their reality with Them. Instead of educating as much people as possible on the obvious world of deceit we&#39;ve been sold into &amp; what to do BEFORE &amp; DURING &amp; AFTER shit hits the fan, we have people who care about liberating a PLANT that was NEVER illegal to begin with. It has only been illegal inside Their paradigm which They have so cleverly fooled you into co-creating, thus putting you in bondage by your own ignorance of Natural Law. You can&#39;t make nature illegal, no matter how many laws these monsters pass. Do you now see the veil ?</p>

<p>a. You should make it legal, and then tax it loads. Think of the tax government!</p>

<blockquote>

However, their real zeal has been hijacked by the legalization of MJ message pushed by the Democrat Party. It&#39;s a poorly hidden secret that POTUS supported the dreadful Occupy movement. His acquiesce, or ambivalence to the legalization of MJ instantly gives POTUS traction with younger people he has not earned. This government is up to it&#39;s eyeballs in the drug business at every level.</p>

<p>If they weren&#39;t already confused enough politically, chronic MJ usage makes people lazy and much too comfortable. Why should I vote? I hear this lame excuse every time I speak to the druggy demographic. These young people, whether they exercise their voting franchise, or stay home are determining their own futures. </p>

<p>This Regime openly schemes to enslave us all. I know it&#39;s not popular to divulge this truth. Do you think a totalitarian dictatorship here in the USA is going to leave such a lucrative business model intact and capable of generating a fabulous revenue stream by private citizens.

When in actuality, man cannot outlaw nature. This is a perfect example of the mind control they&#39;ve used on the world. CANNABIS USERS, this is NOT a time to rejoice. It is time to pay attention! Cannabis will skyrocket in price, be taxed, modified genetically, heavily patented and yet again will be the cornerstone of drug propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps guilty here for making some fun of the hypocrisy of Obama and the continued war on drugs.  But seriously,  we beg for this,  beg for that,  and our politicians are sold to the highest bidder.   You think begging on TPP or NSA is going to stop the big money?   People are also more alienated and helpless for being constantly hounded by the police state for petty offenses that were never legitimate offenses in the first place.    The post about Obama and marijuana exposed for me how many people who believe those prison terms were legitimate.   You think people like that are going to get their act together on Citizens United?</p>

<p>I dont think it has been illegal for the reasons they have been stating for decades (obviously).</p>

<p>I think they genuinely want to punish drug users, and prevent as much as they can, because of the effects of drugs on people&#39;s consciousness. examples include perspective shifts, open-mindedness, positivity, acceptance of others, yourself and the world, etc.</p>
