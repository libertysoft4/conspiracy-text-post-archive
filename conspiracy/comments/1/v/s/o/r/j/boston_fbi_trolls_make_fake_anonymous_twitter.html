<p>Okay folks. Here it is ... AyRiv was doxed by her FJ friends. Don&#39;t know why. Don&#39;t care. Hedge asked that I follow her after she locked up her account and went private. I did, because Hedge asked. AyRiv made several posts that I found extremely offensive. A virtual smear campaign against our military. I don&#39;t need to tolerate that on my TL. Blast your hate for our military somewhere else. After she apologized to me for the fact that she drives a car plastered with messages about her disdain for our military, I saw her defending her religion of peace along with pics smearing our military more. Hypocrite much? The religion that seems to have a problem with killing it&#39;s own people? HA! Get outta here with your skewed views &amp; insincere apologies. You don&#39;t see me blasting my Christianity or my political views on my TL. I joined forces with all of you and set aside my personal views for a greater good. We ALL did that in the beginning. That was lost somewhere along the way. I DO, and always will support our men and women who defend our country. If you don&#39;t respect that, I have NO tolerance for you. She was welcomed into our little group, and yet showed no respect for the views of others, IMO. I snapped. I got pissed. I blocked her &amp; went on a minor rant, which is viewable to all. I mentioned no one specifically. I then pointed out that Todd Kincannon was doing something good by trying to help a man who was suicidal. This apparently upset a few, mostly Splendid. Last night, JM attempted to take me to task for &#39;supporting&#39; Todd Kincannon in an effort to champion his friend Splendid. I DO NOT support Todd Kincannon. I DO support freedom of speech!!! JM was SO upset, that he chose to UNfollow me in the middle of our &#39;conversation&#39;. I thought it respectful to only do the same. He then proceeded to smear me behind his protected acct, where I couldn&#39;t see what was being said, and couldn&#39;t defend myself. Punk move JM. This morning, Splendid decided to take me to task over a tweet I pushed regarding the Muslim Brotherhood. I still have no clue why. Her defense of the Muslim Brotherhood would be the equivalent of my defending Westboro Baptist Church. I truly don&#39;t believe Splendid knows what the MB is. Moderate Muslims don&#39;t support them. I&#39;m completely baffled and shocked. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening from my viewpoint, minus the accusations that I&#39;m a cunt &amp; a member of the KKK &amp; a few other things. I can&#39;t even get mad because JM &amp; Splendid both came at me with uninformed and/or uneducated opinions. I am, however, tired of being the object of people&#39;s anger. JM &amp; Splendid ... I forgive you. AyRiv ... I got nothin for you. I&#39;m tired of watching this all fall apart. I&#39;ll be UNfollowing ALL of the #BostonStrong group. The real friendships I&#39;ve made among this group exist outside of twitter. If I don&#39;t already have your number and/or email, and you wish to continue a friendship, let me know. Goodbye. Good luck. God bless. Stay forever #BostonStrong <a href="http://tl.gd/n_1rrcf0u">http://tl.gd/n_1rrcf0u</a> · - </p>

<p>after this thread was started, we continued digging into these Boston FBI scumbags, and re-discovered the cold-case murder of Ibragim Todashev... </p>

<p>Group Accuses FBI of Harassing Friends of Ibragim Todashev, Man Shot to Death During Questioning About Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect <a href="http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Group-Accuses-FBI-of-Harassing-Friends-of-Ibragim-Todashev-Man-Shot-to-Death-During-Questioning-About-Boston-Marathon-Bombing-Suspect-225237792.html">http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Group-Accuses-FBI-of-Harassing-Friends-of-Ibragim-Todashev-Man-Shot-to-Death-During-Questioning-About-Boston-Marathon-Bombing-Suspect-225237792.html</a></p>

<p>Did FBI Execute Friend of Boston Bombing Suspect During Interrogation? <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/did-fbi-execute-friend-of-boston-bombing-suspect-during-interrogation_112013">http://www.thedailysheeple.com/did-fbi-execute-friend-of-boston-bombing-suspect-during-interrogation_112013</a> </p>

<p>Father of slain Tsarnaev associate pens letter to Obama, alleges FBI deliberately killed son The father of Ibragim Todashev, former friend of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, has released an open letter to President Barack Obama calling for justice after his son’s murder. Todashev was killed by FBI agents in May.</p>

<p><a href="http://conservativeread.com/father-of-slain-tsarnaev-associate-pens-letter-to-obama-alleges-fbi-deliberately-killed-son/">http://conservativeread.com/father-of-slain-tsarnaev-associate-pens-letter-to-obama-alleges-fbi-deliberately-killed-son/</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal prosecutors have stated that Ibragim allegedly implicated Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a 2011 triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts. Anonymous FBI sources told reporters that Todashev also implicated himself in those murders... </p>

<p>One friend of Todashev, Ashurmamad Miraliev, was arrested by the FBI on September 18 on a warrant for supposedly threatening a witness in an Osceola County battery case 14 months ago.
Yet following his arrest, he was interrogated for six hours only about associations with Todashev – despite repeatedly requesting his right to an attorney, CAIR-Florida said. The FBI agents allegedly responded, “That is not happening.”</p>
