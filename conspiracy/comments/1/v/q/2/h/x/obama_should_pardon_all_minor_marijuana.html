<p>Edit:  Thanks for the responses!   I guess the NSA has enough data on all this to settle any disputes out there about the corruption of the system.   Wouldn&#39;t the NSA have an incredible amount of dirt on each of the sold out scum we &quot;elected&quot;,  wouldn&#39;t they have the nail in the coffin for every criminal plan these politicians have hatched against us,  including the TPP,  including Citizens United?   Lets just hear the phone conversations and see the emails for Scalia and Roberts for example,  right?   What to speak of the untold little abuses that are plea bargained away with threats and never brought to the light of justice.   Its all there at the NSA,  and it could be turned against the 1% instead of the 99%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget timing.   Power trumps both money and morality when the timing is right,  when a re-alignment coincides with a generational shift.   The fact that Obama has put the cards on the table tells you that the money is already moving.   Morality is a pawn in this business,  it is always the loser.   Money and power move together until they don&#39;t.   And when power and money separate,  it is power that comes out on top.  When power and money separate,  THAT is timing.   There are signs that the time of shift is happening.   Might be a good time to take a small short bet in prison stocks.</p>

<p>Then what are you saying?

<p>How is that <strong>not</strong> you saying that things will never change, so just live with it?  Because that&#39;s exactly what it sounds like to me.</p>

<p>Edit: It seems like we both agree that the system that&#39;s in place is bullshit.  The difference is that you don&#39;t seem to have any hope that things can improve in the future whereas I do.  I think we, ultimately, are on the same side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the idea of that, freeing those unjustly jailed. I love the idea of freedom for all. But, I want to play devils advocate for just a second. Imagine, across all states that the Feds decide to pardon all minor marijuana offenders, assume it is less than 1 oz of possession and have no intent to distribute. Lets put the number at ~100,000 (i think it is a fair number, maybe even low. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/20/marijuana-s-victims.html">Here is a great article about that</a> )</p>

<p>So now we have 100k people with no jobs, some with no place to live, no families that they can turn to, or with families that now have to share the burden of providing for someone what has been out of the already depleted job market, sometimes for as long as 10 years. </p>

<p>Lets say these guys are all fully pardoned and convictions removed, ergo they are free and can vote and don&#39;t need to answer yes to that pesky felony conviction question of the application. What will they tell the employers about the 3-5 year gap in their employment history? While they are now free, they could be in a worse position...free without means to support. Where as before they got 3 hots and a cot, some of them may not even get that.</p>

<p>I have been in jail before, and I do not wish it upon anyone, so i am not saying this with a light heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be fair, anyone in jail for a simple possession level conviction will not be there for decades. These guys will be on the streets pretty soon anyway, and as you mentioned, with all the limitations that &quot;he&#39;s been in jail&quot; comes with.</p>

<p>The guys who were trafficking pounds and upwards of the stuff are typically guilty of other things -- even if they were 100% nonviolent, they&#39;re still guilty of tax evasion. Perhaps the possession component of the sentence could be rescinded, but it would be a hard sell to pardon big time tax evasion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your right about the simple possession, and I don&#39;t know where I can get the source info, but there are some offenders that are some small amount long servers, but probably less than the 100K I posted earlier. I never thought about the tax evasion angle, but if it is possession and not selling/distribution, then I don&#39;t see how than can make a case concerning evasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true that people will do what they will do.  In many cases what people pursue is their own happiness and relief from stress.  These activities in no sane system would be considered as crimes, no doubt, as they cause no material harm to another person or property.  It is the nature of authoritarianism to maintain its status of superiority based on a façade of superior attributes in all respects.  The system must maintain a posture of infallibility and credulity for otherwise its right to be in authority is challenged.  Though fallibility is intrinsic to human nature, authoritarian systems comprised of humans still strive to maintain it as they view the system of their collective efforts as somehow a separate and superior entity free of their individual faults.  It will encroach progressively into all aspects of everyone&#39;s lives until it manifests its own self-destruction.  Any system that is not sustainable will ultimately collapse.  Until that point it will push forward without relent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do agree with this a thought occurred to me that provides the only legitimate reason i can see for keeping them at least to a certain reasonable minimum sentence assuming their criminal record will be erased upon release. The offenders are in jail for breaking the law, while the law may now have been changed, the fact remains that they broke the law of the time. Objectively (and I can&#39;t stress that enough) releasing people immediately sends the message that if you feel a law today might not be a law tomorrow, you can break that law expecting to be released as soon as it is revoked. This is something that can potentially cause a lot of problems as people may see it as an excuse to break any law they feel could be overturned, the prediction of what law may be overturned being subject to the individuals own perception. I understand this is a hideous and unjust law that never should have existed, and ridiculous sentences should definitely be cut right down, but to instantly release everybody incarcerated for it may be interpreted, by some, as an excuse to break any law they want. While I do feel that it is a citizen&#39;s responsibility to break unjust laws, we must be very careful how we do this, given the vast divide between what the blind majority and the awake minority feels is unjust, potential chaos could ensue. Personally, I feel current possession convictions could* be reduced to a period of say 6 months (rough number for arguments sake) should the convict have already served it, they should be released (in cases of multiple years served, compensation should be awarded), if not, they should complete the 6 months and be absolved of any criminal record upon release. I&#39;m all for legalisation and drastically reduced Government regulations, but we must be careful of the implications that disregard for the law may bring about upon a public not accustomed to freedom, so thirsty for it in fact that they may run wild initially. An admittedly heavy example would be the rescued Jews in concentration camps that the allies free&#39;d that had to be carefully fed back to health as they were so malnourished they would want to eat an amount that was in fact unhealthy given their weakened condition, food rations were carefully distributed for their own good, under the supervision of medical professionals. Personally though I still do feel they should be released, but without reasonable consideration to both sides of any argument, we could not say we have made a reasonable judgement. Thoughts? (edit marked * &#39;should&#39; - &#39;could&#39; illustrating an idea as opposed to my own position mentioned at the end)</p>

<h2>Myth: Prisons are full of people in for marijuana possession</h2>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong> About 750,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana offenses in the U.S. There&#39;s a lot of variation across states in what happens next. Not all arrests lead to prosecutions, and relatively few people prosecuted and convicted of simple possession end up in jail. Most are fined or are placed into community supervision. About 40,000 inmates of state and federal prison have a current conviction involving marijuana, and about half of them are in for marijuana offenses alone; most of these were involved in distribution. Less than one percent are in for possession alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many people are actually in prison for possession of small amounts of weed and nothing else? I don&#39;t know so I&#39;ll be glad to see proof, but I have a feeling the number is really low, certainly I&#39;d be shocked if it&#39;s really &quot;tens of thousands&quot;. </p>

<p>I am assuming by &quot;minor marijuana possession&quot; you mean personal use amount, not selling and no other crime attached to it. If you meant something else then, never mind.</p>

Breaking the law to that degree is excessive and unnaceptable even if it is just a plant. Plus, I don&#39;t think you can get really far in the drug market even as I said before it is &quot;just a plant&quot; by being a stand up sweethearted guy necessarily.

<p>I believe you&#39;ll find that it is a  much smaller number than what you think it is.  Possession of small amounts of marijuana (with no reason to be declared as intent to sell) is not something that is typically punished with lengthy prison sentences.  I believe you are probably considering more of the instances where they ended up imprisoned with a three strike rule or some other such rule - where a multitude of minor offenses eventually leads to a larger sentence.  </p>

<p>These are criminals, plain and simple. They broke the law. Is it a stupid law?

<p>&quot;Yeah the law is completely unjust but, whelp, the law&#39;s the law!  Gotta follow it no matter how stupid and unethical it is!  Oh and our economy is also kinda struggling right now so fuck those people who are imprisoned unjustly.&quot;</p>

<p>While of course for this to happen, the federal government would have to (long-due) de-criminilize drug possession (for personal use) and consumption, even if solely for marijuana, and apply it retroactively.</p>

<p>But ... how then can <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donald-cohen/lockup-quotas-lowcrime-ta_b_3956336.html">states manage &quot;minimum occupancy rates&quot; or &quot;lock-up quotas&quot; for private prisons ?</a>.</p>

<p>And another thing.... if they let all these potheads out of jail, do you realize how the demand for pot will skyrocket and maybe it&#39;ll even create a shortage? What will decent folks do then with pot in short supply and the price going even higher? </p>
