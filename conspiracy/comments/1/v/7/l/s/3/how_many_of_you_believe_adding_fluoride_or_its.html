<p>This is all I need to know. If there is even a <em>possibility</em> of a hardening/accumulation of flouride in the pineal gland, it sounds extremely harmful to me. </p>

<p>The woo-woo part would be an intentional poisoning to lower our creative thinking as well as spiritual awakening becoming increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>If somebody is dis-content enough with their lives spiritually, they will more easily buy into mass-consumerism. </p>

<p>I only consider this because I have experienced DMT and extremely hyper-spiritual experiences that connect with the godhead, giving perspective on life that some people would definitely not want out in the open. There are definitely links between the pineal and the spiritual path.</p>

<p>Because fluoride&#39;s &quot;benefits&quot; are only topical, meaning there is no reason to eat or drink it</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sharecare.com/health/dental-drugs/how-does-systemic-fluoride-work">Check out the &quot;answers&quot; about <strong>systemic fluoride</strong> on this page.</a></p>

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When young children consume fluoride in drinking water and other beverages or in supplements, <strong>the fluoride is absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract, taken up by the bloodstream and deposited into the permanent teeth as they are developing behind the gum line.</strong></p>

<p>Systemic fluoride makes those developing teeth stronger and better able to withstand the effects of cavity-causing acids and bacteria later on. Once the permanent teeth have erupted from the gum line (usually by the time a child is eight years old), systemic fluoride still offers benefits because <strong>it becomes incorporated into saliva</strong>, making that protective. Talk to your dentist about the benefits of systemic fluoride and whether you and your family are meeting your fluoride needs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So according to the experts, the fact that we&#39;re drinking fluoridated water (AND soda AND beer AND Kool-Aid AND etc) means that our bodies become SO FUCKING SATURATED with this glorious gift of god that we&#39;re literally floating in the shit.</p>

<p>And unless this is some newfangled &quot;smart fluoride&quot; that only goes to the teeth, every fucking cell in our bodies and brains is saturated.</p>

<p>Every.Fucking.Cell.</p>

<p>But it &quot;helps prevent cavities - RIGHT?</p>

<p>If that works so well, maybe we should add insecticide to our water supply - that way we won&#39;t have to worry about the danger of ticks, lice, mosquitoes etc because we&#39;ll be walking sacks of poison.</p>

<p>Brilliant, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not counting additional sources of fluoride. I didn&#39;t know if anyone actually went through each of those sources, but it&#39;s really worth your time. Things like pickles and wine can add significant amounts. There&#39;s even residues on all kinds of foods because they spray fluoride onto the food in warehouses. 70 ppm tolerance on food and 130 ppm for wheat. And I&#39;m <em>really</em> glad that I never liked tea. A tea drinker can easily get more fluoride per day than a non-tea drinker who uses tap water. </p>

<p>&quot;Fluorine has played a significant role in insect control since about 1896 when sodium fluoride and various iron fluorides were patented in England as insecticides. Sodium fluoride was used in the United States for cockroach control before 1900 and was introduced in 1915 for the control of poultry lice. However, the use of fluorine insecticides did not become general until the 1930´s when the disadvantages of arsenical residues on food crops became apparent and the inorganic fluorine compounds were introduced as safer substitutes. Systematic investigation of organofluorine insecticides began about 1935 in the I. G. Farbenindustrie and the fluoroalcohols and fluorophosphates (phosphorofluoridates) were intensively investigated largely through the research of Schrader (1952). During World War II fluoro-DDT or &quot;Gix&quot; was used for the control of insects of medical importance. More recently, fluoroacetamide and analogues have been used as systemic insecticides and a large variety of other fluorinated organic compounds have shown insecticidal activity. Sulfuryl fluoride has recently been marketed as a fumigant for household and structural pests...&quot;</p>

<p>In its review of fluoride, the NRC (2006) noted that the safety and the risks of fluoride at concentrations of 2–4 mg/L were incompletely documented.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t get access to the NRC report so unfortunately I couldn&#39;t investigate any further.  You should be calling for more thorough research on the risks of fluoride rather than proclaiming things that have no evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re deliberately stretching the numbers here, but I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Anyone reading- notice he chose the highest number in the study to compare to the lowest dose in the US. </p>

<p>The reality is this: In the US, water is fluoridated between .7 and 4 mg/l. That is dangerously close to the doses in the study. If a statistical trend was found in a population with levels just slightly above the levels in the US, then you know that slightly higher levels cause brain damage. Is it possible that some people in the US get levels at these higher numbers? Yes. </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t counting additional sources of fluoride. This is from a poster from a month ago who actually went through and dismantled every myth about fluoride: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sizd4/is_the_fluoride_conspiracy_true/cdy24b6">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sizd4/is_the_fluoride_conspiracy_true/cdy24b6</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just quoting the study he linked to, I really wasn&#39;t trying to be misleading.  I hope everybody who&#39;s interested in this reads the actual study rather than taking my word for it.</p>

<p>Regarding the comment you linked to, that poster is highly misleading with his headlines</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/">Because a Harvard meta analysis confirms that fluoride doses attainable within the US cause brain damage</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already went over this.  The study says nothing about &quot;brain damage&quot;, and his summary is heavily biased toward his own point of view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/18/10/1102.abstract">Because fluoride in daily attainable dosages within the US lowers thyroid function in people with low iodine levels, and was once prescribed for hyperthyroidism</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paper (from 1958) studies only people with hyperthyroidism, which is an extremely important point that the poster fails to mention.  They administered a daily does of 5-10 mg of fluoride, which would have been on top of the fluoride that is already contained in their drinking water (which was higher back then than it is now).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15153698/">Because fluoride&#39;s &quot;benefits&quot; are only topical, meaning there is no reason to eat or drink it</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure what he&#39;s trying to get at here.  The study he linked to spends most of its time talking about all of the benefits of water fluoridation.  The only argument they&#39;re having is how exactly that effect is occurring (pre-eruptive vs. post-eruptive).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since that post was heavily sourced and the OP clearly spent time on it, why don&#39;t you re-write the headlines from an unbiased point of view? Not pro-fluoride, not anti-fluoide, but someone who is simply reporting the information. But keep in mind the section of each article that the OP is focusing on. So for instance, the sulfuryl fumigation link. He&#39;s obviously focusing on the fact that the residues of fluoride are left on food and they are in such high doses that even the government thinks they need to phase it out. Try that and I&#39;ll bet your headlines would be similar to his. I spent a few days researching everything in that post when I first saw it. He&#39;s slightly biased, but you wouldn&#39;t be taking anything away from the post if you rewrote it with a 100 percent unbiased view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my list of headlines for the sources I looked at</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A review of studies in China shows that high levels of fluoride exposure may have a small adverse affect on child IQ test results (mean difference of 0.45).  Every study reviewed was significantly above the recommended level of 0.7 mg/L, but many studies were within the maximum allowed level of 4.0 mg/L.</p></li>
<li><p>Administration of a daily dose of 5-10 mg of fluoride to patients with hyperthyroidism may cause clinical improvement (limitation of hormonal synthesis).  Fluorine does not impair the capacity of the gland to synthesize thyroid hormone when there is an abundance of iodide in the blood. (this last sentence is word for word from the abstract)</p></li>
<li><p>There is an abundance of evidence that water fluoridation prevents dental caries, but we do not yet fully understand exactly what is going on.  This paper argues that topical fluoride application should be used to treat dental caries as long as proper precautions are in place to eliminate the risk of over-exposure.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I said I was going to stop so I never made it to the next link that you&#39;re talking about.  I&#39;m not trying to be misleading.  I looked at that link and it adds 11 new cases of accidental fluoride spillage or contamination.  You can hardly claim that as being &quot;routine&quot;, which was my point.</p>

<p>The link on sulfuryl fumigation is a good headline.  The negative effects of over-exposure to fluoride are not a contested topic, and it seems like the EPA is doing its part to make sure fluoride intake is at safe levels.</p>

It seems that other than dental florosis, calcification of the pineal gland is the most empirically proven effect of fluoride. Theoretically this could lead to circadian rhythm disruption by affecting the pineal gland&#39;s natural synthesis and secretion of melatonin.<br/>
The pineal gland has also been an important area of the brain for cultures interested in the third eye. Even Descartes describes the pineal gland as &quot;the principle seat of the soul&quot;</p>

There are people here in Raleigh and Durham really trying to get legislation changed but the people on the councils are old and shitty and couldnt care less.  There are videos on youtube of council meetings where amazing points are made about negative effects of the fluoride in the  water but the council members just ignore the speakers. It sucks.  It also baffles me that people that I regard as very intelligent, some more than my self, won&#39;t consider what could be in their water and what it could do to you.  So many people I know buying into the agenda.  No rational/critical thinking involved at all.  If anyone could post about the pineal gland that would be informative as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone else in this thread said they got fluorosis in their gums. So I&#39;d be very careful about letting it touch any membrane in your mouth.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be deadly but any negative reaction will compound over the years. Just use it with caution and try to keep it on your teeth.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d brush my teeth with normal strength toothpaste then do the fluoride treatment separately with extra caution.</p>

<p>Because fluoride&#39;s &quot;benefits&quot; are only topical, meaning there is no reason to eat or drink it</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sharecare.com/health/dental-drugs/how-does-systemic-fluoride-work">Check out the &quot;answers&quot; about <strong>systemic fluoride</strong> on this page.</a></p>

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When young children consume fluoride in drinking water and other beverages or in supplements, <strong>the fluoride is absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract, taken up by the bloodstream and deposited into the permanent teeth as they are developing behind the gum line.</strong></p>

<p>Systemic fluoride makes those developing teeth stronger and better able to withstand the effects of cavity-causing acids and bacteria later on. Once the permanent teeth have erupted from the gum line (usually by the time a child is eight years old), systemic fluoride still offers benefits because <strong>it becomes incorporated into saliva</strong>, making that protective. Talk to your dentist about the benefits of systemic fluoride and whether you and your family are meeting your fluoride needs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So according to the experts, the fact that we&#39;re drinking fluoridated water (AND soda AND beer AND Kool-Aid AND etc) means that our bodies become SO FUCKING SATURATED with this glorious gift of god that we&#39;re literally floating in the shit.</p>

<p>And unless this is some newfangled &quot;smart fluoride&quot; that only goes to the teeth, every fucking cell in our bodies and brains is saturated.</p>

<p>Every.Fucking.Cell.</p>

<p>But it &quot;helps prevent cavities - RIGHT?</p>

<p>If that works so well, maybe we should add insecticide to our water supply - that way we won&#39;t have to worry about the danger of ticks, lice, mosquitoes etc because we&#39;ll be walking sacks of poison.</p>

<p>Brilliant, no?</p>
