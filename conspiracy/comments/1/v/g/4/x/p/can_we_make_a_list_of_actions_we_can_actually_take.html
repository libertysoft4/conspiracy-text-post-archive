        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seeing the state of affairs that the United States Government has sunken to can bring about a feeling of hopelessness, even as more and more of their twisted ways are seeing the light of day and hopefully being eradicated over time. How can we bring this about faster? What laws need to be in place once we get the current crooks out to restrain the new ones? For example:</p>

<p>To curb the militarization of our police:</p>

<p>Make it mandatory for all Law Enforcement Officers to wear a video recording camera at all times. If their state issued and tax-payer funded equipment is ever found to be not in working order when a case is being reviewed, they are automatically subject to a 2 week suspension WITHOUT pay. 2nd time in their career is 1 month. 3rd time is 3. The issues surrounding the case are reviewed by an outside moderator and can lead to dismissal, longer suspension or criminal charges if deemed necessary.</p>

<p>To curb our Corporatism Politics:</p>

<p>There is a cap set for the donation amount allowed by any Company or Business, its Directors and Board Members. An easily navigable index of Donors is made for each Politician in the House, Senate and so on ensuring their affiliations and motives can be called into question on each issue that they vote on.</p>

<p>To stop the overreach of the Intelligent Agencies:</p>

<p>As Kennedy said best, they should be smashed into a thousand little pieces. Intelligent agencies must have more oversight and regulation. The CIA, NSA, FBI need to be cleared out and I wish I could use each agencies own information on themselves to do it. I don&#39;t have any grand ideas here besides making the positions be elected by the people of the United States and limited to terms of 4 years. All actions must be signed off by the Chiefs of Staff and then the President. These agencies are the ones that scare me the most, seeing as they&#39;ve been pulling the strings behind the scenes for over 50 years now.</p>

<p>To stop freedom of speech and internet rights from being taken away:</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new age. Time to place some new language in the Bill of Rights. This can be dangerous and I don&#39;t even trust the Supreme Court to make sure the language isn&#39;t written in a way to screw us, so we would have to figure out how to do so. Perhaps have a national vote where 75% approval is needed before it is up for approval by the High Court.</p>

<p>To stop potential (and current) pollutants in our public water systems:</p>

<p>On every election ballot, this issue is up for debate. The people of every county should be allowed to determine what is or isn&#39;t added into their water.</p>

<p>To stop DEA overreach:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, we know they have deals with the cartels so that it&#39;s members can&#39;t go to jail, why should our citizens. Decriminalization of drugs in the United States. Minors are put in rehabilitation centers and public intoxication and driving while intoxicated laws are those that are enforced. If you don&#39;t go after the big guys (CIA, Cartels), you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to go after the small ones.</p>

<p>To reduce the Banking nightmare:</p>

<p>Please help me out here. I don&#39;t know how to fix the system, just like many other Americans do not. That is why they are getting away with tiny slaps on the wrist. A new crime code needs to be written and if the private owned prisons want to recoup their losses from the end of the Drug War, go after these guys. Manipulation, price-setting and money laundering is running rampant and we gave these guys even more money??</p>

<p>Those are my small ideas. Hopefully it sparks some discussion and debate. I&#39;m not saying my ideas are right, I just hope we can come up with a plan of action as a community and work towards it in the coming years. Oh, also, any time spent working for any of the intelligence agencies should immediately become public once you run for public office. I don&#39;t want another puppet for President.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As well as <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/">Citizen Investigation Team</a> and <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/">Pilots for 9/11 Truth</a>, who have been unfairly banned (along with their supporters) from the the site you moderate, <a href="http://911blogger.com/">911blogger</a>.</p>

<p>See the front page of the November 2010 issue of the Rock Creek Free Press, <a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf%E2%80%8E">&quot;Is Leading 9/11 Truth Site Working for the Other Side?&quot;</a>  The allegations in that article have never been disproven or even addressed, despite a ridiculous 13 page &quot;response&quot; from Gregg Roberts that only slings ad hominems.  </p>

<p>For example, a respected journalist made a video about his support of Citizen Investigation Team, but 911blogger refused to post it.  Same with a video of support made by a former NASA flight director:  never posted, no reason given. </p>

<p>Edit:  link to the pdf of the Nov 2010 RCFP does not seem to be working properly, but the main page for the paper is <a href="http://www.rockcreekfreepress.com/">here</a> and all issues are available as pdfs down the left hand side of the page.  The paper is sadly no longer publishing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>911blogger.com has proven itself to be controlled opposition on multiple occasions and not just with CIT; well into 2013 the moderators were quietly deleting comments that didn&#39;t violate the site&#39;s posted rules.  </p>

<p>For example, regarding the Boston Bombings, activist Sheila Casey wrote an excellent article exposing staged damage.  Since I still occasionally monitor 911blogger, I caught on to the fact that regular user &quot;Joe&quot; left a quiet comment in which the subject heading was &quot;staged damage&quot; followed by the URL to Sheila&#39;s article.  I emailed her the comment, so I still have <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2013-05-20/who-boston-bombing-story-mysteries-russ-baker-may-14-2013#comment-259541">the URL to that comment</a>.  Someone on the moderation team deleted it within a few hours, but apparently nothing ever gets permanently deleted from the site&#39;s database so Orangatan can use his mod status and check out the original comment for himself, which clearly didn&#39;t violate any of the site rules.</p>

<p>Likewise, I wrote a highly critical review of Kevin Ryan&#39;s book, in which I highlighted Ryan&#39;s overemphasis on Saudi Arabia and underemphasis on the Israeli/Zionist involvement in 9/11.  Someone at 911blogger left a comment that didn&#39;t even mention my review or link to it, but merely expressed the similar concern that Ryan totally glossed over key suspects from the Zionist cloth.  I wish I had taken a screenshot of the comment because this, too, was quietly deleted within a few hours, probably by either Justin Keogh or Orangatan.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we know that the commenters themselves didn&#39;t delete the comments, because the comment boxes completely vanished; when a user deletes a comment, s/he has to &quot;edit&quot; the comment and write in: &quot;Deleted.&quot;  The comment box always stays up.</p>

<p>Another former user of 911blogger put it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7220Y65RJUI/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;asin=B007DVDV2S&amp;amp;cdForum=Fx3FRTSPGFNOK9H&amp;amp;cdMsgID=MxML0WXAHCWMLO&amp;amp;cdMsgNo=2&amp;amp;cdPage=1&amp;amp;cdSort=oldest&amp;amp;cdThread=Tx37NINHN9J8O3K&amp;amp;store=digital-text#MxML0WXAHCWMLO">this way:</a></p>

<p>&quot; The reason my account was suspended is because the owner of the site, Roger Peters, aka dz, had warned both Mr. Gold and me not to comment on each others&#39; posts because long arguments inevitably ensued. Mr. Gold was the first to break the rule by proceeding to attack me, and after I responded to his attacks my account was suspended for violating the rule set by dz. Some users urged me to appeal the suspension as they had successfully done, but at that point it was clear to me that 911blogger was a site controlled by friends of Mr.Gold to provide him a platform where he would be promoted as a movement &quot;leader&quot; and not have to answer to criticism.   There&#39;s no point in denying anything since I have archived all the relevant comment threads and emails showing my version to be true and Jon gold&#39;s to be a distortion...&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin Ryan is in the &quot;holier than thou&quot; category amongst Orangatan and his friends.  You&#39;re only allowed to give Ryan kudos and respect for his &quot;Another Nineteen&quot; book; if you offer a critical view, your comment will most likely deleted and you won&#39;t have the privilege of commenting without moderation anymore.</p>

<p>911blogger.com was either controlled opposition from the beginning or it got heavily infiltrated along the way; in either case, Orangatan wittingly or unwittingly plays the role of gatekeeper.</p>

<p>ETA: <a href="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/827/4vh3.jpg">This screenshot</a> from 2010 says a lot; even those unfamiliar with the inside baseball of the time can look at this image and get the gist.</p>

<p>Nor any explanation for why Adam Ruff, Adam Syed and Stefan were simultaneously banned from 911blogger  -- at the exact moment that they were winning an online argument with <a href="http://wtcdemolition.com/blog/node/3053">911blogger mod Erik Larson</a> about the work of Citizen Investigation Team.  </p>

<p>If you have an explanation, let&#39;s hear it.  Slapping down a link that does not address the Creek&#39;s allegations is just more evasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orangutan and the rest of the 911Blogger mods are pathetic censors and nothing more. The site is a joke as all heavily censored sites are ultimately. If 911blogger itself or any of the mods had a valid argument against CIT&#39;s findings at the Pentagon they could articulate it and it would withstand counter arguments. Their stone wall of silence on the matter is the only option they have because if they were to debate it in the open for all to see they would be exposed as the complete charlatans they really are. Kevin Ryan as well has no leg to stand on regarding the Pentagon which is why he cannot participate in an open debate on the subject and can only sling mud from the sidelines and then refuse to face those he attacks. Cowardly is the perfect word to describe both 911Blogger and Kevin Ryan. A real truther would not hide from debate he or she would embrace it as an opportunity to expose the truth even if that truth was that he or she was wrong.</p>

<p>Anyone who participates at 911Blogger is taking part in an illusion of free and open discussion about 9/11. The site is totally 100% controlled by the mods and if you have a difference of opinion you will be purged. If you doubt that try asking why CIT and over 3 dozen of their vocal supporters were banned from the site even though no rules were broken and just see how long you last before you too are purged by the Stalinist mods. See at 911Blogger you either agree with everything the mods say or you are gone simple as that. You echo the meme’s they want you to echo or you’re done. If you do not go the direction they are trying to steer you into going all of a sudden you will find it strangely difficult to post anything. For all anyone knows at this point the entire site is run by the NSA’s Q group. If you want to know what a real uncensored blog is like visit Truth and Shadows and see the world of difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think being involved in some way is better than not being involved at all. Beyond voting there&#39;s a lot that can come of local activism, there was a Walmart and residential development that was shut down its tracks by local activism (my friends and I spoke at the town hearing about this matter), and another friend of mine heads a group that plants trees and runs workshops for Youth Programs around here (which I help out with a bit). Sure it isn&#39;t stopping SuperPACs or FISA courts, but there are achievable things which you can get involved with immediately, and the small actions of many eventually result in larger trends in a country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am advocating for a different sort of involvement.  You keep focusing on little  insignificant, feel good issues and the things that actually matter will steamroll the &quot;community&quot; regardless of the presence of a Walmart.</p>

<p>Every action taken can be one against those truly in power if effort and thought are put into it.  Otherwise the unimaginative will keep putting bandaids on cancer until the body is completely rotten from within.  </p>

<p>I do support community building etc, just after the larger issues are addressed, as otherwise said building is completely pointless.  For example if abolitionists had pushed for larger meals or less whippings for local slaves instead of fighting the real problem (eternal human servitude) nothing would have changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I would like to here your suggestions then. If its something as vague as revolution or as vindictive as hang the bankers that line of thought is not going anywhere, at least at this moment. If you try to get involved in activism you&#39;ll realize that often the only issues you can confront are the ones that you toss aside as trivial. If there was a wide-spread movement for a true revolution I would be one of the crowd, but activism is compartmentalized at the moment. The best option we have right now is self-reliance and community building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing vague or vindictive about a revolution when it is properly planned and executed.  The first step is an easy one (in comparison individually), take control of the narrative.  Become a pulsing node of information.  Spread well thought out points any way possible.  Internet and IRL.  Volunteer as much as possible with youth.  Talk to anyone and everyone.  Launch discussion groups, book clubs etc.  Like I said a few posts ago, it requires an immense amount of time, energy, devotion, sacrifce, knowledge, brainpower, etc, but when done properly, and with enough people critical mass will be the next stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of those points are exclusive of having some involvement in the community. When Walmart came up so did the topic of corporate and wage fascism. The reason we became involved in stopping the residential development is because we did our homework, and found out that it was being built on top of an old orchard which had used pesticides containing arsenic in the 70&#39;s. Sure enough the tested levels of arsenic in the groundwater were several times higher than the surrounding areas. I&#39;ve already mentioned my friend volunteer group with the youth, and of course all of us try to stand our ground when it comes to our opinions. </p>

<p>In fact my aforementioned friend is a fervent believer in chemtrails and even though I don&#39;t fully believe in them myself, I encourage him to discuss it with other people, so that the listener might be exposed to an idea which is outside the everyday repetition, and that he can flesh out the rationality behind his idea. </p>

<p>It sounds like you have a presumption of who an activist is, and what he/she should do. True there are a lot of airheaded activists who might as well be Agenda 21 spokespeople, but theres plenty of people with good intentions and locally active. If you&#39;re thinking about activism I&#39;d suggest reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_for_Radicals">Rules for Radicals</a>. Garnering awareness for your issue is great, as is discussing it, but it becomes an excuse for apathy if you don&#39;t try to change anything as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s way off the deep end.</p>

<p>I get that the system is rigged to make people who choose not to think for themselves do exactly as the system wants. Absolutely, 100% with you on that one.</p>

<p>The ignorance in the posts here though is the apparent advocacy for violence as a means to correct that. Violence won&#39;t solve it. It will worsen it.</p>

<p>The solution is education. Wake up people who won&#39;t think for themselves. Get them to start thinking. Then get them to vote.</p>

<p>While we do hear about some vote-rigging in some elections, it seems doubtful that it&#39;s so widespread that if everyone did get off their ass and write someone in (Oaklahoma being an apparent exception), that person would win.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just no way TPTB could overcome it if they rigged it and then half the nation said, &quot;no, I wrote in this other name&quot; and they were all the same name.</p>

<p>Assassination would be another problem that TPTB could not overcome. So they killed the topmost guy? Then his (or her) VP gets the nod, not your establishment ass-kisser. That&#39;s how it works.</p>

<p>But, like I said before, go ahead and grab your pea-shooter and your friends with their pea-shooters and try your violence option. Let me know how it works out for you. But you might want to make sure your will is in order first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you do not seem to be able to process obvious parts of reality makes this reply pointless, but I&#39;ll state it just the same.  There is nothing further off the deep end than the type of cognitive dissonance and doublethink it takes to hold an opinion such as your own.
The silly little image you have in your mind of how things here work is comical at best.  As stated in my last post it would be impossible for a massive variety of reasons to vote as you describe and/or have the change of power take place as you describe.  But even if it were to (which it wouldn&#39;t) do you think TPTB would sit idly by?  Again wishful thinking at best.<br/>
Assassination, imprisonment, etc take place long before a group is powerful enough to vote in a &quot;top guy&quot;, let alone after he is actually in power.  The proles have their ranks thinned when any one of them comes close to challenging the power structure, what do you think mass surveillance is about?  This is just a tiny part of the overall system errected for keeping TPTB in place, again as my last post stated.</p>

<p>Never once did I advocate for violence.  Nice assumptions... just like the rest of your pathetic little theory, based on silly assumptions that of course have no basis in reality.  As to violence as a solution, it depends entirely upon the type of violence, as well as the problem and the desired solution.  Blanket statements are almost always wrong (let that rattle around for fun).</p>

<p>On an aside, if you had read my other posts in this thread you would already know I am advocating for education and spreading of knowledge, as a first step.</p>

<p>To sum up, voting in its current form is a waste of time and effort, anyone participating is supporting the broken system and seriously deluding themselves (further supporting said system).  Read my other posts in this thread for more on this.  For a more philosophical discussion of voting and democracy in its pure form (which we are no where even remotely near) and its potential and implications as we move further into the digital age, there&#39;s plenty to read about that elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the most legal thing we can do is build awareness. Here is the thing. If you post here, you already know the world has gone to shit. Any video posted here is essentially preaching to the choir. What we need to be doing on a consistent basis is posting these videos, these conversations to our personal facebook pages, twitter friends, snapchat etc. We need to be sharing all of this shit with people who AREN&#39;T like us. And we need to do it in a smart way. We should be sharing the same exact links at the same time in order to increase the chances that they go viral and reach more people. The more we convert to our side the better chance for more exposure, more disgruntled people. </p>

<p>The other legal thing we can do is put faces and names to a lot of this shit. Big corporation boards, police chiefs etc that make the decisions, their faces and names need to be blasted front page. Anything that can be obtained through legal means, whether its addresses, political affiliations, donations, whatever. ALL of that info should be published and connections need to be clearly drawn each and every time. </p>

<p>While libertarians might be the best approach, unfortunately it will only establish further the elites. And now with inequality rising, automation leading to disemployment, and so much more.</p>

<p>The only thing I can propose is regulation and transparency. A government should be as transparent as possible, with freely and orderly access to the government framework, finance and lobbyists. In case of sensitive information a deadline forcing the release. A truly independent judiciary system (no FISA&#39;s, or presidentially selected judges). And finally regulation, and if necessary to curb the markets higher taxes on capital gains and closing tax evading loopholes. </p>

<p>No im sorry thats not it.</p>

<p>Attachments in general and to a particular nation its a structure of the mind. And we are not our minds. Our minds are a tools to be used in the direction of truth and love. Unfortunately our minds have been co-oped by an unseen force call the flyer. It makes us into animals if we don&#39;t work to circumvent it. How it happen goes back to the adam an eve story which I can some day share or you can look up the knowledge yourself by researching gnostic teachings. Life is like an Ocean wherever one is in time, space or consciousness with winds and storms and constantly unexpected actions and consequences at any and all moments. We live in a dualistic world of cause and effect. But other worlds exist that transcend this boundary. But accepting that while we are on this earth and that it as a natural part of life gives one peace. By accepting that literally &quot;All structures are inherently unstable&quot; one can then move forward and live ones life at peace. But until one accepts this there can be no peace because a person will always try to create a stable structure but none exist in this world. Given enough time structures will always fail. This is why we cannot depend on them. So, there is peace in accepting the inevitable instabilities in literally all physical systems in the universe. Only then can one devise a practical way forward.</p>

<p>Change, in oneself and possible the world is created within. It doesn&#39;t come from agreeing or disagreeing with content of your mind. It comes from a body awareness of what one must do in ones life. But to have that awareness to change you need enough energy. and as it stands now, every human being on the planet is allotted a certain amount of energy. All of that energy is consumed by our day to day lives and there is none left to create the necessary momentum to bring real change in our life and into the world. So in order to have energy to we first have to reclaim energy from other areas of our life that we waste energy on. Once we have some energy reclaimed we can use that energy to start the process of cleaning ourselves of our social conditioning by first stopping ones internal dialog and attachment to self-importance. This is called by Don Juan &quot;Stopping the World&quot; everything we do in this world has some sense of self-importance attached to it. It is this self-importance that makes us think we need to be offended by the actions of others and it causes is suffering when the world doesnt work out the way we want it to.</p>

<p>Thats part of the process of reclaiming our true selves. I suggest to people that we need to clean ourselves out first of everything that divides the soul before we can see the world in a new light to effect the change we want. But we would probably be different people at the point and it may or may not be necessary to effect any change in the world since everything that happens is part of a larger design that must play itself out.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about this get Carlos Castanedas book &quot;The Teachings of Don Juan&quot; by far the closest knowledge I have ever seen that describes the human condition and how transcending it has been hidden from us.</p>

But I have learned that Ideologies do no bring peace. This isnt a belief its a way of lilving. Its up to you to choose which way works the best :)</p>

<p>Nationalism was created by the state to give the people a sense of direction so the people are easier to control. I can give you some information on that if you choose. If we really want to be free, we have to move beyond social constructs put in place to make us more susceptible to social pressures by our peers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy here in the US is an illusion. I hope it doesn&#39;t take you 50 years of your life to figure that out.</p>

<p>Ever since institution of the Federal Reserve this country has been bought and sold by the highest bidder. This country is a Corporatist state at best.</p>

<p>List of things we can do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Buy land where the weather is very moderate. Probably at high elevations and with natural aquifers nearby.</p></li>
<li><p>Have an arsenal of self-reliant tools such as geiger counters, reverse-osmosis filters - solar panels - indoor gardens.</p></li>
<li><p>Save as much beauty from our [mostly beautiful] culture. Have a basement of records and CD&#39;s. Books. Art.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep yourself in shape and have an escape plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Know where the food distribution centers are outside your city. In an emergency, the masses will be looting grocery stores and eachother, while food distribution centers in rural areas will have the freshest and most plentiful supplies of food.</p></li>
<li><p>Dont underestimate how much fresh water you need to stay alive.</p></li>
<li><p>Get out of the 5-day workweek, living hand to mouth mindset. Paying your rent/mortgage is not enough. Start building up your survival gear now.</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in the cryptocurrency economy. I suggest Litecoin or Bitcoin.  Consdier what rapid deflation means to how everything in your city operates.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine the worst things that could come out of your neighbors. Hope for the best, but imagine the worst.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;d like to think most people are going to come together and work through this to the best of their ability. But others will become monsters. Be prepared.</p>

<p>Edit: &quot;thigns coming out of your neighbors&quot; - terrifying.</p>

<p>So you might have one truck unloading eggs, or chickens, and another truck loading up with 10 kinds of different things to take directly to a Walmart or Grocer.</p>

<p>Some cities have trains distributing food, and I suspect these might be important for new infrastructure later on. </p>

When a government fails to grant rights to the people and removes the involvement of the people, the people have the right to change their government in a way that will allow for their unalienable rights to be protected. Governments should not be overthrown for trivial reasons; it is not typical for people to change a system that they are accustomed to. However, when the people have suffered many abuses under the control of a totalitarian leader, they not only have the right but the duty to overthrow that government.</p>

<p>This was the only topic I had a stance on. It&#39;s none of your business, but I believe the government has no right to tell me what I can put in my body, so no I&#39;m not anti-Silk Road. </p>

<p>Do you know what irony is? It&#39;s ironic that you are telling people to use Google to check the veracity of their claims, when you, yourself, make false claims that you, obviously, fail to check on Google. </p>

<p>Look up irony on Google, maybe you&#39;ll get a chuckle too. </p>

<p>If you have identified some sort of conspiracy, then map out its structure.

<p>In other words, while I admire the new legislation&#39;s intention, in the end, are criminals not going to be criminals?  How will making their actions <em>more</em> criminal change their behavior?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orangutan and the rest of the 911Blogger mods are pathetic censors and nothing more. The site is a joke as all heavily censored sites are ultimately. If 911blogger itself or any of the mods had a valid argument against CIT&#39;s findings at the Pentagon they could articulate it and it would withstand counter arguments. Their stone wall of silence on the matter is the only option they have because if they were to debate it in the open for all to see they would be exposed as the complete charlatans they really are. Kevin Ryan as well has no leg to stand on regarding the Pentagon which is why he cannot participate in an open debate on the subject and can only sling mud from the sidelines and then refuse to face those he attacks. Cowardly is the perfect word to describe both 911Blogger and Kevin Ryan. A real truther would not hide from debate he or she would embrace it as an opportunity to expose the truth even if that truth was that he or she was wrong.</p>

<p>Anyone who participates at 911Blogger is taking part in an illusion of free and open discussion about 9/11. The site is totally 100% controlled by the mods and if you have a difference of opinion you will be purged. If you doubt that try asking why CIT and over 3 dozen of their vocal supporters were banned from the site even though no rules were broken and just see how long you last before you too are purged by the Stalinist mods. See at 911Blogger you either agree with everything the mods say or you are gone simple as that. You echo the meme’s they want you to echo or you’re done. If you do not go the direction they are trying to steer you into going all of a sudden you will find it strangely difficult to post anything. For all anyone knows at this point the entire site is run by the NSA’s Q group. If you want to know what a real uncensored blog is like visit Truth and Shadows and see the world of difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you do not seem to be able to process obvious parts of reality makes this reply pointless, but I&#39;ll state it just the same.  There is nothing further off the deep end than the type of cognitive dissonance and doublethink it takes to hold an opinion such as your own.
The silly little image you have in your mind of how things here work is comical at best.  As stated in my last post it would be impossible for a massive variety of reasons to vote as you describe and/or have the change of power take place as you describe.  But even if it were to (which it wouldn&#39;t) do you think TPTB would sit idly by?  Again wishful thinking at best.<br/>
Assassination, imprisonment, etc take place long before a group is powerful enough to vote in a &quot;top guy&quot;, let alone after he is actually in power.  The proles have their ranks thinned when any one of them comes close to challenging the power structure, what do you think mass surveillance is about?  This is just a tiny part of the overall system errected for keeping TPTB in place, again as my last post stated.</p>

<p>Never once did I advocate for violence.  Nice assumptions... just like the rest of your pathetic little theory, based on silly assumptions that of course have no basis in reality.  As to violence as a solution, it depends entirely upon the type of violence, as well as the problem and the desired solution.  Blanket statements are almost always wrong (let that rattle around for fun).</p>

<p>On an aside, if you had read my other posts in this thread you would already know I am advocating for education and spreading of knowledge, as a first step.</p>

<p>To sum up, voting in its current form is a waste of time and effort, anyone participating is supporting the broken system and seriously deluding themselves (further supporting said system).  Read my other posts in this thread for more on this.  For a more philosophical discussion of voting and democracy in its pure form (which we are no where even remotely near) and its potential and implications as we move further into the digital age, there&#39;s plenty to read about that elsewhere. </p>
