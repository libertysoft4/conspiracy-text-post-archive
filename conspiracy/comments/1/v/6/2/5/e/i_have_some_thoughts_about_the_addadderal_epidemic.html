        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been taking adderal because I have problems focusing in school for a few years now. The amphetamine is an interesting topic for discussion. But my problem is about the &quot;disorder&quot;.</p>

<p>Most of the people I know with ADD are more creative, intelligent, and will devote larger chunks of time to a project (only if it interests them) compared to the average person.If they have this advantage, how come its labeled as a disorder? How come its recommended we are to be medicated? I could argue that add type people had an evolutionary advantage, and that&#39;s why its so prevalent today. We were not made to spend hours a day listening to someone lecture, and do homework!</p>

<p>The problem is obviously the school system. They treat everybody the same, for better or worse. People with ADD don&#39;t do well in school, they always daydream, they get in trouble for bad behavior, and they are forced to conform. My friend is a teacher at a elementary school, and he says he can tell who has ADD, and if they forgot their medicine. He knows when they take it, because it sucks their spirit. They no longer laugh, play, respond to other children. Mindless robots that do whatever they are asked. These medications are powerful, and they do good in the right situations, but I think their harmful on a developing mind.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not on Adderal ;). I&#39;ve just been thinking about this a lot. What do you think?</p>

<p>The question isn&#39;t if ADHD is real or not, but if it&#39;s over-diagnosed and medications over-prescribed when non-pharmaceutical treatments (with little or no side-effects) have proven efficacy.</p>

<p>Eg. <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/174928.php">Saint John&#39;s Wort</a> (a herb) is prescribed in many European countries for treating mild to moderate depression, whilst in the US mainly ignored in favor of pharmaceuticals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At 26 I finally went to a psychiatrist. As a Hispanic, mental health issues are seen as a weakness. And you never seek help for them. I had come to the conclusion over the years that my &quot;train of thought&quot; was never linear and that it always took an exhausting amount of energy just to focus and hone in on the problem. My head was always all over the place and all my life I was called lazy for never following through my work. Focus, though a virtue for me, was just beyond my reach. </p>

<p>I started a prescription for Adderall and I wondered why the hell hadn&#39;t I been on this sooner. For me it was as if the noise of wandering thoughts finally went quiet and I finally was able to think &#39;cleanly&#39;. </p>

<p>While I agree some measure of discipline is appropriate, Rx treatment may be inevitable for some. I&#39;m an entirely better self because of it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not my diagnosis and my Rx is just another mineral I benefit from in my diet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are drugging you to fit into the current modern paradigm. Also, in the drug induced state you are less likely to question this paradigm.</p>

<p>This might give you some insight: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNE6PHCNdas">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNE6PHCNdas</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, though. Adderall only has a few side effects: fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeats; feeling light-headed, fainting; increased blood pressure (severe headache, blurred vision, trouble concentrating, chest pain, numbness, seizure); or tremor, restlessness, hallucinations, unusual behavior, or motor tics (muscle twitches); headache or dizziness; sleep problems (insomnia); dry mouth or an unpleasant taste in your mouth; diarrhea, constipation; loss of appetite, weight loss; or loss of interest in sex, impotence, or difficulty having an orgasm.
This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p>

<p>Struggling to focus? That&#39;s much worse than the dozen debilitating and life ruining side effects listed - NOT!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/attention-disorder-or-not-children-prescribed-pills-to-help-in-school.html?_r=0">Attention Disorder or Not, Pills to Help in School</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“My kids don’t want to take it, but I told them, ‘These are your grades when you’re taking it, this is when you don’t,’ and they understood,” Ms. Williams said, noting that Medicaid covers almost every penny of her doctor and prescription costs.</p>

<p>Some experts see little harm in a responsible physician using medications to help a struggling student. Other fear that doctors are exposing children to unwarranted physical and psychological risks. Reported side effects of the drugs have included growth suppression, increased blood pressure and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some people who believe adhd isnt a real thing, that they are just symptoms of other issues, such as anxiety disorders or lack of parental direction. </p>

<p>My brother was adhd as a kid, and they put him on meds. He turned into a zombie. Same with my sister and nephew. They did, however, do a little (only a little) better in school. So, to me, it seems thst the meds are for behavioral modification rather thsn helping the kids do better.</p>

<p>Personally, i can see how it is helpful for some. I just feel that, just like with almost every other med, adhd meds are overprescribed. Adhd is overdiagnosed. Its a lazy way of making your kid behave, even if they dont have adhd. </p>

<p>Big Pharma is probably one of the most evil entities in our government, and they dont care if people are wrongly being prescribed dangerously powerful meds when they dont need it. They care about the profits.</p>

<p>The school system is flawed, yes. But, the way i see it, these are two different issues that you are trying to lump together. With that said, i do think there are alternatives. Like you said, in school everyone is treated the same, for better of for worse. But no one learns exactly like another. Fix this, and maybe you can fix the overdiagnosing issue as well...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be so pessemistic but they don&#39;t give a rats ass about fixing any of the problems that blight our school systems.</p>

<p>I currently work in a school district and have previously worked in a different district.</p>

<p>The amount of waste on every level is absolutely absurd, it&#39;s astounding how much blatant waste there is.</p>

<p>Travelling teachers that require equipment moves half way through the year because the schools don&#39;t have permanent art/music supplies/teachers.</p>

<p>You think that&#39;s wasteful, but then it gets worse, because they have you bring one Yamaha Clavinova from Building A to B, and then the Yamaha Clavinova that was at Building B to A. It makes sense from the &quot;it&#39;s the keyboard I use so I know it&#39;s not damaged&quot; standpoint but not from a fiscal standpoint. Even the logic of &quot;It&#39;s mine so I know it works right&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense because they can&#39;t be sure other people don&#39;t tamper with it when they aren&#39;t there, and if they all keep their keyboards in excellent condition then there should be no worry using a different one because it should be just as operable.</p>

<p>Students throw out half of the food they&#39;re given without even opening the damn bag its&#39; in, and extra food just gets straight up thrown out, like entire crates of single pack yogurts that could easily be given to a food pantry.</p>

<p>The school system is absymally broken and all of this fucking common core bullshit is making everything even worse and more confused.</p>

<p>How do you address each students specific learning styles when you force them all to respond to materials in specific manners that make them comform to a certain way of thinking without consideration as to how the students even come to those conclusions which are basically being forced on them?</p>

<p>I cite the &quot;constitution outdated&quot; exercise that everybody, rightfully so, got up in arms about.</p>

<p>The school system is the reason why I&#39;m not great at math, because I learn differently than how they were trying to teach it, but all they see is &quot;he&#39;s not getting it&quot; so they threw me into LOW math which detrimented my mathematical development even more so, mother fuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I have a form of ADD too but I never took pills or got it diagnosed. I think  it stems from an unstable household. My parents are still together and their relationship is rather good, but my father used to be very unpredictable, and if your dad is like that when you are young I think it develops your mind with fear. Someone who is unpredictable  cannot just be approached, each time you do so you have a fear of what is going to happen this time. Is he going to turn around with irritation and yell? Or smile and be approachable?</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t count on my dad to react in the same way at all times, it&#39;s one of the reasons we are very distant from each other and will rarely touch each other. Its fucking tragic though cause if you think about it he probably himself has issues given to him by his family situation, he was born in a family of 13 people. He works on himself cause I used to curse him out and yell at him, all that stuff made me introspective and pretty good with behavioral analysis and psychological stuff, I would use nuggets of painful truth and hit him with it in an effort to make him conscious of his own behavior (which he wasn&#39;t at all). I can see the degree to which I myself am fucked up psychologically and it&#39;s so hard to change that conditioning, I believe its truly physically wired into you.</p>

<p>The only way to perhaps truly change it is to rewire yourself and that you can only do through contemplation and meditation for years and years. Doing this consistently however is difficult.</p>

<p>This is also why I hesitate to have children or why I have to work hard on myself before I ever have a kid. Because I know exactly what I will pass on to him if I don&#39;t work on these issues and the cycle would simply continue. The world we live in today however doesn&#39;t facilitate that kind of mental healing, there is no time for it, and the environment is one of toxicity, negativity and stress. No wonder people get mental breakdowns or go off the deep end. </p>

<p>Were we to live in an empathetic society, people with psychological issues would heal a lot faster, but for such a society to exist in the first place there would need to be psychologically healthy people, which almost don&#39;t exist today. Another thing working against us is that negativity perpetuates negativity, so the darker our society becomes the deeper we go into hell. You might think social healthcare and other social programs should be abolished and rather let everyone fend for themselves. The people who say this kind of stuff are usually the wealthy ones what they don&#39;t understand is that such a policy of ruthlessness would also affect them.</p>

<p>It would affect them indirectly but they would be too primitive minded to see the true reverberations of their childish ideas. I know social plans have a bad rep in America, but that&#39;s because you&#39;re implementing it badly. Social safety nets are required in some form or another if you want society to be peaceful, if you neglect the people who are not able to find their way in society than that will come back to bite you. And in America its easy to see that it DOES come back to bite you. The amount of crazy occurrences in America tops that of all wealthy societies in the world. I&#39;m not basing myself on any real statistics for this claim, but from my long time of following everything American (as is hard not to do on the internet ) I have come to that conclusion.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should just take the pills and forget about the complexity of life and just go with the masses, there is no reward in being different or in seeing the world in its true ugly form, you just end up hurting yourself while the rest have the luxury to live life with a sense of weightlessness. There is a reason why great people die early, it&#39;s because they get crushed by the weight of the world. Now I know it&#39;s a little bit corny and perhaps a way to justify and glorify my own condition as being superior to that of others, a way to make me feel good about feeling bad. </p>

<p>As a person you have to find balance in life, don&#39;t care too much about the world and about people, but don&#39;t care too little either. Any one who slides to one of these extremes will be mentally unhealthy, even the great &quot;humanitarians&quot; would do good to ground themselves a little before they go off on a rant. </p>

<p>Iv had experiences where I would see the world as being completely perfect, so peace CAN be achieved no matter how dark the world looks, it just gets harder to  achieve as you yourself grow older and the physical make-up of your brain less elastic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll reply to this because I&#39;m of a similar background, and its someting I&#39;ve thought about as time goes on. </p>

<p>My only theory on this is that trauma at a very young age causes the brain to change the way it uptakes information. We learn early the capacity of others to do harm and we change so that we can negate that. We look for hidden meanings and what is behind the front I suppose, in a way. To avoid what may be coming or the unstated intentions.</p>

<p>We&#39;re a minority but I don&#39;t necessarily view it as a negative or a bad perspective. I think were hard for people to deal with sometimes, but at the same time our view, our perspective is more of a tangible perspective. We don&#39;t base ourselves off of things just because thats what someone says. We know truth, and we know what is real and important in life. </p>

<p>If I had to endure to get this gift, then I suppose that was the plan for me all along. I don&#39;t regret being this way, I embrace it. </p>

<p>It sounds like you already know the circle stops with you. Live life brother, or sister. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ADD isn&#39;t a &quot;disorder&quot;. It doesn&#39;t exist. I&#39;ve been diagnosed with ADD in my teen years due to problems with my ability to concentrate and my low attention span. Didn&#39;t get medicated for it tho.</p>

<p>Then I started working as an electro-mechanical mounter. My job required a lot of attention span, double-checking and attention-to-detail. Obviously, I was close to being fired due to how many mistakes I used to make because of my attention span. </p>

<p>But I persevered. I kept trying. I really NEEDED that job. Somehow, I don&#39;t know how... Somehow, I stopped making mistakes. I improved my attention span. Basically, after about a year of persevering, my &quot;ADD&quot; disappeared. Completely. Without any medication.</p>

<p>I guess that when you find your livelihood threatened, you are able to adapt.</p>

<p>&quot;ADD&quot;, to me, seems like just a collection of personality traits extremely common to artistically-minded people. I am one of those people except I never cultivated any artistical talent and I ended up earning a living by working in production. Since I depended on that job, I &quot;grew out of&quot; ADD. If it was a real disorder, I wouldn&#39;t be able to just decide to stop having it, you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I cannot argue with your particular case, I think that it would do well to point out that individual cases cannot be blanket cases. I don&#39;t advocate medicating children, in their formative years especially, for something like ADD/ADHD, however, at almost 26, I as an adult have figured out that it might help with my scattered mind. I am not saying it will for sure fix it, but I am willing to try, because having the attention span of a fly is honestly quite problematic.</p>

<p>People want to blame other stuff for their short comings.  Parents want to coddle their children so they feel they can have meaning for life. So these disorders and diseases are made up as a distraction to real events that are happening right now. </p>

<p>So they label some silly trait kids have and parents are so preoccupied with it they dont focus on the future. They make it day to day as they say with their kid when if they would just stop and realize hey lets just see how this goes and say fuck society&#39;s labels on normal behavior. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that one before. It is an assumption that these people are &quot;in the dark&quot;, that they do not see what you (implied) are seeing. It elevates your own position above those who choose to help their children deal with their disorders. It&#39;s petty and weak tbh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[...] lets just see how this goes and say fuck society&#39;s labels on normal behavior.&quot;</p>

<p>I tried that. Didn&#39;t go so well. Still recovering from that. Bottom line is, if you need psychological help, please act on it. Not only ADD/ADHD or Aspergers, but depression as well. I ignored all of my problems and symptoms and all it did was destroy me even harder. You can&#39;t just say &quot;but these people are stupid, I know how to handle my problems!&quot;, because there&#39;ll already be a ton of symptoms that you seemingly can&#39;t handle well enough to live a normal life.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; ADD because it&#39;s trendy. I fucking hate it, and I hate depression. I didn&#39;t look at my friends and thought &quot;hey that&#39;s cool, I should try it as well!&quot; and made myself fucking miserable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sure some things are real but most isnt.&quot;</p>

<p>Another bullshit statement where you cover your ass with &quot;there may be some truth to it, but the majority isn&#39;t so I&#39;m still right!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really have no idea whatsoever what depression really is, right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to just scream &quot;get over it&quot; from the sideline, but someone who&#39;s depressed is often not capable of &quot;fixing&quot; itself, because this mechanism is broken. It requires a radical change in the thought patterns of the person, and that is something that even the most stable and rational people find difficult to do. The human mind hates change above all things. Be it change in behavior, change in personal opinions. Now imagine someone with serious problems dealing with their own stability and barely hanging on to regular life, and you expect them to just change by the snap of a finger? You have a lot of reading to do mate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was diagnosed with adhd in the early 90s when it was still new. They put me on Ritalin at first but I was later switched to myntaliphid or whatever it is called. I will agree it helped me focus although I dont fully understand why. But it has side effects for example. </p>

<p>Loss of appitite. Before I was a teenager eating everything and after a month or so of regular meds I lost around 25lbs. </p>

<p>Inability to care about anything. It is hard to explain really. It was like being a good soldier in the sense that I would do whatever was asked of me without question. </p>

<p>Inability to just let mind drift. Ok this one is a big one it bothered me the most and why I stopped taking it. Ok you have to imagine this cause I dont know if I can explain it well enough.</p>

<p>Before I started taking it I used to be very creative and deep thinking in projects. Once medicated it was exhausting to do mundane tasks such as cleaning house. I would concentrate on one thing at a time and would be unable to plan my next course of action. I had post it notes everywhere. When I would clean the house it was worse getting prepared for it then doing it.</p>

<p>I also lost my creative edge. Yeah my grades improved cause teachers wanted mindless sponges that didnt question the reasoning behind why the hell the earth tilts on an axis. They want to get thru their day just like anyone else that has a nine to five.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the teachers that do want to explain things are the good ones and their are less and less everyday. Look man bottom line is the choice is up to you if you want to start medicating or not.</p>

<p>Do it or dont but I can tell you this you will not be the same person. You will also not find conclusive evidence to prove that is is harmful. Just hearsay. All I know is that it didnt help me so I stopped taking it.</p>

Not to brag, just for perspective, but I&#39;m well in the 3 digit I.Q. and I never really did better than a C average in school. If I attended at all. </p>

<p>I&#39;m mixed on the scripts. As a philosophy I don&#39;t think I should be deliberatly changing my brain chemistry.. In all honesty its my view that psychology is really nothing more than a pseudoscience. None of this stuff is really measureable with provable correlations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, psychology is most definitely not a pseudoscience.</p>

<p>People think in certain ways, that is why advertising works. It uses psychological ploys to trick people into thinking whatever the desired though is be it &quot;I need this product to make this aspect of my life better&quot; or &quot;damn this is the best sub I&#39;ve ever had&quot;.</p>

<p>Did you ever wonder why Chipotle puts &quot;all natural&quot; &quot;so good&quot; &quot;tasty&quot; and other buzz words all over their bag?</p>

<p>So that every time you eat it and view the bag, you subliminally change your opinion about how good it is, usually with increasing ferver towards &quot;holy fuck chipotle is the best thing ever&quot;.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s one of the main reasons people treat it like the holy grail of burritos, that and how generally huge your chances of eating not great &quot;authentic&quot; Mexican, but again that all depends, every place is different, and that&#39;s what sets chipotle apart, standardization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll respond because I am prescribed and am currently on a psychotropic stimulant for the treatment of ADHD. 
First of all, ADD is not a thing anymore. They actually use ADHD or 3 different specific reasons now. </p>

<p>The biggest issue is, you have doctors prescribing young children with drugs they don&#39;t probably need. ADHD has become a catch-all diagnosis.
This mistreatment of an actual psychological disorder appalls me both as a psycho student and as a medical professional. 
Most children who get deemed ADHD are in fact just being a normal child. 
We&#39;ve fallen in to a society that depends so heavily on &quot;miracle drugs&quot; that we&#39;ve lost sight of our true behavior and nature. 
Girls are different, they&#39;re harder to catch because it presents itself differently and unfortunately a lot of the times girls aren&#39;t diagnosed early enough. 
The problem is you have parents who see a hyper child and automatically think &quot;ADHD.&quot;
This isn&#39;t always the case and diet should be checked before distributing medicines. 
You also have doctors who aren&#39;t specialists of behavioral health who deem it necessary to prescribe medication without first prescribing a visit with a psychologist. 
The last big thing is many people are attempting to get the drugs without actual need. This has become far too easy. 
There really should be stricter regulations on how they decide who gets these medications. They are Scheduled drugs after all.
The second point of posting this is to say, if you have a child I would hold off on medication an start first with conditioning and behavior modification. 
The younger the better. 
I am in my 20s and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 12. I didn&#39;t start medication until I was close to 18 and it&#39;s really something that does a number on your body. 
I have no appetite to the point where I will not eat for an entire day. The dehydration is terrible also as I am always thirsty no matter how much water I drink. I have an abundance of energy that half the time becomes nervous energy and then I sit and jitter. 
I will not go in to much further information now but I will say the side effects can be dangerous especially in children or those unfamiliar with their body&#39;s reaction to chemicals. 
Of all of the ADHD drugs I&#39;ve done legally or otherwise I would say adderall helps my condition the most but the side effects are terrible including cold sweats, mild confusion due to racing thoughts and an otherwise poor disposition. 
I now only take vyvanse when I work or go to school. For the most part I can function better without it but I just feel as if my brain and mind are foggy when I don&#39;t take it. 
And don&#39;t even get me started on the withdrawals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a couple psych classes in technical college and would have to say I agree with everything you say.  It really turned me off how my teachers referred to the DSM checklist and started about medications.  Then again it is a disorder for a lot of people in the sense that it can become detrimental to their lives.  I take Vyvanse myself and find it to be a miracle drug most days and has really helped improve my focus and work ethic.  All I&#39;m saying is it shouldn&#39;t be diagnosed on every kid who looks out the window during a lecture, but it shouldn&#39;t be dismissed as a serious issue for some others.  There does need to be a serious serious overhaul of our education system though.  K12 schools do stifle the brain of someone with that difference in cognition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate and holier than thou, huh?  And my length of stay here is somehow relevant? I&#39;ve been a very active participant of this sub and consider it home.  Mommy issues? Jesus fuck!  The fact that you need to bring up this irrelevant bullshit and lame insult speaks volumes to your position and credibility.  I&#39;m glad amphetamines have helped your condition.  They did not for me, and when given the opportunity to rock life without drugs, I take it every single time.  I don&#39;t consider the traits of ADHD to be a detriment.  As stated earlier, I surround myself with highly intelligent people that also exhibit symptoms of ADHD purposefully.  Most are very like minded and on a level that I do not often see with others who are not.  There is a social theory that evolutionarily speaking, ADHD was beneficial to early groups of people.  Children that were capable of thinking outside the box to solve large physical and social problems that the elders of the group could not solve no matter what.  I feel that medicating something so wonderful removes many of the great benefits.  Taking a large pro, and because it allows those affected to see clearly through the bullshit to not be affected by the mass brainwashing and control tactics.  Many great minds throughout history displayed signs of ADHD.  Ben Franklin, Edison, Tesla, I could go on and on.  They did not &quot;treat&quot; this as a disease.  Again, if it works for you, great.  I&#39;m happy for you.</p>

<p>I do know amphetamines have ruined a great many lives, and I hope you do not share their same fate.  Escalating from using prescribed tweak to crystal meth when the high doesn&#39;t seem to be quite enough anymore.  It is one of the drugs where tolerance builds very rapidly.  Requiring more and more and more.  Be safe.  Keep your eyes open.  Don&#39;t allow yourself to be taken over by a drug.</p>

<p>P.S. I&#39;ve upvoted your comments. Not pathetically downvoted because your drugged  feelings were hurt.</p>

<p>If they have this advantage, how come its labeled as a disorder?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your description of their behavior reads identical to the Wikipedia page, so i&#39;ll be using that as a reference. </p>

<p>The fact people with ADD can&#39;t focus on tasks that don&#39;t interest themselves is reason alone to consider it a disorder. Life involves all kinds of boring but important tasks, imagine not being able focus on them properly (For instance, driving).</p>

<p>Wiki also lists <em>&quot;Not seem to listen when spoken to&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Struggle to follow instructions&quot;</em> - How is someone that suffers from that going to fare in the workplace? Most jobs are boring so their condition puts them at a large disadvantage compared to someone else without that disorder. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could argue that add type people had an evolutionary advantage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if ADD were a favorable trait for potential partners - Given how debilitating ADD can be i&#39;d suggest it&#39;s a negative trait and would speculate that people with ADD are less likely to bear children compared to non-ADD people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and that&#39;s why its so prevalent today.</p>

<p>Or it&#39;s so prevalent today because the definitions of behavior that fall under ADD has changed over time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is I exhibit every single one of those symptoms on the Wiki page.  I went to a few psychologists when my parents divorced that all said I exhibit behavior consistent with ADD.  I never went to a psychiatrist, because my parents didn&#39;t believe in drugging their child.  It&#39;s a daily struggle, but I&#39;m proud I have overcome ADD through self discipline.  I&#39;m by no means perfect.  After all, I am surfing reddit when I could do something with better with my time.  I simple don&#39;t believe a pill is always the answer.  Only in extreme cases should that be a <em>last</em> resort, not the first solution.</p>

<p><em>Hypothetically.</em></p>

<p>But no measurement is actually made. Like the serotonergic theory of depression it is a &quot;useful metaphor&quot;, the chemical imbalance hypothesis is really an advertising and marketing meme that continues to be advanced as &quot;science fact&quot; by pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>The problem is that since there is no established verifiable chemical &quot;balance&quot; the notion of an &quot;imbalance&quot; is vapid &quot;jargon&quot; devoid of the actual substance that it artificially implies it has.</p>

<p>What this REALLY is, is just a return to the old &quot;humors&quot; theory -- just with fancier names attached to the chemicals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Educate yourself before posting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d suggest you do the same.  And remember reading Pharmaceutical commercials and brochures do not constitute &quot;education&quot;; they&#39;re &quot;marketing&quot;.</p>

<p>If Wellbutrin were called <em>&quot;Dr. Burroughs&#39; &amp; Wellcome&#39;s Mystical, but Patented, Herbal Medicinal Brominated Salt -- Guaronteeeeed to increase your intellectual focus&quot;</em> you&#39;d be more skeptical.  But since it&#39;s been sold to you over decades with an easy-to-digest &quot;sciency&quot; candy coating... you swallow it whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I cannot argue with your particular case, I think that it would do well to point out that individual cases cannot be blanket cases. I don&#39;t advocate medicating children, in their formative years especially, for something like ADD/ADHD, however, at almost 26, I as an adult have figured out that it might help with my scattered mind. I am not saying it will for sure fix it, but I am willing to try, because having the attention span of a fly is honestly quite problematic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. It pisses me off when people want to think this is an illness. It is a key to seeing things in a more analytic manner. Everyone wants to think it is bad but far from it. I have a job that lets me get all fucking adhd and I get paid well for it too. </p>

<p>The whole thing is you figure out a way to make it work for you. Dont just taken others word cause they went to school. It means nothing you will know your body better then anyone else</p>
