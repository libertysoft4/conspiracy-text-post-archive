<p>Edit: This post is late. If anyone sees it, downvote me and upvote the other post by Weedtastic. I&#39;m leaving this up for the little debate about Snowden being a black operative. I feel that the allegation was sufficiently debunked, so hopefully a few people who have questions about it will read the conversation below. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sources or anything? Sounds like another one of those edgy conspiracy theories. You want to be different from everyone else for the sake of being different. Sound about right?</p>

<p>The Snowden revelations have <em>validated</em> the conspiracy movement. More and more people are waking up and questioning status quo concepts. The CIA has had a long history of <em>suppressing</em> the conspiracy movement. The very first thing the CIA would do in this situation is plant stupid theories about Snowden to divide the conspiracy crowd so that they argue over made up bullshit instead of concentrating and pooling knowledge to educate and empower each other. </p>

<p>The mainstream media made him talked about. I dont trust any of it for that reason. Plus if he really had anything worth a shit or they suspected he did mother fucker would be dead or worse. And nothing would have been said. </p>

<p>The nsa has heaps of techs that just sit there eating hot pockets and masturbating to WoW toons and watch xena reruns. Do you for one second think they would have not noticed the nanosecond he started to dl shit?</p>

look at all these crazy leaks he is putting out.. how would some low level dude have all this..</p>

<p>and finally and best of yet.. look at the fact that MAINSTREAM MEDIA is saying he is just a whistleblower.. they want you to believe the narrative.. snowden is NOT a whistleblower.. well.. he is.. but working for the CIA...</p>

<p>how about someone find me anything on snowdens past.. i see nothing. no internet finger print.. the only thing about snowden online is &quot;WHISTLEBLOWER&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so its like jesus... a huge part missing in the middle...</p>

<p>&quot;As an adult, the former CIA employee has not left much of a digital trail on the Internet&quot;</p>

<p>FACT: Snowden is/was CIA
FACT: Mainstream media reported on him as being a whistleblower</p>

<p>I dont trust one thing the mainstream media puts out.. including &quot;snowden is nothing but a regular whistleblower&quot;</p>

<p>what is being released under snowdens name is shit that a regular low level guy would not have.. unless he is an operative with the job of being a &quot;whistleblower&quot; then called out as a traitor in order to freak real whistleblowers out..</p>

<p>the stuff we are hearing about and learing about is stuff we knew about in 2002 from other whistleblowers.. its old tech.. old news.. the stuff going on today is far more advanced and we wont hear about it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you revising anything you said or what? Can you condense this down into something a little more coherent? I remember the bulk of the mainstream media calling him a traitor, but I don&#39;t really see your point. You seem to be saying </p>

<ul>
<li><p>that he was called a whistleblower </p></li>
<li><p>that he was called a traitor. </p></li>

<p>For some reason, somewhere in those two opposing sentences, you find evidence that this is a CIA black op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>easy to understand...</p>

<p>they first call him a whistleblower.. so the world understands what a whistleblower is..</p>

<p>then they proceed to label him as a traitor.. to scare the shit out of real whistleblowers from coming forward</p>

<p>I have no evidence except that he 100% was CIA
and that booz allen hamilton is HEAVILY connected to the CIA and 99% of their work is within the federal government intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>I have seen no proof.. no evidence.. that this random dude with some random hot girlfriend in hawaii is just some magical whistleblower with a shit ton of TOP secret, high level clearance type information </p>

<p>Anyway, for both of you, I&#39;ll give you a few easy ways to familiarize yourself with the basics of the NSA leaks. It will only take about 4-6 hours. </p>

<p>1) Click here: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/">http://www.spiegel.de/international/</a> and scroll down about halfway on the right side, you&#39;ll see a few links about the NSA leaks. </p>

<p>2) 1 hour. You&#39;ll have to watch the entire thing though. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vILAlhwUgIU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vILAlhwUgIU</a></p>
