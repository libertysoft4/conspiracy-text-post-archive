    <div class="md"><p>I get your point. The shot that broke it&#39;s back may have been lucky, indeed.  But the fact is, the Arizona and 17 other ships were treated as bait that day.  2500 American soldiers lost their lives as a result.</p>

<p>Had the Arizona not exploded due to the lucky shot, the casualty numbers would more likely have been less than a 1/3 of the total outcome.  Also, the Arizona, like most of the other ships in the harbor might have been salvageable.  Hindsight is 20/20, but it can easily be seen that US military intelligence took a gamble on this day, hoping the collateral damage from the Japanese attack would be enough to inspire enough shock and public outrage to go to war, but not enough damage to ruin the long term chances of the pacific fleet.</p>

<p>In this light, I consider the attack and the Arizona all part of the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Japanese (and the US government who knew about the upcoming attack) got lucky at least twice if not more. </p>

<ol>
<li>If no lucky bomb, casualties are much lower.</li>
<li>They actually noticed the airplanes coming in, but mistakenly they thought they were Americans coming home.</li>
<li><p>They discovered a Japanese U-boat but no alarm was sounded.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s imagine that they have a 20-30 minutes warning and the Arizona doesn&#39;t sink. Casualties would have been most likely under 1000, and they would have inflicted great damage on the Japanese airplanes, and if they decide to follow them, maybe on some of the warships.</p>

<p>Imagine the headline:  US Navy successfully repel Japanese attack!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That fleet had been stationed in San Diego up until just a few months prior to the attack.</p>

<p>The movement of those ships to Pearl Harbor must have appeared to the Japanese, to be in preparation of upgrading the embargo to a blockade (which would have been an act of war).</p>

<p>So placing those ships in harms way while presenting a credible threat to the Japanese -- could very well have been a sacrifice of some of those ships.</p>

<p>You should be able to handle imagining unicorns before you try to conceptualize a terrorist group.</p>

<p>Then you should not form opinions on topics based purely in language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer to your questions are in the word I chose:</p>

<p>Empiricism.</p>

<p>My world view is based on things I choose to accept. The only difference between myself and the average person is that I know damned well that I&#39;m choosing my world view. Which brings me to fact selection. I&#39;m careful about what facts I accept and why I select them. The next concept would be &#39;correspondence theory&#39; with a nod to &#39;coherence theory.&#39;</p>

<p>The claim that Al Qaeda is a legal entity strikes me as retarded. Al Qaeda is an entity, but I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s a legal entity. Did Al Qaeda have to file forms? To what department did they submit the forms? Is there an official Al Qaeda tax ID number? Can we see their expense reports? Which departments recognize them as legal entities? No. Al Qaeda is not a legal entity. It&#39;s fictional, but it&#39;s not a legal entity. I don&#39;t think you know what a legal entity is.</p>

<p>I would, again, refer you to &#39;empiricism.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The answer to your questions are in the word I chose:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t ask you anything because I don&#39;t think that you can comprehend enough abstraction to teach.  Note the lack of question marks in my writing.  That&#39;s a rather silly way to flatter yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Empiricism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My world view is based on things I choose to accept. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The acceptance of a choice is based on things of your world view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only difference between myself and the average person is that I know damned well that I&#39;m choosing my world view. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing keeping you in the communal, collective school of fish is that you all believe the same fallacy about why you are different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which brings me to fact selection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should consider the importance of precision vs. accuracy.</p>

<p>When and why does slow and steady win the race?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The claim that Al Qaeda is a legal entity strikes me as retarded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you should brush up on the history of the organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Al Qaeda is an entity, but I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s a legal entity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a set of rules and directives with hierarchical and parallel execution.  Social organizations with interchangeable members are legal entities, corporations are another example.  These are abstract things which are therefore not tangible, so it&#39;s silly to reject them as <em>&#39;not real&#39;</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did Al Qaeda have to file forms? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would assume that activity coincides with requests for funding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To what department did they submit the forms?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The office of Bandar Bin Sultan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there an official Al Qaeda tax ID number?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that their jurisprudence follows such norms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we see their expense reports?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their financiers can.  You can say the same thing about any major company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which departments recognize them as legal entities?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DOD has described them as an entity in a legal context.</p>

<p>So do the people who pay them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. Al Qaeda is not a legal entity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure is shilly in here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s fictional, but it&#39;s not a legal entity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s where you confuse tangibility with existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think you know what a legal entity is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the definition.
A legal entity is a legal construct through which the law allows a group of natural persons to act as if they were a single person for certain purposes</p>

<p>The term does not refer to the recognition granted by specific legal systems.  It only refers to the idea in general.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think you have a very good grasp on the subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You paraphrased Animal Farm and think you made a point about geopolitics.  Now you are demanding proof of something that you don&#39;t understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would, again, refer you to &#39;empiricism.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t work for abstract things, <strong>intrinsically.</strong></p>

<p>But I imagine that materialism gives you necessary advantage to lead the school of fish.  Just remember that you all happen to be making the same choice because it has been decided for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Al Qaeda fails much more often than it succeeds everywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Al Qaeda failed badly the first time it tried to blow up the WTC. </p>

<p>Al Qaeda has tried to blow up planes coming into America in 1995 (the &quot;Bojinka Plot&quot;), 2001 (the &quot;Shoe Bomber&quot;), 2006 (the &quot;liquid bomb&quot; plot that started the TSA&#39;s &quot;War on Moisture&quot;), 2009 (the &quot;Underwear Bomber&quot;), and 2010 (the &quot;printer cartridge&quot; bombs).</p>

<p>They sent a guy to the US to hijack a Propane truck to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge, he decided he liked Americans better than Al Qaeda and defected.</p>

<p>The attack on the USS Cole was a second attempt, the first time they tried it with the USS The Sullivans the boat sank.</p>

<p>This is just a handfull of their failures, try googling &quot;failed Al Qaeda plots&quot; for dozens more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Al-Quaeda is a fake organisation propagated by the Western media.             </p>

<p>Sure, terrorists exist. Or should I call them freedom-fighters trying desperately to repel foreign invaders?               </p>

<p>But the truth of the matter is that Al-Quaeda (as a global terrorist organisation) is a propaganda meme designed to instil fear in western voters, in order to create support for illegal wars in Islamic countries who are trying to resist the corporate paradigm.                     </p>

<p>The Israeli regime is the foremost proponent and designer of this propaganda.<br/>
Therefore, it makes perfect sense that the creators of this fugazzi would deem their own territory off-limits for these fake terror attacks.                 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say Al-qaida doesn&#39;t exist though, I think it exists but it&#39;s completely organized and made by the Mossad. They recruit young impressionable minds and nudge them to do things. This kind of organization isn&#39;t limited to one group though, they do this across the world and give the impression of organized groups. In Russia you have the Chechens, in China you will have the Uyghur terrorist. Uyghur people are Turks who live in China, they are obviously a minority group which combined with their Arab heritage gives them the perfect MO for a terrorist group.</p>

<p>The attacks on tiananmen square  are just the beginning of their operations in China. Israel is demonozing Arabs en mass, because who hates the Arabs more than the Zionist pigs? Well it seems now most of the world hates them, and guess why? </p>

<p>If you understand where Jihad comes from it makes zero sense for them to go after the targets they are going after. But they want you to believe that terrorists indiscriminately bomb everyone across the world because of some insane drive to kill all non believers, which isn&#39;t at all true and isn&#39;t at all what Jihad means. </p>

<p>The Yemeni hospital massacre for example is a complete setup. No practicing Muslim would ever do that in the name of Allah. But you go on the internet and look for the videos of the massacre and you will see a whole list of comments damning the Muslims into hell. Even Arabs fall for it and they start to become disgusted with Islam because they don&#39;t agree with the incredible disgusting things that are done in their name.</p>

<p>What they don&#39;t understand is that these attacks not only divide the world against the Arabs, but it divides the Arabs among themselves. It creates &quot;extremists&quot; and &quot;moderates&quot;. The &quot;extremists&quot; are those who do not fear to fight the NWO, the moderates are those who conform to western culture and practice Islam in a mostly passive and symbolic manner. They will never stand up for injustice because they are afraid to be labeled terrorists. In essence they will be passified in much the same way as the west is passified into inaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with almost everything you&#39;ve said.<br/>
Al-Quaeda, as depicted by the MSM does not exist.<br/>
It&#39;s used as a catch-all term for all Islamic resistance groups that have sprung up post 9/11.<br/>
Hezbollah, Hamas, Fatah, Muslim Brotherhood et al cannot be clumped together by western MSM because they obviously existed as seperate entities long before Al-Quaeda was ever reported on.             </p>

<p>Even the term &#39;Al-Quaeda&#39; itself was a CIA creation used to describe the Afghani mujaheddin that were supplied and trained by the CIA to fight the Soviet occupation of their country.<br/>
Post 9/11, this term was co-opted to describe a non-homogenous group that conveniently could be blamed for the attacks that happened on that day.                </p>

<p>Although, your opinion on the &#39;Tiananmen Square Massacre ™&#39; is one I&#39;ve never heard before.<br/>
Not saying you&#39;re wrong, but does any evidence exist that can point to there being an Islamic element in this event? Whether a genuine attempt at resistance or one created by CIA/Mossad.                </p>

<p>edit: I also do agree that many so-called Islamic jihadists are created and funded by western intelligence agencies using naive and idealistic patsies.<br/>
And I agree that many so-called terrorist attacks are not perpetrated by Islamic jihadists at all. These attacks are performed by the CIA/Mossad/MI6 et cetera and then dressed up to look like they were performed by Muslims. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/tiananmen-square-incident-planned-since-september-report/1781981.html">News Link</a></p>

<p>Note especially this : &quot;The CCTV report, however, said the Tiananmen plotters decided to form a terrorist group only last month.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a setup by the same people that are known for this imo. I guess it could be argued that China is taking it&#39;s first steps into false flag to perpetuate an agenda. That&#39;s how its being portrayed by some media, but knowing the Chinese I don&#39;t think this is the case, this is clearly Mossad. Remember the Zionists are making their &quot;pivot&quot; to China, so my guess is you will be seeing a lot more attacks like this.</p>

But again, I agree with you. And seeing as this Tiananmen event is different to the one I thought you were referring to, I agree with you entirely this time.                 </p>

<p>9/11 was a poisoned chalice for the western elite.<br/>
Sure, they achieved many long-standing goals following this event. But, it woke millions of people up to the reality of their deeds.<br/>
I&#39;d hazard a guess that many within their ranks are angry at the exposure it&#39;s brought them. And Pandora&#39;s box has now been irretrievably opened.               </p>

    <div class="md"><p>man we all know the us owns alqueda. alqueda also just happened to invade syria as they decided against central banking.</p>

<p>what we need to do is compile ways of spreading conspiracies and focusing on a few big undeniable ones. that way shills will be destroyed by our unity guy. If we each day/week focus on one conspiracy to spread with undeniable proof then anyone against it will therefore have to employ much larger resources to deny it. Hopefully making reddit focus on the topics.</p>

<p>we keep posting info to each other only which keeps it from spreading as fast.
We need to prioritize information, then uniformly administer it to others. Even if we focus on one subreddit at a time, this subreddit will grow and our resources aswell. But we also have to follow rules, each conspiracy has a section it would apply to, UFO, science, health, politics, money, spirituality, aliens, technology(tesla), so on. </p>

<p>and if we do it with only the information each of us ACTUALLY KNOWS then we can fend of shills quite easily.</p>

<p>even if you dont agree with what i say, if anyone has a better plan then by all means go ahead. Id like to know if you guys would actually be interested in doing something like this. so ifso comment give an idea even if it isnt mine some popularity. </p>

<p>If we can get people who know whats going on more so in their feild applying it to the conspiracy, then more loose ends get fixed. and more people feel obligated to make things better.</p>

<p>In it he implies that Al Qaeda as a hierarchical organization with international cells (the bogeyman summoned by the neo-cons) does not exist, but it is still a flag for Jihadists and Islamists, an ideology. And of course while not discussed in the article, once such flag is rised by any group, funding starts pouring in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, not a a single jihadist group proclaims themselves to be a part of &#39;Al-Quaeda&#39;.<br/>
This is a tag forced upon them by western MSM.<br/>
Each and every resistance group has a separate identity driven by their own grievances.                  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Islamic terrorists don&#39;t exist, and I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t a threat to western society.<br/>
But, the idea that there is a global terrorist group with cells around the world plotting coordinated attacks is the biggest crock of shit ever perpetrated and consumed en masse by uninformed and gullible westerners.<br/>
Second only to the Cold War lie.<br/>
And, practically all of these jihadists exist only because of the misdeeds/crimes of our governments abuses of their human rights.                        </p>

<p>&quot;If you illegally invade another country, bomb the shit out it and then indiscriminately kill innocent civilians, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time..&quot;              </p>

<p>But this is what our elite wants. Perpetual war. And the ability to propagandise the need for perpetual war.<br/>
Just like the War on Drugs. It can never be won, and the &#39;enemy&#39; can never be defeated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that they control the governments of the US and Canada.<br/>
But I vehemently disagree that we&#39;re doomed.<br/>
Global support for Israel is rapidly diminishing.<br/>
Without US support militarily and in the UN, they would be fucked.               </p>

<p>And one only has to look at the recent refusal of the British Parliament to join the &#39;coalition of the willing&#39; in attacking Syria, and then the US choosing to try to make peace with Iran as a sign that their is influence is definitely on the wain.                 </p>

<p>Everyone now accepts that the leaders of Israel are insane, bloodthirsty and racist psychos.<br/>
Unless you&#39;re a Zionist or are being paid to trumpet their ideology, then it&#39;s hard to find anyone who supports their stance.<br/>
Everyone knows they&#39;re war criminals with no respect for international law or the rights of non-Jews.<br/>
And everyone, who&#39;s not a shill, condemns Israeli settlements.<br/>
Israel has defied more UN resolutions than every other country put together.<br/>
Everyone knows the truth, but change is always difficult.               </p>

<p>edit: This is not a complaint against Judaism. I hold Judaism in the same regard that I hold Christianity, Islam and all other religions. They&#39;re all full of shit and are simply archaic forms of peer-pressure and mind control of the unenlightened.<br/>
What I have a problem with is Zionism.<br/>
A demonstrably racist ideology writ large.                   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I was wondering if someone was going to call racist on me.  </p>

<p>It also needs to be said that like most countries, the actions of the government don&#39;t necessarily reflect the will of the people, although they might.  I just don&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>In Canada the opinion of the majority doesn&#39;t effect the actions of the government.  I think that can be said for most modern governments.  Even if it did, public opinion is easily swayed the propaganda put out by our media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AQ isn&#39;t the &quot;defender of all things muslim&quot;, they are a descriptive term used to label the loosely connected sunni muslim militias that wreak havoc in the middle east.  Their primary goal seems to be unseating shiite backed governments.  It seems pretty clear that most of these militias are funded by Saudi and Western backed interests because the Shiites are doing business with Russia and China. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Not at all.</p>

<p>Al-Quaida is not ideological. They are sold as such, but they are not interested in ideology. It is as much a tool to them as it is to whoever plays them as the Great Satan to be destroyed to save everyone from Terrorism.</p>

<p>They take over a village and say that the infidels will be purged, extract tributes from the population, and leave a local presence to crush any dissent under the guise of Sharia. In Afghanistan I can only assume it&#39;s like a circlejerk, where the American army fucks shit up, then they say it is all their fault, then they fuck shit up, then the area gets re-taken, and so on. Nobody wins there. But they both reinforce the &quot;Great Enemy&quot; lie.</p>

<p>Al Quaida, in short, is interested in money, and attacking Israel would be financial suicide, as any local operatives would be ruthlessly disposed of and would bring them &quot;attention&quot; that they would rather avoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the blowback from their support of ISIS and related groups in Syria.</p>

<p>Support like that, with Iran as a common enemy, is the reason that Israel tends to be more threatened/endangered by extremists other than Al-Qaeda.  Hezbollah and Hamas are more typically the terrorists who threaten Israel.  I&#39;m surprised no one has pointed out the comparative weakness of the threat of Al-Qaeda to Israel as opposed to their older and more established enemies.  In the worst case scenario, it looks like the Israeli government is abusing the peace process to pit enemies against each other; while hoping to acquire territory in the wake of violence instigated.  That would be consistent with some of the worse rumors I have heard about &#39;Eretz Israel&#39; and crass expansionist plans.  It&#39;s a convoluted situation where you can&#39;t ascribe malice to an entire group.  However, it would be madness to deny that there is a wingnut portion of Zionist policymakers who will expand Israel by any means necessary.  </p>

<p>From an outsider perspective, it looks like there is a  very unpopular group with a very secure hold on power, and that group is making deals to further its own interest at the expense of the common good.  It is blatantly obvious to see that support of Sunni extremism in Syria would create dangerous links between Hamas and Al-Qaeda.  The only way that I can reconcile smart Israelis making such a stupid move, is by attributing the mistake to a fanatical subgroup that is abusing power for its own ends.  </p>

<p>Have the &quot;descendants of Jacob/ Israel&quot; fulfilled their end of the bargain, or not?</p>

<p>If not, it would seem like retaking &quot;the Promised Land&quot; by cunning, force and deception would fly in the face of their &quot;contract&quot; with &quot;The Lord&quot;, no?</p>

<p>Sounds like risky business.</p>

<p>That has yet to be seen. Especially since hamas is training teens to die from drone strikes and air strikes.

<p>In it he implies that Al Qaeda as a hierarchical organization with international cells (the bogeyman summoned by the neo-cons) does not exist, but it is still a flag for Jihadists and Islamists, an ideology. And of course while not discussed in the article, once such flag is rised by any group, funding starts pouring in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your point. The shot that broke it&#39;s back may have been lucky, indeed.  But the fact is, the Arizona and 17 other ships were treated as bait that day.  2500 American soldiers lost their lives as a result.</p>

<p>Had the Arizona not exploded due to the lucky shot, the casualty numbers would more likely have been less than a 1/3 of the total outcome.  Also, the Arizona, like most of the other ships in the harbor might have been salvageable.  Hindsight is 20/20, but it can easily be seen that US military intelligence took a gamble on this day, hoping the collateral damage from the Japanese attack would be enough to inspire enough shock and public outrage to go to war, but not enough damage to ruin the long term chances of the pacific fleet.</p>

<p>In this light, I consider the attack and the Arizona all part of the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, not a a single jihadist group proclaims themselves to be a part of &#39;Al-Quaeda&#39;.<br/>
This is a tag forced upon them by western MSM.<br/>
Each and every resistance group has a separate identity driven by their own grievances.                  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Islamic terrorists don&#39;t exist, and I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t a threat to western society.<br/>
But, the idea that there is a global terrorist group with cells around the world plotting coordinated attacks is the biggest crock of shit ever perpetrated and consumed en masse by uninformed and gullible westerners.<br/>
Second only to the Cold War lie.<br/>
And, practically all of these jihadists exist only because of the misdeeds/crimes of our governments abuses of their human rights.                        </p>

<p>&quot;If you illegally invade another country, bomb the shit out it and then indiscriminately kill innocent civilians, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time..&quot;              </p>

<p>But this is what our elite wants. Perpetual war. And the ability to propagandise the need for perpetual war.<br/>
Just like the War on Drugs. It can never be won, and the &#39;enemy&#39; can never be defeated. </p>
