<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vg3mk/rconspiracy_moderator_9000sins_has_been/">The attack in question</a></p>

<p>Now, I almost never post here on r/Conspiracy, even though this subreddit is a huge part of my life; I feel like in my current position I wouldn&#39;t provide much content by commenting and posting.</p>

<p>Expect for today, this is outrageous! I love this subreddit and I hate to see it come under attack like this..</p>

<p>9000sins was obviously set-up, but not on a minuscule level..  This was a Child Porn set-up, this could spell massive trouble for him, and for any other Mods and Users that are at possible risk of this same type of set-up!</p>

<p>We need to crack-down on this case immediately, please r/Conspiracy, we need to be prepared for more of this.</p>

<p>Edit: 9000sins seems to have been un-shadowbanned. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nOsecmL.jpg">Proof from Juniorstayawake</a> </p>

<p>Edit2: A Mod post from the comments about 9000sins being shadowbanned.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vg3mk/rconspiracy_moderator_9000sins_has_been/ces5662">Mods underattack?</a></p>

<p>Edit3: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vg3mk/rconspiracy_moderator_9000sins_has_been/cesfxme?context=3">Strange behavior from 9000sin&#39;s account could indicate someone other then the real 9000sins is under control of the account.</a></p>

<p>Edit4: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vhu1s/the_day_of_9000sins/ceshenn">&#39;&quot;He claims his account was not hijacked and the admins clearly felt the post was not CP as they overturned the shadowban. So that&#39;s that. Was a weird situation though.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Edit5: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1viy07/so_i_was_shadowbanned_and_a_lot_of_you_have/">Everything has been cleared up here by 9000sins.</a></p>

<p>Maybe you should post your explanation here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before this gets worse. And the further this continues the further subredditdrama and conspiratards will be trolling harder, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> more paranoid.</p>

<p>Why are there no attacks on him? It seems extremely targeted. This is worse then a goddamn soap opera in here I member when it was about conspiracy and not about mod drama. Screw their drama it dont matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t trying to say anything about your online activity, but it was just very odd yesterday, when you popped into the thread, without any &quot;official&quot; statement. Both Poythress and I were speculating if you had been hacked. </p>

<p>I see no reason to dox yourself, unless in danger? You&#39;re going to get enough trolls from this &quot;publicity&quot; already. Without having viewed the image, I can&#39;t make an assertion that you did anything &quot;wrong&quot;. It was both very witchhunty and overly defensive behavior on the part of this sub, myself included. </p>

<p>Congrats on fatherhood. Enjoy that crazy special time before they learn to crawl,are still snuggly butts and haven&#39;t learned &quot;No&quot; and &quot;why?&quot; yet! ;) </p>
