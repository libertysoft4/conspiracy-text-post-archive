<p>For example this article on the French study which suggested Monsanto&#39;s GMO corn caused cancer in rats:</p>

<p>While this list is limited to this reddit I would also like to point out this does happen in some other reddits as well (not all) even ones that are supposedly any thing goes </p>

<p>here’s an old study on this line of rats published in 1979 that looked at the spontaneous development of endocrine tumors. After two years, 86% of male and 72% of female rats had developed tumors of the sort described by Séralini et al. Note that the time period of this 1979 study was the same as that of Séralini et al, two years. In other words, the “treated” rats developed as many tumors as expected for this particular strain of rats allowed to live to their natural lifespanand in fact the control groups arguably had an unusually low incidence of tumors.</p>

<p><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2012/09/24/bad-science-on-gmos-it-reminds-me-of-the-antivaccine-movement/">Several study links supporting those statements can be found here, as well as a good breakdown of why the study is generally bullshit and horribly constructed</a>. Basically, the study itself was flawed by having too many experimental factors, and far too small a population for each experimental factor, and not controlling for known faults in the chosen experiment subjects that should counsel for the use of other subjects, especially when testing for tumor formation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/politicbot is a bot which resubmits all posts from political subreddits to r/politic.<br/>
u/go1dfish created it as an alternative to r/politics  </p>

<p>I think you are confusing that bot with his other bot - u/moderationlog which scans the new queues of various political subreddits periodically to check which posts are removed. Posts which it discovers have been removed are logged at r/moderationlog. Only that bot can submit to r/moderationlog, users however can submit removals to r/politicalmoderation. Sometimes for example, I browse r/moderationlog and any removals I find interesting, I will resubmit them to r/politicalmoderation to highlight them and/or for potential discussion. This is the intention of the two subreddits.</p>

<p>I believe u/politicbot resubmits even the removed posts to r/politic also.</p>

<p>this bot just copies any submission to a subreddit that is also parsed by the moderationbot by submitting it to <a href="/r/politic">/r/politic</a>. that <strong>does not</strong> mean that everyone of these posts has been removed/moderated. these you can find under <a href="/r/moderationlog">/r/moderationlog</a>.</p>

<p>furthermore, after a quick glance at some of the articles in your list, this alexander higgins seems to mostly get by on linkjacked content, just like washington&#39;s blog, which is a &quot;don&#39;t&quot; according to the rediquette.</p>

We don&#39;t seem to use the same reasoning when something appears to support conspiracy positions, or ideologies. There isn&#39;t anything even interesting in the supposed interview, that would get it removed from reddit. Wow, he was, &#39;allegedly&#39; helping to build a road. Man that is some interesting intel right there! I can see why illuminati of reddit would want it removed! </p>
