<p>I often feel, as I would think many of you feel, helpless and infuriated the more and more I learn about what is <em>actually</em> going on in the world, and most of the time I just don&#39;t know how to deal with it. It seems more and more like it&#39;s too far gone (at least here in America) for this regime to fall. I often &quot;zone out&quot; in video games, sleeping, movies, hanging out with friends, or just anything to not think about it. Is there anything else one can do? Are there any things that you tell yourself or do that help you find solace in the current state of our planet? What the fuck can we do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I educate people in my sphere in only small doses.  They do not like to be overwhelmed.  I learned that the hard way because I think I might have made them turn to liquor more often.  They drink a lot.  But I think things do start to get better as we age.  There are many stages in waking up.  I got over my shock/hopeless state.  It mainly had to do with me boycotting big corporations.  I buy food from the farmers market which is healthier for you so I feel better.  Another way I got over my hopeless stage is by turning to religion.  If you look and read into all the monotheistic religion descriptions of the end times, they mimic what we see today.  So, I feel even though things are bad, in the end God will bring justice.  Evil is going down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a rifle and chainsaw.  The world can burn for all I give a fuck.  That being said, it&#39;s important to think critically about what&#39;s going on in the world.  Once you understand what is going on, you should feel angry whenever the mainstream media treats you like a retard.  Educate people in your sphere.  You should only do so in small doses, people get overwhelmed, if you blast them with things like the creation of the FED, global corporations funding super PAC&#39;s, etc...  You probably feel despair  because you feel alone in your knowledge within your sphere.</p>

<p>This logic always escapes me. If the entire country goes to hell and chaos, what makes you think that you&#39;ll escape?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If nukes and all hell broke loose, nearly everyone on the entire planet would be gone. I don&#39;t know why you think you&#39;re safe because you live in the middle of no where.</p>

<p>Your logic did escape me, you are under the belief that you know that you&#39;d be fine because of where you are, right? In case you didn&#39;t realize, I did ask you a question in my post, saying &quot;What makes you think you&#39;ll escape?&quot; Your post and subsequent reply implies that because you&#39;re so off the grid you&#39;d be fine. I don&#39;t know why you think that would save you if a mass takeover of the entire country or a global meltdown with nukes blasting. </p>

<p>My question of logic is to saying &quot;the world can burn for all I give a fuck&quot; - no reason to be defensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What have I said that is indicative of me watching too many movies? Because I point out that if literally all hell breaks loose across the entire globe, that assuming because you&#39;re in the middle of no where, or because you&#39;re &quot;prepared&quot; that you&#39;d be fine? </p>

<p>So, there&#39;s that..</p>

<p>Finally, I didn&#39;t say that I would be safe.</p>

<p>This is what my only question was; and anything else you&#39;ve said has been either off-topic, or lightly insulting me. All I said is, why say you want the world to burn, if you&#39;re not even sure you&#39;d escape it? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know you or where you live, but you seem to assume that whatever skill sets that you possess are the same for every other person around.</p>

<p>How exactly have I said this? Or what have I said that creates this assumption?</p>

<p>You straight up just said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world can burn for all I give a fuck.</p>

<p>How on Earth am I in the wrong to assume the <strong>worst possible scenario</strong> from your dialect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.&quot;but think in some sort of book of eli scenario where they are the one of the only ones out of billions who survives&quot;
2. I didn&#39;t say I want the world to burn.  I said I couldn&#39;t give a fuck if it does.  I wouldn&#39;t miss Kim Cardashian, McDonalds, Walmart, Honey Boo Boo, etc... If I didn&#39;t escape whatever end of the world &quot;Book of Eli&quot; scenario that you have cooked up in your mind, then okay.  If you want to know what the end of the world will really look like after war and economic collapse, drive through Kabul sometime.<br/>
3.  You seem to assume that because you would be fucked, that everybody would be fucked.  There are a lot of people who would die off. walk through Walmart and take a look.  If they weigh five hundred pounds, and are rolling around in an electric shopping cart, they probably don&#39;t have the necessary skill sets to survive. Maybe your one of those, I don&#39;t know.   There are also a lot of people who would do just fine.  To assume that just because you couldn&#39;t make it, that nobody could is just silly.
4.  I don&#39;t want to discuss this any further with you.  If your scared shitless of what is coming, deal with it.  I might live, I might die, maybe nothing will happen for the next 100 years.  It is what it is.  If something does happen though, I can&#39;t control it.  What I can control is that I own a chainsaw and a rifle.  The rest of the world can fend for itself.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstood my comment. I&#39;m saying the exact opposite of that, I&#39;m saying <em>other</em> people watch too many movies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I didn&#39;t escape whatever end of the world &quot;Book of Eli&quot; scenario that you have cooked up in your mind, then okay.</p>

<p>See above here...</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the world burning though.</p>

<li>You seem to assume that because you would be fucked, that everybody would be fucked.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What? When did I say I&#39;d be fucked? You&#39;re honestly just jumping to conclusions with every single point you make and you&#39;re just putting words in my mouth and arguing <em>those</em> words, and ignoring what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe your one of those, I don&#39;t know. There are also a lot of people who would do just fine. To assume that just because you couldn&#39;t make it, that nobody could is just silly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know what is the epitome of silly? What you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re fabricating things I haven&#39;t said and pinning those things against me, it&#39;s abhorrently stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the only thing you&#39;ve said that I agree with, outside of the fact that I am not scared what-so-ever.</p>

<p>In the next 30 days I won&#39;t be in the country, even if something happened in the next 30 days, I&#39;d be more than fine. I live in the near perfect example of off the grid.</p>

<p>I&#39;m perfectly fine if you don&#39;t want to discuss something, but please don&#39;t put words in my mouth and make little jabs at me insulting me along the way. I asked you a question, and yet you quietly insult me the whole time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think so much of the information about what is going on is getting out to us right now? Because once they discovered they could not directly censor the internet (yet), they moved on to ensuring we were all either angry or afraid. </p>

<p>We live in a duality. With every evil comes the opportunity for good. Don&#39;t focus on what is becoming increasingly evil in this world. Watch for it, understand it, but don&#39;t make it your focus. Our focus should be on unconditional personal responsibility. We are on this planet to learn responsible freedom of self-determination. To become truly self-confident and free to unconditionally be responsible for one&#39;s self, without being coerced to accept some higher authority. If we allow ourselves to be driven by anything less we are accepting the extinction of our humanity. </p>

<p>All change starts at our core. When we change what we are, and grow into something new, it manifests a new reality around us. Be the change you want to see. </p>

The guiding principal is &quot;small victories&quot;. You are in a lose-lose situation. It&#39;s a forgone conclusion the enemy will prevail. But even if you are losing the war you can win a battle here and there. It will keep you going. Convince one person who&#39;s opinion matters to you. Boycott one corporation. Attend one protest.

    <div class="md"><p>what we should all do is to learn to meditate..thats the only way we can ascend our consciousness to a higher level(which they dont want) which is what 12/21/2012 is really about: the new awakening...you can youtube on how to meditate..but for starters close your eyes and imagine the spatial perception you have of the blackness goes on for infinity..its tricky...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My literary agent’s husband works for Fox or some shit</p>

<p>I wouldn’t trust me a lot</p>

<p>Yo but trust me a little, I’m Malcolm Little, proud</p>

<p>Young riddle-me-this type</p>

<p>Black on white knife to fist fight</p>

<p>I’m at the People’s Temple reaching for that purple stuff</p>

<p>Kool A.D., you can call me &quot;Kool Purple Stuff&quot;</p>

<p>Brian Jones couldn’t massacre half as raw</p>

<p>Nah, my math is off</p>

<p>Cop me a calculator plus a spaceship, I’m blasting off</p>

<p>Drunk on Youtube, Hasselhoff</p>

<p>I’m signing autographs for German rap fans with flash cams taking snaps of my rap hands</p>

<p>I’m ham-handedly grabbing the cash as fast as I can</p>

<p>I don’t even know how long it’ll last, man</p>

<p>This too shall pass and that too shall pass</p>

<p>Party at the crossroads is over, but yo yo</p>

<p>Yo yo yo yo yo yo</p>

<p>After the party it’s the afterparty</p>

<p>The revolution probably won’t be sponsored by Bacardi</p>

<p>Be gnarly, Gs sounding like lasagna when I puff the Bob Marley</p>

<p>See me eating, but starving</p>

<p>A parvin, I mean a parmesan sandwich, I mean a Spartan</p>

<p>That’s exactly no aspersion, yeah</p>

<p>An arc or a curve in a chart upwards</p>

<p>My heart is a starfish, enough words</p>

<p>Starman but I strut earth</p>

<p>This logic always escapes me. If the entire country goes to hell and chaos, what makes you think that you&#39;ll escape?</p>

<p>Everyone seems to parrot this idea but think in some sort of book of eli scenario where they are the one of the only ones out of billions who survives.</p>
