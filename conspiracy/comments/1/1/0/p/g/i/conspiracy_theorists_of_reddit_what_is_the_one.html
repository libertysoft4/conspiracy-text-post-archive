        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t want this to turn into a bashing of any one conspiracy theory or anything like that. I just want to know your own opinion of a conspiracy theory that you have researched and said, &quot;ok, this is a little out there for me.&quot; I have been exposed to lots of different conspiracy theories and enjoy most of them regardless if I believe them or not. The one conspiracy theory that I cannot take seriously, no matter how it is presented to me, is reptilian shape shifters. I totally believe in aliens and that maybe they have influence over earth. I just have a hard time thinking people have access to the detailed information of a reptoid alien that is controlling the NWO. This might not be a popular opinion here but I just want to see how others view different conspiracy theories. If you think you have some information that would change my mind, I encourage it. 
Edit: I am loving the discussion but please don&#39;t downvote people you disagree with. Instead maybe reply and start a discussion on why they believe that. We are better than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall an AMA post of a guy who worked in Area 51. One of the top voted questions was something like &quot;<em>What is the one thing you know that most blows your mind</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>His answer was &quot;<em>The fact that the Moon is at the perfect distance to both exactly cover the Sun in a solar eclipse and for the Earth&#39;s shadow to exactly cover it in a lunar eclipse</em>.&quot; He went on to explain that the odds of this reality are beyond absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Los Luna is an artificial body than surely someone has to know how it got there. As for the no proof statement, It&#39;s ridiculous to claim there&#39;s no proof simply because you haven&#39;t been presented with any. An analogy to gravity, we have no idea what it is. A graviton particle, a wave? We don&#39;t know but we can measure the effect it has by throwing a 2x4 in the air and watching come down and busting our face open. Then claim it doesn&#39;t exist because we have no proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you explain what consciousness is then based on your scientific approach and provide the math behind it or possibly present some other info? We have it, we are aware of it, but no one knows why we&#39;re conscious. Sure, we can study the result of it, but that&#39;s only half of it. The moon isn&#39;t artificial in my opinion. We can measure it, but that may not answer all the questions. No one knows why or how the pyramids were built. They exist, but that&#39;s all we know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consciousness? Now there is one good question. Who said my approach was empirically scientific or mathematical? As Einstein said &quot;Science without religion is lame, Religion without science is blind.&quot; As far as we can tell there are at least 3 forms of consciousness, the &quot;regular&quot; waking type, subconscious, and superconscious. I suggest researching the &quot;100th monkey concept&quot; to see how we&#39;re all linked on a higher superconscious level. As to why, I would say there is none, absolutely zero reason UNTIL you take initiative and give it a why. You just had to bring up pyramids didn&#39;t you?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll assume by pyramids your speaking about the &quot;Giza complex&quot;, which are clearly designed and did not randomly manifest themselves on this planet. Therefore we can reasonably assume that someone somewhere, knows both exactly how and why they came to be. This is why the term UFO is insufficient, if a flying machine is under intelligent control (which they certainly appear to be), then they are absolutely &quot;Identified&quot;. Then the question is, who exactly can identify them? Back to Giza, I suggest watching &quot;Carl Munck&#39;s The Code&quot; for anyone who thinks the complex was built by ignorant, barbaric, slaves with hand tools. The &quot;Great&quot; &quot;Khufu&quot; or &quot;Cheops&quot; pyramid has the ratio of earth and moon, also Pi, Phi (The golden ratio), and the speed of light in vacuum, all were taken into consideration during construction. And all that was known by a bunch of slaves thousands of years ago that did nothing more than love there &quot;Dear leader&quot; oh so much? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what&#39;s weir is that, since the moon is moving away a little every day...
from wikipedia:
The Moon&#39;s current orbital distance, about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses. This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence. Earlier in Earth&#39;s history, the Moon was closer to Earth, and would have had an apparent visual size greater than that of the sun.

    <div class="md"><p>I used to believe we landed on the moon. Here&#39;s why I am now quite confident that we never actually landed on the moon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKainIQiaKA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKainIQiaKA</a>  (Copy of What Really Happened on the Moon -Documentary -Percy 2000)</p>

<p>It&#39;s a long but comprehensive documentary,</p>

<p>Here are a few highlights I found interesting:</p>

<p>Footage leaked from NASA in 2000 showing the 3 Apollo 11 astronauts in LEO faking a shot from 130k miles out from the earth and communicating to Houston that they are that far out, then removing a transparency from the command module window showing they are in fact still in LEO when they should have been 1 day out from lunar orbit. </p>

<p>Lunar backgrounds that reuse the same mountains in different shots of a mission. One with the lunar module present, then one with the lunar module not present. Also a lot of reuse of lunar foregrounds such as the exact same set of rocks in different shots. All this footage is from NASA. </p>

<p>An explanation of the Van Allen radiation belts around the earth that would kill any life that passed through them unshielded. Shielding of several feet of lead would be required for humans. This was the major technical hurdle that stopped Apollo from succeeding. </p>

<p>The Apollo astronauts launched to Low Earth Orbit and faked parts of the mission from there. Most of mission control in Houston did not know it was faked. Cape Canaveral launch center mostly did not know it was fake. Relatively few people knew about it. </p>

<p>The Apollo 1 astronauts were very outspoken about the feasibility of a moon mission. They were subsequently killed in an &#39;accident&#39; and made an example of. This succeeded in keeping people quiet. </p>

<p>NASA reports that all engineering data and paper work for the lunar module have been &quot;lost&quot;. There is no engineering data to review to see how the lunar module worked. </p>

<p>When looking at the dust of the lunar rovers, you see dirt flying up behind the wheels in turbulent flow making puffs of clouds. Clearly an atmosphere was present to cause this type of turbulent flow. </p>

<p>Shadows on the moon photos are not parallel indicating the the light source is not 93 million miles out, but a massive bank of lights near by.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also see footage of high wires supporting the astronauts to help simulate 1/6 Gs on the moon. Only 3 min. video: ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdMvQTNLaUE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdMvQTNLaUE</a> )</p>

<p>and all this is just a start to all the evidence. There is a lot lot more.</p>

<p>Do you really think if we hoaxed the moon landing the Soviets wouldn&#39;t have noticed that the radio transmissions weren&#39;t coming from the moon and told everyone?</p>

<p>Do you really think the Soviets wouldn&#39;t pour a massive amount of effort into analyzing everything about the Apollo program <em>specifically to determine if it was a hoax or front</em>?</p>

<p>So why didn&#39;t they expose it? It&#39;s not like they weren&#39;t capable of finding out; their espionage ability and tech level was more or less at parity with ours. Were they in on it too?</p>

<p>If so, what&#39;s the point in doing the stunt at all?</p>

<p>Needless to say, this is my pet peeve conspiracy.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html">landed</a> on the goddamn <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/369228main_ap14labeled_540.jpg">moon</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Soviets are that bad at analysis, why wouldn&#39;t I just launch my illegal space weapon under the banner of something mundane, like a communications or weather satellite.</p>

<p>Faking this in a way that wouldn&#39;t be discovered and disproven within a week isn&#39;t feasible without essentially doing the entire project. You need real spacecraft following the right trajectories at the right speed and sending out the right signals, because any reasonably sophisticated observer can check your story.</p>

<p>A flawless hoax on the scale of Apollo is gonna cost just about as much as <em>doing it for real</em>, so why not just do it?</p>

<p>as someone who works in lighting, i can tell you that if i wanted to emulate that lighting set up, i would do it in a place where there is intense sunlight, strong ground bounce to illuminate the astronaut&#39;s &#39;dark side&#39;, no atmosphere to diffuse the light, thus keeping the ground shadows pitch black.</p>

<p>The perfect place to fake the moon landing photos?  The moon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollow Earth theories are the ones that fuck me up the most. They completely unearth (pardon le pun) any prior understanding of the earth and its geology like no other. However, when you look at a lot of different facts, the theory of polar openings do seem logical. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights are supposedly artifacts of inner earth radiation;</p></li>
<li><p>there is the mysterious disappearance of the Greenland Vikings, who were said by the Inuit (Eskimo) Indians to have mass migrated to the North Pole in search of a bountiful paradise supposedly there, and which the Indians themselves already knew about but were afraid of the so called &#39;demons&#39; that supposedly inhabited this place; </p></li>
<li><p>the warped gravitational and magnetic field in the area that&#39;s supposed to be the North Pole, where planes have difficulty navigating because of instrument malfunctionings;</p></li>
<li><p>lack of satellites directly over the North Pole to provide imaging, resulting in a giant black hole on arctic weather maps, possibly due to lack of gravitational field to hold satellites in place there (apparently, the US had lost their first two satellites before they realized what happened);</p></li>
</ul>

<p>and so on. And strangely enough, the government&#39;s lack of information regarding these polar phenomena.</p>

<p>He takes centuries of observations to show that Venus, Mercury and Earth are indeed hollow (he only focuses on these planets, but makes it clear that the same should apply to all planets).</p>

<p>Tesla also believed that planets were naturally hollow.</p>

Something like that would take days/weeks of work and a ton of manpower. And I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that anything other than the 2 planes and the ensuing fire brought down the towers.</p>

<p>A more credible theory I&#39;ve heard is the government knew Al Qaeda was going to attack like that but decided not to do anything so that they&#39;d have an excuse to go to war. The only way we&#39;d be able to prove that though would be to have access to whatever intelligence the US had on them up to that point though, and I&#39;m sure almost all of that is classifeid.</p>

<p>edit: WTC 7 looked really suspicious, but until there&#39;s more concrete evidence on that I&#39;m on the fence about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly not. Hardened high carbon steel does not &quot;soften&quot; anyhwere near 1400c.... closer to 1850... Doesn&#39;t melt til about 2850c i believe... One needs thermite or a metal lance for this. Or a blast furnace. Engineers debunk the 911 story for a reason. As would most welders, i should think....
Adiabatic flame temperature of jet fuel. Google it. Melting point of high-tensile carbon steel? google it... Not rocket science....
Also: bending metal does not allow a building to fall straight into it&#39;s footprint at freefall speeds. WTC 7 is the most obvious one. If you can&#39;t see this you are guided more by &quot;authority&quot; than knowledge and logic. Enjoy that. It&#39;s easier, trust me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all true. What I find most interesting is how all the steel columns gave out at the exact same time. Even if one gave out 3 seconds after the others, the building would not have fallen straight down. Same holds true for the towers. How did all 3 buildings manage to fall straight down with their steel beams giving out equally? I&#39;ll check that link out when I&#39;m not mobile. Thanks! And why did BBC report wtc 7 collapsing before it did when the building was in plain site behind the anchor? That video is on YouTube (&quot;bbc wtc 7&quot; is the search term)  </p>

<p>There are all over this country so many different little clues, that the Holocaust happened and that Jews were murdered.</p>

<p>Just some blocks from my street, there are Memorials for Jewish families, which lived here 60 years ago, and were deported to the Concentration Camps.</p>

<p>That people still say, that the Holocaust did not happen, always trickles me. I mean, there is VIDEO FOOTAGE of the mass graves. Also so many Testimonies of survivors of these Death Camps. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t buy that some people say the Holocaust didn&#39;t happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure that the Holocaust happened but I do find it interesting that every decade or so the number of victims is always revised up.  So it started at 3 or 4 million and now we are at 6+ million.  I also think its interesting that the number of survivors that the German government pays has increased almost every year up to now.  If you consider that about half of the 2 million Vietnam vets are already dead, a war that ended in the 70s, how in the hell are we still finding new Holocaust survivors to pay?  People are lying.  </p>

<p>For your post though - your entire basis for your conclusion was an assumption. Why would gravity, or anything for that matter, have to be alien to them? People tend to forget the technology that an alien race would HAVE to have, given the circumstances of travel. The entire race would have to be in a higher state of consciousness, and all the things that come with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good point. I think most people (outside of this subreddit) would agree with you. Logically it is pretty simple to assume we are to small of a needle in this giant haystack for an alien civilization to find us. Still, I think the universes size lends itself to the earth being found because there are probably loads of planets that can sustain life. I think its pretty selfish of us to think we are alone(I know not your point). If humans have been searching for planets that can support life for several years and have had a few &quot;bites&quot;, I don&#39;t think its completely unbelievable that an older race of extraterrestrials found earth thousands of years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, in spite of calculations from mathematicians at the all levels at other sites and universities, this really isn&#39;t worth falling for (no pun intended). Building 7 in particular did indeed free fall for quite some distance. Noticeably watching videos of it collapse on itself, adding the countdown voiced by the law enforcement agencies and telling people to move away from it because &quot;They are bringing it down&quot; should be a clue. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s very accurate to say &quot;nearly free fall speeds&quot; because that has been proven even by this debunking site. There was little resistance and no signs of a pancake effect when done. To me this argument is an exercise is basically a waste of time because it&#39;s so close to free fall speeds it&#39;s not worth arguing over. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a mathematical difference between free fall speeds and free fall rate. Which means there was little or no resistance in the fall.</p>

<p>More importantly - eye witnesses heard and were victims of explosions under the buildings BEFORE the jets hit. </p>

<p>Most mathematicians, in fact all that I&#39;ve read take great exception to the official story and models they all say it &quot;flunks&quot; without exception. They also point out correctly that no EVEN IF it wasn&#39;t a perfect &quot;free fall&quot; the ENTIRE way in no way rules out controlled demolition for obvious reasons. </p>

<p>The collapse data was based on verified &amp; validated seismographic measurements which are/were correlated with the video and do not, in any way, refute or rebuke the plethora of evidence that speaks to the fallacy of the &quot;official story&quot; and are anecdotal at best -</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see an impartial to the investigation - but you and I both know that wont happen and why is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is really late for a comment, but I was looking for old threads like this.</p>

<p>The story about eyewitness claiming to hear explosions at the base of the towers is not very credible.  After all, they reported it after the fact.  In all the chaos that ensued, it&#39;s entirely possible that they only <em>thought</em> they heard explosions first.  Human memory is an unstable thing.  And in time of confusion, the brain can invent things that didn&#39;t happen in order to make sense of what is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole Jewish conspiracy. Of course Zionism sucks, and people say that Judaism itself is racist... but the idea that &quot;the Jews&quot; are at the heart of a worldwide super-conspiracy. Just not buying it. I get where they&#39;re coming from because I&#39;m not a big fan of organized religion in general, but I think that Catholicism might be a bigger threat to humanity (because there are more of them).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand that every power structure will have it&#39;s conspiracies. There&#39;s an Italian mafia, a Japanese mafia, obviously there is a Jewish mafia too. Obviously the Jewish mafia is going to be very strong since it&#39;s such an old culture/ power structure. So yeah there probably is a &quot;Jewish conspiracy&quot;, but to act like Jews are the cause of all humanity&#39;s problems is retarded and only generates hate. I guess I don&#39;t dismiss the idea of it completely, but the level poeple take it to seems silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK about the British celebrities (haven&#39;t looked it up). I&#39;ve worked in that industry and you wouldn&#39;t believe the lies that come out about famous people. The reason I can&#39;t go with the pagan sacrifices is I literally studied conspiracy theories night and day for a year once upon a time and eventually I got the end of the road where I was just like &quot;this makes no sense at all&quot; everything else made me go &quot;wow&quot; or &quot;i can see how that makes sense&quot; the pagan ritual &#39;proof&#39; was a really sketchy video where you couldn&#39;t see anything. On top of that they said the sacrifice was fake...not an actual person, just a representation. Supposedly this is being done by top officials- if they need a sacrifice I&#39;m sure they could get one, but not according to the sources I had found. As far a lizard people...its simple, why? WHy lizard people? why not show themselves? Why not enslave us more so if they are so powerful? Plus, every evidence piece of lizard people is just camera shots and people screeming &quot;these don&#39;t look like real people...show us your scales&quot; - if i was a police officer and someone asked me to show my scales i would facepalm and be fed up with them too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always surprised that the good folks of r/conspiracy tend to lump chemtrails in with reptilians and stuff. The chemtrail thing was my first conspiracy I encountered. This was before 9/11 so I was like 14. I remember reading the theory that they were doing it to alter the climate and offset &quot;global warming&quot;. I remember thinking that&#39;s one of the sillier explanations of why they would do this. I also remember reading about how people were doing tests on the air, water and soil and finding lots of aluminum oxide and stuff. Fast forward ten years... now there are scientists openly saying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw3eGPFrRkA">&quot;why yes we could spray aluminum trails from airplanes to offset global warming... of course we don&#39;t, but we <em>could</em>&quot;.</a> Everything I read about and believed ten years ago seems like it&#39;s being confirmed as more of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_sulfate_aerosols_%28geoengineering%29">geoengineering</a> stuff becomes public knowledge... except that they just haven&#39;t admitted they&#39;re actually doing it. Seriously, if you&#39;ve ever taken the time to watch what these planes do to sky on certain days (even if you consider it to be a regular byproduct of the engine), you&#39;d know without anybody telling you that the chemtrails (or contrails if you prefer) literally block out the sun and turn it into a &quot;cloudy&quot; (it&#39;s more of a haze) day. I can&#39;t find the exact same pdf on geoengineering I had read before (there&#39;s still plenty you can find) but they listed all the possible ways we could &quot;geoengineer&quot; the climate, and they made a point that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_sulfate_aerosols_%28geoengineering%29">Stratospheric sulfate aerosols</a> are the only method that would be affordable to do today. They said it&#39;s many times cheaper than any of the other options, and that the other options aren&#39;t really possible yet... but this one is... but they&#39;re still not doing it... but they&#39;ve done tests to prove that it&#39;s effective... but they&#39;re not <em>doing</em> it. I think this is one that people disregard because it&#39;s one of the hidden-in-plain-view conspiracies.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t understand why people believe the Government is a big benevolent mother that just loves to take care of you. Most governments feel the world is either over populated or very close to being and feel that it&#39;s necessary to do something about it. They can&#39;t come right out and just kill you - you&#39;d fight back, but if they soft kill you - you wont blame them it&#39;s always something or someone else fault. It&#39;s BP for spraying toxic chems in the water,etc... but the government allows it to take place. Don&#39;t judge them by what they say - judge them by what they are doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off I do not like the term conspiracy theory to describe what are mostly people&#39;s surmising or hypothesizing about events.  We all know that a theory in science is a hypothesis that has been tested and affirmed.  Therefore if some one says &quot;I think that all the world leaders are reptilians&quot; and they do not have any proof of it or anyway to back it up then it is only a hypothesis.  However, if they were to say &quot; I know all the government leaders are reptilians&quot; and then produce a reptilian body dressed in a suit that had a Donald Rumsfeld mask on, then you would have a valid theory.   So instead of conspiracy theories, they should really be conspiracy hypothesis.  </p>

<p>Also one that kinda bugs me is that we did not go to the moon.   I am pretty sure that if we didn&#39;t go there someone would have given a deathbed confession by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well after reading what you cant believe and why, i have to wonder....why? you state you believe influencing earth and we know our own species would pretend to be something or someone else to infiltrate and influence it(religion/race/governments/even animal herds). so what is different than an alien race pretending to be human to infiltrate and influence us. because why would a species with that technology allow themselves to be found out? well obviously there is accidental but think about how we find out about negative influence in other aspects of our own lives, someone/something with regret/remorse brings it to light right? if you&#39;re willing to say you believe an alien race could have influence over the earth then how can you say what this species actually looks like/came from. serious question not trying to put you down just wondering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legitimate question. I guess I&#39;m not saying that this couldn&#39;t happen. Reptoid aliens could totally be pulling the strings and I wouldn&#39;t know it. I guess where I get lost is when people say they know intimate details about this alien race that is controlling everything. If an alien race is the puppet master, I doubt we would know anything about them. If they came all the way to earth and controlled us for hundreds of years, they are probably pretty good at this shit. It seems David Icke and others have a lot of detailed information on a civilization that could pretty easily hide all this information without anyone ever knowing about it. I would think this civilization could vaporize David Icke, or others spreading information, without anyone at all even batting an eyelash. It almost seems too good to be true at times. Again this is just my personal opinion, I don&#39;t want to demean anyone who thinks this stuff is true. I think that is whats great about conspiracy theories. We all wade through these theories and take what we like and leave what we don&#39;t. Like you said, &quot;how can you say what this species actually looks like/came from&quot; I can&#39;t, and I don&#39;t think others can readily either and thats what I find hard about this theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just David Icke though. I&#39;m reading <em>The Gods of Eden</em> by William Bramley, who goes through a historical perspective of ancient cultures and comes to similar conclusions from what scant evidence there is of the past. For example, the symbol of the snake is found in every ancient culture across the globe, from Native Americans, Mayans, Chinese, Egyptian, and so on. Likewise, the story of a Great Flood is found in all those cultures&#39; ancient texts. The Sumerian texts describe the first modern homo sapiens as slaves for a race of higher beings. There is a lot of evidence for the background story of these theories, but yeah, to say Reptilians is still pretty funky. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11: Why? The most beloved conspiracy of our generation... Right? The one that for a lot of us, opened the &#39;flood gates&#39; as it were to critical thinking in the form of &quot;what if&#39;s?&quot;.</p>

<p>Easy.  Any intelligence agency knows that a good operation is only good as it&#39;s opsec.  Unfortunately loyalty, real loyalty which requires in some situations a sacrifice of honor, is hard to come by these days.  We are all so liberal in our sense of what guides a moral compass we will never agree as a nation on how to run &quot;black ops.&quot;</p>

<p>The point is that if 9/11 was a black op it was conducted by the most vetted and most likely the best.  The genius behind this black op is the lack of loose ends.  The most damning evidence in terms of real &#39;evidence&#39; not circumstantial history influenced assumptions, is the material that is supposedly space aged incendiary.  This means it was formed in low gravity conditions to give it ultimate bonding surface area potential as it no longer had to conform to the rings of gravity.  This is a very GRAND accusation and if true it relies in the ability of scientists to recreate the substance.  This is sadly the only &#39;hard&#39; evidence that I know of.</p>

<p>So if 9/11 was done in secret, it was done in true secrecy.  It was behind closed doors that our normal elected government will never come close to knowing, much less endorsing certain operations conducted in the name of influencing the agenda and policies of the USA.  It was thought through, there is still nothing damning to the point of &quot;i knew it&quot; in our evidence thus far.  It&#39;s weak.  The point is that it&#39;s time to stop wasting time on it, especially if it&#39;s an integral part of your viewpoint on life.  Yes, people are capable of remarkable yet unthinkable things.  This is ultimately our species advantage over every living thing on this earth.  Understand your role, and more importantly understand the roles of those around that you can observe yourself.  It is immensely more satisfying to study the prudish idea&#39;s of mankind born of a society with standards and ideas that you view incapable of adhering to.   This gives a unique and sometimes empathetic perspective as to which will only give you more introspective ideas in the long run.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ve gone on to long but I hope I am understood.</p>

<p>tl;dr: The truth is that if you understand the logistics and opsec behind an operation like 9/11 you must assume these men were very good at hiding their intentions amongst normal American&#39;s during their stay here in the US.  That said, it was simple exploitation of our good will towards foreigners, a once trademark in our ideas towards immigrants and other societal influences, that let them slip through the cracks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s somethings to think about. Hitler did the same thing with the Reichstag fire in order to gain power or consolidate power from the people by using is own version of the &quot;patriot act&quot;. The scenario is almost identical.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the coincidence of the McCormack-Dickstein Committee Hearings (1934-1935) which was formed because there were very wealthy and well known Americans that were planning to over throw the United States government and implement communism. Some of these people are VERY well known, the Dupont family, Prescott Bush (GW Bush senior&#39;s daddy), Remington family, J.P. Morgan (citibank). </p>

<p>No body wanted to believe this either but they had the best eye witness there was - general Smedley Butler - who would you believe?</p>

<p>No one ever was punished for this ultimate treason. Considering this and the fact that the bushes were in power at the time of 9/11 it&#39;s not at all hard to believe that some if not MANY people know and are very afraid or think it was best for the country or world. Marvin Bush was head of security WTC at the time of the attacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/ISOs_GXEL40?t=10s">http://youtu.be/ISOs_GXEL40?t=10s</a> This is just a short clip that you should watch if you haven&#39;t already showing the Bush history - it will include McCormack-Dickstein hearings. </p>

<p>Look up September Clues. Any edition will do. It&#39;s honestly incredible. Even I can add something to it - once you&#39;re done watching it, think about how the technology for overlaying LIVE was in its infancy then, but contrast that with what happens on every football game live - how they broadcast the yellow lines and stuff under the players but above the field. There is a LOT they can do with live footage...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.  9/11 by nature was a conspiracy in that several people knew certain things and were feeding information to other people who knew certain things.  Susan Lindauer&#39;s story confirms this but the bottom line was that the operation was kept secure for the most part due to what is known as operational security.  9/11 was a conspiracy, conducted by a group of people, some say it could have included possible Mossad agents when they were caught filming it on the bridge... Does this mean that the conspiracy went all the way to the top?  Most likely not.  That and there in is where the beauty behind this operation lies.  There is just no accountability and no real way of knowing these guys sources and methods.  How they were recruited/vetted/trusted to complete a plan of this obvious globe-changing magnitude is still an unknown.  People want the obvious answer.  The obvious answer is that a good recon of your enemy and knowing where they are vulnerable and striking them where it will hurt most is not some nefarious evil-inspired jihadist movement, it&#39;s utilizing tactics of war effectively.

    <div class="md"><p>A building of that magnitude wouldn&#39;t fall straight down. And to have it happen twice is unheard of. The odds are astronomical. Wtc 7? No planes. Very few fires. It falls straight down. Steel doesn&#39;t melt at those temps unless thermite is used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but I don&#39;t necessarily believe that conspiracies need to have money and/or power as their goal. They can be caused by anything... a true desire to play god and be the master of the universe... or just a need to keep a shitty system propped up because they depend on it... they can be due to religious fanaticism... for revenge.
