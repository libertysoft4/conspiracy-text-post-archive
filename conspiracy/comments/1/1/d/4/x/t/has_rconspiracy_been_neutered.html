And when real stories of interest get posted and start getting upvotes, they get disappeared and have to be resubmitted. And more recently, I&#39;m seeing the trend of a self post asking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> what they think about a particular aspect of &quot;the conspiracy realm&quot;, effectively datamining consensus and sniffing out who&#39;s who. </p>

<p>Who&#39;s minding the store, and how much are they taking out of the till? Will the real <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> participants please stand up?!</p>

How can you expect people to give you the time to take your lengthy thoughts seriously, when you can&#39;t take the time to decide where and when to hit the &quot;enter&quot; key a few times, for easier reading? Sloppy. And IMO 70-95% of those posts aren&#39;t worth reading.

    <div class="md"><p>There is actually a purpose to paragraphs.  They separate blocks about concepts. When someone just does stream of consciousness, run-on spewing, instead of organized thinking, it&#39;s usually a sign they&#39;re merely opinionating.  That&#39;s my objection here.  And that it reads like a speech to a high school graduating class.</p>

<p>I add plenty worthwhile, I have lots of interesting discussion with people.</p>

<p>It seems I REALLY struck a nerve with people by reminding them that the downvote isn&#39;t your opinion button, unless you&#39;re too stupid to understand that, in which case it immediately becomes that.</p>

<p>How do you figure? You seem to be the only one agitated by anything given the context.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or you can just all keep proving how butthurt you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rest of your post was just complaining. You gave your opinion (which, we&#39;ve already gone back and forth about) and you insulted people.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t down vote your post, I don&#39;t down vote or up vote anything that has no substance. In case you haven&#39;t noticed, people just aren&#39;t agreeing with you. Shocking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Downvoting someone&#39;s perspective is idiotic, but people don&#39;t want to hear that, because it&#39;s easier to have an opinion button to silence people who you disagree with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally find it easier to find someone&#39;s post if it&#39;s an average post if it has been down voted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He contributed to the conversation, they did not. I pointed it out, everyone got butthurt. That&#39;s the synopsis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He contributed a post that by hitting enter four times it would have been much easier to read. Could someone have been more polite in saying it? Probably. But I can see the upside to encouraging someone to actually format their post so people won&#39;t just skim by it.</p>

<p>If I see a post like that filled with run-on sentences and opinions that I <em>know</em> I&#39;ve already read from another perspective, I generally will just breeze through it.</p>

<p>In a community 100% based around word formatting and discussion with words, wouldn&#39;t suggesting that other people at least make an effort to make their thoughts attractive to read through, be a good thing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never called you specifically butthurt, but of course you knew that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Said what now? You said &quot;can just all keep proving how but hurt you are..&quot; in a reply to me. That is calling me butt hurt?</p>

<p>No more of this idiotic reptile bullshit, no more taking literally any post on the front page that has any mediocre resemblance to military and screaming that it&#39;s military propaganda, no more calling OMFGF@ FALSE FLAG at literally... every...single...fucking...international event to ever fucking take place...</p>

<p>While we are at it, no more upvoting people who put forth their own little personal &quot;Theory&quot; with absolutely zero proof or even thought process.</p>

<p>No more screaming SHILL SHILL at every single person who comes in and asks for some proof. </p>

<p>Instead, the new place should be called something like Conspiracy SCIENCE. 
People value fact, observation, evidence, logic. You have none of these things? Good bye, we don&#39;t want your stupid fucking Conspiracy Theories. We want your Conspiracy Hypothesis, we want you to QUESTION our theories, so that we can solidify them into an even better and more evidenced solution, or throw them in the fucking trash.</p>

<p>That&#39;s half the problem around here anymore, people get their little theory in their head, and they never want it to be proven wrong. That&#39;s not how intelligent debate works, and that certainly isn&#39;t how a true and honest search for the truth works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing wrong with discussing people&#39;s personal theories, but much of what you say is spot on. It&#39;s almost impossible to have a real discussion about any topic, be it reptilians, ufos, illuminati, or banking/now cabals. And that&#39;s just the fringe stuff. It seems even more difficult to converse about factual world events in here and that&#39;s troubling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a mod and a subscriber to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> since its inception, I don&#39;t really agree with all these comments about the downfall of this /r/ - in fact, I am of the opinion that this /r/ has been vindicated - as the shit we as conspiracy theorists have talked about for decades is finally being recognized. This world is owned, the perception of this reality is closely controlled and there is a very small % of humans who control the fate of the rest.</p>

<p>We have seen a signficant uptick in users in this /r/ and we have also seen a great awakening to the reality of this world.</p>

<p>As a mod, anything is wlcome in this /r/ other than blatant hate on [any topic] as it reveals ignorance. </p>

<p>Ignorance is the cancer of this /r/ and the minds that want the truth.</p>

<p>Should we discuss reptilians? Human origins? Paranormal? Energy? Spirit? God?</p>

<p>Yes we should - but at the same time we have some pretty fucking pressing matters at hand: the subtle oppression and control that humans suffer from at the hand of other humans.</p>

<p>Humans actively conspiring to exploit and control our reality.</p>

<p>Humans working to limit the free flow of true knowledge. Knowledge of our true nature, true power, true divinity.</p>

<p>Fuck every religion on the planet - they are all a ruse to blind you from yourself. You are a component of this universe - a sentient and conscious component. You are the universe, appearing separate, in order to learn and observe yourself.</p>

<p>Everything that is, lies within, you are perfect in every way.</p>

<p>Want to discuss this or anything else? <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is open, as am I.</p>

The only thing I disagree with is a matter of perspective I suppose and I can only speak for myself as a person who has been here for a little over a year with regards to what I see as a reduction in acceptance of opposing viewpoints and rampant misuse of up/down votes to stymy genuine dialogue.

<p>With that said; we (as a community) should also self-moderate out idiots, shills, bad content, etc.</p>

<p>The mods on here are not some hivemind at all. I personally do not censor any information, and be warned: every single thing that happens on every subreddit is monitored closely by The Man. They have been very active in their efforts to develop behavioral shaping systems for online forums (HBGary, most famously - and the military propaganda that has been happening over the past year) - we have greater imminent threats to our freedom of thought right now that some of the more theoretical topics that would be typical to this type of forum.</p>

<p>Finally, I think we need sub-sub-reddits so that we can categorize the content of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> better.</p>

<p>See, here&#39;s the thing. </p>

<p>This sub has went pretty mainstream of late. You almost have 100,000 subscribers. A lot of these subs are people who found the sub after x-posts to Skeptic, Conspiratard etc. </p>

<p>What you call shills are actually people who don&#39;t buy into conspiracy theories, and will debate them with you. As I said the other day, if you claim to know the &quot;truth&quot;, prepare to defend it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number of subscribers to r/conspiracy has nearly tripled since I became a redditor. While that fact may be the biggest reason I recognize so few monikers these days, I suspect many regular submitters have grown tired of the politics and soap opera-esque drama that occurs between fellow redditors and moderators. </p>

<p>As regular contributors have jumped ship, the quality of the content in r/conspiracy has gone downhill. </p>

<p>While images are capable of conveying a strong message, there is no depth of information. Images are the Burger King of knowledge.</p>

<p>OP, I&#39;m in total agreement with you in regard to the self-posts asking why r/conspiracy redditors think the way they do. If these self-submitting redditors were truly interested in conspiracies they wouldn&#39;t have to ask the types of questions they ask.</p>

<p>Last of all, I miss ImJulianAssange. I don&#39;t know what kind of drama transpired between the mods and ImJulianAssange and I don&#39;t care. What I do know is r/conspiracy has the depth of a mud puddle since he&#39;s left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit isn&#39;t the best place to expect people to understand the difference between theories and accepted reality. Like 9/11 for example. We really just want a better investigation, because really we are theorizing the possibility of alternate conspiracy. What happened on 9/11 was a conspiracy by definition but the perpetrators are what we question. They key here is questioning. It&#39;s like the difference between an atheist and agnostic, and givens reddits obsession with atheism do you really expect them to think things might be different then what they think? Most people on reddit are pretentious about their knowledge and believe what they know to be reality so they would more then likely be cynical about anything outside of their knowledge base. It&#39;s only a matter of time. Lies can only be hidden for so long before reality bites.</p>

<p>This community needs to just down vote crap, and move on. Don&#39;t start a discussion about it, don&#39;t make a thing out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills faggots should all be ashamed of their jobs. I hope they will realize it when they will look at themselves in the mirror.</p>

<ul>
<li>9/11 is an obvious inside job.</li>
<li>Iran&#39;s nuclear threat is fucking fake.</li>
<li>Mitt Romney will get elected no matter what just to keep things as they are.</li>
<li>USA is not a democracy.</li>
<li>There is no army called &quot;Al-Qaida&quot; or some bullshit like this.</li>
<li>Dugway proving ground (I JUST WENT TOO FAR!!)</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, I am almost thinking about:</p>

<ul>
<li>r/conspiracy mods are all shillsfag.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all humility i may not be right, but I dare you to prove me wrong.</p>

<p>Other than mass-media propaganda, what has made you oppose these?</p>

<p>You <em>do</em> know that the USA is a republic, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any one can anonymously click an arrow on a page. It takes next to no effort (or thought). There is absolutely no accountability for their action.</p>

<p>Not only that, but if the karma is already in the negative that person will feel compelled to click the down arrow (without even reading the content). We want to go with the flow. We want to fit in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an inherently  broken system that can <em>never</em> produce optimal results.</p>

<p>Someone suggested a long time ago that reddit keep the arrows and get rid of the karma. But nooooooooooo. Fuck that. I gotsta have my points baby! Touchdown! Home Run! Goooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal!</p>

<p>The system cannot work because its driven by selfish, petty, ignorant humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am one of your so called &quot;shills&quot;. I don&#39;t just do it for the money, I do it because we are right. The ends justify the means. We will win in the end. Information is power, and we have devised methods of information control that are leaps ahead of what you imagine. We control this subreddit, we allow a certain proportion of posts to rise so as not to make things too obvious.</p>

<p>We target certain users with what we have dubbed &quot;stress overload&quot;. This is an effective method of removing users, as they feel they are leaving of their own accord. We have done quite the job on 9000sins ;)</p>

<p>Enjoy your petty subreddit, you mean nothing. You have no influence.</p>

<p>... only joking!</p>
