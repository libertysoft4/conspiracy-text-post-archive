    <div class="md"><p>I often wonder about Masonry. On the one hand you have all these powerful people throughout time that have been Masons. Yet on the other hand there isn&#39;t much to go on as far as conspiracies, as far as I know. My father in law has been a mason his whole life and he said he&#39;s never heard of any conspiracies. His brother is/was Grand Master Mason (I think) at one of America&#39;s oldest lodges in the nation. Acacia lodge 18 in New Jersey if I recall. My father in law told me he asked his brother one day if he had ever heard of any conspiracy worthy happenings and he laughed and said he never heard or saw anything. It&#39;s possible he said, but he was never brought in on anything.</p>

<p>These days I think Masonry is pretty harmless. A throw back to a time when you needed someone to trust and being a mason meant you could be trusted. It also provided context to the universe at a time when science was still devolving. The &quot;creator&quot; of the universe is refereed to as the &quot;grand architect&quot;, using tools as metaphors i.e., a compass provided direction, a ruler provided a straight path, a chisel to shape and mold character.</p>

<p>If there is a conspiracy then they are doing a great job of covering it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two theories about Freemasonry. One is that it developed, literally, from the masons guild of the middle ages and that in its secret meetings it promoted democracy and freedom, subversive ideas in the days when Europe was ruled by kings and popes. And that is why Washington and most of the founding fathers were masons. </p>

<p>The catholic church&#39;s hatred of masonry supports this idea. Only Freemasonry&#39;s opposition to the rule of the popes would arouse such hatred. </p>

<p>The other idea is that European Freemasonry was invaded and subverted by the Illuminati, a group of European wealthy. George Washington, a mason, warned against them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first President of the United States, George Washington, believed that the Illuminati intended to separate the people from their government in his letters in the Library of Congress. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly most of the lower levels of masonry are unaware of any nefarious plots. What exists at higher levels, they don&#39;t know. Have the upper levels been subverted? </p>

<p>But let me tell you about the black masons, which a black co-employee told me about. He had been invited to join the black masons and said that that was the only way a black man could get promoted to supervisor in our workplace. And that once they were promoted they were obligated to protect and promote other black masons. He also said that there was a testing period during which the candidate would have to prove his loyalty to the group. For instance, if a brother mason called him up in the middle of the night and told him to bring a change of clean clothes and a shovel to the middle of nowhere, he was supposed to do it, secretly, in an almost help bury the body type scenario. He said he had talked to his preacher about it and had been told he couldn&#39;t join. So he had given up the idea of ever being a supervisor. </p>

<p>I wonder if the white masons are like that. That they promote and protect each other. Like fraternity brothers do. (No wonder there&#39;s a glass ceiling.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It comes from what is known as &quot;mystery religions&quot; which were fertility cults that initiated people into the truths of the religions.  Also a lot of the symbols used in freemasonry have to do with sexual organs, astrology, numerology, geometry, magic - basically a lot of esoteric stuff that is regarded as extremely flakey by most people.  This presents a problem when you are talking about freemasonry because it can sound like you are endorsing these things, which makes you sound like a kook, but you are really just describing Freemasonry.  The million dollar question is why do the most powerful people in the world believe in this stuff?  Its interesting that they (the initiated) claim to have secret knowledge, which the ignorant masses (the profane) are ignorant of.  By the way, as others have pointed out there are tiers to masonry - so many of the people involved in it really are just businessmen, who as far as I can tell think the aforementioned stuff is as flakey as everyone else.</p>
