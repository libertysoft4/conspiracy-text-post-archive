        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t mean this end of the world garbage, I mean rumors of war, the economy getting worse, reports of increased suicides in Greece &amp; Spain, wars escalating and maybe climate change. I just have this feeling/sense that something bad or some horrible event is going to happen in the next 5 years.I read all about the Mayans 21 dec 2012 conspiracy, i don&#39;t believe it  is the end of the world but more of a end of an era. The age of peace and prosperity (for people living in the western world atleast) is over and we are about to start paying for the sins of the industrial revolution. We need to decide where we&#39;re going as a race, what our ultimate objectives are etc etc. We have all this wonderful technology and potential but are still locked into a very &#39;industrial revolution&#39; mindset, mybe we see the beginnings of tecnology outpacing the NWO doctrine with the rise of fileshering (information is power) and the invention of 3D printers. I feel we are about to come to some sort of intagable crossroad where something needs to change but I&#39;m not sure what, because what we have simply does not work, and efforts by the NWO to maintain our current socio-economic model are quite dangerous, because it&#39;s that very model that&#39;s put us where we are right now, what blows me away is that the industrial revolution was only about 200 years ago, that is litrally nothing in the span of human evolution. Sorry for the long rant but i was wondering if anyone else felt the same way and if anyone had any solutions as to what is going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen many references to continued economic fallout following the upcoming election. Things are so bad in Europe at the moment that car dealers are buying their own new cars themselves and reselling them as used in an effort to shore up their sales numbers. I&#39;ve seen reports of Warren Buffet sized individual investors pulling out of supposedly secure government bonds to hard investments such as silver or gold. At this time the US Supreme Court is taking a case which suggests that individuals do not have the right to resell personal property purchased due to copyright infringement. Basic tenants of social order are already failing. The backlash cannot be far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WW 2 doesn&#39;t count as global social breakdown? I realize there&#39;s more at play in that, but the political forces at play at that time are easily equaled in today&#39;s world. Just today Hungary&#39;s leader has publicly commented that he doesn&#39;t believe that the democratic institutions in the EU can withstand the economic stress they are currently facing. Prior to WW 2 we didn&#39;t have the abrogations of liberty in America we face today, including &quot;The Patriot Act&quot; and the suspension of habaes corpus Obama refuses to lift; legislation which must have the founding fathers spinning in their graves, compounded by our meek acceptance if it. The tax inequities which the Boston Tea Party protested were a pittance compared to what we face today, and Tweesle-Dee &amp; Tweedle-Dum Romney &amp; Ryan want to widen the gulf. They make the Romans look like pikers. International stresses continue to build with the declaration by North Korea that their nukes can strike the U.S., tensions between Japan and China growing, continued turmoil in the Middle East, the GOP silently accepting Romney&#39;s call for U.S. intervention in Syria, and so much more. The pot is at a boiling point like never before with no signs of sanity and calm on the horizon. This litany could be stretched out for pages, without even mentioning the fallout natural disaster could bring, and the multiple tipping-points ecologically any rational person can see we seem to be balanced or nearly so at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF the TPTB are up to something, it&#39;s gonna be bigger more traumatic than what happened on 9/11. If it is a false flag event they have make sure that the general public are on side to enter a new war/conflict. 12 year anniversary for the war in Astan today and that&#39;s arguably the 21st centuries Vietnam, useless expenditure of resources for little or no gain. Because, if you watch the news in North America, we are less safe than we have ever been. That&#39;s bollocks, always has been. </p>

<p>The interwebs is our saving grace. One of the only places you can learn and educate yourself in a realistic way without bias, IF you look hard enough. They can&#39;t have peons like us learning how deceitful and corrupted they truly are and that is happening, especially in this Reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>Fear-mongering really. This has been the way of the world for a very very long time. People have been plotting and scheming their little plans for quite some time now, this is nothing new. The only difference is the refinement of their plans and the fact we can access a tremendous amount of information globally in the blink of an eye and thus coverage of events/news is immense.</p>

<p>Every little bit of information gets analyzed, dumbed down and edited to fit someones view of the world and then published for consumption. This is again nothing new. So yes, something bad will happen Soon™. But then again, something bad happens Soon™ every single day. To speculate about some would-be global disaster will do you or us <em>no good</em>. Unless you directly are responsible for how the armed forces in your country would respond to something you really don&#39;t have anything to worry about.</p>

<p>And I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about the state of human evolution. TPTB, in whatever incarnation they appear in have very little say in where the human race is going. The best they can do is hold us back with their little monetary systems and technological gadgets and shiny things and ideologies based on pride and arrogance but <em>they cannot stop human evolution</em>. Only slow it down.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose they could throw a tantrum and try to burn the earth to a cinder but that&#39;s a bit pointless and defeatist IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I always thought the &#39;elite&#39; were on a timeline because they can only suppress technology so much. At a certain point it will be advanced enough that their usual mechanisms of control i.e. fuel, pharmaceuticals, food production will become redundant because high enough technology will be in the public&#39;s hands that they won&#39;t need to use their systems to exist and flourish.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re almost at that crossroad as you say so they will have to be daring if they want to introduce their own system. They may not have enough time for a gradual transition so they&#39;ll have to kick off a giant war or bring down the financial system which will lead to their all-controlling orwellian society. </p>
