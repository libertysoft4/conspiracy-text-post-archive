Think of it as a distribution curve:  Is it skewed toward relatively mundane theories, such as the fed making sure money stays in the banks, as I think someone else in this thread commented, or is it skewed toward the radical, such as shape-shifting &quot;reptilians&quot; that walk among us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm...it may depend on what you mean by &quot;conspiracy&quot;. My examples would be: The Gulf of Tonkin was concocted to get us into Vietnam. The MKUltra experiments happened. Whistleblower Thomas Drake has some great details on the NSA. Those are real events and things that, at the time of their occurence, were covered up. The Drake case might be one of the best, most recent examples, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you want to see which one of you&#39;re two preconcieved notions of what every single one of us believe in is the more accurate. Because we all believe the exact same stuff, right? You want to know which one of you&#39;re two biases is the right one? You ever wonder if some of us don&#39;t believe either of the two things you list. Do you realize how you twist different people&#39;s ideas together and put words into people&#39;s mouth. That stupid post on the front page... yes it was stupid... but it didn&#39;t imply that they were withholding a cure. It implied that they had no economic motivation to look for one. There is a prefectly good argument against this... so why do you have to twist what was said in order to make it seem extra crazy so you don&#39;t even have to argue with it. It&#39;s because you&#39;re fucking lazy, and you&#39;re fucking stupid. I don&#39;t see why people waste effort trying to convince you people of anything. Eat GMO, drink flouride, and don&#39;t prepare for an economic collapse, please. </p>

<p>You guys make yourselves look like the &quot;label them crazy&quot; sort of people with this stupid shit.</p>

<p>Here you had someone, who admittedly doesn&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories, yet he is intrigued that there is such a large population who do, and he comes to try to understand what all the hubbub is. Then what happens? You act like little children who don&#39;t understand anything about logic.</p>

<p>Guess what guys... the burden of proof, is always on the person making the positive claim. We are the ones who make positive claims about these theories, the burden of proof is on us.

    <div class="md"><p>MK Ultra testing went on for a very long period, the FBI targeted minority leaders and infiltrated the black panthers, and was responsible for arming them. The government was also responsible for bringing crack to the poverty stricken areas of the country, in an effort to snuff out the revolution seeking minorities. The crack cocaine was tracked back to the Contras, which were backed by Reagan&#39;s administration. The FBI also was running covert operations on Martin Luther King, trying to assassinate his character, threatening and blackmailing him over the phone, and trying to convince him to commit suicide. Once again, you can find information on these operations quite easily  </p>

<p>This is the most obvious one to me, but of course there&#39;s a multinational shadow government that has been planning the course of humanity. How else could you possibly explain the number of foreign governments we have sent the CIA in to infiltrate, funded the opposition of, and then bent to the will of the private entities they had revolted against? It&#39;s absurd the way the United States government has acted solely on the behalf of corporations who couldn&#39;t have their laborers revolting for increased rights in the past, and yet people pretend that the war we&#39;ve found ourselves in is for anything but genocide and the dollar that comes with it. More than one U.S. official has claimed that the number one foreign policy should be depopulation.  </p>

<p>Everything that is happening is to the will of a few. Why do so many of our ranking officials have these secret clubs that we aren&#39;t allowed to know anything about? They don&#39;t sit around and twiddle their thumbs while giggling at how everyone thinks they&#39;re actually doing something. Not a single high ranking official will comment on their time spent at Bilderberg beyond petty small talk, and if you mention the Bohemian Grove, they run straight for the hills. </p>

<p>The federal reserve is privately owned, but you already knew that. I have to leave now, but I&#39;ll leave you with a humorous video that was on the front page of this subreddit a couple of days ago maybe, since you obviously don&#39;t visit here. </p>

<p>Consipracy in the context of this subreddit, from what I&#39;ve seen, means people in power conspiring to control others&#39; lives or the outcomes of world events.</p>

<p>Conspiracy in the context of the google search you linked means a simple plan to commit a crime.</p>

<p>Your bias is what prevents you from learning, which is why you think all conspiracies are bunk. Why you&#39;re here is anyone&#39;s guess, but hardly anyone is dense enough to believe it&#39;s of educational or benign intent. </p>

<p>Which is my entire point about your stance. Your request in the OP is demonstrably and deceptively subjective. Which would logically lead to a person questioning your actual motives, here. Along with your proud and seemingly necessary announcement that you &#39;laugh at conspiracies&#39;. . </p>

<p>Read that document.  Basically they are saying Democracy doesn&#39;t work, and what is needed is a strong central non-democratic Government.  And what is the message of that flag in the crosshairs?  Isn&#39;t it that nation states should or are going to be abolished?  Just keep this document in your mind next time you are laughing at how crazy someone is that believes that elites really are trying to build a totalitarian one world government.</p>
