<p>The rockets going into space were all real, but the landings were hoaxes. They probably just went to the moon, did some measurements from space and returned back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the stupidest commonly-held conspiracy out there, and an insult to the single greatest human achievement ever. Almost half a million people were involved with the Apollo program, and nobody from within the program had come forward: it would literally be more difficult to keep a lid on that than to just land a couple people on the moon. Every independent scientist that has studied the moon rocks holds no doubt that they came from the moon, and NOBODY from the credible scientific community claims the moon landings were a hoax. But I think the best point is that there was no suggestion of this from the Soviets. You can be damn sure they were monitoring the moon missions with everything they could, praying for failure, and have never made any claim that the Americans did anything but land on the moon. Stop perpetuating idiocy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appealing to the half a million involved is not what I find to be a compelling argument.</p>

<p>Compartmentalization is necessary in a project this big, there is no way that all of those half a million people understood the full scope of the project.  Each only had to do their job as requested:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculating requirements</li>
<li>Designing parts</li>
<li>Building parts to spec</li>
<li>Assembling parts</li>
<li>Flying to the moon</li>
</ul>

<p>Each job is a little gear in the machine.  It is unlikely that any of the astronauts could field strip and reassemble the lunar module.</p>

<p>As for everyone at mission control?  It could have been another training simulation they were hoodwinked on.  It is like Ender&#39;s game; but in reverse.  Beyond the voice communication, no other information received hadn&#39;t been faked in training many times before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you&#39;re totally missing my point, which is that nobody from within the program has ever claimed it was a hoax, not one. The only people who think it was a hoax have zero connection to the program, as well as zero evidence for their belief. And you mentioned another point for me, all those people involved actually did stuff. I know the lunar landers legs were built in Canada; people from all over actually built this machine. And I know a lot of people who belief this garbage will say well the astronauts just went to orbit, and came back a few days later. I can&#39;t say that this would be your argument, but if it is, you&#39;re already admitting they could survive that long in space, how difficult is it to believe they were given one extra nudge to put them in a Lunar Capture  Orbit? They then fall onto a body that has 1/6 earth gravity, and zero atmosphere, and use a small rocket a few days later to escape that minute gravity. You over-complicate this thing. Yes rocket science is incredibly complex, but the basic ideas aren&#39;t. Fuel burns, rocket goes to space. Fuel burns some more, sends tin-can, albeit complex tin-can, to moon. Tin-can falls to moon, tin-can burns fuel and leaves moon, falls to earth. Now you want to go through the steps of faking that and covering it up? That is a significantly more complex answer, with steps still taking place today, to the question of if they went to the moon. Occam&#39;s Razor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet, if they claimed it was a hoax, you&#39;d be all over that. It&#39;s like arguing with religious people, facts and evidence cannot be used to sway your opinion. Yes, it is not direct evidence that they went, it is evidence that the only other nation near capable of landing on the moon, and one with a strong propaganda machine and a vested interest in the Americans failing, has never claimed it was a hoax. If you would like hard evidence, I would again point to the moon rocks that have been independently verified throughout the scientific community as genuine. I would point you to the laser reflectors the Apollo landings left, that are still used today all over the world to measure the exact distance to the moon. I will ask you to google image search LRO Apollo landing sights, where the current lunar orbiter has taken pictures of the landing sights. The moon doesn&#39;t stay over the United States all the time, receiving stations in Australia had to be used to get the signal back from the moon, and they had to be pointed at the moon to get the signal. If you look closely enough at the films, you can see the moon dust falling in parabolic arcs as it is kicked up; only possible in a vacuum. Now I know people will claim that the Russians are in on it, or that those silly scientists couldn&#39;t know what a genuine moon rock actually was, or whatever logical fallacies they can to be able to keep clinging to this belief. That is why I compare it to religion; I have presented you with the facts and the evidence, but your belief is ingrained. You ignore the evidence and rely on poorly produced videos on youtube that show (gasp!) there are no stars in the films and pictures from the moon, even though anybody with basic camera knowledge could tell you a camera isn&#39;t going to pick up the bright lunar surface and the stars at the same time, let alone what kind of idiots could fake the moon landing, but forget the stars? You&#39;re entitled to your opinion, but that doesn&#39;t make it a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the point of this post. Those claims you make on the moon landing being fake is something that FemaCampDirector does not believe. Correcting him/her is a feeble attempt, as I&#39;m sure he/she has heard it all before. But, within their reasoning, they don&#39;t find it sound. </p>

<p>Someone else could say the same with your thoughts on aliens visiting and reptilians existing, and provide you with their &quot;proof&quot; that you&#39;ve heard hundreds of times before. And yet, you cease to believe it due to the reasons in your mind, whatever they may be.</p>

<p>The point being is that everyone has their own opinions on different subjects, and that was the point of WitchScroLL&#39;s post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>kind of weird i suscribe to this subreddit because with what im about to say. I do not think there is a shadow government, I do not think there is a secret cabal intent on power to control the whole world and to keep down the underclass because they hate them or something. I think its a bunch of really rich guys that have similiar goals , not in concert with each other but they end up taking the same course anyways. I think its just human greed/nature that causes them to act in short sighted ways. Max profit in the shortest amount of time. They can make decisions that end up killing people because they do not see the death up close. There arent reptile aliens, satanic cults and shit ( well for the most part) just a bunch of rich mostly white dudes trying to keep power for themselves. I can see ( not agree) how they think of the underclasses as beneath them. Have you ever had someone who makes less money than you (even a kid) make a unreasonable demand or act in a way you might think is ungrateful? You ( well at least I would) be quick to anger and condescension. I try not to be an asshole but I will be lying if I said being rich wont make me hesitant to make decisions that might be in most peoples interests but hurt my own. That said fuck these elite assholes.</p>

<p>I think this are 60-70%  of the people and this the reason its easy for the 30-40% that are really into the Agenda to control them and us (normal people).

    <div class="md"><p>Water fluoridation.  I&#39;m a water and wastewater technician and I can tell you as a fact that in many areas fluoridation does not happen, especially now due to the economy.  It&#39;s an extra expense.  Where I work we add no fluoride.  We get water from two wells straight from groundwater at my plant.  All we do is treat with sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant.</p>

As MASSIVE as our solar system is, what in the fuck are the odds of this absurd event happening? YouTube doesn&#39;t help matters.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;we&quot; didn&#39;t see fire that brought down the buildings. You may have. There is no way in my opinion that  a fire, 80-100 floors up heated enough steel in an hour to cause a full collapse. The lower floors would have maintained enough integrity to shift the demolished floors to one side of the building as they fell. Not &quot;pancake&quot; straight down with little or no resistance.</p>
