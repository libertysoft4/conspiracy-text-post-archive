        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The supposed lawsuit &quot;abeel v. bank of america&quot; doesn&#39;t exist on any government website.  The case is supposedly about to be heard by the Supreme Court of New York.  There would have to be several appeals before the supreme court of New York even heard this case.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t find any record in the media or on a .gov website of The supposed lawsuit &quot;abeel v. bank of america&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to think that there isn&#39;t a $43 trillion hearing at all.  Anybody with a lawyer can file a suit, but as soon as a hearing is scheduled, you can look that shit up on a .gov website.  Even if they did file a lawsuit, it wouldn&#39;t be heard by the NY Supreme Court out of nowhere.</p>

<p>Give me a break... Somebody&#39;s trolling.  Look at the language they used in the article.  A lawsuit against the &quot;banksters&quot;?</p>

<p>Sounds like anonymous hacked somebody&#39;s account and posted a manifesto.  The original article wasn&#39;t even CNBC.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a shill.  I&#39;m not a troll.  I&#39;m skeptical.  Show me a .gov record of this lawsuit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, seems like someone was able to slip that article in somehow, and a few lazy news sites just copied the story verbatim from the wire without looking at it, giving conspiracy theorists everywhere a hard-on.</p>

<p>Then they realized their mistake, took the article down, inciting the conspiracy even further. Seriously, the immature use of &quot;bankster&quot; everywhere throughout the article alone means that no respectable news organization would knowingly run it, no sinister government censorship necessary.</p>

<p>Comtex seems to be a news aggregator, pulling in articles from a multitude of sources and providing them to downstream subscribers  like CNBC in a standardized format. With the amount of sources and stories that go through them, I&#39;m not surprised that they don&#39;t check them.</p>

<p>They got the story from PR Newswire, which you can hire to publish your company&#39;s press releases and the like. They probably just publish whatever you pay them for.</p>

<p>Edit: Both spire-law.com and spirelawgroupllp.com are registered through Domains By Proxy, LLC. Not proof of anything, but certainly strange for a respectable firm. Their website does not list any office address, only an email address, a phone number and a contact form.</p>

<p>It <em>does</em> however list their bar number as &quot;California State Bar Registration Number 54393&quot;. The State Bar of California website says it belongs to &quot;Marjorie Ellen Reed&quot;, who &quot;is resigned and may not practice law in California.&quot; Since 1999, inactive since 1997 even.</p>

<p>Edit2: Apparently, Spire Law LLP was previously <a href="http://www.dobielaw.org/">Mitchell J. Stein &amp; Associates LLP</a>, <a href="http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-mortgage-law-firms-raided,0,2702378.story">who have been sued</a> for &quot;fraudulently [inducing] struggling homeowners nationwide to pay thousands of dollars each to file mass lawsuits against their mortgage lenders.&quot; Can&#39;t find the result of that suit, though.</p>

<p>Edit3: Further googling reveals more allegations against them. In general they appear to be incompetent at best and fraudulent at worst, making absurd promises to clients suing banks and others in relation to the financial crisis. California State Bar says Mitchell J. Stein is &quot;Not Eligible To Practice Law&quot; since the beginning of 2012, though it&#39;s hard to tell if he&#39;s still involved with this as the website doesn&#39;t list a single name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because <em>it is Spire Law&#39;s press release</em>.</p>

<p>No news organization ever really wrote about this themselves. Spire Law released <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/major-banks-governmental-officials-and-their-comrade-capitalists-targets-of-spire-law-group-llps-racketeering-and-money-laundering-lawsuit-seeking-return-of-43-trillion-to-the-united-states-treasury-175828861.html">this statement</a> through PR Newswire, which you can pay to publish your press releases. PR Newswire syndicates to Comtex, which in turn CNBC and Marketwatch are subscribed to and copied the press release verbatim from. No one but Spire Law themselves had any input on the article, that&#39;s why it is such a mess.</p>

<p>Now Marketwatch actually states that it&#39;s a press release and displays the PR Newswire and Comtex logos, but CNBC just published it as a normal news piece apart from the &quot;/PRNewswire via COMTEX/&quot; at the start of the article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spire Law&#39;s press release says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In connection with the federal lawsuit now impending in the United States District Court in Brooklyn, New York (Case No. 12-cv-04269-JBW-RML) – involving, among other things, a request that the District Court enjoin all mortgage foreclosures by the Banksters nationwide, unless and until the entire $43 trillion is repaid to a court-appointed receiver – Plaintiffs  now establish the location of the $43 trillion ($43,000,000,000,000.00) of laundered money in a racketeering enterprise participated in by the following individuals [three billion names...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That case number brings up <a href="http://www.supremelaw.org/cc/abeel/COMPLAINT.pdf">this complaint document</a>, which appears to have been filed in April. It cites the index number 500827/2012, but looking that up <a href="http://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcivil/FCASSearch">here</a> just brings up an unrelated small claims case against the town of Monroe. Maybe I just don&#39;t understand how NY court case and index numbers work, though. I&#39;m also unable to find the case by searching for the firm or the first plaintiff in the complaint (Abeel).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, and that&#39;s why $43 trillion is not <em>that</em> insane of a number. The LIBOR scandal implicated the Fed and most of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealers#Current_list">primary dealers</a>, the banks who directly benefit from the Fed&#39;s zero interest rate policy (read: cut in on the counterfeiting ring) and exposed the manipulating of the LIBOR rate which was the basis for a derivative market valued at <strong>$350 trillion - $1.2 quadrillion</strong>, depending on the source. Changing just a ten-thousandth of a percentage could potentially yield them millions, if not <em>billions</em> in extorted wealth, on a consistent basis since likely around 2008. Still, I don&#39;t think this case is real, as much as I wish it was. We&#39;ll see what happens I suppose.</p>
