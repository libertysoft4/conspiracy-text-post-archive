<p>Obama increased civil liberties compared to bush.  Even heard of warrantless wiretapping? It ended under Obama</p>

<p>Romney has a chance because of citizen united, voting fraud, and because he is a clever little weasel with the rest of the neocons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libya, Syria, continuation of Homeland Security, Guantanamo, Drone Strikes, Fake Bin laden raid, the Goldman Sachs bailout etc... On the other hand Obama has at least given lip service to being secular and socially progressive, has resisted the right wing branch of the Israeli lobby their call for airstrikes on Iran, and we have not had any self inflicted attacks like WTC 93, TWA 800, the Oklahoma Federal building bombing, or 911 on Obamas watch. I would say in many ways Obama has not been as traitorous as Bill Clinton or Cheney Rumsfeld.
I personally see Romney and his big supporters and backers as much worse than what we are getting with Obama. Don&#39;t get me wrong they are all destroying America and mass killers in thier own way but the neo conservatives that will follow Romney into the  White House are probably going to be worse than I can imagine.
Also for the record I think Romney is going to win the election based on polling, early voting and Republican voting fraud. </p>

Meanwhile we are supporting Sunni Wahhabi overthrows of Shia controlled or friendly countries while uprising in Bahrain, Jordan and Kuwait are ignored.

    <div class="md"><p>People in this subreddit are more open-minded, and dare I say, smarter than you are. </p>

<p>As a non-American who has followed US politics closely for over two decades, I had high hopes for Obama in 2008 after the clown show of GWB. </p>

<p>However, Obama&#39;s four years has been a crushing failure - a disaster every bit as bad as Bush. He has destroyed more civil liberties than Bush managed in 8 years and anyone else before him. If you doubt that, do some research on NDAA 2012.</p>

<p>Yes, most of the rest of the world reside under the misapprehension that Obama is a great guy (and maybe he is), but they are unaware of how frankly, toxic his political legacy will be. </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I am fairly certain that Romney will be every bit as bad as Obama - the US electorate have a real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_fork">Morton&#39;s fork</a> of a choice in this election. </p>

<p>So take a step back and do some research what Obama has really achieved - it&#39;s not pretty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t be brainwashed by a multitude of information. I avoid getting information from only one source so my mind stays open. Even then I still question everything I read. I&#39;m sorry if you feel that my comment is offending to you, but you&#39;re being an asshole by judging a whole group of people. </p>

<p>You post because you want people to respond. You&#39;re not always going to like responses. Where are your facts? Sources from non-bias outlets? If you take the time out of your day to do some real research and post some legitimate sources with questions and an open approach, you might realize that you currently aren&#39;t digging deep enough. </p>

<p>Edit: I feel I should add I don&#39;t think I am impenetrable when it comes to extreme opinions, but I actively make sure I keep myself in check quite frequently. Everyone is susceptible to being a bit extreme every once in a while. I know I can be.</p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t readily apparent you should really do some more research because this is conspiracy 101. They&#39;re a one trick pony.

Honest question: do you watch mainstream media? I don&#39;t want to degrade you, but I want to know what kind of perspective you&#39;re coming from. It&#39;s a bit befuddling to me why this matters to you. You just hand over your rights for what you deserve as a citizen and just deal with what we&#39;re all being dealt? Attempting to rationalize with the side that doesn&#39;t give two craps about you?</p>

Obama has expanded the Drone war, Expanded the war in Afghanistan, and continued the bush policies domestically ( i.e. total police state).  Guess I lost your respect.  Oh well.  Now tell me how is he &quot;better?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Better at hiding the evil that he is?  Yeah.  You know, you&#39;re right.  I have to agree with you on that one.  He <em>is</em> better than Bush in that respect.</p>

<p>I think, however, that what he&#39;s better than Bush at doing (hiding his evil) actually makes him <em>worse</em> than Bush...if that&#39;s even possible (which I didn&#39;t think it was until Barry came along).</p>
