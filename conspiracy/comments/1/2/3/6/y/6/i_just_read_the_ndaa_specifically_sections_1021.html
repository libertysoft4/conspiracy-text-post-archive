        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In section 1021, it states:</p>

<p>(a) IN GENERAL.—Congress affirms that the authority of the President to use all necessary and appropriate force pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) includes the authority for the Armed Forces of the United States to detain covered persons (as defined in subsection (b)) pending disposition under the law of war.</p>

<p>(b) COVERED PERSONS.—A covered person under this section is any person as follows:
(1) A person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored those responsible for those attacks.
(2) A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces.</p>

<p>But then in Section 1022, the bill states that:</p>

<p>(b) APPLICABILITY TO UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND LAWFUL RESIDENT ALIENS.—
(1) UNITED STATES CITIZENS.—The requirement to detain a person in military custody under this section does not extend to citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>If it does not pertain to US citizens or Legal US Aliens, why is there such a problem with the bill?</p>

<p>I might not be used to reading bills enough, and feel free to call me stupid. I&#39;m just curious if I&#39;m reading this wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - they are doing this because this same power exists within the patriot act and they are trying to have it established in law so that the courts can deal with the constitutional legality. The way the power is established in the patriot act is such that secret national security courts are used, shielding it from the normal judicial review process. Meaning that this type of activity cannot be determined to be illegal by a court without someone including it legislation without the secret court provision of the patriot act. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone held under the current provisions of the patriot act can be tried in a secret court, under the ndaa legislation that would now be a regular court. </p>

<p>You act as if the NDAA is the only thing that violates habeus corpus when the patriot act already does. Seeing as the patriot act isn&#39;t getting appealed anytime soon it&#39;s fairly important to have that process exposed to the normal judicial system instead of the backroom national security courts. </p>

<p>Your argument isn&#39;t very nuanced and subsequently isn&#39;t very likely to convince a judge, who has spent most of his life practicing law, who is likely aware of examples where suspending habeus corpus <em>may</em> have been warranted. That is not to say he is right, but that it&#39;s obvious not every judge errs on this side of the issue. </p>

<p>Exposing such powers is necessary in order for the courts to handle the issue. They have already existed for a number of years, and it can be argued for even longer. With the powers now exposed those arguments can be had left, right, and center.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t making an argument.  I&#39;m just trying to understand.  You said they are doing this because &quot;they are trying to have it established in law so that the courts can deal with the constitutional legality&quot;.  </p>

<p>So the only way to deal with the constitutional legality of indefinite detention (something that already exists in the Patriot Act, but dealt with in secret courts) is to fight for it to stay in the NDAA, dealt with in regular courts?  Is that what you&#39;re saying?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is not what I&#39;m saying. I think you also misunderstood my use of the word argument.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that doing it this way opens up many many many more avenues for challenging the law. </p>

<p>You can try and bring suit against the government saying that a law is unconstitutional, but such successes are rare. And even then, it would help to have examples of its use. With the secret courts you couldn&#39;t do a lot of that. </p>

<p>With the NDAA explicitly involving the weasel words used to grant the president such powers, the judicial branch can clearly say &quot;hell no&quot;, or otherwise. And yeah, they are going to appeal it to as high of a court as possible because that is how you get lasting precedent set. You also have to make a robust defense of the law. A supreme court decision on the NDAA would put those parts of the patriot act to rest. Probably even a decision from a lesser court would do too.</p>

<p>You see, it&#39;s hard to stop someone from being illegaly detained when you have these people secretly tried in a system created by the same weird interpretation that allows their detainment in the first place. You can&#39;t go to the judge and say &quot;he should be free because duh&quot;. They are in a secret court operating under the principal that these people are <em>threats</em>. In the case of guantanamo guys, it was that they are foreign terrorists. In the case of an NDAA example might be that they are domestic terrorists. I imagine that you can understand it would be quite hard to argue these cases against the government, as blatantly wrong as some of them might be. Obtaining evidence would be difficult and who knows what kind of bullshit the gov&#39;t would make up. Even still, a lot of those guantanamo guys are gone because the gov&#39;t really did have no evidence. But you can be sure that anyone with a <strong>legitimate</strong> suspicion is still there. </p>

<p>Now any NDAA case can be appealed and argued. Yes, it does seem weird. But you kinda have to think about this because it&#39;s the big boys league. This is where the guys enacting the conspiracies that then become our theories work. If the gov&#39;t was already, or had the possibility of misinterpreting a provision of the patriot act through some inner memo (ala how they determined torture was perfectly legal), then how else could you stop it? Write another memo? That wont work, they will just write another for the next president. Appeal? Well they are secret courts in bizarro land so that wont really apply to anything. Explicitly stating the misinterpretation and having open courts deny it is the most effective way. </p>

<p>Before you had secret courts with basically no oversight. Now you have the regular old judicial system where every case can be appealed to the top based upon its own merits. </p>

1. This as a codification of existing laws; 
2. Because the MCA authorizes the military trial of persons who “purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents; 
3. The 2009 DOJ brief, stating, The President . . . has the authority under the AUMF to detain in this armed conflict those persons whose relationship to al-Qaida or the Taliban would, in appropriately analogous circumstances in a traditional international armed conflict, render them detainable.........this can include not only persons who are part of such armed forces, but also some persons who “substantially support” those forces;
