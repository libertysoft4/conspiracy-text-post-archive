        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">98</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-10-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/dudewheresmyreality.html">dudewheresmyreality</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is a quick aggregate of strange and surprising facts as well as theories that relate to the idea of an anomalous hurricane disaster.  The theory is the belief that a weather system can be steered, augmented, and manipulated in such a way to be controlled with technology.  The claimed purpose would be to cause a disaster, use the ensuing chaos to institute martial law, and gain total control of the population, while others suggest an election connection.  Why any of this makes sense only becomes arguable when assumed that our society is on the brink of collapse.  This, being the preemptive action in light of that realization.  However, that is a pretty big assumption to come to.</p>

<p>Also, it is fair to point out that there are conspiracy theories for just about anything and everything.  And if you find enough “data points” and connect the dots you can reach a very interesting narrative.</p>

<p><strong>Strange occurrences of days past:</strong></p>

<p><strong>23 days ago:</strong> This <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1107zp/hear_say_about_the_east_coast/">user</a> on reddit claims to have been contacted by a reliable family friend who had been called into a military briefing regarding a probable evacuation scenario for the east coast due to an unknown disaster causing massive floods.  The proposed time line in the post does coincide with this hurricane.  Creepy, but hard to find credible.</p>

<p><strong>31 days ago:</strong>  “<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037603_FEMA_mass_fatalities_planning.html#ixzz29lvZ7X8D">House Resolution 6566</a> is introduced by congress, also known as the Mass Fatality Planning and Religious Considerations Act, would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to mandate that FEMA immediately begin conducting ‘mass fatality planning’.”</p>

<p><strong>In recent years:</strong>  The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FnZLx8J4oM">discovery</a> of stockpiles of FEMA cadaver <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17690179/Multi-Functional-Cremation-Container-For">coffins</a>, and their rumored <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/conspiracy-theories/2012/10/500000-fema-coffins-now-gone-where-are-they-2445300.html">transport</a> “north” from <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8f7_1350061865">Georgia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How do they think this is possible?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program">HAARP</a> is a military funded research program along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency">DARPA</a> which uses high frequency radio transmitters to collect data on the ionosphere.  It does this by sending concentrated and/or continuous high-frequency pulses into specific sections of the ionosphere with the intent to agitate it. The official purpose of this program is to conduct research and collect data to help advance the performance and reliability of communications, satellites, and the accuracy of GPS and other various research instruments.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists suspect because of the military and DARPA’s involvement in this program that it is not only for data collection, but for the actual experimentation for the purpose of manipulating the ionosphere along with weather conditions to “weaponize” mother nature.  The act of controlling, influencing, and manipulating the weather is often referred to as “weather modification” and even has a provision in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Modification_Convention">Geneva Conventions</a> condemning its use in war.  According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification">wikipedia</a> on weather modification, it is something that has been discussed in the UN as far back as 1975.  This is no longer a hypothetical idea of the imagination, however, the extent of its effectiveness can only be speculated.</p>

<p>One <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNxhfp-KwBQ&amp;t=12m54s">theory</a> regarding HAARP is that by targeting concentrated sections of the ionosphere with the intent to agitate it there is potential to even heat up specific sections and effectively displace entire columns of the atmosphere due to the temperature change.  By displacing large columns of the atmosphere one would be able to influence pressure systems and jet streams and thereby have the ability to strengthen, weaken, and steer hurricanes.</p>

<p><strong>But why?</strong></p>

<p>Usually conspiracy theories are all based around the idea that someone is benefiting or someone profits from it.  For this reason the purpose of this theory isn’t too clear.  It seems pretty drastic and more of an “End Game” scenario where the only purpose is for control.  So to believe this one you would really have to be convinced that either the financial system is teetering to the point of collapse making monetary profit irrelevant and chaos imminent or resources have become so limited that there is a need to control the population size in order to sustain the “western lifestyle” for that much longer.</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>It started out pretty damn interesting with some weird occurrences and legit creepy facts, but there are just so many assumptions that have to be made, and some drastic ones at that, that it becomes increasingly unbelievable.  But at the same time some of the cold hard facts are even unbelievable too.  It&#39;s confusing.</p>

<p>By the way, don’t be stupid.  Prepare yourself at the very least to be without power.  I don’t understand people who say “Irene wasn’t bad so this one won’t be bad either” or any other statement along those lines.  It is almost nonsensical to compare one hurricane to another and to base your judgment on that.  This is weather we’re talking about, not cars coming off an assembly line that we expect to be consistent.  If there is anything we can all see from the last couple years is that the weather has been doing some funky things.</p>

<p>Last year all I did was buy beer, candles, and drugs.  It was definitely fun, but I also should probably be dead.  Also, when you don’t have power and can’t cook food it is also highly probable that chinese takeout will be unable to deliver food to you.  Seems obvious.  Yeah, I should be dead.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Oh, also forgot the DHS purchasing a <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2012/08/putting-1-4-billion-rounds-into-perspective-along-with-the-1400-lbs-of-high-tech-explosives-dhs-just-ordered-videos-2458214.html">stockpile</a> of ammunition.  May also relate to this list.  What other things can we shove in here?  Alex Jones&#39; national guard <a href="http://www.infowars.com/national-guard-whistleblower-doomsday-preppers-will-be-treated-as-terrorists/">whistleblower</a>?  Also, it may give this national guardsman some credibility since they are being <a href="http://www.nyalert.gov/Public/News/AllHazPRView.aspx?notID=3730661&amp;refer=HOME&amp;source=WEB&amp;messageID=AghxO4T6A&amp;">mobilized</a> here in NY and all over the NE in lieu of Sandy.  Yes, it&#39;s standard during times of crisis, but perhaps the timing of his coming forward along with the subject of his message isn&#39;t just coincidence.  Just sayin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might believe that we can generate hurricanes and control the weather to an extent... but to be able to steer it? Starting around Africa?  Wouldn&#39;t you have to displace the atmosphere continually along the path to get it exactly where you wanted it to go?  It looks, at the moment, like it will hit around Atlantic City?  Why not New York City for the royal flush.</p>

<p>I live on the south shore of Long Island and a lot is a stake. Got my beer and my greens, but I&#39;m an upstater and this is new.  Hope my peanuts, bananas and bread are enough for a bit! </p>

<p>But, like I was saying, there is a lot at stake.  That&#39;s why I think there is a glimmer of truth to this theory. How accurate is long-range weather forcasting?  Accurate enough to predict the upcoming jet stream, simply (ha.. simply) create the hurricane and wait, knowing that it will be pulled, unnaturally, westward into the northeast coast?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The technology we have is 20 years behind the technology &quot;they&quot; have. That&#39;s how I justify it, and I have no real proof. It&#39;s a theory. Heck, Japan is 4 or 5 years ahead of us when it comes to cellphones. We&#39;re light years beyond what North Korea allows their people to own and do with their life. I am a firm believer that a lot of the technology / amenities we know about had to be &quot;approved&quot; by the FCC or FDA, etc... Not everything makes it to market or sees the light of day. A good example would be Tesla&#39;s free energy discovery and ultimately being screwed by JP Morgan in the end because it came down to profits. I&#39;m sure that technology wasn&#39;t forgotten about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where you&#39;re coming from (I didn&#39;t downvote you). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory">Wikipedia states</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A scientific theory is &quot;a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading that made me question what &quot;natural world&quot; really means. <a href="http://www.rationalskepticism.org/philosophy/what-is-the-natural-world-t22503.html">This sums</a> it up best in my head:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The natural world is all matter and energy, including all the matter and energy in other universes, if there is a multiverse&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess where I&#39;m coming from is more hypothetical than anything else.   </p>

<p>The scientific method follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Formulate a question</li>
<li>Hypothesis</li>
<li>Prediction</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Analysis </li>
</ol>

<p>I have questions. I&#39;m still working on the hypothesis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on Icke&#39;s lizard meme is this: the people and organizations he is exposing act very reptilian; that is, they only care about eating, fucking, and hunting their prey with a certain amount of cunning and venom.  The mind will present hard-to-understand impressions as symbols.  David icke&#39;s mind sees these forces and entities as lizards since that is what they most closely resemble to his universe of discourse.</p>

<p>Of course, I could be wrong, and there might actually be shape shifting lizard men controlling all of the world&#39;s governments from behind the scenes; feeding off &quot;negative energy&quot; and conducting blood sacrifice rituals in praise to forgotten gods and demons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re misinformed how daemons work...</p>

<p>They&#39;re not mythical evil creatures that come and go as they please.  They&#39;re kind of trapped.  Imagine having no access to your senses, just sitting nearly alone in the dark.  That&#39;s life for 99% of the Daemon race.</p>

<p>However, very rarely when the universe in its eternal shuffle lines up in just the right way, they can sort of brush our world.  Semi solid state, probably some physics explanation but I&#39;m not a physics major.  Either way, long story short, they can latch onto what little exostential potential we humans have and form a semi-permanent bond.  </p>

<p>Basically, when I was born, I was late.  REALLY late.  Doctors were performing a C-section, but according to my parents, they weren&#39;t sure I was going to be alright.  Tryst stumbles into reality, and latches onto the first thing she&#39;s able to touch in the last several billion years or so, and that happens to be me.  Bond forms, we connect, and I survived the csection.  </p>

<p>So we&#39;re linked until I die.  Or she gets out.  Probably not going to get out ever.  That God guy knows how to do banishment.  Long and short of this link, is that I get access to her vitality, she gets access to physical sensations we take for granted, sight/sound/taset/touch, all that jazz.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not surprised you&#39;re worried, the church has been brainwashing generations to keep even these little contacts contained.  Its honestly inhuman what&#39;s been done to the daemon race.</p>

<p>As for the election theory, why would either of them want to do it? Why would Romney or people who want him to win trigger a disaster, the type of thing that cements an incumbent&#39;s support? If it&#39;s not caused by the president, anything terrible that happens to the country rallies everyone to support him. So maybe Obama did it? Why the fuck would Obama, on pace to win the election relatively easily barring any unforeseen game-changers, use science not even perceived to be anywhere close to where we&#39;re really at to trigger the biggest unforeseen game-changer in the history of the US and will kill tons of people? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then I suppose starting with the north east wouldn&#39;t be a bad start. Home of the most populated city in the country.  The ny metropolitan area is home to over 18million.  In theory if population control is the reason you would want to hit the most densely populated city first while the residents are still skeptical about a natural disasters effect and less likely to evacuate or even prepare.  If for example a massive earthquake hit the west coast killing thousands and then the north east was warned of &quot;Frankenstorm&quot;, you can expect a lot more people to take it seriously. Again, in theory, if this was a series of &quot;weather&quot; attacks. NY makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty out there that explain how weather manipulation is done, and possible to a large extent. </p>

<p>Recently a UofU study found a direct link to occurrences in the <a href="http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/stratosphere-targets-deep-sea-to-shape-climate/">stratosphere and the circulation patterns in the deep sea</a>. If we were to be able to manipulate the patterns in the stratosphere, we could manipulate patterns in the sea. So can we manipulate those patterns? <a href="http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/stratosphere-targets-deep-sea-to-shape-climate/">Of course we can!</a> Cloud seeding is nothing hidden or new. It&#39;s also been used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_warfare">warfare</a>. If the ability to manipulate the weather, and use it for purposeful destruction, wasn&#39;t even fathomable, then why would the Geneva Convention care to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Modification_Convention">prohibit hostile use of weather manipulation</a> in 1977?!? They may as well prohibit the use of Sasquatch breeding, commet steering or light sabers in warfare - were it not possible. </p>

<p>There is plenty to be found about the possible ways in which HAARP could manipulate weather. Why they would, well... thats anyone&#39;s guess from moment to moment, but to dismiss the possibilities is to succumb to ignorance. </p>

<p>HAARP is no secret and is easily accessible to the population so it really IS your choice to stay ignorant on the matter. This is just perfect for the people in control because now it gives them something else to work with to distract the population from the election and worry about food/shelter/water and then rebuilding. </p>

<p>As far as the prediction goes...creepy indeed...I suppose we will have to wait and see what happens with all the FEMA bullshit. America the dumb and docile will believe anything the MSM throws at them.</p>

I haven&#39;t heard the drone thing but it makes sense that they will use them to monitor the storm and damages/rescue efforts after.  So they hope people will start to like drones because they helped out. Couple this with the recent theft of 75% of SC&#39;s SSNs, you have support for government surveillance and things like PIPA, SOPA, etc.  Also, he can say &quot;I was dealing with the hurricane instead of dealing with the election, I care more about Americans than I do about being elected.&quot; Thus, he sways some swing voters.  </p>

<p>But I will be interested to see the damage from the storm.  The more damaging the more I&#39;ll believe it was created, given that if they knew it was going to be bad and had time to plan, then they can handle the recovery extremely (better than they should be able to) well.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the zerohedge comments, don&#39;t know the source. but very interesting stuff...</p>

<p><em>It appears Sandy has about 4 hours left before crossing the sharp SST gradient defining the Gulf Stream. That will signal the end of intensifying any further, tropically. But this is when baroclinic energy will really start hitting the storm.
It almost defies logic, this storm. Think about it...
For the last 4 days there&#39;s been something going against this storm which would have killed off most other storms but, conversely, there was also some atmospheric mechanism at play counteracting its main hindrance.
It went through the roughest terrain of Cuba, but did so as an intensifying, accelerating storm. Came through on the other side only 5kt weaker than she went in.
Then Sandy met the upper low over the southeastern Gulf. Extremely dry air through a deep layer of the atmosphere, 50kts of shear. Piece of cake. She&#39;ll just place herself within the divergent sector of the shear pattern to maintain.
Found a small niche and changed just enough, structurally, to develop an inner core just as she hit the Gulf Stream, to maximize as best a storm of this size could, the additional heat energy provided.
This brings us to where we are at present and in the near future. Leaving the Gulf Stream, yes, but entering a baroclinic environment ripe for explosive development of a cyclone transitioning from tropical to extra-tropical.
Every time this storm met a challenge; mountains, shear, dry air, cold waters, it not only shrugged it off, but grew stronger. It&#39;s like this storm is destined to chart a course for the worst-case scenario.
That brings us to tonight when the storm is expected to make landfall. High tide. High astronomical tide. Right angle to the coastline. Bottlenecks and bays. Most densely populated region of the country. Record IKE. A once-in-200 year wind event in a region inland clear cut since the last big event such as this (before any reliable records were kept).</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Directing a hurricane toward the Northeast would be huge for business. And it has been. It gets the economic waterwheel moving. All the cash generated from insurance claims, and reconstruction/landscaping contracts. The fact that every home depot has sold out of generators and grocery store selves are barren. That&#39;s billions and billions in revenue. At this point, the cost of manipulating weather is probably worth it to them in order to stimulate the economy by the 10&#39;s of billions.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say it was right, just that for us to be taken seriously we need to look at ALL sides of something. It is pretty obvious that TPTB want to deem everything &quot;climate change&quot;, when there is very clearly evidence of changes unrelated to our atmosphere&#39;s CO2 content. Do I think climate change is a complete hoax? I don&#39;t really know anymore, but I&#39;m not at the point where I&#39;d say that. Although I am <em>certain</em> that the changes going on around the earth are NOT a result of <em>only</em> CO2 increase. <em>And</em> we still haven&#39;t figured out <em>why</em> they would engineer, or steer, or increase the size of this superstorm, so I think it is just as plausible that they could have been trying to minimize the size of it (obviously not for the sake of being &quot;good guys&quot; or, as you said, we would have heard about it). </p>

<p>This whole deal with climate change seems fishy in regards to a possible problem-reaction-solution situation, just as went on with the false flag of 9/11 and (the solution) the war in the middle east. Just hypothesize for a second that climate change as a result of emissions isn&#39;t real but they are trying to make us believe it is real. But they can&#39;t be <em>too</em> pushy about it, or more people would get suspicious, so climate change is &quot;under the radar&quot; in many senses, not discussed at the debates, etc. Once it gets to the point that we are <em>demanding</em> that climate change be addressed and &quot;green jobs&quot; and all this other stuff they say &quot;okay okay fine&quot;, and then we play right into there hand. The only thing I&#39;m missing is what they could possibly benefit from &quot;green jobs&quot; which I have yet to figure out, and it seems pretty hard to figure out. But these people have decades to work out the logistics of these &quot;plans&quot;, and it would be silly to think that some guys on the internet could figure it out in a single conversation. But just because we can&#39;t figure it out doesn&#39;t make it any less of something to look at. I mean they control the media, and big oil, mainstream everything pretty much, and when you see companies like shell putting commercials out about green jobs and helping the climate change, it should cause everyone to raise an eyebrow and think &quot;what is the agenda here?&quot;.</p>

<p>ATK sells them a shit load of bullets for a discount since they bought so many, DHS eats it up. They don&#39;t even have to fulfill the entire contract, they <em>can</em> purchase up to x amount of bullets via the contract, so it&#39;s possible they just got a great deal out of it.</p>

<p>They do need <strong>a lot</strong> of bullets to train though. Although the two huge contracts are pretty excessive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t think anyone actually mentioned that. But yes. The path is strange and had to have a multiple storm/pressure systems affecting each other in the right way to achieve that result. Rare but not impossible naturally. Our world is becoming a strange place where it seems more and more unlikely things seem to happen that it gets hard to tell which are natural anomalies vs influenced anomalies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. Only happens rarely. But I looked through hurricane paths in the past 10 years or so, and nothing can be compared. It&#39;s quite odd. Also thought it was funny the other hurricane that was supposedly named &quot;sandy&quot; as well, that everyone thinks was a practice run, is unnamed on the official hurricane tracking site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Hurricane Sandy is indeed a &#39;weaponized&#39; hurricane, do you think it&#39;s just a coincidence that it is happening right before the election? Do you think it could be a way for Obama to secure his reelection?</p>

<p>EDIT: I realize this is a stretch and that he most likely didn&#39;t cause it. But if the storm ends up being really bad, and he is able to handle the situation well, it will definitely help him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re right. I just wanted to mention the coincidence that it is happening very close to the election. He most likely didn&#39;t cause it (I should have said that I realize it&#39;s a stretch), but if it ends up being bad, and he handles the whole situation really well, it will definitely benefit him. It just came to mind since Bush was criticized a lot over his handling (or lack of handling) of Hurricane Katrina. America wants to feel safe in a disaster, so if the storm is bad, and Obama actually does something to help, Americans will have that in mind on November 6.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait Wait Wait... you&#39;re telling me that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has plans in place for mass casualty situations? Get right out of town!</p>

<p>And a reddit user said that a family friend who is in the military got briefed on an &#39;unknown disaster&#39; which would cause massive floods on the east Coast? I wonder if a hurricane would qualify as an &#39;unknown disaster.&#39; The reddit user probably meant a legion of floating assholes that would flood the streets with baby diarrhea, you know, the really green kind.</p>

<p>Good thing you have a wikipedia source to back up the argument about weather modification! Also the fact that the source link for the hurricane modifying section is dead, and was to a sensationalist pseudo-science documentary anyway only serves to better demonstrate how our state led media has us by the balls and is drip feeding us bullshit about why earthquakes and hurricanes happen.</p>

<p>Finally, it seems like a certainty that martial law will be declared because of this. Probably worldwide martial law at that. Lets face it, if a hurricane is going to hit New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, it might as well hit the whole fucking world because those are the only places that matter. We&#39;ll be calling Chris Christie &#39;Supreme Chancellor&#39; before the week is out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say it was right, just that for us to be taken seriously we need to look at ALL sides of something. It is pretty obvious that TPTB want to deem everything &quot;climate change&quot;, when there is very clearly evidence of changes unrelated to our atmosphere&#39;s CO2 content. Do I think climate change is a complete hoax? I don&#39;t really know anymore, but I&#39;m not at the point where I&#39;d say that. Although I am <em>certain</em> that the changes going on around the earth are NOT a result of <em>only</em> CO2 increase. <em>And</em> we still haven&#39;t figured out <em>why</em> they would engineer, or steer, or increase the size of this superstorm, so I think it is just as plausible that they could have been trying to minimize the size of it (obviously not for the sake of being &quot;good guys&quot; or, as you said, we would have heard about it). </p>

<p>This whole deal with climate change seems fishy in regards to a possible problem-reaction-solution situation, just as went on with the false flag of 9/11 and (the solution) the war in the middle east. Just hypothesize for a second that climate change as a result of emissions isn&#39;t real but they are trying to make us believe it is real. But they can&#39;t be <em>too</em> pushy about it, or more people would get suspicious, so climate change is &quot;under the radar&quot; in many senses, not discussed at the debates, etc. Once it gets to the point that we are <em>demanding</em> that climate change be addressed and &quot;green jobs&quot; and all this other stuff they say &quot;okay okay fine&quot;, and then we play right into there hand. The only thing I&#39;m missing is what they could possibly benefit from &quot;green jobs&quot; which I have yet to figure out, and it seems pretty hard to figure out. But these people have decades to work out the logistics of these &quot;plans&quot;, and it would be silly to think that some guys on the internet could figure it out in a single conversation. But just because we can&#39;t figure it out doesn&#39;t make it any less of something to look at. I mean they control the media, and big oil, mainstream everything pretty much, and when you see companies like shell putting commercials out about green jobs and helping the climate change, it should cause everyone to raise an eyebrow and think &quot;what is the agenda here?&quot;.</p>
