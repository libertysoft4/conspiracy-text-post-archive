        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some people are natural skeptics who exercise critical thinking on important issues.  Then you have people who automatically argue EVERY-FUCKING-EVENT with an elaborate, paranoid counter-theory, which makes it easier for the Powers that Be to make all skeptics look &quot;crazy&quot;.  </p>

<p>Just for fun, here&#39;s a list of the conspiracy theories I find to be either 1.) Unimportant/inconsequential or 2.) Wrong/batshit crazy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The &quot;Illuminati&quot;</strong> - While there are some elements of truth behind it, the discussion of secret societies, hand gestures, etc make this one seem ridiculous.  Youtube is littered with talk of devil worship and symbolism that detracts from the actual evils these people are committing.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aliens</strong> - Again, probably some elements of truth, but mostly bunk.  It&#39;s fine to discuss the possibility of life outside of earth, but not when it obscures the more important discussion of what ACTUAL HUMANS are doing to each other/the planet.  Seriously, step away from the sci-fi nonsense.  Aliens--at least the ones portrayed in movies and TV shows--are no more real than vampires, unicorns or jackelopes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HIV/AIDS Denialists</strong> - No.  Just no.  Again, saying HIV doesn&#39;t exist pulls focus from more important discussion, like WHERE IT CAME FROM and how it adapted to spread via human-to-human contact so suddenly.  Meanwhile, AIDS deniers (and their unfortunate children) are dying.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The &quot;Gay Agenda&quot; Homophobes</strong> - These people would be funny if they weren&#39;t so goddamn ridiculous.  In case you haven&#39;t seen them on Youtube, there are people (mostly Black men and conservative Christians from the South) who are so obsessed with finding gay subtext in every piece of pop culture that they focus more energy on it than gay people do on being gay.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>9/11 Truthers</strong> - Before you bash me, let me say I also question the official version of events.  But meanwhile the world moves on.  Focusing exclusively on any single historical event takes away focus from the present, which is every bit as fucked up as the past...maybe more.  Like the JFK/RFK/MLK assassinations, 9/11 will never be satisfactorily solved...and if it is, no one will be punished for it.  Why not put that energy toward preventing the next orchestrated catastrophe or denouncing the after-effects of the event (in this case, war, domestic surveillance and other losses of freedom)?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just a few examples.  What would you add to the list?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy crap how can you throw the 9/11 Truth Movement with that? 9/11 is what has kicked off endless wars for Israel, the whole police surveillance state and erosion of rights. It has also shown how completely controlled the Main Stream Media is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I view the Truth Movement similar to how I view Occupy Wallstreet:  well-intentioned but not organized enough to get things done.  Everyone has their own &quot;theory&quot; about what happened that day...there are literally hundreds of videos on Youtube alone.  </p>

<p>The truthers aren&#39;t wrong for not believing the official story, or for demanding answers.  Where it falls apart for me is that, in 2012, people are still dissecting every detail of that day as if they have all the answers while arguing among themselves about who&#39;s right.  Meanwhile, the Patriot Act was renewed, the NDAA was signed, hundreds of medical marijuana raids went down and we continue to lose more of our freedoms every day with comparatively little outrage.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the current Mossad/CIA theory is probably the best, and note that it was not nearly as popular about 2 years ago. Some of the theories are &quot;nutty&quot; sure, but some of them hold up much better under scrutiny than the original theory. I think over a third of the U.S believe it was an inside job or known about in advance. This wouldn&#39;t be possible without us talking about it. The present is directly caused by 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the links.  I&#39;ve done a lot of reading about HIV/AIDS and find other hypotheses much more believable than the &quot;HIV does not = AIDS&quot; theories.  </p>

<p>The origins of AIDS interest me most.  The bushmeat theory that&#39;s widely accepted by scientists could not possibly be true.  Africans have hunted/eaten monkeys for millennia and still do to this day.  So why did HIV only become an epidemic in the last part of the 20th century?  The fact that a small portion of Africans are infected with SIV today and are not sick tells me that SIV in itself is neither highly contagious or fatal* (see below).  </p>

<p>So what allowed it to mutate into the deadly HIV, which is easily spread from person to person?  </p>

<p>The most likely scenario is that the re-use of unsterile needles during African vaccination campaigns and/or the use of chimp kidneys to cultivate vaccines is what allowed SIV to become the HIV we know today.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnclyGq6SAY">This</a> is the best documentary I&#39;ve seen on the subject.</p>

<p>Both the oral polio vaccine (the CHAT vaccine used in Africa) and the Hepatitis B vaccine--which was originally made from the pooled blood of 30 of promiscuous gay men with Hepatitis B--could have easily spread the disease to hundreds of people at once, explaining the explosion of AIDS cases in the early &#39;80s.</p>

<p>Personal opinion: the AIDS denialism seems like a disinformation campaign (started by government officials?) in an attempt to distract from the REAL issue--that medical negligence and unethical practices facilitated the spread of the disease.  Simple discussion about the safety of vaccines is considered blasphemy due to the fear of causing &quot;panic&quot; and people not vaccinating their kids.  Health officials and the media go to great lengths to suppress open debate and persecute those who suggest a link between vaccines and health problems.           </p>

<ul>
<li><em>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_HIV/AIDS#Theories_of_HIV_origin_and_epidemic_emergence">Wikipedia</a>:  *In agreement with this model is also the fact that, while both HIV-1 and HIV-2 attain substantial viral loads in the human organism, SIV infecting humans seldom does so: people with SIV antibodies often have very low or even undetectable SIV viral load.  This suggests that both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are adapted to humans, and serial passage could have been the process responsible for it.</em></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So just wanted to point out that HIV/AIDS denialism is a lot more diverse than you seem to realize.... its highly improbable that denialism would be the result of government propaganda.... There are independent groups spanning the globe, independently coming up with much more plausible thesis, requiring categorically less assumptions than the virus-caused theory of AIDS. The government is pretty strongly vested in the hypothesis that HIV exists and is an infectious agent that is responsible for the mass killing of homosexuals/drug users in the early 80s.  Let&#39;s face it people, whatever initially killed those people WAS NOT what we are peddling as HIV/AIDS today. People are not dying in the droves from kaposi sarcoma (hardly any HIV+ people get that anymore) and a rare fungal pneumonia..... WITH OR WITHOUT AIDS DRUGS.  What we were fighting in the 1980s appears to be strongly correlated to either the result of a gay-men targeted vaccination program.... or infectious agents spread by a common infecting source.... perhaps contaminated recreational drugs... and the result of prescribing these people high dose poison, AZT, which was essentially AIDS/DEATH by prescription. Again, the &quot;thing&quot; we fought in the 80s is NOT what AIDS is now. That thing we fought in the 80s acts a whole lot like the result of a weaponized cancer program, that was given a test run on gays (who were really kind of despised at the time). And it explains why the government is so heavily vested in this industry. . . And it explains why Los Alamos National Laboratory is connected so closely with this disease... The French and U.S. governments, particularly the weapons research portions of these governments, are disproportionately, and suspiciously invested in the continued investment in and growth of this particular industry. </p>

<p>And I&#39;d like to point out that nothing I said up there is crazytalk that requires tons of assumptions.... it&#39;s looking at the facts and reading whats there plain as day. Asking yourself what events are far more likely to have occured... I think if you really look at it, you have to conclude that something very incongruent is going on in this industry and it is only explained by shifty dealings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the KS/pneumocystis of the &#39;80s are rare these days and think it&#39;s pretty suspicious.  Would love to hear the medical orthodoxy&#39;s take on that.          </p>

<p>The poppers/drug theory is easily debunked since not all AIDS victims used drugs.  Some sufferers were infants, sickly hemophiliacs or elderly blood transfusion recipients who absolutely did NOT get it from drug use.  </p>

<p>I find it equally likely that it was spread intentionally or by negligence via vaccines.  Either way, people should be held accountable for it.  Instead, there&#39;s a massive media blackout/tar-and-feather campaign against anyone who dares to question its origin (see: Edward Hooper).  </p>

<p>Viruses--including chimp viruses--have spread via vaccines before.  It happened with SV40 and the Salk <em>and</em> Sabin polio vaccines that were given to millions of American school children in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s.  (SV40 is believed to play a role in causing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40#p53_Damage_and_carcinogenicity">human cancer</a>).  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a nice little excerpt about the debacle from Wikipedia:</p>

<p><em>Soon after its discovery, SV40 was identified in the injected form of the polio vaccine produced between 1955 and 1961. This is believed to be due to kidney cells from infected monkeys having been used to grow the vaccine virus during production. Both the Sabin vaccine (oral, live virus) and the Salk vaccine (injectable, killed virus) were affected; the technique used to inactivate the polio virus in the Salk vaccine, by means of formaldehyde, did not reliably kill SV40.</em></p>

<p>Lovely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  Crazy to think that most of us younger folk have never known a world without AIDS.  </p>

<p>The government was extremely slow to move in the beginning, allowing it to spread far and wide.  Reagan himself never uttered the word &quot;AIDS&quot; in public until 1987.  When the media finally took interest, they only served to spread unfounded fear and panic, causing further stigmatization of gays.  Even if it wasn&#39;t deliberately introduced into the population, there certainly was a conspiracy of silence once it hit.</p>
