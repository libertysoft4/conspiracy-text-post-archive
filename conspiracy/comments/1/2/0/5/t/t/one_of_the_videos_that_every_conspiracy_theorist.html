    <div class="md"><p>The Icke video is cool because it shows him when he was first getting started and where he ended up. In the 1991 interview he is young and very determined to show people what&#39;s going on and as a result he is ridiculed. In 2006 the interview apologizes to Icke and admits that Icke had very good points. </p>

<p>As for how people feel about Icke, those that are new to conspiracies get turned off because of the &quot;reptiles&quot;, and rightfully so (i think that is the only reason he is still alive). The old school conspiracy theorists have issues with him because of what happened with Icke and his mentor.... what was his name... shit.... he is really good actually.... argh! ... help anyone... his name is... is.... (i&#39;ll have to get back to you on this... hopefully someone will fill in the blank). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came across it a few years ago so I really don&#39;t remember the details. They had a falling out. I think Maxwell just didn&#39;t like where Icke started going with the info he was learning. Could be the reptile thing, could be that Icke was paraphrasing, half truthing, i really can&#39;t remember. </p>

<p>Icke followed Maxwell&#39;s teachings. Now keep in mind that Maxwell knew way more than Icke, like a lot more. Serious respect to him. As for Icke, love the guy and he has learned a lot over the years. As far as I see it, I consider it a family issue and I don&#39;t take sides in family issues, so I slowly let the memory go. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When he is only talking about things that are verifiable and rooted in reality he is a very intelligent and well spoken man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol.  &quot;Who cares&quot;?  People looking for credibility.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s your same statement with one word changed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When he is only talking about things that are verifiable and rooted in reality, Hitler is a very intelligent and well spoken man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See how fucking retarded that sounds?  It&#39;s because Hitler WAS intelligent and well spoken.  He was also a fucking psycho and believed all kinds of dangerous things.  And spread a mountain of lies.</p>

<p>Just because David Icke once said the sky is blue, doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t a liar who professes bad science.  Your defense of Icke is willfully obtuse.  A man who champions fake science has understandably ruined his credibility and cannot be trusted to provide good testimony.</p>

<p>&quot;it doesn&#39;t take a 10 year-old...&quot;</p>

<p>Icke&#39;s breakdown during this broadcast is Conspiracy 101 - in other words, the Project for the New American Century was a red flag the moment it was created by Bill Kristol, Cheney, Libby, and all those other neo-con fuckers AND some of us are old enough to remember those days with apprehension.  I saw 9-11 coming for 10 years and so did a lot of people.  Some of us read quite a few books about pipelines across Afghanistan and the covert war with the Mujahedeen <em>while it was happening.</em>  Some who read about the privatization of the military and corruption at the Pentagon, and who watched a former Vice President get caught up in illegal arms trading with a declared enemy state to fund illegal right-wing murder squads in Central America and then become President and pardon everyone involved.  This shit has been building for decades.</p>

<p>Is Icke&#39;s rendition credible?  NO.  Why?  Because he never gets to the details, the asshole host cuts him off.  And that&#39;s where the rubber meets the road with David Icke.</p>

<p>Are there dynasties?  Yes.  Are their secret societies than transcend eras?  Certainly.  Do governments behave contemptibly towards their own citizenry, with experiments and dark researches, murder, mayhem and malice?  With haunting regularity.</p>

<p>Was 9-11 an instance of clandestine collusion?  I think that can be reasonably accepted as fact at this point.  Was Cheney in on it?  I certainly believe it, though I lack a certain amount of proof.  Regardless he is a war criminal.</p>

<p>These are pretty much the daily fare of Conspiracists or rather people who understand psy-ops and media enough to accept that real history and real truth are hidden in the era in which we find ourselves.  As Mr. Icke so elegantly put it, it should be obvious to a 10 year-old.</p>

<p>But David Icke suffered from Foucault&#39;s Pendulum type reasoning.  Umberto Eco wrote it, if you haven&#39;t read it, I think everyone on this forum would find it thoroughly entertaining.  My point is that Icke got carried away.  </p>

<p>He connected too many dots until he thought he could actually connect them all.  But he got caught in one of the Information Cults - the one dealing with Alien Geo-Political Influence and a Cosmologically Mystical Intervention.  It&#39;s not credible because SCIENCE, so yeah, you know, right there, that kind of kills it for him as a credible person.</p>

<p>And yet he plays a recurring role on this subbreddit, when there are a vast amount of more interesting sources for the basic ideas he expresses that are mercifully free of the taint of a renegade planet coming back to give me scratch ticket winnings I can use to buy my life back from the Lizard People and Jim Morrision sprung from Martian cold storage.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the point of freeing your mind if some Info-Occultist comes along slingin&#39; brainfreeze science cartoons?  It fucks with the reception on my Third Eye and gets my Pineal gland all blocked up.</p>

<p>Sorry to be the crotchety old man of <a href="/r/Conspiranauts">/r/Conspiranauts</a> but somebody has to do it.  Icke is compromised as a source.  Accept it - he did it to himself.  My profane denunciation was perhaps a bit much, but the sentiment remains, sir.</p>

<p>TL;DR:  Icke is the Lance Armstrong of sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to really argue weather or not his overall story is credible, but in his defense, I wouldn&#39;t have ever been spurred to look into the Franklin coverup if it wasn&#39;t for his ranting about pedophiles in positions of power, which I believe is a very credible position to take.</p>

<p>I understand and am familiar with some of the minor parts of the overall argument against his credibility, but much like Alex Jones I believe they are both good sources of general ideas and leads into much bigger rabbit holes, but both have a side that really shouldn&#39;t be taken as fact/seriously sometimes.</p>

<p>I was also never trying to claim him to be some end all be all persona of truth either.</p>

<p>I would like to say this though</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Einstein has some idea about religion that I don&#39;t agree with, let&#39;s not listen to him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other way around is is an equally stupid argument.  If there is one thing I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s that when someone has some really good tidbits of info that are verifiable but has some ideas that are considered &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;crazy&quot;, I usually can get the best nuggets of truth from them as long as I can catch the &quot;crazy&quot; from the stream of info.</p>
