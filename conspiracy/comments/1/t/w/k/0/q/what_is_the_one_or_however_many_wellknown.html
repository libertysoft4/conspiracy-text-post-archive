    <div class="md"><p>The idea that holograms were used to <em>simulate</em> planes hitting WTC 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>I always use this as my go-to example of dis-information.  It makes anyone discussing the irregularities in the government 911 story look like a loon by associations. Even if you had the technology, why would you risk it when it was so much simpler just to fly planes into the buildings, by whatever means.  There is NO return on this added investment.</p>

<p>In this case, Occam&#39;s Razor shaves closest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t make sense to include any other parties about the 9/11 plot. That&#39;s just more loose ends and more people who might leak the information later. Just like I&#39;m sure MI6/SAS never shared anything with the US or other nations about their involvement in Diana&#39;s death. Why bother?</p>

<p>Compartmentalization is what keeps secrets secret. Everything is on a need to know basis. People in DHS/FEMA only need to know how to respond to a <em>theoretical</em> incident. They don&#39;t need to know which of those <em>drills</em> is a planned event.</p>

<p>On such a huge event like 9/11, there&#39;s no way &#39;they&#39; could let anyone in on the full plan. I&#39;m sure each group only knew what they needed for their part of the mission. You got the guys flying the planes (hijackers, remote controlled, whatever), the guys wiring up the buildings with explosives, and the MSM wagging the dog with the &#39;official narrative&#39; and media given to them.</p>

<p>The government has a <em>lot</em> of experience with pulling off shady things.</p>

<p>So are you&#39;re saying that the conversations about how the towers went down is disingenuous and disinformation to the true conspiracy, which is who actually carried it out? Or you saying that personally you don&#39;t care how they went down, damage done, now show me who is responsible?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to come off confrontational or dismissive and if I have I apologize. I&#39;m just curious how one is able to claim Israeli involvement while simultaneously dismissing their connections to the actual demolition of the towers and building 7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the first 9/11 inside job site I ever saw was by the webfairy, Rosalee Grabel. She gained public attention with the pod planes.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv">http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv</a></p>

<p>She considered herself something of a video expert.</p>

<p>She liked to point out that the planes went into the buildings like butter. No bending parts were observed, No parts broke off as the planes hit the buildings. Butterplanes she called them and went seeking some explanation.</p>

<p>She concocted this hologram  theory and was soundly kicked out of the   9/11 community for it along with the no planes theory.</p>

<p>I  had already at that point joined her email group for a year being the only 9/11 contact I had encountered at that early date. </p>

<p>I learned a lot from  the members who  were sincerely looking for evidence and answers</p>

<p>But for the most part  It was exactly as you say, disinformation.</p>

<p>The members of the group talked a good act as the infamous no planers but if someone came up with anything  that seemed like hard damning evidence the main players in the group steered away from it or denounced it.</p>

<p>I came, I observed, I left.</p>

<p>Along the way Ms. Grable gave me web space  to store  relevant files</p>

<p>Some of them remain and I use them here occasionally.</p>

<p>Most have been deleted or degraded  by someone unknown after I lost the ability to change the files.</p>

<p>Bottom line there is no one left supporting the hologram theory.</p>

<p>Rosalee Grable was the only one who ever did as far as I know.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><em>To every problem, there is a solution that is simple, obvious... and wrong.</em></p>

<p>She looked in the wrong direction.  The <em>buildings</em> caused what she saw. It was a combination of the old &quot;broomstraw through a fencepost&quot; idea, combined with the glass curtain wall of WTC 1&amp;2 presenting no more resistance to a jetliner flying 500-600 mph than a screen door. She probably expected to see <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZjhxuhTmGk">something like this.</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I came, I observed, I left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a succinct description of my experience.</p>

<p>When 9-11 happened, I wanted to know what the hell happened.  How could the most massive intelligence apparatus in the history of the world be so completely clueless?  So I spent hours and hours reading and assimilating as much information as I could.  Nobody wanted me to come to family gatherings any more because I would try to make everyone realize the discontinuities between the official story and the evidence that was there if you just looked.  Nobody wanted to look.</p>

<p>After a while, I realized I was too involved.  I utilized Dr. John Lilly&#39;s methodology - immerse, disengage, evaluate, assimilate.  I learned to be <em>much</em> more discriminating, so it was a valuable experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an interesting theory that I heard the other day which put the two arguments together for this. Basically, the idea that it happened but not exactly in the way presented. It goes something like this:</p>

<p>The moon landing is <strong>not</strong> a hoax, meaning that we surely <strong>did</strong> land on the moon. </p>

<p><em>However</em>, two possibilities of why there is doubt:</p>

<p>1) There were technical difficulties which prevented us from getting actual footage. In order to save face, we created something to show for our efforts. Couldn&#39;t afford to be an embarrassment during the space race.</p>

<p>2) What we actually encountered was far too much for the public to handle. Whether it was UFO/ET encounters, another civilization, whatever wild thing you can imagine. The &#39;tame&#39; footage was produced to show the public something without showing them the truth.</p>

<p>Either one of these possibilities does lend credence to <em>why</em> it seems doubtful and possible discrepancies existing. It also makes sense why NASA has &quot;somehow lost all original footage of the mission.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mine is that nuclear weapons were never and could never have been dropped on japan during world war two. I had a guy here try to convince me on this one, and no matter how hard i tried to listen to him and follow his reasoning and fact check the claims, i just could not be convinced. It was an interesting idea, i admit, but it just couldnt convince me.</p>

<p>As for chemtrails, im on the fence. I know a few decades ago they were cloud seeding by shooting silver mixed with other chemicals/metals into the clouds that caused them to precipitate their moisture, and they even caused a flood in a small town that killed a number of citizens. So i dont think its too farfetched of an idea, i just feel like to attribute it to a nefarious agenda would require one to subscribe to several other theories as well. So, im on the fence til further notice.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is if there is the money for corporations like Lockheed-Martin and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to devote to the research &amp; development of spray apparatuses, nano particles and to lend financial grants to universities that employ geoengineering advocates like David Keith, then there is also probably the chump change to pay a few trolls to keep this discussion to a minimum. They would be seriously remiss in their duties if the disinformation campaign aspect of the program was not fully realized. </p>

<p>The websites most often referenced by the deniers is high school graduate Mick West&#39;s websites: contrailscience.com and metabunk.org: you have to wonder why a person would go from a computer programmer to running these disinformation websites full-time. I&#39;m sure most of the comments vehemently denying aircraft spraying are unpaid people innocently attempting to preserve a safe, sanitized worldview in their minds, but that wouldn&#39;t change the fact that there are also likely people being compensated by the very people behind the programs.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly how I feel about it. Whether or not she is or isn&#39;t a Satanist, to be consistently wearing <em>that much</em> Satanic iconography in public pictures is <em>pretty dang strange</em>.</p>

<p>Amusingly, one of the few pictures where she isn&#39;t wearing a Satanic bling necklace, she&#39;s holding up a silver platter with a golden ram statue on it. </p>

<p>When I saw it I was like &quot;Finally, a picture sans Satanic bling.&quot; and started looking down and went &quot;WTF!&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT- I assume this is the wine label. It&#39;s not as Satanic looking as I thought and could be explained away as &quot;1999.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed it is. Now I agree and didn&#39;t really notice that at the time I had seen it that it could just be &quot;1999&quot; (I was just skimming through and it caught my eye).</p>

<p>However, the &quot;9&quot; characters near the goat actually are drawn much more similarly to a &quot;6&quot; flipped over than an actual &quot;9&quot; character (notice the particularly long tail - 6 has a longer tail than a 9), and the tails also have less curve than that of a &quot;9&quot; typically does.</p>

<p>Also notably it&#39;s missing the &quot;1&quot; and most people that would say to omit the one would also omit the first nine so the goat kicked up &quot;&#39;99&quot;, which is the common abbreviation for years.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just speculation from looking at it right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, the best defense is simple disbelief. Had the commenter I mentioned not linked to these pictures, I absolutely would have dismissed it, and I&#39;m used to considering crazy theories. </p>

<p>I just found it very odd and quite amazing really that it&#39;s so blatant, like &quot;Represent! Satan bling y&#39;all!&quot; in basically every picture of her (I see some older ones without - maybe she&#39;s a convert). </p>

<p>I think as anyone who has delved into the untold history and the mysteries of our world has realized, a lot of times, reality <em>is</em> stranger than fiction, so maybe &quot;this lady is a Satanist&quot; doesn&#39;t sound so far fetched after all. </p>

<p>I mean, what other reasonable explanation is there for why she&#39;s plastering herself with Satanist iconography? I don&#39;t have one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many popular conspiracies that should not be taken seriously. The one that bugs me the most is the crazy belief that the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were brought down by planted explosives. This one will not go away, in spite of its absurdity. Every time I mention this, I get down voted. I don&#39;t care. This conspiracy theory is wrong. It flies in the face of common sense. It&#39;s downright silly, and I won&#39;t pretend that it has any plausibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing absurd about it. WTC7 could not have collapsed the way it did unless all of the main vertical supports failed simultaneously. To suggest it collapsed because of a fire flies in the face of history, because no steel frame skyscraper has ever collapsed from fire even when it&#39;s burning from ground to top. If the structural damage from being hit by a plane engine caused a weak spot which led to the collapse, then the building would have fallen in that direction and not vertically inside its own footprint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC 7 did have some exterior structural damage due to falling debris, but you&#39;re absolutely right about the collapse. The only way it falls the way it did is if <em>all of the load bearing members disappear simultaneously.</em> Fire can&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>Why do you think explosives so impossible? What exactly &quot;flies in the face of common sense&quot;?  What common sense are you referring to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think explosives is a less plausible hypothesis than the NIST explanation that Towers 1,2 and 7 collapsed into their own footprints due to fires?</p>

<p>The thing is, there are many thousands of attested examples of explosives causing steel and concrete buildings to collapse into their own footprints. </p>

<p>Unless you know of some examples of fires doing the same thing, then it&#39;s the official explanation which is low on plausibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s pretty incredible to think that either the U.S. sent someone to the moon or the U.S. faked it... either way it&#39;s quite a feat and the fact that there&#39;s some uncertainty is even more incredible</p>

<p>it&#39;s also worth noting that one of the moon landings could have been faked but that doesn&#39;t mean nobody has ever been to the moon before</p>
