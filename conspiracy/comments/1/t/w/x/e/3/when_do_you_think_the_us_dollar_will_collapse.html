    <div class="md"><p>Its hard to say, although the US dollar is a debt based system it is still backed by 2 things.  OIL and the US Military.  As long as the OPEC countries agree to sell oil in federal US notes and the dollar remains the worlds currency then congress can keep writing hot cheques that the world has to pay for.   They will keep bailing out the big banks and they will keep pumping funny money into the economy.  Remember Moammar Gadhafis hasty fall from grace?  Well he wanted to get all of Africa&#39;s oil sales to reject the dollar and put it on a gold standard and that&#39;s why the west wanted him dead so bad any other reason like the poor people of Libya is simply a flat out lie, it was about OIL and nothing else.  So as long as the USA has the military might to keep the OPEC countries in line and the US Federal dollar as the worlds currency then you&#39;re unlikely to see hyper inflation ie: Zimbabwe or a crash.  Lets keep in mind though that the whole system is a house of cards that relies solely on the geopolitical variables holding the dollar up, in particular the petrodollar.  That&#39;s why the US government has to keep tight control over the world and its own people, that&#39;s why it&#39;s passing totalitarian laws like the NDAA it knows that its whole operation is a sham and the slightest breeze of dissent can set a crash into motion the likes the world has never seen since the fall of Rome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good analysis. However, I might add that the coming crash of the dollar will most likely be far worse than the Fall of Rome, because the rest of the world was far less affected than it would be by the fall of the American Empire.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is exactly why the USD won&#39;t crash. </p>

<p>The world will not let it crash. <strong>It can&#39;t let it crash.</strong> It&#39;d be economic suicide for every major nation involved, literally causing the pillars of the global economy <em>(The United States, the European Union &amp; China)</em> to come crashing down. </p>

<p>The American Hegemony will fade, not fall violently, in my opinion. And this will happen around 2030 I think, after the Shale Oil boom dries up, China surpasses us economically and our OPEC buddies are way past peak oil. </p>

<p>And it will happen, once again in my opinion, with the USD being replaced by the Chinese Yuan as the world&#39;s Reserve Currency. I also believe this will be a peaceful transition, albeit with some turbulence such a global recession, but the same happened in the 70s <em>(IIRC)</em> with the transition of the world&#39;s Reserve Currency from the Pound-to-the-USD, and we survived that. </p>

<p>There is no benefit, for us or other countries, to let the USD collapse. Even after it&#39;s replaced as the world&#39;s Reserve Currency, America will still have incredible influence through-out the world and still remain a major Great Power. To throw that away would be illogical, and quite simply, retarded. It will also ruin the chances of any other potential Great Powers <em>(I.E. China, Brazil &amp; the European Union)</em> from rising to the aforementioned status. The only nations that would gain, in my opinion, would be India &amp; Russia, and even then they would take MASSIVE hits economically from such a collapse, endangering them stability-wise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The United States doesn&#39;t push oil on the world. The world pushes oil on itself. It has a unquenchable thirst, and it&#39;s not just the United States fault, but at the same time it is the United States&#39; fault, just in a collective sense in relation the rest of the world. </p>

<p>The petrodollar wasn&#39;t created by the United States. The petrodollar was created by the global economy, and it&#39;s security insured by the United States. The USD is backed by not only the United States military, but the United States&#39; strategic position <em>(two oceans on both sides, two friendly nations on top &amp; bottom)</em>, large economy and relative stability. Because the fact of the matter is, <strong>the world won&#39;t let the dollar collapse. They can&#39;t.</strong></p>

<p>What&#39;s going to happen, I think, is a peaceful transition to the Chinese Yuan, in my opinion, around 2030. To quote my other post in this thread which elaborates furthur on this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think it will crash.</p>

<p>But to answer the question in the sense of when I think it would be most susceptible to crash?</p>

<p><strong>2030</strong></p>

<p>I say this because this is around the time that the Chinese economy will surpass the United States, the Shale Boom will have exhausted itself and our OPEC allies will be a good little way past peak oil (R.I.P. Petrodollar). China has already started trading their oil in their own currency and stopped buying U.S. debt, so their clearly preparing for it, and wisely at that. The European Union has also cut out the USD from currency transactions with China or something like that, so they&#39;re preparing as well.</p>

<p>While the crash of the USD is possible, I&#39;m MUCH MORE concerned (since it&#39;s the most probable outcome) about us loosing our Reserve Currency status (and sadly it&#39;s looking inevitable). The last time this happened, with the transition from the Pound to the Dollar, the global economy was sent into a recession. This will be no different. And if we crash completely, than we&#39;re looking at a global depression, the likes of which have been unseen since the 1920s.</p>

<p>The real question though, is who will replace us as the world&#39;s Reserve Currency? The only two viable options at the moment are the Euro and Chinese Yuan. And honestly, we&#39;re (the United States) are going to surpass the E.U.&#39;s economy by 2020, not to mention Europe itself has a aging population. So, really my bet is on China. But who knows; it&#39;ll be a multi-polar world by then. There will be no super power by 2030, just great powers: the United States, the European Union, China and Russia (with Brazil &amp; India coming up the rear).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this time however, I believe, or at least hope, we can get our debt in order. We were able to do it Post-WWII, and if anybody&#39;s been paying attention, <strong>we have</strong> been getting our deficit spending down to a manageable degree. The Shale Boom, while environmentally fucked-up because of fracking, should keep us going at least until 2030, at which point, I believe, we&#39;ll pass the torch to China. </p>

<p>And at that point the world will be so different I hate to predict. It&#39;ll be a whole different landscape, a multi-polar world with no singular or two competing super powers. Probably one centered around Asia, hence why some have started to call the new century the <em>&quot;Asian Century&quot;</em>. The great powers of the future, in my opinion, will be the United States, China &amp; European Union <em>(with Brazil &amp; India coming up from behind)</em>. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s my dilemma: <strong>We can do that WITHOUT nanny state bullshit or authoritarian shit like the NDAA.</strong> There&#39;s no need for it. We can secure our realpolitick interests without resorting to becoming a police state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but that was different. </p>

<p>The transition of the world&#39;s Reserve Currency from the Pound to the USD caused a global recession. But it was a peaceful, and relatively stable, transition. </p>

<p>What people are discussing in this thread are the <em>imminent</em> collapse of the USD. This would cause a global depression the likes of which have been unseen since the 1920s. And the shitty part is, no other country is capable of replacing us <em>at the moment</em>. </p>

<p>Which is why I think it won&#39;t happen. The world won&#39;t let us. They CAN&#39;T let us. It&#39;d be suicide. </p>

<p>I honestly think the USD won&#39;t collapse, but the world&#39;s Reserve Currency will simply transition from the USD to the Chinese Yuan around <em>(my armchair prediction)</em> 2030. And I predict, that as with the Pound-to-the-USD transition, this will cause a global recession, but not a depression. </p>

<p>You are right though, the military industrial complex has become our new business, on borrowed money. However, are you forgetting which event started the war drums?</p>

<p>A 10 year conflict that&#39;s longer than any previous war we&#39;ve been involved in. A conflict that began shortly after one event in particular, right after 2001. How much more obvious do you need it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s like saying Pearl Harbor was planned. </p>

<p>Known about in advance, possibly, intelligence reports predicting it, definitely, but not orchestrated and planned intimately. </p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that 9/11 happened exactly as it looked like it happened. The only difference being that Cheney and Bush knew about it, knew it was going to happen and let it happen anyway. </p>

<p>I mean, the motives to attack the United States are out there. You don&#39;t have to go very god damn far to see some of the wrongs we&#39;ve committed or the people we&#39;ve fucked. </p>

<p>Why would you possibly risk doing it yourself when you can just leave the front door unlocked and have your enemy do it for you? Kill two birds with one stone. Least risk, most gain, clean as can be. At least...you know...that&#39;s how I would do it. ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a <a href="http://www.silverseek.com/commentary/deceptions-dupes-dots-12799">very interesting article</a> that analyses how this could play out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The year 2014 will see important changes to global trade, in a major Paradigm Shift. The movement of gold eastward confirms it. The USGovt shutdown (debt default) confirms it. The indirect audits of warehouses by the Eastern powers confirm it. The hostility between the United States and Saudi Arabia confirms it. The rise of the Nat Gas Coop confirms it. The new Shanghai crude oil futures contract in Yuan denomination confirms it. The shift of military power in the entire Middle East confirms it. The year 2014 will be tumultuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question I&#39;d love to get an answer back from one of you on: 
WILL the dollar crash? Could the government put off a crash by involving us in a WWIII-type situation? Historically, war has been seen as a catapult, so to speak, for economies (on the winning side). I know the dollar won&#39;t be stopped from crashing through a war alone, but maybe they could put off the <em>coming</em> crash. And maybe they could switch to a more favorable currency without a crash of epic proportions. 
Any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When interest rates rise in the US, two things will happen. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The US gov will not be able to pay the interest on trillions of dollars in debt. As a result the Fed will begin printing money to pay it off, causing massive inflation.</p></li>
<li><p>The banks will move all of their assets (which they got from all that QE) from the Fed bank (who has been paying the banks interest to keep it there instead of lending it out) and start releasing it into the economy, again causing massive inflation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So there you have it. Once you hear that interest rates are rising, beat the rush and go stock up on food and water. Exactly when this will happen I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Our good old friend Mr. Schiff explains it all really well here. Gave me chills the first time I heard it (Sorry, 2 hour lecture but its really good!):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you juxtapose the chain of events happening here i.e. austerity measures/cuts in foodstamps and unemployment benefits with what&#39;s happening in China i.e. yuan growing in strength surpassing the euro and the government allowing people to have more than one kid if feels like the change will happen relatively soon.  Maybe in 2014, but most likely in 2017 just as the new president gets a bit situated, but not too situated so that people can lay the blame completely on the new president.  </p>

<p>9/11 happened about 10 months into Bush&#39;s presidency and the bank bailout happened few months into Obama&#39;s presidency.  These things have a way of happening so that blame isn&#39;t placed on the former or current president.   </p>

<p>The thing is, the market may force the issue so that it happens sooner rather than later.  Although markets are currently completely manipulated it does seem as though there is an effort being made to investigate these scandals and maybe, just maybe, some of this corruption will be punished. When that happens the whole house of cards may come falling down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think it will crash. </p>

<p>But to answer the question in the sense of when I think it would be most <em>susceptible</em> to crash? </p>

<p><strong>2030</strong></p>

<p>I say this because this is around the time that the Chinese economy will surpass the United States, the Shale Boom will have exhausted itself and our OPEC allies will be a good little way past peak oil <em>(R.I.P. Petrodollar)</em>. China has already started trading their oil in their own currency and stopped buying U.S. debt, so their clearly preparing for it, and wisely at that. The European Union has also cut out the USD from currency transactions with China or something like that, so they&#39;re preparing as well.</p>

<p>While the crash of the USD is possible, I&#39;m MUCH MORE concerned <em>(since it&#39;s the most probable outcome)</em> about us loosing our Reserve Currency status <em>(and sadly it&#39;s looking inevitable)</em>. The last time this happened, with the transition from the Pound to the Dollar, the global economy was sent into a recession. This will be no different. And if we crash completely, than we&#39;re looking at a global depression, the likes of which have been unseen since the 1920s.</p>

<p>The real question though, is who will replace us as the world&#39;s Reserve Currency? The only two viable options at the moment are the Euro and Chinese Yuan. And honestly, we&#39;re <em>(the United States)</em> are going to surpass the E.U.&#39;s economy by 2020, not to mention Europe itself has a aging population. So, really my bet is on China. But who knows; it&#39;ll be a multi-polar world by then. There will be no super power by 2030, just great powers: the United States, the European Union, China and Russia <em>(with Brazil &amp; India coming up the rear)</em>. </p>
