        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Firstly, with the &#39;squibs are clear proof of explosives on the WTD buildings&#39; theory...</p>

<p>ELI5 how this isn&#39;t just air being compressed out of a window or a wall having a whole blown through from the massive amount of pressure from the floors all pancaking down on themselves so fast</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in arguments from both sides.  I would love a list of ELI5&#39;s on all the theories... </p>

<p>Would love to know how the central columns aren&#39;t left pointing out if the pancake theory is true </p>

<p>also why the buildings didn&#39;t start to topple to one side when they fell and instead fell almost vertically down... Maybe the weight of it them?</p>

<p>I know loose change was supposedly debunked but I&#39;ve not really seen any debunking of conspiracy theories as good as the conspiracy theories themselves.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the official reason given for not releasing any of the other recordings of the pentagon attack? Has that been addressed yet why there is still no better footage?</p>

<p>Is the official line that the plane actually evaporated for the most part?</p>

<p>Some bbc show made me laugh when they used a pile of flour with a pebble being dropped onto it to explain how there was no wreckage for the plane that went down on route to a target... The pebble disappeared into the flour as proof (?!)</p>

<p>Been out the loop on this for a while but would have thought some better explanations would have been given by now.</p>

<p>What are some of the conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 at first that have now been debunked?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to answer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Squibs appear many many floors below before it collapses. Also hunks of metal were ejected out of the building, levels below, jetting out all over the area. Huge metal beams were belted out of the towers.</p></li>
<li><p>Pop mechancs said the buildings pancaked, but NIST said they didn&#39;t. Go figure. Clearly there is some debate there, even among debunkers.</p></li>
<li><p>The building shouldn&#39;t have fell. It should have had the fire burn out and then stayed there.</p></li>
<li><p>Loose change isn&#39;t great, but it was good for its time. I would watch &quot;9/11 a new pearl harbor&quot;. It came out recently and it&#39;s great.</p></li>
<li><p>Pentagon I don&#39;t know enough about. For all I know it was a plane, or a missile. Sorry</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would reccomend watching a new pearl harbor. It&#39;s for free online and it&#39;s 5 hours, but entertaining and well researched and will answer almost all your questions. Good luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official conspiracy theory says that flight 93 dove straight down from a high altitude and was buried.</p>

<p>Here are the quotes from the eye witnesses that observed flight 93 just before it crashed. Is there any logic to the official story?</p>

<p>Tim Thornsberg, working in a nearby strip mine: “It came in low over the trees and started wobbling. Then it just rolled over and was flying upside down for a few seconds… and then it kind of stalled and did a nose dive over the trees.” [WPXI 11 (PITTSBURGH), 9/13/2001]</p>

<p>Terry Butler, at Stoystown: He sees the plane come out of the clouds, low to the ground. “It was moving like you wouldn’t believe. Next thing I knew it makes a heck of a sharp, right-hand turn.” It banks to the right and appears to be trying to climb to clear one of the ridges, but it continues to turn to the right and then veers behind a ridge. About a second later it crashes. [ST. PETERSBURG TIMES, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>Charles Sturtz, a half-mile from the crash site: The plane is heading southeast and has its engines running. No smoke can be seen. “It was really roaring, you know. Like it was trying to go someplace, I guess.” [WPXI 11 (PITTSBURGH), 9/13/2001]</p>

<p>Rob Kimmel, several miles from the crash site: He sees it fly overhead, banking hard to the right. It is 200 feet or less off the ground as it crests a hill to the southeast. “I saw the top of the plane, not the bottom.” [LONGMAN, 2002, PP. 210-211]</p>

<p>Eric Peterson of Lambertsville: He sees a plane flying overhead unusually low. The plane seemed to be turning end-over-end as it dropped out of sight behind a tree line. [PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>Bob Blair of Stoystown: He sees the plane spiraling and flying upside down, not much higher than the treetops, before crashing. [DAILY AMERICAN, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>An unnamed witness says he hears two loud bangs before watching the plane take a downward turn of nearly 90 degrees. [NEWS CHANNEL 5 (CLEVELAND), 9/11/2001]</p>

<p>Terry Butler, a few miles north of Lambertsville: “It dropped out of the clouds.” The plane rose slightly, trying to gain altitude, then “it just went flip to the right and then straight down.” [PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>Lee Purbaugh, 300 yards away: “There was an incredibly loud rumbling sound and there it was, right there, right above my head—maybe 50 feet up.… I saw it rock from side to side then, suddenly, it dipped and dived, nose first, with a huge explosion, into the ground. I knew immediately that no one could possibly have survived.” [INDEPENDENT, 8/13/2002]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your points.</p>

<p>Squibs.</p>

<p>You need the pancake theory to call them compressed air and  the fact is that no pancakes ever formed .</p>

<p>The debris was the result of explosive s turning the debris into shrapnel. There were no pancake layers on the ground so there was no pancake collapse.</p>

<p>The central columns were left sticking out anyway in the north tower collapse. The spire as it was known anomalously turned to dust soon afterward floating downward instead of falling over.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goGGQhhTcDY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goGGQhhTcDY</a></p>

<p>The south tower did tilt at  first but it then changed course in mid air, defying conservation of momentum, and fell instead in the direction of most resistance, defying physics once again unless it was the result of a professional demolition.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Kwb8A">http://imgur.com/Kwb8A</a></p>

<p>The Pentagon video&#39;s were withheld pending the Moussoui trial. The  little  bit of video that  was released after the trial was completely free of relevant content.</p>

<p>The Pentagon plane disappeared completely within a second of hitting the Pentagon wall. you know like a missile always does but an airliner never does.</p>

<p>Note, this picture is so soon after the collision that the flames have yet to become flame shaped.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/0.1%20%20WHICH%20DISAPPEARS%20Instantly%20Boeing%20or%20Missile.jpg%201.jpg">http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/0.1%20%20WHICH%20DISAPPEARS%20Instantly%20Boeing%20or%20Missile.jpg%201.jpg</a></p>

<p>and yes they say that all of those tons of metal disappeared instantly.</p>

<p>You seem to be referring to the Pennsylvania flight 93 next.</p>

<p>That plane was shot down by order of Dick Cheney. Here he will tell you so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5GgZa9V0A8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5GgZa9V0A8</a></p>

<p>Here is the resulting debris pile from that crash according to the story.</p>

<p>Be sure to read the quote by the coroner at the scene.</p>

<p><a href="http://killtown.911review.org/htb2.html">http://killtown.911review.org/htb2.html</a></p>

<p>There is massive evidence for conspiracy with names named and connections pinpointed </p>

<p>There is so much that it can never be addressed at one sitting.</p>

<p>There is no possibility that the official story is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FEMA did an analysis of some of the steel from building 7:</p>

<p>A) <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf</a></p>

<p>Look at the photos of the sample in that pdf especially the first and second photos.</p>

<p>Then look at the experiment that the guy did in this video @10 minutes 35 seconds.</p>

<p>B) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNOM_U5UM6Q#t=10m34s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNOM_U5UM6Q#t=10m34s</a></p>

<p>The FEMA sample (A) and the steel cut by thermite in the video (B) look almost identical.</p>

<p>The FEMA PHD&#39;s in material science could not figure out what caused the melting in (A). They did not analyse for explosives of accelerants. They asked that there be further study to determine what caused the melting. Take a wild guess if there was further study done.</p>

<p>Also look at the color of the smoke in the video and then look at the color of the smoke that blasts out of the windows ahead of the crashing towers. The color is identical.</p>

<p>Having an &#39;of course it was a conspiracy!&#39; attitude towards any question asked about 911 and ignoring what was actually asked is no different than the people saying &#39;of course it wasn&#39;t a conspiracy theory!&#39; when questions are asked.</p>

<p>No offence, but that is a little bit of an ignorant response you gave there and similar to why most people wont give the time of day to anything against the official story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten to the point where if there is one hole in the official story like 9/11 building #7, I stop questioning whether it a conspiracy and start looking at the reason why it was meant to be done, and who profited off of it.  I got held up on 9/11 for too long trying to prove this(thermite) or that (judy woods energy weapon) happened.  If the official story is laughable its obviously a cover up so next and most important step is why did it happen.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DR JUDY WOOD.... some interesting theories from her...</p>

<p>did you know that the WTC towers had over 50,000(approx between both towers) toilets none of which were found in tact. The same with all the computer equipment.. The largest thing they found was a piece of a keyboard. What about the cars on fire over a half mile away? some cars turned over on their sides? There is a lot more to this then we will EVER be told.. In Judy wood&#39;s opinion when the windows are blowing out, it is due to water pressure built up and shooting out the windows as the building was brought down. </p>

<p>How about the other stuff? Was there ever a reason as to why we still haven&#39;t seen the other footage of the plane hitting the pentagon? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DEWs are the 800lb gorilla in the room. There&#39;s a lot of evidence that the Aum Shinrikyo cult acquired Tesla Weapons Technology through Russian contacts, tested it in Australia, and possibly deployed it in Japan. This was the subject of a US Senate investigation and the story is fascinating. </p>

<p>It&#39;s likely what Defense Secretary Cohen was referencing when he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby <strong>they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.</strong></p>

<p>Aum Shinrikyo to this day still surprises me.</p>
