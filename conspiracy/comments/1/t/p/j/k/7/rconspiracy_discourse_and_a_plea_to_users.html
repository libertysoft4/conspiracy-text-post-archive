        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As this sub is my favorite on reddit,  I thought I&#39;d just like to make a simple suggestion that I feel,  if taken to heart,  may elevate the standard and perceived quality of our group. With all the trolls we get around here, it&#39;s really easy to lower ourselves to their level and trade insults and get into pissing matches. One sure way to identify a troll is that they just resort to name calling and admit hominim attacks instead of using logic or facts to back up an opposite or differing opinion. The true points and quality info tend to get buried in irrational arguments and mud slinging. Im really sick of the typical internet bullshit, pissy, reactionary responses to topics that I feel are important. </p>

<p>With so many people out there wanting to believe we are irrational and uninformed,  or even mentally ill,  I think it should be our mission to keep a level head and civil dialogue amongst eachother. The trolls will stand out by being the childish mockers with nothing of any substance to add to the discussion,  and less able to dilute the message with the noise. We, as the legitimate users here,  should be able to challenge eachother in order to get to the truth,  and the only way to do that is with respect. The trolls won&#39;t do that, and therefore should be ignored, not fed. If I challenge a conspiracy theory or any one of its meta points, I promise to do it respectfully. Even if the OP is poisoning the well with a fake conspiracy to make us look bad. They will expose themselves by coming back at you with an unreasonable attack, at which point it should indicate we are dealing with a shill or troll. But calling people shills is counterproductive. Just ignore a shill when possible, or continue to use rationality and civility. Honest people will be able to see that the people here trying to get the truth out are not paranoid,  unreasonable idiots. There are lots of people here with extremely good information that needs to get out. There are also lots of people trying to derail that. Fighting on their level is not working. </p>

<p>We need to be critical and skeptical of our own confirmation biases,  and weed out the fake from the real amongst ourselves, and we can&#39;t do that by turning our debates into pissing matches. I pledge to not lower myself to the level the users at r/conspiratard operate on, and if we,  the true seekers of truth, do the same,  I believe we can improve the quality of information here greatly. I&#39;m interested to hear what others think of this plan. I expect to get some comments designed to irritate me and drag me into a fight of some kind. Perhaps some name calling... let&#39;s see... to me they will be obvious as to what their intent in replying is. Thanks for listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make it sound like people here don&#39;t actually do that. Many of us do.</p>

<p>However, when we have the same trolls coming back day after day for weeks and months on end with the same disinformation, even after getting shown evidence to the contrary, then it becomes too much to ask not to treat them with disrespect. They just never quit. I for one have been going through this for years and years and am to the point where I just either downvote and move on or, much less frequently call them out immediately. I also like to respond with a simple link to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/05/twenty-five-rules-of-disinformation.html">The 25 Rules of Disinformation</a> pointing out which they have violated. <a href="http://pastebin.com/irj4Fyd5">The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide To Forum Spies</a> is also useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW I was recently labelled a &quot;piece of shit shill&quot; for holding (and expressing) differing opinions here - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1si3xy/remember_this_back_from_08_nobody_really_believed/cdy60tk">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1si3xy/remember_this_back_from_08_nobody_really_believed/cdy60tk</a></p>

<p>Perhaps I have a biased perspective, but it often seems to be that some of the conspiracy theorists here are the first to jump to insulting and personal attacks when confronted by opposing viewpoints (whether they&#39;re perceived as &quot;trolls&quot; or not).</p>

<p>Trolls be trollin&#39; but not all those who disagree are trolls (and I suspect few, if any, are paid shills) but there is a tendency among some here to leap to that conclusion, often quite aggressively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>This is a reply I wrote to a comment that replied to mine but was deleted before I could post - it made mention of the term &quot;conspiratard&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;conspiratard&quot; name is probably somewhat unfortunate in some ways, it means that whole sub seems to constitute an attack on conspiracy theorists, which it isn&#39;t really. (Disclosure: My other account is subscribed there, but this one isn&#39;t, as being a &quot;member of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>&quot; was cited as part of the reason I was banned previously). </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s worth noting that many (most?) of the people who seem to post in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are not the trolls and shills they get labelled as here. Instead I think many are people who enjoy, to some extent, debating these ideas here and elsewhere. That sub then is somewhere to &quot;blow off steam&quot; - talk to people who are probably of a similar persuasion and share &quot;war stories&quot;</p>

<p>Most of the people I know of from there who contribute here do so respectfully and with patience. But obviously we&#39;re unlikely to convince anyone - it&#39;s like debating religion.</p>

<p>One thing I think is lacking (with some) here is an <em>assumption of good faith</em>. Most of us who come here to offer opposing viewpoints are doing so with good faith - we&#39;re not paid to do so, we&#39;re not trying to cause trouble, we just genuinely like to try to present some alternative viewpoints. Some seem unable to comprehend that good faith and seem to see any opposition as an attack. </p>

<p>I think the thing that would help the most here is an encouragement to assume good faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound reasonable and good natured. I may even have another look over there keeping that in mind.
Sadly the picture you describe is not what I&#39;ve seen. I find it much more akin to R/atheism.</p>

<p>As for not convincing anyone, and like debating religion. I&#39;m not sure you are correct there. Conspiracy theories are not integral to my world view, and I disbelieve a lot of the theories presented here. I actually find the folks at conspiratard far more emotionally invested in their view of the world, and therefore defensive at any ideas that challenge their construct of what the world is.</p>

<p>Couple that with the general consensus confirming their view of the world, and you get people who can be extremely fixed and rigidly tied to their own ideas, and close minded to possible alternatives.</p>

We can say they are all trolls and shills, and I&#39;m willing to suspend that belief for the purpose of allowing civil discourse.

    <div class="md"><p>It would be great if we could get the moderates from both subs to debate some agreed upon subjects. The rules would be rigorous, not allowing for name calling, personal attacks, and the like. I tried to have a discussion on r/conspiratard once and couldn&#39;t find one non-hostile reply.

    <div class="md"><p>Those are excellent links. Thanks for that. I hear your frustration over being bombarded by asshats but I think your first solution of simply ignoring them after a swift down vote serves you better than the fruitless task of calling them a shill or troll. You can&#39;t actually prove the accusations so it just degrades into a circular argument. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t intend to suggest there weren&#39;t any users who don&#39;t follow the general code of conduct I am describing. I reread my post looking for anything to give that impression but maybe I missed something. In fact, to make the claim that I am making that statement is treading dangerously on rule number four of the list of disinformation tactics you linked to:</p>

<p>&quot; 4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say you are deliberately using this to derail my post like a troll or shill would, but in essence you are illustrating my main point; We need to avoid using these exact tactics against eachother when discussing issues. I&#39;m saving your links and you have my upvote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Being accused of something you&#39;re not drags out the worst in a person. I&#39;ve recently dealt with being called out, not as a shill,  but a tard,  while trying to discuss something on r/conspiratard just because I tried to ask a question of those users&#39; beliefs. It works both ways exactly the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much as I assume many of the posters here dislike the shill-hunting here, I think most on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> dislike seeing hostility to conspiracy theorists who choose to post there.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in another comment, I think the best thing that can be done to help in these contentious discussions is to <em>assume good faith</em> - that means people here should assume, ideally, that people who are raising opposing viewpoints here are doing so for genuine reasons, rather than because they are trolls or shills.</p>

<p>Similarly I&#39;d hope that those on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> would assume that anyone posting there in favor of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; is doing so because they&#39;re genuinely interested in hearing differing opinions.</p>

<p>Assuming good faith in others makes internet forums much nicer places, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to comment on the purpose of r/conspiratard right quick...</p>

<p>I made a post on their sub a few weeks back. I was expecting to be oustted and ridiculed, but i was met with great respect. They willfully explained to me that their sub is in fact there to ridicule the users of r/conspiracy. BUT only when they feel the users here are bat shit crazy. Their ridiculing posts on their sub is usually done in jest. At least, that is how they explained it to me.</p>

<p>When i asked for legit discussion on topics, and assured my purpose was to get opinions of the other dide of the aisle, i was again met with great respect. We discussed some topics, tossing ideas here and there, but we tended to agree to disagree. It was cordial. Nice. </p>

<p>For once, i was able to discuss theoriez without being called a shill, or even a conspiratard. The majority of users there used to be users here but were cast out for not believing in everything. Their skepticism to theories led them to create another sub to vent their frustrations through satire. </p>

<p>I was pleased to find out that many believe in some conspiracy theories, just not all conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>While there are bad apples anywhere on reddit, there are also good ones everywhere, including r/conspiratard.</p>

<p>They do tend to share our passion for truth.</p>

<p>And like you said, we ALL must maintain a certain level of civility when it comes to discussion, amd we must reserve our beliefs from our speculations. Bottom line: respect goes far further than insults.</p>

<p>Im not too sure if this helped or if it was relevant, but i thought id speak my piece. Happy holidays btw!</p>

I&#39;m resolving to treat others with respect no matter how immature their behavior, or else just ignore them.

I don&#39;t think he represents the majority of users on conspiracy though at all,  as I feel most people here are able to rise above that. It&#39;s his attitude that serves to divide rather than unite. He can only preach to the choir and will never convince anyone of his truth if the are starting from a different perspective. </p>

<p>I have been here quite a while and have never been banned. Even arguing on here while drunk occasionally.</p>

<p>I remember the last wave when confidence in r/conspiracy was getting bad. Wow you talk about a conspiracy. Everyone got pissed and started making new subreddits and unsubscribing. I even made a fuck you I&#39;m out post (and didn&#39;t get banned). I think the mods were being blamed for too many shills after the shootings. The r/conspiratard anti-semitic conspiracy got brought up. A couple people were really leading the charge...</p>

<p>I sure do feel deja vu. Makes you wonder if they are choreographed incidences to create division in the truth seeking community.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that our collective force is what keeps r/conspiracy free from the thought police.</p>

<p>With division they will acquire a foothold. If disinfo doesn&#39;t get debunked and the thought police aren&#39;t outnumbered and quelled, then they will slowly gain control of the group think of r/conspiracy and turn it into crap.</p>

<p>With that being said, I barely know about this new situation and don&#39;t really care</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. If we don&#39;t sort out the disinformation amongst ourselves,  then the bastards win. Conspiracy theories are often comprised of extraordinary claims and need extraordinary proofs and clarity if they ever have a hope of being broadly adopted as the truth so that burden is on the one making the claim. When I read compelling arguments on issues that may seem incredible, I try to seek out the most credible argument against those claims.

<p>Think of it in terms of 9/11. It is not just attempting to crush alternative viewpoints. It is attempting to stop the discussion of the actual existing facts. Like the official story should be taken as the word of god and no discussion of the facts should happen. They don&#39;t want you to think for yourself, they will tell you what to think...thought police.</p>

<p>&quot;Caveat lector</p>

<p>The danger, of course, is that not everyone with a concern is a concern troll - and not every concern is unreasonable. In environments of genuine groupthink, applying the concern troll label may serve as a means of enforcing conformity and punishing (or silencing) dissent. And even without actual groupthink in play, many Internet posters find dismissing an argument much quicker and easier than evaluating it. In addition, the term &quot;concern troll&quot; focuses not on what the person is actually saying, but on some alleged agenda. Thus, if misused, it is the perfect refuge for someone who has no counter to the actual argument: simply ignore the points made, allege some other position, and then accuse the other person of lying if they deny that that is what they&#39;re really saying. It&#39;s a combination of straw man and argumentum ad hominem: make up something to attack, and ignore their actual points on the basis that since the points were made by someone acting in bad faith, they need not be addressed.
Sometimes outsiders will come by and make concern troll-like statements sincerely. Some are sincere but stupid. Some may be insightful, and justified iconoclasts, merely making valid observations unwelcome to the dominant ideology or culture of the forum (the Cassandra syndrome[5]). Often, of course, the person is misguided, wrong, and not actually trolling.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then it&#39;s clear you have built a straw man argument, which is the kind of logical fallacy I see being used against this sub a lot. You are illustrating my point,  which was that we should rise above baseless accusations amongst ourselves and others with opposing views. Your unfounded accusation, which you admit is based on pure bias on your part, serves only to preclude my message. The fact that you are fine with believing things based entirely on your own confirmation bias tells me you are not a very critical thinker,  which is what this sub is accused of being stocked with. I believe there are far more rational thinking people on this sub and you do not represent them at all. Using troll tactics, as you are here,  to attempt to kill the messenger is not useful to this discussion, other than to show what could be improved here, IMO. If you are serious about enlightening others to the truth, you should study logical fallacies and then avoid them in your own posts. </p>

<p>So, you stated you were quite aware of your own link but denied using it to try and silence debate.  Also denying the straw man, which is clearly the case according to your own link. What part of this is hard for you to understand? Now you threaten to use the same faulty logic to follow me around on here to silence anything I might say in the future. I just feel your means of discourse are weak an unproductive for this sub, and debate in general. </p>

<p>The 2013 NDAA revision didn&#39;t overturn a 40 year ban on using propaganda against american citizens for nothing.</p>

<p>And there are a couple interest groups who openly admit to paying people to influence public opinion of forums.</p>
