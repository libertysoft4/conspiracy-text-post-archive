<blockquote>
<p>The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Science.</strong> The group&#39;s doctrine or ideology is considered to be the ultimate Truth, beyond all questioning or dispute. Truth is not to be found outside the group. The leader, as the spokesperson for God or for all humanity, is likewise above criticism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a sort of forced orthodoxy on this sub which stems from a reflexive denial of the merit of any opposing viewpoint. Much like in societies like China or North Korea where any ideologies save for the ones espoused by the powers that be are violently suppressed. </p>

<p>For all of the circlejerking to the contrary in this sub, we don&#39;t live in the sort of Orwellian nightmare state in which this sort of phenomena manifests.</p>

<p>It was a joke dude. If you really are that feeble minded that I stopped all thought in your brain with one sarcastic comment I pity you.</p>

<p>Then how would the members know they were supposed to do it? Telepathy?</p>

<p>Also, apart from the fact that people like me could just come here and spill the beans and get a top story / plentiful kudos until they remembered I was mainly a sceptic, and then they&#39;d bay for my blood and tell me I had to step down as mod. ;-)</p>

<p>You guys should go over there more often. See what it&#39;s all about. Looking at the front page of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> right now, practically the only content do to with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is to do with the ridiculous witch hunt some guys have churned up.</p>

<p>The rest is links from imgur / facebook / youtube, etc. So really, when I hear about how <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> wants to &quot;destroy <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; it holds about much water as a bucket with a hole in it. They could drop every reference to you guys, and lose what, 10 - 15% of their content.</p>

<p>Nobody here is trying to brigade conspiratard.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;re doing exactly what you accuse others of, and since you claim that is brigading... then that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re doing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody here really gives a shit about what is upvoted and downvoted over there because we aren&#39;t obsessed with their conversations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ditto for r/conspiratard... except you personally are very obsessed with their conversations. (and you keep on trying to brigade them... I mean, that <em>is</em> what posting a link to another sub is, right?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We simply want them to stay over there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Aside from the usual people from both sides acting like dicks, why do you want any dissenting opinions excluded? Is this just your wish, or do you speak for the whole sub? (and if you do, this sub really does not respect other views and opinions...)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I beg you, please try to message the mods and get them to ban me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remind me to not try using any kind of sarcasm of humour with you... they wouldn&#39;t ban you because brigading of any kind is not mentioned in the sub rules here so what you are doing is perfectly fine by the mods.</p>

<p>Funny that... the sub that complains about it is fine with it, the sub constantly accused of it is the one with the rules/regs against it. (and you still have not provided any evidence at all for a brigade going on... and downvotes don&#39;t work for that, unless this subreddit is a singular hivemind that never disagrees with itself.)</p>

<p>&quot;my way of fighting back against the brigades of <strong>trolls and shills</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RES tagging assists me to upvote or downvote more swiftly, because I can zone in concentration &amp; analyze who is who quicker.</p>

<p>I RES tag trolls and shills to flag them, so as to downvote or ignore them, depending on the severity included in descriptions assisted by the colors of my tags. </p>

<p>If I tag a redditor, I often add a &quot;permalink&quot; link to the RES tag pointing to a post that caused the tag.</p>

<p>RES tagging is a great tool to mark positive &amp; negative posters that stand out. </p>

<p>RES tags help me to know other redditors more deeply &amp; to sort mindsets I find healthy &amp; ill. </p>

<p>IMO if all used RES tagging then many that are widely considered shills &amp; trolls would not gain traction easily. </p>

<p>If tons of comments in a thread are made, then tags of posters I enjoy reading stick out like easily like finding a neon blinking waldo in a room of time sucking confusion due to waldos regular bland stripes [u/whomever] blending easily in the crowd.</p>

<p>RES tagging opens the opportunity for group participation of no longer needed mod instituted bans by sorting &amp; shunning @ user level.</p>

<p>I find it fun &amp; interesting to see redditors whom I mark with probationary caution as potentially negative to sometimes make positive comments I upvote &amp; agree with. </p>

<p>It is IMO important to give users a cautionary chance if they are not blatantly acting negatively &amp; merely slightly negative. On more than one occasion I have changed a yellow or red tag to a green one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only have a tiny handful that I downvote <em>almost</em> no matter what they post, to label spot them to easily seek them out to shun them as they act continually in ill fashion. These few redditors consist of foul rude posters that are IMO very very ill not adding to discussion ever that I have seen &amp; only after many strikes have they slowly made their way to becoming marked as such. <em>I still glance to read their comments before I downvote</em>, but do not need to spend as much time making the determination to downvote. <em>I imagine that if one day I read real change in their ways</em> then they have a chance to lose such a tag.</p>

<p>I do not immediately mark anyone for a heat seeking and almost instant downvote due to a first seen ill comment, as it takes much to get there. I think all humans have ill days where all individuals behave ignorantly. </p>

<p>Example: Racist comments I often mark descriptively to slowly sort out hard core racists from a person whom may have had a recent spell of acting out in a racist way. If a purple persons wife got raped by a green dude it is normal to have some racist stereotype behavior toward all green people to vent off tension to release. I do not condone such behavior, but I suspect all humans likely on rare occasion act in such a wide paint stroking ill way upon entire groups of others once in a while. A hardcore racist is not often worth my time to converse a position of tolerance to, whereas a person whom simply uses a racial slur once in a while often is worth sharing my energy in such a way with. NOTE: I do find most extreme racist of all types are often very deep rational thinkers in other areas of topic &amp; I do often upvote people that would likely hate me or others in person only on surface value. </p>

<p>I hate the ignorance often displayed by David Duke &amp; Louis Farrakhan, but find both on occasion to be very intelligent in positional points. I do not subscribe to their main positions, but I imagine both on occasion would get a few upvote points from me. Every word they utter is not ill like those on my tiny see change or likely shell &amp; shun to destroy list.</p>

<p>Most often my RES tags just attempt to assist me to get to know peoples mindsets &amp; positional postures.  Extremes &amp; noteworthy positions can be labeled with RES &amp; I find it most helpful. I often label political positions if seemingly stuck like glue to one position in ill fashion no matter what.  I would label my self hostile toward police, military, illite, politics &amp; much other stuff, mostly of the ill machine. I often label seemingly anti homosexuality haters &amp; pro homosexuality extremists, whereas most when discussing the topic of homosexuality are not either of those extremes &amp; not worthy of a RES tag of any sort to me.</p>

<p>It is often helpful to know peoples key areas of hard like &amp; dislike interests: aliens, freemasons, illuminati, banking, police state, ill machine, greed, eN-S-A, anti war &amp; pro war type stuff. </p>

<p>No. You have only conceded that the CESARE memo refutes the NIST report. This is literally the first time you&#39;ve said that you don&#39;t have the knowledge to refute the memo. So how could I previously accept this &quot;answer&quot; when it didn&#39;t exist before?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even need &quot;knowledge&quot; to understand some of the points made by CESARE. For example.</p>

<p>&quot;when the beam subsequently buckles, it is also REMOVED from the analysis. This is quite unrealistic.&quot;</p>

<p>Did beams vanish in the actual collapse once they buckled? No. They did not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only have a tiny handful that I downvote <em>almost</em> no matter what they post, to label spot them to easily seek them out to shun them as they act continually in ill fashion. These few redditors consist of foul rude posters that are IMO very very ill not adding to discussion ever that I have seen &amp; only after many strikes have they slowly made their way to becoming marked as such. <em>I still glance to read their comments before I downvote</em>, but do not need to spend as much time making the determination to downvote. <em>I imagine that if one day I read real change in their ways</em> then they have a chance to lose such a tag.</p>

<p>I do not immediately mark anyone for a heat seeking and almost instant downvote due to a first seen ill comment, as it takes much to get there. I think all humans have ill days where all individuals behave ignorantly. </p>

<p>Example: Racist comments I often mark descriptively to slowly sort out hard core racists from a person whom may have had a recent spell of acting out in a racist way. If a purple persons wife got raped by a green dude it is normal to have some racist stereotype behavior toward all green people to vent off tension to release. I do not condone such behavior, but I suspect all humans likely on rare occasion act in such a wide paint stroking ill way upon entire groups of others once in a while. A hardcore racist is not often worth my time to converse a position of tolerance to, whereas a person whom simply uses a racial slur once in a while often is worth sharing my energy in such a way with. NOTE: I do find most extreme racist of all types are often very deep rational thinkers in other areas of topic &amp; I do often upvote people that would likely hate me or others in person only on surface value. </p>

<p>I hate the ignorance often displayed by David Duke &amp; Louis Farrakhan, but find both on occasion to be very intelligent in positional points. I do not subscribe to their main positions, but I imagine both on occasion would get a few upvote points from me. Every word they utter is not ill like those on my tiny see change or likely shell &amp; shun to destroy list.</p>

<p>Most often my RES tags just attempt to assist me to get to know peoples mindsets &amp; positional postures.  Extremes &amp; noteworthy positions can be labeled with RES &amp; I find it most helpful. I often label political positions if seemingly stuck like glue to one position in ill fashion no matter what.  I would label my self hostile toward police, military, illite, politics &amp; much other stuff, mostly of the ill machine. I often label seemingly anti homosexuality haters &amp; pro homosexuality extremists, whereas most when discussing the topic of homosexuality are not either of those extremes &amp; not worthy of a RES tag of any sort to me.</p>

<p>It is often helpful to know peoples key areas of hard like &amp; dislike interests: aliens, freemasons, illuminati, banking, police state, ill machine, greed, eN-S-A, anti war &amp; pro war type stuff. </p>
