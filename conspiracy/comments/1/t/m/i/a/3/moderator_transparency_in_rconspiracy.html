        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">70</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-12-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/sunshine-x.html">sunshine-x</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Given the recent hubbub surrounding the actions of certain mods, I thought I&#39;d make this post to inform and remind everyone about a great tool at your disposal.</p>

<p>Many may not realize it but you, the community of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, have a tool available to you that provides you with visibility into the actions taken by the moderator team here.  This is exceptionally rare on Reddit.</p>

<p>First, a little history.  Did you know that the Admins <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1iug6d/moderators_you_can_now_filter_the_moderation_log/cb8nxqo?context=10">intentionally prevent</a> moderators from making their moderation logs public?  I&#39;ve requested the feature many times, and even though it could be optional and only enabled should moderators choose to, the Admins have chosen to prevent moderators from easily disclosing their actions.</p>

<p>In addition to not offering moderators with this simple feature, the admins have gone so far as not providing the moderation log via API calls - you can&#39;t access the mod logs without scraping and parsing the HTML.  This intentionally makes it significantly more laborious and intensive to read the logs programatically.  </p>

<p>The moderators and community of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> loathe censorship.  The mods wanted a way to make their actions visible to the public, but there was no way to do so directly in Reddit.  To address this intentional gap in reddit functionality, I created a bot that runs under <a href="/u/uncensorship">/u/uncensorship</a> and populates <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> with metadata about moderator actions. It&#39;s a simple bot that scrapes the mod logs, parses them, and posts the activities to <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> in tagged searchable way.  </p>

<p>So, how do you make use of this tool?  Simple - Visit <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> and search for &quot;conspiracy&quot; or any other of the participating subreddits.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?q=conspiracy&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on">link</a> to some search results, where you can see what your mod team is up to.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a moderator of a subreddit and wish to participate, please contact me and I&#39;ll work with you to get it set up.  I&#39;ll provide this service to any who wish to participate, and hope that one day the Admins will decide to offer this level of transparency directly as a Reddit feature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we could use several more moderators here. Ones that will tackle the problem of the <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mocking</strong> is not discussion, neither is attacking the <strong>notion</strong> of conspiracy. Conspiracies are happening all the time in every area of life. It takes intuitive minds to begin to uncover these, and this is the very concept that is under attack in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Vote brigading and black ops from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are the most damaging things to this subreddit, and this aggression will not stand.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn&#39;t matter what other subs think of the people here</strong>. What matters is that those people are not permitted to come in and make a mockery of the ideals of this subreddit. Let them have <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. We don&#39;t want them shut down, we just want them to stop harassing us.</p>

<p>We can solve this quite easily with several new moderators who will be vigilant in removing them whenever they create new troll accounts. I would love to be <strong>one</strong> of several to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Delete both values and their downvotes become meaningless.</strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> is great I use it at <a href="/r/POLITIC">/r/POLITIC</a> as well, so does <a href="/r/altnewz">/r/altnewz</a>  and now even <a href="/r/TrueReddit">/r/TrueReddit</a></p>

<p>I try to get as many sub-reddits as possible using <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> it&#39;s a great tool.</p>

<p>I started <a href="/r/ModerationLog">/r/ModerationLog</a> shortly after the admins implemented the (private) Moderation Log and held back release of an option to enable public logs:</p>

<p>A feature implemented nearly 2 years ago but still not released:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ov7rt/moderators_feedback_requested_on_enabling_public/">http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ov7rt/moderators_feedback_requested_on_enabling_public/</a></p>

<p>Though in defense of the reddit admins; they allow me to run <a href="/r/ModerationLog">/r/ModerationLog</a> (an involuntary version of uncensorship that does not require moderator cooperation) as long as I limit it to political subreddits; respect API rate limits; and do not have it automatically PM people.</p>

<p>This is despite numerous calls from larger subreddits monitored by ModerationLog to ban the bot.</p>

<p><a href="/r/ModerationLog">/r/ModerationLog</a> monitors <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as well because it just seems appropriate (and helps me check accuracy against uncensorship)</p>

<p>On the topic of being shadow banned, in case anyone reading this is wondering how they can check, it&#39;s simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be sure you&#39;re logged in.</li>
<li>Make a comment replying to this post.</li>
<li>Log out.</li>
<li>Return to this post while logged out, and look for your comment. </li>
<li>If your comment is missing while you&#39;re logged out, you are shadow banned, and this can only be corrected through petitioning the Admins (not the Moderators, they don&#39;t control this).</li>
</ol>

<p>If I&#39;ve missed something or have a mistake in the procedure please correct me.</p>
