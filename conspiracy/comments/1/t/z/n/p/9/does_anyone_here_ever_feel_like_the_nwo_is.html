    <div class="md"><p>Frankly, I don&#39;t think they would spend 5 minutes worrying about you unless you join the ultra-hysterical &quot;let&#39;s shoot down a chemtrail plane&quot; crowd. Babbling on about the NWO, vinegar, auditory hallucinations, chemtrails, and how the government shills on Reddit are trying to silence you, paints you as a paranoid nutcase. I notice that the usual people who post about these supposed conspiracies are nowhere to be seen – perhaps even they think you&#39;re a bit too unhinged to support. It&#39;s a shame because you have a lot of energy which you are wasting by tilting at windmills. As a farmer you are rightly concerned about GMOs and their effect on health and the ecology. Now this is a real threat, unlike the rest which is just hysterical bullshit. Concentrate on that and forget the rest of your perceived problems, and people may take you a bit more seriously in future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, i dont think that is the case. If you try and figure out your exact influence on society, and cross reference that proportionately to the damage you alone are causing to TPTBs agenda, youll find that you, and each on of us here, are quite insignificant. They may listen, but to actively interfere woukd require much more resources, and unless you broadcast to a bunch of people like alex jones or whoever, i think they be bored with you, and with me, and with most everyone here...</p>

<p>Because in order to determine if exposure to a substance and miscarriages are linked, you need to know both if a subject/subject&#39;s family has experience a miscarriage, and what their mean exposure level is to the the substance. </p>

<p>You get both of these by asking the subjects these questions.</p>

<p>In a questionnaire. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to write off entire fields of mainstream science in order to try to prove a point, then you&#39;re obviously not to terribly bound in empiricism, so it looks likely that we&#39;re so epistemologically separated that not much is going to come of further discussion.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the three issues which should be of most concern on the basis of established science receive little or no discussion. These are: 1. that introducing the same gene into 2 different types of cells can produce two very distinct protein molecules; 2. the recent observations that the introduction of any gene, be it from a different or the same species, always significantly changes overall gene expression and therefore the phenotype of the recipient cell; and 3. the possibility that enzymatic pathways introduced to synthesize small molecules such as vitamins can interact with endogenous pathways to produce novel molecules. The potential consequence of all of these perturbations could be the production of biomolecules that are either toxic or carcinogenic, and there is no a priori way of predicting the outcome.</p>

<p>2 different types of cells can produce two very distinct protein molecules;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of any known instances in GMO&#39;s where this is the case, but it certainly could plausibly occur due to ribosomal differences between the crops and the donor species. In any case the currently marketed GMO&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be Roundup resistant if this protein molecules differed substantially from that of the donor species (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the recent observations that the introduction of any gene, be it from a different or the same species, always significantly changes overall gene expression and therefore the phenotype of the recipient cell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any papers that claim this either, but I suspect it is true, but not worrying. The whole point of genetic modification is to induce beneficial phenotypic differences in the organisms, and if &quot;significant&quot; is being used here in a scientific context, as I suspect it is, then it&#39;s just a recapitulation of something we already know; that gene modification changes the plant. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>the possibility that enzymatic pathways introduced to synthesize small molecules such as vitamins can interact with endogenous pathways to produce novel molecules.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>There certainly might be such enzymatic pathways, but we don&#39;t currently know of any specific ones  and don&#39;t have any particular reason to expect to find one. If we do find such a specific pathway though, that will certainly merit further investigation and ultimately may change the landscape of the GMO safety debate. </p>

<p>I will note that such pathways have been founds for herbicides such as Roundup, but those are distinct from pathways that could occur due to genetic modification of plants. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>could be the production of biomolecules that are either toxic or carcinogenic, and there is no a priori way of predicting the outcome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is mostly correct if such chemical pathways do exist, but like I said, there&#39;s no compelling evidence to indicate that is the case. I say it&#39;s only mostly correct, because even if such a pathway were found, it still could be studied sufficiently to show whether or not in will lead to increased toxicity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could be nothing further from the truth.  Those willing to buy propaganda without evidence may support GMO.  While those who are true intellectuals that demand independent, long term human safety studies are the ones I align myself with, and view as correct.  As stated, long term human health studies performed by independent, unassociated people and groups has simply not occurred.  Until this happens, you are utterly foolish to believe the meritless human safety.  Look to our past to see how reckless this type of behavior is.  </p>

<p>People, such as these fictional experts you speak of, claimed asbestos was perfectly safe for humans.  It was the absoutely ideal substance.  As did 9 out of 10 doctors for cigarette and tobacco safety (paid for, of course, by big tobacco).  They pushed and pushed publicly until the evidence to the contrary was overwhelming to claim any further.  Don&#39;t be foolish with your own health.  Trust nothing until independent science is in your court.  Today, they most certainly are not.</p>

<p>I suppose the authors of this paper will be alarmed to find themselves fictional, but I digress.

<blockquote>
<p>While you&#39;re at it, please also share the results of an independent long-term human study on the safety of GMO for regular human consumption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absent a plausible physical mechanism for increased toxicity in GMO crops, there is no need for a long term study to evaluate the long-term safety. Even when human studies are (unnecessarily) done, the goalposts get moved and it&#39;s claimed they aren&#39;t &quot;long-term&quot; enough. So, to remove any vagueness from your argument and to preclude any goalpost moving, when do you consider a study on GMO&#39;s &quot;long-term&quot; and motivate it, scientifically, as to why that should be the cut of. </p>

<p>Like I said though, long-term studies aren&#39;t necessary when there isn&#39;t a plausible physical mechanism for increased toxicity. So to look at a specific case, by what chemical pathway do you suggest a modified 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase in Roundup Ready soybeans leads to increased toxicity in humans? Be specific. </p>

<p>You can browse through my comment history if you like, or I may compile the salient points into a blog post later, but what I&#39;ve said above here should stand on it&#39;s own even if I don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then shill on, ponyboy.  To waive forum rules to support a lie you claim as truth?  For some reason WE DONT BELIEVE YOU.  As was said about the laundry list I provided earlier.  Only someone this lacking in brainpower would ever claim that lomg-term, independent human studies are <strong>NOT</strong> required.  Were not that stupid, and can see clearly through you.  The fact you must spread lies is the only proof I need to expose your bullshit.</p>

<p>No, don&#39;t say. Show. Provide evidence that it untrustworthy. Provide evidence that show&#39;s the results couldn&#39;t be replicated, or the methodology was flawed in some sort of critical manner. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve to let me know what you consider a &quot;long-term&quot; study, and I&#39;m not about to go out and find one so that you can move the goals posts and ignore it. Further, scientifically motivate the need for such a study, because tons of things we encounter in our everyday lives are considered safe, even without your achieving your arbitrary gold standard of &quot; INDEPENDENT, LONG TERM HUMAN STUDIES&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do brigade my comments.  Several of them have been linked and they downvote the heck out of me.  They have even x-posted to Subredditdrama and they joined in.  If you look at my posts however, most of them are positive (240 karma as of now).</p>

<p>As for not joining in the Snowden is a hero circlejerk, I do believe its possible the whole scenario is one big setup.  Its designed to get the public used to spying.  Its a means of control.  If the people know they may be being watched they are a lot less likely to do anything to upset the status quo.</p>

<p>As for the rest, those are my theories or what I believe to be possible.  Not everything I post is what I believe 100%, just what may be true.  The HIV video for example is just something that I found interesting.  The rest of it well maybe you need to open your mind a little bit more.  If its too out there for you or makes me look like a troll so be it.  Please skip my posts then.  There are others I can discuss those things here with.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need a doctor, I&#39;m more than a functioning adult who takes care of a profitable farm and 2 kids on his own.  Thanks for your concern though.</p>
