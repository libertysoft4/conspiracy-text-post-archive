    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people think Sandy Hook is a false flag. There seem to be a lot of unanswered questions that cause people to doubt the official story and it&#39;s not just, this story. This doubt and distrust of our government did not occur in a vacuum. What ever the truth is, the message I take from all this controversy is that people are fearing and distrusting their government in larger and larger numbers. I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t think all this will end well. I hope I am wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine what the forefathers of our country would thing. We are under a MUCH more oppressive and controlling government that the average working man has absolutely no real say in. They had a revolution the first time that happened. </p>

<p>Not to sound crazy here but does anyone think that there needs to be a 2nd American revolution? </p>

<p>It seems we are beyond just trying to vote the best people into office because there are too few people that actually want to help our country. We need a system of government that is truly accountable to the people, and for the people. Not the other way around. It is OUR America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is totally true, not only for America but to show the world it can be done, to inspire change that starts with the people and reaches the top. Those people, like you and me, need to be held accountable for their actions.
My only fear you could say, is that people don&#39;t do enough now to educate others and brake free of this system that has enslaved people into a routine of work and consumption followed by the &quot;I work hard so I party hard attitude&quot; &quot;because I deserve it&quot;... This mindset is poison for the public, everyone wants to fill their emptiness with materialistic things that they think will make them happy, for which they need to continue working at a job they hate, then instead of getting involved in their country&#39;s affairs, they watch a bunch of overpaid guys on skates beating the crap out of each other and they think that makes them patriotic. </p>

<p>The truth is, in 5-10 years the skies will be filled with drones that could potentially eliminate a threat by only using their cellphone or much less. Robotics is getting really close to a humanoid robot, tptb won&#39;t even need brainwashed military personnel to carry out their dirty work, aside from their biological weapons, which I&#39;m sure were created... Who knows, we could all already be infected, it&#39;s as easy as the common cold that gets passed around (think the game plague inc.), there&#39;s nothing to say we&#39;re not all infected with a dormant virus that could be triggered in many different ways (biological factors/electromagnetic waves) since the 40s/50s there has been a race for technological advancement, most of what they were working on then still hasn&#39;t been released, wonder what new things science has discovered that we have no fucking clue about. I know I went a little tinfoil mad hatter with this.... But it&#39;s not that far fetched.. And time... Were running out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But no one ever explains <em>why</em> the government would bother doing this.</p>

<p>People keep saying gun control.  But there is never any gun control.  There isn&#39;t even a serious attempt at gun control.  Each year there are more guns in private hands in the US than the previous year.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust the government at all.  There are numerous things that they say that are impossible to believe.  </p>

<p>The most recent big one is the Bin Laden assassination - where there are no witnesses, no photos, no corroborating evidence at all, and the first story they released was completely different from the final one.  </p>

<p>And you can certainly understand why the government would want to claim that they got Bin Laden - particularly if they in fact knew he was already dead (which would explain why we&#39;d seen nothing from him in many years).</p>

<p>But killing a bunch of kids?  Why?</p>

<p>There&#39;s another point, and that&#39;s &quot;the number of psychopaths involved&quot;.  I have no doubt that there are a lot of people at the top who are out and out psychos and have no idea of good and evil - BUT the majority of the people working in law enforcement <em>believe</em> that they are doing the right thing &quot;to protect the country&quot;.</p>

<p>If Sandy Hook was a false flag, that means that literally thousands of people are in on it.  I&#39;m sorry, I just don&#39;t believe that there are that many psychopaths all working together so efficiently.  People like kids - you&#39;re not going to be able to convince the average police officer, &quot;Oh, we need to brutally murder all these children so we can use this to get gun control in.&quot;</p>

<p>Massacres happen all the time, in countries all over the world.  This is another one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>try googling &#39;bauman brothers&#39; and look at the very silly picture one CT newspaper ran with. two people have redeye in the photo one doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>letsrollforums had an arguing match with various people who claim to be buddies with some of the main actors at Boston, letsroll got sent or found a new photo of &#39;jeff&#39; and his younger brother laughing/posing for the camera, &#39;jeff&#39; looks the same age as the triple bauman brother photos does from ten years ago.</p>

<p>the guy with no legs at Boston was the veteran Vogt, &#39;jeff&#39; is the post event &#39;jeff&#39;, lost both legs in a violent bomb blast and ten days later cavorting around at sports events waving flags , BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a VERY strong contingent of people online that do NOT want the truth about this blackest of &#39;black ops&#39; coming out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same group that refuses to even consider that 9/11 was nothing but ritual occult sacrifice by Israel and certain non-Jewish members of our own government.</p>

<p>The Sandy Hook story falls apart in SO very many places...it almost makes me be ashamed to be American that so many of my own countrymen cannot or simply WILL NOT see it for what it is...a well-planned yet mistakenly executed operation to further the agenda of the anti-second amendment &#39;movement&#39; that is currently taking place against American citizens.</p>

<p>Almost EVERY infantryman, when confronted with simply the details of the story and the timeline can figure this out for themselves.</p>

<p>Please read about the &#39;Port Arthur Massacre&#39; for further details. I mean...Sandy Hook wasn&#39;t even an original story!</p>

<p>So saddening that people continue to &#39;buy&#39; this utter bullshit...each and every time.</p>

<p>I asked this in the other thread about Aurora. What&#39;s the conspiracy, here again? Is it gun control? Because there is actually net less gun control in the country today than before sandy hook:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/despite-mass-shootings-gun-control-advocates-losing-ground-in-the-states/2013/09/21/25b8ce72-22de-11e3-a358-1144dee636dd_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/despite-mass-shootings-gun-control-advocates-losing-ground-in-the-states/2013/09/21/25b8ce72-22de-11e3-a358-1144dee636dd_story.html</a></p>

<p>Mass shootings in general do little to affect gun control policy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/mass-shootings-do-little-to-change-state-gun-laws">http://www.propublica.org/article/mass-shootings-do-little-to-change-state-gun-laws</a></p>

<p>So are we still on the Obama&#39;s-gonna-take-our-gunz thing? Or have we moved on to it-was-a-mind-control-experiment(maybe to take our guns later)? Hopefully the latter as it&#39;s just a tad less insulting to the victims  - but either way, get a grip folks.</p>

Did you have to go and provide a thumb print for your legally purchased rifles yesterday and an affidavit for your standard capacity magazines or chance going to jail come next Wednesday? I did. By the way, all of my rifles were purchased legally after I went through a very rigorous process of getting my CCW (including fingerprinting).  </p>

<p>The line in Middletown was out the door for hours and hours (as it has been for weeks).  These measures will never prevent a mass shooting. Why? Because criminals don&#39;t care about gun laws, or any law for that matter. There is significantly more gun control in CT today than there was before Sandy Hook and it&#39;s getting worse.</p>

<p>When they tried passing the gun laws last year, they had one of the largest turnouts ever to oppose it. And it was defeated as it was every year prior. Sandy Hook happens and they almost instantly pass the law (complete with legislators failing to read the bill). </p>

<p>Your initial links don&#39;t prove your thesis that mass shootings don&#39;t impact gun control in America- that has soundly been proven factually incorrect.

<p>Gun-control advocates had hoped to pass new legislation in states where Democrats control the legislature and governor’s office. But <strong>only a handful of blue states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland and New York — advanced substantive laws.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But gun-rights advocates have pushed new laws in about half the states to relax restrictions on concealed-carry laws. Legislators in Kansas and Missouri passed laws that would nullify federal gun legislation, although Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) vetoed his state’s version. And in Illinois, the only state that didn’t allow residents to carry concealed weapons, legislators overrode Gov. Pat Quinn’s (D) veto of a new concealed-carry law.</p>

<p>A new Alaska law prohibits state and municipal agencies from implementing laws that would infringe on the Second Amendment and exempts some firearms from federal regulation. Several Arkansas laws expanded concealed-carry rules for liquor stores and churches (North Dakota concealed-carry permit holders may now also possess a gun in church). In Missouri, Nixon signed a bill to allow state employees to keep firearms in their vehicles on state property. Mississippi enacted a law that would extend concealed-carry permits to people ages 18 to 21.</p>

<p>And several states — including Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia — passed laws that loosen restrictions on guns carried by school safety officials, steps similar to those advocated by National Rifle Association officials after the shooting in Newtown.</p>

<p>On the local level, more than three dozen county and city governments have revised bans on guns in certain public places at the behest of the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights organization based in Washington state.</p>

<p>This year, the city of Oak Harbor, Wash., overturned a ban on guns in city parks. Carroll County, Md., overturned a ban on carrying a firearm at county landfills. Other jurisdictions have backed off gun bans in public places that don’t conform to preexisting state rules.</p>

<p>“In the last several years, we’ve had a lot of state legislatures take a position that we think is pretty bright, that firearms legislation belongs in the hands of state legislatures so that you have uniform firearms laws from one end of the state to the other,” said <strong>Dave Workman, a senior editor of TheGunMag.com and communications director at the Second Amendment Foundation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“I think there have been more wins for firearms rights than for the gun-control crowd,” Workman said.</strong></p>

<p>One man&#39;s opinions don&#39;t equal reality. Your premise was that mass shootings don&#39;t prompt gun control laws. I showed you they prompted three countries to ban guns.

I proved that to be incorrect- showing you federal legislation passed after Virginia Tech, laws passed as a reaction to Sandy Hook, and laws passed as a reaction to Aurora. </p>

<p>Below you can read how, one month after Sandy Hook, the White House and State legislatures forged ahead with an agenda to- wait for it- strengthen gun control laws and penalties. </p>

<p>Your premise that mass shootings don&#39;t prompt gun control laws is false. </p>

<p>I dunno, a senior editor of TheGunMag.com and communications director at the Second Amendment Foundation seems like pretty strong credentials for such an assertion to me. But really, what matters is the paragraphs above that quote which you probably didn&#39;t even read.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>My original premise was exactly as follows(see original post):</p>

<p>Mass shootings in general do little to affect gun control policy.</p>

<p>This is backed up by an extensive look at shootings in general across this country. We&#39;re not in Australia or Finland, so excuse me if the mind control shootings for gun control worked there(to preempt the totalitarian police states those nations have become) - they largely don&#39;t here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/mass-shootings-do-little-to-change-state-gun-laws">http://www.propublica.org/article/mass-shootings-do-little-to-change-state-gun-laws</a></p>

<p>This is further supported by the fact that there was more <em>reduction</em> of gun control in the country as a whole in the year after Sandy Hook - the worst mass shooting in recent memory - than tightening of regulations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One month after a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., the White House and various State legislatures forge ahead with proposals for legislation to strengthen gun control laws and penalties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they failed on the federal level(which is kind of a shame given how widely the particular measure - background checks - was supported). A handful of strongly liberal states with already strict gun control tightened their own - are you surprised by this? I guess they didn&#39;t do enough mind controlled mass shootings in the rest of the country(maybe the other shootings mentioned in the above article, like the Ft Hood shooting after which no gun control legislation was even entertained in the state congress, were not mind control mass shootings).</p>

<p>One has to wonder why, though, if they are capable of remote mind control that they don&#39;t simply have all gun owners in the country turn their guns in or shoot themselves. Or why they didn&#39;t make the shootings much worse? Surely that is within the realm of possibility and their own capabilities if they are capable and willing of staging mass shootings with mind control assailants in the first place(seems to be a foregone conclusion for some people).</p>

<p>Never, <em>ever</em> could we consider that, statistically speaking, mass shootings <em>will</em> happen in a country such as ours with a significantly large population and the highest gun ownership per capita(well, except for Yemen). No, it&#39;s the government using mind control to encourage us to give up our guns, because if there&#39;s one thing they&#39;re afraid of when they sick the military on us to kick off the totalitarian police state, it&#39;s pockets of armed civilians.</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> <em>one</em> person could possibly be mind controlled to conduct a mass shooting, then, surely, <strong>every</strong> gun owner in America could be mind controlled to voluntarily hand in their guns or <strong>shoot themselves.</strong> This is as preposterous as your assertion that if the CIA didn&#39;t want information in our hands they would simply censor it.

<p>You&#39;re right, and this proves my point even moreso.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What prompted the last, successful, federal gun control legislation? The mass shooting at Virginia Tech.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was that a staged mind control shooting as well? Just curious. It appears to be more of a grab bag of gun regulation and repeal, just so you know:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 23-year-old Virginia Tech student Seung Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty members at the university in April 2007, then-Gov. Tim Kaine assigned a blue-ribbon task force to examine gun policies in the state. The task force made <strong>dozens of recommendations</strong> that, among other things, suggested that the state intensify background checks for gun purchasers, and ban firearm possession on college campuses. <strong>None of the recommendations became law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The most significant change in Virginia</strong> came two weeks after the shooting when Kaine signed an executive order requiring the names of all people involuntarily committed to mental health facilities to be provided to a federal database called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. Licensed gun dealers are supposed to check the database before they sell anyone a gun.</p>

<p><strong>President George W. Bush subsequently signed federal legislation requiring all states to submit their mental health records to NICS, but to gain the support of the NRA, Congress agreed to two concessions. It made changes to the way the government defined who was &quot;mentally defective,&quot; excluding people, for example, who had been &quot;fully released or discharged&quot; from mandatory treatment. The law also gave mentally ill people an avenue for restoring their gun rights if they could prove to a court that they had been rehabilitated. After the law passed, the NRA pushed state lawmakers to limit roadblocks for people applying to regain their rights.</strong> [this is the federal &#39;gun control&#39; you&#39;re talking about]</p>

<p>Virginia is particularly open to restoring peoples&#39; gun rights. <strong>A 2011 New York Times investigation found that the restoration process in the state allowed some people to regain access to guns simply by writing a letter to the state. Others were permitted to carry guns just weeks or months after being hospitalized for psychiatric treatment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This past year the Virginia state legislature repealed a law that had barred people from buying more than one handgun per month</strong> — a law put in place because so many guns purchased in Virginia were later used in crimes committed in states with more restrictions.</p>

<p>The legislature also has made several changes to its gun permitting process. <strong>In March, the state eliminated municipalities&#39; ability to require fingerprints as part of a concealed weapon permit application. The state used to require gun owners to undergo training with a certified instructor in order to get permits, but in 2009 it adopted a law allowing people to take an hour-long online test instead.</strong> Since Virginia adopted the law, the number of concealed handgun permits the state has issued increased dramatically and many of the permits were issued to people who live in other states where Virginia permits are accepted.</p>

<p><strong>In 2010, Virginia became one of five states to allow permit holders to carry concealed and loaded weapons into bars and restaurants.</strong></p>

<p>The issue is not black and white, though overall there seems to be less gun control today in VA than before the shooting. Let me know when horrendous mass shootings start increasing in frequency, and maybe I&#39;ll consider that the government is behind it - using mind control - to encourage the public to cry for more gun control. You&#39;re not making a strong case that this is what&#39;s happening. Good job poking some small semantic holes in my argument, though.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Except any resource-rich state actor could, and they do. Methinks you are not well versed in how the Internet works or how it came to be, and if anything the NSA revelations should be some indication to you as to how deeply ingrained the US government is in the world&#39;s communications at the lowest levels. The same goes for China and their own people&#39;s communications, vis-a-vis their &quot;participation&quot;(read: their own massive intranet) in the Internet-at-large.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Information disappearing and every gun owner killing themselves isn&#39;t only impossible, but, also, undesirable</p>

<p>Well, if disarming the populace is the goal and remote mind control of untold capabilities is possible, I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t not only be possible but desirable.</p>

<p>Likewise, while I find your assertion that every gun owner could be made to kill themselves ridiculous, it wouldn&#39;t be prudent to do- even if this were the desired goal- as, again, the populace would demand answers. </p>

<p>Your logic is that I&#39;m talking about <em>present tense</em>. That I&#39;m talking about active censorship from the given shooting onwards. I&#39;m not. Frankly, you&#39;re misinterpreting what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>If the government had mind control techniques in the 60s and were planning to use them against its own citizens decades later - noone would have had bonafide proof of such things and it certainly would never have made its way on the Internet <em>to begin with</em> - Church committee and the media or otherwise. Any attempt to discuss <em>any</em> sensitive subject at all would simply not occur on the Internet(unencrypted, anyways). We&#39;re talking about something that is simply of such magnitude for them <em>not</em> to take similar measures. Please do some reading on how the Internet came to be. Do some reading on how it works. Watch that TED talk. I am not describing &quot;those existing webpages have disappeared&quot;.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, if the government was planning this grand scheme of rounding the populace up in camps(or whatever evil you think), we wouldn&#39;t be having this sort of discussion because <em>we&#39;d already be in the camps</em>. Unless of course you&#39;re suggesting this high level evil in government is a new development in the last decade or two. People have cried this sort of wolf for decades. It&#39;s always <em>just</em> around the corner.</p>

<p><em>Yet here we are</em>, discussing this sort of thing openly. Oodles of details about how pervasive NSA spying is. God knows how many other discussions about and plotting against this supposed totalitarian nightmare that&#39;s ever-always-around-the-corner. This, to me, speaks to a lack of such a plot. When we&#39;re talking about an organization as powerful as the government, if you&#39;re actually <em>on</em> to something as immense in scope and illegality as what you&#39;re suggesting, wouldn&#39;t you expect boots kicking in your door? But no, they wouldn&#39;t - it&#39;s easier to write it off as crazy talk, correct? Sure. But then we must arrive at the conclusion that either <em>you&#39;re right, and you&#39;ve figured it all out</em> - it&#39;s mind control, they want our guns because that&#39;s what they&#39;re afraid of or what is stopping them - or, the hypothesis that much more readily satisfies Occam&#39;s razor is correct: it <em>is</em> crazy talk, and there really is nothing more to the story(at least, with these particular incidents).</p>

<p>Because if I posited a theory that was true the omniscient government would immediately come kick down my door, drag me away, and erase all evidence of what I&#39;ve written on the internet? That seems paranoid and irrational to me. </p>

<p>The internet could have been developed with DARPA having total control over everything on it? Maybe. It&#39;s feasible, sure, but, here, in reality, the US government isn&#39;t censoring what&#39;s written on the internet. It&#39;s a moot point. </p>

<p>But do you not admit that they could have? DARPA would have been well within their capabilities to do such a thing - it certainly seems prudent to do so given the magnitude of what you&#39;re suggesting.</p>

<p>DARPA could censor what&#39;s on the internet. As I&#39;ve said before, it would prompt US citizens to demand answers if, suddenly, all information on mind control was <em>deleted from the internet</em>. So, no that wouldn&#39;t be prudent at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s first establish that not only can they do it <em>now</em> but it&#39;s beyond censorship or shilling. This is <em>beyond</em> certainty. You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about here when it comes to the feasibility of such a thing. Your entire argument here also rests on the notion that there was undesirable speech in the first place and that it would be &#39;crushed&#39; after the fact.</p>

<p>Secondly,  <em>because</em> the government created the Internet, they could have engineered it such that nobody could discuss or conglomerate theories and evidence of such a <em>massive</em>, overarching conspiracy that <em>they themselves are perpetrating</em> if it were even <em>close</em> to the truth.

<p>Because the government created the internet they could have engineered it such that if topics that it wants censored were discussed on Reddit, for example, they would be automatically censored? That doesn&#39;t make sense. If they started censoring certain topics, wouldn&#39;t even skeptical people like you demand answers? </p>

<p>Your premise, seems to be, that we must not be talking about a valid conspiracy because, otherwise, the government would censor it. You seem to think the totalitarian state is already here, and the only reason our discourse here is even allowed is because it isn&#39;t valid. However, the moment we say something the government disapproves of they will immediately censor it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why didn&#39;t they? How are we having this conversation now? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government isn&#39;t omniscient. Yes, they have the ability to censor things. What would happen if they started to censor things they don&#39;t like? You mention shilling. Why do you think they shill as opposed to just censor and remove? Because it&#39;s more effective, or because they fear what the populace would do if they were as blatant as China? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>or the vastly more likely scenario that it is crazy talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I showed you a Navy document discussing the approval authority for human experiments involving severe and unusual physical and psychological intrusions involving mind control. The document was from 2006. </p>

<p>Who do you think they are doing these experiments on? </p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t the government just removed it from the internet? Well, it was leaked, accidentally. </p>

<p>However, the government did remove the US Army page on microwave weapons that put voices into people&#39;s head. They called it V2K for Voice to Skull. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/05/army-removes-pa/">http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/05/army-removes-pa/</a>
Army Yanks ‘Voice-To-Skull Devices’ Site</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entry, still available on the Federation of American Scientists‘ website reads:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonlethal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals. NOTE: The sound modulation may be voice or audio subliminal messages. One application of V2K is use as an electronic scarecrow to frighten birds in the vicinity of airports.</p>

<p>Maybe they control the dissemination of sensitive information the best that they can, without blatantly censoring things. I think that information was never meant to be on the Army&#39;s website, but, due to human error, it was for a brief time. </p>

<p>What do you think? </p>

This is because the armed populace is the only thing keeping them in check, and mass shootings always directly(or even a majority of the time) lead to gun control. Seems legit.</p>

<p>One has to wonder why, though, if they are capable of remote mind control that they don&#39;t simply have all gun owners in the country turn their guns in or shoot themselves. Or why they didn&#39;t make the shootings much worse? Surely that is within the realm of possibility and their own capabilities if they are capable and willing of staging mass shootings with mind control assailants in the first place(seems to be a foregone conclusion for some people).</p>

<p>Never, ever could we consider that, statistically speaking, mass shootings will happen in a country such as ours with a significantly large population and the highest gun ownership per capita(well, except for Yemen). No, it&#39;s the government using mind control to encourage us to give up our guns, because if there&#39;s one thing they&#39;re afraid of when they sick the military on us to kick off the totalitarian police state, it&#39;s pockets of armed civilians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you copying and pasting your responses? You&#39;re wrong about Yemen.</p>

<p>This time the push for federal gun control laws after a mass shooting was unsuccessful. It was, however, successful in the past- after a mass shooting.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a response for gun control legislation after every mass shooting. It&#39;s a guaranteed response from the public after a mass shooting. It doesn&#39;t always succeed in getting new gun control laws passed, but it often does- it did in Aurora, it did in Sandy Hook, it did on a national level after Virginia Tech. </p>

<p>Therefore, it is, indisputably, true that mass shootings affect gun control policies in America. </p>

<p>EDIT- notice, also, I have reams of supporting articles from reputable news sources, and you have one from propublica. </p>

<p>The one article you keep citing discusses the year since Sandy Hook and gives a man&#39;s <strong>undocumented opinion</strong> about the change in gun control laws <strong>in that year.</strong> </p>

<p>What about the impact mass shootings have had in years prior, such as the last federal gun control legislation that was passed <strong>due to a mass shooting?</strong> </p>

<p>Are you positing that gun control has become more and more lax in the past fifty years? Of course it hasn&#39;t. Gun control is being restricted more and more, and legislation is demanded after mass shootings. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not an Australian, I can see, because you wouldn&#39;t be spouting all this BS about Australia if you were.</p>

<p>You have some ridiculous idea that Sydneyers were walking around with handguns until the ban, and then suddenly they&#39;re all defenseless and being preyed upon by criminals.</p>

<p><em>This is completely wrong.</em></p>

<p>Australia has always had gun control - there&#39;s no second amendment there (I live in NYC now).  In the cities, gun ownership has always been rare, and carrying has always been extremely rare. </p>

<p>Moreover, there isn&#39;t any sort of crime wave going on in Sydney.  Sydney is a safe city - there are rough neighborhoods, sure, but nothing like in, say, DC or LA.</p>

<p>So please <em>stop</em> using Australia as some sort of example of your theories, &#39;cause it&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not saying that Australia is a bad place, nor Sydney. My point was just that the gun control push after the Port Arthur massacre was not nearly as effective as everyone from outside Australia tries to make it seem. Gun violence continues to be a problem, and Sydney seems to be a hotspot compared to the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Nearly every time gun control gets brought up, Australia is mentioned as if it&#39;s the shining star of the world and great example of what gun control can accomplish. Simply put, the results were not that dramatic at all and it was already on the decline. Not to mention suicides were also factored into gun-violence, which skewed the stats.</p>

<p>My theory is very simple and Thomas Jefferson put it best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in response to your question about what it achieves? I agree that gun control would be a failure as the goal, because it was as of yet ineffective. But where it was effective was in the level of fear it gave people... They LOCKED DOWN boston after the marathon bombing in order to find an UNARMED teen, and while doing so stripped people of guns and drugs in UNLAWFUL search and seizure. This, in my opinion, is a direct result of the increased fears of young men with guns.</p>

<p>Also, I noticed that with every school shooting, mall shooting, public shootings in general, that we&#39;re seeing heavily armed police forces more and more prominently. So I don&#39;t think the agenda is simply to take guns from people, I think it&#39;s to make it so people feel comfortable letting their police force become an army.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m with you there to an extent. I&#39;m firmly against the militarization of police. However I personally disagree as to why it&#39;s happening. I don&#39;t see the bad things that happen such as Sandy Hook as faked to that end. Regular people do bad things, even on that scale. I think there are multiple reasons for police becoming more militarized, part of which has to do with public perception of the danger to their person. But I don&#39;t think Sandy Hook contributed as much to that, as, say, the Boston bombing you mention. In fact it had quite the opposite effect for a lot of people, who think see this as a further reason to always be armed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree, but why do you think there&#39;s been so much confusion and concealment in this case? I&#39;ve entertained the idea that it&#39;s as they say and I still can&#39;t understand why I haven&#39;t seen a shot of Adam Lanza like I did the two guys in the Boston Marathon bombings. Although I have wondered if maybe the police shot and killed him, and in the process possibly injured or killed a few of the victims. No conspiracy really, just incredible misconduct that involves children and therefore must be kept quiet? I hate not having enough facts to build a concrete understanding of what happened. Anyway, let me know what you think, it&#39;s always interesting to hear why someone thinks there&#39;s no conspiracy and I&#39;m interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, where is the bar set for confusion in a case? Given that law and that the CT AG took special steps to safeguard the privacy of the families, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really any concealment with the case going on. The news media <em>always</em> gets things wrong with tragedies like this. There is no time to prepare, and it&#39;s kind of disgusting but they <em>are</em> concerned with being the first to out some tidbit of news.</p>

<p>As far as why there are images of the Boston bombers, I think that probably had something to do with it being a public event and the ensuing manhunt. I guess, in brief, my qualms here are with the conspiracy theories people are proposing and the sense of entitlement they have to photographic or video evidence. The only reason there are people asking &quot;where are the images&quot; is because people are convinced that their guns are going to be taken away and they want proof that something this terrible could occur. There&#39;s only a handful of new gun laws - almost all in pretty liberal states with harsh gun control already - since the shooting that actually ban(and confiscate) certain types of guns. Conversely almost twice the number of changes to the laws actually were loosening the regulations. Noone asked &quot;where is the evidence&quot; and cooked up these awful theories when a man shot dead 67 people, mostly teenagers, on an island in Norway - because they weren&#39;t concerned it would be used as political fuel to impact their &quot;right&quot; to own guns.</p>

It&#39;s a wealthy state(the gap in the income of its residents is one of the largest however) and it unites New England and NYC(tristate area). I know after the shooting happened that it shook New England to the core, because we all saw CT as so safe and it failed in that regard. That means it could happen to anyone, even us. So if it was a false flag, the bombing that followed months later that caused a lockdown would make the choice of CT masterful. Because now we know that terror gives the police unbridled control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give an answer, but it&#39;s worthless because I&#39;m pretty sure the military could handle ragtag groups of civilians if that was the goal. Despite our losses, they don&#39;t seem to be having much trouble in Afghanistan - the populace of which not only has experience fighting an invading organized military but is better armed and has even more inhospitable terrain to their advantage. We&#39;ve utterly dominated the country and decimated the insurgency. It&#39;s barely a fraction of what it was shortly after the invasion.</p>

<p>The answer is yes. Of course it would be! My question is, <em>do you foresee that coming?</em> Then stock up on guns and ammo to your hearts content. Personally I don&#39;t see the government as frothing at the bit to enact martial law and round everyone up in camps.

<p>Okay, it sounded like you were implying that 20 children were killed so that the government can justify taking everyone&#39;s guns so that they&#39;re powerless to stop martial law and barcodes and concentration camps and whatever other evil shit. My mistake.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I&#39;m not for many of the proposed gun control regulations. There are a few that are worth looking into IMO, but things like magazine limits and limiting certain types of weapons(mostly based on what they look like) are flawed. Most of the country has a long history of safe use of firearms. I think what you are saying is entirely fair, though personally I don&#39;t mind an additional layer of paperwork if it saves lives(which remains to be seen conclusively).</p>

<p>With the <em>massive</em> kneejerk reaction to 9/11, I&#39;d say so. Do you remember what it was like afterwards? Whether or not you believe <em>that</em> event was staged, the majority of the populace was just peachy with the increased security in the years following it. I think there is a silver lining to the cloud, however:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The NSA revelations have sparked a strong national dialogue on government overreach in the name of preventing &quot;terrorism&quot;.

<li><p>Following sandy hook we&#39;ve seen some promising discourse that <em>rejects</em> kneejerk reactionary legislation. See the states that did not change or actually loosened their gun regulations(the majority of the country).</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>This has also reginited interest in whether or not the methods of preventing &quot;terrorism&quot; are actually fueling the fire more than snuffing it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To address your other question, if 9/11 <em>wasn&#39;t</em> staged, which certainly the vast majority of the country and the military thinks it was not, then why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> snooping be one of the facets of preventing it from occurring again? It just logically follows, doesn&#39;t matter if we approve of it.</p>

<p>However, do I think NSA spying is good? No, it has undermined international confidence in our mutual respect(though it should be noted that every developed country spies on every other one and that&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t such a shocker to most other developed nations&#39; governments). It has hurt our technology industry already, but we&#39;ve only seen the tip of the iceberg there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t want anyone to harass the families, given what most of the families went through when people started grasping at straws, connecting imaginary dots, and arrived at the conclusion that they are all fake crisis actors. People did some really sick things to the victims&#39; families because they truly believed they&#39;re not real. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read from the documents there is more than enough information to debunk most of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories though, so that probably explains why we&#39;re hearing nothing from the usual sources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man running into the woods was a father trying to get his child. There are numerous articles stating this. I can&#39;t answer why Mr. Parker was laughing.

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why I never bring up any of the shit you mentioned is because it is totally unrelated, often fabricated, and is evidence of nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why were there at least 4 different gun reports all different</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frantic news media in a rush to break the story first. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did he do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one knows</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is Christopher Rodia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A man who was given a citation in Greenwich for a parking violation when the massacre began. Again, this is what I mean by &quot;evidence of nothing.&quot; Someone heard his licence plate being read on Greenwich PD&#39;s police scanner while Newtown was happening, therefore he&#39;s part of a conspiracy. The frequency his name was mentioned on wasn&#39;t even the Newtown Police&#39;s frequency, it was Greenwich&#39;s. RadioReference and other websites that operate SDRs group multiple police department&#39;s frequencies together. That report came in from GREENWICH&#39;s police frequency, NOT Newtown&#39;s. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who was the guy caught on camera running into the woods?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Father picking up his kid</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did no one that didn&#39;t get shot see him? Was he some kind of master marksman?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No idea what this is even supposed to mean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did we only see one small group of kids coming out of the buildings? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the rest were hiding from a gunman and/or evacuated before the news trucks got there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where was all the chaos?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>News cameras weren&#39;t sitting in the parking lot waiting for this to happen. Also training, drills, and knowing what to do reduces chaos in real emergencies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Robbie Parker or whatever his name is laugh and smile before giving a speech about his daughters death on the same fucking day?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grief. Shock. This is where the &quot;crisis actor&quot; shit falls apart. People who have zero understanding of psychology and the grief process go into these videos with a flawed understanding of human behavior in times like this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did they report that his mother was a school teacher when she wasn&#39;t? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>News media rushing to be the first to break the news, as has been mentioned several times. The problem with using inconsistencies in media reporting as evidence of a conspiracy is that you assume everything the media says is 100% factual in the first place. Guess what, they&#39;re a business, and they frequently report incorrect information during crisis situations in the rush to be the first ones to report it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why were first responders told not to go in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there was an active shooter inside. If you&#39;re a paramedic you&#39;re not going to run into a building with an active shooter inside.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could go on and on and I&#39;m sure you will &quot;debunk&quot; some of that but I have never seen every one of those things explained or debunked with any kind of factual information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s probably because you reject the logical factual information you&#39;re given, and most of the points you mentioned are flawed, incorrect, or fabricated. You&#39;re so hellbent on truly believing Newtown was a conspiracy that you&#39;re incapable of thinking about anything for yourself, you let these alternative news blogs shove misinformation down your throat and don&#39;t even question it. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t explain why there were NEVER ANY PICTURES OF THEM COMING OUT only that ONE picture of a TINY group of kids. Just because they were hiding at one point in time does not make it impossible for them to walk out of the door and for a news reporter to take a picture of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, i&#39;m a highly-paid shill, but the report that she was a teacher came from her neighbors. It only reveals how little they knew of her because she was simply a part-time volunteer. There was a ton of inaccurate info that cane from neighbors and Lanza&#39;s classmates because they could be contacted immediately by reporters. The truth is the Lanzas were intensely private, which no one seems to dispute. So the reporters talked to people who didn&#39;t know them at all and ran with it.
The thing is all this early bad reports are paraded around here as evidence of...what, I don&#39;t know, the &quot;real&quot; story leaking out?

<p>Okay so why haven&#39;t we seen one picture of Adam inside the school? Why were there at least 4 different gun reports all different? Why did he do it? Who is Christopher Rodia? Who was the guy caught on camera running into the woods? Why did no one that didn&#39;t get shot see him? Was he some kind of master marksman? Why did we only see one small group of kids coming out of the buildings? Where was all the chaos? Why did Robbie Parker or whatever his name is laugh and smile before giving a speech about his daughters death on the same fucking day? How did he get in the school? Why did they report that his mother was a school teacher when she wasn&#39;t? Why were first responders told not to go in?

    <div class="md"><p>Of course parents saw the bodies of the children. They didn&#39;t let the parents run into the school to hold the bloodied bodies in their arms, of course.  They removed the bodies from the scenes and immediately had them examined so that they could be given to the parents for funerals. Considering that several of those funerals were extremely high profile affairs (receiving national news coverage), you have to be pretty ignorant of what transpired since the shooting to claim parents never saw the bodies.</p>

<p>As to why we don&#39;t post bodies of dead children on the internet, it&#39;s done, when possible, to protect their families from having people use those photos in unsavory ways.  Considering there is zero public value to releasing such photos, withholding them when possible makes sense to me.  In any case, if there were thousands of people (fire fighters, police officers, FBI agents, ATF agents, emt responders, emergency room staff, medical examiner staff, school employees, teachers, children, their parents, extended families, etc.) all faking this event, I doubt it would have been hard to just fake photos  and release them.  In the shadow of such a huge and complicated conspiracy, it seems the photos, released by the same officials you are accusing of playing a role within the conspiracy, should not prove anything to you at all.</p>

<p>Edit: if you do not know who Chris Rhodia is, then that just shows that you don&#39;t care at all about the hard evidence.  The emergency responder audio where he is mentioned has been publicly available for over a year.  Why haven&#39;t you listened to it?</p>

<p>There is no value in truth and transparency? 26 and 2 was the kill to injury ratio. One of those injured was from a ricochet and the other is unidentified as is the nature of their wounding. For all intents an purposes... this event looks like it was done by a trained and conditioned individual. The wound pattern on the kids bodies could clear that up.</p>

<p>156/26=6
6 rounds per kill is about what I was doing in Iraq... as a trained airborne infantryman in close quarters. We also have to subtract for the 6 rounds fired to breech, the ones fired seemingly randomly into cars in the parking lot, and the suicide round. Ill bet it was more like 4 rounds per kill of the ones the shooter actually aimed for.</p>

<p>You probably dont have a clear understanding of what a trained and untrained shooter are capable of. Again, COMPARE IT TO OTHERS. Anders had over an HOUR to rampage on an isolated island and still killed less than he injuredand those kids didn&#39;t fight back. Cho WENT BACK to classrooms he had already slaughtered in, continued rampaging and STILL killed less than he injured in TWICE the time that Lanza did his work. Lanza, in 5 minutes, HITS EVERYONE HE SHOOTS AT KILLING ALL BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO KILL INCLUDING MANY LARGE HEALTHY ADULTS IN A LOCATION WELL KNOWN TO THOSE ADULTS.</p>

<p>ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS.</p>

<p>Lanza&#39;s attack was differents because he planned it to be different. He studied all the other attacks you mention (and others) and made improvements to ensure maximum fatalities.  The biggest of those improvements was he decided to target six year olds in their school rooms.  None of the other shooters you mentioned did that.  And, after firing 156 rounds of semiautomatic fire into groups of those six year olds, his plan proved successful.</p>

<p>Re Cho, yes, adults are far harder to kill than children.  Not just because adults had more attuned self preservation skills and instincts, but because their bodies can survive far more trauma.  Cho still managed to kill more people than Lanza, despite targeting adults and using far less powerful weapons, due to the amount of time he had to revisit rooms.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH its a .22 cal vs a .30 cal. Also, kenetic energy transference is a big deal. If you can get the bullet to stop INSIDE a person then you transfer all the energy of the bullet into them... THIS IS WHAT HOLLOW POINTS DO. .223 FMJ is gonna be ripping through, leaving ice pick sized holes and not transferring much energy where as 9mm Hollow Point will be like shoving nickles into a persons chest at slightly above the speed of sound and then dumping ALL that energy in there.</p>

<p>You obviously don&#39;t know much about guns and it&#39;s cut that you think you do. I&#39;ve actually done this, kiddo...

    <div class="md"><p>Re the weapons, yes, hollow points can transfer more energy.  But, again, you are ignoring the context: the targets for the attack were six year olds bundled tightly in groups and shot at close range.  Having just one &quot;ice pick&quot; thick hole torn through a body is much more likely to kill a six year old than it would be an adult.  Your anecdotes from your time in Iraq are not medical observations.  It is well known that a gunshot wound to a child is far more likely to be fatal than a gunshot would to an adult.  There is no comparing the two as you have so ineptly tried over and over.  (<a href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8301">http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8301</a>)  For Lanza&#39;s purposes, having the rounds stop in the first child struck would have been counter productive.  He was shooting into a group of children, mostly huddled together.  The rifle shots could have easily gone through multiple children, inflicting far more damage than a hollow point and ensuring the &quot;high kill&quot; number you find so puzzling. (Or are you just talking about the adults again, because you keep changing it every other post?)  In any case, I already explained the death of the adults and you had nothing to say about it.  In general, more powerful gun = much more damage in the context of Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Returning to the &quot;insanely high&quot; kill rate--you cannot even begin to articulate a reason why, given the events outlined in the report, only a professional could have achieved it.  But, ah, you recognize that, don&#39;t you?  So now you are just trying to casually dismiss the report (which it is still glaringly obvious you have not read--so what are you basing your &quot;professional&quot; opinion on, again?) for lack of pictures.  If you read at the level of a 1st grader and need pictures to help you, then I feel sorry for you.  But, if you actually read the report, you&#39;d realize that there are many pictures in it.  And where the pictures are redacted according to CT state law, they include extremely detailed descriptions of their contents.</p>

<p>And the report is the joint work of multiple law enforcement agencies and was created with the testimony of over a hundred witnesses and dozens of experts.  There will never be a more definitive and thorough account of what happened in that school.  If it contradicts some other report (which you have not even cited), then that other report is wrong.  And, another by the way, the report includes ALL of the various police reports made in connection with the incident, from the moment it happened until the investigation was completed.  There are hundreds of them.  Go ahead and find your coveted contradiction in any of that and you&#39;ll actually have something more than your ignorance and lack of critical thinking to support your theory.</p>

<p>But what does it matter?  You haven&#39;t even read the summary report.  You are just a broken record repeating a baseless (and ever-changing) theory that only someone with professional training could have achieve the number of fatalities that Lanza did.  And all you have to do in order to make it sound good in your head, apparently, is close your eyes and ignore the facts of what actually happened.  You still don&#39;t even seem to see the absurdity of claiming that it is just as hard to kill trapped six-year olds at close distance as to kill adult militants in a war zone.</p>

<p>Six shots per kid, right, hawk eye?  Please tell me you are no longer wasting my tax dollars in the military.</p>

<p>26 and 2 was the kill to injury ratio. </p>

<p>Who cares!?  You&#39;re grasping at straws!</p>

<p>Why is a high kill ratio any sort of evidence of a conspiracy?  FFS, people here seem convinced that Boston was also a false flag - with 3 people killed and 254 injured!</p>

<p>He managed to kill so many because he targeted small children and he shot each one multiple times to make sure that they were dead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all intents an purposes... this event looks like it was done by a trained and conditioned individual. The wound pattern on the kids bodies could clear that up.</p>

<p>Because a &quot;trained and conditioned individual&quot; is going to shoot in some very specific way?  What way would that be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because there is no other event where an untrained individual has had an even similar kill/injury ratio.  Never.  Not one aingle time in history has this been seen.  This tells us that the event is highly abnormal, and as such, suspect.  It must be investigated fully.  We are seeing nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Cho WENT BACK TO CLASSROOMS where he had already shot people, continued his rampage and STILL killed less than he injured. Anders had over an hour on that island to rampage, was on steroids and ephedrine, and had cultivated a aggressive mentality and worked out and trained to a level Lanza didnt even touch.... and he STILL killed less than he injured.</p>

5 bullet holes in and around the exterior wall/window of the special education room. Up-close photos of the area show that at least one of the shots appears to originate from outside the school.

    <div class="md"><p>Funny that you bring up Columbine...That event was over 14 years ago. BEFORE anyone had smart phones. BEFORE HD cameras were prominent..and yet we have more hard evidence of that event than of shootings in the past couple of years. (Sandy Hook and the Aurora Theater shootings specifically) Regarding Columbine, we have VIDEO FOOTAGE of the shooters. We also have 911 calls with guns firing and glass breaking in the background with legitimately frightened sounding people. We know literally everything of that event. Now..Regarding the more recent shootings: There are NO videos of the shooters or pictures showing that the shooter was in fact who the media says it was in the act. The 911 calls from both events are clearly actors and do not sound legitimately frightened at all...Now don&#39;t you think if you saw a group of people get murdered right in front of you that you would be panicking? Isn&#39;t it strange that in an age of HD surveillance and smart phones we have LESS hard evidence of these events than of Columbine?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for your lost but when it comes to Sandy hook related shit on here people seem to go off the deep end for some reason. Hell someone on here even thinks that the town it&#39;s self is fake because they visited one day and couldn&#39;t find a lot of people. </p>

This was the 9/11 for this generation&#39;s small children.  They scared children on a mass scale by slaughtering 20 of them publicly.  When today&#39;s third graders are 18 and up voters, that will be a moment seared into their consciousness.  </p>

<p>Come on man, LEARN HOW IT WORKS.  Its about gradualism, changing society by scarring the young.  Read up on Bolshevism, or Fabianism.  They had to get the kids brainwashed in order to bring about changes that would be much easier to foment with a willing population.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you there to an extent. I&#39;m firmly against the militarization of police. However I personally disagree as to why it&#39;s happening. I don&#39;t see the bad things that happen such as Sandy Hook as faked to that end. Regular people do bad things, even on that scale. I think there are multiple reasons for police becoming more militarized, part of which has to do with public perception of the danger to their person. But I don&#39;t think Sandy Hook contributed as much to that, as, say, the Boston bombing you mention. In fact it had quite the opposite effect for a lot of people, who think see this as a further reason to always be armed.</p>
