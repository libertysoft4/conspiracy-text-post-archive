    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t speak of things you don&#39;t know about. I was on the USS Michigan SSBN 727 blue crew and go my dolfins aboard her on my first patrol.</p>

<p>There are 24 missles aboard in the tubes and each one of them has a ring that can carry 6 warheads each one beiny a thermonuclear device. There is only 3 Geiger counters on that vessel. The only reason they even had them was cause the missle compartment on each of the three levels had one near the forward most part port side on each deck.</p>

<p>The reactor has built in radiological detectors thruout the compartment. Tell me why would they need hand held ones aboard any other vessel other then one that carried nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>This is the only true thing you&#39;ve said.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go ahead and note that you haven&#39;t addressed my &quot;you&#39;re not a nuke&quot; statement and resort solely to insults.  So, I defer to my original statement of &quot;you should teach yourself the same lesson&quot; and not claim to be an expert in radcon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually cracker jack I got out when we were still call mess specialist. Your new navy dont interest me anymore. I myself am convinced you are a sham. You more then likely never spent time aboard a boat. You would also have corrected my post on the ring of a missile. That is if you were ever really aboard a submarine. </p>

<p>It is the only thing you would be unable to find on the internet. You have no credibility in my eyes. I for one will not buy your bullshit. I can only hope that no on else does. </p>

<p>Furthermore in order to get your fish you must know all parts of a boat as well as basic knowledge of everyone&#39;s job. Any true submariner would know this. It is required that you demonstrate damage control procedures for all CIRCUMSTANCES.  Including radiation.  </p>

<p>No perhaps I didnt have the designation of an et or em. I did however get my fish in 79 days upon my first patrol. I by no means had it easy as I was told to qualify so I did. I slept maybe 5 hours a night and spend the rest of the time after my watch getting my qualification card signed. </p>

<p>You on the other hand as an officer are basically given your fish. Little boys club among officers in the fleet all of us enlisted knew this and I am sure they still do. So the fact that I can point out two instances upon where you demonstrated inferior knowledge and didnt correct me proves that you have not ever been aboard a submarine. </p>

<p>So consult wiki again see what you can find and go ahead come back then I will go thru and bash you sk me more. I myself have been out of the navy since 05 but I have more then likely forgotten more then you will ever know from wiki.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen enlisted qual cards and sat enlisted fish boards, but thanks for explaining the process to me.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Since I&#39;ve never been on a boomer, I don&#39;t claim knowledge on things like &quot;the ring of a missile&quot; when I don&#39;t know anything about it (again, please refer to my original comment).  I already addressed your first instance of my &quot;inferior&quot; knowledge regarding who does my laundry.  If I were to correct everything in your posts that needed correcting, I&#39;d still be working on fixing your typos, spelling errors, and grammatical mistakes.  But the fact that you think a cook knows more about submarining than an officer is really cute.</p>

<p>Also, if officers are so dumb and our jobs are so easy, why didn&#39;t you go that path?  It&#39;s really nice to be dumber than the people you&#39;re in charge of while having an easier job and getting paid a lot more.  Hmm.  I&#39;ll sit and ponder that one for a bit.  Getting 5 hours of sleep while not being 3 section must have been nice though.</p>

<p>Anyways, my responses to you end here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold your horses buddy and cut it with the dick-measuring contest. He&#39;s right, and more educated on nuclear power than you are. He, unlike yourself (again, I back up the statement of you being a cook trying to claim radcon knowledge, actually went to nuke school and stood EOOW - unless, of course, he&#39;s the one Logistics Officer on board (if I&#39;m remembering correctly.) There are a plethora of legitimate reasons to have radiacs on a nuclear powered vessel apart from just those with nuclear missiles aboard. </p>

<p>Of course, you&#39;ll probably deny my claim because I&#39;m not a submariner (which is not the overarching subject), in spite of the fact that my boat (the George Washington) was actually hit by the plumes and I actually had to do radcon work (which is the overarching subject). And I&#39;m a nuke. So I actually know a thing or two about what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did, and we know how much radiation there was. Not much. (In relation to how much there could have been). </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying not all of the sailors don&#39;t have issues. One or two might actually have been affected by this. If any of the helicopter aircrew are among the complaints, I&#39;d believe their stories. </p>

<p>But, being in the Navy, I&#39;ve seen my fair share of morons and malingerers, and reading these stories and having been on the George Washington, which was in Japan at the time, I know a fair bit of those making these claims are liars. Notice how none of them are the Nuclear Operators - who actually got a considerable amount as well, if not more, as they actually did a lot of the radcon work with the ventilation, which was rather &quot;hot&quot; at the time, hotter than what anyone else dealt with - except for the aircrew.</p>

Seriously? You believed that?
&quot;Sound powered phones.&quot; Sound. Powered. Phones.
Sound. Powered.
Sound.
They don&#39;t have batteries.
They have AMPLIFIERS which are units which are by no means required for their operation - merely nice to have - but they&#39;re powered off of the electrical distribution system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um seriously? Fine electronics should always be affected more than cheap electronics when it comes to radiation. Today&#39;s commercial radiation measuring equipment is stopped dead by cell phones but the stoneage equipment from the 1940s will always work. The littlest amount of radiation affects today&#39;s equipment significantly compared to older items without fine electronics.</p>

<p>It much more likely that a bunch of sailors bought cheap ass watches at the same time at the bx before they shipped out so the said watches crapped out at the same time.</p>

<p>Go ahead and believe what you want, but don&#39;t go around calling other people stupid when you clearly have no idea how radiation works.</p>

<p>Edit: I can guarantee the dose was less than 300mrem at the ship because if it were even remotely that high the dose would have been lethal on land.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit story is bullshit.  At that distance the only radiation they would be getting is from gamma rays. and since gamma rays are non-ionizing that wouldn&#39;t stop a watch.  Alpha and beta rays wouldn&#39;t make it through the cases.</p>

<p>Besides, just about piece of equipment on the bridge of that ship is digital.  No reports of anything else stopping.</p>

<p>Did I remember to say this bullshit story is bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er, gamma rays <em>are</em> ionizing.  You have to be a bit cautious in your terminology, because particle physicists tend to call <em>any</em> photon a &quot;gamma&quot;, but generally any photon over about 10 eV (shorter than 124 nm) is considered &quot;ionizing&quot;, at least for biological purposes.  (C-C bond is 5 eV, O-H bond is 14 eV).</p>

<p>It needs to be significantly higher energy to get through a watch case, of course.</p>

<p>That said, I agree that it&#39;s bullshit.  the levels a few miles offshore from Fukushima would not be <em>nearly</em> enough to have this effect.  </p>
