    <div class="md"><p>What you will hear depends very much on who you are listening to. There are people in the industry who will assure you everything is fine, but they are lying. TEPCO are a two bit electricity generating company on the verge of bankruptcy. They never were experts at nuclear decontamination and they don&#39;t have the money or expertise to clean up their site at Fukushima. If they get any part of the fuel rod removal process wrong it could cause another nuclear incident (three reactors have already melted down) but this time as a nuclear explosion. How big a nuclear explosion? Nobody knows. There has never been a nuclear incident involving hundreds of tons of plutonium and uranium. Some scientists speculate that enough hydrogen would be produced by water breaking down in the first microseconds of a runaway reaction to create a thermonuclear explosion that would leave a hole where northern Japan used to be. Others suggest that the enormous burst of neutrons coming from a Fukushima explosion could set off explosions in the other nuclear reactors up and down Japan&#39;s coast in a giant chain reaction. Bear in mind that the rods they are removing at the moment are from a building which has not been severely irradiated. The spare fuel rods in the other three reactor buildings have to be removed as well eventually and they are all currently sitting in a nuclear furnace which is too radioactive to even send robot cameras into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fuel rod removal from Reactor 4 is obviously urgent and critical. The water tank holding the rods is 90 feet up in the air in a building that is severely structurally damaged and will almost certainly collapse with the next earthquake. If the rods break up the fuel pellets they contain will accumulate until they reach criticality and then explode. In any case, the loss of coolant will mean they catch fire. Either scenario will lift tons of radioactive material into the atmosphere – notably caesium and plutonium. There will be no escape.</p>

<p>But removing the fuel rods from Reactor 4 is a walk in the park compared to what faces the engineers in buildings 1, 2 and 3. Those buildings are too radioactive to get into and engineers have no idea how they will remove the fuel rods from them and deal with the molten reactor cores. The truth is that the current operation, while vital, is little more than a PR exercise compared to what needs to happen in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are very quiet about it, but they have their own engineers on-site 24/7 even though they&#39;re not part of the official management team. GE have avoided taking direct blame so far even though it was their crappy design which led to the power failures and the meltdowns and the hydrogen explosions. But when Americans start dying they are going to want a bigger fish to fry than little TEPCO who will go bankrupt at the blink of a lawsuit. I imagine the GE board are crapping themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know that. I don&#39;t know squat. Nobody does. Even professional nuclear engineers admit they cannot predict what will happen. All anybody can do is try to imagine what the worst and best case scenarios will be, and accept that it will pan out somewhere between the two.</p>

<p>We could get lucky. I doubt that TEPCO can do it on their own, but maybe the engineers will remove all of the used fuel rods successfully from all four reactors and quench the three melted reactor cores, and all before the next earthquake hits. But I doubt it.</p>

<p>Even a small incident – a fuel assembly snapping and dropping fuel pellets back into the rack – could set off a criticality. And when the water boils off the zirconium cladding which holds the fuel rods together will burn and release the fuel pellets that way. This could produce the dirtiest nuclear bomb ever created. It could blast tons of nano sized plutonium particles into the upper atmosphere in the biggest mushroom cloud ever created. Even the cockroaches wouldn&#39;t survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our news is not reporting on this. The Dr.&#39;s and hospitals cannot find an illness. I have had 5 family members in and out of the hospital since early 2012. All are over 60. One family member died of cancer 3 months ago and that came on suddenly and fast. She was over 80 with no prior health problems. Lots of miscarriage and still born babies. Here is a list of ongoing &quot;unexplained&quot; illness our family and friends have: thyroid disorder, extremely high white blood cell count, leukopenia in quarentine, pissing and shitting blood, coughing up blood, lung infection, pneumonia, large growth like cyst in throat, bleeding lesions in the stomach, cronic sinus problems, severe diarrhea, heart attack like symptoms 3 family members in the hospital for this in the past 8 months, loss of apatite, weight loss, cronic pane, loss of muscle/joint use, and people with elevated calcium levels being tested for cancers. My father in law is going in for leukemia testing after the new years also. This is all sudden illness, in healthy people with no major medical history. I think it&#39;s odd. And alarming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on who you ask.</p>

<p>I know a guy who works in a nuke plant and he assures me we&#39;ll be fine. I like his optimism and try to focus on his projections. Is he overly optimistic? Maybe. Are his views colored by what his company tells him? Obviously. But I like to go with his take on it because it&#39;s less depressing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the doom-sayers will tell you that the planet is dying.</p>

<p>I like to think that the worst case scenario is that kids will die of cancer for the the next couple hundred years. Children of Men style. As a species we&#39;ll live and the planet might get cancer, but it won&#39;t die. We&#39;re just going to have to get through a couple really nasty decades. Or centuries. Remember that Chernobyl still has wildlife flourishing out there. The young-ins will survive and they&#39;ll be hyper-strong. But they also may have a shorter life-span. I don&#39;t know as much about Chernobyl as I could. But that place isn&#39;t a parking lot. So there&#39;s hope for the planet.</p>

<p>All of that said - learn about radiation sickness and how to deal with it. Lemon tea, hard greens and so on. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll likely be fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d definitely avoid the seafood. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2011, we imported about 91 percent of the seafood consumed here in the United States. However, a small portion of these imports were caught by American fishermen, exported overseas for processing and then re-imported to the United States. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I were an unscrupulous owner of a fishing company I&#39;d be finding ways to export my tainted catches anyway possible in order to recoup my losses. You all really think a company is just going to dump its catch it spent ridiculous amounts of man hours and money to acquire because of a little radiation? </p>

<p>Fuck that, I&#39;m going to sneak it into anything I can, and probably right into your cat&#39;s food. And you&#39;ll wonder why little Fluffy is riddled with cancer when you take him to the vet for his checkup after noticing uncontrollable bloody vomit and diarrhea. In the meantime, I&#39;ll be laughing my way to the bank.</p>
