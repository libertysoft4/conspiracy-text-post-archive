        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just simply wish to obtain a broader view of opinions about 9/11 from your perspective. Do you believe the official story? Do you have some doubts? </p>

<p>My theory is there&#39;s a higher percentage of people outside the U.S. who actually have more doubts with what really happened that day. I base this off of the fact that, in my opinion, most of us Americans hold a view about the tragic event that is one-sided. People whom I have spoken with regarding this topic really have trouble postulating on the the fact the official story told may have indeed been different, or possibly fiction. When you look at people everywhere, it&#39;s hard for them to question certain things they&#39;ve been taught or have been subjected to while growing up. This in turn closes the box more, and more, thus keeping people from attempting to open it. I also believe the mainstream media have more of a strangle hold on the American public.</p>

<p>So please, take this seriously and voice your honest opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dutch here. I was 10 when it happend.</p>

<p>Playing on my SNES when mom comes stroming in and switches to the news.</p>

<p>I couldnt grasp what happend at that moment. I had no clue what this ment. Recognized it was a big thing but it went all passed me back then.</p>

<p>Fast forward 6 years. See zeitgeist. Yes i know it was full of fallacies but it made me take the step to look for more information. Ofcourse after that many years had passed and the consequences of the attack were clearly visible to me. America is setting up base im the middel East. </p>

<p>(Fun fact: check <a href="http://WWW.empire.is">this</a>; it&#39;s a map of all the american military bases around the world. Russia is surrounded.)</p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t know what happened but to me, at the very least, the government knew what was going to happen, and let it happen. Worst case scenario, they planned the whole thing and it was a complete &#39;inside job&#39;.</p>

<p>The story is full of holes. And we will probably won&#39;t find out the truth. That being said, I hope enough people awoke in the last 12 years. Its obvious something&#39;s fishy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was walking home from school and my dad was driving past, he stopped the car and said &quot;Two planes hit the world trade centre in New York&quot;, he was off to work so he had to drive on.</p>

<p>I was young, I didn&#39;t know what the world trade centre was; regardless I sat and watched the news along with everyone else, following the story develop and really taking it as it came at me.</p>

<p>A few years later I started to realise that some things in life weren&#39;t quite what they seemed; the war on drugs, the religion I had been brought up, and I started to make my own choices about these things rather than being told what to believe.</p>

<p>I watched &#39;9/11: Lose Change&#39; when it hit the web, and Fahrenheit 9/11 shortly after. I guess that was when I disregarded everything that was pumped into me on 9/11 and looked at the facts/evidence myself to make up my decision - something I continue to do.</p>

<p>One thing chills me still to this day; when I was watching the non stop 9/11 coverage I remember seeing footage of NYC closed off with dump trucks removing just about every piece of debris they could. I mean endless dump trucks, working non stop for days.. And even at the time I couldn&#39;t quite piece together why they were in such a rush to get rid of everything.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a bomb go off destroying a street, and the wreckage caused wasn&#39;t cleaned up or removed for days, maybe weeks while investigations went on. After all it was a crime scene.</p>

<p>Also I guess as someone living outside the US I have the privilege to &#39;look in&#39; and see just how sensationalised and hysterical the US Media is. I&#39;ve seen CNN reporters go off &#39;commenting&#39; on the news without any real evidence to back up what they claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t figure out why debris was cleared as quickly as they could? There were many reasons for this fast clean-up. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find survivors. Believe it or don&#39;t, people can survive a building collapse. </p></li>
<li><p>Get the subway running smoothly again. There was a huge disruption in power distribution and damage to a station or two. </p></li>
<li><p>It really was a huge job cleaning up. What did you expect the city to do besides allocate all resources to getting a large pile of steel and glass out of a busy city?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, you know &quot;Loose Change&quot; was debunked, right? The two creators are just college students who would ask vague questions and then answer their own questions with pseudoscience and lies. Editors from <em>Popular Mechanics</em> absolutely destroy them on an episode of &quot;Democracy Now&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s important to note, I didn&#39;t say that I instantly believed everything I had seen in &#39;9/11 Loose Change&#39; or &#39;Fahrenheit 9/11&#39; but in both cases the information being presented was actually more convincing than the official story being presented by the US Government.</p>

<p>THAT was enough for me to strip back what I had been told, and I started again by my own accord to decide for myself what happened that day.</p>

<p>Once you look at 9/11 with an open mind, it&#39;s easy to see the gaps in the official story. WTC 7 alone is enough to blow the whole thing open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you keep saying that &quot;Loose Change&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was &quot;more convincing&quot;. It&#39;s more convincing because you already have the conclusion in your head. Neither of those movies rely on scientific understanding or any reproducible results to support their claims.

    <div class="md"><p>It doesnt take much to realize there&#39;s something fishy with this event. No one is searching for the proof behind the government&#39;s claims, and not to be cliche, but its much easier to direct the steaming anger towards the supposed Arab savages. Smart people are questioning the publicized facts, but as far as taking action? its too late now. </p>

<p>The truth is that the apathy runs so deep that it doesnt matter what anyone thinks (anyone referring to people with food, water, and internet). 9-11 has been referenced, and really ridiculed, in movies, video games, books, and tv shows. This shows us that America and the rest of the world takes it as a joke. The real joke is that this event - in which a sane thinking person would be abysmally uncertain of who the culprits are - has been used as a means to go to war where millions perished.        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply have always doubted 9/11. 
My first reason is because the power in the surrounding areas as far as I know, to atleast Long Island was knocked out along with the phone line for 3 days.
Another important fact I have always remembered is that the lights also flicked several minutes before this. I know this because my grandmother was teaching class that day at an inner city school near NYC. 
These certain points always stuck with me because it was a huge topic of interest while I was growing up. We would visit NYC every summer, and this year that the event occurred I didn&#39;t travel with my parents. 
So it must have been something larger, is what I have concluded. These are just peices of the puzzle, if anyone else has information like this it would definitely help in piecing it all together.</p>
