I have always had a strong distrust of authority but with the inconsistencies in the Boston narrative I started my trip down the rabbit hole. I read as much as I can and I try to make sense of it all. I am skeptical of everything. There are so many sensationalists in the conspiracy world. It seems like 90% of the time I research the background of an article I find that they left something important out or wrote the whole article about one sentence in a document. Is there a source for real unbiased information? I feel like I can&#39;t trust either side. My solution for now is to slowly work my way out of the system and try to do the best I can for my family. I file all the potential disinfo in my brain away and try to connect the dots as I see them. Sometimes my isolationist strategy feels like a cop out. I should be more involved in finding and spreading the truth. I would love to hear any opinions or personal stories of your journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is something called controlled opposition.   The controlled opposition rarely, if ever discuss the Black Pope and the Jesuits.  This is a red flag in my eyes.  No one discusses the Jesuits but they are very very high on the pyramid.   </p>

<p>Controlled opposition is likened to fire authorities lighting a controlled fire to prevent a massive wild fire.  I know I&#39;ll get a lot of downvotes for slamming alex jones but the man is controlled opposition.   What Good does he do?  He keeps most &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; locked into one stage of the awakening process and goes on national tv outlets and acts like a moron discredditing the truth movement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with the Black Pope or Jesuits but I will take a look. </p>

<p>As far as Jones goes I am skeptical of him but I have learned a lot from his guests. Even if he is controlled he is out there and he gets people to look. The people that get stuck with him would be useless to the truth movement anyways. 75% of his callers disgust me. In my opinion his approach is all wrong and he discredits himself but at least he gets attention. You can&#39;t say that for many others. I would like to think other open minded people like myself can listen to him, take things with a grain of salt and do their own research. The only problem is that the research is where I get frustrated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What research problems are you running into specifically?   </p>

<p>My main probablem with Jones is his presentation with his wildness and staying on the surface rather than go deeper.  I do see where he is somewhat helpful but people tend to get stuck just listening to him and researching what he tells them too.  </p>

<p>Yes, the Jesuits and their control system is very interesting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know... I completely understand your sentiment here. But strange as it is, I was watching an interview with Karen Hudes(sp?) who I realize is, on occasion, a bit mentally frenetic. Nonetheless, she is a very smart woman.</p>

<p>The interviewer was a woman who had some low-level conspiracy site...and this interview took place back in April.  And while Karen is going on about our government and the crooks within, she did mention that if was larger than just the &quot;banksters&quot;. Pressed by the interviewer as to what she meant, she paused, and then said &quot;well, you have to look at the Vatican...specifically, the Jesuits...But I can&#39;t say anything else...&quot; She actually looked nervous that she did say to much already.</p>

<p>I was perplexed...This seemed along the lines of UFOs and alien anal probes to me...But I never forgot it. I did look around the web for this in other stories and it&#39;s rare...But when you find it, it is compelling. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know....But my ears are open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is a really smart man.  I think his antics are a form of controlled opposition.  When he goes on Piers Morgan and acts like an idiot, I believe its on purpose and the to make it hard to look at the facts he&#39;s spewing and more on the antics.  </p>

<p>And he never mentions the Jesuits because that&#39;s who is controlling him..</p>

<p>Controlled opposition at its finest.  Give you a burn but control it so it doesn&#39;t get too wild.  </p>

<p>And his followers will defend him up and down.  Does he ever mention the contol system of religion like Falvius josephus writing the new testament?  He is controlled.  He is controlling the revolution from getting to wild.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I woke up about 7 years ago and I got crazy for a while.  I gained a ton of weight out of depression and then woke up even more and lost all the weight and more. I got fit both mentally and physically.  </p>

<p>Best advice I can give ya: take care of your self, physically ,mentally, and spiritually.  You can spend all your waking time  researching and only scratch the surface. You can tell people the truth but only a few of them are ever gonna wake up.  Dont get discouraged, get mad and use it to better yourself.   Spread the truth but only in little snippets so people don&#39;t block you out.  Regardless of your spiritual beliefs know that you woke up for a reason,  these things need to play out and in the end, what&#39;s meant to be will be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t completely agree with you but I think you are being real compared to a some of the other respondents.  Thank you for that. I think we could all learn a lot more if we ended petty infighting and came together to share ideas and information. </p>

<p>As far as research goes take global warming ,vaccines or fluoride as an example. I am not a scientist so all I can do is read the work of other people and the opinions of other people and try to formulate my own. When you&#39;re talking about a scientific conspiracy the water gets very muddy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big difference between disinformation and misinformation. I think fellows like Alex Jones probably fall into the misinformed category. It&#39;s like we&#39;re all trying to solve a connect-the-dot puzzle with 7 billion dots...Nobody can put it all together because nobody can possibly possess all the information. Therefore, people are bound to get excited and exclaim that they <em>know</em> what the puzzle picture is, despite having only seen a small section of dots. 
On another note, I feel for you my friend. I recently started investigating the truth as well, due to inconsistencies in the 9/11 explanation. And man, there is such a wealth of information out there, both true and false, that it really is a full-time job to sift through it all. In fact, I made a list of topics that interest me most (such as international banking, weapons development, current affairs, etc) and I study them in a routine fashion, delving deeply into only one at a time. It helps a little bit, but it&#39;s impossible to maintain a strict sense of organization in such a chaotic and dense subject.
Good luck, and may fortune follow you and yours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to have good judgment, common sense, and an historical perspective. Most people don&#39;t have any one of these qualities, so they are at a loss to know what is real and what is disinformation.</p>

<p>We live in corrupt, perverse, degenerate times, and most people don&#39;t even realize it. When you grow up with a stink in your nostrils every day, you can no longer smell it. But those who are somewhat older remember a time when the corruption was not quite so bad, and the perversion not quite as pervasive.</p>

<p>For a man to protect his family is the best thing that he can do. You can&#39;t change the world, but you can make sure your kids are not complete idiots who believe what the government and the schools tell them.</p>

<p>Most of the conspiracies you read here are total bullshit. And I&#39;m talking about the political conspiracies. The people here really don&#39;t know they are bullshit. They&#39;ve either lost their common sense, or they never had it in the first place. They can&#39;t distinguish the ridiculous from the probable. Don&#39;t believe the government, but also, don&#39;t believe what you read here, either. Use your own judgment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, the information that appears genuine to me is done so tonally.  What I mean by that is it&#39;s just information.  Not editorializing.  Not fear mongering.  Not angry and OMG U WONT BELVE!!!!!!</p>

<p>One of the most frustrating things for me is when I watch a youtube video and a person is making very valid points, but then starts grandstanding &quot;see, it&#39;s just like this, and just like that, and etc, etc&quot;  You&#39;re in an echo chamber at that point, and all you&#39;re going to hear is what you want/expect to hear.  Chances are, you aren&#39;t learning anything, just confirming biases.  Be mindful of that.</p>

<p>A lot also has to do with what information you&#39;re specifically looking for.  Some things are &#39;old news&#39; so to speak (something like FED being a private corporation not under gov&#39;t control), to which everyone from respectable historians and educators to eleven year old sociopaths have a comment about somewhere.  It could be arm-chair-scientist concerned with puffs of air in 9/11 demolition footage.  You really have to look at your source, or the very least, where the information you&#39;re reading comes from.  Sadly, you&#39;re right.  A lot of times information will be specifically left out, or a lot is supposedly &#39;gleamed&#39; from just a sentence or two from some document in 1883.  That&#39;s where it&#39;s up to you to sit down with that document and read all of it, take notes and try to find answers.  If you cant find those answers, ask some more questions.  Plenty of forums and places to go to.  Just be weary of the answers and don&#39;t accept anything at all at face value.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been chasing rabbits for close to a decade.  9/11 was my catalyst.  The narrative didn&#39;t sit right, so I started reading some things.  At first it was months of 8-10 hrs per night reading and reading and watching videos and blowing my world view on its literal ass.  But I noticed an odd trend through the places I was getting my information- they were all very angry.  Rightly so, don&#39;t get me wrong.  But that anger was unsettling to me.  This may have to do with coming across some very intriguing &quot;spiritually good&quot; information very early in my research (to this day I still don&#39;t really have a way to describe it.  Research the Hidden_Hand and Law of One quite fascinating and honestly surprising there isn&#39;t a sub devoted to discussing it).  Back on point, as I came to further understand- The whole &quot;machine&quot; is designed to divide humanity.  That anger does nothing but divide us further and serves ulterior motives to the truth.  Not to say all the angry rants I&#39;ve read are disingenuous or are feeding disinformation or misinformation, anger is an excellent motivator.  It just happens to be an excellent divider as well and as such personally turns me off (see Alex Jones).</p>

<p>Another post mentioned Karen Hudes.  While I believe her message, ultimately she&#39;s just confirming things that have been known for a LONG time- with some salt &amp; pepper added here or there for flavor.  That&#39;s all her role is.  She knows more and I truly believes she wants to say more.  But under the contract through which she is currently working, she can not.  But she confirms, in my eyes, some very interesting things regarding the Vatican control of finances.  But I&#39;ve gone off your topic again and I apologize.</p>

<p>Once I was way down the rabbit hole, I realized there&#39;s not really more Truth I can learn- sure I can get closer to actual names and individuals, but to what end?  What good does it do me to know the name of my enslaver?  I still have no power over them.  The game is rigged against me and the only choice I have is to either keep playing or put down the dice.  I did my best to better myself.  Learned useful skills: tracking, trapping, farming, ancient native skills to basic survival.  Ultimately it led me to unplugging from my life, taking off and secluding myself in the wilds for a year.  &quot;Fuck it, i&#39;m not gonna be a part of your system!&quot; I said and I did.  I fled the country and declared my personal emancipation from the game.  I tried to find like-minded people wiling to commit, and a lot of people were.  But as the days turned into weeks into months the numbers started to fall.  It was too much &#39;work&#39; to farm, hunt and live simply.  The few of us that remained were discovered by authorities, our compound destroyed and property seized.  I&#39;m not sure what happened to the others as they were native to the country.  I was deported back to the states and dragged back into the game.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my story anyway, and my advice to wading through the information presented to you.  A little more advice; hug your SO. Don&#39;t keep them in the dark about what you&#39;re researching.  Research together, or at least combine efforts.  A relationship is very difficult to maintain when one still buys into the game.  When your baby is born, Love that child with every ounce of your being and try to give them the world they deserve, not just the one presented to them.  Good luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, sorry if I&#39;m a bit late on this.</p>

<p>I started out my journey just like you. and yes, I am aware that I may as well be typing this information straight into an NSA server. (hey nsa, suck my dick)
I was struck by 9/11 and all the wars we&#39;ve been compelled to fight since then that I started to look into it. I decided I wouldn&#39;t let any prejudice grip me, that I would find the truth myself. </p>

<p>After all, the worlds greatest superpower is acting on these same events, I figured it would be a walk in the park and at the end would be the conclusion that Osama Bin Laden and Al-Queda was responsible and &#39;murica all the way.</p>

<p>Boy was I wrong. I started wondering what I was missing. Everyone seemed so sure it was them, and yet the puzzle pieces never fit.</p>

<p>Needless to say, years later i&#39;m typing on here. </p>

<p>The key is, networks like this, like reddit.</p>

<p>Most of you faggots won&#39;t admit it, and I don&#39;t ever see anyone bring this up on here or on 4chan(yes I browse there, contact me for my lawyers number)
is that networks where people can come together and bring their &quot;dots&quot; that they&#39;ve been &quot;connecting&quot; and share and argue are KEY KEY KEY KEY KEY KEY KEY to defeating whatever entrenched elite/leadership that&#39;s covertly trying to run things.</p>

<p>This is the ultimate tool against them and the only thing we (the people) have to do is to practice sane rationality, critical thinking, and the selfless ego-less sharing of information. </p>

<p>One thing that should alert you is that there isn&#39;t even a consensus among us. </p>

<p>Jesuits, Illuminati, Council on Foreign Relations, Neo-Cons, </p>

<p>jesus we can&#39;t even agree.
this alone is scary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it as a magic trick.</p>

<p>You are in the audience.</p>

<p>The powers that be, through the media, are the Illusionists. </p>

<p>Everything is a trick. </p>

<p>Everything.</p>

<p>But with a bit of perception, you can uncover the trick and sort out whats real and true from whats smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>Whenever you hear a very convincing argument, be it an article on the internet, a video on youtube or just a face to face conversation, make a point of arguing for the other conclusion, or conclusions. The more a video or article persuades you, the harder you are going to need to argue against it. If something is worth worrying about its worth researching, worth thinking about.</p>

<p>No one makes a video or writes and article on a controversial topic merely to inform, even if they mean to. Everyone has an agenda. Ask yourself what they mean to distract you from. What does their side gain?</p>

<p>Things which are to crazy to be true usually are. Our community is flooded with doom prophets and fear peddlers, all telling you of the next dooms day, explaining how when and why the world will end.</p>

<p>All these people are liars. </p>

<p>All their prophecies have been false and will be false. </p>

<p>Instead, seek the truth which is obfuscated by their illusions and the mirages of the corporate media and focus on what they are hiding. </p>

<p>Something is coming. I think thats why people are waking up. To some extent we feel it. Like animals fleeing to the high ground before the earthquake which will birth the tidal wave has even began, we sense that something bad, something very bad, is going to happen.</p>

<p>Soon. </p>

<p>But is soon a year?</p>

<p>Is it ten years?</p>

<p>Is it a day?</p>

<p>None of us know. Many will pretend to know though.</p>

<p>Again, they are liars.</p>

<p>Do what you can to delete yourself from the internet. </p>

<p>Get in shape. Someone busier than you is running right now. Do 10 push-ups after every post. Or not. But get in shape.</p>

<p>Be mentally ready. The times ahead will be frightening and stressful.</p>

<p>Own a gun. Even if you don&#39;t like guns, own a gun. And have ammunition for it. </p>

<p>Do what else you think you need to do to prepare, be it buying food or slowly removing yourself from the world. Deleting your modern footprint as it were. </p>

<p>And remember, everything you see and hear, on here, from your friends, its an illusion. A grand lie told to keep you docile, to keep you asleep. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe it. </p>

<p>The interviewer was a woman who had some low-level conspiracy site...and this interview took place back in April.  And while Karen is going on about our government and the crooks within, she did mention that if was larger than just the &quot;banksters&quot;. Pressed by the interviewer as to what she meant, she paused, and then said &quot;well, you have to look at the Vatican...specifically, the Jesuits...But I can&#39;t say anything else...&quot; She actually looked nervous that she did say to much already.</p>

<p>I was perplexed...This seemed along the lines of UFOs and alien anal probes to me...But I never forgot it. I did look around the web for this in other stories and it&#39;s rare...But when you find it, it is compelling. </p>
