I fail to see the reasons why it&#39;s like impossible to become a moderator, and there are plenty of deserving contributors in here that would be great moderators- yet no mod has the balls or the inclination to remove this tool that pissed <strong>everyone</strong> off and continues to bring nothing to this subreddit. </p>

This truly sounds like the actions of a group of paid shills, trying to turn the public opinion against <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> and thus destroy <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> from the inside-out. So, <a href="/u/ithinkitsatrap">/u/ithinkitsatrap</a>, how long have you been paid by the man? How long have you been suckling on Obama&#39;s teet, trying to destroy an investigative community and make it easier for him to decieve the world? How do you justify your life each time you receive a big &#39;ole check from the government thanking you for corroding the inner strength of this subreddit? Pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why you would want to remain a moderator here. You clearly have most of the sub against you. The fact you haven&#39;t removed yourself shows you don&#39;t care about the sub, the fact you asked a subreddit dedicated to mocking this one how to run this subreddit shows you don&#39;t care, what could you possibly have to gain by continuing to be a moderator?</p>

<p>It is clear you want this for your own personal gain. Quite sad that being a moderator on an internet forum is a highlight for your life, and it clearly has to be since you are so adamant about not relinquishing your power, but please just stop wasting all of our time on this drama with you. You are not important, at all. You are merely a distraction.</p>

<p>By PR type bullshit do you mean speaking as a human being? Because he did little PR type bullshit in my opinion (except one comment that sounded off). He responded as any person being wrongfully persecuted would. And if he&#39;s so holier than thou, why did he go so openly looking for ideas and criticism? He clearly doesn&#39;t have all the answers. Why has there been no large thread discussing conspiratard&#39;s critiques and suggestions? Doesn&#39;t this whole thread and the &#39;he has to go, he has to go!&#39; mob mentality validate those same critiques?</p>

<p>Oh, why do you say this? Doesn&#39;t the fact that he wants to be a better moderator imply that he does care? If you follow the argument that he has a giant ego or a massive e-schlong or something, and that&#39;s why he hasn&#39;t stepped down, why did he make himself the lowest moderator. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of it, his &quot;demoted myself&quot; bone thrown our way was a slap in the face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it a slap in the face, because he didn&#39;t step down if he sees no reason to? Because he refused to step down when he sees no valid arguments for him to do so? He placed himself on the lowest rung. There&#39;s a new call for moderators, and the new one will be placed above him. There, he&#39;s vulnerable, so he just slapped his own face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, he did it to himself. Why is somebody being given the opportunity to discipline themselves in the face of such shit conduct? This speaks volumes to me and is very troubling to say the least.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t even matter. Why the fuck is this troubling? He took the initiative to demote himself; to put himself on the line; to place himself in the hands of the other mods and the incoming mod by his own initiative. I just don&#39;t see why it&#39;s troubling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He also had a great time distancing himself from the tin-foil hat aspect of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when he was at conspiritard. I fucking love my tin-foil hat and our mods should too, or they should find a new place to mod.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah man, that&#39;s respectable. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here. But underneath the tin foil hat lies the hat of reason, and below that the hat of humanity. Let the mods don the tin foil hat as they may. Nobody is taking away your hat.</p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re absolutely correct. I disagree with your assumptions.</p>

A community of 25,000 people doesn&#39;t fall into a bucket like &#39;good&#39; or &#39;evil.&#39; Communities are complex, full of complex people and a variety of demographics. One person doesn&#39;t represent all of them, and the actions of a few do not always represent the actions of the many. I prefer to think critically- handle things on a case by case basis- and then decide.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a baseless accusation, it&#39;s thoughtful speculation. That&#39;s why I say &quot;most likely&quot;. I mean you clearly are somebody&#39;s sockpuppet. And those guys are known for sockpuppeting, witch-hunting, the liberty bot, and for being the most butthurt people when it comes to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> on th whole of reddit. So it seems like a good guess.</p>

<p>If you have any evidence that you&#39;re not a sockpuppet or even an explanation as to why a 26 day old account would be doing this based on 2 non default sub-reddits, I&#39;m happy to read it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s a 100% chance you&#39;re a sockpuppet, like all the other month old accounts who post about conspiratard (lots deleted themselves recently, LeadHelmets was a good example). I am not saying there&#39;s a 100% chance of anything else I have suggested. You just forced me to speculate by refusing to defend yourself but instead go on the offensive.</p>

<p>So yeah I really don&#39;t think it was a baseless accusation, there&#39;s a lot of reasons why you would be a sockpuppet and NLW poster in disguise, but you have so far offered not even 1 explanation as to why you wouldn&#39;t be a sock puppet. </p>

<p>Satire is criticism. The Onion is a prime example of this. It&#39;s a humorous satire newspaper, but it&#39;s also deep social criticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their actions go beyond satire though, as some of the members actively troll here, and harass members here. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that their opinion is ENTIRELY worthless, but my question is, why did you not simply ask US what changes we would want to see in this sub? My impression of this whole debacle is that you seem to think that the echo-chamber is impossible to dismantle, and that we are incapable of self-reflection and skepticism when it comes to our own ideas. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think your action is worth the drama that has seem to erupted in its wake, and I don&#39;t think it NECESSARILY shows your a bad mod, but I still think you should resign, given that the nature of this sub is to remember what people have done, and the trust between you (as a mod) and the userbase has been compromised.  </p>

<p>As far as you can see by the people who are vocal here (many of whom are the hostile type). What you haven&#39;t seen is the myriad of PM&#39;s I&#39;ve gotten from the userbase in support of me.

<p>Sure, but those ones are who are disapproving in a rational/reasonable way are in the minority. Most of the others are bandwagoning/witch hunting.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I don&#39;t think I realized how broken things are here until this happened. The fact that the community here could fill the page up with witch hunts- brigade those threads with downvotes to anyone who is dissenting- and generally become very hostile shows me that are some serious problems with this community. Now that so much of this has been brought to light, I feel invested in helping be a part of the solution. Now don&#39;t take that to mean I want to censor anyone- it means I want to facilitate better rediquette- more reasonable responses from people- less hate- more rational discourse. The ones who can&#39;t abide by the sidebar rules have really come forward in a big way, so I think the sub will improve as they get weeded out. As far as I&#39;m concerned 99% of this could be improved by simply following <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette">reddiquette</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to remain on the high road, as I believe that&#39;s where we&#39;ll all do best.  So I want to be respectful.</p>

<p>As I see it, the problem lies in the fact that you say you want to &quot;talk to your critics&quot;.</p>

<p>Please take this as constructive criticism, or me acting as &quot;Devil&#39;s advocate&quot;, or maybe just trying to explain to you why so many users find this situation so troubling.</p>

<p>You have already stated that you realize much of this is due to the perception that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is &quot;the enemy&quot; of this sub.  For the sake of my argument, please pretend that whether that perception, or the reaction to you interacting with them is appropriate or not is irrelevant.  (I think we could maybe let the whole thing slide, but let&#39;s think about why others might not be down with that)</p>

<p>Why would you ever need to go to /tard to get criticism?  You said most of those you would be getting input from were formerly from this sub (why were they banned in the first place if they&#39;re worthy of conversation?).  At this point, and I&#39;m sure previous to this little incident, you could find plenty of criticism within <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, so why go elsewhere?</p>

<p>The issue that I find within all of this is the fact that in the (informal, mind you) guidelines to modding subreddits, it says your duties are well-defined, to remove spammers and other violators of the rules.  So, what ideas are you seeking on the other sub?  What else are you considering doing, other than your preexisting duties?</p>

<p>Sorry for such a long comment, I just wanted to tell you what I see through my personal lens of interpretation.  At this point, education and harm reduction should be the goal.  This is a fiasco, and whether it is the fault of you the moderator, or if it rather demonstrates some kind of dysfunction within <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s community is sortof irrelevant.  We should try to make it the best subreddit possible, and at this point that goal seems stymied by the resentment toward you.  So, even if it&#39;s unfounded resentment, it must be resolved.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps if you outlined what you learned from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> that would be helpful and then perhaps took a sabbatical/hiaitus to actually let things cool down, it would be best.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read through your comment history, and you seem like a good mod, but the community is soured to you and rejecting you and that&#39;s not healthy.  I really think if you could put the subreddit before yourself it might be best.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, and I don&#39;t mean to sound condescending or anything.  I just wanted to try to sort things out the best I could in the open.</p>

<p>And, I might not be cut out for the job, but I would offer my time to moderate, if that could help at all.  Thanks everybody, and do try to stay on the high road- we want to use ideas, not insults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great comment and really- I wish this was the way everyone else in this sub would pattern their criticisms of ANYthing. Bravo to you for writing things out in such a reasonable way.</p>

<p>There are a number of things I can&#39;t assume to be true. For example- <em>I can&#39;t assume that all members who were banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> were banned justly.</em> The sub has been around for a long time and has changed hands under different mod teams. The second thing I can&#39;t assume is that <em>I can&#39;t assume everyone- or even most members of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are &#39;the enemy&#39; and shouldn&#39;t be listened to.</em> When I talked to them- I got very reasonable responses- and so far every interaction I&#39;ve had with them has been cordial. I&#39;ve seen more problems here within our own ranks. They seem to have their community under control for the most part (even if we don&#39;t agree with their POV- we can admit this). The third thing I think I can&#39;t assume is this: <em>I can&#39;t assume I&#39;m getting the whole story about what is wrong here when there are 25,000 people who seem to have opinions about it elsewhere.</em> Many people here have selection bias when it comes to understanding &#39;what&#39;s wrong.&#39; To be truly scientific about discovering problems and getting recommendations for solutions, we have to be willing to gather data from multiple sources- not just our own back yard. Others who are across the fence, so to speak, can see into our drama and to them it may seem obvious what the problems are. In a lot of ways- it&#39;s like looking at a mirror vs. feeling your face to find dirt. The mirror is an external tool that tells you who you are. That may be an oversimplification, but the idea is there- getting information from a variety of sources helps.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen what people think the biggest problem here is. They think the biggest problem here is <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. Hands down- that&#39;s what gets the most blame. So I went there to get the straight dope.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I have to give a report on what <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> recommended because it&#39;s all right there in the thread. Anyways, I&#39;ll get downvoted to oblivion if I post anything new anyways, so I won&#39;t be able to get past the censorship.</p>

<p>I just want people to think for themselves- and to their credit- <a href="http://imgur.com/hJtqCqc">many in this community have</a>. For the ones who just jumped on the hate bandwagon- hopefully staying strong and sticking to rational discourse will win them over on a better way to communicate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright OP, you need to realize that the posts weren&#39;t maliciously removed but rather fell from view.</p>

<p>I was one of sws&#39;s biggest critics for talking to bipolarbear and suggesting we ban reporting on meta censorship, but at the very least we need to be forthright, correct, and respectable when we present these criticisms. </p>

<p>Whether there is something nefarious going on or not with sws intentions is, in my opinion, still up for consideration.</p>

<p>You also need to realize that the actions of sws don&#39;t represent the actions of the mod team.</p>

<p>Sws may have been in the wrong, perhaps more than once, but we get no where when threads like this are misinformed. </p>

<p>Reddits a fickle beast. Users come and go on not set routine. Most of the sub probably missed this drama. Yes I agree it is important to keep talking about. But not if we&#39;re incorrect in what we&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>It looks like you&#39;re claiming that 1 or two people had six accounts. Whatever.

I&#39;m a quick reader, and thanks to people making &quot;eye-catching&quot; names they tend to stand out like sore thumbs if they keep repeating the same comment with slight variations multiple times in every solidwhetstone thread, and then start their own new threads in which the same six accounts all subsequently comment multiple times <em>again</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, there were undeniably plenty of people saying stuff - they were popular threads. If you stuck the comment frequency on a graph, you&#39;d see a small number of interesting spikes of activity, is all I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>Nothing I&#39;ve said is extraordinary. Anyone else could read those threads in detail, and they&#39;d see what I mean.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/17pnr8/how_dangerous_are_conspiratards/c87sw59">Conspiratards have historically been the most dangerous groups of people on the planet. Notable examples include Nero and Caligula&#39;s genocides, Christian killing of the Jews during the middle ages (ie. Byzantine anti-semitic laws and the mass murder of Jews during the Bubonic Plague), the Armenian genocide, the anti-Semitic Pogroms of the Russian Empire, the Holocaust, Stalin&#39;s purges, the various killings committed by Islamist conspiratard groups and parties such as Boko Haram, Hamas, or Hezbollah, and the list can go on and on. All these groups are united in their belief in, often insane and bizarre, conspiracy theories.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a long time lurker here. I generally don&#39;t partake in comment threads because the audience is quite difficult to speak to outside of their established boundaries (yes, think about that, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll play devil&#39;s advocate here anyway - this sub is generally around 80% unsourced articles and speculative comments. Don&#39;t confuse this with some &quot;free speech&quot; or &quot;free to discuss&quot; censorship you think I may be proposing, if possible, consider that this sub could be of much higher quality and provoke some real discussion if people here would check things before they post - several times I&#39;ve seen the headline not even remotely reflected in the article - and come to the discourse with an open mind, using the downvote button for what it&#39;s made for.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d be happy to see most of the people here create their own sub to discuss wildly unsourced claims and leave the significantly titled sub we&#39;re currently on be more rigourous and academic in its findings and let those of us who lurk in the hopes of finding an interesting story with intelligent discussion use the sub for what it&#39;s made for.</p>

<p>There is a difference between censorship and fact-checking your own submissions, unfortunately this fact is ignored over here.</p>

Iv seen a couple of videos of him on youtube. I personally think he wanted to do good with his post in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> but on the other hand I don&#39;t like any of his suggestions for the sub, I also think he&#39;s a social climber, this guy thrives off of his internet status, he wants to be important.</p>

<p>I rather have mods who are regular chill people, not person&#39;s who identify too much with the &quot;mod&quot; status, just clean up our sub without changing too much. solidwhetstone is all about &quot;advertising&quot;, he uses a lot of PR concepts applied to himself and subs in general. I really don&#39;t like that. He talks about subs as &quot;a brand&quot; for example, that just screams the wrong attitude for me. </p>

<p>He also identifies himself as a redesigner of subs,  he likes to come in and overhaul a sub for his own enjoyment, that&#39;s what I read him say somewhere, he said that he doesn&#39;t do it for the community so much but more for himself, he likes doing it. I just don&#39;t like the guy, there are subs that might benefit from his advertisement style of doing things but this  is not the place for him.</p>

<p>In this context we can clearly see that his last post was a very good PR stunt, he  seemed to have soothed the crowd and yet he maintains his little spot. I&#39;m not saying he thinks his every move through like a chess master, this stuff is just in his blood, it&#39;s who he is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using known social engineering (PR) techniques is not nefarious. That&#39;s just using what you know. </p>

<p>Subs are brands, or they can also be said to represent ideologies or stand for schools of thought. All subreddits are subcultures. So you would have to elaborate why it screams the wrong attitude to you. It&#39;s just words, semantics.</p>

<p>And as to your complain about &quot;redesigner of subs,&quot; why is that a complain? Do you not like cleaning the unclean and cleansing the corrupt? If he does it to boost his ego, so what? Let his ego be his down fall in the long run. If that were to happen, this little witch hunt of no merit proves that if you can (as a sub, not you specifically) bitch about nothing, you can surely complain about something. This sub is in need of tidying up, so let him do it. The top suggestions from cospiratard are actually pretty good.</p>

<p>All in all, your arguments stem from just dislike the guy but fail to actually say <em>why</em> you dislike him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PR techniques are nefarious because they exploit human psychology, BP oil redesigning their logo to give you the impression that they are friends of nature is pure PR. It has nothing to do with furthering humanity or society, PR is selfish and manipulative. It&#39;s the reason why Bill Hicks said once to a crowd of people who came to watch his show &quot;if anyone here is in advertising or marketing, kill yourself&quot;.</p>

<p>These people have no loyalty, maybe that&#39;s why he skips from sub to sub, if you look at his comments you will notice that he isn&#39;t much of a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>Now as you say, this might not be very bad for a sub, if someone like that came in for a redesign and I myself admitted that some subs will benefit from it. But <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> being such a highly sensitive and politically oriented community is not as easily redesigned as <a href="/r/puppies">/r/puppies</a>. You have to be careful what you restrict and what not, and who is to say what may be posted and what not? Isn&#39;t that why upvotes and downvotes exist? </p>

<p>This community was built on plain html pages, nothing fancy just a board with a voting system and it became popular in this manner. The new trend in big subs is now to start putting in rules placed from above. <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is restricting links, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is being heavily &quot;censored&quot;. And now here comes this dude into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> looking to do the same, taking authority when none of us have even heard of the guy.</p>

<p>Now you say I dislike the guy, and I actually didn&#39;t in the beginning to be honest. I even posted some pretty stupid comments defending him and scolding the community. But I changed my mind when I began to &quot;investigate&quot; him and who he is as a person. </p>

<p>You use terms like &quot;cleaning&quot;,  &quot;cleansing&quot;, &quot;tidying up&quot; and those words are nice and all but what exactly do they mean? Cleaning up political discussion for example intuitively feels wrong on some level. The community will do the cleaning for itself don&#39;t you think? And if the community is suddenly overrun by morons then there is nothing that can be done. Once a sub reaches a certain popularity it begins to change, water down a bit and become in my own experience less qualitative.</p>

<p>People at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> need this sub to blow of a little steam, and it looks pretty chaotic at times. Sometimes a member will post a thread addressing the community and openly talking about changes and attitudes. This is a very natural way of interaction within a community. Someone from the outside coming here and trying to change it without our involvement, now that&#39;s a different matter, it&#39;s why so many of us were upset.</p>

<p>We might be overly worried, but I think we are just afraid that the sub will start changing dramatically and we will have to find another place to reside until the exact same scenario starts happening again. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long rant, I can&#39;t help myself. Can you name some of the changes you would advise?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I actually don&#39;t disagree with you, I just interpret the information a bit differently. For example, I don&#39;t place the blame on the PR techniques but on the people who use them for nefarious means. Techniques don&#39;t exploit, people do. PR techniques are used to get your point across more effectively, and for people to understand you better. It turns out that people are also prone to following others, and it seems that they are by nature ambivalent, or at least easily swayed by emotions. That information is useful for the ones that want to exploit the populace. Do I regret that advertisement changed from informing to manipulating? Yes, very very much. Do I regret that this information is public? Yes, but only due to the nature of our culture and not due to the nature of the information. This sort of information is vital to know, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be told to us. We may also arrive at the conclusions (though not methods, those are refined like a sort of science) of social engineering through self-reflection.</p>

<p>By cleansing I meant not being carried away in our pursuit of truth, so I speak of cleansing the process and not the outcome (although the outcome is also cleansed by this. Focusing solely on the outcome, on the external, is purely cosmetic and ultimately ineffective). This may clear up the intuitive feeling that moderating a political discussion is wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The community will do the cleaning for itself don&#39;t you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not. This is why our society is headed where it is; because once we fall into a habit, it&#39;s hard to break. Specially when this habit conceals a truth that&#39;s hard to swallow. Unfortunately we all too often fall prey to false causation and misguiding correlation because we intrinsically believe we are right. That&#39;s just confirmation bias. This is why it&#39;s important to, every once in a while, take a step back and consider the whole situation as a detached observer. And through this process, we can moderate/guide better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if the community is suddenly overrun by morons then there is nothing that can be done. Once a sub reaches a certain popularity it begins to change, water down a bit and become in my own experience less qualitative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, exactly. This is why it&#39;s important to moderate, to guide with a clear purpose in sight, before the fan hits the shit.</p>

<p>As to the changes, an excellent suggestion by somebody was &quot;move the conversation away from the assumption that nefarious acts are going down back to the question of wether or not nefarious acts are at hand,&quot; which is essentially saying that we must not take doubt (of wrongdoing) for proof (of wrongdoing). Asking, &#39;Now, that doesn&#39;t look quite right does it?&#39; is just the right thing to do. Another really good one is to &quot;make an initiative to raise awareness of and intolerance for groupthink&quot; and also to &quot;put the &#39;logical fallacies&#39; in the sidebar as a &#39;please read&#39;&quot;. Another is to stop shill accusations because that&#39;s like a mix of a straw-man with ad hominem. </p>

<p>I think the best suggestion was actually to become international. Conspiracy theorists don&#39;t have the best reputation. I&#39;d say it&#39;s wrong to assume that everything we see and hear is a lie, but it&#39;d be more wrong to assume that everything we see and hear is the truth. As far as the US government stands, they have lost all credibility (arguably it&#39;s been lost since Nixon/Reagan). Our government does not seem to stand for truth, so we shouldn&#39;t listen and swoon over what they say. I think we may all agree to this. So the conspiracy theorists have a bad reputation (at least here in the US) despite there being perfectly reasonable reasons for distrusting the government. So by becoming international, we could also focus on pointing out that all sorts of covert nefarious shit is happening all the time. This carries more weight, I would say, than looking at our own past history for validation. This would fit in line with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because the reason conspiracies are cast aside is because they seem unreasonable, yet they&#39;re happening all the time. So when we hear of a validated doubt or an actual conspiracy, domestic or foreign, we should immediately focus on it.</p>

<p>And thinking strictly of the US, maybe we could also focus on forces that directly and lawfully conspire agains the purpose of the nation. Lobbying comes to mind, petroleum and opium wars, new Jim Crow, bank bullshit, etc. In other words, shed light on obvious wrongdoing that under the narrative of MSM doesn&#39;t get the coverage that it deserves, thereby focusing not just on questions but also on facts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t post much if at all, but I lurk.  The big problem is that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is only getting more and more isolated by paranoid delusionals.  This is why <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> attempted to find out exactly why people are getting banned and moving out--actually, they&#39;ve not just moved out, they&#39;ve split and created the <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> parody subreddit.  I guarantee some are simply trolls, but it doesn&#39;t take a genius to see that there is a disease of a problem on this subreddit.</p>

<p>Expelling those that legitimately try to help you is the surest way to alienate yourself and is a one-way ticket to hopeless irrelevance.  <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> is only attempting to do what a leader is supposed to do.  When you have an issue, you get to the root of the problem--this is conflict resolution 101, people.  Let logic be your guide, not everything is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>P.S.: <a href="/u/sinominous">/u/sinominous</a>, GTFO with that &quot;shill&quot; name-calling bullshit.  Start thinking for yourself, you&#39;re as bad as the authority you speak against.  Just because you&#39;re holding a view opposite to mainstream doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not still a lemming to your ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;here&#39;s one&quot;, &quot;Zionist support of multiculturalism&quot;,  was pretty far from racist or antisemitic. If you read the post it is more of a cultural study. It is far from racist and is a blatant example of non-racist stuff that people assume is racist.</p>

<p>On the first page of Google results of &quot;Here are a bunch of others&quot;, I see a couple instances of this non-racist post about Zionist culture. I see &quot;Jews Demand Open Borders for America&quot;. which turns out to be reporting on a collective initiative by Jewish rabbis across the country; nothing racist there. Then there is &quot;The Jews didn&#39;t have anything to hide either when Hitler collected their data&quot;. This seems to be urging people to heed the warnings of Nazi action which are reflected in today&#39;s NSA spying. This is in bad taste, but no way antisemitic in my opinion. Next is &quot;Obvious Conspiracy against non jews in Israel&quot;, which is a video interview purporting to show actual street evidence of Israelis treating non-Jewish foreigners badly. I didn&#39;t watch it, but it seems not likely to be racist. Well &quot;Jews DO control the media&quot; must be a racist post right? No, actually it is an article by Times Of Israel which starts off &quot;We Jews are a funny breed.&quot; Well that turned out to be not antisemitic. Next is &quot;Helen Thomas: Jews in total control of U.S.&quot;, which is reporting on the veteran US reporter lashing out about Israel using the verbatim title. Reporting on that isn&#39;t antisemitic or racist. The next is &quot;Chief Rabbi of Israel Ovadia Yosef: &quot;The sole purpose of non-Jews is to serve Jews&quot;&quot; This is a verbatim copy from Wikipedia focusing on some disturbing public assertions by this prominent Israeli rabbi. Not specifically racist or antisemitic and doesn&#39;t push any interpretation. As the first commenter says &quot;Even though you quoted his words from his sermon, anyone who replies with anything that is anti his statement will be called an anti-semite.&quot; Last is &quot;New video illustrates how Zionist Jew Colonists&quot;. This used the proper term Zionist Jews instead of a blanket term and I haven&#39;t whatched it, but it likely shows more footage from Israel, which, if the video doesn&#39;t say racist stuff, it not racist or antisemitic.</p>

<p>tl;dr</p>

<p>So I got through one full page of Google search of  &quot;site:reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> jews&quot; and not a single fucking one of them was racist. I doubt many public forums can say that and urge you to try on other subreddits. I&#39;m pretty suprised and think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> just won a huge challenge with this. By these statics, it seems blatantly false for anyone to claim racism on this channel is frequent. It may exist, but it must be only in isolated rare instances.</p>

<p>*** We won! <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is not racist! ***</p>

<p>Yah, know, cause fuck theories, this is a news channel. And I&#39;m sure none of the people who drop buy to spew hatred aren&#39;t doing so purposely to troll from conspiratard.</p>

<p>Then you have BipolarBear0. He likes to organize vote brigades, organize posting racist comments on this subreddit, then turn around and be the shining knight who just hates racism so much and can&#39;t stand that conspiracy is full of racism. Then he goes around wrongfully claiming people are racist and globally banning them, then admits it with no repercussions. I wonder what he said:</p>

<p>Eventually this data results were torn to pieces, but I doubt people are going back to see what it says now. They only saw what it said the same day it was posted &#39;r/conspiracy is nothing but racists&#39;, then moved on with that burned in their mind.</p>

<p>Shills are real, and a theory about the source of some data or statement being from a shill is...you guessed it, a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I see a lot of speaking out against Israel and Zionism and very little else. I see a few isolated cases where people equate Israel and Zionism with &quot;Jews&quot; in general, which is wrong. Not exactly racism, but stereotyping in an non-socially acceptable way. I&#39;ve seen no direct racism here. The lure of trolls, randoms, nutjobs, and organized conspiratards to come here and start shit by making racist post probably amounts for most of that. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>In my observation, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has the same or less crossing the line than <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/">/r/worldpolitics</a> and <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldnews/">/r/worldnews/</a>. There seems a need to single out <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy,</a> but this need is malicious and wrong. There is no more racism here than other subs, which is to say very little. </p>

<p>Israel and its Zionist movement are doing a lot of horrible things in this world and are going to be criticized, discussed, and debated by conspiracy theorist, just as they will be by people passionate about world politics and world news. Criticizing these actions are frequently wrongfully feigned as antisemitism. Speaking out about these concerns will occasionally cross the line, but I don&#39;t think that happens here any more often than other subreddits.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t notice any antisemitism ignored here, especially not any more than say <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/">/r/worldpolitics</a> or <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldnews/">/r/worldnews</a>. I see nothing in <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that singles it out to be in common with <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights.</a> I think that is a shity accusation to make without something to back it up.  </p>

<p><a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does get obsessed with corruptions and secret evil world movements, so of course there is a lot of suspicion and talk about Israel and the Zionist Jews, their actions, intentions, and current events. There are many ligament reasons to feel particularly against their actions. Israel is ran by Zionist Jews. They totally infiltrated the US country with spies shortly before 9/11. People are suspicious that they had a plausible part to do with 9/11. The AIPAC Israeli lobby in the US is afforded special privilege to exert questionable influence on our government. Israel is constantly antagonizing us and trying to trick us into fighting its wars. Israel is an, occupying, apartheid state constantly doing horrible things to not just Palestinians but other groups of people based on race (like sterilizing black Arabs). Israeli technology companies are behind much of the illegal NSA spying and they receive unfiltered NSA data of US citizens.</p>

<p>The list could go on, but the fact is, Israel and its Zionist Jewish intentions are running a muck and a legitimate focus for conspiracy theories and conspiracy facts. You will here lots of negative talk about Israel and Zionism. This is not antisemitism. Anyone who says it is is a brainwashed nutjob. Let me tell you, there are many of them. If you say anything negative about Israel, you have a dozen people that wrongfully call you antisemitic. How can anyone discuss the real danger Israel and its Zionistic ventures pose to the world, like the Aryan Nazis once did, without being censored through feign calls of antisemitic racism?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many posters wrongfully equate all Jews with Zionist Jews and Israel. This happens no more often here than <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/">/r/worldpolitics</a> or <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldnews/">/r/worldnews</a> in my observation. We all need to help these people be more politically correct, but realize it is difficult. When you are emotionally outraged at another despicable Israeli murdering of children, you don&#39;t always take the time to use the proper terminology. Obviously people go to far, but I see the same, that this subreddit is no worse than any other in that respect.</p>

<p>People get a kick out of starting shit and trolling here. BipolarBear and his followers aren&#39;t the only ones. We have plenty randoms and crazies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many posters wrongfully equate all Jews with Zionist Jews and Israel. This happens no more often here than <a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a> or <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> in my observation. </p>

<p>They are angry about Muslims mostly, and the Roma.</p>

<p>Just why wouldn&#39;t you ban known whites rights poster <a href="/u/4to2">/u/4to2</a> ? I mean he&#39;s definitely not a false flag. He posts and is upvoted her e all the time. And then he spends the rest of his time talking about how jews and blacks are inferior. I think you will struggle to find a prominent poster in any sub I post in that is a known white supremacist. </p>

<p>Can we at least ban 1 white supremacist as a show of good faith that you guys don&#39;t implicitly support anti-semitism by allowing it to exist without any protest? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally support banning antisemitism, but I just haven&#39;t really seen it here. I&#39;m sure it is here. I do see a bit of the stereotyping Zionist and Israel actions and intentions as &quot;Jews&quot;. Maybe I miss some the the real controversial stuff, but I do spend way too much time here, and take it as a sign that this type of stuff isn&#39;t that prominent. I don&#39;t think moderators should be laxed or complacent, even with stereotyping blanket terms like &quot;Jews&quot;. I can understand that some will have emotional reactions to the disgusting apartheid actions of Israel, but if we are going to discus Israel and Zionism here, in this public forum, we should do so in a civilized way, using socially acceptable terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things....first, he did it in public.  Second, after the shit knocked the fan off the balcony, he engaged I don&#39;t even know how many people messaging him (as opposed to other mods like Bipolarbear who justy blow you off).  </p>

<p>I will admit it looked pretty bad on the surface, but his demotion does mean he cannot remove another mod.  It would also be nearly impssible for him to unilaterally change anything regarding this sub.  </p>

<p>Finally, last time I checked, nothing <em>has</em> changed (save a few people&#39;s preceptions).  Other than perhaps some deletions of redundant and rule #10 violating comments, are stories being censored?  Has anything actually changed?  I am more concerned with actions rather than words.  I don&#39;t necessarily see anything wrong with engaging with your enemies (nations do it all the time).  If he crosses the line and starts censoring posts that used to fly, then we have a legitimate gripe.  Until then, all he did was have a conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more. He went to conspiritard and sought advice on how to &quot;make this sub shape up&quot;. Then he proceeded to act like it was for our own good and that he was somehow doing us a favor. He then proceeded to call this sub close-minded and lectured members on how to &quot;tactfully reach-out&quot;, for what purpose I have no idea because most of us like the sub just how it is (minus the troll brigades and constantly being called racists). </p>

<p>Sadly, he&#39;s validated the fact that he understands that conspiritard is here to flame our sub any chance they get, otherwise he would&#39;ve went to <a href="/r/cooking">/r/cooking</a>. He decided to ride his story of superior knowledge, understanding, and wisdom for what this sub needs, based on the feedback of conspiritard, to the end. People blew up, he kept posting PR type bullshit to try to get a handle on things claiming how open minded he is, how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thinks it can do no wrong, and continuing to claim that he&#39;s some sort of enlightened fellow doing this all for us, although we&#39;re too close minded to understand (paraphrasing, and adding my own sentiments on how his comments came out). </p>

<p>Also, his withdrawn, lackadaisical demeanor when dealing with the mutiny on his watch has been appalling, to say the least. He truly does not give a shit and he has no business being a mod. On top of it, his &quot;demoted myself&quot; bone thrown our way was a slap in the face. First off, he should be disciplined. Where are the rest of the mods? Secondly, he did it to himself. Why is somebody being given the opportunity to discipline themselves in the face of such shit conduct? This speaks volumes to me and is very troubling to say the least. </p>

<p>He also had a great time distancing himself from the tin-foil hat aspect of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when he was at conspiritard. I fucking love my tin-foil hat and our mods should too, or they should find a new place to mod. </p>

<p>EDIT: I did some paraphrasing. Accurate or not, the paraphrasing is exactly how it came off to most of the upset members here so deal with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very saddened at how deeply this issue has caused a divide between users and mods in this sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very important for an uncensored place on reddit to be working in a manner wherein the users have trust in the ability of the mods to fight off reddit inc and her minions.</p>

<p>What has worried me about how solidwhetstone has approached this situation is the seemingly unaddressed elephant in the room; does he want influence here to help reddit inc &quot;keep control&quot; of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? </p>

<p>I have nothing against solidwhetstone. I think he&#39;s an alright guy. But I do think someone in reddit inc has been talking to him.</p>

<p>It is also a nuanced distinction, as the posts fall from the front page they do indeed become hidden from view. But I agree, there was no malicious censorship and the word &quot;removed&quot; was inappropriate.</p>

<p>That said, this sub hates all types of censorship (wherein not talking about a subject is but one form of how accessible information is kept suppressed) from what I&#39;ve seen so I sympathized with OP. </p>

<p>I wish users would refrain from attacking you and instead discuss the merits of your modship; but there is no way to force people into doing that. </p>

<p>Either way I&#39;m going to abstain from having any more say in this; as I feel I am a biased arbiter based on previous interactions with you and it has become difficult for me to approach the situation critically. </p>

<p>Edit because I&#39;m afraid my response was a bit shallow: </p>

<p>Many of the comments here are from veterans who are very involved in this sub on a daily and weekly basis. SWS has been very disruptive over the last week and his influence is not welcome, especially after he reached out to r/conspiratard. I myself enjoy this sub and take everything with skepticism but never outright dismissing a theory. There is always something to learn or research further. SWS is not interested in engaging with this sub, he (or she) seems much more interested in changing it into something its not intended to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good point, I myself am not exactly a veteran, I&#39;ve been here as long as this account has existed, and that&#39;s actually for every subreddit, I&#39;ve only had an account on Reddit for 3 months, I was a occasional lurker for half a year so really I&#39;m probably in no place to say what should be done, and if the overall consensus is that he should leave and he doesn&#39;t then I suppose there is a problem. </p>

<p>Why I care personally is because I like this sub, the premises mentioned in the sidebar are what appeals to me, and my concern is not that SWS deserves to be removed but that it was just a minority that are the ones being disruptive,of that I may be mistaken I have no doubt. </p>

<p>What I would like to see is a tally of people for/against his removal, and it should be a total of subscribers in this sub, it could be stickied so people could come on everyday and vote, instead of repeated posts like this that just say the same thing over, no offense to the OP. &amp; it could be abused but it&#39;s just something I&#39;d like to see before saying what the majority really want.</p>

<p>Calling someone a &quot;Zionist Jew&quot; is about as racist as calling someone a &quot;White KKK member&quot; or a &quot;White Separatist&quot;.</p>

<p>The terms &quot;white&quot; and &quot;Jew&quot; describe race/ethnicity, whereas the terms &quot;Zionist&quot;, &quot;KKK&quot; or &quot;Supremacist&quot; describe adherence to specific ideologies, all of which are viewed as objectionable by some, and are fair game for criticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trolls will be trolls. Many people are drawn to this drama, whom never frequent this subreddit, and drop in to drop a few troll posts and leave. Then there are organized groups (conspiratard) who get brigades together to do the same. Calling someone a &#39;Zionist Jew&#39; is not exactly racist by its self anyways, but it definitely isn&#39;t called for in this context.</p>

<p>There are serious reasons to be concerned and be critical of the Zionist movement and blanket calling anyone racist who speaks out about it is just stupid. We need this forum to openly discus the serious, dangerous, and very real Zionist movement.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame that the moderators don&#39;t have the balls to do what this whole subreddit would like to see happen. It&#39;s embarrassing what one moderator has turned their own subreddit into. When someone bans anyone who criticizes them, and uses an arbitrary interpretation of a rule as justification, they are abusing their authority. Couple that with the fact that they should&#39;t have that authority to begin with, and you get a subreddit that operates very much the same as the establishment their user-base is against. </p>

<p>The other mods need to take action and save this subreddit from being the joke it has tuned into. They need to do their jobs.</p>

<p>It means he cannot remove any other mods.  He is now the junior mod with the least power/tenure.  It also means he will not be able to unilaterally change anything of import to the sub.  To me, that answers the chief concern that many of us had.  I don&#39;t care if he talks to r/conspiratard.   I don&#39;t care if he engages them and asks them what they think he should do.  I do care what he actually does though.  Have there been any appreciable changes since all of this went down?  Are stories being censored that weren&#39;t before (not talking about this whoe bruhaha either).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to remain on the high road, as I believe that&#39;s where we&#39;ll all do best.  So I want to be respectful.</p>

<p>As I see it, the problem lies in the fact that you say you want to &quot;talk to your critics&quot;.</p>

<p>Please take this as constructive criticism, or me acting as &quot;Devil&#39;s advocate&quot;, or maybe just trying to explain to you why so many users find this situation so troubling.</p>

<p>You have already stated that you realize much of this is due to the perception that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is &quot;the enemy&quot; of this sub.  For the sake of my argument, please pretend that whether that perception, or the reaction to you interacting with them is appropriate or not is irrelevant.  (I think we could maybe let the whole thing slide, but let&#39;s think about why others might not be down with that)</p>

<p>Why would you ever need to go to /tard to get criticism?  You said most of those you would be getting input from were formerly from this sub (why were they banned in the first place if they&#39;re worthy of conversation?).  At this point, and I&#39;m sure previous to this little incident, you could find plenty of criticism within <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, so why go elsewhere?</p>

<p>The issue that I find within all of this is the fact that in the (informal, mind you) guidelines to modding subreddits, it says your duties are well-defined, to remove spammers and other violators of the rules.  So, what ideas are you seeking on the other sub?  What else are you considering doing, other than your preexisting duties?</p>

<p>Sorry for such a long comment, I just wanted to tell you what I see through my personal lens of interpretation.  At this point, education and harm reduction should be the goal.  This is a fiasco, and whether it is the fault of you the moderator, or if it rather demonstrates some kind of dysfunction within <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s community is sortof irrelevant.  We should try to make it the best subreddit possible, and at this point that goal seems stymied by the resentment toward you.  So, even if it&#39;s unfounded resentment, it must be resolved.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps if you outlined what you learned from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> that would be helpful and then perhaps took a sabbatical/hiaitus to actually let things cool down, it would be best.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read through your comment history, and you seem like a good mod, but the community is soured to you and rejecting you and that&#39;s not healthy.  I really think if you could put the subreddit before yourself it might be best.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, and I don&#39;t mean to sound condescending or anything.  I just wanted to try to sort things out the best I could in the open.</p>

<p>And, I might not be cut out for the job, but I would offer my time to moderate, if that could help at all.  Thanks everybody, and do try to stay on the high road- we want to use ideas, not insults.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>makes you seem overly paranoid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know, like believing in conspiracy theories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, the complaints are against direct racism, which there is a lot of here. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see a lot of speaking out against Israel and Zionism and very little else. I see a few isolated cases where people equate Israel and Zionism with &quot;Jews&quot; in general, which is wrong. Not exactly racism, but stereotyping in an non-socially acceptable way. I&#39;ve seen no direct racism here. The lure of trolls, randoms, nutjobs, and organized conspiratards to come here and start shit by making racist post probably amounts for most of that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a pretty clear line between anti-semitism and anti-Zionism and this subreddit crosses it all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my observation, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has the same or less crossing the line than <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/">/r/worldpolitics</a> and <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldnews/">/r/worldnews/</a>. There seems a need to single out <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy,</a> but this need is malicious and wrong. There is no more racism here than other subs, which is to say very little. </p>

<p>Israel and its Zionist movement are doing a lot of horrible things in this world and are going to be criticized, discussed, and debated by conspiracy theorist, just as they will be by people passionate about world politics and world news. Criticizing these actions are frequently wrongfully feigned as antisemitism. Speaking out about these concerns will occasionally cross the line, but I don&#39;t think that happens here any more often than other subreddits.</p>
