    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s only because users know that the other subreddits (like politics) are heavily scrutinized by people with interests. There was a surge of complaints about censorship around a year ago, which prompted an exodus to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the remedy is for that to be honest. To me, it&#39;s not that damaging, but I can understand if some people find this place to be too &quot;doom-and-gloomy&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The remedy is simply submitting that type of content and encouraging that type of discussion by presenting an argument that captures ones attention and imagination. As a subscriber to both subs, I would gladly participate in those types of discussions. Don&#39;t think that just because it isn&#39;t the norm here at the moment doesn&#39;t mean it cant evolve there, and even if there&#39;s only like 5-10 posters that are interested you can always just try and have a great discussion in those threads and hope casual readers catch on. You yourself have the power to evolve the discourse of the content and discussion here, you can only hope to be convincing enough to ensure it catches on and spreads. I&#39;d say give it a shot because even though discussing political corruption is the current trend, it&#39;s impossible not to be intereseted in the concept of how certain events are interpreted and analyzed by the subconscious mind. What&#39;s the phrase again? Small minds discuss events and great minds discuss ideas? Let&#39;s bring that concept back to this sub, I&#39;ve been itching for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your suggestion a lot. It also means that we need to have zero tolerance for those who ridicule or demean in other ways. </p>

<p>Civil discourse has to be cultivated more here, it&#39;s why I suggested that this subreddit should introduce guidelines besides the rules. Also to remove the symbolism which I find limits this subreddit. Open-mindedness and complete void of bias needs to be the focal points IMO.</p>

<p>Maybe have certain themes some days with stickied posts? I don&#39;t know, that might sound a bit too kindergarten-ish though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. The only thing is zero tolerance seems to be somewhat authoritarian by nature. This whole fiasco came about because of the community, what we need to encourage is unbiased open minded discussion but at the same time, as you said, cultivate civil discourse in a manner that encourages intellectual discussion. Of course, that&#39;s not going to happen overnight as a community, but as I said we can just be the change we wish to see in the world, and hope it catches on because truth resonates with people. It&#39;s hard to have zero tolerance and at the same time be 100% opened minded because sometimes you need your antithesis to either forge your synthesis or reaffirm your thesis. The big question is obviously where do we draw the line. When people say we are silencing the opposition by banning conpiratard posters, we need to look to the subs opinion as a whole in order to determine whether they&#39;re here just to disagree (so long as they provide a reason why backed with evidence) or they are just downright trolling and brigading the community. I think with time, we will get a better understanding. In either case, I&#39;m glad this sub took a stand and got results, regardless of what type of person <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> is in real life. It was clear he didn&#39;t understand this subreddit and what it represents </p>

<p>Edit: i think the stickied thread idea is great, but I&#39;d like to see it be centered on self posts because those types of posts typically bring out the actual theorist in people. It&#39;s easy to sticky a news article and go ape shit on it, but I think the whole psychonaut conspiracy crossover will come from getting people to understand who we are, not just what our opinions about politics are.</p>

<p>These last couple of years have felt very gloomy though, but that&#39;s more to do with how politics is conducted rather than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sharing it.</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s nothing wrong with taking a break if you don&#39;t feel like reading it. It&#39;s good for you to say &quot;fuck the world&quot; once in a while. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; has been so ridiculed over time that almost everyone I engage in discussion with now genuinely thinks the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; refers to something a &quot;conspiracy theorist&#39; believes. </p>

<p>I was talking with my father the other day (who worked for over 30 years as an administrator in the public education system). We were briefly discussing 9/11 and I pointed out to him that no matter which stance you took; let&#39;s say you believe the official story  or you believe something else happened, you are a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; as the 19 hijackers part of the story has never been proven, only alleged. It&#39;s still a  conspiracy theory that they were involved. He stopped me and kind of off-handedly said, &quot;well, not a &#39;conspiracy&#39; because that&#39;s what the government said happened.&quot; Inferring that if you believe the government&#39;s version of events it can&#39;t be a conspiracy because conspiracies aren&#39;t real. </p>

<p>I was surprised hearing that from him so I curiously asked him what the definition of &#39;conspiracy&#39; meant to him. He didn&#39;t answer right away and I could see the gears turning in his head. When I gave him the proper definition he had a slightly embarrassed &#39;duh&#39; look on his face and I think he understood the point I was trying make, but the most interesting thing to me was how even a person like him had been influenced by the way the word has been used and twisted over the years. </p>

<p>also, think before you upvote: &quot;is this <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> material?&quot;, by upvoting you are approving of that type of submission and encouraging more of it...</p>

<p>A stunt by <a href="/u/donbueno">/u/donbueno</a> (ex-mod) where he removed all mods under him (leaving only himself and illuminatedwax) caused some turbulence for half a day. He lost it when 9000sins suggested and began to implement the (IMO sensible) rule that accounts under 1 month in age (typically ban circumventers from the &#39;tard club) would be disallowed from commenting and posting in here.</p>

<p>Apparently OP had to telephone his AFK friend illuminatedwax to get donbueno removed and things back to normal, because top mod here doesn&#39;t really use reddit anymore. OP was modded during this and stayed around for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Top mod here scooped up tons of subreddits on day one. They probably aren&#39;t a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; either.</p>

<p>You clearly did not read his original post  to conspiratard or the comments that were made; most (not all) surprised me by being measured and considered.  Doesn&#39;t mean we listen to a word they say but we should have seen it as a strength that one of our mods reached out to our major critics. </p>

<p>Seriously, why do you think asking for evidence is trolling? If I told you hippos could fly or the Amanabi people of Guatemala had built working radios in the 300s, you&#39;d want proof, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man. Just give up on trying to change these people. It won&#39;t do any good. </p>

<p>The horrible misconceptions and blatant racism, bigotry, and ignorance in people cannot be amended by a mod in an Internet forum. It won&#39;t turn the tides or change people&#39;s faith; and let&#39;s face it, the conspiracy-theorist&#39;s beliefs are held together with faith. Same as the religious faith only it is faith in whatever their particular brand of theory they believe. The people&#39;s faith cannot be broken easily.</p>

<p>But then there are the people that make money off of conspiracy theories. They take advantage of these different faiths or mentalities. Look at all the websites, authors, and groups. They are money making enterprises, committed to perpetuating the illusion these authors have created for themselves. Look at all the people that believe this nonsense, that is a big market. Many millions of dollars are there for the taking if you can bend the truth in such a way to create a credible story. It&#39;s naive to think otherwise. </p>

<p>CT&#39;s are really the perfect market: they are glutinous consumers, they are loyal to their brand, they are unwavering in their dedication to consume the product, they become addicted rather fast, quitting is extremely tough and they brainwash themselves (no need for 
marketing)</p>

<p>It is a commercial and cultural system that cannot be &#39;fixed&#39; because it is already the way it is supposed to be. Move on or try and profit. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll find liberalism as a tool of the ultra elite dating back many decades in discussions of conspiracy theories. How this has suddenly fallen away from the mainstream conspiracy theory believers is both interesting and frightening.</p>

<p>The moment you start telling other people what they can&#39;t believe, and what they can&#39;t say, you are one of THEM, not one of US.</p>

<p>You have every right to disagree, but don&#39;t ever try to force your disagreement on everyone else as the standard by which we should all live. You don&#39;t have that right.</p>

<p>Really I still don&#39;t understand your point, are you saying there are only black criminals? No <a href="http://www.google.ca/url?q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush&amp;amp;sa=U&amp;amp;ei=WTm9UrHvCoL02wXY3IHwDw&amp;amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEDOQvAs-7uqFlCKdo1gYCyctsv5w">white criminals</a> or <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_China">chinese criminals</a> exist? If that is the case, what are your recommendations for this vastly dangerous problem that is &quot;the nature of black crime&quot;?</p>

<p>[EDIT]; &amp; if it&#39;s any consolation I&#39;m canadian &amp; I can tell you I&#39;d certainly rather fight for myself than be beaten to death, but thanks to my government I will likely still be beaten to death without proper means to defend myself against criminals, &amp; before you ask no I&#39;m not concerned with race when I&#39;m being attacked.</p>

<p>Now if I were to understand you correctly, you are saying I should want segregation of all ethnicities from one another in order to avoid confrontation? &amp; to be against separating all of mankind from one another is a liberal idea propagated by the illuminati to make us all weaker?</p>

<p>&amp; lastly, what does this have to do with <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">/u/solidwhetstone</a> stepping down? Because you have a problem with him for his opinion that segregation/racism is wrong? He stepped down so why do you feel this is relevant?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As noted above, scholars acknowledge that some racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States. The data from 2008 reveals that Black Americans are over-represented in terms of arrests made in virtually all types of crime, with the exceptions of &quot;Driving under the influence&quot; and &quot;Liquor laws&quot;. Overall, Black Americans are arrested at 2.6 times the per-capita rate of all other Americans, and this ratio is even higher for murder (6.3 times) and robbery (8.1 times)</p>

<p>The other half is EVERY OTHER RACE COMBINED. Think about it a fucking moment. 13% of the population (blacks) is committing 50% of the murder. The other 87% of the population (everyone else combined) is committing half the murder. </p>

<p>Is this REALLY too hard for you to grasp? </p>

<p>Blacks commit murder far and above their population percentage. NO OTHER RACE does this .</p>

<p>My source are FBI yearly crime breakdown by race. It&#39;s the same every fucking year. Blacks are complete trash. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>pretty sure poverty is what your mistaking it with by those &quot;stats&quot;</p>

<p>The endless excuse. Everywhere on the planet blacks are the same, and idiots like yourself will always think it&#39;s because they are somehow discriminated against, but they live in poverty because they don&#39;t ever TRY to get ahead. They tear down every civilization they are a part of. You&#39;ve been programmed into simply excusing them, your entire generation is a bunch of losers spoonfed with excuses for blacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when my own brother said he saw my name pop up in his reddit feed and he read every single thing about me gave me the advice to step down- I was willing to really consider it. One thing about him is he knows me really well. And he said some people were saying things about me that he knew to be true- from actually growing up with me. And it made me think about whether I am truly a fish out of water and just don&#39;t realize it. He and I have been through the shit together, so I took his advice since he may be seeing some angles I&#39;m not.</p>

<p>This comment proves you just don&#39;t understand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp; 50%? that&#39;s half, whose the other half?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other half is EVERY OTHER RACE COMBINED. Think about it a fucking moment. 13% of the population (blacks) is committing 50% of the murder. The other 87% of the population (everyone else combined) is committing half the murder. </p>

<p>Is this REALLY too hard for you to grasp? </p>

<p>Blacks commit murder far and above their population percentage. NO OTHER RACE does this .</p>

<p>My source are FBI yearly crime breakdown by race. It&#39;s the same every fucking year. Blacks are complete trash. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>pretty sure poverty is what your mistaking it with by those &quot;stats&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The endless excuse. Everywhere on the planet blacks are the same, and idiots like yourself will always think it&#39;s because they are somehow discriminated against, but they live in poverty because they don&#39;t ever TRY to get ahead. They tear down every civilization they are a part of. You&#39;ve been programmed into simply excusing them, your entire generation is a bunch of losers spoonfed with excuses for blacks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, Black Americans are arrested at 2.6 times the per-capita rate of all other Americans, and this ratio is even higher for murder (6.3 times) and robbery (8.1 times)</p>
