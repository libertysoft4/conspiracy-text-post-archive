<p>This clearly goes against everything we stand for. This rule must go! This rule has laid a heavy hand to censor everything around the current inner subbreddit controversy issue. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t present the conspiratard hate group a platform to falsely accuse subreddit of being full of racism and bigotry, then censor anyone who speaks out about it. Sure that was a stupid move, but not evil. Not everyone realizes conspiratard is a hate group that frequently mobilizes in our subreddit to make racist post, troll and manipulate people, and manipulate our voting system. Not everyone knows conspiratard has some very well rounded mods who are known for abusing their moderator powers and using them to falsely accuse people of racism and globally banning them for kicks. Then admitting it and receiving no repercussions. There is even accusations that their mod was involved in the mismanagement of the Restore The Fourth donations.</p>

<p>While this is a complicated issue that needs dealt with, the mass censoring of this issue&#39;s discussion using rule 10 has been a travesty that has destroyed all credibility.</p>

<p>RULE 10 MUST GO!</p>

<p>Bans are made by moderator consensus. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you clarify this rule for us? I just want someone to explain exactly what it means. It seems like you are saying the bans are just handed out haphazardly, then the un-banning happens by moderator consensus. If the mod who first handed out the ban simply doesn&#39;t want to consent to an un-ban, that means only one mod is needed to ban anyone they wish. If so, I think rule 6 needs to be worded better. Currently, it looks like it&#39;s just simply a false statement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very true. I think the answer is to demarcate between attacking a user and making a general statement. </p>

<p>Example.</p>

<p>Saying one user is a piece of trash over and over should probably draw a ban hammer.</p>

<p>Referring to a group of evil people with vulgar slurs should never be banned.</p>

<p>A nuanced, but important, distinction. </p>

<p>I would add that I think there should be unrestricted criticisms of moderators allowed (no harassment though); as it&#39;s too much of a conflict of interest to determine what&#39;s an attack on a mod and what&#39;s a legitimate criticism. Let the parties speak their sides of the story, and then allow the downvotes and upvotes do the talking in that situation.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t say what your particular beef is. You mention conspiratard and state that rule 10 is being used to censor some discussion of that? I saw one ban that seemed spot on and one that I thought was iffy and apparently got overturned by the mods altogether. You know better?</p>
