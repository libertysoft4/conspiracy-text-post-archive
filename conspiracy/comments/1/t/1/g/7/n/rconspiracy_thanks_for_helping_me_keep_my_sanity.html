        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been a redditor since the summer and I just want you all to know that this community is important since it enforces what a majority of us know to be true. That our government, our economy, and media are a trigemony. A hegemony is where the government and the ideology (church) have the same agenda and operate together, which is illegal. What we have going on is much worse. They are all in cahoots, all corrupt. The current state of America is hypocritical to the ideals it was founded upon and is fascist.</p>

<p>I wanted to let you all know that I&#39;ve discussed many of the subjects on here with my professor and fellow students in my media, state and society class. We spoke a lot of Snowden, the NSA/CIA/DEA, the Constitution, the War on Terror but even went further into issues not discussed in the mainstream media such as depleted uranium and chem-trails. These are all true issues that we certainly do face. So stay Brave in this New World. Our media may be straight propaganda, but there are many educated Americans who have their glasses on.</p>

<p>A 47 story building falling straight down into it&#39;s own footprint in under 7 seconds, due to office fire?  No person with two functional brain cells could believe that crap.  It&#39;s just as stupid to see that in print as it is to hear it out loud.</p>

<p>Anyone that can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlyFlDSscRQ">watch the video of the &quot;collapse&quot; of WTC7</a>, and still think it was caused by office fires, is an idiot.

    <div class="md"><p>Hardy har har.  Lizard people.  Your juvenile humor is soooo funny.</p>

<p>You&#39;re just talking out of your ass.  You&#39;re some ill-informed conspiratard troll that couldn&#39;t care less about facts and the truth so you&#39;re just leaving your turd droppings here so we all have to step around them and waste our time with your poorly formed &#39;thoughts.&#39;</p>

<p>Show me how fireproofing only works for a few hours.  If a fully fireproofed beam is subjected to 1200 degree fire are you telling me it will only work for about 8 hours then fail?  How does the fireproofing fail from a &quot;normal&quot; office fire?</p>

<p>The official story on the towers is that the fireproofing was ripped off but that&#39;s ridiculous as well because only small portions would be ripped off and the steel will still be mostly protected (not to mention it&#39;s idiotic to think mostly aluminum planes are going to sever steel beams, etc.).  </p>

<p>Fireproofing is designed to consistently withstand certain temperatures, dipshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome...that&#39;s the basics...Conspiracy 101 if you will...care to go further down the rabbit hole?</p>

<p>...try your &quot;open&quot; mind on these topics...&quot;counter intelligence operations&quot; ...&quot;psychological operations (psyops, Colonel Stubblepine for example, not to mention that Gloria Steinem was a CIA agent paid to spread divisive feminist ideology, extremely successful operation), &quot;Limited Hangout Operation&quot; (Snowden and Assange are LHO agents and not legit whistleblowers...another succesful operation) not to mention vaccine science fraud or big-pharma and SSRIs, or Darwinian evolution or carbonazis or zero point energy or esoteric Christianity. </p>

<p>Push further!</p>

<p>A hegemony is where the government and the ideology (church) have the same agenda and operate together, which is illegal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not the definition of a hegemony. A hegemony is, as Oxford Dictionary puts it, &quot;leadership or dominance, especially by one country or social group over others: <em>Germany was united under Prussian hegemony after 1871.</em></p>
