    <div class="md"><p>My advice for the doubtful? Plant seeds, then walk away. Don&#39;t try to convince or &quot;overload&quot; anyone because you&#39;ll just appear fanatical. Start w a conspiracy in their hobby interest, like w my ex, I started talking about sports being corrupt and organized. He deeply loves his sports but because we had the &quot;gee, ain&#39;t it funny the <em>Patriots</em> won the Super Bowl after 9/11...&quot; conversation,  I was able to talk about if that one point was true, what else could be orchestrated. Don&#39;t try to throw someone down the rabbit hole. Think about how many &quot;aha! moments&quot; went into (&amp; still happening) your awakening. Good luck. </p>

<p>Now, some really depressing shit, guess what money, the ultimate system of control, is being manipulated by a small group of people through something known as the London Interbank Offering Rater, or LIBOR.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/everything-is-rigged-the-biggest-financial-scandal-yet-20130425">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/everything-is-rigged-the-biggest-financial-scandal-yet-20130425</a></p>

<p>exponentially bigger then something small like Enron.  This is the whole game.  On this note I want to expound for a second, if you will.  I read the newspaper every day.  And regular as clockwork, theres an article about someone getting in trouble for corruption.  Now, if the world was as people think it is, these people would be acting furtively, like spies.  However, when the get caught, they always are being so obvious about it. They talk like frat bros about ripping people off of trillions of dollars.  Its clear to me that as far as Big Banking goes, stealing is the name of the game, until &quot;they&quot; have a problem with you, then they trash you through the media.  Too big to fail, bullshit ill watch big banks burn to the ground before I die, something thats not too big to fail is my dick.</p>

<p>Something that really made this clear to me was the recent Ron Calderon corruption scandal in Sacramento.  He was so fucking stupid about it.  Its so obvious they know they have nothing to worry about cause the whole game is rigged, until &quot;someone&quot; has a reason to take you out.</p>

<p>All the NSA stuff from the homie Ed Snowden and Glenn Greenwald, of course.  Hats off to those guys.</p>

<p>Wagging the moondoggie, I swear this guy is such a great writer its a joy to have everything youve known, loved and believed in desecrated before your eyes.</p>

<p>Why is weed illegal?  Why are psychedelics so persecuted?
<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=life+sentence+for+lsd">https://www.google.com/#q=life+sentence+for+lsd</a></p>

<p>So many people.  Neither LSD or Weed has a LD50 anywhere near dangerous, in fact, neither has been precisely calculated.</p>

<p>&quot;We want to take an excursion here and learn a little pharmacology. If you&#39;re going to talk about pharmacology, there is one concept that you should get straight, and that&#39;s called LD50. It means &quot;lethal dose 50&quot;. What does this mean? Well, you have 20 rats and you give them a certain amount of, let&#39;s say, mescaline. When half the rats die, that dose, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight, is called the LD50. And when pharmacologists assess the danger in a drug, they ask the following question, &quot;what is the relation of the LD50 to the effective dose?&quot;, and if the LD50 of a drug is only 20 times the effective dose, that&#39;s considered an incredibly toxic, dangerous, and dubious drug. A good drug is a drug where the LD50 is 200 times more than the effective dose. In the case of LSD, the LD50 for man has never been determined. That&#39;s how safe LSD is. We&#39;re talking about lethality here, not you know. So people say, &quot;Well are there unsafe psychedelics?&quot; Well, yes, you just look up the LD50s, line them up, and see which ones have the better ratios. By that measurement, by that standard, LSD is the most desirable. But the LD50 of psilocybin is very impressive. You can take 100 times the effective dose of psilocybin and expect to live. Mescaline, not. Mescaline has a bad profile. As an amphetamine, if you took 20 times the effective dose of mescaline, you would probably die. Of course, an effective dose of mescaline is nearly a gram of pure material, 700 milligrams. If you took 20 times 700 milligrams you would be taking nearly 2/3 of an ounce of mescaline...&quot; (Terrence McKenna)</p>

<p>Fuck yeah.  Do mushrooms with him again.  Fuck him good and tell him you love him and the power of love will overcome everything.  Remember, your relationship is the most important thing here, they can only win this battle if they succeed in dividing and conquering us, but as far as I can tell, most people like love, cuddling, kisses, holding hands, and talking, so I think we&#39;re ok.</p>

<p>Ok, heres one: the ubiquitous eye symbol.  Everywhere, even on the 1 dollar bill.  Fuck that creepy shit.</p>

I remember Taking A.P. Euro in High School.  What exactly happened to all that money that the Medici and Hapsburg families had?  Is it possible that the &quot;American Revolution&quot; was not truly an overt war, but rather a <em>covert</em> takeover? Is it possible the Medicis and Hapsburgs morphed into the Rockefellers of the world who coordinated the Great Depression?  Could we really have beaten Great Britain at the time, a few pioneer upstarts against the most formidable army and navy in the world, or did they just install their bloodline as our rulers, eventually get the IRS in as tax collectors?  Where does the income tax go?

    <div class="md"><p>Part I-OP I wrote you an essay, so I had to split it up.  i got really into this so I hope you use it.</p>

<p>Its really, really tough to convince someone about this stuff if they were raised the right way (operant conditioning).  Im gonna list some shit you should say, cause theres not really one or two videos you can show him that will instantly change years, decades of conditioning.  You will have to do this over several weeks.  Ill tell you how I personally got into it, being male, and maybe that will help you help your boyfriend find truth.</p>

<p>First, if youre cool with it, smoke weed or do mushrooms/lsd with him, and make him have a great time, but dont bring up anything heavy yet</p>

<p>This might sound kinda weird, but watch the show dexter.  Talk with him about how maybe not everybody who is a bad person looks like a thug on the street, or freddy krueger, but often these people are the nicest ones and the ones you have to watch out for are the ones who put up a good camouflage, just like in nature.</p>

<p>First of all, not to start off weird, but what the fuck is this:</p>

<p>Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars. This document dated May 1979, was found on July 7, 1986 in an IBM copier bought at an auction of military equipment. Negligence or intentional leak, this text has been in possession of the secret services of the U.S. Navy. For safety reasons, the document does not include the signature of the organization where it came from. But information and dates clippings left believing that these Bilderberg Group, a &quot; discussion club &quot; that meets the extremely powerful worlds of finance, economics, politics, the armed forces and services secrets.</p>

<p>Weird coincidences/super creepy Bush reading a book called &quot;My pet goat&quot; while having kids chant &quot;plane must kite hit steel&quot;...on 9/11. Documented fact.  In my opinion, they flaunt it like this not cause they actually believe it, but to leave their mark in the history books, as a sign to the rest of the elite, as a warning to other world powers, to scare those of us who have eyes to see.

Just some misplaced spare change, 3.2 TRILLION dollars, announced on 9/10/01</p>

<p>A measure of abnormal long put volume was also examined and seen to be at abnormally high levels in the days leading up to the attacks. Consequently, the paper concludes that there is evidence of unusual option market activity in the days leading up to September 11 that is consistent with investors trading on advance knowledge of the attacks.[70] —Allen M. Poteshman, The Journal of Business</p>

<p>Former white house anti terrorism czar (i hate that they actually use the word czar) and &quot;close friend&quot;of former CIA director George Tenet alleges that the CIA covered some shit up.  From the article:
In the interview for the documentary, Clarke offers an incendiary theory that, if true, would rewrite the history of the 9/11 attacks, suggesting that the CIA intentionally withheld information from the White House and FBI in 2000 and 2001 that two Saudi-born terrorists were on U.S. soil—terrorists who went on to become suicide hijackers on 9/11.

One thing I will recommend is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfpO-WBz_mw">The Money Masters</a> -- it&#39;s a bit antiquated and pretty long, but it breaks down all the relevant history of this most important subject that the education system, media and body politic have withheld from you all these years.</p>

<p>By the way heres another one, I learned about this in Environmental Studies at UCSB, one of the best schools in the country, especially for environmental stuff like this.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy</a></p>

<p>What the fuck? and we only know about this because some guy spent a decade in a library buried in decades on accounting paperwork.  Seriously.  A guy made it his lifes work to go over old receipts and shit in the library of congress, working hard as fuck every day, just to untangle this story so people like me and you could actually understand what happened.  I fucking payed 20 grand a year to study this shit.</p>

<p>Feel free to look into Sandy Hook and Boston more all you want.  Unfortunately their disinfo game has gotten so good, I dont even bother with the new stuff like that anymore.  This is shocking though:
 <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/05/fbi-bandits-executed-friend-of-boston-suspect-dad-says/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/05/fbi-bandits-executed-friend-of-boston-suspect-dad-says/</a></p>

<p>The movie Esoteric Agenda on youtube is great, as is Zeitgeist.  HOWEVER!  They fall into the category of disinformation where they mix SOME truth in with their lies, so you have to be careful, follow your gut as to what is real and what is not.  Heres some opinions from me:  They are not reptilians.  They are scared old fat white dudes wearing ill fitting suits who probably have bad gastrointestinal tracts.  Fuck them.  Jesus probably exsisted, and maybe was the Son of God here to show us the kingdom of heaven is within us here on Earth.  Ill tell you, im good at research, and I read a lot, and the evidence is <em>compelling</em> that <em>something</em> out of the ordinary happened about 2000 years ago.  I give it 50/50 aliens/god.  But all thats speculation (please, no hate mail I know how you r/atheism people get :)  </p>

<p>One more thing-they poison us with the food, they put flouride in the water, they spray something in the air.</p>

<p>So, OP.  Did that help?  Its about time for me to go roll up a spliff.  I ended up spending a while on that, but it was actually really cathartic.  I might print all this out and carry it around with me all the time in a binder.  Haha, just kidding. Sometimes I want to though, I swear.  Cause I&#39;m just a crazy, tinfoil hat wearing paranoid schizophrenic idiot, right?</p>
