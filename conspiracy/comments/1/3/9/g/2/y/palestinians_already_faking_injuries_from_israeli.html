<p>no matter how many other bad parties in the world you can distract with, the fact remains that israel needs to stop the annexation of palestine. </p>

<p>you can agree or disagree with that statement, but don&#39;t go off on a tangent about how america (israel&#39;s biggest ally btw) is also genocidal. it is not relevant, and doesn&#39;t help your point anyway.</p>

<p>I sense a double standard. You&#39;re saying Israel needs to stop doing something that 99% of human civilizations have done at one point or another. </p>

<p>I mean just pick a random country - Vietnam - the only reason that country extends down to the mekong delta is because the vietnamese conquered the Cham civilization and confiscated all their land. Today no one seriously disputes that territory is part of Vietnam. In fact during the Vietnam war it was fashionable to criticize the USA for invading &quot;vietnamese&quot; territory in that area and interfereing with &quot;Vietnamese&quot; sovereignty. But Israel gets berated for doing the same thing Vietnam did when it conquered that territory and made it part of Vietnam.</p>

<p>I&#39;m responding to the claim that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/139g2y/palestinians_already_faking_injuries_from_israeli/c71zl8c">&quot;Jew&#39;s are the scourge of the earth. The worst group of people in all recorded history.&quot;</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m simply  pointing out the sheer idiocy of that claim. Jews seem to be treating the Palestinians a lot better than, say, the Russians treated the Chechens. The West Bank has actually seen double digit economic growth in recent years  with tech companies like Google and Cisco investing in new facilities there.</p>

<p>Sure I do. The memoirs of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca are evidence that there were once tribes of indigenous people in the southwestern United States who were wiped out by the Spanish. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if I am. I would still tell a native american that there&#39;s evidence their land was stolen, that it was a crime to steal their land, and that I enjoy reaping the proceeds of that crime. I think most native Americans are resigned to the fact that us foreigners aren&#39;t going anywhere.</p>

<p>you have no evidence to support that claim.</p>

<p>Sure I do. The memoirs of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca are evidence that there were once tribes of indigenous people in the southwestern United States who were wiped out by the Spanish. </p>

<p>The Spanish conquered far more territory and slaughtered far more people than jews ever did. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>for all you know the person responding to you is a native american anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t care if I am. I would still tell a native american that there&#39;s evidence their land was stolen, that it was a crime to steal their land, and that I enjoy reaping the proceeds of that crime. I think most native Americans are resigned to the fact that us foreigners aren&#39;t going anywhere.</p>
