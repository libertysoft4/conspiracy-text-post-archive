<p>basic forensic science as well as applied investigatory journalism and statistical methodology led to an article published in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/prescription/la-me-prescription-deaths-20121111-html,0,2363903.htmlstory">LA Times</a>, which draws interesting comparison data between prescription drug overdose deaths and heroin deaths. 10 seconds.</p>

<p>welcome to the wonderful world of conspiracy polemic. additionally, not all theorists are equally satisfied with either the integrity of their information or their own synthesis of it. not all who pose as theorists possess integrity, and indeed, not all who post here are even theorists, or are even working for our betterment. these are just simple truths of the field.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I bite for a more sophisticated bait than this, I&#39;m afraid. </p>

<p>ultimately, one thing that is crucially important is that crucially important evidence that could allow for open scientific inquiry has been done away with unethically, and against proven and accepted standards and practices.</p>

<p>have a cookie. not everyone believes what they read. and those that do will probably defend it, regardless of its veracity and implications. just ask the questions that are needed. sometimes that&#39;s all people need. and that&#39;s certainly all you can do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a movement of science in the conspiracy realm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>much of what is done in the conspiracy realm is an application of ethical, political and financial transparency inquiry. many times, it is these angles that yield the best arguments for the existence of conspiracy. </p>

<p>but many times, as well, these arguments become drowned out among a myriad of sensational rephrasing of the relevant material, or are reframed in such a way as to be &quot;scientifically debunked.&quot; in mind obviously I have the very GMO companies you mentioned. It&#39;s not an argument over whether or not GMOs are scientifically proven to harm living things, it&#39;s an inquiry into the behaviors of GMO producers that should raise enough alarms to warrant serious investigation, first and foremost.</p>

<p>Conspiracy Theorists are supposed to be truth seekers, people who just want to know the truth behind what goes on in our world.

<p>No it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s <strong><em>a</em></strong> process of human understanding - not <em>&quot;the&quot;</em> process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its about figuring out how things work with hypothesis, testing, experimentation and resulting evidence.</p>

<p>Not only is it not the only discipline that does this, but the honest truth is that science - again, as it is practiced on this planet - would indeed be <em>great</em> if it unanimously was about the things that you just finished stating you think it&#39;s about.  Unfortunately, however, it has often time proven that it is more about corporate interest, manipulation, and power than it is about truth - so much so and so often as a matter of fact, that one would be extremely remiss at committing oneself to the mistaken idea that true and <em>real</em> science is practiced here to anywhere near the extent that it should be.  It isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This is agreed and correct.  Unfortunately, you would be surprised, I must at this point say, with the abysmal and negligible number of, as you call them &quot;good&quot; scientists that really exist on this plane.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is my point exactly.</p>

<p>Which, again, is my point exactly.  It is unfortunate that you apparently do not (cannot?) see that you are actually agreeing with everything I have said thus far.</p>

<p>I had this very understanding before you explained it - but thank you for doing so anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is nothing like &quot;religion&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such might seem the case in theory, but - in spite of what many wish to think or believe - much of the practice of this theory ends up looking quite a bit like the very thing that many often go so far out of their way to separate themselves from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps if you gave science a chance you would see that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps if you investigated the various cases where corporate truth absolutely trumped scientific truth, you might understand some things as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suppose you&#39;ve had some bad experiences with a few bad people who happen to hold credentials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go that far.  Most of the bad experiences I&#39;ve had are with the many here on Reddit that dogmatically genuflect before the blood alter of sacred science like blind followers.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t misunderstand here:  Science is absolutely beautiful.  It&#39;s just that most people have no idea what it actually is or how it&#39;s actually practiced.  I&#39;m not going to try and say that <em>I</em> in particular am &quot;one of the few that <em>does</em> know&quot;.  There&#39;s certainly far more that I don&#39;t know than there is that I do.  However - and again - I&#39;ve simply seen enough to understand that the close-minded belief that I&#39;ve witnessed many place upon science and what it &quot;can and cannot&quot; do is no less frightening than the worst kind of religious zealotry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These views are central to science and essential and foundational in its teachings and execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with this.  And yet there are glaring elephant-in-the-room discrepancies existing whereby much of what the human race is taught is &quot;scientific truth&quot; has actually shown itself to have been undermined over and over again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It may not be perfect but its something based on as I said, evidence theory testing experiments and all of that stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the theory here is commendable.  The execution of it on this planet sucks, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion is the exact opposite of that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I do feel that religion in general leaves a <em>LOT</em> to be desired, it is also most definitely the case that some religions are absolutely based upon &quot;evidence theory testing experiments and all of that stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>Science, religion, etc - when practiced properly - are awesome, very effective, and all quite significant and valuable pieces to The Great Puzzle.</p>

<p>The way that they (science, religion, etc) are practiced on this planet, however, leaves a great deal to be desired, and often makes a mockery of the truth that each discipline in its own right could achieve if allowed to proliferate in an ideal manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do appreciate your detailed writeups. I like having these sorts of conversations. Feels like I&#39;m bridging a gap of sorts.</p>

<p>Religion had its chance for thousands of years. It brought us the crusades and the dark ages.</p>

<p>One is based on blind faith with no hard evidence. This same one also ignores forms of hard evidence that may go against its dogmatic teachings. This same one also adheres to a dogmatic book (depending on which one) that lays out the rules and leaves no room for fundamental change based on evidence and established fact.</p>

<p>The other is based heavily on evidence. This same one does not adhere to any specific dogmatic book, or any worship or any single specific teaching. This one has a due process that leads to positive or negative results. This one is entirely open and ready for any change that may come its way as a result of experimentation, testing and examination of new evidence.</p>

<p>Which is which?</p>

<p>The state of the world today sucks. Sure, I&#39;ll give you that. But that doesn&#39;t mean science and all scientists suck. The reality is the majority of scientists in general are good people with open minds to all sorts of possibilities.</p>

<p>One asks for evidence.</p>

<p>The other asks for blind faith and demands you ignore evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Feels like I&#39;m bridging a gap of sorts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is always good, for unity is the resting place of all things which seem multifarious in their initial appearance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion had its chance for thousands of years. It brought us the crusades and the dark ages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are limited by a blind adherence to western dogmatism.  As such and taken from this perspective, you are correct.  Fortunately, however, this perspective is quite shallow in its breadth, and applies not one whit to most perspectives in the East.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One is based on blind faith with no hard evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You make the statement which I initially quoted above in this response here, and then you betray its stated intention with a comment such as this one that is ignorant of the greater scope within which those oldest religions are based of which it seems you have little understanding.  There is nothing wrong with ignorance - we all have much of it and I certainly am far ahead of the pack in many respects - but when you do not see the ignorance which you hold is such and mistakenly assume that it is actually knowledge you are looking at, then your mindset plummets into a state of dark hubris from which enlightenment is considerably more difficult.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This same one also ignores forms of hard evidence that may go against its dogmatic teachings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those which you might be familiar with.  Sure.  As already stated, religion as it is practiced here leaves <em>much</em> to be desired.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This same one also adheres to a dogmatic book (depending on which one) that lays out the rules and leaves no room for fundamental change based on evidence and established fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unfortunate that it seems you continue exclusively equating the whole of religion in general with one young, particularly limited, exclusivist form of it.  This is typically Western, but, unfortunately, not critical or very aware of the reality of things.  I mean no foul upon you, but we cannot go very far in this conversation if you insist upon allowing your mind to remain limited by the mistaken notion that the type of religion you continue referring to here is the only (or most important) type of religion there is.</p>

<p>Mind you I am not disagreeing with much of what you say with regard to the one variant of the religion that you are referring to.  However, and again, you make the grave mistake of confusing one, tiny, very soluble drop of rain with the entire ocean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other is based heavily on evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it is certainly very good that you did not use the adjective &quot;exclusively&quot;, there are enough examples to call into question the veracity of even the adjective which you did use here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This same one does not adhere to any specific dogmatic book, or any worship or any single specific teaching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet here again one will find a discrepancy between this particular statement and the observable facts if one but look deeply and closely enough into the inner workings of this society and in the manner that - as already stated more than once - scientific truth regularly suffers at the hands of corporate (read dogmatic) power (read worship).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This one has a due process that leads to positive or negative results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not certain how &quot;due&quot; it is, unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This one is <em>entirely</em> open and ready for <em>any</em> change that may come its way as a result of experimentation, testing and examination of new evidence.  [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unfortunate that I feel I have to continue to preface some of my statements with &quot;please don&#39;t take this as any afront against you...&quot; but it seems that you have a lot of work to do in the area of broadening your selective awareness and focus.  Do you not recall the examples I&#39;ve already given directly contradicting this very statement?  We really cannot move forward much if at all until and unless statements like this one are directly addressed and the various examples (of the many that exist) going very much against what you&#39;re stating here are settled.  I say this because, if they are <em>not</em> settled, then you will simply continue stating &quot;blue&quot; and I will continue stating &quot;green&quot; and the impasse will likely prove insurmountable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is which?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is both valid and invalid depending upon the perspective one takes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The state of the world today sucks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that doesn&#39;t mean science and all scientists suck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither did I day anything of the sort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reality is the majority of scientists in general are good people with open minds to all sorts of possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this is the case.  Such also applies to more religious individuals than most westerners realize or would ever give credit to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One asks for evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other asks for blind faith and demands you ignore evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, which is which?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is both valid and invalid depending upon the perspective one takes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3:20am, sorry if this is not entirely legible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel you communicated quite well, sir.  Apologies if some of what I said has come across as too cross.  I don&#39;t see a reason why our current disagreement need devolve into anything too harsh, and I apologize if my responses have seemed such.</p>
