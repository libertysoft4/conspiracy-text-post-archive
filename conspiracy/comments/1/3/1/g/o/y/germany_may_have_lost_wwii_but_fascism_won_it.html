<blockquote>
<p>“I have been just as furious as you at the compilation of lies which the communist and Semitic elements of our government have leveled against me and practically every other commander. In my opinion it is a deliberate attempt to alienate the soldier vote from the commanders, because the communists know that soldiers are not communistic, and they fear what eleven million votes (of veterans) would do.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is my present thought . . . that when I finish this job, which will be around the first of the year, I shall resign, not retire, because if I retire I will still have a gag in my mouth . . . I should not start a limited counterattack, which would be contrary to my military theories, but should wait until I can start an all-out offensive . . . .”</p>

<p>I only did see the half of documentary because i was falling asleep lol but the documentary is pretty much about the IRS,FED,New World Order,9/11 (Nick Rockefeller told Aaron Russo that 9/11 will happen and it did.)</p>

<p>illegal Wars,False Flag Operation&#39;s (9/11,[...]),Racial Propaganda (these bad muslim&#39;s),SS = TSA Viper team&#39;s,Concentration Camps = FEMA Camps,<a href="http://www.saveamericafoundation.com/2012/10/19/obama-fema-corp-recruits-conjure-up-memories-of-the-hitler-youth-of-1930s-germany/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SaveAmericaFoundation+%28Save+America+Foundation%29">Hitler Youth</a>, Mainstream Media = Reporting with questioning = propaganda,Operation Paperclip, there is much more....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No Problem </p>

<p>here are 5 points to 9/11:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://investigate911.org/">There was Nano-Thermite found in the remains of the WTC</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwXgiLXj_8Y">The Passport&#39;s of the &quot;Hijacker&#39;s&quot; survived the explosion from the WTC and the Plane and was found by the FBI.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=ctr9rA4d88c">Dick Cheney gave NORAD the order to stand down on 9/11</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNsJJYl8VAw&amp;amp;feature=related">BBC and FOX are reporting the WTC 7 Collapse before it happens</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://infowars.net/articles/february2007/250207Hijackers.htm">9/11 &quot;Hijacker&#39;s&quot; was trained at U.S Bases</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sure the TSA isn&#39;t at the moment so bad like the SS. (okay even the SS didn&#39;t touch childern like the TSA does)
What the TSA is doing now is acclimatation that it is okay to let goverment touch you, and be obident to them.</p>

<p>The TSA is &quot;ready to go&quot; if a collapse happens you understand this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay its complex so i try to make it simple.</p>

<p>the plan is a New World Order (If you don&#39;t undertsand this term say it please).</p>

<p>You see that the police state,tyranny is growing right?</p>

<p>there will be tipping point when the people start seeing this (i hope).</p>

<p>A major event like a Iran Attack,Financial Collapse brings Martial Law now the goverment gets highjacked by a dictator (funded by the globalists) or even obama (He is funded by the Globalists too).</p>

<p>Now he will be Hitler 2.0 and sends some muslim&#39;s into FEMA Camp&#39;s for Propaganda (Skip this step for fianical collapse).</p>

<p>Now Everbody that is resisting the dictatorship is labeld &quot;terrorist&quot; and straight into the FEMA Camp.</p>

<p>Its pretty much the same thing like Nazi Germany,this also no conecindence the same powers that fund Hitler are controlling the USA.</p>

<p>Your next Question will probably be who is doing this right?</p>

<p>Its the illuminati bloodline major family&#39;s of these bloodlines are the Rockefeller,Rothschild [...].</p>

<p>How can they do something like that?</p>

<p>They are doing this trough different Groups like the CFR,Trilateral Commision,Bilderberg,Skull &amp; Bones[...].</p>

<p>They are holding the key position&#39;s in goverment&#39;s (reason why they could do 9/11).</p>

<p>If you have questions ask them but i don&#39;t have all answer&#39;s nobody does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be the fastest way to complete a New World Order, if they are really doing it that way i don&#39;t know it would maybe to many people wake up.
Hitler did have the same goal.(Like i before said he is also sponsored by them.)</p>

<p>That the Illuminati existed is mainstream its more the question if they are still existing.
George Washington did write about there existing.
There are People like Bill Schnoebele who are Whistleblower on this subject.</p>

<p>Also there logo is on the backside of the 1 dollar bill. All seeing Eye at the top means  they are those who are enlightened. The text in latein &quot;novo ordo seclorum&quot; ranslates a new world order.
There is so much Symbolism on the bill i could go here also for hours.
They are a real &quot;Secret Society&quot; so you don&#39;t know who,when,what.</p>

<p>But the Point is there are &quot;Secret Society&#39;s&quot; like Bilderberg,Skull &amp; Bones,Bohemian Grove, where you can&#39;t deny there existing and influence.</p>

<p>When you wan&#39;t proof for the other &quot;Secret Socitey&#39;s&quot; ask me specific i can&#39;t list everthing and do your research.</p>

<p>Ask me if you have other questions.</p>

Big money, the ultra wealthy elite run the show and make sure that anyone who tries to change it (Abraham Lincoln, John F Kennedy ) get whacked , look it up we are ran by central banking and gave up those powers in 1913 and it has spread colonialism around the world. Ask yourself why the US would be friendly to a dictator and hand out billions of dollars ? Because its just paper, it is not real money its an IOU for the real money , gold. That is how banks got started they issued their own paper. Under one control however they are dangerous. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNNeVu8wUak">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNNeVu8wUak</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascism was utterly destroyed in Germany, it is no more than a minor ideology in Germany now and opposed by modern Germans. Italy got rid of its fascists and again is not a popular philosophy. There are no fascist governments ruling upon Europe, they literally have no political power. Greece has a large movement as does Hungary, but there aren&#39;t any fascist governments so I would argue that Carlin was wrong in this respect, unless I am missing the point.</p>

<p>Can someone describe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Fascism is an authoritarian or totalitarian nationalist political ideology. Fascists seek to organize a nation according to corporatist perspectives, values, and systems, including the political system and the economy.&quot;</p>

<p>No nation currently is able to opporate under a fully autocratic rule. (with the possible exception of N Korea) However the corporatist ideaology of profit pushing, and neglegence towards resource conservation/preservation, is still very fascist, and is rampant not just in Europe, but America and everywhere else as well.</p>

<p>You have a very broad definition of fascism.  Look up American corporatism pre-WWI, before fascism ever existed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I have, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have commented on it. So yes I&#39;m fully aware of the claims he makes. But need I remind you that the particular book in question is not fiction and that project paper clip is not a theory. The ties to the former nazi regime are real events with real people. Of course I take everything win a grain of salt, but the point of the book is that the war did not crush the money that backed the nazis. Regaurding the sales of his books, what idiot in a capitalist economy would not try to sell their product? Obviously we don&#39;t see eye to eye. I respect the possibility that you may be correct about Jim Marrs, but that doesn&#39;t change history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got a different take from that book than you must have. From what I gathered it was about banks and corporations playing both sides of the war from the beginning. The same ones that are still playing the same games. Regardless of his personal convictions, I found this particular book very informative and quite the eye opener. To say that nazis run the US is retarded I agree. But a lot of nazi sympathizers benefited greatly from the war. To think that some of their ideals didn&#39;t seep into American business and politics would be naive.</p>

<p>A chilling report circulating in the Kremlin this afternoon released by the Aerospace Defence Forces (VKO) states that Kosmos 2479 detected the firing of two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles from a MQ-1 Predator drone yesterday being operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) over the United States city of Indianapolis that resulted in a massive explosion [photo 2nd left], and from local US media reports resulted in at least two deaths.</p>

<p>That satellite is <a href="http://www.satellite-calculations.com/Satellite/Catalog/catalogID.php?38101">located above the equator at 165.4°E</a>, which is over the Pacific, so the part of the Earth that it can see is <a href="http://imgur.com/YNaq6">this</a>.
