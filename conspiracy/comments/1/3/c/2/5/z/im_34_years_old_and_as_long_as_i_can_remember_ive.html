Almost everyone I know who gets this shot ends up really sick afterwards. As far as I understand it, you&#39;re basically being injected with a half-dead form of influenza, which makes people sick, because they&#39;re injecting you with the flu. </p>

<p>My wife was basically the same way, never gets flu shots, or the flu. But now that our unborn baby is in question, our soon-to-be baby doctor insists that it is the right thing to do, and my wife is on board. I say fuck that, which has caused an argument.</p>

<p>I obviously want what&#39;s best for my unborn child, but I refuse to buy into this flu-shot BS. Yet, I am at a loss as to how to convey this besides presenting my past experience and ideologies onto my wife with no real &quot;medical&quot; explanation. Can anyone prove me wrong or right either way in stating that I don&#39;t need this or want this and it will still be safe for my baby?</p>

<p>Am I wrong in thinking that my personal past experiences out-weigh this &quot;medical professional&quot; and his ideas? I really don&#39;t want to be ignorant about this.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: My daughter WILL BE getting all of her vaccinations, flu shot included. This post was about whether or not it is necessary for me to get the shot. This thread has sort of derailed into whether or not I should get my baby vaccinated, which was not my intent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>anecdotal evidence is meaningless. some percentage of the population won&#39;t get sick. vaccines aren&#39;t useless or poison, you just got lucky (or have selective memory). and all the people who told you they got sick? some are complainers, some DID get sick... because it&#39;s flu season! which is why they got a flu shot!</p>

<p>what if you got sick and passed on some shit that an old person or premature baby died from? what if your wife gets a nice fever and cooks your kid&#39;s brains? </p>

<p>your personal experience is totally misleading. scientists study thousands of people in order to get approval to inject something into patients. millions of rats die of terrible diseases in the process of inventing these vaccines. why would scientists get good grades in school where they learned how to make people immune to diseases, and then get a job murdering lab mice, in order to poison you? why would they knowingly do that? ...or do you think that all virologists are just stupider than you? if vaccines are bunk, why are smallpox or polio not around anymore?</p>

<p>Yes, the studies show that immunity is acquired through vaccination, but do we have studies where a group is not vaccinated and then they are compared to people who have been vaccinated, comparing the diseases they had the whole life?</p>

<p>I say the whole life because, in a sense, vaccination is unnatural immunization. </p>

<p>Yes, the body may develop antibodies to that specific illness, but let me make an analogy: it&#39;s making a test where all the answers are available to you.. You don&#39;t learn how to think about the problems. Same thing with vaccines... The body memorizes the response for the inactive pathogens, without going the full process. Of course it is kinda similar, but I just believe the organic way is better. And by the way, flu vaccines are useless, since you are vaccinating people to the pathogens of last year or so... As you may know, these mutate really fast.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure some of the diseases you cited were eliminated by vaccination. But as these guys do, it&#39;s a double effect.</p>

<p>You get the positive effect from the immunization but are pretty much forced to take all the crap they put in it, which is who-knows-what.</p>

<p>Just like water fluoridation, except that it is a lie instead of immunization(a nicely crafted one as a matter of fact). You say people are benefiting when really you are just messing with their brains.</p>

<p>edit: Vaccination is against natural selection itself. You are not selecting those who are stronger to fight the illness and simply getting everyone to the same level. There is a serious concern among doctors(my dad is one of them) with the use of antibiotics. Simply stepping into a hospital gives you exposure to some heavy artificially selected pathogens. In some 100 years, if society is the same as we know now, we will probably die of some super variant of a known pathogen, because of the artificial selection we have been making(again, intentional by the powers that be). You see ads about medicine everyday, and the propaganda makes you feel like you are always ill. I get a flu or a bad nose 1 time each 2 years. And I live a pretty bad lifestyle(smoking, drinking, not exercising, etc). It&#39;s all in your mind.

<p>you wrote a long thing and i want you to take my equally lengthy response as a sign that i genuinely want you to change your mind about this. so here we go:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Minamata disease (organic mercury poisoning) Neuroradiologic and electrophysiologic studies</p>

<p>Neurology [0028-3878] Tokuomi, H yr:1982 vol:32 iss:12 pg:1369</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Minamata disease  (MD), the world&#39;s  first mass methylmercury poisoning, was caused by ingestion of seafood from methylmercury-contaminated areas of Minamata Bay and the neighboring seas in Japan. In 1953, residents of that area first showed evidence  of  the  concentric constriction of  visual fields, hearing loss, tremors, cerebellar incoordination, and sensory impairment of the legs and arms or tongue  and lips...  ...For over 20 years, we carried out annual studies 
of the regional cases, paying special attention to new or shifting symptom. Recently, we  used CT, quantitative tremography,  and short latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what i take from this is that unless some non-negligible fraction of the vaccinated people you know are having tremors and tunnel vision and shit like that, there is no reason to jump to the conclusion that mercury from vaccines is causing any notable effects at all- particularly because ethylmercury from vaccine preservatives has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning#Ethylmercury">shorter half-life in the body</a> than the other form of organic mercury, methylmercury. since you haven&#39;t mentioned it i assume you aren&#39;t claiming that thimerosal causes autism; correct me if i&#39;m wrong on that though. it should be mentioned at this point that <a href="http://www2.tbo.com/lifestyles/life/2012/nov/18/study-links-autism-to-flu-fever-during-pregnancy-ar-568891/"> <em>maternal flu infection</em> has been linked to autism</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the studies show that immunity is acquired through vaccination, but do we have studies where a group is not vaccinated and then they are compared to people who have been vaccinated, comparing the diseases they had the whole life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you bring up an interesting point- why do we not allow participants in medical studies to be knowingly put in danger by investigators? you&#39;ll notice that minamata disease was named after a disaster where many people consumed methylmercury and the scientists were able to check back with them for years afterward. well, the current rules of science and medicine don&#39;t allow us to actively poison people with thimerosal or ethylmercury to see for sure if they&#39;re harmful or not. you can argue that we then shouldn&#39;t use them for preservatives, and in an ideal world i agree with you. if they could manufacture vaccines in real-time and without preservatives, that would be awesome and i would love to work together with you to make that possible in the future. and i won&#39;t even start with the problem of trying to study epidemiology in a vacuum considering the effects of herd immunity, as i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard before. </p>

<p>however, a problem arises when we misunderstand the biology involved:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I say the whole life because, in a sense, vaccination is unnatural immunization. Yes, the body may develop antibodies to that specific illness, but let me make an analogy: it&#39;s making a test where all the answers are available to you.. You don&#39;t learn how to think about the problems. Same thing with vaccines... The body memorizes the response for the inactive pathogens, without going the full process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>your analogy isn&#39;t quite right. the way vaccines work is that they introduce your immune system to what a pathogen looks like (provide examples of bacterial or viral proteins) so that your immune system can alert the B-cell population that expresses the correct antibodies to develop immunity. this is possible because your body has a ridiculously huge combination of antibodies that can be made through hypermutation of the part of the antibody that binds to the antigen. so <em>from birth</em> you already have the ability to fight ANY disease! (&quot;your brain is plenty smart&quot; in your analogy), it&#39;s only a matter of increasing the correct antibody-producing cell population quickly enough, before the pathogen hurts or kills you, and spreads to everyone around you. that&#39;s where vaccines come in- by introducing your immune system to the antigen independently of the disease-causing replicating element, when you actually encounter the disease you don&#39;t get super sick because your immune system is primed to make the right antibody immediately. it&#39;s all a matter of how fast antibodies can be made, and vaccinations speed up that process.</p>

<p>so the correct analogy isn&#39;t a test with all the answers, it&#39;s actually a test where we give your body time to figure out the right answer without the threat posed by actively replicating bacteria or viruses. that&#39;s what they mean by &quot;attenuated&quot; vaccines- the pathogen is irradiated or otherwise undermined so your body can win easily. other vaccines are completely dead, so there is no risk of getting sick.</p>

<p>this means that there is no difference in the process of recognizing an antigen and producing an antibody between a real and induced response, from your body&#39;s point of view (adjuvants aside). it&#39;s not cheating, or making your immune system &quot;lazy&quot;. it doesn&#39;t work like that (because all possible antibodies already exist in your B-cells, they just hypermutate to fit whatever antigen they happen to encounter).</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course it is kinda similar, but I just believe the organic way is better. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the &quot;organic&quot; way is not better, it&#39;s much worse because you could be killed, or give the virus a chance to mutate and re-assort to become much worse. you could even spread the virus to a fragile baby or old person who then dies. so clearly, vaccines which can&#39;t replicate or mutate are much better than live viruses, which can.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassortment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassortment</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And by the way, flu vaccines are useless, since you are vaccinating people to the pathogens of last year or so... As you may know, these mutate really fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as i just mentioned, the quick mutation of influenza is one more reason in favor of immunizing people, so they don&#39;t create a billion new viral particles that can mutate while their immune systems are being introduced to the pathogen. slow turnover of vaccines and centralized production are both infrastructural shortcomings that we should <em>fix</em> so that we can make  <em>better</em> vaccines, not give up on vaccination altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure some of the diseases you cited were eliminated by vaccination. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>both of the two diseases i cited, polio and smallpox, were eradicated through vaccination campaigns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But as these guys do, it&#39;s a double effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there are several problems with this statement. firstly, if you want to claim that we are being deliberately poisoned, you should support that claim with some evidence. i&#39;m not saying rich fucks aren&#39;t happy to get some incidental worker drone brain damage or low sperm counts out of the deal, but we need evidence if we&#39;re to believe that this benefit is the primary driving force behind vaccinations, rather than the millions of scientists around the world who like you and want you to enjoy a long and joyful existence on this planet, free from shitty diseases like <a href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/27232352">diphtheria.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You get the positive effect from the immunization but are pretty much forced to take all the crap they put in it, which is who-knows-what.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i am all for transparency and thorough study. i also believe that the people who design the vaccines and dose out the preservatives in the factories would raise a huge stink if someone were forcing them to overdose everyone (including the factory workers&#39; kids) with mercury. if you would be willing to support vaccination as long as there is no mercury, let&#39;s agree to build more decentralized vaccination infrastructure that would allow us to response quickly to new strains AND would allow less preservatives to be needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just like water fluoridation, except that it is a lie instead of immunization(a nicely crafted one as a matter of fact). You say people are benefiting when really you are just messing with their brains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>again, we need evidence of this. fluoridation is a different issue and i am supportive of letting the consumer decide how they want to consume fluoride or not, since it&#39;s only their teeth vs. nervous system at risk. but with infectious diseases everyone is put at risk by individuals allowing themselves to act as vectors to spread infection. simply put, people who don&#39;t vaccinate themselves end up causing real harm to others. it&#39;s not like you can control how many viruses to excrete when you&#39;re sick. you just spread viruses everywhere you go! and if some of those viruses happened to have mutated or re-assorted, you could be the cause of the next global pandemic. that&#39;s really bad.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think you&#39;re seriously suggesting that we should let people die as a form of evolution. the spanish flu of 1918 killed off the people with the strongest immune systems by creating a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tissue samples from frozen victims were used to reproduce the virus for study. This research concluded, among other things, that the virus kills through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body&#39;s immune system), which perhaps explains its unusually severe nature and the concentrated age profile of its victims. The strong immune system reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic</a></p>

<p>as the masters of this planet, i think that&#39;s a shitty way to decide how we proceed as a species. try to imagine how you would feel if you lost one or many of your loved ones due to some random, stupid reason like spreading virus particles, and then someone tells you that they&#39;re happy we&#39;re evolving because of it! it&#39;s a tragic and undignified reason to let people die, especially when we can do better than that. if you want to discuss eugenics we can do that, but pandemics are a needlessly cruel way to potentiate human evolution.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>antibiotics are not specific. if vaccines are heatseeking missiles, antibiotics are landmines. when bacteria figure out a path through the minefield, we&#39;re fucked. but with vaccines we can always specify what to go after and kill. antibiotic resistance is a big problem, that i think we can agree to find ways to solve. it is an issue completely separate from vaccination though. it would be cool to hear your dad&#39;s take on this, btw!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You see ads about medicine everyday, and the propaganda makes you feel like you are always ill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>propaganda is a big problem, also completely separate from arguments about the validity of immunization as a public health strategy. i&#39;m a believer in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDW_Hj2K0wo">bill hicks</a> when it comes to advertising.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get a flu or a bad nose 1 time each 2 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that could be a result of your lifestyle, innate immunity, or just dumb luck. it is not valid to draw global conclusions from a sample size of 1. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I live a pretty bad lifestyle(smoking, drinking, not exercising, etc). It&#39;s all in your mind. The mind has the power to control every aspect of your body(read the AMA with the guy that didn&#39;t breathe for 25ish minutes or so).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if your mind controls everything so that a bad lifestyle doesn&#39;t matter, why stress about mercury? why do you care if people get vaccinated when it&#39;s all mind-over-matter anyway?</p>

<p>i&#39;ve tried to be as respectful and collaborative as possible (and spent my entire night on this), because i have personally witnesses plates of cells suffering from and protected from viruses. i&#39;ve studied epidemiological history, and even my username is a viral reference. i&#39;ve met the people who are currently devoting their lives to finding out the truth about pandemics, and i know that those people would raise hell if they caught wind of any shenanigans. they&#39;re not unobservant people either! all these things lead me to believe that vaccines are good. the parasite class can and should hang, but let&#39;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. let&#39;s have a class war and lynch the fucking bilderbergs, but let&#39;s do it directly. anti-vaccination is just shooting us all in the collective foot.</p>

<p>if you have any questions or want to discuss anything in more depth, i will make time to get us all on the same page. similarly, if you find sources that you think are compelling and would change my mind on this, i will read them with gusto! i want us both to find the truth, whatever that may be. for example, as a result of my research for this reply, i was reminded of how nasty mercury really is. i&#39;m sure we&#39;re motivated by the same good intentions, and i just want the bad guys to get theirs without all of us getting fuckin&#39; bird flu in the process! ;D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is basically a half dead version of the flu, it trains your body to make anti-bodies for it, so you will be immune to the real thing should you encounter it.</p>

<p>Being a half dead flu, there is a <em>possibility</em> it will make you kind of sick. But it is a lot better than getting full-throttled flu.</p>

<p>Statistically your baby probably won&#39;t get sick and probably won&#39;t get the flu. But there is no way to actually know that. The doctor has probably seen babies that have become horribly sick with the flu, and maybe even died or know some who died. They only see the sick babies and go home every day frustrated, wondering why people won&#39;t just get them vaccinated.</p>

<p>Babies don&#39;t have the immunity an adult does, if they do get it, they can die or become mentally retarded.</p>

<p>My dad never got any shots when he was a kid, and got sick with every 1950s disease you can think of besides polio. He kind of made up for it with me. I always had flu shots, tetanus, rabies, polio, hepatitis a and b, and never had a bad reaction to any of them.</p>

<p>I have encountered a rabid animal once, and was also stung by a sting ray (which apparently gives you tetanus) and didn&#39;t receive medical attention from either of those. I attribute myself not getting rabies or tetanus completely to vaccines I got.</p>

<p>rabies?!?  Um, your Dad is pretty crazy.  Your chance of dying from rabies in the United States is incredibly tiny, even if you live in a rural area - the average is much less than one American in <em>one hundred million</em> per year dead from rabies.</p>

<p>You&#39;re far more likely to die falling in the shower, or being hit by lightning.  Worse, you&#39;re more likely to die due to complications from the vaccine - that&#39;s a one in a million chance, but that still makes it a hundred times more likely than getting the actual disease!</p>

<p>An ethical doctor should not be giving people rabies vaccine unless they believe there&#39;s a good chance that that person has been exposed to the disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure everyone will call me a shill for this, but here it goes anyways.  I work at a hospital, not directly with patients, but I&#39;m in and out of doctor&#39;s offices all day.  I&#39;ve never had the flu shot before working here, but they offer it for free to employees, so I got it so I wouldn&#39;t bring it home to my kids.  I&#39;ve had it twice, did not get sick afterwards.  The shot is a dead virus, the nasal mist is a live virus.  This is where the conception that the flu &quot;shot&quot; makes you sick comes from, the nasal one actually can.  </p>

<p>As for the results, obviously it&#39;s very anecdotal, but I&#39;ll tell you my experience.  I&#39;ve only had it two seasons, this being my second.  Last flu season my SO, two kids, and SO&#39;s mom all got very sick with the flu for several days and I was perfectly fine the whole time I was taking care of them (none of them got the shot). Obviously me getting the shot didn&#39;t help them in this case, but it potentially could have.  It&#39;s also possible that because of the shot I didn&#39;t get the flu in this case, but there&#39;s probably not really any way to prove that except by determining what strain my family had and what strain I was inoculated with.</p>

<p>So there it is, some guy on the internet says it helped him, take it or leave it. Good luck on your decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, one of these things is not like the other.</p>

<p>The polio vaccine is extremely effective, which is excellent because getting polio has an extremely good chance of either killing or crippling you. </p>

<p>The flu vaccine is not nearly as effective - and in fact since the vaccine they give you is a guess about the next year&#39;s flu, there&#39;s a pretty good chance it&#39;ll be worthless - but on the other hand millions of people get the flu every year and only a tiny percentage of them die of it.</p>

<p>It is possible for reasonable people to decide not to get vaccinated against the flu.  You would, however, be deeply irresponsible not to have your kid vaccinated against polio...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, I have never had a flu shot, and spent a good 25 years of my life never having the flu. </p>

<p>Then I ended up getting the flu (well actually it was swine flu) a few years back, and I tell you this. as a fully grown adult male in relatively good health, it fucked me up. BADLY. I mean I was in bed for 2 weeks, everything hurt a lot, I was constantly dizzy going in and out of consciousness,  I didn&#39;t have the energy to do <em>anything</em> (even fap), for those 2 weeks I was confused, and unable to think properly. It was hard to eat or breathe, getting out of bed to go to the toilet was a mission, driving was pretty much out of the question. I managed to get the energy to go to the doctors 2 days into it and the nurse that took my nose swab was wearing gloves and a mask, and they even threw the pen I used to sign a consent form into the bin. </p>

<p>Now if I was a baby with the only immunological protection available being antibodies in my mothers breastmilk (note: this is something that will never be available in baby formula, and if it is advertised then it will simply be a chemical that &#39;tricks tests&#39; more than it provides real protection like some protein supplements), then I would probably be dead. My body felt so shit during that time that on many occasions I wondered if I was actually going to die.</p>

<p>I happen to work closely with a few research immunologists, and I do have great faith in many  vaccines, they do work, and there is solid science and years of field evidence that they do work extremely well (see: smallpox, polio, tetanus)</p>

<p>Even live virus vaccines are pretty damn safe. some people have reactions, quite often they are allergic to some of the compounds used in them (this is more common in synthetic vaccines than &#39;low-tech&#39; ones. ).</p>

<p>Now the &#39;seasonal flu vaccines&#39; (and the cervical cancer vaccine falls into this boat too simply because it was such a huge discovery, although statistically less people have had &#39;side effects&#39; from it than would have ended up with the cancer which makes it a safer roll of the dice, but I digress) are a slightly different story, they tend to get &#39;rushed&#39; out the door a little bit quicker. Instead of years of animal trials, then years of human trials before being declared safe for use the seasonal flu vaccines are &#39;fast tracked&#39; through the approvals process because of the fact that there is almost always a new variation of the flu every year, some cells end up in a lab, and work on the vaccine begins only a matter of months before it starts spreading through the public on a large scale.</p>

<p>so in regards to your future baby I would say, its your decision, to make a informed choice, In my personal opinion the flu can fuck you up seriously, above all else breast feed your baby since formula will not even pretend to give protection against something like this.</p>

<p>if you are to use any &#39;information&#39; especially if you find it online make sure its from a peer reviewed paper or medical journal (note: there is no anti-vaccine articles that stand up to scientific scrutiny, most dont even try, and those that do quite often get retracted after publication) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here and the CDC does not guarantee it works with everyone. There are many factors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Does the flu vaccine work the same for everyone?</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. While the flu vaccine is the single best way to prevent the flu, protection can vary widely, depending on who is being vaccinated (in addition to how well matched the vaccine viruses are with circulating viruses). In general, the flu vaccine works best among young healthy adults and older children. Some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses might develop less immunity than healthy young adults after vaccination. However, even for these people, the flu vaccine still may provide some protection.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm</a>)</p>

<p>So even though you gave a credible source from the NEJoM the CDC is the final authority.</p>

<p>For the flu vaccine to work it needs a similarity or &quot;match&quot; between the influenza viruses in the vaccine and those spreading in the community, and that&#39;s hard to predict on the 100&#39;s of strains out there. It&#39;s basically a roll of the dice as they make the medicine based on last years virus strain, and not the current one spreading.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a better idea, about 100 healthy children die every year from the flu, moreso die if they are otherwise immuno-compromised in some fashion, there are literally thousands of ways for that to occur that likely you and your doctor have not tested for every single possible genetic and physiological marker to determine all possibilities.
I would recommend not coming to random subreddits with next to zero medical background, and going over to <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a> where there are literally hundreds of people with medical knowledge who are there gladly to help. If you don&#39;t understand why you being vaccinated helps your child, look up herd immunity, though I assume you likely/should know what that is already anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got my first flu shot ever yesterday because I kept hearing how bad the flu is this year. I feel totally fine. I&#39;ve never in my life had a flu shot before and only got the flu once. The one time that I had it was insanely horrible. I was throwing up out both ends at the same time, yes literally. The flu vaccine can you make you sick but will never be as bad as the real thing. Also if you&#39;re healthy, you should only &quot;need&quot; to get it every 3-5 years. If your baby is getting it&#39;s flu-shots then there is no benefit to her if you get yours. For your sake though, you probably should.</p>

<p>As a non-professional, I&#39;d guess that your first flu-shot might make you pretty sick since you&#39;ve never had the flu or shot in your 34years of life. But it&#39;d still be far better than getting the actual flu. In the end, it&#39;s your dice and your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my reading on this issue, I agree that flu shots are completely pointless for people with normal immune systems, and that most flu shots are a waste of time and money (and that Big Pharm deliberately pushes them).</p>

<p>However, they do appear to be useful for people with weak immune systems - they being the very old, the very young, and people with diseases like AIDS.</p>

<p>So consider doing it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it&#39;s not at all clear that it&#39;s tremendously effective - they&#39;re shooting at a target long before the target appears, a good chunk of the time you are ending up immunized for the wrong disease.  So if you DON&#39;T do it, don&#39;t worry.</p>

<p>I am not so ambiguous when it comes to measles, mumps, polio, diphtheria, TB and such.  These are proven killers with millions of victims.  You&#39;re generally protected by &quot;herd immunity&quot; but each person who doesn&#39;t immunize diminishes this immunity.  When it comes to the real killers, you&#39;re irresponsible if you don&#39;t get vaccinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay okay I will try to be nice.. first off, anyone that you know who thinks they got sick from the flu shot was either already in the early stages of being sick when they received the shot or became sick before the vaccine created an effective immunity. Usually takes up to 2 weeks for your body to build up the antibodies. This causes the person to think that the flu shot made them sick when in reality they were already sick to begin with making the flu vaccine essentially useless. This is a common piece of misinformation.. this &quot;flu shot makes you sick&quot; concept is complete bullshit. The flu vaccine is created using dead virus&#39;s that are incapable of giving you the actual flu. They merely trick your body into making flu antibodies without actually having the flu. In reality, when you look at the hard facts and actual science, this is a proven lie. Now that that&#39;s out of the way, lets go into answering your questions.</p>

<p>Get the flu vaccine, be a good parent. Is it really that hard? You are wrong in thinking that your personal past experiences out weighs the medical professionals advice on getting the flu vaccine. Do you know how to differentiate a flu from a cold? Unless you are like the guy from Unbreakable, you are at risk of catching the flu. Do not even try to convince yourself that you are immune. Why do you believe the flu shot is absolute bullshit? Vaccines are proven to be effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know a lot of people who have died from the flu?  When I was a kid &quot;the flu&quot; meant a break from school accompanied by drinking lots of ginger ale, vomitting and shitting your body clean, and then puking up said gingerale only to drink more so you didn&#39;t have to retch bile.  Also... Ghostbusters, Labrynth, Cartoons, the Disney Anthology.  Then when it&#39;s all over... you go back to not having any problems again.  I&#39;ve had the flu MAYBE twice.  it&#39;s been yeeeeeeeeeeeears since I&#39;ve gotten sick.  At least two decades.
I have subscribed to other vaccines however... the hangnail vaccine, mosquito bite vaccine, general itch vaccine, runny nose vaccine, and &quot;gamers thumb&quot; vaccine.  I&#39;ve found them all very unnaffective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the amount of adverse data about the pharma companies making vaccines, I refuse them. In one case in particular their quality control was so bad that the doses were contaminated with other microorganisms and delivered diseases. I prefer to do proper avoidance regimens like cleaning my hands after being in public touching things (keeping wipes in my car), and staying the hell away from people with terrible hygiene.  I haven&#39;t had a cold or the flu now for years. But not everyone can be lucky either.</p>

<p>PS   I always wash my hands after coming home, maybe this helps control skin-borne contamination..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually thought about this for some time and the best way I can explain why not to get the flu shot is the fact that if anyone were to tamper with it before it was shipped out into the mass population it could cause a pandemic.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had some sort of flu a couple times when I was in my teens but not since then (you and I are the same age). I had one flu shot in my 20&#39;s but after I felt sluggish for a couple days afterward I started thinking about it from a statistics standpoint. </p>

<ul>
<li>I haven&#39;t had the flu in years.</li>
<li>I am healthy.</li>
<li>99% of the people at work are getting the flu shot.</li>
<li>The chances of getting the flu are really slim in that almost everyone I spend the most time with has had the flu shot.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I&#39;ve never gotten the flu shot again and neither has my family. Even when it was &quot;recommended&quot; by doctors and when a Major tried to force it on myself and other enlisted who didn&#39;t want it (that is a story in itself). </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories or not, I just don&#39;t like feeling bad after I get it, and giving it to an infant when you already know how temperamental they can be isn&#39;t worth it at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked at a chain drug store as a pharmacy tech (within the last 2 years) and they push flu shots so hard it is crazy. You have to answer the phone every time starting with &#39;Have you got you flu shot yet?&quot; and ask every customer every time you see them, starting months ahead of &#39;flu season&#39; and ask them to sign up for an appointment. Corporate even has you go as a far as going down a list cold calling people on the phone number on their file to ask if they have gotten it yet or ask for an appointment. </p>

<p>I floated from store to store and had to say that I had already had my shot from a previous store to avoid being hounded by the pharmacists trying to give me one. They turn it into a competition and keep marks of which pharmacists in which stores have the overall highest number of shots given.</p>

<p>But they are dangerous, not all of the vaccines, but some are very dangerous and cause chronic illness later on, some give the virus they are supposed to protect you against, some cause brain damage and lower intellect and some are outright not working, as in its pretty much a whitewash that doesn&#39;t protect you. </p>

<p>That said is it better to get this one specific vaccines? Who knows. I mean you need to read the insert on the bottle and consult with an chemistry experts because those are the people that actually know the compounds, while doctors are just brainwashed what to think by the federal government through the education indoctrination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that 90% of the flu shots given are pointlessly wasted on people with normal immune systems, and you&#39;re right to be skeptical.</p>

<p>But if you look at what the world was like before vaccination, you find that an astonishing percentage of people died in childhood of diseases we consider minor today - things like mumps and measles - and countless others were crippled by things like polio.</p>

<p>For example, ever read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;?  It was written in 1943 about growing up in the US in the 1910s.  The writer points out that kids died of communicable diseases <em>every year</em> in her classes.  I grew up 50 years later and not a single person I ever knew died of a communicable disease in grade school or high school...</p>

<p>My grandfather lived in Australia and used to be a specialist in treating TB - which was a huge affliction when he was young.  Before he retired, he had to switch to general pulmonary medicine because vaccination had made TB so rare that he could no longer earn a living.</p>

<p>By the way, they haven&#39;t used heavy metals in vaccines since they stopped using thimerosal in 1999.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I should add that I&#39;ve been called a &quot;shill&quot; numerous times here - which is a hoot, since in regular company I&#39;m considered total radical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a key point. We may not be able to convince the television zombies that make up most of the general population that vaccinations are bad, but we can benefit personally from their collective stupidity. Because so many drones get shots, you or I don&#39;t need to get them -- the diseases are not in circulation. By not getting the shots or not giving them to our children, we avoid the possible negative side effects of vaccinations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the Doc wants you to get vaccinated is because as a healthy adult, you can carry the flu virus (and maybe only think you have a minor cold etc) and pass it onto your newborn. You wife would need to be carrying the flu to pass antibodies on to the baby via breastmilk also. SO..a new baby with the flu is NOT a pretty sight..I got the flu when my baby was 10 weeks old(for the first time in 15 years), then passed it onto her. We both went to hospital but came out fine..Flu and/or bronchiolitis in newborns can cause asthma, pneumonia and general susceptibility to lung infections for years.</p>

<p>The fact is, whether we agree or not on vaccination..nature will decide who dies from what ultimately, and despite survival rates being better than ever before, it is still only the strong who survive. Breastfeed the baby, keep her away from crowds and other children for at least 6 weeks to allow her immune system to start functioning....these things are great ways to protect her from illness.</p>

<p>Lastly...a tiny vaccination for you won&#39;t really hurt if it&#39;s to protect your baby? 
However you decide...I wish you all the best for your new arrival!   :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to you (and all) for the replies, but I think I may not have been clear enough in my OP.</p>

<p>First, I&#39;m having a daughter. Secondly, my wife and I plan on having ALL her vaccinations, even if the flu shot is included.</p>

<p>When my wife met with our soon-to-be pediatrician, he recommended her and I get the shot. This is where I&#39;m bringing this to question, whether I need the shot in order to not potentially affect my child&#39;s health. This is what does not make sense to me, especially if the baby is getting the shot anyway.</p>

<p>Sorry if I was unclear initially, but some of these replies seem to be taking a strong turn in the wrong direction.</p>
