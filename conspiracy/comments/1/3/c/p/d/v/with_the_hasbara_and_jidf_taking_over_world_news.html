        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While I don&#39;t always agree with the all the view presented in this sub (probably like the rest of you!),I know you guys here can see through the bullshit... I am in the fairly unique position of having seen Palestine with my own eyes, It pains me so much to see Reddit being swayed so heavily by external negative forces. Their method is powerful and effective and through coordination they are hijacking all real debate and swaying public opinion en-masse. How can we reduce the power of their tactics, or/and convince Reddit that this is a state sponsored  coordinated propaganda strike?</p>

<p>P.S.  I am convinced by the truth using primary, secondary and tertiary sources. This is one of the worlds biggest injustices. </p>

<p>Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza</p>

<p>Edit: This is wider than Just Hasbara and JIDF. It should be Hasbara and JIDF, et al.</p>

<p>Edit: In no way am I saying that all comments and posts that oppose my stance are a part of this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hasbara refers to the propaganda efforts to improve Israel&#39;s image abroad, to justify its actions, and defend it in world opinion. It is a public diplomacy effort undertaken by Israeli government officers, or individuals in target countries (public or private efforts; group or individual efforts). Israel portrays itself as fighting on two fronts: against the Palestinians/Arabs and world opinion. The latter is dealt with hasbara. The premise of hasbara is that Israel&#39;s problems are a matter of better propaganda, and not one of an underlying unjust situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think at this point in time there is no direct written/solid evidence that will prove my case of what is happening in subreddits. Giving you specific examples of comments in other subs will only lead to conjecture, because they will be just my opinion and in no way evidence. 
How I have derived at my conclusion on this matter is based on looking over the default subs and seeing the change in &#39;hivemind&#39; from light spatterings of pro-Israeli sentiment to the polar opposite. </p>

<p>This is completely anecdotal, but I&#39;m reaching out to other people who may also see this emerging... Maybe it is just me. </p>

<p>While the JIDF and other Israeli-owned propaganda machines are indeed very powerful and utterly control most social outlets, at least with Reddit <em>everyone</em> can get the word out about what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>When comments such as this one are removed by mods THEN you will know that the JIDF has achieved their mission goals.</p>

<p>Beware, with their latest incursion into Gaza to steal yet MORE land from the beaten-down Palestinians in their concentration camps the JIDF will be hard at work in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I have seen Israel&#39;s terror, both to Arabs and anyone that is not an Ashkenazi, with my own eyes. In the long run, they will not win.</p>

<p>Israel is setting themselves up to be destroyed. American Jews have to recognize that what they are doing &quot;in their name&quot; is purely terrorism, plain and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you give propaganda too much credit.  Most of the propaganda I&#39;ve seen on Reddit lately was to support a regime change in Syria.   The propaganda was seen through (as with Libya) because the information and arguments did not stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>Again, we can discuss all the points here and it becomes obvious that most people think firing rockets indiscriminately into israel is a very stupid thing to do - unless you want that kind of response, then it&#39;s very irresponsible and someone should protect the gazan&#39;s from their leaders - apparently  bent on sacrificing them for political gain.</p>

<p>I think you give propaganda too much credit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re not sufficiently aware of it.  Israel might likely be wiped off the map if the world (and especially America) were more aware of what is <em>really</em> going on over there.  And why aren&#39;t they?  Because of the very MSM propaganda machine that 1) the Zionists own, 2) pretty much controls and manipulates a great portion of public opinion, 3) maintains a tight grip on the Zionist-controlled military industrial complex of the U.S., and 4) you mistakenly say I give too much credit to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the propaganda I&#39;ve seen on Reddit lately was to support a regime change in Syria. The propaganda was seen through (as with Libya) because the information and arguments did not stand up to scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet what&#39;s happening is happening on this planet, no?  It doesn&#39;t matter what it might seem is or is not the case on a place like Reddit.  The proof is ultimately in the how things are actually going, and what is in reality happening is that Israel is bombing the fuck out of Palestine and the US is both indirectly supporting them (by having given them the bombs in the first place), and directly supporting them (by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/18/obama-israel-gaza_n_2154008.html?ncid=webmail1">spineless swine condoning the murderous atrocities Israel is responsible for</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, we can discuss all the points here and it becomes obvious that most people think firing rockets indiscriminately into israel is a very stupid thing to do</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it is, but the real point with regard to the effectiveness of the Zionist shill propaganda shows itself in the continued violence being perpetrated upon the Palestinian people by Israel regardless of what you or I or anyone else on a place like Reddit might think or say.  Therefore, your original point wondering about whether &quot;Israel&#39;s argument is more reasonable to many more people on reddit than the gazan one&quot; I feel is one that is <em>heavily</em> influenced unfortunately by that same PR machine that also effects and influences the MSM and much of the planet for that matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s very irresponsible and someone should protect the gazan&#39;s from their leaders</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s own leaders - more effective as they could possibly be - are NOT the biggest problem the Gazan people are facing in the least.</p>

<p>Heck, it&#39;s more than possible.  <em>I</em> <strong><em>myself</em></strong> am one of those that feels that Israel has the right to defend itself from a rocket attack.  I think <em>anyone</em> absolutely has the right to defend itself against a rocket attack.</p>

<p>However, this is not what is going on in Israel.  You see, if I walk up to you, kick you in the balls, punch you in the face, and then call your mother a slut and spit on you while you&#39;re on the ground, would I then have the right to say that I must &quot;defend myself against your evil tyranny&quot; when you get up and try to punch me back?</p>

<p>If you call my saying that you would MORE than have the right to punch back - and that indeed I would deserve to actually get my ass <em>kicked</em> under these circumstances - a &quot;bias&quot;...then okay.  We have very different definitions of what a bias actually is.</p>

<p>by the same token, israel is keeping an attacking rabid dog at bay.  we can use all the analogies we want.   israel isn&#39;t going to let the rabid dogs attack them, and certain gazans won&#39;t be kept from attacking their perceived oppressors unless by force.   the only rational solution is to cease all violence on both sides.</p>

<p>You fail to realize that 1) you&#39;re a pit bull and the dog &quot;attacking&quot; you is a chihuahua.  Additionally, 2) you&#39;ve been goading that chihuahua for years, telling it you&#39;re going to kill him just like you (already) killed his wife and six pups before it.</p>

<p>If this dog is rabid now, it is only because it was <em>made</em> to be such.  No other reason.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/OAmn2.jpg"><em>RELEVANT</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>israel isn&#39;t going to let the rabid dogs attack them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they&#39;re not.  They <em>are</em> the rabid dogs.  What&#39;s needed is a country of dog catchers to come in and <em>tame</em> these rabid dogs from Israel.</p>

<p>Many Gazans will justifiably <em>not</em> stop defending themselves because they have no choice but <em>to</em> defend themselves - even if only by throwing occasional rocks against the guns of the rabid dogs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only rational solution is to cease all violence on both sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is absolutely, 100% correct and agreed.</p>

<p>You do realize that it is Israel and the Zionists that have thwarted all UN attempts to an Israel Palestine peace agreement? to a unanimous nonproliferation agreement?  Literally EVERYONE except Israel and its owned guard dog - the U.S. - have agreed to and signed every peace agreement available and proposed by the UN.</p>

<p>Israel and the U.S. have been the only ones that haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>What does that tell you?  Who&#39;s really interested in ceasing the violence and who is it that&#39;s continuing it?</p>

<p>Well maybe they need to get their leaders to act right, because these leaders have acted in such a way that represents Israel as an evil, war-thirsty place for decades now.</p>

<p>Agreed.  This, unfortunately, goes more for Israel than anyone else, however.</p>
