<p>For the past few days this subreddit has been derailed with one-sided posts siding with palestine and criticizing everything Israel with very little-to-no conspiracies to them. </p>

<p>I know the two countries are big in the news right now and this is normal, but we really shouldn&#39;t let it detract the meaning of this subreddit into a normal anti-Israel subreddit. That won&#39;t do anything but chase potential members away, both believers/non-believers.</p>

<p>So how about it, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Could we please start going back on track with actual conspiracies like Icke/bilderburgs/chemtrails and less anti-Israel/pro-Palestine posts? I miss reading the discussions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy at hand is that Israel is not the US&#39;s friend, as there&#39;s no proven strategic boon that warrants that the United States has to fight their wars for them, as well as bully the UN into overlooking their atrocities.</p>

<p>The anti-Israel posts usually coincide with this conspiracy, so there is no &quot;being anti-Israel for the sake of being anti-Israel.&quot; which I know is what you want to claim. It&#39;s a legitimate conspiracy that every single American has to ponder, especially now that Israel is butchering Gaza (Again), on tax-payer dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to agree with you but .. again, I can&#39;t. I really have no love for the state of Israel but I don&#39;t think half the posts on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> even belongs since they&#39;re all common battle reports or quotes of other nation leaders on the current conflict and all with an anti-israel or pro-palestine slant.</p>

<p>I know there&#39;s also the fact that <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is deleting said posts but I still do not think that&#39;s an excuse to post them here. But then again, I&#39;m not a moderator and all I spoke above is just a suggestion.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> wants to go on it&#39;s path of reporting news from the conflict, then by all means go ahead. It&#39;s just going to derail the subreddit further.</p>

<p>But I do see your point. A nuanced view of international conflict and law is difficult to do with hatred (anti-semitism in this case) clouding one&#39;s judgement. And a good amount of those espousing anti-Israeli viewpoints just hate Jewish people. Hatred is not a valid premise for an argument.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, yes I do believe that terrorists, including Palestinian ones (and Jewish ones for that matter, but they&#39;re more common than Israeli terrorists and are frequently not even practicing Jews) are cockroaches.

<p>Directly from General Petraeus testimony to Congress in 2010... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests in the AOR [Area of Operations]. Israeli-Palestinian tensions often flare into violence and large-scale armed confrontations. The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas.&quot;</p>

<p>The <strong>&quot;due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel.&quot;</strong> not only pinpoints the root cause, it also lays the blame.</p>

<p>There is no problem with &quot;perception&quot; either.  The truth is easy to verify. How many times have you heard multiple...multiple U.S. Government Officials and Presidents utter &quot;U.S. Support for Israel is Unconditional, Unshakable, Unquestionable, or even Rock Solid.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just gave examples and, by far, they are actual conspiracies by definition. Maybe they were bad examples. But what the top posts are for front page <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have been about discussing the current war with Gaza and how it&#39;s funded by tax-payer money. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how it&#39;s been for the past few days. Just Israel shooting missles into Gaza funded by American taxpayer money and the U.N. Everyone knows this, it&#39;s a general fact, and there&#39;s nothing &quot;conspiracy&quot; about that. </p>

<p>How is it speaking of any other conspiracy any different with all the conspiracies surrounding Zionists controlling/killing everything in the world? Isn&#39;t that just as &quot;bullshit&quot; as what you said about the others?</p>

<p>I never actually said to stop with the Zionist/NWO stuff, mind you. I don&#39;t care if that goes on. I just dislike seeing all these general conflict reports or calling a reporter a bitch for doing her job.</p>

<p>As for the weather in Israel? I don&#39;t know. But where I am in the U.S.? Freezing as fuck. How&#39;s the weather for you on the Texmex border?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious that the bulk of your replies are merely filler for the childish insults that fill your mind. You&#39;re just butthurt that r/skeptic debunked your silly claim yesterday that &quot;there is no such thing as the official story&quot; on 9/11.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/13g7hg/rskeptic_there_are_problems_among_us/c74e8t7?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/13g7hg/rskeptic_there_are_problems_among_us/c74e8t7?context=3</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting theory and perhaps personally true as I&#39;m just as tired as seeing all the political stuff. But it&#39;s not my intention, I just don&#39;t wish to see this subreddit turn into something it&#39;s not and with most of the same topic for nearly the last week, it&#39;s just irksome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am certain that the majority of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Military Leadership, and Civilian Government Officials would LOVE to see Israel finally take care of it&#39;s own problems.</p>

<p>The CIA rates Israeli intelligence community as one of the most hostile threats it faces.  Obama was recorded venting his frustration with Netanyahu, in an public conversation that greasy little french weasel that was recently voted out of office.   And no U.S. General is willing to start WWIII by caving into warmongering Zionist-Jews endlessly whining about bombing Iran&#39;s ficticious nuclear weapons program.</p>
