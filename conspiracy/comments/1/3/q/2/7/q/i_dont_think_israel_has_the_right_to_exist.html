    <div class="md"><p>Ideally, but not realistically. We&#39;re only human.</p>

<p>Debating the morality of Israel&#39;s independence is kind of irrelevant though, since none of us can change history. What <em>is</em> more relevant is discussing the possible futures of Israel and Palestine. Personally I can&#39;t see the logic or fairness behind OP&#39;s proposal. Forcibly terminating the independence of an existing country by any means - military or political - is unjust. IMO the only just solution is a two-state solution. But sadly I suspect it will be a while before the Israelis and the Palestinians stop shooting each other for long enough to transit to two fully independent states. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israelis are not inclined to reproduce as fast as Palestine, thus making them a &quot;dieing state&quot;. <em>(non-Jews = 24.56 births/1,000 population.  jews) = 18.97 births/1,000 population.)</em> </p>

<p>Israel has poisoned themselves and their ability (in addition to their inclination) to reproduce, thus making them a dieing state. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/study-quality-of-israeli-sperm-down-40-in-past-decade-1.275772">http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/study-quality-of-israeli-sperm-down-40-in-past-decade-1.275772</a></p>

<p>The &quot;powers that be&quot; created Israel for the soul purpose of being destroyed. <em>(See: &quot;Albert pike, 3 world wars.&quot;)</em> I&#39;m pretty sure being &quot;destroyed&quot; will more or less make them a non-state.</p>

<p>God mentioned his thoughts on the Ashkenazi, converts to &quot;Jew&quot; in the year 740 AD who we call &quot;European Jews&quot;, quite well in the book of revelation 3: 9. (Does not sound good for them.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an &quot;extremist&quot; when it comes to political issues, but I believe that agenda of universal human rights and the supremacy of free democratic government that progressive parties all over the world support - and that right wingers and neo-con parties all over the world reject - is the right way.  So...I agree that all countries have a right to defend themselves with legitimate force, but Israel&#39;s genocidal apartheid against peaceful Palestinians is not legitimate force. It&#39;s irrational, vengeful, and wrong, and the US should immediately withdraw alll support until the Israeli government agrees to confine its tactics to lawful methods of defense.</p>
