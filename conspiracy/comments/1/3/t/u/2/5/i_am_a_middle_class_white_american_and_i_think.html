<p>You didn&#39;t give a straight answer though. What should happen to the the millions of Israeli born and raised in Israel past 1948? I mean if you seriously think the state should be &quot;erased&quot; then surely you&#39;ve thought of what would happen to its people right? If you&#39;re talking large scale genocide you should say it instead of dodging the question. If you have a different solution I&#39;d be interested to here it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say we ask for our toys back.  Sandbox Rules:  If you can&#39;t play with your toys <em>nicely</em>, then they get taken away.  Yes, the Israeli state is pretty much funded by the USA.  AIPAC and other lobbyists keep it going that way, and they like it.  </p>

<p>But, if you take away all of their American firepower, and leave them to their own devices... let&#39;s see who else helps out Nutty-yahoo and that regime.  You think Russia or China is come to their aid?  Fuck no.  You think there may be some <em>recource</em> from the Palestenian Arabs?  Who... technically have higher chances of HEBREW blood than the Ashkenazi &quot;Jew<em>ish</em>&quot; folks that came there, later on? (post-1948, thank you BougDolivar).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well just like tttt0tttt you didn&#39;t actually answer the question. Just went along the lines of &quot;They&#39;ll get whats coming&quot;. But what does that mean? Most of the population wasn&#39;t even alive when Israel was created.</p>

<p>The US only gives about 3 billion worth of aid to the Israel which is not that much when you consider Israels GDP is over 240 billion. Russia and China don&#39;t care about the situation at all. They just tend lean towards the Palestinian side because there are 56 Muslim countries in the world who they don&#39;t want to piss off. Also, I&#39;m not sure why you and others are obsessed with Ashkenazi Jews. Half of the Israeli population is of Mizrahi decesnt (which is Arab). If you&#39;re saying that you want or you believe in genocide against the Israeli population why don&#39;t you just say so? If not what do you think should happen to the majority of the Israelis if the state is erased? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... I&#39;m not talking a &quot;get what&#39;s coming to them&quot; of the Israeli people as a <em>whole</em>, there are some folks (to my understanding) in Israel that are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=video&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CDsQtwIwAQ&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DB5uq2jNxS58&amp;amp;ei=s0u0UKvUCI-a8gSe3IHoDw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHeHRCvCGDsqxbAJjWdPsJa9sH0kA&amp;amp;sig2=5jbgjPyL5ppywR4ThA1wQw">refusing to serve in the IDF because of what&#39;s going on in Gaza</a>, and how they view the one-sideness of the armaments.  There are also folks who will <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-new-israeli-apartheid-poll-reveals-widespread-jewish-support-for-policy-of-discrimination-against-arab-minority-8223548.html">poll towards an apartheid state</a>, as well.  It&#39;s a mixed bucket, there.</p>

<p>But, if you go... oh, I dunno... back to <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V5jYS8eezmU/TG_gNJKGN5I/AAAAAAAACy8/2Gqksi1es4k/s1600/Palestinian_land_loss_Map.jpg">the original UN Plan</a>, even.. and <em>maybe</em> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=video&amp;amp;cd=6&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CEUQtwIwBQ&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democracynow.org%2F2011%2F9%2F23%2Fdebate_does_un_statehood_bid_advance&amp;amp;ei=TEy0UMCjMoes8AT734CADQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHut-i9sfh96ZhoiCiuOjyIbRuQmA&amp;amp;sig2=NtB655_ApWVhO095EtTlGA">give Palestine some UN recognition</a>, too.  (that&#39;s up for debate... by the People of the Palestinian State.. or whatever gets organized).  </p>

<p>Back to my <strong>main point</strong> earlier, though... if you take away their toys... let&#39;s see what happens.  Most folks will go about their daily lives.  Would some of the Palestinian land get claimed back?  Look at the above map.  Would Israelis get relocated?  Would it be because of the Israeli leadership?  These are all scenarios I can live with, as long as we quit funding other nations and get on with our own business in the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The link about those polling towards an apartheid state is inaccurate. It was reported by Haaretz originally but they issued a <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/survey-most-israeli-jews-wouldn-t-give-palestinians-vote-if-west-bank-was-annexed.premium-1.471644?block=true">correction</a>. Most Israelis are against annexing the West Bank. </p>

<p>The original plan was rejected by the Palestinian and Arab states and they decided to attack the newly founded state of Israel costing many Israeli lives. Why on earth would Israel go back to 1948? The majority of the people who were directly affected aren&#39;t even alive anymore. </p>

<p>You still didn&#39;t address what should happen to the majority of Israelis if Israel is &quot;erased&quot;? If you think the state should be erased, than what should happen to the people living there? At this point the Israeli born there are natives and those born outside the state are foreigners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off... I&#39;ve never once mentioned &quot;erased&quot;.  Nobody... Palestinian, Israeli, Bangladeshi, San Franciscan... etc... should ever be &quot;erased&quot; as you put it.  BUT.. if there was a UN resolution that founded the State of Israel, then that&#39;s what should&#39;ve been adhered to, in the first place, regardless of who attacked who <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>And, you&#39;re right... the majority of the people who were directly affected aren&#39;t alive anymore... so why should this be such of a shock?  I&#39;m totally agreeing with you that folks born <strong>anywhere</strong> are natives of the land that they are born in.  And, there is still a lot of area that could be given back to Palestine.  I think we spend too much time talking about t&quot;why things wouldn&#39;t work&quot;, instead of coming up with ways and means that would.</p>

<p>Would that mean that some of the current Israeli&#39;s folk have to give up their land (in a sense, give it <em>back</em>)?  Probably.  Is that the specific resident&#39;s fault... or the fault of their leadership, telling them that they have the rights to land that they, technically, don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Speaking of Native Americans (along this thread), the Sioux Nation is going through the same thing with the U.S. Government, right now, over the Black Hills.  I, personally, would love to see them get their land back.  But, the Sioux look at the land as, &quot;It wasn&#39;t the Government&#39;s land to give away, in the first place.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s kinda what&#39;s been happening in to the Palestinian land for the last 70 some-odd years.  Is the responsibility of the average, everyday Israeli citizen?  No.  Did the government take land and <em>give</em> it to the citizens?  Yes.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s where my original &quot;karma&quot; comment comes back into play.  No, it&#39;s not the fault of the average Israeli citizen, but they may end up a little butt-hurt and displaced because of the actions of the government.  Just the same way Hamas/Fatah/Hezbollah are not a representation of every Palestinian.  But hey... whatever.  The US and Israel stood up Hamas.  So.. technically, Israel is just as bad as the US when it comes to &quot;creating terrorists to fight&quot;. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying that you want or you believe in genocide against the Israeli population why don&#39;t you just say so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that no one in this thread is advocating genocide against the Israeli population.  </p>

<p>You seem to be implying that all Israeli Jews would be killed if the Israeli State ceased to exist as it currently does.  This assumption is pretty weak in my eyes, especially when most of the anger towards Israel in the region stems from Israel&#39;s continued refusal to let Palestinians govern themselves in their own State.</p>

<p>Sure, extremists will most likely always want all Jews pushed into the Mediterranean, but I&#39;d like to think that moderates in Palestine &amp; surrounding Muslim nations would no longer support groups like Hamas &amp; Hezbollah if they were given their own State based on the condition that rocket attacks &amp; other attempts against Israel&#39;s sovereignty must stop altogether.  </p>

<p>If this were to occur, Muslim moderates would at least have something to lose instead of the status quo that sees more settlements going up by the day...    </p>

<p>Its not obvious at all. If it was people would straight up say what should happen to the Isreali population. Instead the other commenters are being vague and saying Israel should be &quot;erased&quot;  and they&#39;ll get whats coming to them or they&#39;ll be treated like native Americans. Not one person has said anything about Israel &quot;ceasing to exist as it currently does&quot; either. Even you have not answered my question, you just danced around it. What should happen to the Israeli population if the state was &quot;erased&quot;? Unless you&#39;re suggested a two state solution, are you? </p>

<p>While it would be nice to have a two state solution, their is no guarantee that Hamas or other groups is going to stop targeting Israel. What makes things especially difficult is you have countries like Iran that completely reject a two state solution and wants ALL of Israel to be Islamic Palestine. Here is the Supreme Leader himself <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/10/201110222010936488.html">saying it.</a> Iran will be there waiting to fund and train groups to attack Israel even if it does go for a two state solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In what way did I dance around what you were asking?  I thought it was clear from my comment that I support a two-state solution, preferably one based loosely on the 67&#39; borders with mutually agreed upon land swaps and East Jerusalem as the capitol of Palestine.</p>

<p>As I see the situation right now, moderate Muslims shouldn&#39;t be expected to stand up to the violent tactics that Hamas and other groups are using against Israeli civilians.  First, think of the dangers of questioning leaders during wartime (remember when Bush said Americans were either with or against him).  Muslims in the region have grown up watching Israel relentlessly attack and invade surrounding lands (mix between self-defense and pushes to reclaim territories for a &quot;security buffer&quot;), and given the disproportionate amount of Muslim civilians that Israel has killed over the last few decades, who can honestly blame moderate Muslims for keeping quiet while barbarians in Hamas &amp; other militant groups launch rockets indiscriminately.  </p>

<p>The logical way forward would be for Israel to provide moderate Muslims with a reason to stand up to extremist groups who are hell bent on Israel&#39;s destruction.  With a Palestinian state established, moderates would risk losing their statehood if attacks continued, and Israel would be justified (in my opinion) to reoccupy Palestine in the events that attacks continued after statehood is granted.</p>

<p>The status quo features Israel failing to provide any concessions to moderate Muslims as illegal settlements continue to expand.  Part of me thinks that the Likud party is simply hell-bent on reclaiming all of Palestine and &quot;dealing&quot; with the Palestinian &quot;problem&quot; the same way they have been since 1948.  </p>

<p>Moderate Palestinians need to be given some skin in the game.  They need their own state, as well as clear instructions that they&#39;re on a short leash in regards to allowing/failing to thwart rocket attacks on Israeli civilians.</p>

<p>which wouldn&#39;t have happened if certain countries had not tried to defeat the occupiers.. but they didn&#39;&#39;t.  a good number of refugees ended up in the captured territory.  some was given back.

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think Israel is stealing their land?</p>

<p>1.Jews entered &quot;Israel&quot; in 1312 B.C.E., two thousand years before the rise of Islam.
2.Arab refugees began identifying themselves as part of a Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern State of Israel.
3.Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 B.C.E, the Jews had dominion over the land for one thousand years with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years.</p>

<p>4.The only Arab domination since the conquest in 635 C.E. lasted no more than 22 years.</p>

<p>5.For over 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital.</p>

<p>6.King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The Arabs didn&#39;t want the land in 1947 that was offered to them under UN resolution 181.</p>

<p>And then on the same day the UN handed the Jews their portion of the land, and after Britain packed up leaving nobody claiming what was supposed to be the Arab portion of the land, the Arab states decided it was smarter to send in troops to secure land and Israel&#39;s land instead of peacefully accepting their land. Brilliant fucking decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ashkenazi Jews have the same tribal affiliations as all other Jewish communities - Israel, Levi (Kohen), and Judah.</p>

<p>Your claim that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of the Khazars, however, has been completely debunked.</p>

<p>The &quot;theory&quot; that Ashkenazi Jews descended from the Khazars originated with various anti-semitic/white and Christian supremacy groups/racial theorists/and Arab groups wishing to distance modern Jews from Israel. Although, there is evidence that the existing European Jewish population did absorb some Jewish Khazars, the claim of the Khazars being the origin of European Jewry has never been accepted by credible scholars for various reasons:</p>

<p>Khazarian history: the accepted theory is that at most, the Royal and and ruling classes converted to Judaism for mainly political reasons. There is no real evidence to support the whole population converted to Judaism. Furthermore, the majority of these converts to Judaism went on to convert to Christianity and Islam.</p>

<p>Jewish migration in history: what many people don&#39;t know is that a percentage of Jews who consider themselves Ashkenazi were Sephardi and didn&#39;t enter Europe until the Spanish expulsion. This can be seen through Jewish family names that are Spanish/Portugese/Italian/Sicilian in origin. (example: Margolis and Shapiro)</p>

<p>And finally, the nail in the coffin: Genetic research: all current genetic research supports that Ashkenazi Jews are virtually indistinguishable from other Jewish groups (Sephardi/Mizrachi) and in turn, other Middle Eastern groups with little genetic input from Europeans. DNA research amongst Ashkenazi Jews shows a significant female founder ancestry originating in the Middle East, with about 40% of the current Ashkenazi population descending matrilinially from just 4 women dating to the first and second centuries.</p>

<p>In regard to the origin of the name &#39;Ashkenazi&#39; for European Jews is that Ashkenaz was the ancient Jewish name for Germany just as Sepharad was the ancient Jewish name for Spain hence &#39;Sephardi&#39; Jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To do DNA testing, there must be material to test against.  You can&#39;t test people that are alive and claim they match genetically to people over 2000 years ago if you have nothing to match against.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any genetic research that shows that Khazarian &quot;jews&quot; are descendents of ancient Israel.  I&#39;ve read articles that say they&#39;ve found a link, but I&#39;ve read many more that say there is no link.</p>

<p>Regardless---if no one can produce a deed showing that Palestine is owned by eastern european &quot;jews&quot;, then I&#39;m not willing to believe the land belongs to eastern european &quot;jews&quot;.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I just &quot;converted&quot; to judaism.  And my god says I can have your house and your land.  Kindly GTFO or I will have to kill you and your family.</p>

<p>&quot;Ashkenazi Jews, whose genetic profiles indicated between 30% to 60% admixture with Europeans, nevertheless clustered more closely with Middle Eastern and Sephardic Jews, a finding the researchers say is inconsistent with the Khazar hypothesis. &quot;I would hope that these observations would put the idea that Jewishness is just a cultural construct to rest,&quot; Ostrer says.&quot;</p>

<p>Technically, even if Israel wasn&#39;t the hateful, cowardly, world-raping, two faced nation that it is, and it was actually a wonderfully just, kind, and benign land, it STILL wouldn&#39;t be justified in having the land that it currently has, since that land was stolen for it by England <em>from</em> the Palestenians in the first place.</p>

<p>Yes, Hamas did send rockets over to the south. The burning question is WHY.</p>

<p>The media have cruelly not reported on Israeli PROVOCATION which immediately PRECEDED the rocket response by Hamas. Israel&#39;s media is so controlled that its citizens don&#39;t even know what IOF is doing to provoke the Palestinians.  </p>

<p>The everyday Israeli is carefully led to believe that Hamas&#39;s rocket attacks occur in a vacuum. Such fools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, &quot;massacre&quot; was MY term for this so-called war of the 4th largest military in the world turning all its might against a tiny little nation with NO army, NO navy and NO air force and NOTHING to fight with except large firecrackers. I pray to no god but if I did I would pray that people like you would throw your effing tv&#39;s out the window and stop listening to our government&#39;s spin on what is going on in the land of the bible. Are you really so ignorant that you can&#39;t grasp the concept that the US and Israel are framing this conflict in the media in such a way as to lead us all to the conclusion that &quot;Israel is the victim and the Gazans are spawn of the devil?&quot; Let&#39;s try an experiment: let&#39;s try framing the conflict in a slightly different light. Humor me, please.

    <div class="md"><p>firstly, I got rid of the tv years ago.  please don&#39;t assume I don&#39;t read both sides of the issue.  </p>

<p>The situation is a tragedy for sure - but I think Israeli people want a peaceful resolution and security at the same time.  I can understand why they would support stopping the rockets raining down, as I can understand the frustration and anger of gazans.   it&#39;s a tragedy all round.  I don&#39;t think there are many israeli people that would vote to &#39;massacre&#39; people that weren&#39;t firing rockets at them.</p>

<p>from a Gazan point of view, if my frustration and anger is so great that I must suicide bomb, or fire rockets into schools, then I have lost as a person.  I have given into the enemy.   Better I forgive them and kill them with kindness.</p>

Now, would you please read the article I just sent you, paying particular attention to the author&#39;s statement saying essentially that any time the world hears of Hamas rockets falling in southern Israel, IT&#39;S ALWAYS IN RESPONSE TO AN ACT OR ACTS OF AGGRESSION BY ISRAEL. For the record, it&#39;s only Christians who have a tradition of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot;.

<p>This has been going on for ages.. it must be obvious to those retaliating that they will incur only more wrath from the mighty israeli forces.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t however see clearly what you mean by aggression by the israeli people, at least in the sense of unprovoked or unwarranted actions.  can you give me an example??  Have israelis been blowing themselves up and taking out civilians out in busy restaurants nightclubs, shoppng centers and buses in Gaza for example?  </p>

<p>What have israeli people done to Gazan&#39;s to justify rockets raining on civilians?</p>

<p>1- Israeli Military Escalation in the Gaza Strip</p>

<p>Thursday, 08 November 2012</p>

<p>At approximately 08:00, IOF moved nearly 300 meters into the east of al-Qarara village, northeast of Khan Yunis. They leveled areas of Palestinian land amidst indiscriminate shooting. A few hours later, they moved southwards to ‘Abassan village. They opened fire indiscriminately and leveled areas of Palestinian land. An Israeli helicopter gunship also opened fire at the area. At approximately 16:30, as a result of the indiscriminate shooting by IOF military vehicles, 13-year-old Ahmed Younis Khader Abu Daqqa was seriously wounded by a bullet to the abdomen. At the time he was shot, Ahmed had been playing football with his friends in front of his family’s house, located nearly 1,500 meters away from the area where the IOF were present. He was evacuated to the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Yunis, but he was pronounced dead 15 minutes later. IOF remained in the area until 00:30 on the following day. In his testimony to PCHR, Mohammed Tariq Abu Daqqa, 14, stated:</p>

<p>“On Thursday evening, 08 November 2012, my friend, Ahmed Abu Daqqa, invited me to play football, which he liked so much. We began to play football in front of his house together with Khaled ‘Ali Abu Daqqa, Shadi Akram Abu Daqqa and Fares Hassan Qudaih. Ahmed was wearing sports clothes and he played as a goalkeeper. We knew that there was an Israeli incursion in the area and we heard sporadic shooting. We thought that we were safe because we were relatively far from the affected area. However, at approximately 16:30, I saw a bullet hitting the door of Ahmed’s house. I soon saw Ahmed falling onto the ground. He then stood up putting his hands on his abdomen and screaming. He moved into his house. The children who were playing with us escaped. I called Ahmed’s brother and told him that Ahmed was wounded. Soon after, Ahmed’s brother carried him out of the house and asked me to call an ambulance. I immediately went to a nearly grocery shop and asked its owner to call an ambulance and he did. Ahmed was then transported by a civilian car to the hospital. I learnt later that he died. Before he was wounded, he had asked me to photograph him wearing the uniform of Real Madrid, of which he was a fan.”</p>

<p>There&#39;s much more. Women, children... just murdered on these routine incursions.  The straw that broke the camel&#39;s back was the setup and subsequent assassination of the Gaza equivalent of Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak - Hamas Commander Ahmed Jabari. </p>

<p>Can you imagine the fury Israelis would unleash if Hamas had assassinated Ehud Barak? Well, there you have it. Jabari was taken out and Hamas was enraged - to say nothing about their fury at the dozen or so children murdered during this particular week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israelis have been tried and sentenced for some incidents - it&#39;s unclear what are war crimes but it doesn&#39;t seem to be a campaign against civilians from my perspective. It certainly doesn&#39;t justify committing war crimes of your own.</p>

<p>Ahmed Jabari was taken out in a vehicle with no civilian casualties.  In contrast I believe Ehud Barak would have been blown up in a schoolyard full of children without a second thought if the opportunity was there.  Firing rockets isn&#39;t helping at all.  Anyway peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are smart, hard-working, funny, and most importantly they help each other out. One Jew gets a job as a teacher and now he is in a position to write letters of recommendation for students. He knows little David from the Temple that he goes to every week. He does not know little Johnny who goes to Church. He gives the heads up to David&#39;s parents that their kid needs to study harder if he wants to get into a good private school, maybe he tutors the kid on the weekends for extra money. When the time comes for college applications, he can easily write a good letter for David because he knows him so well. David does much better on the SATs because he has been tutored for years. Johnny gets a good letter too, but not as good as David&#39;s. Johnny does good on the SATs, but not as good as David. David goes to a good competative school where he has to work hard. Johnny ends up at a second rank school where he can kinda float on by while drinking beer. Guess who ends up with the good job paying the big bucks which further allows him to pay for extra help for his own son when the time comes?</p>

<p>Some of this stuff is not even intentional, as I tried to show in my stupid little story. Other times, it is. It is the &quot;Is it good for the Jews?&quot; mentality. All imigrannt groups have this problem to an extent in the US. The Italians, the Irish, the Germans, the Greeks all had to try to make it and make things better for themselves. For more recent groups it is the same. But the Jews have their &quot;We are God&#39;s chosen people&quot; problem. Their non-Jews = non-human problem. I mean, we can go on and on about the history of the Jews, but just Google and read or buy/borrow some books and read.</p>

While our national debt (as of today) is at $16,319,856,395,387.22, the US continues to give away over $20 billion to Israel ($3 billion in direct aid, up to $17 billion in indirect aid, and God only knows how much is given away in &#39;hidden aid&#39;).  The overall cost to and impact on the US is actually in the trillions! [Source: all around you, just wake up!]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. What is funny is, I feel the same way about China. </p>

<p>Now a person can criticize China like that, and no one bats an eye. But Israel! oh noes! You just committed a racist crime! Just look at the programmed responses you got from a few people here.</p>

<p>That said, China doesnt bother me as much as Israel - even though, objectively they are as bad if not worse than Israel - probably because Im not relentlessly pounded by a media that is obsessed with viciously attacking any criticism at all of Israel while glossing over their atrocities. Hey, I wonder how long into December we&#39;ll get before we get the regular mainstream media monthly WWII stories reminding us how bad we should feel for Israel right before they start bombing someone again? You know, some heartwarming tale about some Jews who barely escaped... seriously, start paying attention and counting them, these WWII/Nazi/Jew stories come out like clockwork.</p>

<p>China and Israel are both horrible human rights abusing blights on humanity - but at least China doesnt relentlessly keep trying to play the role of victim, and have a massive PR machine assaulting me with endless bullshit propaganda.</p>

<p>Well, ok, maybe they do, but at least its not in English so it doesnt bother me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To understand Native American&#39;s better, do you just look into the history books written by those who exterminated them?  Do you look into Catholic texts to understand Protestants?  For any stance, you should look at multiple sides, not just one, to gain a better understanding of the topic.  </p>

<p>There is a sizable portion of the world which are against Zionists.  Israel&#39;s own actions make you question their motives (Israel condemns Iran for their nuclear energy development efforts, yet Israel is the only state in the middle east with undeclared nuclear weapons).  Israel start&#39;s conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and uses weapons which are considered inhumane.  Hell the US has to pay Egypt to just get along with Israel.</p>

<p>If Israel is a democracy, it is the only democracy which is representative of the Jewish people.  Does Israel represent the Jewish religion?  Should their actions be judged against the followers of Judaism worldwide? </p>

<p>I think that Israel&#39;s actions are not that of the Jewish people, but of Zionists.  While I don&#39;t think Israel&#39;s actions represent the desires of the followers of the Jewish religion, I do think that they negatively effect people&#39;s views of Judaism. </p>

If you then ran around telling people NOT to read something because it is bias then your attempts would be to censor knowledge.
Prime example is that Mein Kampf is still in print by the ADL.  If you pick up the book at a store it will have a preface by Abe Foxman.  It explains the books historical significance and bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes so far.  So far it is talking about how Jews pretty much stick together and dominate any industry they are in.  If their are laws in place, then they find another way to excel.  Jews, it seems, are very very business savvy (pretty much inventing international business, as well as funding the Columbus Expedition).</p>

<p>Anyone owning all of the press can control the public opinion of the people.  Owning the banks, you can determine if that country will be able to go to war, or will be stuck in economy crippling austerity.</p>

<p>There seems to be some truth to this, since every major city in the US has holocaust monuments.  There are laws which make denying the holocaust illegal.  Yet we don&#39;t memorialize any of the other genocides.  If the Jewish Genocide was so horrible, we should think every other genocide is equally horrible.  But the world doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>

<p>The holocaust is cherished and forced down our throats, so that the Zionist&#39;s in power stay in power.  The first time I saw the Israeli President wear a star of david patch made it so clear to me.  Here he is, wearing something that everyone associates with the holocaust, on his damn suit.  Talk about manipulation.</p>

<p>There never were any gas chambers.  The Holocaust is fabricated to convince the world at the time that the Jews deserve their own place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AMEN!!!  Can any Christian honestly say they see &quot;Jesus&quot; in the way we (and yes &quot;we&quot; since there would not even be a Israel with out the billions we (America) keep pouring to that country.  billions used to oppress the Palestinian people.  Is it just the odd combo of religion once again screwing with out foreign policy.  the Christian of this nation mostly care about only one thing and that is setting up the perfect conditions for the second coming of Christ.  It should also be noted that their interruption of the events that lay that foundation are well.... let&#39;s say open to dispute as is almost everything in the Bible itself.  Example the Jews as a group rejected the teaching of Christ which too many makes them no longer God&#39;s chosen people, but rather now the chosen are those that profess a belief in Him.  So the reason your local little (or mega) church down the street thinks that Israel is SO important is that THEY are not going to see HEAVEN until Israel has it&#39;s GODLY war.  Then they all &quot;serve their purpose&quot; and bring on the second coming of Christ.  So do we act on the words of Christ and live as He told us too, or are we the selfish ego driven fallen nature sinful riddle monsters we say we are against.  </p>

<p>Really what would Jesus say or do when it come to the decisions we are currently facing.  More &amp; more tax cuts for the rich, cause 14% is just high for the super rich.  make the poor work until they are 70 and eat dog food if they can afford it... that&#39;s what Jesus wants?</p>

<p>what about this ALL FOREIGN AID from this day forward is given in food and water project only.  A complete and total cut off of ALL military spending in for other nation. give food and water not bullets.</p>

<p>yeah I know it will never happen because the people of this country no longer have any say in how our nation treats the rest of the world much less here at home.  we have become a corporate state that serves only the rich.  anything else... not so much.</p>

<p>now for the joke of the day.  &quot;Obama is going to fix that with his hope and change by creating the most open government in the history of this nation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tax dollars are not a direct line to each cause the US supports financially.  rather, you pay taxes because you live in this country as an investment into its future.  There is no problem there.  However, you vote people into seats in government who share your views and thus represent you and your opinion.  They in turn help with the distribution and use of the US income, the tax dollars and other.  If you dont like it then you can either run for office, or get a friend of yours to run for office and vote for them and help them campaign, so your views can be better represented in the government.  That is how you make change, but until then you still must pay a tax to recieve the benefits of living in this great land.</p>

<p>Yes, believe it or not, the basic ideals of US government and politics is still very revolutionary, its just the people that make up the government that can be questionable.</p>

Are you just have to wonder if you have any idea what you&#39;re talking about when you post this kind of inflammatory racism on here. How about instead you go do some reading and see that the Israelis tried to be peaceful about all of this and the Palestinians decided that wasn&#39;t good enough. I mean you&#39;re basically siding with terrorists since we all damn well know that if the Palestinians got the Israelis land like they want, it would just be a shipping lane for Iran to send them more missiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I intend to teach my children to work hard, focus, and save. Too many people that live off the government aren&#39;t doing it for survival; they&#39;re doing it because it&#39;s easier than working and being financially responsible. I can think of three examples off the top of my head of people like this, that I know personally. I have no issue with funding education, which is known to reduce crime and poverty. I have no issue with directing the funds that do go to welfare or medicaid to more closely monitor those receiving the benefits. I have no issue with my tax money actually going to people just trying to get back on their feet.  </p>

<p>Greece is a prime example of when money being doled out by social programs outweighs the money being contributed by working people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a list of rocket attacks that were fired on Israel in 2012. Click on the rest of the years on the right hand side for more years. Randomly firing rockets at a country is most certainly an act of  terrorism. trying to get rid of the individuals responsible for those rocket attacks is not terrorism by definition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the &#39;collateral&#39; damage of civilian death is unforgivable. Israel is almost done building their Iron dome (which is the only thing the states should be supporting) so now Hamas rocket strikes are pretty much useless. If Israel stops bombing in return Hamas can&#39;t retaliate as they have nothing current to retaliate too making and further strikes by Hamas inexcusable as now they don&#39;t have a reason to fire back (not counting the years of oppression and slaughter)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news media has cruelly not reported on Israeli PROVOCATION which immediately PRECEDED the rocket response by Hamas. Israel&#39;s media is so controlled that its citizens don&#39;t even know what IOF is doing to the Palestinians. The everyday Israeli is carefully led to believe that Hamas&#39;s rocket attacks occur in a vacuum. Such fools. <a href="http://altahrir.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/did-israel-provoke-rockets-from-gaza-to-pressure-palestinians-to-back-off-un-bid/">http://altahrir.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/did-israel-provoke-rockets-from-gaza-to-pressure-palestinians-to-back-off-un-bid/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media never mentions, either, how Israel basically &quot;set up&quot; Hamas.  They figured that Hamas would be better than dealing with Yasser Arafat.  Hell, even the USA stepped in and said, &quot;You need democratic elections in Gaza, because <em>we know best</em>!&quot;.  Who did Gazan&#39;s elect?  Hamas.</p>

<p>So.. the underlying theme, here, is that both the US and Israel helped give &quot;substance&quot; to Hamas... just to later point the guns right back at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and open every one of of those rocket attack links, and you&#39;ll see that 99% of them landed in &quot;rural areas&quot; with &quot;no injuries; no deaths&quot;.  Of course, when you strap a bunch of bottle-rockets to a tin can with no explosive warhead... I don&#39;t really expect a bunch of casualties.</p>

<p>Look... I live in the South.  Especially, after this election... I perfectly understand some drunk rednecks pissed off about the overall situation of things and popping a few shots in the air.  Here, it&#39;s AR-15&#39;s.  There, it&#39;s what passes as &quot;rockets&quot;.</p>

<p>Even using your numbers its 10 bucks.</p>

<p>Now figure half the population doesnt work, or contribute in a meaningful way because their taxes are so low.</p>

<p>Then figure that the 3 Billion number is bullshit since its only counting direct military aid, not guaranteed federal loans - which historically have never been repaid, only &quot;forgiven&quot; when the bill comes due - or &quot;joint-defense&quot; projects like the US financed &quot;Iron-Dome&quot; defense system, nor does it include the myriad other radar and missile defense systems on Israeli soil that are US owned/operated and maintained by the US DoD....... all of which adds up to a number quite a bit fucking bigger than the 3 Billion they like to pretend is being spent, not even including the opportunity costs of all that money being wasted.</p>

<p>10 cents huh? The true drain of Israel on the US economy is more like 500-1500 dollars per working person per year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? You guys are still stuck on this? Regardless of the fact that Israel should&#39;ve ID&#39;d the ship, did you ever ask yourself why Israel would attack one of our ships? At the time, there was no political motive. We were staying neutral in that war and we stayed neutral after the attacks. What would attacking us have accomplished? Nothing. Of course the survivors are going to claim it was intentional. They didn&#39;t know what was going on and were defending themselves like crazy. In their heads, they were fending off a major attack, they don&#39;t want to believe that Israel did it on accident. Even then this happened 50 years ago while neither country is under the same rule. So, please, instead of sarcastically posting links to Google, why don&#39;t you explain to me what the fuck you think you&#39;re talking about?</p>
