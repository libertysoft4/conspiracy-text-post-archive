    <div class="md"><p>For one, it has been tested extensively, but I digress that I can&#39;t be bothered to find these studies for you at this time, I&#39;m busy. I&#39;ll instead stick to a more theoretical argument. Your current view on GMOs represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the science there involved. You seem to think that the minor change of a few genes in the DNA of an organism represents a large change in the organism itself, IE, changing a healthy food source into something dangerous. This is not true. Changing one or two structures in the DNA has very minute effects, sometimes to make it grow better in the cold, sometimes to incorporate a proven safe pesticide in tiny doses into the organism itself, or things to this effect. There is very little that could cause damage in humans, very little at all.</p>

<p>You people don&#39;t seem to have a problem with the fact that genetic modification has been going on for millennia in the form of artificial selection and cross breeding.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>They have turned our freedoms into our own personal vices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example?  Not saying you&#39;re not right or this isn&#39;t the case.  Just wondering exactly what you mean since this is a broad statement that it seems can apply to many different types of scenarios, and some of those scenarios in fact <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be looked upon as freedoms.  For example, the &quot;freedom&quot; to hurt others against their will directly or indirectly (which I&#39;m not assuming you&#39;re referring to here at all, of course.  I just don&#39;t know specifically what you mean).</p>

<p>I guess ultimately what I could just say is that some things that some people look upon as &quot;freedoms&quot; <em>are</em> indeed more personal vices than anything else and they <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> in fact be exercised to such a great extent.  After all, with great freedom comes great responsibility, and many of us are <em>very</em> irresponsible beings that might actually be better off having certain freedoms withheld from us than to be allowed to just do whatever we want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So many people interpret a guilty pleasure as a freedom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be something similar to what I&#39;m saying.  While I can certainly interpret it as being correct, I&#39;m not entirely sure since what you said can be taken in various ways.</p>

While it is useful for forecasting and I&#39;ve been watching it since 2008 it is dense and I usually have to discuss it (email thread) with a few people before I really can absorb it. I did find back then that the graphs of &#39;building tension language&#39; and &#39;release language&#39; matched up with terence mckenna&#39;s time wave zero.... I&#39;m still pretty unsure of exactly what the global coastal event will be although HPH reports go into how devastating it will be (they tend to always be on the worse side of what happens anyway) there is a second forecast for the global coastal flooding from Courtney Brown&#39;s Farsight Project but still no insight on <em>why</em>  </p>

<p>Freeman, of freemantv.com also goes into the coming space war which HPH predicts in their &#39;alien war&#39; subsets.  </p>

<p>The economic collapse is obvious, max keiser, peter schiff, zeitgeist addendum before they go into venus project crap. I doubt I need to go into that.  </p>

It is sort of the root of all conspiracies because it divides the population into smaller and smaller groups and allows for all the other conspiracies to be played out on top of the division it creates.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you seriously have it backwards.  Agenda 21 is being pushed under the guise of AGW in order for the big corporations to hoard resources, destroy the middle class, and set up world government.  It&#39;s blatant when you <em>ACTUALLY DO A LITTLE RESEARCH</em> instead of just going to sites that are funded by the big oil-money foundations(Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, etc) that <em>push</em> this shit and give colleges and schools &quot;grants&quot; to push that fucking bullshit and brainwash generation after generation.

    <div class="md"><p>My point is every American president in the modern era will probably blatantly lie to the public at one point or another.  Obama had no reason to want the ambassador to Libya killed, and reports showed that the ambassador knew about the possibility of an oncoming threat and chose to stay anyway. Watch his videos where he talks to the Libyan people, the guy had so much faith in them. Man loved some Libya. </p>

<p>And you are saying you aren&#39;t racist?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get it that you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m talking about. I get it that you react as you&#39;ve been conditioned to react. I&#39;m not blaming you, or anyone else who feels uncomfortable when race is talked about -- you&#39;ve been conditioned to feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And the zionist stuff again.</p>

<p>I try it a last time with you.</p>

<p>Zionist aren&#39;t a race there are group of people.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a jew to be a zionist you understand this please?</p>

<p>They Zionist are controlled by the same people that are controlling most of the western secret society&#39;s.</p>

<p>Which are the Rothschilds to a big part.</p>

<p>The Rothschild aren&#39;t jewish they are satanist.</p>

<p>Many jews are rejecting zionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now do you say that in the way that you mean this:</p>

<p>The elites, who are white, are trying to eliminate the whites at the bottom so that they can be the only whites and have their cherished bloodline be the only whites?  Then enslave the rest of the world under their power?  Because if that&#39;s the case, I can see that being what&#39;s going down.  At least, a part of it.  Agenda 21 could totally tie in with that as well.   </p>

<p>You should try and word it like that, I understand what you mean, but some of the slower kids around here have been brainwashed to equate what you&#39;re saying with blatant racism.  I don&#39;t think you hate other races, you just see the whites being forced down by popular culture, and to that, I say: mostly.</p>

<p>Although the other races also have predictive programming being shoved down their throats as well.  Think about gangsta culture and the &quot;diva&quot; mindset.  </p>
