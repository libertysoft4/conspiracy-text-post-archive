    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the government itself that will profit most.  It is the people in government who also have ties to big companies/corporations that do.  See: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQysjx1ncbE">Halliburton and Dick Cheney</a>.  </p>

<p>They see taxpayer money as this goldmine.  To get it they must transfer it from the government through contracts to their friends.  Then they may get their hands on this money directly from them, although I don&#39;t think that happens too often.  What seems to be more favorable is to wait until they retire from government.  Then all those people they helped to get filthy rich will give them a seat on their board or give them some cushy job so they can be rewarded for their help.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a &quot;scratch my back, I&#39;ll scratch yours&quot; kind of mentality.  Whether they plan on this from the get-go or they slowly get manipulated is the fun stuff we get to discuss in this sub.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copied from below. The last part is not directed at you but the other guy who said it was bullshit.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Lewis_v._United_States">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Lewis_v._United_States</a></p>

<p>There are no sharp criteria for determining whether an entity is a federal agency within the meaning of the Act, but the critical factor is the existence of federal government control over the &quot;detailed physical performance&quot; and &quot;day to day operation&quot; of that entity. United States v. Orleans, 425 U.S. 807, 814, 96 S.Ct. 1971, 1975, 48 L.Ed.2d 390 (1976), Logue v. United States, 412 U.S. 521, 528, 93 S.Ct. 2215, 2219, 37 L.Ed.2d 121 (1973). Other factors courts have considered include whether the entity is an independent corporation, Pearl v. United States, 230 F.2d 243 (10th Cir. 1956), Freeling v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 221 F.Supp. 955 (W.D.Okla.1962), aff&#39;d per curiam, 326 F.2d 971 (10th Cir. 1963), whether the government is involved in the entity&#39;s finances. Goddard v. District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency, 287 F.2d 343, 345 (D.C.Cir.1961), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 910, 81 S.Ct. 1085, 6 L.Ed.2d 235 (1961), Freeling v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 221 F.Supp. 955, and whether the mission of the entity furthers the policy of the United States, Goddard v. District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency, 287 F.2d at 345. Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks, and applying the relevant factors, we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA, but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.</p>

<p>Each Federal Reserve Bank is a separate corporation owned by commercial banks in its region. The stockholding commercial banks elect two thirds of each Bank&#39;s nine member board of directors. The remaining three directors are appointed by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the Reserve Banks, but direct supervision and control of each Bank is exercised by its board of directors. 12 U.S.C. § 301. The directors enact by-laws regulating the manner of conducting general Bank business, 12 U.S.C. § 341, and appoint officers to implement and supervise daily Bank activities. These activities include collecting and clearing checks, making advances to private and commercial entities, holding reserves for member banks, discounting the notes of member banks, and buying and selling securities on the open market. See 12 U.S.C. §§ 341-361.</p>

<p><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/680/1239/200393/">http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/680/1239/200393/</a></p>

<p>Now, do you understand that CORPORATIONS are in charge of of the US money supply, set interest rates amongst other things that not only affect the United States but also the entire world? Since the Reserve has its own board that acts outside of government, no president has elected the chairman, the Federal Reserve has elected the chairman themselves, not the other way round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re most welcome. Bookmark the law one for further use when the subject comes up again. It has been determined by the courts so it&#39;s not a conspiracy. I&#39;ll look into who the local banks are so you can determine who actually owns the Federal Reserve. If its local banks which it states then I suspect people like Bank Of America, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs etc and I have also read Wachovia may be involved.</p>

<p>Oh, so they don&#39;t refund their profits immediately to the US Treasury? And we are in disagreement as to who these &quot;shareholders&quot; are.

The fact you know about the fractional reserve mechanism means you are at least aware of the fact the entire system is built like a house of cards. Whether you care to admit it or not its nothing more than a giant ponzi scheme that has an offical name and is kept alive because the banks are too big to fail and the government has bailed them out. Just the fact that the US governments national debt stands at 16 trillion and is increasing by 3 billion each day is all the proof you need to prove the current system is broken and cannot be sustained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I honestly believe fractional reserve banking is the greatest invention of the 20th century next to the internet, you don&#39;t? You don&#39;t realize that you wouldn&#39;t enjoy such a high standard of living in this day and age if our monetary system wasn&#39;t constantly expanding? If we were tied to a worthless metal like gold everyone would still be living in the dark ages because there wouldn&#39;t be enough money to go around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The largest and most glaring problem in returning to the gold standard is that there is simply not enough gold in the world to cover the quantity of currency presently in existence. To put it another way, even if the US were somehow able to purchase the world&#39;s entire gold stocks (in itself an impossible proposition) there would still be nowhere near enough gold to cover the total value of dollars in existence. It is estimated that the total amount of gold that has been mined in the world is equal to about 142,000 metric tons.[13] Assuming a price of $32,500 per kilogram, that equals about $4.6 trillion; a little more than half of all circulating money and deposits in the United States. A return to the gold standard would require a massive devaluation of the US dollar, precisely the scenario that many gold bugs feel that the gold standard would prevent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More on how fiat is the superior system:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The advantage of a fiat currency is in theory to match the expansion of the money supply with the expansion of economic output rather than having the money supply expand arbitrarily whenever a Yukon Cornelius strikes gold. This helps prevent unwanted inflation from rapid, unexpected changes in the money supply. The reverse also applies in that fiat currency&#39;s elasticity can solve problems with deflation as well. The gold standard can become deflationary during a time of economic expansion due to its inelasticity and ultimately put a damper on growth. As population, the workforce, and overall economic output grow, if the money supply under a gold standard remained static, the demand for new money would outstrip existing stocks. Hence the cost of money, and things like payrolls, would become increasing difficult to maintain over time. An instance of this occurred during the &quot;Long Depression&quot; of the late 19th century.[29] This deflationary effect also played a role in the Great Depression. Nations that dropped the gold standard saw dramatic recoveries during the 1930s compared to those that didn&#39;t, which either continued to stagnate or decline slightly.[30] Ironically for libertarian advocates of the gold standard, Milton Friedman famously argued that the gold standard was a major factor in causing the Great Depression, contributing to the contraction of the money supply in 1929-1933.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that gold backed currency is flawed and would further increase the concentration of wealth but fiat money also has its setbacks. There are positives and negatives to fractional reserve banking, the most obvious setback being that it is based on confidence. At any point if enough people try to withdraw their money it would cause an economic meltdown. It works if banks keep a certain percentage of actual money in their vaults but during the 2008 collapse the percentage of money actually kept compared to money loaned out was ridiculously low. </p>

<p>Having an ever constantly expanded monetary system seems like a good idea but when you face the fact there is a finite number of resources out there inflation is the only real outcome. The more money is printed the less current money is worth . The current set-up of the central banking system is broken, countries are stuck in a never ending spiral of debt and there is no way to get out of it. The only solution seems to be lets borrow ourselves out of it which helps in the short term but just digs a deeper hole in the long run. Without reforming the central banking system the world is just going to get into more and more debt which it can never pay off and its coming to a point where you can&#39;t even take it seriously anymore. I mean the US are currently 26 trillion dollars in debt, within a decade or two their debt is going to be larger than the amount of money which exists in the world and whats going to happen then? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Herp derp. US court case finds the Federal Reserve to be a private corporation entity and only deemed to be Federal to avoid paying taxes.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Lewis_v._United_States">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Lewis_v._United_States</a></p>

<p>There are no sharp criteria for determining whether an entity is a federal agency within the meaning of the Act, but the critical factor is the existence of federal government control over the &quot;detailed physical performance&quot; and &quot;day to day operation&quot; of that entity. United States v. Orleans, 425 U.S. 807, 814, 96 S.Ct. 1971, 1975, 48 L.Ed.2d 390 (1976), Logue v. United States, 412 U.S. 521, 528, 93 S.Ct. 2215, 2219, 37 L.Ed.2d 121 (1973). Other factors courts have considered include whether the entity is an independent corporation, Pearl v. United States, 230 F.2d 243 (10th Cir. 1956), Freeling v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 221 F.Supp. 955 (W.D.Okla.1962), aff&#39;d per curiam, 326 F.2d 971 (10th Cir. 1963), whether the government is involved in the entity&#39;s finances. Goddard v. District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency, 287 F.2d 343, 345 (D.C.Cir.1961), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 910, 81 S.Ct. 1085, 6 L.Ed.2d 235 (1961), Freeling v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 221 F.Supp. 955, and whether the mission of the entity furthers the policy of the United States, Goddard v. District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency, 287 F.2d at 345. Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks, and applying the relevant factors, we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA, but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.</p>

<p>Each Federal Reserve Bank is a separate corporation owned by commercial banks in its region. The stockholding commercial banks elect two thirds of each Bank&#39;s nine member board of directors. The remaining three directors are appointed by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the Reserve Banks, but direct supervision and control of each Bank is exercised by its board of directors. 12 U.S.C. § 301. The directors enact by-laws regulating the manner of conducting general Bank business, 12 U.S.C. § 341, and appoint officers to implement and supervise daily Bank activities. These activities include collecting and clearing checks, making advances to private and commercial entities, holding reserves for member banks, discounting the notes of member banks, and buying and selling securities on the open market. See 12 U.S.C. §§ 341-361.</p>

<p><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/680/1239/200393/">http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/680/1239/200393/</a></p>

<p>Now, do you understand that CORPORATIONS are in charge of of the US money supply, set interest rates amongst other things that not only affect the United States but also the entire world? Since the Reserve has its own board that acts outside of government, no president has elected the chairman, the Federal Reserve has elected the chairman themselves, not the other way round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the government must borrow money to pay for wars that are not fully funded by taxes.  the people from whom the money is borrowed collect interest on the loan.  therefore, a large potential conflict of interest exists between industrial-scale money lenders and the people who control government spending - they can pay off members of government to increase spending, so that they will profit from increased interest on loans to government.</p>

<p>this is exactly the point where the attempts to cover up the details start.  the trick beyond this point is to identify who <em>controls</em> the U.S.&#39;s national debt.  the <em>legal ownership</em> of the debt is distributed among a huge number of organizations, because it has to appear to be organic and justifiable.  </p>

<p>there&#39;s also the issue of who owns military contractors.  some investigation will show significant overlap between these organizations, and the organizations owning the debt (mostly in the form of private banks).</p>

<p>tl:dr; the people that set up the government&#39;s lending outfit (Fed. Reserve), the Rothschilds, and their heavily compensated cronies.</p>

<p>if there was a criminal trial to pull out all the evidence, it would last months - maybe even years.   in terms of how much they had to complicate the set-up, they had two things to consider - (a) risk of public discovery (b) ease of recruiting people to help.</p>

<p>anything past there is a matter of tracing the edges of their psychology.  which is, of course, like staring into some kind of &quot;death vortex&quot; - absolutely nothing nice to think about there.  you want to talk about pent up anger and nightmarish fantasies of destroying mankind, then look at the people who are trying to enslave humanity.  </p>

<p>anyway, that&#39;s the answer.  government lending and military contractor ownership are the cash cows in this insane game, and they control them.</p>
