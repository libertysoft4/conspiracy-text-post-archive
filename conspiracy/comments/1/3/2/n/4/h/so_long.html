    <div class="md"><p>It seems like there&#39;s a significant amount of &quot;crazy conspiracies&quot; on the front page as of late, or stories that are clearly just looking for a conspiracy when there isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Right now we&#39;ve got the whistle-blowers who has been missing for 8 hours (he&#39;s already been found, alive); the story about FEMA camps being set up outside New York, as if its some conspiracy that a disaster-response agency would respond to a natural disaster; a video about Rumsfeld being a lizard (possibly a joke, Poe&#39;s Law is a bitch); a post about a book that&#39;s coming out detailing one man&#39;s coma-induced visions of a multiverse; an Indianapolis explosion that&#39;s received no media coverage, despite actually receiving ridiculous media coverage...</p>

<p>There are genuine conspiracies out there, with good evidence behind them. Theories worth discussing. But the reason conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t taken seriously is due to a fallacy of generalization. You could present the most well-designed argument for a 9/11 cover-up theory, but people may still ask if you brought your tin-foil hat with you. And suddenly nothing you say matters, and the people behind the cover-up win.</p>

<p>Its a very fine line to tread. On the one hand, associating your community with any of the legitimately <em>crazy</em> theories means instant decreditation for the theories which have evidence. But, on the other hand, every theory in any field comes about because someone is asking questions; ignoring the crazies could mean that we&#39;d miss something legitimate that they put forward.</p>

<p>This is relevant to the topic at hand because as the population of this subreddit grows, we gain people at either end of the spectrum. We gain people who are here because they genuinely believe Rumsfeld is a lizard, and they&#39;ll make the community look terrible by talking about it. We gain government agents who are just browsing as part of their job; maybe they upvote the crazies to discredit legitimate discussion. We gain all manor of people, and this furthers the fallacy of generalization. </p>

<p>And just as these last elections have shown; when communities get larger, the middle-ground is the first segment to disappear. The middle-ground is where all the best discussion happens, because its where people of conflicting opinions can find something similar to talk about and agree upon. The people there learn to walk that fine line, and when they&#39;re gone then it leaves a community that isn&#39;t worth participating in. </p>

<p>Do you know of a different subreddit that would be better to visit? Or is there a new subreddit that we should start where you can provide only facts based on conspiracies. Meaning, when we know a conspiracy is Bull, we no longer discuss that one and move onto more important ones</p>

<p>When it&#39;s in written form and I don&#39;t have tone a demeanor to go on, yes, you must state what you mean. No one is going to &quot;get it&quot;, Cochise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there isn&#39;t like a major paranormal sub or anything like that. But the problem is that <strong>every</strong> sub-reddit is a circlejerk. You don&#39;t go there unless you want to be apart of that sub. So if you go against any of the &#39;status quo&#39; parts of any sub, you&#39;ll be down voted as such.</p>

<p>There is no forum that allows for free flowing, thought provoking discussion, because the second there&#39;s a debate, people just start throwing up votes and down votes around and bury it - so intelligent discussion is impossible.</p>
