    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kindaa what it seems could be possible (notice I don&#39;t wanna speak in absolutes).
With the UK, US, and Australia supporting Israel while Russia and Egypt support Palestine. I could see this as the start of a larger conflict. Especially, if the US goes through with the oil embargo. </p>

<p>But, whether the US does or not, this violence has just started and won&#39;t stop anytime soon. Hamas had now had 2 senior officials killed in the past few days. They won&#39;t want to stop and Israel just looks like they&#39;re gearing to fight. 75k reserves being called upon by Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be terrified. This is empowering to know that we can see what&#39;s going on. Before, we wouldn&#39;t know about any of this. I think it&#39;s always been a police state, except that now there is more exposure. Which could bring more freedom.</p>

<p>Whether you believe in God or not, you have to notice that these events coincide with the book of revelation. (Don&#39;t assume I believe the rapture is coming) But, like I said, the events occurring are explained in the bible. Maybe it&#39;s because the elites believe they are fulfilling God&#39;s word or maybe it&#39;s just a divine plan, but regardless, it&#39;s in there and it&#39;s occurring according to scripture. And I don&#39;t think anyone can say I&#39;m wrong because I&#39;m not saying I know anything. I&#39;m only pointing out similarities I see and making educated guesses. I don&#39;t know anything more than the next guy, i&#39;m just pointing out observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s funny. Glee, a few weeks ago, had a quote about how Twitter was predicted to happen in the book of revelations as well as in insinuating that the Book of revelations is being repeated. </p>

<p>There was also a season of Dexter last year, that was about a killer who was reenacting the revelations. </p>

<p>More proof that TV predicts the future so that the elite can laugh at us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahah, dude. I love Dexter. I just started watching last season and now i&#39;m watching them all. That show is just so intense and has great writers. </p>

<p>But, yeah. With all this mass media and online live streaming, we have reached the tipping point in media saturation. Meaning, the world will be able to watch the events unfold. It says in the bible that we had to reach this point first, so that everyone could see what was going down. But, I still think we have ways to go, it&#39;s only the beginning of the end, which will produce another beginning. Nothing ta fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once we see persecution of the church is when he is about to return. And I mean extreme persecution of those who believe and follow the teachings of Jesus (Yahshua). Like, It will come do the point where either you deny Him or die. And that&#39;s when christ is getting close. (At least to my understanding, I&#39;m not claiming I know when it will happen because no one does, not even the angels) Right now, I think it&#39;s just the beginning and sure everyone has been saying christ will soon return. (And when He does return it won&#39;t certainly be the end.) But have they seen the culmination of events that we have along with the space weather and sudden earth changes that we&#39;ve seen? 
Also, Israel became a nation on the exact day that it was predicted in the bible. You can google this.</p>

<p>If you really want to go into the bible subject. Then you have to recognize that it was written in a (now) dead language and that people will never be able to understand it&#39;s complete message. Also, that it&#39;s a copy of copy of a translation of a translation of a translation, etc. </p>

<p>So, even if I was able to elaborate, how would either of us know i&#39;m correct. I&#39;m just simply trying to make observations. If you want to know how these events were predicted, then i&#39;ll let you research that. Because of the complexity behind this issue I can&#39;t even answer your question without getting into all sorts of side conversations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>go back to r/atheism. If you don&#39;t believe in God, then I feel really sorry for you. I&#39;m not going to pointlessly try to defend my position. You have a right to your opinion and if you think i&#39;m the asshat, that&#39;s fine. Your judgement will come and that&#39;s something you&#39;ll have to deal with by yourself.  </p>

<p>So, while you claim I believe in fairytales and continue to attack christians, i&#39;ll be here. Just respecting others opinions, trying to help make this world more tolerable and helping to spread positive information. Not trying to alter anyone&#39;s opinion, because I don&#39;t claim to have the answers or any answers at all. So continue to try and be the most superior human with the most superior opinion and scoff at the opinion of others. You&#39;ll definitely help our race progress.</p>

Make no mistake, if the Israeli military makes their move, it will be a slaughter.

<p>Once Israel has finally eradicated the state of Palestine, will they stop there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same old shit for the most part, though there ARE some differences this time around.</p>

<p>The Arab Spring has led to more vocal support for Gazans from Egypt (though I would bet my life savings that it stays purely vocal and humanitarian), which is a bit unusual; with that said, the military still firmly holds power in Egypt, and will not risk that by involving themselves in the fighting itself.</p>

<p>The biggest change I see, and something which I think may come back to bite Hamas in the ass, is the engagement of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with rockets.  This is a MAJOR game changer for a lot of reasons.</p>

<p>When rocket attacks could only reach the south of Israel, there was impetus for restraint (or at least the Israeli version of it); while sustained rocket attacks could largely paralyze southern cities, casualties were limited and the economic impact was sustainable.</p>

<p>With rockets reaching Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, this goes entirely out the window.  While I doubt Hamas has enough Fajr stockpiles mounted to launch any sort of sustained bombardment, the mere threat of paralysis of Israel&#39;s economic centers will virtually guarantee a harsh Israeli response.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the time was right for these missiles to be launched; with Fajr stockpiles assuredly limited, and a guaranteed Israeli escalation, this may have been a tactical overstep for Hamas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the &quot;kikes&quot; in question are Khazars who&#39;ve never lived there before, but believe they are entitled to occupy Palestine because their distant ancestors converted to Judaism. Ironically, the true, shephardic jews who <em>have</em> been living there all along (thus having no need for a <em>Jewish state</em>), also suffer under the Khazar occupation, which has (even more ironically) killed tens of thousands of them in medical experiments similar to those the Khazars allege the Germans used them for in WWII. The occupation of Palestine is not just committing genocide against Palestinian Muslims, but Palestinian Jews as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once we see persecution of the church is when he is about to return. And I mean extreme persecution of those who believe and follow the teachings of Jesus (Yahshua). Like, It will come do the point where either you deny Him or die. And that&#39;s when christ is getting close. (At least to my understanding, I&#39;m not claiming I know when it will happen because no one does, not even the angels) Right now, I think it&#39;s just the beginning and sure everyone has been saying christ will soon return. (And when He does return it won&#39;t certainly be the end.) But have they seen the culmination of events that we have along with the space weather and sudden earth changes that we&#39;ve seen? 
Also, Israel became a nation on the exact day that it was predicted in the bible. You can google this.</p>

<p>If you really want to go into the bible subject. Then you have to recognize that it was written in a (now) dead language and that people will never be able to understand it&#39;s complete message. Also, that it&#39;s a copy of copy of a translation of a translation of a translation, etc. </p>

<p>So, even if I was able to elaborate, how would either of us know i&#39;m correct. I&#39;m just simply trying to make observations. If you want to know how these events were predicted, then i&#39;ll let you research that. Because of the complexity behind this issue I can&#39;t even answer your question without getting into all sorts of side conversations.</p>
