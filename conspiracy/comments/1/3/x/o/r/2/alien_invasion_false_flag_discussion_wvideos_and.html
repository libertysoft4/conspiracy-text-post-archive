<p>In order to maintain the size of the current ruling class, more profits must  be had. But we have exceeded the age where both human rights and the level of profitability that can be had from adhering to human rights is acceptable for supplanting the elites with their needs. </p>

<p>And so, they work to get control of you and me, so that we will agree that we have no rights as human beings. The elite own everything but our souls, and would have us submit to indefinite slavery to allow them to maintain their way of life - at the expense of your own. </p>

<p>They do not control everything of power in the world.  I don&#39;t know where you got that idea from, but it is incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either you don&#39;t believe one or the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tend to not &quot;believe&quot; anything really.  I work hard at staying away from belief.  I have an <em>understanding</em> - something much greater - that they don&#39;t control everything in the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is shitty about the world to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t enough room on here to answer that.  Neither you nor I have the patience to really go through that answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you not have food?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Access to unimaginable bounties of data?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of data? yes.  &quot;Unimaginable bounties&quot; of it?  No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shelter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you really lack for that you feel makes this a shitty state of life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea that you would think or even insinuate that the few things you mentioned here are sufficient to keep any and everyone who has those things from feeling shitty about the world is enough to keep me from talking to you about my experiences, for it seems likely that you would simply not understand them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or is it just that you&#39;re jealous of rich people and have to find a way to convince yourself that they are evil so you can feel happy about having less material wealth than them? Masking your own built in greed?</p>

<p>This is an extremely shallow assumption on your part.  It indicates a deep, deep chasm of ignorance - a very real lack of awareness that requires much more help at fixing than I am willing to provide here.</p>

<p>They being TPTB?  Is that what you&#39;re asking?  What do TPTB control?  What kind of a question is this exactly?  Is it a trolling question or a real inquiry?  If it&#39;s a trolling question, then neither shall I answer it, nor shall I persist much longer in this conversation.  If it&#39;s a real inquiry, then it indicates that you yourself are unaware of the extent to which this society is controlled and contrived.  If you are unaware of that fact, then, again, I really don&#39;t have enough time or patience to walk you through all the many examples that exist on this planet over the course of current recorded history showing the many FFs and contrivances that have occurred specifically designed to covertly manipulate the populace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is their goal or purpose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot say that I know for sure what exactly it is.  That I know that there is contrivance going on does not necessarily have to include a knowledge of exactly <em>what</em> that contrivance is or what its specific goals are.</p>

<p>I, of course, have various ideas as to what the goals are - some of which are well based and have a foundation of solid research to back them up, others of which are more speculative on my part - but what <em>specifically</em> is their goal is something so convoluted and complex that I don&#39;t think anyone would be well-advised in alleging that they have &quot;the answer&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t consider the internet to be full of unimaginable bounties of data?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not.  If it&#39;s on the internet, it&#39;s OBVIOUSLY been imagined by at least someone.  That much is simply logical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Serious?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Serious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have almost all the scientific learning of human history available anywhere</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is <em>much</em> information indicating that this is far from the truth and that human civilization, contrary to the rosy perspective that most people are indoctrinated to believe, has in fact been in a state of not evolution but <em>devolution</em> for quite a long time now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>plus so very much more. What more could you possibly expect?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truth that is more readily available and accessible to all.</p>

<p>This is by <em>far</em> nowhere near the case on this planet.</p>

<p>Awww.  I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re not spoonfed the information that exists in Gerber baby formula manner so that you can ingest it like a dutiful sheep.  It seems to <em>really</em> get you upset when you&#39;re not given information in a manner that you can unquestioningly digest.  I guess you&#39;re just too used to the drivel you call &quot;science&quot; to understand what true critical assessment and responsibility is.  Sorry to butt hurt you, little baby.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry.  I won&#39;t bother wasting my time any more with you - scaring you by making you have to actually <em>think</em> (gasp!  no!) lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4QASM1IAYU&amp;amp;feature=relmfu">Book 49 of 106</a>.  Definitely LOTS of material to get through on it, so I&#39;m doing it in a piecemeal manner, but going through it via the method that I linked here kind of allows me to actually listen to it and then read along if there are any areas that I want to go through again - so it works out.</p>

<p>A lot of the information in The Ra Material certainly does indeed mirror what HH said - so much so that I wondered for a moment if HH himself didn&#39;t just actually <em>steal</em> the material (or at least mirror the general &quot;feel&quot; of it) from The Law Of One and use it for his own stuff.  Honestly, I actually don&#39;t get the feeling that he did, however.  Especially when I came across information like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGD4HMVtvEk">this long video right here</a> that, in its own way and in various areas, absolutely corroborates much of the information that both HH and The Ra Material mentioned.</p>

<p>That last link I included is both very long AND has a bit of stuff that I actually <em>don&#39;t</em> agree with at all.  It&#39;s also a bit dated and the production value definitely comes across as a bit &quot;cheesy&quot;.  However, there is enough interesting corollary information between what is said in it and the information contained in both HH&#39;s data and The Ra Material that it leads me to feel that there <em>is</em> indeed at least some significant level of truth in much of what HH mentioned.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about cross-referencing the material and data you find.  If you have various disparaging, unconnected sources all mentioning similar things, then it gives the veracity of information that&#39;s being imparted a LOT more weight and credibility.</p>

<p>However, i&#39;m beginning to struggle at this level and I would like to run something by you.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t compute to me that, according to the data, people that won&#39;t ascend (positvely or negatively) will have a mystical experience/dream and wake up as if nothing happened. How could they wake up as if nothing happened if let&#39;s say 1 person 10 should be gone.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I can definitely understand that.</p>

<p>I am more accustomed to reading an actual, physical book in front of me and not on a computer as well.  However, the fact that 1) the link at least has a MILDLY tolerable computerized voice reciting the words slightly helps - and I actually otherwise despise computerized voices.  I think they sound utterly stupid, and simply don&#39;t listen to them otherwise.  Also, 2) I&#39;m poor <em>and</em> cheap so I didn&#39;t look into how much it would cost to actually <em>buy</em> the books.  Last but not least, 3) I&#39;ve decided to allow myself to be a bit lazy and just passively listen to the text as opposed to actually <em>read</em> it (which, ultimately, gives you a lot of the same information anyway since you <em>are</em> going through the words themselves).  These are all factors that have ultimately caused me to opt for the particular method I&#39;m using to go through the material as of late. :)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  That indeed seems like a point of particular contention.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a breakdown of what will happen to my limited understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>About a third of humanity whose general energy is something like 54% or more &quot;service to others&quot; will go to a 4th density positive realm at some other location in the galaxy or even further beyond in the cosmos where literally everyone will have greatly advanced abilities, understanding, connection etc.</p></li>
<li><p>About another third (? - Not sure about the exact percentage on this one - don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a third or more or less) who are something like 91% or more &quot;service to <em>self</em>&quot; will go to a 3d density negative area/planet somewhere else in the galaxy or further out in the cosmos which will be practically indistinguishable from planet Earth, but where the negative crap that exists on this planet will not only continue, but actually get much, much worse.  This will give those on that planet the opportunity to see the effects of a &quot;service to self&quot; way of being and they will get the opportunity to work their way through such a realm.</p></li>
<li><p>The remainder of the population will remain here on this planet, but will undergo a temporary spell within which they will enter a state of suspended animation of sorts, have a type of mystical experience letting them know what awaits them as they progress further along, and will then wake up with no conscious recollection of the experience, yet feeling a sense of wonder and renewed spiritual vigor as the experience will indeed still be influencing and effecting them subconsciously.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The approximate number of people that, according to this theory, will undergo this last type of transformation will either be a third of the entire human population of approximately 7 billion (i.e. roughly 2-2.5 billion), <em>or</em> it will actually be <em>more</em> people if my estimation regarding the number of people that will go to 3d density negative was overestimated and the number going there is actually <em>less</em>.</p>

<p>Either way, it is fair to say that, according to this theory, there will be a significant reduction in the number of humans that are on this planet - going from about 7 billion to less than 3 billion.</p>

<p>This is something that pretty much EVERYONE will notice right?  Right.  It would definitely seem so.</p>

<p>Okay...so how does one actually <em>account</em> for that drastic reduction right?  <em>That</em> is the question you&#39;re asking and trying to get at/resolve in your head.  This seems to be a bit of an issue or problem to me as well.  My mind has the capability of being a very benefit of the doubt giving one when it wants to be, however.  Not necessarily &quot;incredulous&quot;, but &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; giving.  I like to try to imagine what circumstances <em>would</em> indeed need to occur for a thing to  even <em>possibly</em> take place or be true in this manner.  With that in mind, I could imagine that either there might be some sort of major war or catastrophe - flood, disease, famine - that would wipe out a TON of the population.</p>

<p>The thing with this theory, however, is that - given that today <em>is</em> officially December 1st - it would seem that we would have about 20 days until all this happens...and if it really WERE to be any one of these things like disease, famine, etc sufficient to wipe out THAT many people from the face of this planet (whether they actually die or go to another realm/density, who knows)...then one would think that we as a people would have ALREADY begun getting at least <em>some</em> kinds of signs or something that &quot;shit&#39;s about to hit the fan&quot; in a way that no one currently on this planet has ever previously experienced since we ARE that close to the actual date right?</p>

<p>And well...I don&#39;t know about you, but my life seems about as normal and average and mundane as it&#39;s ever previously been.  There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything different &quot;feeling&quot; about things to me.  Perhaps we&#39;re all just a week or so away from &quot;things&quot; finally beginning to happen, and perhaps I&#39;m just not a very sensitive type, but - again - I don&#39;t feel anything too particularly different inside of me or in the environment around me that leads me to believe that this life will be anything any different than &quot;an average life&quot; where I live and eventually die.</p>

<p>Another thought that occurs to me regarding just how something like this could be possible is that, well, birds of a feather flock together right?  That means that it is likely that the circle of associates, acquaintances, friends, loved, ones, etc that people keep are likely ALL in the same &quot;group type&quot; that will move toward one realm or the other.  Perhaps the change might not be all THAT noticeable if you AND your entire family and friends all end up in the same place, right?  This way, the change(s) can occur and many might not even notice it because their life hasn&#39;t really changed all that much...because EVERYONE in their family/circle moved along <em>with</em> them and are still around.</p>

<p>Even so, however, it seems that one should notice <em>some</em> changes, right?  You would think that sooner or later you would find out that - as you turn on the TV and/or go on Youtube - two thirds of <em>the entire population of EARTH</em> is gone.</p>

<p>Yes.  Indeed this is an issue that I&#39;ve questioned as well.</p>

<p>The good news is that we&#39;ll all find out in about 20 days what if anything is going to happen. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I can tell you without being dismissed is that a while ago I stumbled upon the link I gave you, after having been in &quot;monitoring mode&quot; for some time prior to it. </p>

<p>Meaning that I felt like I looked up most that was available about all kinds of these fringe subjects, from nwo to aliens (which apparantly always ends up the spiritual .. think project chemelot).</p>

<p>The interview, abstract and full of plotholes as it may be, seemed to tie a lot of things together and the general concept which is being communicated fits as a framework on most things I can think of.</p>

<p>FYI: after that, currently, I started looking into the mentionned ra channelings. It is extremely long, abstract and requires a truckload of salt. I&#39;m reading it slowly because even with the objective of entertaining an idea without accepting it, it&#39;s quite heavy to take in.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Just sharing some of the rare possible answers which I found about &quot;beyond the nwo&quot;.</p>

<p>Ignore is bliss might apply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think a monetary collapse will come first which would definitely bring about chaos on a massive scale here in the US. As far as my research goes, the US was set up to fail from the start of the &quot;13&quot; original colonies..13 because we all know the significance of the number 13. If you don&#39;t, <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bloodlines/index.htm">here</a> is a breakdown of the bloodlines. The US is essentially Babylon, set up for destruction for the bringing about of the New World Order. (if I am wrong please correct me, but this is just from my understanding of my research).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree that the US is a modern Babylonian empire but I disagree that it was initially set up to become that. The founding fathers such as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson seem to have had a very different ideal in mind than what the US became. The character of the US changed fundamentally when its currency has appropriated by the financial elite.</p>

<p>The negative associations with the number 13 are a modern superstition. If you go back further, for example by examining the significance of the number 13 in Mayan cosmology (Hunbatz Men - The 8 Calendars of the Maya) or in Hebrew biblical gematria (Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh&#39;s writings and lectures on the numbers 13, 7, and 137), a very different meaning emerges.</p>

<li><p>Government covertly sets up alien FF.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Aliens&quot; (i.e. the government masquerading as ETs unbeknownst to a dumb, unsuspecting public) start killing everyone left and right.</p></li>
<li><p>The public freaks out.  Everyone absolutely SCCREEEAAAMS for the government with its big guns and ammo to help and protect them.</p></li>
<li><p>The government says &quot;Okay, people!  We&#39;ll absolutely help you against this terrible threat!  However, in order for us to help you, you must allow us to do &#39;X, Y, &amp; Z&#39;!&quot;</p></li>

<p>Woo hoo!</p>

<p>However, after the dust has settled, the population comes to realize that the &quot;X, Y, &amp; Z&quot; they agreed to involved involuntarily tagging everyone with a microchip that not only tracks and monitors your every moment in life, but can essentially &quot;shut you off&quot; (i.e. kill you) for whatever reason TPTB choose or decide.</p>

<p>Welcome to the NWO, courtesy of an &quot;Alien Invasion&quot; FF that TPTB got the public to buy into and seek &quot;help&quot; from.</p>

<p>I think they would hold on to that move until there has been more unification and it could be useful in accepting a more global defense force.</p>

<p>Most People are compartmentalized so they don&#39;t need to control everyone.</p>

<p>Example you know as journalist you can&#39;t write about 9/11 is a inside job because this would get you fired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree that the US is a modern Babylonian empire but I disagree that it was initially set up to become that. The founding fathers such as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson seem to have had a very different ideal in mind than what the US became. The character of the US changed fundamentally when its currency has appropriated by the financial elite.</p>

<p>The negative associations with the number 13 are a modern superstition. If you go back further, for example by examining the significance of the number 13 in Mayan cosmology (Hunbatz Men - The 8 Calendars of the Maya) or in Hebrew biblical gematria (Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh&#39;s writings and lectures on the numbers 13, 7, and 137), a very different meaning emerges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4QASM1IAYU&amp;amp;feature=relmfu">Book 49 of 106</a>.  Definitely LOTS of material to get through on it, so I&#39;m doing it in a piecemeal manner, but going through it via the method that I linked here kind of allows me to actually listen to it and then read along if there are any areas that I want to go through again - so it works out.</p>

<p>A lot of the information in The Ra Material certainly does indeed mirror what HH said - so much so that I wondered for a moment if HH himself didn&#39;t just actually <em>steal</em> the material (or at least mirror the general &quot;feel&quot; of it) from The Law Of One and use it for his own stuff.  Honestly, I actually don&#39;t get the feeling that he did, however.  Especially when I came across information like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGD4HMVtvEk">this long video right here</a> that, in its own way and in various areas, absolutely corroborates much of the information that both HH and The Ra Material mentioned.</p>

<p>That last link I included is both very long AND has a bit of stuff that I actually <em>don&#39;t</em> agree with at all.  It&#39;s also a bit dated and the production value definitely comes across as a bit &quot;cheesy&quot;.  However, there is enough interesting corollary information between what is said in it and the information contained in both HH&#39;s data and The Ra Material that it leads me to feel that there <em>is</em> indeed at least some significant level of truth in much of what HH mentioned.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about cross-referencing the material and data you find.  If you have various disparaging, unconnected sources all mentioning similar things, then it gives the veracity of information that&#39;s being imparted a LOT more weight and credibility.</p>
