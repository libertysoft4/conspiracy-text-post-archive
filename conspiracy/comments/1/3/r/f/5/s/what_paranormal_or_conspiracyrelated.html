    <div class="md"><p>Television. Television is the main driver in deadening the sense of the mind. And because so many people only believe in the mind, their power to affect their reality become dependent on their inputs. </p>

<p>This is why television <a href="http://www.henrymakow.com/opiate-of-the-masses-televis.html">PROGRAMMING</a> was retooled after a study by one <a href="http://www.jayhanson.us/page24.htm">Herbert Krugman</a> found that television puts human beings into a suggestive state within a minute of watching, wherein the subconscious absorbs ALL messages being sent to it regardless of sex, race, or creed. </p>

<p>Turn it off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does that have anything to do with the fact that if I sleep in silence, I have crazy dreams. Many of which are sleep paralysis or just fucked up. However, I purposefully turn on the TV at night to give noise. A radio isn&#39;t enough though because it doesn&#39;t give off a &quot;presence&quot; like a TV does. Like that high pitched noise I guess.
Not to get too weird here but my friends say that electronic devices interfere with ghosts, which is where I think my dreams mainly come from. Do you have any more information on this phenomenon? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Yes it does. Embrace the dreams. Your subconscious is trying to communicate something to you. It might just be warning you of the mental paralysis that it&#39;s experiencing when you inundate it with programming all night.</p>

<p>Let me guess, you always wake up tired? And then you&#39;re shocked that it feels like you didn&#39;t sleep at all. Guess what? You kind of didn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the opposite though. Sorry for my bad communication. I only have sleep paralysis in the silence. I do think it tries to tell me things but it scares me. The TV is kinda like my guard at night to keep me from dreaming. I kinda wanted to stop dreaming because I was getting sick of waking up in fear all the time.
It is true though. I normally don&#39;t feel like I slept. It was all just a dull roar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t ask you to face your fears. But television isn&#39;t doing you any favors, trust me. That you think it&#39;s a GUARD is proof it&#39;s programming is effective. </p>

<p>Turn it off for a week, see if you don&#39;t sleep better. Don&#39;t think about what&#39;s happened to you in the past, the past is irrelevant. Learn about meditation, do some before you sleep. As you begin to assert your OWN control over your reality, the energies that try to wrest that control from you will lose power over you. </p>

<p>Again, I cannot make you do anything. But I can tell you that turning off television and doing some internal exploration is quite a bit more rewarding than the haze you get from overnight programming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any external stimulus is going to interfere (to some degree) with your minds normal nighttime patterns of &quot;re-processing&quot; whatever data it&#39;s holding. Even though you&#39;re sleeping, your senses are still somewhat &quot;aware&quot; and will instinctively transmit any new stimuli to your brain. </p>

<p>Silence produces better dreams because it allows your brain to focus-inward better.. and your dreams feel more vivid.. and your sleep patterns (REM and other frequencies) are allowed to cycle more naturally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny you say that.  I hate the electronical devices which, with every new model has a light that gets brighter and brighter. WHY. Do i really need to know that the tv or printer is still on. I mean is there NO other way to let me know other than a green or red light that can light the whole room at 3am. It has a purpose but WHY.  BUt thank fully if those fail I have either the light from a smoke detector 7 ft above my head or the warm glow from a lamp post on the city street. We are lookign for new sources of energy and get wasting so much more. Didnt mean to gripe but come on. Good post though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I keep seeing private accounts coming on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and datamining who has positions on what conspiracy theories over the past few months. And while I&#39;m sure 5% of them are true seekers, it reinforces the fact that reddit is under surveillance by any number of disinfo groups. </p>

<p>OP, I&#39;m not necessarily talking about you, per se. But I have watched as people making inquiries not unlike your own are exposed as shills, disinfo agents, and psyop aggressors. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s definitely a conspiracy theory that is real. And why is it important? Because it reinforces indirectly the power that people have to crush these cowardly, backwards organizations intent on maintaining Human oppression and retarding progress. </p>

<p>They cannot win, and their participants will be buried with their  outdated organizations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm.  If I&#39;d known that I may have phrased my inquiry differently I guess.  I&#39;m only seeking the truth that those organizations you speak of suppress, in my opinion.  Mostly I read books and articles on this subject (as opposed to having blind faith in every poorly done website with contradictory theories), because I feel it&#39;s important to be more skeptical than not, so I don&#39;t fall for any old crap such as the disinformation/misinformation I know is everywhere.  But if others are doing the same thing I am, they will have come up with similar theories with hard-to-refute evidence, even if it&#39;s just a good book.  That is what I am seeking.  I myself have had to change some of my beliefs, so I&#39;m also seeking to hone my analytic skills, I guess.
Heck, look at my history, even my handle betrays me as an otaku.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that the first thing that comes to mind is that we are not alone in the Universe. I say that from a personal experience: One day when I was in high school I was gazing outside the window and then suddenly in the sky appeared at least 8 orbs of light that were moving at an incredible speed and in a geometric formation. I was totally speechless and I even thought I was imagining until I look to my left and I see a girl looking at them too, so I asked her are you seeing this and she was like yes! Now this is just one personal example, but if you factor in the millions of other sightings from other people all over the world throughout history, then something tangible must be out there. There is a documentary that will be coming soon called Sirius that will have testimony from verified government insiders about the reality of other intelligent life forms. In my opinion, the government withholds this information because it does not bode well with its agenda to keep us dumbed down and easily controlled.  I would say at least 90 percent of the people here in USA are wage slaves who work at least 8 hours per day in a stressful job, then come back to &quot;relax&quot; and watch TV only to be subliminally programmed on how to think, spend their hard earned cash, etc... No one has the time anymore to contemplate who they are and what is their purpose for being here...</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t make the mistake of correlating UFO with ALIEN. Those &quot;orbs&quot; you may have seen could&#39;ve just as easily been us humans testing some currently classified technology. The Stealth bomber was in production for 2 decades before it was revealed to the public. What do you think they are working on now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.  Nobody knows what ghosts are.  They have merely use the term &quot;ghosts&quot; to describe the sensations that they perceive at this level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but &quot;ghost&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;infrasound hallucination that we falsely believe is the disembodied spirit of a dead person,&quot; it means &quot;disembodied spirit of a dead person.&quot; Seeing the difference? You can say that people mistakenly believe that these are disembodied spirits, but you can&#39;t say &quot;disembodied spirits are real! Except they&#39;re just sounds that make our brains do funny things, not actually disembodied spirits.&quot;</p>

<p>I get where you&#39;re trying to go with the semiotic connection, but the word has a meaning independent of the specific sensation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in Aliens, Extra-Dimensional beings, Angels and Demons. I simply refuse to believe that the millions of accounts of such beings are all fabrications. Where there is smoke there&#39;s fire and these ideas had to have had some real life inspiration. There are definitely made up stories here and there but I just find it difficult to believe that all of them are.</p>

<p>While It may not be &quot;fringe&quot;, although the massive rise in militant atheism might make it seem so, I do believe there probably is some sort of prime creator of existence. I don&#39;t claim it as fact but that is what I personally believe based on my experiences until I see undeniable evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>As I said before, when there&#39;s smoke there is fire, so I believe there is at least some truth to most of the big things out there like UFOs, ghosts, ESP, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humanity is older than we know, and neither are we the first intelligent civilization on earth. However, I believe this is out of ignorance and a pitifully incomplete fossil record, rather than malice and conspiracy.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know half of what the brain actually does. In not terribly sure myself, but I&#39;m almost completely sure telepathic phenomena exists in a fashion were haven&#39;t scientifically noticed yet.</p>

<p>Geoengineering is real, but the people behind it believe they&#39;re doing good, like Thalidomide or bloodletting out other practices that begin with the best intentions but have horrible consequences.</p>

<p>Many Americans (and possibly others, but I can only speak from experience) are living a completely manufactured life. From birth to death, their lives revolve around various manufactured products. Diapers, baby clothes, toys, packaged food, picture books, textbooks, bathroom supplies, lawn care, home improvement, caskets, every single thing they every encounter being preordained by suits in a board room somewhere, programmed by television. While it&#39;s completely possible not to, so few people even realize this is going on that it just keeps going. Television is almost entirely used to reinforce this.</p>

<p>Psychedelic drugs are way more significant than misty people would be willing to admit, and if their use were as widespread as in the past, western religion would not exist. Furthermore, the genocide of the various american peoples was motivated by the fact that direct spiritual gnosis was a part of the culture, instead of having a patriarch dispense the approved rhetoric.</p>

<p>9/11 was carried out by Mossad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spirit guide stuff, and its related material such as higher dimensional &quot;souls&quot; and consciousness. That said, I don&#39;t outright live my life by this - yet - but I&#39;ve had several convincing encounters with evidence, personally. Briefly, one being an interaction in a dream where I had a word in a foreign language of which I have no knowledge revealed to me. It was presented to me in our letter system and I google searched to find the proper transliteration in any random language, and it was precisely a foreign word with a relevant meaning to the question I was asking in my dream. I can&#39;t argue against that and some other things. Still investigating but I believe our consciousness, souls, what have you come from higher dimensions that we cant perceive in this state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good. Glad you&#39;re getting downvoted for this. It&#39;s an honorary degree based on good deeds...There are only 32degrees. The 33rd is nothing more it&#39;s just recognition by your lodge of the good deeds you&#39;ve done that&#39;s all. Many people turn it down and lead normal lives.
