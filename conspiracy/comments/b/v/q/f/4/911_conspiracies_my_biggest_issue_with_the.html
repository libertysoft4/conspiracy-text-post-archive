<p>Yeah, but I have more faith in man-kind. They can still shoot planes out of the sky and go bust a cap in the middle east. Less enthusiasm from the poplace sure, but &#39;appropriate&#39; embelishments would get it done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Cheney had ordered the flight heading to the Pentagon to be shot down, it would almost certainly have to be covered up from the media and general public.</p>

<p>Even if standard protocol says that a hijacked suicide plane is an enemy weapon and should be destroyed, the American public would never accept it.</p>

<p>It would absolutely have to be covered up in some way. Perhaps with a feel-good story involving heroic everyday Americans standing up and sacrificing themselves for Freedom and Democracy! *sniff* Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for unconvincing wreckage of plane.</p>

<p>Hell, we could even make a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481522/">movie</a> about it to further &quot;catapult the propaganda&quot; into people&#39;s minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably 300-400 souls were involved in the 911 attacks.   Maybe a few dozen were expendable laborers/patsies and a few dozen actual Americans were duped into highly compartmentalized involvement.   But the vast majority of participants were Israelis or American dual-citizens who remain silent out of patriotic loyalty to Israel.   This isn&#39;t at all implausilbe, seeing how a hundred times that number remained silent about America&#39;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; nuclear project.    </p>

<p>I doubt if there are ANY particpants who participated only for a bribe.  Any still-living Gentiles are being blackmailed with assassination threats or videotapes what would ensure their prosecution for treason (that is, if people were actually prosecuted for treason any more.).  </p>

<p>companies / organisations that did the bomb-riggings - as well as people that saw / suspected <em>anything</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve thought the same myself.</p>

<p>But another big thing I have considered is if you were trying to take down an opposing government (using terrorism), the <em>best</em> thing you could do, would be to attack your target, but claim you didnt do it.</p>

<p>i.e. Al-Qaeda  saying &quot;no we didn&#39;t fly those planes&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The families WERE bribed; they were bought off with court settlements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we&#39;re clear you mean the families of people on &quot;supposed&quot; or &quot;actual&quot; flights?</p>

<p>Interesting theory...</p>

<p>But (assuming no plane) the people not being dead would be an issue. (Did the govt. kill them some other way) and once again, being bought off is expensive and a <em>big deal</em> like this wouldn&#39;t keep <em>everyone</em> quiet.</p>

<p>Assuming actual planes, families of victims don&#39;t need to be bribed...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The buildings were rigged by Israeli crews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With <em>no</em> witnesses, not even suspicous repaintings etc. (There would be a BUNCH of extra wiring, and columns would need thicker &#39;walls&#39; around them to hide the explosives.</p>

<ul>
<li>How / why Israeli?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the rest of them... who is going to provide witness protection...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, enough witnesses would not need witness protection, and a witness winding up dead / &#39;missing&#39; would just lend credence to what they were saying. You must assume that <em>no one</em> has the courage, and does not discuss what they know with <em>ANYONE</em>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As a side note, your huge anti-israel stance loses you some credibility points.</p>

<p>Yes it does. You may <em>assume</em>, but if you want to <em>know</em>, you ask an expert.</p>

<p>... actually what ever... the point of this thread is to point out the RIDICULOUS number of non-governmental participants / witnesses that must then be bribed / threatened.</p>

<p>Assuming a rigged building, everyone that saw / suspected / did anything are being very quite. (But which I mean the occupants of the floors, didn&#39;t mention any work that may identify a rigged building -- the walls around columns would be enlarged to hide the bombs, cables going EVERYWHERE. ) No one saw anything, instead it&#39;s up to theorists to guess / assume, with no other evidence.</p>

<p>The collapsing buildings can (and have) been explained by experts (bribed as well) and popular mechanics (bribed as well).</p>

<p>Which is my issue with rigged buildings.</p>

<p>WTC7 was damaged, then they evacuated, then assuming it was going to collapse anyway, Silverstein ensured his insurance would cover him if they (safely) pulled it down, instead of waiting for a &#39;natural&#39; fall - which could cost the insurer more.</p>

<p>WTC7 wasn&#39;t control-demolished using explosives to my knowledge, it was literally pulled down / Allowed to fall safely using cables (of some sort) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of compartmentalization and need-to-know information going around in different government agencies, not to mention different levels of security clearances. It really only takes a few people to know the whole plan and then a few hundred/thousand people working in different areas of various government agencies to carry it out. The idea is that, each individual only knows his part he doesn&#39;t know what the other hands are doing and therefore not many would easily figure out that they were part of a bigger plan. This is a concept used time and time again and this how the people in power get away with all kinds of things not just 9/11. Having said that, there are so many aspects to 9/11 and so much disinformation that I don&#39;t know that we will ever get an exact explanation as to what happened, but I would have to say I am leaning way more toward inside job then the movie-version we&#39;ve been spoon fed.</p>

<p>Some seople indirectly benefitted from 9-11, in terms of Iraq / Afghan wars. 9-11 didn&#39;t have to take place in the way it happened in order for those wars to still happen (esp. Iraq).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just side step this one..</p>

<p>That&#39;s my issue, depending on what you think happened, cover-up gets exponentially more difficult (see my orig. post&#39;s list).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone of anything, I&#39;m just stating what I&#39;ve found in my research to be true. If you&#39;ve researched this and you&#39;re comfortable believing the official story, fine. Many people are uncomfortable with information that opposes the world view and would rather look for information that supports their view no matter how ridiculous. I also understand that from your perspective, you could think that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;ve simply found that compartmentalization and control of information is a function of many government agencies most notably the C.I.A. and the same goes for intelligence agencies throughout the world. The fact that there are levels of Top Secret and above clearance, that even the President doesn&#39;t have the clearance to access pieces of information is a blatant example of this. To think they don&#39;t take advantage of this fact is an optimistic but somewhat naive view. Also, I don&#39;t claim I know everything that happened on 9/11 but I do firmly believe that what they told us happened is not the whole truth. There is a lot of gray area in our daily lives, what makes us think something as big as 9/11 is black &amp; white?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is similar to Johnny_Cash. The &quot;hijackers&quot; were obstensibly Saudis and the whole operation was supposedly planned in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a family-tyranny where people live in constant danger from police annd military. It&#39;s unlikely that there are many conspirators in the US. It would be far easier to make a request of the Saudi regime to carry out the attacks and then rely on them to keep it quiet.</p>

<p>In any case, if Al-qaeda was not responsible for any aspect of the 9-11 attacks, would it not make sense for them to say they weren&#39;t involved (in that particular aspect), to get the U.S. population to distrust their govt?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I put hijackers in quotes because of the many contridictions that emerge from the limited investigation so far. What we do know indicates that the event was allowed to happen. Professional pilots have come out to declare that the maneuver required to turn the planes around in a tight time frame would be impossible for a pro, much less an amateur. There are many more inconsistancies so I leave the question of legitimate hijacking open.</p>

<p>Rigging the towers would not be as difficult as we are led to believe. All that would have been required are charges at ground level and around the area of impact. We know that at least 2 explosions were heard coming from ground level, any from above are still in question. There is no need to wire the entire buildings; that is a red herring put up by those opposed to an investigation.</p>

<p>The object of terrorism is to get people to fear you. Whenever an attack of any sort takes place many groups rush to take responsibility. What I find extremely puzzling for the official story is how the suspect group was named within hours and the list of suspects released immediately afterward. </p>

<p>I also think that many of the theories that have emerged are fanciful and are reactions to stress. If a proper investigation had been carried out I think that the motivations for the attacks and the implementation would turn out to much more simple than supposed. </p>

<p>I assume you mean the pentagon flight? I&#39;ll google, I hadn&#39;t heard this, though of course a Pro couldn&#39;t do it without crashing...</p>

<p>But the towers began collapsing top down, the charges need to be at the level that the planes hit...</p>

<p>Explosives just at the bottom would also be noticed.. explosions noticed @ the bottom before the building starts falling. (Post falling implies the explosions weren&#39;t required...)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know that at least 2 explosions were heard coming from ground level, </p>

<p>Video or witnessed? And did any of the 100s(?) of service men notice the explosions (as either &#39;suspicious&#39; or &#39;to be expected&#39;).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no need to wire the entire buildings; that is a red herring put up by those opposed to an investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on how buildings are normally demolished, in order to achieve something similar to how the WT Towers collapsed (falling on themselves), rigging of a substantial quantity is required...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever an attack of any sort takes place many groups rush to take responsibility. </p>

<p>What other groups (attempted to take/) took responsibility for the attack?</p>

<p>Not sure about the details. I can &#39;make up&#39; that maybe intelligence agencies thought that maybe group X was going to do something, but didn&#39;t know what...</p>

<p>Or after the attacks were carried out, the group in question celebrated / declared... and informants near (not nec. <em>in</em>) passed the word along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it from your handle that you&#39;re in New Zealand. I&#39;m in Canada. I don&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve had the pleasure of a conversation with a Kiwi before. </p>

<p>On the day of 9/11 I was in the same state of shock as everyone else. The next day however I became a skeptic because even the few details that had emerged did not stack up. At first my focus was on the Pentagon and the crash in Pennsylvania. I&#39;ve written much on those topics already in other posts so I won&#39;t bring those up here.</p>

<p>There are just so many reasons to think that the jets that hit the towers were false flags. First is the problem of turning the planes around without crashing. Then we have the coincidence of all 4 aircraft being Boeing 757s, aircraft that were unpopular, being phased out, and cheap to obtain. Once the towers came down and everything was pulverized we are asked to believe that the wallet of a hijacker is the only item to survive intact? All of this and more make the official story preposterous.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t bookmark every page that I read so please understand that this is 3rd hand info. Pilots familiar with 757s have come out to say that even under optimal flying conditions they would have had trouble duplicating the quick turn needed to fit the time frame. At the time the aircraft left the control area and broke radar contact the planes would not have reached cruising altitude or their top speed. So a hijacker would have taken over the plane at a speed and altitude that rendered manuevers improbable. And, given that none of the hijackers were trained to fly 757, I would move that into the realm of impossible.  For another perspective:  </p>

<p><a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=18405">http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=18405</a></p>

<p>I investigated the construction of the towers and found that they had been built differently from other buildings, incorporating a new technique that reduced weight and swaying caused by the wind. It took me a while to figure out how the demolition could have been carried out. Then I found that someone had beaten me to it in this article: </p>

<p><a href="http://gordonssite.tripod.com/id2.html">http://gordonssite.tripod.com/id2.html</a></p>

<p>The last man out of tower 2, the first to fall, says that as he was getting out he heard the explosions coming from the sub-basement. I have no link for you though. Here&#39;s a good summary piece if want to wade though it:</p>

<p><a href="http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-09-09/911-attack-job.html">http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-09-09/911-attack-job.html</a></p>

<p>Groups claiming responsibility usually contact government agencies or the news media. News media get so many calls from people claiming responsibility for any number of crimes that all are turned over to the FBI. The FBI then informs the news media as to what claims are news-worthy. At times this arrangement works to public favour by trashing bogus reports early. At other times, like 9/11, it can be used to mislead. Based upon what normally happens, I find it unlikely that only one group claimed responsibility.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not one to propose motives. I only look at the facts as they are to raise my doubts as to the event itself and the reasons behind it. Too many people stray from facts into fantasy and that is where the 9/11 truth movement loses credibility. What I will say is this - nothing complicated works. That is to say, the more complicated a machine or a plan, the more there is to go wrong. On 9/11 simply too many things went right for me to think that the plan was as complex as some believe. I may be wrong on this point so I&#39;m always open to new information or ideas, so long as they stick to facts.     </p>

<p>Yeah, but I have more faith in man-kind. They can still shoot planes out of the sky and go bust a cap in the middle east. Less enthusiasm from the poplace sure, but &#39;appropriate&#39; embelishments would get it done.</p>

<p>And yes of all &#39;conspiracy theorys&#39; this one is significantly more plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... </p>

<p>but the official story is still how it happened, No rockets, no bomb-rigged buildings. Else that completely ruins your plausability.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve got to assume by reptilians you mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilians">reptilians</a> in which case you&#39;re f&#39;ing crazy.
(But your LIHOP remains plausible, just unverified and maybe unverifiable).</p>

<p>Yes it does. You may <em>assume</em>, but if you want to <em>know</em>, you ask an expert.</p>

<p>... actually what ever... the point of this thread is to point out the RIDICULOUS number of non-governmental participants / witnesses that must then be bribed / threatened.</p>

<p>Assuming a rigged building, everyone that saw / suspected / did anything are being very quite. (But which I mean the occupants of the floors, didn&#39;t mention any work that may identify a rigged building -- the walls around columns would be enlarged to hide the bombs, cables going EVERYWHERE. ) No one saw anything, instead it&#39;s up to theorists to guess / assume, with no other evidence.</p>

<p>The collapsing buildings can (and have) been explained by experts (bribed as well) and popular mechanics (bribed as well).</p>

<p>Which is my issue with rigged buildings.</p>
