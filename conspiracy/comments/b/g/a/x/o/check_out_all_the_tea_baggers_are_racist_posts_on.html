    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Tea Party&quot; is real. It&#39;s as real as the outrage when someone questioned Bush after 9/11, or the support for the invasion of Afghanistan. </p>

<p>It&#39;s real because it was co-opted from a marginal existing movement by one entity, FOX.</p>

<p>FOX is the ultimate psyops tool. They have Western civilization covered.</p>

<p>Did anyone notice that during the lead up to the 2008 election, FOX essentially repositioned itself as a quasi-libertarian, pro free markets, pro capitalist network? A network that questioned the government, stood up for civil rights... after a decade of absolute commitment to the Bush administration?</p>

<p>The Tea Party came out of the Ron Paul movement (that FOX boycotted by not including Paul in the presidential debates) and was reimagined by FOX, primarily by Glenn Beck.</p>

<p>The technique I think that was used to accomplish this dilution of any real resistance or third-party was the gradual picking apart of FOX News credibility in the mainstream over the past 10 years - pundits like Bill O&#39;Reilly and Hannity have undeniably become jokes to people who don&#39;t watch FOX. </p>

<p>The loss of public confidence in FOX was inevitable due to it&#39;s unfailing support of Bush policies like torture and the preemptive war.</p>

<p>The credibility of the network was so tarnished that MSNBC suddenly became &#39;the voice of reason&#39;... right about the time Obama is elected. </p>

<p>Then all FOX had to do was sponsor and manipulate the first signs of any legitimate uprising and watch the remaining morons who stuck with FOX come out to play. Instant marginalization of any real grassroots movement.</p>

<p>MSNBC had a free ride ridiculing the Tea Party simply because it was affiliated with FOX. They could completely ignore the real libertarian movement which is much more concerned with ending or at the very least auditing the Fed.</p>

<p>So really, It&#39;s a combination of the two (MSNBC/FOX). Why use just one propaganda network when you can have two and people think they actually have a choice?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>some</em>.  It&#39;s one thing to point out that a few idiots on camera, or in real life, are doing this stuff.  That&#39;s going to happen, inevitably.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s another to accuse <em>millions</em> of people of being racists on the basis of the actions of a few.  </p>

<p>The burden of proof is on those making such accusations.  And without that proof, dragging this issue to the degree that it is lately amounts to nothing more than rabble-rousing, to distract from the <em>real</em> issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is a meeting place for racists that project their own racism onto others.  It&#39;s really sad.  If the only possible reason they can see for not liking this administration is the fact that Obama is black, then the racism shoe is clearly on the other foot.  Kinda ironic in a way.  They just don&#39;t understand how they can be racist considering that they support Obama who they say is black (I state &quot;they say&quot; because they are again the ones bringing up race.  They are always the ones bringing up race.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. Racism is seeing one&#39;s race as superior to others. People are always confusing classism and ethnocentrism with actual racism.

    <div class="md"><p>No!  Any false accusation based solely on race or the accuser&#39;s perception of how others see race is itself racism.  You can&#39;t box in racism.  Racism can be demonstrated in many ways.</p>

<p>Liberals often believe they know better than others.  They often believe they know why others act a certain way.  This is usually called elitism (or an asshole).  So they don&#39;t just think they&#39;re superior to a specific race.  They think they&#39;re superior to just about anyone that doesn&#39;t think like they do.  So now they add false accusations of racism to their repertoire of self-superiority and it ironically turns THEM into racists.</p>

<p>But anyway, it&#39;s not so much that I think these guys are plants (they may or may not be- it&#39;s certainly not unprecedented), but rather the degree to which this is being blown way out of proportion, to the effect of essentially smearing those who object to anything this government does, is rather suspect.</p>

<p>All this proves is that a few vocal idiots can find themselves on national television cameras from time to time- and that this makes for good TV for those who are drooling for anything that plays in favor of their own &quot;team&quot;.</p>
