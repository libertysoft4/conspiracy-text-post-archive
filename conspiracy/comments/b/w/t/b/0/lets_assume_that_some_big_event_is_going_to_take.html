        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are so many things that could go wrong, but there are still only so many things that could go wrong. I think it could be one of the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disaster:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>alien attack;<br/></li>
<li>staged alien attack (to bring us all together?);</li>
<li>natural disasters;<br/></li>
<li>man made natural disasters (have you ever read &#39;state of fear?&#39;);</li>
<li>cosmic events (comets, stray planets, drastic changes in cosmic energies; &amp; their gravitational and electrical    properties affecting us, or interacting with us directly [hitting us]);<br/></li>
<li>engineered war, because wars don&#39;t happen by accident anymore;<br/></li>
<li>social/political/financial failure, most likely engineered by some group;<br/></li>
<li><p>police state, as a probable consequence of any of the above;   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consciousness changes:</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>we all realize we need to love and share with everyone and work together;   </p></li>
<li><p>we become ingrained in technology i.e. cyborgs (like invader zim, the borg, or just augmented reality or communication implants);  </p></li>
<li><p>someone is born who can/ some people become able to: communicate with computers mentally (like actually interact or begin to process and decipher all the EMR around us, like someone who could get wi-fi with their brain), communicate with other people with their minds (what&#39;s that planet of the apes squeal?), or telekinesis; </p></li>
<li><p>meditation becomes the new fad and everyone realizes they can fly and bend spoons and we begin interacting with alien in distant galaxies (as in &#39;fantastic planet&#39;)  </p></li>
<li><p>we sublimate into pure energy and skip the killing our species stage from &#39;forbidden planet   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know many of these are outlandish possibilities, but if we want to survive &quot;chance favors the prepared.&quot; What do you think will happen, how and/or why, and what can we do to prepare for it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NASA has already warned of a super solar storm in 2012....which would take out our already deteriorating electrical grid. With power out around the globe I&#39;m sure people would start going crazy.
Although I have belief in the Mayan calander and it&#39;s accuracy, I do not believe in the western interpretation of it being the end of the world. Our belief in end times was corrupted centuries ago when the bible was misinterpreted and rewritten by pagans....actual statements in the bible speak of the end of the aeon/ages, not the end of the world.
I believe if something does happen in 2012, it will be a second chance for mankind, and that an opening of our consciousness will occur.
Who knows if/what will happen in 2012, and that to sit in fear is exactly what is expected and wanted by the elite of the globe. 
Remember, &quot;there is nothing to fear, but fear itself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am never quite sure what to think about 2012 it seems unlikely simply that if something were to happen why would the whole world get some advance warning? It reminds me of the &quot;Jesus will return any day now&quot; people and obviously there was no way to truly make that prediction. But perhaps this is different because the Mayans were just so precise with their calendars (maybe <em>the</em> best in history.) In general one can respect their theory as it correlates with large chunks of time, precession of the equinoxes etc - if anything a big question is whether or not one can accept Mayan cosmology - that time is &#39;speeding up,&#39; heading for a collision with the future. There are issues as to whether one can accept the interpretation that some physical event will happen, there do seem to be some debates on that. That said I don&#39;t tend to buy into the idea that the Mayans randomly ended their calendar here - I do think there is some significance to that date. I have big questions about a &#39;dooms day clock&#39; hype (let&#39;s not forget Y2K). I just think that if 2012 does mark a consciousness shift why would have to be overt? If there was a consciousness shift it may not be that everyone instantly sees &#39;the truth&#39; in the blink of an eye - it may just mark the beginning of a time when individually people begin to wake up. If you look at Eastern philosophy at all, supposedly we all have the capacity to wake up and some of us do but it can&#39;t just be explained to someone else - just imagine trying to explain the internet to a cave man etc perhaps it would be something like that. I also tend to think that we can expect to know soon what the story with the alien/UFO issue really is. Obviously there has been a cover-up - this issue has been forbidden for no good reason for so long now and you can&#39;t get a straight answer etc. I can&#39;t help but feel that the bubble is due to burst in the near future and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it there was some connection with the 2012 issue. </p>
