    <div class="md"><p>Toyota has not been fully transparent on this issue, which makes me think that in fact they are at fault.</p>

<p>It is possible that the acceleration issue was given more publicity to resuscitate the US auto industry, but Toyota is still at fault.</p>

<p>Corporations, especially car companies, have a history of avoiding safety issues for political reasons.  There&#39;s a book documenting these issues in an earlier era called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed">unsafe at any speed</a>.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the auto industry has improved since that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the entire toyota thing is bullshit... I&#39;m convinced there was a problem in like 2 cars .. MAYBE! .. and that it can be quickly fixed by putting the car in neutral, pressing down the brake , turning the car off, and applying the e-brake. 
Most of the &quot;incidents&quot; were most likely stupid old people getting there floor mats stuck under the pedals and not knowing what to do.. then blaming COMPUTERS! because thats what old people do. </p>

<p>even the guy this past week who was all over the news ... had all this time to call 911 and shit.. but refused to put his car in neutral because he didn&#39;t want to &quot; flip&quot; his car... then he stopped the &quot;run away toyota&quot; buy applying the brakes.... then turning off the car... and stopping... THIS IS NEWS?!?!?! .. O yeah then it came out that he was deep in debt and couldn&#39;t afford his prius and would most likely do anything to get out of paying for it.. and or sue toyota... </p>

<p>The point is.. there is no problem. The incidents are a mixture of stupid old people.. floor mats... and people wanting to make some quick cash off something the government is convinced happens even though it cant be re-produced.</p>

<p>I heard a talk show on the radio talking about computer in cars and how dangerous it must be since computer at home &quot;Crash&quot; all the time and you have to use &quot;ctrl-alt-delete&quot; but you cant do that with a car...... BUT your car isnt running windows to control the ACCELERATION! .. It&#39;s called a fucking EMBEDDED SYSTEM.. how often does the embedded operating system in your oven at home crash?!.. </p>

<p>anyways.. just my 2 cents as a 4th year computer engineering student who&#39;s dad is mechanic for toyota of god knows how many years..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as the cars were designed by Japanese engineers in Japan, presumably under Japanese regulations, I&#39;m not sure that you&#39;re correct that it was a matter of lax US regulations.</p>

<p>That idea would also ignore the obvious profit motive: they didn&#39;t want to damage their reputation or suffer the financial burden of a recall.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s most likely that it was just a &quot;shit happens&quot; scenario where it was more or less just one of those unavoidable design flaws - at first.  But since then, and again this is just a guess, I bet that the government has secretly encouraged these stories to be spread far and wide and <em>may even</em> have faked a few more non-injury causing incidents to keep the story alive.</p>

<p>And yeah, it would make just as much sense or more sense for the car companies themselves to have been the ones paying to have the story widely reported and hyped up, so maybe that&#39;s what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ford actually does pretty well in the euro market. the thing is we get the garbage like the taurus and europe gets cars like the fiesta. also, the european focus and escort are waaaaay different than what we got by those names. the #1 selling brand of cars in china is Buick. i shit you not, i know i was shocked as well.</p>

<p>american cars are wonderfuly cheap, but probably not  by the time they get hit by european import tarriffs.
Americans see a an qaoffordable New CAr asa basic right almost like part of unofficial constitution/bill of rights, since the 1950s. this makes it hard for domestic auto makers.
alot of the time though the only reason they get bought in the uk is because they receive weird government grants. 
E.G. the government in UK subsidises modified cars for the disabled [with suitable finance terms lol, and you get to choose between GM and GM]</p>

<p>the  same import tarrifs with European cars going to USA. alot of press in Time magazine about steel and auto protectionism.
 which is why  Benz, Range Rover,  BMW and luxury sports marques doing okay but not fiats, and Renaults. Volvo have tried hard [marketing wise]and played well with the federal safety laws and disclosures of tests. but they are very affordable luxury cars with lots of options.</p>

<p>You&#39;re neglecting SAAB buddy, another swedish carmaker known for affordability, quality of build, great handling and acceleration and innovations in safety systems, look it up... until GM aquired them and put them on the Opel Vectra platform, which generally cheapened the brand.

<p>Sure, they can make some fine cars, but at a price point that prevents them from being mass market in the way that Japanese cars are.  He seemed to imply (or maybe I just read too much into it) that European cars were superior themselves to the US rather than touting Japanese supremacy in both markets.</p>

<p>The key is that they engineer their 4 and 6 cylinder engines to be easy to work on and replace parts. (their modern tundra v6 has ample space in the engine compartment).</p>
