<p>I&#39;m not saying a hunk of granite/basalt will be <em>coherent</em> at all, but it will experience nonuniform stress in a changing EM field. If it&#39;s got any mica, quartz, etc at all you can take it for granite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just reading about haarp on wikipedia and I once saw part of that Jesse Ventura show about it.  So, I really don&#39;t know much about it.</p>

<p>Questions-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Has anyone come up with a viable theory as to how haarp could actually cause earthquakes?  It seems unlikely, at best, that a series of antennas in Alaska could cause tectonic plates to shift in other parts of the world.  </p></li>
<li><p>It seems that haarp has been blamed for the earthquakes in china and haiti, and now probably chile.  Can anyone say why those particular locations would be chose?.  It&#39;s not like the Chinese earthquake destroyed Shanghai or the manufacturing capabilities of China.  I could see Haiti being thought of as a viable test site because it has no real strategic value (if you were really evil).</p></li>
<li><p>How does one explain the fact that equally or more devastating earthquakes have been occurring since time immemorial?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT- Question #3 was stupid.  I guess what I mean is - what proof can be offered that the earthquakes were caused by haarp AND what proof would need to be shown to definitively prove that it was haarp?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can connect HAARP to earth quakes with the fact that some larger earthquakes do emit a burst of ELF/ULF waves shortly before erupting, <a href="http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/3833">http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/3833</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that a device like HAARP could be used to also trigger earth quakes through some sort of sympathetic resonance. It definitely is not a sure thing that HAARP causes earth quakes, but it is without a doubt that HAARP is capable of vibrating the earth with a crap load of power. </p>

<p>The electrojet can be used as an <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/16945">antenna</a></p>

<p>EM fields can change the shape of certain <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/18201/piezoelectric-effect.html">piezoelectric materials</a></p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s crust is mostly <a href="http://mistupid.com/geology/earthcrust.htm">Si and O</a>.</p>

<p>SiO2 = Quartz a well know piezoelectric substance that makes up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_%28geology%29">45-60%</a> of the Earth&#39;s Crust depending if it is oceanic or continental crust.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: HAARP can possibly be used to trigger earthquakes by manipulating the energy that is already present in the ionosphere/electrojet in a specific way, ELF resonance perhaps, therefore affecting the piezoelectric crust in such a way that triggers a shift of the already energetic crust/mantle of the Earth.</p>

<p>I tend to think HAARP itself doesn&#39;t have enough energy to directly cause shifts, but as the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ34nQxrWo">Mythbusters</a> have demonstrated, a tiny bit resonance can go a long way.</p>

Will glass do rather than granite? 
 ok go into your garage and fire up your 500 watt bass guitar rig. Now try to rest your drink glass on the amp while playing.
I&#39;m sure you&#39;d get the same reaction out of granite or bassalt even at this power level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one can hear 10 cycle notes or less.
The average person cannot hear anything below 20 cycles.no matter how loud, though they might feel the vibration.
 Although the high frequency component of the HAARP signal is indeed projected through the air as radio waves, the ELF sound is transmitted through the earth as pressure waves   therefore your assertion of electromagnetism being the active form of energy is false my analogy of the bass amp stands.</p>

<p>Vibrations in the acoustic range of 10 hz or less ( which HAARP admits to using to &quot; communicate with submarines&quot;)  would be heard by no one. Vibration in the range of the resonance frequency of rock or the earth would certainly affect those rocks. If they were precariously positioned they could more easily be affected by vibration at that resonance frequency.
.HAARP is in the process of looking for those weak points and cavities underground  as pointed out in the link i left. If the earth was geologically agitated by subharmonic patterns being varied against that resonance frequency  they could cause that which is near happening to happen, such as an earthquake.</p>

<p>Two other notes. 
 I don&#39;t , so far , believe there was anything man made about the Chile earthquake but I&#39;m awaiting any information to the contrary. I&#39;m expecting a link from someone who believes that it was man made though, as opposed to Haiti where the evidence, such as it is , is in. and finally, I don&#39;t have to prove my OPINION as stated here to anyone. You in particular would reject anything , no matter how powerfully convincing that might be said or shown. So in my OPINION you should fuck off.</p>

<p>There is no resonance frequency for a homogeneous strata.  You&#39;d need a uniform homogeneous strata to have a resonance frequency (i.e. an entire tectonic shelf made of 100% uniform steel or bassaltic glass).  That just doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The resonance frequency of the entire earth is called the Shumann resonance. It is equal to 7.8 cycles. and is actually the resonance of the volume of atmosphere. No one can hear that low a frequency.</p>

<p>The ELF can be sent out harmlessly through the earth and then  caused to concentrate it&#39;s power in a weak area of the crust or mantel  by the disturbance of the wave pattern at the target location by using the radio high frequency component. I don&#39;t have evidence of this except for having seen the concept as a graphic presentation, and by  having seen the graphic of HAARP&#39;s output  dramatically increased at the proper time to have this effect in Haiti.</p>

<p>Here is a visible result of what I believe is the high frequency component of HAARP&#39;s signal being bounced back down to earth in a concentrated form and perhaps to such a target location.
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=hole%20punch%20cloud&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=hole%20punch%20cloud&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi</a></p>

<p>You may well observe that these cloud formations seem to result from an area being punched downward from above ( perhaps bounced off of the ionosphere) causing the center of what was once a cloud, that is now a hole in the cloud to freeze below it&#39;s former location due to much colder temperatures being punched downward from above by a beam of energy.</p>

<p>Such an outcome  as was seen in Haiti has been demonstrated to have desirable political benefits. </p>

<p>Variations and combination of  harmonics of frequencies  near the  Schumann resonance also attenuate the mood of human beings which is also politically useful.</p>

The common claims here are that some atmospheric source (HAARP) of <em>Radiation</em> (electro-magnetic, not sonic) transmits its energy from the open atmosphere into slabs of granite and bassalt that are 30-70 miles thick at least, and thousands of miles wide, and somehow impart enough energy to cause that slab to overcome the friction that traps it in place from surrounding plates.  It&#39;s the equivalent of saying that you could focus a radio beam from your WiFi router and make a single brick pop itself out of the middle of a brick wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You demanded I show that HAARP can project force. I did.  Most observers can see this NEW phenomenon and realize that it can only be from HAARP. These clouds did not exist a few decades ago. Cite one that did please. </p>

<p>An airplane doesn&#39;t make a hole in a cloud as it passes through.  Whatever does has to be more powerful at moving air in a basically circular form  although sometimes at an ellipse.
The  high frequency  component  that creates that hole  would be used to create a local disruption or excitation in the ELF, land based wave and thus cause it to concentrate in a given target area. The concentrated ELF wave would be capable of loosening that which is already somewhat loose. That is why HAARP searches for such underground  weaknesses.

At least it came from a knowledgeable book about Tesla&#39;s life that was published shortly after his death. I read it back in the early 80&#39;s. The energy behind a 2 cycle wave doesn&#39;t even appear at short distances and develops as it travels outward. The length of the wave is so long that it doesn&#39;t even complete one cycle until it reaches more than the distance encompassed by the average building. I would bet on the story being true.  the area of the shaking of buildings was said to be more than a mile and some say up to 4 miles surrounding Tesla&#39;s location.</p>
