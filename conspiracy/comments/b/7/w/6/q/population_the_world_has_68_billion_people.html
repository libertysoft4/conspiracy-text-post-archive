<p>Here I think you are wrong, because they also have enough money to build cities under airports, missile silo condominiums sealed from the rest of the world, build giant seed vaults, book vaults, ect. for the coming apparently non-existent make-believe engineered apocalypse.</p>

<p>They may also have the &quot;secret/forbidden&quot; knowledge about certain things that gives them an edge on manipulating consciousness.</p>

<p>Note: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a> doesn&#39;t necessarily mean Armageddon. &quot;A disclosure of something hidden from the majority of mankind in an era dominated by falsehood and misconception.&quot; </p>

<p>They are a joke in the sense that they are like court jesters, actors on the world stage, a physical manifestation of the collectively suppressed inner troll, gluttonously dwelling within the fractured psychology of the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm he&#39;s a member of the Club of Rome.
The whole main agenda of the CoR is depopulation of 80-90% of the population.</p>

<p>&quot;The Earth has cancer
and the cancer is Man.&quot;</p>

<h2>- Club of Rome, Mankind at the Turning Point, 1974</h2>

<p>&quot;… the resultant ideal sustainable population is hence more than
500 million but less than one billion.”</p>

<h2>- Club of Rome, Goals for Mankind, 1976.</h2>

<p>&quot;A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells;
the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people….
We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms
 to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many
 apparently brutal and heartless decisions.&quot;</p>

<h2>- Paul Ehrlich in The Population Bomb. Paul Ehrlich is a member of the Club of Rome.</h2>

<p>&quot;I believe that human overpopulation is the fundamental problem on Earth Today”</p>

<p>“We humans have become a disease, the Humanpox.”</p>

<h2>- Dave Foreman, Co-founder of Earth First! and member of the Club of Rome.</h2>

<p>“World population needs to be decreased by 50%”</p>

<h2>- Henry Kissinger, Former National Security Advisor, Former Secretary of State, chairman of Kissinger Associates, member of the Club of Rome.</h2>

<p>“We must speak more clearly about sexuality, contraception, about abortion,
about values that control population, because the ecological crisis, in short,
is the population crisis. Cut the population by 90% and there aren’t enough
people left to do a great deal of ecological damage.”</p>

<h2>- Mikhail Gorbachev, Former President of the Soviet Union, member of the Club of Rome.</h2>

<p>“A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.”</p>

<h2>- Ted Turner, founder of CNN and major UN donor, member of the Club of Rome.</h2>

<p>&quot;In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it is just as bad not to say it.&quot;</p>

<h2>- Jacques Cousteau, French naval officer and explorer. Member of the Club of Rome.</h2>

<p>&quot;If I were reincarnated I would wish to be returned to earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.”</p>

<h2>- Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, member of the Club of Rome.</h2>

<p><strong>Other Club of Rome members include Tony Blair, George Soros, David Rockefeller, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Javier Solana, Kofi Annan, The Dalai Lama, Robert Muller, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Gro Harlem Brundtland, King Juan Carlos of Spain and his wife Queen Sophia, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Prince Philippe of Belgium, Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan</strong> and many more people that include wealthy elites, new agers, former or current world political figures and former or current U.N. figures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there are plans in place to depopulate the world, but this doesn&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; that vaccines are a way to depopulate anything. </p>

<p>Bill said that EDUCATION and CONTRACEPTION will make our population grow more slowly. That is still more people. Not DEPOPULATION (which is less people, obviously). He did <em>not</em> say &quot;vaccines&quot; will reduce population in any way shape or form. To assert this means you either can&#39;t understand English or you are looking for something that is not there.</p>

<p>I know the cause you are championing, and I know that Bill is probably some part of it, but this speech is not any kind of smoking gun that is going to convince anyone of the validity of your argument.</p>

<p>By waving this quote around, thinking people will just assume you are a crazy person because the quote doesn&#39;t say what you think it says. You are actually <em>hurting</em> your credibility.</p>

I realize I should have phrased my comment better, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that he&#39;s saying vaccines and health care (2 things that are commonly thought to be good for us) are going to limit the growth of the population.

<p>You said Bill Gate&#39;s statements show that &quot;the elite really do think vaccines are a way to depopulate the world&quot;. </p>

<p>I said it was a ridiculous statement, given that &quot;depopulate&quot; means &quot;less people than before&quot; while Bill was talking about more people, not less. Further, you apparently totally missed the fact that he was not talking about vaccines when he made the statement. He was talking about education and contraception. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you even for real? Are condoms &quot;good for us&quot;? They reduce potential population.</p>

<p>You said Bill Gate&#39;s statements show that &quot;the elite really do think vaccines are a way to depopulate the world&quot;. </p>

<p>I said it was a ridiculous statement, given that &quot;depopulate&quot; means &quot;less people than before&quot; while Bill was talking about more people, not less. Further, you apparently totally missed the fact that he was not talking about vaccines when he made the statement. He was talking about education and contraception. </p>

<p>done here. Pay attention to what you see and hear before you go off half cocked. Better to keep your mouth closed and appear a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.</p>
