<p>The point is you&#39;re doing the same old, &quot;rabble rabble, Obama is Bush&quot; nonsense that only has merit if you&#39;re talking about some of Obama&#39;s defense and intelligence policies.</p>

<p>Sorry but you&#39;re wrong.  Let me show you.  This will be rather epic, and probably a wasted effort.  But I&#39;ll try.</p>

<h2><strong>Disregard of the Rule of Law</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Obama threatens to veto greater intelligence oversight</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marcy Wheeler notes what is probably the worst part of all of this, something I consider truly despicable:  the administration is also threatening to veto the bill because it contains funding for a new investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks, on the ground that such an investigation -- in the administration&#39;s words -- &quot;would undermine public confidence&quot; in the FBI probe of the attacks &quot;and unfairly cast doubt on its conclusions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NSA Illegal Warrantless Wiretapping Program</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...the high-level political officials who committed crimes while running the NSA will be completely immunized for their serious crimes.</p>

<p>By stark contrast, an NSA official who brought to the public&#39;s attention towering failures and waste at the NSA -- revelations that led to exposés that, as Shane put it, were &quot;honored with a top prize from the Society for Professional Journalists&quot; -- is now being prosecuted for crimes that could lead to a lengthy prison term. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>New and worse secrecy and immunity claims from the Obama DOJ</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, beyond even the outrageously broad &quot;state secrets&quot; privilege invented by the Bush administration and now embraced fully by the Obama administration, the Obama DOJ has now invented a brand new claim of government immunity, one which literally asserts that the U.S. Government is free to intercept all of your communications (calls, emails and the like) and -- even if what they&#39;re doing is blatantly illegal and they know it&#39;s illegal -- you are barred from suing them unless they &quot;willfully disclose&quot; to the public what they have learned.</p>

<p><strong>Is Obama embracing the lawless, omnipotent executive?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Obama, only the President has the power to decide what is done with classified information, and neither courts nor Congress have any power at all to do anything but politely request that the President change his mind.  Therefore, the President has the unilateral, unchallengeable power to prevent any judicial challenges to his actions by simply declaring that the relevant evidence is a secret and refusing to turn it over to a court, even if ordered to do so.  That&#39;s the argument which the Obama DOJ is now aggressively advancing -- all in order to block any judicial adjudication of Bush&#39;s now-dormant NSA program.</p>

<h2><strong>Disregard of Human Rights</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Obama&#39;s worsening civil liberties record</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, to recap:  we have indefinite detention, military commissions, Blackwater assassination squads, escalation in Afghanistan, extreme secrecy to shield executive lawbreaking from judicial review, renditions, and denials of habeas corpus.  These are not policies Obama has failed yet to uproot; <strong>they are policies he has explicitly advocated and affirmatively embraced as his own.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bagram: The sham of closing Guantanamo</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the Obama DOJ -- as expected -- filed a legal brief (.pdf) which adopted the arguments originally made by the Bush DOJ to insist that detainees whom they abduct from around the world and then ship to Bagram (rather than Guantanamo) lack any constitutional rights whatsoever, including habeas review. </p>

<p><strong>Obama authorizes assassination of U.S. citizen</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the president has the inherent authority to eavesdrop on American citizens without a warrant, imprison American citizens on his own declaration, kidnap and torture, then what can&#39;t he do?</p>

<h2>Obama&#39;s Department of Pre-Crime</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Far more significant, &quot;preventive detention&quot; allows indefinite  imprisonment not based on proven  crimes or past violations of law, but of those deemed generally &quot;dangerous&quot; by the Government for various reasons (such as, as Obama put it yesterday, they &quot;expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden&quot; or &quot;otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans&quot;).  That&#39;s what &quot;preventive&quot; means:  imprisoning people because the Government claims they are likely to engage in violent acts in the future because they are alleged to be &quot;combatants.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Obama admin hyping terrorist nuclear risk</strong></p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the best run downs on Obama I&#39;ve seen.  I would also add to this massive list Obama&#39;s reassignment of Ben Bernanke to the Federal Reserve after he over watched the collapse of 08.  </p>

<p>The one thing we always have to be cautious about is our tendency to use the noun &quot;Obama&quot; too frequently.  Most of us know he&#39;s a puppet PR guy, so sometimes it&#39;s good to imply that he is simply doing what he&#39;s told to do when it comes to his policies.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s approval rating index is -12 right now.  </p>

<p>I expect this to continue to decline, since The Obama Administration received a slight bump recently because of the passing of the health care bill.  One of the primary goals of the Obama Administration is to postpone the financial collapse to his second term, and hope the continuous decline is pushed back so the Obama Administration can be reelected. </p>

<p>Great work.</p>

<p>Very true.  It&#39;s a difficult balancing act because while we don&#39;t want to scape-goat the puppet and hence help misdirect ourselves into focusing on the wrong problems, at the same time we have to keep in mind that many people really are already focusing their love on the puppet.  I think that has to be broken through first before you slip in the whole &quot;two heads of one party&quot; idea and going further down the rabbit hole with notions of TPTB and whatnot.  Otherwise, you&#39;ll be dismissed as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, unfortunately.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting to me is how rampant this attitude was during the Bush years. Bush was and is the great political sin-eater. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, Dem lapdogs are rehashing all the same whiny, blind faith defenses for their fearless leader that Bush followers used -- particularly when you point out any of Obama&#39;s similarities to his predecessor. &quot;Give him time, he knows what he&#39;s doing,&quot; &quot;Stop &#39;bashing,&#39;&quot; etc. I had one even tell me that if I didn&#39;t like Obama, I should leave the country. Love it or leave it, baby!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, it&#39;s great you want to account for Obama&#39;s sinister underbelly; I&#39;m all for speaking out against the blindness of our public, or of our Reddit.</p>

<p>There are some problems with your post.  One is tooting your own horn &quot;This will be rather epic&quot; -- don&#39;t turn people off to your ideas before you even get a chance to lay it out.  &quot;and probably a wasted effort&quot; -- omg, do you really need a safety net to say what you&#39;re going to say?  Do you really need to establish that you&#39;re better than everyone else before spending a couple hours putting links together?</p>

<p>Another is absolute equivalence.  No matter how many things you find similar about the two administrations, Bush was Bush-league in the incompetence game.  There are differences, and even if Bush and Obama administrations are right next to each other in the bigger political spectrum, those small differences can&#39;t be taken lightly if you want people to listen to you.</p>

<p>You need to say, &quot;Sure Bush made XYZ mistakes, but Obama is making VYZ mistakes&quot; -- you need to highlight the smallness of the differences, then, if you want to make a point about how similar they are.  Acknowledge the difference and then show the overlap.  The overlap isn&#39;t total, so stop using such a wide brush!</p>

<p>And, I&#39;m sorry, but the small differences at this scale make for huge differences in consequences.  How much more impacting it would be if there were more substantial differences, but to call them the same is to look from a prioritized perspective, not an objective one.  You compare using sweeping categorical statements.  And certainly those categories are damning to the Obama administration from a peace &amp; justice perspective.  All I&#39;m imploring you to do is bridge the gap.  &quot;Sure the Bush policy was a little bit worse in this way, but Obama&#39;s policy is so much worse in this other way…&quot;</p>

<p>So, sure, go ahead and make your point, but you could make it so much better!  All you&#39;ve done is list a bunch of stuff.  Hopefully the blind among us will read your list and reconsider their allegiances.   Meanwhile, this isn&#39;t a post that truly compares the two;  this is a post that attacks the one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s enough overlap for me.  Subjective?  Sure.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a full time computer programmer who typically works 60-80 hour weeks. Not a journalist. It sounds like you&#39;re asking me to do Glenn Greenwald type of work.  I&#39;ll gladly point to it, which is what I have done.</p>

<p>Yes- and people can do the intellectual legwork for themselves and dig further.  I&#39;m just pointing out what I&#39;ve found.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I see what you&#39;re saying, but there is an implicit assumption in the post that those who&#39;d care are already quite familiar with the abuses of the Bush administration.  Again, I can only do so much on my own, in a Reddit post that&#39;s already very very lengthy.</p>
