    <div class="md"><p>A. People Wake Up</p>

<p>I suppose there are many things &#39;the people&#39; could wake up from.  The most important of which I would argue involves the current <em>ident</em>ity crises.  If &#39;the people&#39; were aware of the choice, &#39;even if they were only aware of it at a near-unconscious level&#39;, while contracting in trade/commerce with &#39;the people&#39; that they are not lawfully required to seek limited liability status through legal fictions like the 14th Amendment US Citizenship.  That they may as living men and women, as citizens of their respective States and through the national citizenship derived therefrom , through their own volition and under <em>full liability</em>, contract and carry on trade unmolested from a 3rd party interested intervener, i.e. the municipal corporations posing as the de jure governments.  Furthermore, if &#39;the people&#39; were to awake to discover the true liberty, freedom, and responsibility inherent in operating under full liability under the original jurisdiction and embrace such a status, the exchange would be almost immediate and mean nothing short of the dissolution of public contracts in favor of private and positive contracting law.  This would render the majority of legislative acts, legal statutes, municipal ordinances, and various codes beyond enforcement as they are mostly rules only applicable to legal fictions of which &#39;the people&#39; are no longer identifying their status as.</p>

<p>No more would be the fictitious jurisdiction attorneys operate under and properly seated judges would have to actually have a <em>body of crime</em> to hear a case.  Simply put, no more victim-less crimes prosecution, which represents the absolute majority of cases today where you have the peculiarity of the Judge representing the STATE OF UTAH while simultaneously the &#39;victim&#39; is the STATE OF UTAH.  Hell, we might actually have &#39;the people&#39; receiving fair trials, with actual evidence of harm and loss being presented.</p>

<p>Further, the implications of &#39;the people&#39; operating in honor under the original jurisdiction of the National Constitution would have sweeping effects on political elections(especially involving senators), legal tender laws, private banking, commercial transactions and instruments, and what could best be described as a return of control over the accumulated assets of this Nation as accounted for in each municipal corporations CAFR.</p>

<p>We would not have to borrow money into existence from foreign banks at interest, but could borrow from our own bank the Treasury of the United States. </p>

<p>B.
tl;dr</p>

<p>End the most recent bankruptcy proceedings of the corporate US circa 1929, setoff the national debt in its entirety to the original creditors and return the collateralized assets being held by the IMF and FED to &#39;the people&#39; of the United States via the secretary of the treasury.</p>

<p>C. Things would be way different.  Are we ready to operate in commerce under full liability, where your word is your bond, where if you promise to pay a man in performance of a contract and you don&#39;t, a court of record can make you pay, no discharging?  Or is their system of limited liability, statutory law, and prepaid debt accounting something you can dig? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>spockturd made some interesting points... first of all, in order to awaken the masses, a whole lot of people who&#39;ve never seen &quot;the horror&quot; would have to experience it first or second hand.... </p>

<p>Picture storm trooper police men bashing in the idealistic minds of rebellious young adults....</p>

<p>B?</p>

<p>Mass protests, maybe even some rioting, i see no alternative... And this would almost have to be worldwide, not just the USA... one idea would be to blockade all trade routes, along the borders and the coast lines, with a focus on oil (and maybe coffee?)...</p>

<p>Stop business for a day, a week, if it could be done for a month or more i bet the whole system would collapse... For this you&#39;d need millions of people, most of whom would be willing to give their lives for &quot;the cause&quot;.</p>

<p>At the same time, we&#39;d need millions to flood government buildings and corporations with the express purpose of stopping them from doing business, all while doing something extraordinary like shooting gov. officials and CEOs with divine love energy... in other words it will take a miracle...</p>

<p>The three things we are told are impolite to talk about in America: politics, religion, money.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a cache of weapons. You need a neighborhood and neighbors who are comfortable around firearms and know why it is important to fight for their use even if they choose not to own one.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need tons of money. You need to not be nickled and dimed to death by big banks and you need to share that information. What is a bailout? It&#39;s nickel and diming the tax payers to keep crooked bankers afloat and keep our political ties happy and content.  </p>

<p>I could go on. Pick a subject and start talking about it with people you don&#39;t know. If they get all defensive they are not ready to open their eyes. They may never be.</p>

<p>Form groups of people who feel the same way and discuss what can be done.</p>

<p>Yes exactly. Please discuss</p>

<p>Ahh I see you&#39;ve added some things.</p>

<p>The things you&#39;ve added seem to be about getting people to wake up. </p>

<p>What I am saying is.. okay everybody is now awake and realizes how they have been fucked over. What could possibly be done to change it when those in charge have unlimited power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to change their mindsets so that tomorrow they make more informed decisions. So it starts now.</p>

<p>Learning how to be self sufficient is a good start and ironically self sufficiency starts with knowing other people who are wanting or doing the same. You can cover each others weaknesses with each others strengths.</p>

<p>We rely on the military, welfare, the medical field etc for all our woes. Start getting healthy. Allocate where your money <em>doesn&#39;t</em> go - charities for Cancer, disaster relief, higher education in some instances, credit cards and bank fees, lessen your taxes because it doesn&#39;t go to the deficit it goes to the military.</p>

<p>Invest money wisely - reject the current money system, give money to political campaigns, invest in your own personal survival education etc., get into office or support friend who do. </p>

<p>Stop being a consumer. That money supports their agenda not yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends on your definition of &quot;Waking up.&quot; Proper education to prove to yourself a political point of view takes years or decades, things would change slowly. </p>

<p>Perhaps your more of a spiritual person ? Even still, Enlightenment would take as long if not longer. </p>

<p>IF - and this is the biggest of ifs -  People started to really educate themselves, especially the education <em>of</em> the self - Became active in society, became philosophers, every man a politician, every man participates to the fullest or least of his will-  Every waking day would be to us - a lucid dream, and every night a sound sleep, and every death rejoiced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Lets say everybody realized the government was not looking out for the peoples best interests but those of the super wealthy. That 911 was an inside job.</p>

<p>Those 2 things right there.. I mean what could people really do to change anything being those in charge are ultimately all powerful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They stand up, all of us.  We stand up and cross our arms....stand out front a big Gov&#39;t building and say &quot;no more&quot;.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t move and in our way protest while the country and the world STOPS.</p>

<p>We make the shit stop dead.  We stop dead to show OUR power.  OUR control.  Without US, NOTHING happens.  Shit doesn&#39;t go down until someone says OK, let&#39;s work this out.....or worst case scenario, bullets start flying.</p>

<p>Now, if we did that.....they would shoot first.  They would do that to make us react and falter.  They would want to break us.</p>

<p>If we all of a sudden realized the severity of the issue, we COULD NOT break.  We couldn&#39;t fail.  (Plus we out number 100-1 at least)</p>

<p>People would die.  It might be a reality.  I would hope not, but i think that would be the case.  They used 9/11 against us....to scare us into submission......and we bought into it.  Everyone is worried about &quot;terrorists&quot; now.  In the 90&#39;s it was the evil &quot;black man&quot; who they showed us in COPS, and whatever police shows are on TV.  Notice how many shows are on TV now that are all Police or CSI or what have you?  Are we programmed much?</p>

<p>We would have to tear down everything in this case.  Shots are fired, people would have to be removed.  They would have to be given fair warning, asked to leave to avoid injury or death and the system would need to be re-built by people who know that the system is there to serve the people, not the people who built the system.</p>

<p>It should be turned into a mundane system that any person can do and considered an honor to serve the country by doing a job that provided health care to all, young and old, sick and poor.  Everyone.  Consider the military budget the US has right now?  Turn that budget into one that support the country.  Think it wouldn&#39;t help at all?  Pfft.  That is only the part of the budget that we KNOW about.</p>

<p>It needs to be done in the name of the people, not in the name of the ALMIGHTY FUCKING DOLLAR.</p>

<p>Its time for the human species to be the priority and not the fucking few and the rich.  Not the ones that just happen to come first.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all the same.  We&#39;re all human.  We&#39;re all in this together, and we only get one chance at it.</p>

<p>Make your choice and make it happen people.  Are you worth fighting for?  Non-violently?  Answer and make it happen.</p>
