Don&#39;t cloud up the issue with unneeded minutiae. As the pieces get moved about, some of those same pieces make their own moves.                                          </p>

<p>The fact remains that those 2 countries are doing what they can to not be used as chess pieces by the PTB. Do I agree with their methods? What does it matter? I&#39;m just a pawn on the board, just like you.                                     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ptb realize their time is running out. They have been wanting to attack Iran for at least a decade.

    <div class="md"><p>I think China and Russia will get in the middle before anything happens. </p>

<p>I also truly believe that ten years later after our last false flag operation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the world community witnessed how much of a bully we were into going into Afghanistan and Iraq. It was a, &quot;trust us we know they did it&quot; type situation. They will be more skeptical on letting this happen again. </p></li>
<li><p>the Internet community and social media have grown out and helped offer different viewpoints on situations like this. Ten years ago we had no way of sharing articles, news bits, video, etc.. It was early in its infancy. Think of the Internet today as the printing press that helped the poor spread information more readily. If it wasn&#39;t for r/conspiracy, I dot know where I would find a more open and talkative place for differing viewpoints on conspiracy issues.</p></li>
<li><p>people realize after 9/11 and after Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld, that they were were just crooks and they felt compelled to try and change the world their way. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is too much scrutiny nowadays with us being the big bully. Eventually, I foresee someone saying enough is enough. Look at the people on OWS. They&#39;re providing evidence at horrible of a police state we are. You think Canadians don&#39;t see this and think, &quot;what the fuck is wrong with our neighbor?&quot;</p>

<p>People are starting to wake up. Piece by piece, people are getting sick of this 1984 totalitarian BS we spread. </p>

<p>Sorry. It&#39;s been a bad morning for me. But it&#39;s really how I feel about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No need to be sorry. You make very excellent points.</p>

<p>I would hope Russia and China step in before Israel and the US do something irretrievably stupid but who know what games they themselves are playing. This is my own conjecture, of course, but it could be that Russia and China wait till after an attack on Iran to step in and look like the good guys in the eyes of the international community for standing up to Israel and the US...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I hope that china and russia would get involved before it escalates to ww3, the &quot;people in charge&quot; will do everything they can to worsen the situation if they truly desire war - which means that russia and china will probably already be involved or busy via proxy wars. It&#39;s not like it will take much; russia already frowns at the US in afghanistan, and china is supporting pakistan almost as if to spite the US. Turkey is really distancing itself (relations soured recently) from israel and has a frightening military strength for such a small country. The whole region is a powder keg really, and it won&#39;t take a big spark to set it off. </p>

<p>The real problem lies in the fact that if israel is involved in ww3, which it no doubt will be, <a href="http://carolmoore.net/nuclearwar/alternatescenarios.html#scenario3">it might go ballistic on all its neighbors</a> and spiral out of control before anyone can step in and &quot;look like the good guy&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, I worry about Israel the most. They seem to take an all-or-nothing approach to foreign policy and they surely see themselves (wrongly) as some kind of defenseless victim threatened by the world. It really isn&#39;t hard to imagine how far they&#39;d go to keep that stature up. Not trying to give Obama credit where he hasn&#39;t much earned it, but sometimes I wonder if he doesn&#39;t kiss their ass to keep them from going ballistic, like the spouse of an abusive drunk. But then I look at his own administration&#39;s warmongering and think nah he&#39;s an &#39;abusive drunk&#39; too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, assuming the US won that war they&#39;d be sitting on a very large amount of oil. They&#39;d also have a huge population to release the corporations on and after the war (in which the US would almost certainly target civilian infrastructure) there&#39;d be plenty of juicy contracts up for grabs...perhaps even a major pipeline from the Caspian to the Indian Ocean.
There are definitely other reasons an invasion is so enticing. Removal of a regional power who is friendly to both Russia and China, direct access to the Caspian Sea, another addition to the encircling of Russia. Who knows what else there is?</p>

<p>He lights fire to the womens underwear he has on.</p>

<p>In my mind, pleading guilty and being a fifteen second news bite on the news seems like they don&#39;t want to really focus on the fact that case closed. No argument. No evidence to be presented. No questioning. It reeks of suspicion that he received something for pleading guilty.</p>

Also interesting that people in the military and FBI are saying the story isn&#39;t true. Looks like another war is coming our way. </p>

<li><p>or somehow magically die. Suicide or crazed American hell bent on killing Muslims who winds up killing himself.</p></li>

<p>Sounds crazy but I know if a plot to draw us into war is foiled, all bets are off and they would cut their loses in any way. Am I right in thinking this?</p>
