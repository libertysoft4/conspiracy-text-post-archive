        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Time and time again we&#39;ve been lied to by the mainstream media, and yet they still enjoy mass credibility. It&#39;s not only Fox News that&#39;s guilty of this, but CNN, NYT, Washingon Post, BBC and no even Al Jazeera who many have viewed as an unbiased source. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it time someone ousted these propaganda outlets? I was thinking of gathering videos of all the times they&#39;ve lied to us and expose them to everyone, sort of a black list of the people and media that have clearly lied through their teeth just to rile us up for war. Think Donald Rumsfeldt and his WMDs, every news channel that spread this lie, the lie about Al Qaeda, about the real events in Libya and so on. </p>

<p>These outlets and these people do not deserve our credibility. It has to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a about 2 years after finishing college, all I did was read news and watch fringe documentaries online.  </p>

<p>Coming to understand reality depressed me for several months, it was a difficult realization to uncover: Your society is based on a corrupt and unsustainable farce of consumption.</p>

<p>My dad is 70, he is a relatively intelligent guy. He adamantly tows the Democratic Party Line.  When I expose him to fringe information on current events I see a glimmer of recognition and then he retreats back to the party line.</p>

<p>I suspect he has consciously come to the conclusion that his world view is based on well established myths; and it would be too uncomfortable to tear it all down now.  </p>

<p>That is the only way I can account for a person who apparently has the ability to think critically in other areas (career, hobby, etc.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The strange thing here is that the larger portion of insightful, deep and undeterred comments, activism and exposure come from people who are in their 70s or older. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ron Paul (not a friend, but I have to give him credit anyway)</p></li>
<li><p>Daniel Ellsberg</p></li>
<li><p>Paul Craig Roberts</p></li>
<li><p>Ralph Nader</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Byrd (died 2010, senate and rhetorics until his last gasp)</p></li>
<li><p>Chalmers Johnson (died 2010, book authorship and interesting interviews until his last gasp)</p></li>
<li><p>many more, watch those Max Keiser shows (for example)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe those folks didn&#39;t CHANGE their opinions later in life, because they have been contrarians and citizen trolls earlier, but in terms of undocile (= responsible) behavior, those old vecks run rings around most younger pundits and politicians. And they know how to make a point. </p>
