We all see what is happening -- rich fuckers keep getting elected or appointed, and they do nothing to make things better, but only make things worse. There&#39;s no way the US military should be occupying two countries in the Middle East, and bombing the shit out of Libya, while at the same time the corrupt government in Washington is giving billions a year to the rich cocksuckers in Israel. People are fed up with this insane shit, but the media never talks about it, the justice system never prosecutes it, and the fucking poliitcians only do what they are told to do by the rich bastards who bribed them.</p>

<p>A likely scenario in the US is that protests turn to riots turn to massacres, and the massive police state which we&#39;ve put in place with the TSA and DHS will attempt to contain violence to smaller regions. Manhattan will be locked down completely and they might just just shut off the electric/water/comm and make it quick. Places like LA and Phoenix will be easily locked down since they have so few routes of egress. Fuel will be rationed and air travel impossible - basically everyone has to stay put. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you say that? I am still learning about it and forming my own opinions. However, we know that oil is a finite resource, that&#39;s a fact. I guess nature can reproduce it of course, but the rate is slow enough to be  ignored for the sake of this thread. So if we know there&#39;s a finite amount, and we&#39;re getting it out as fast as we can, at some point there is none left. We have the technology to find oil, we have the technology to see how much is there (even if no one shares their reserves numbers. So why don&#39;t you think that we&#39;re running out?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Would you say over 50% likely to happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That exact scenario, no, that was conjecture. I could imagine at least a hundred different ways this could play out. But that&#39;s close to the top of of the list and consistent with OP&#39;s question of will we see extreme fascism soon.</p>

<p>The part I AM certain of is that the rate of oil production has a bounding effect both on economic activity and the number of humans that can be sustained. And that rate of production will peak if it has not already done so in the last four years. There are many ways to reduce population ranging from peaceful things such as birth control to nuclear war. </p>

<p>If I had to put odds on something I&#39;d say that those broader predictons about peak oil are 99.99% likely to occur. What&#39;s the other 0.01%? I don&#39;t know, but since this is r/conspiracy I&#39;ll concede that the data could all be fake, the government could have already built some incredible facility that nobody knows about which uses nuclear power to extract carbon from the air and turn it back into liquid fuel, space aliens could land and show us how to fix all our problems... that sort of thing is what I&#39;ll put in the 0.01%.</p>

<p>Electricity is not the same as liquid hydrocarbons (unleased/diesel/propane/natural gas). Sure it can offset some fraction of that demand, but do you have a way to run our tractors and airplanes on solar power? What about all the mining equipment that we need to obtain metals, concrete, phosphorus etc. How will we convert our entire transportation infrastructure to solar/electric in time? Can we get enough lithium to make all the batteries we will need? Do we have the capital to build it all in time? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Average ppl have 2 choices: become a farmer and grow your own food or die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have the money yes the best strategy is to get some land right now and become as self-sufficient as possible. Or at least move to a place where your neighbors have land. Modern commercial farming, however, will become unprofitable due to rising input costs and difficulty getting your product to market. Future food production will be more organic, more local, and much more expensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the fact that every &quot;bio-diesel&quot; option, &quot;solar&quot; option consumes almost as much oil to produce. PVC is oil, the manufacturing plants used to make PVC or solar panels or whatever else use oil to lubricate the workings or even power the plant itself.

<p>According to Ray Kurzweil, it&#39;s less than five years, if we coordinated properly.  Won&#39;t happen; 10-15 is more realistic.  The Oil-collapse end-of-civilization scenario is absurdly unlikely.  </p>

Caling people anti-american if they don&#39;t like wars and anti-semitic if they&#39;re agains Israel&#39;s zionist regime. The system is rigged.

They had their chance with 9-11 and failed to sufficiently incite hate against the Muslim countries (granted they came close, but people are beginning to see the ruse for what it is). The economic meltdown is just a pre-planned poor-man&#39;s draft (Vietnam all over again) except I have a feeling the protest movement is going to be the one &quot;too big to fail&quot; this time around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right. Thus the whole fear mongering you hear in the MSM about the danger of hackers turning off electric plants, nuclear plants, satellites, government facilities and what not through the internet. </p>

<p>We are talking about control systems that have nothing to do with the WWW. Things that don&#39;t have any reason whatsoever to be connected to the internet and if some are, which is very unlikely for security reasons obviously, they would have class D or E ips.

<p>Tensions and tempers have been rising for <em>10 years.</em>  They&#39;re no higher than they were during Vietnam.</p>

<p>Wars can last an <em>absurdly</em> long time, but they don&#39;t last forever.  It won&#39;t happen.  People get <em>fed up.</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not see what makes the US so different from any other country that it is immune to revolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In almost every revolution in history, the people rose up <em>to cast off a perpetual, brutal dictator.</em>  Let&#39;s take a look at the Arab spring - In Egypt, Mubarak has ruled for 30 years.  In Yemen, Saleh has ruled for the same amount of time.  Bashar Assad, the so called &quot;president&quot; of Syria, also rules with an iron fist.  </p>

<p>Each time the French revolted, it was against a King.  In England - against a King.  But take a look at the Weimar regime in Germany - they were toppled <em>through democracy.</em>  Hitler was <em>popular</em>.  He didn&#39;t get swept to power by a brutal coup, he got there through <em>democracy.</em></p>

<p>Whenever a coup installs a brutal dictator, 99 times out of 100, they&#39;re replacing another dictator.  Sometimes this is a de-facto dictator - for example, a &quot;President&quot; who has won every election for the last 20 years, despite being in a supposedly democratic environment - obviously one so absurdly corrupt that it can&#39;t even be called a Democracy anymore.</p>

<p>America is full of incompetence and corruption - let no one convince you otherwise.  But I&#39;ve looked at history, and there&#39;s something the people need to understand: there&#39;s corruption, and there&#39;s <em>corruption.</em>  America is corrupt, but the nations where the &quot;democratic leaders&quot; have been forcibly overthrown are nations where the corruption was <em>exponentially worse.</em>    </p>

<p>Democratic nations - even coporation-controlled ones - have a pressure valve; it&#39;s called the polls.  They&#39;re not perfect, they&#39;re not incorruptible, but when the majority of people believe that violent revolution isn&#39;t necessary because they can <em>vote</em>, violent revolution is unlikely.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll briefly touch on the so-called &quot;extremists&quot; on either side of our spectrum.</p>

<p>The Tea Party - the right-wing nutjobs agitating right now - <em>are nothing new.</em>  They&#39;re just the newest incarnation of the Know-Nothing Party; we have seen them before, and they will disappear just like everyone else.  </p>

<p>OWS has a lot of publicity, but the people <em>actually</em> participating in it are a tiny minority; their voices will likely be heard.  I don&#39;t care what anyone says, but I&#39;m about 90 percent certain that Obama has a second-term sealed up; no Republican can convince the working-class he&#39;s on their side.  </p>

<p>Obama&#39;s second term will be different from his first; second terms always are.  Presidents have to spend the first four years worrying about re-election, and playing it safe; Obama will be bolder.  The Congress we have right now will fail - miserably.  By 2014, Democrats will have a majority in both houses of congress, and reform will pass.  The wealthy will be taxed again.  </p>

<p>To quote from Battlestar Galactica, &quot;All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again&quot;.  History is full of patterns, and the human mind hasn&#39;t changed that much.  Circumstances have, but they will adjust.  I am confident that even the greedy corporations will realize that they <em>have no choice</em> but to capitulate to the masses and allow a bit of redistribution.  The rich will have higher taxes, Obama will force us to have healthcare, and people will stop caring about whether or not he closed Guantamo bay, because Americans won&#39;t be worrying about where their next <em>meal</em> is going to come from.  We&#39;re a nation that is, despite what people tell you about debt, <em>filthy rich.</em>  There is <em>no</em> need for any American to starve.</p>

<p>Of course, <strong>I&#39;m</strong> not sitting here saying this with certainty.  I&#39;m not saying that the world is <em>definitely</em> going to be fixed along this timeline.  But it fits with previous historical patterns in this nation, and it isn&#39;t far-fetched at all; I&#39;ve pitched it to a number of economists and sociologists I know, and none of them have said &quot;that&#39;s retarded&quot;.  But I don&#39;t for a moment have the illusion that I know something that no one else does, and that I&#39;ve somehow predicted the future.  I&#39;m not saying &quot;GUYS, AMERICA IS GOING TO COLLAPSE IN A YEAR, ALL THE SIGNS ARE THERE, I&#39;M CERTAIN!&quot;, because history is <em>littered</em> with people who were certain of things that never happened; it&#39;s just another form of Harold Camping.  </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:  Fuck you, I worked really hard on this!  Read it, or move on!  Please?</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let me break that down for you as you obviously did not read my entire post. I on the other hand took the time to read all of yours very carefully, since I thought we were having an intelligent and civil discussion.</p>

<p>I made a prediction of a probable outcome based on information I have, followed by a statement admitting that things could just as easily go the other way. Yes I could have been more clear with the alternate possibility which seems to be the one you are most hopeful for if not outright sure of. The main topic of this discussion was the possibility of eruptions of violence over these protests, I tried to remain on topic.</p>

<p>When talking about tensions and other nations overthrowing dictators and what not, you neglected to mention the American Civil War. Which was a war fought by a democratic nation within itself. Thats the whole point of civil wars, they happen when the governed is fed up with the ones governing. Civil wars and revolutionary wars begin with some level of civil unrest, which is rampant in today&#39;s America. Yes democracy has a way that it can fix this but not if the people who write and enact legislation do so at the command of corporations.</p>

<p>That is where the civil unrest is coming from as more and more people are becoming fed up with companies and banks ruling over the people we elected to govern us. I understand that this can end peacefully, what you are incapable of comprehending is the impending doom ahead if things do not happen the way that they should. </p>

<p>Regardless of who is right or wrong in this argument as it truly only boils down to our educated guess for the outcome of this whole mess. These are just our opinions. While you have the right to your opinion, and I to mine, you are incorrect to attack me just because I do not share the same faith in our democracy as you do. Can we not simply agree that we disagree on the end result of this political movement?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this - I supported my argument with half a dozen historical examples that point to a pattern.  As I said, all of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The American Civil War had unique circumstances; people my tell you it was about federal oppression of the states, but it wasn&#39;t; it was about the Federal government <em>interfering</em> with the State&#39;s supposed right to <em>be oppressors.</em>  Slavery had to go, and the people in the South refused to accept it.  There is no singular institution which will have a similar affect; what, are we going to go to war over gay marriage?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Impending doom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The impending doom is such an unlikely path; the safeguards against revolution have to fail at <em>every</em> turn; there will be multiple chances for this path to be averted, and <em>every single one</em> must be ignored or bypassed.  I think it&#39;s impossible to say this is <em>likely</em>, as in a democratic nation, it&#39;s simply never happened before.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, as I said, the Civil War was about one group&#39;s desire to <em>deny</em> democracy to an entire group of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be that guy, but in my mind I&#39;ve been really wanting something like this to happen. Before you think I hate anyone, let me explain why I&#39;m looking somewhat forward to this. </p>

<p>We as human have replaced compassion, friendship, and all other moral values with materialistic shit. I worked at Starbucks, I worked at Apple Retail. I even worked in a casino at one time. I&#39;ve seen the worst come out of people who think they are entitled to treat hourly workers like shit. </p>

<p>I worked at a Starbucks in the Financial District of SF. I had the early morning traders who didn&#39;t tip. The people who came in and had zero patience for waiting on their drinks. You didn&#39;t get the drink order right? You got yelled at. You just had to take it because you needed the job because you were going to night school
To better yourself. But they don&#39;t know that nor do they care. </p>

<p>I worked at the flagship Apple Store in SF. I was the guy behind the Genius Bar who had to hear people complain their week was ruined because the iPod they had beaten up in their purse wasn&#39;t working.  They couldn&#39;t go to the gym without their precious iPod playing music for them to work out to. You had to talk to my manager because it was plain as day you broke your iPod and it&#39;s not covered. My manager comes over and makes me give you a replacement iPod this one time. Because you stomped your feet hard enough and got your way. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen videos, read books, read magazines of 13 year olds in Africa who are badasses with a knife or a gun. They have shit to do. Protect their village, fight in a civil war, they have to work their ass of for their livelihood. No technology, no BS media showing XFactor, no Starbucks, no 9 meetings. Kids have to go fuck shit up for their village. I&#39;m so looking forward to these people who dont know jack shit about anything outside of their own bubble survive when shit hits the fan in this country. </p>

<p>Imagine, infrastructure gone, military rule in place, have to scrounge for supplies. These assholes would have zero clue on how to fend for themselves. </p>

<p>It sickens me that this country has let it self become overrun by people telling us how to think. How buy shit from the freezer aisle. 1 click buying off of Amazon. We&#39;ve let society forget how we got here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m a Debbie Downer on this. When shit hits the fan, a good majority of the country will be at the mercy of someone smart enough to survive. I just snicker at these people who will have no clue how to solve their problems when the time comes. </p>

<p>Down vote all you want, this is how I feel we&#39;ve become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what &#39;people&#39; you are talking about. I&#39;m sure Iraqis would tell you that the wave hit them in 1991 and hasn&#39;t stopped since and so on and so forth depending on the example. </p>

<p>If you are asking if there is going to be a violent backlash/revolution against the criminal class soon, then i would answer, probably. They don&#39;t seem to be taking the legitimate concerns of the OWS movement seriously at all. There is also a rising police state that many are concerned about and eventually might want to form a resistance against. As long as there is gross inequality, no Bill of Rights, poisoned food, etc then people are liable to fight it by all means. And since the corporate state has had no issue using mercenaries and death squads in other countries in the past I don&#39;t think it&#39;s crazy to think they might bring these tactics home, like they brought assassinations home in the 60&#39;s. </p>

<p>I think you are witnessing the beginning of something that could get ugly but either way things are definitely going to change. Feels like history is up for grabs for the first time in a long time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To blame this &quot;wave of fascism&quot; on a single entity in the form of a corporation, comprised of many minds, is both naive and absurd and doomed for failure at the onset of such a movement against it if this is the sole reason, sole mindset of the cause and, sadly, I fear that for most participating this is the case;  if they even understand more than simply the act of injustice that is taking place on levels beyond that of the financial institution which had been created and persists today is but one form of control; you can be sure that another form will take its place as this one soon will crumble while the vast majority that those protesting, yes even you, are completely unaware of will remain wholly intact and their tentacles will remain imbedded deep into the very base impulses of the society of yesterday and today; tomorrow cannot come soon enough.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that this &quot;wave of fascism&quot;, as I was alluding to, is not monopolized nor is it a &quot;wave&quot;. To suggest that all the blame be placed upon them is the same as blaming one&#39;s bad breath on the sore taste bud on the very tip of the tongue for it is the one that causes you to take notice of the pain you feel/see yet the cause remains entirely elusive and completely irrelevant to why you have bad breath, when you feel pain.</p>

<p>Yes, I do tend to do that. &quot;Rant&quot;. On and on incessantly. There is much to consider and there is also much to be said. It is far easier to do with the anonymity of the interwebs.

    <div class="md"><p>It will get ugly because the mainstream media is part of the propaganda machine and not the free press it is supposed to be.  A free press doing its job would operate as a relief valve as it would be prosecuting in the court of public opinion the abuses of power - which in turn, in a correctly functioning free society, should vector towards real prosecutions.  </p>

<p>When the press can no longer be trusted to accurately reflect the mood of the country or express its frustration , at some point things could tumble into violence when the tipping point is reached where their collusion cannot be tolerated and public trust has completely broken down. This will take much more than a mere majority because the control it exerts can be precisely measured and has become a science. </p>

<p>But I sense we&#39;re edging close to that point given the tone of the press. It used to address a broader socio-economic range. Since 9/11 its focus has become narrower and lower. Lately more and more people are saying they think the country has lost its mind. We haven&#39;t lost our mind, we lost our media.  If it seems to a lot of people that what we see in the media speaks to increasingly less astute people, it&#39;s because it is. It needs to hold onto a large enough segment of the population to keep things from that tipping point and have enough people parroting the propaganda to aid in that goal.  It&#39;s getting to the point where the only people that will buy the propaganda and keep the tide of public opinion from tipping are the people incapable of understanding what is really happening - hence the lower socio-economic targeting of its propaganda. </p>

<p>What if people are getting set up to accept an even more brutal and fascistic system? If you&#39;re into the whole Hegelian Dialectical analysis, it&#39;s problem-reaction-solution in action. The unthinking mobs will be demanding &quot;real&quot; change, and you can bet these elites will have a system ready to replace the current one.

    <div class="md"><p>Why? The fact is there is MORE than enough room for all of us. In fact all 6+ billion of us could fit in Austrailia, each of us would have a quarter acre to live on, and there would be plenty of room in Austrailia left over. The rest of the world would be sans humans.</p>

<p>Take a plane ride and see how much uninhabited land there is all over the world. Yes, cities are overpopulated in many cases, but that has been done through social engineering by governments. We are easier to control and keep tabs upon when we are herded together.</p>

<p>Overpopulation is a myth that was first posited by Thomas Malthus. It is not true. There is also enough money and resources. Sadly, it is all in the hands of a few extremely wealthy families in the world, who came about their money by cheating the masses and continue to scam us through banking and laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human brain is designed to be overly sensitive to threats, to consider as many violent outcomes as possible. In an environment where bad things often do happen, it was better for our ancestors to be over-prepared than under-. And so we are a little bit sensitive, a little bit concerned, a little bit fearful when we generally needn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>Your brain is just perceiving a potential threat and making it important. If it doesn&#39;t happen, well, you wasted a few bucks on shotguns and bottled water. If it does, you&#39;re more likely to survive if you have acted on your concerns.</p>

<p>Look around r/conspiracy, if you want to know how people feel.  Jews are evil, Jews run the world, Jews did WTC...blood will run.  Sixty five years later, the antisemites have managed to convince themselves that the holocaust either didn&#39;t happen, or was perpetrated by Jews on themselves, so they had it coming, neither viewpoint being supported by evidence; the amount of absolute, vitriolic hate aimed at the Jewish people because of the actions of the government of the nation of Israel and a few corrupt bankers is absurd.  When one Jew commits a crime, Americans treat it as if <strong>all</strong> Jews have committed that crime.  This subreddit is <em>full</em> of people like that - tttt0tttt, UndergroundRecorder, Occidentalist, MartinTimothy, me_and_1, to name a few - who present the same antisemitic viewpoints without any unbiased evidence.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m really not, and <em>that&#39;s</em> the entire problem.  The vast majority of people I see on here who speak about zionism etc. also refer to <em>Jews</em> as a race, rather than just Israel.  If everyone were talking about how bad Israel is, I wouldn&#39;t be debating them; Israel is no friend of mine.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s not them, it&#39;s <em>the Jews.</em>  It&#39;s always about how <em>the</em> Jews control Wall Street, not <em>some</em> Jews, or even <em>the</em> Zionists.  The flavor of what I&#39;ve seen isn&#39;t <em>just</em> anti-Zionist; if it were, I wouldn&#39;t have such an issue.  It <em>is</em> anti-semitic.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been assured multiple times that this is just a <em>very</em> vocal minority, but I can only speak to what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel is an evil empire</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Israel is far from an &quot;empire&quot;, what with being the size of New Jersey, and being a democracy - albeit one controlled by idiot fundamentalists - but still, your point isn&#39;t <em>that</em> far off.  They&#39;ve done <em>terrible</em> things...and it should be pretty telling that the word I&#39;m debating is &quot;empire&quot;, not &quot;evil&quot;.  </p>

<p>But it isn&#39;t even Israel, it&#39;s the government.  We ask people to distinguish between the American people and the American government; why do the anti-Israel people not follow this standard?</p>

<p>On the third day he called all the sages together and said to them. &quot;Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion.&quot; They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest &quot;What do you think?

<p>The King then asked the kadi [a Muslim judge and scholar]: &quot;What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?&quot; The kadi answered: &quot;The religion of the Israelites is preferable.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon this the King said: &quot;If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham. </p>

But there is an air here - on r/conspiracy - of antisemitism.  My only goal was to get <em>these</em> people to take a long look in the mirror.  Apparently it won&#39;t work, since anyone who this post is directed towards only sees ZIONIST JEWS regardless of <em>where</em> they look.</p>

<p>To everyone else, no, I don&#39;t think America is antisemitic.</p>

<p>By the way: When Germany occupied 1/2 of Poland many &quot;Jews&quot; went east. <strong>The allies</strong> (Russia with help) <strong>killed 1/2 of all Jews that were killed during WWII</strong>. (In eastern Poland and Russia).</p>

<p>Also: ancient Israel divided into &quot;Judah&quot; and &quot;Sumariea&quot;, The &quot;Jews&quot; went to war with Sumarea. A &quot;Jew&quot; is by it&#39;s very definition &quot;antisemitic&quot;.</p>

<p>When someone says &quot;Jews are evil&quot;, they aren&#39;t saying &quot;LIARS AND THIEVES&quot;, they&#39;re saying <em>Jews</em>.  All Jews, everywhere.  You can claim no one is hating on these people, but you&#39;re just plain wrong.  </p>

<p>What a fucking disgusting false dichotomy.</p>

<p>This post is nothing but an attempt to call me a racist by setting up a &quot;Jews vs. the world&quot; scenario, as if all races and people are united in harmony against the Jewish menace, and as if by <em>refuting and fighting antisemitism, I am oppressing other peoples.</em>  </p>

<p>That is mvlazysusan&#39;s point. Are you unfamiliar with Khazaria? There is more than enough information in this sub to bring you up to speed.</p>

<p>&quot;ZIONIST JEWS&quot; are in that category. If not by blood, by indoctrination. Just because one has a differing view or stance does not exclude them from being a Jew, merely a Zionist. If there are any true <strong>Isrealite</strong> left I would be surprised.</p>

<p>Also, what is an &quot;American Jew&quot;? There is no such thing. A Jew is a Jew. Do not be confused by what you hear or see and in turn are lead to justify into believing.</p>
