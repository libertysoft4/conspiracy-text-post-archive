        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>4 years ago, Google was still censoring Bilderberg.  Last year the mainstream media was forced to acknowledge it, though only in the context of &quot;The people who think the UN is full of reptilian aliens and are worried about black helicopters think Bilderberg is the Illuminati meeting to discuss running the world&quot;.  </p>

<p>Of course, every four years coinciding with the US presidential election, the meeting occurs in Virginia, and the appointed nominee is in attendance.  Last election, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Politics/story?id=5012995&amp;page=1">Obama&#39;s staff kidnapped his press team on an airplane so he could sneak off to Bilderberg</a>.  How will Romney get away with it this coming weekend?</p>

<p>With over 50k subscribers, R/conspiracy could make a big play at bringing some awareness to the existence of this meeting.  What say you, r/comspiracy?  Any thoughts on how to get a Bilderberg related post to front page?  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bilderberg">Charlie Skelton Guardian article</a>?  TIL?</p>

<p>A concerted effort next weekend to bring awareness to this while it&#39;s happening could be interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I am always frustrated because the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; is functionally compromised out there in the wild.</p>

<p>I substitute for the word &#39;teamwork&#39; or phrase &#39;hidden teamwork&#39; to try and put the act of humans co-operating to achieve a goal back into perspective.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as if they&#39;ve forgotten that this is ultimately all that is ever being suggested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are told that those who believe in conspiracy are insane. We are taught this in school, in the media and in the family.</p>

<p>Yet if we examine our everyday lives, it is clear that it is in fact that nature of human beings to engage in conspiracy. Remember when you plotted with your friend to prank someone? That was a conspiracy.</p>

<p>This is will understood by any student of history. Indeed, the study of history is primarily concerned with three things: economic activity, armed activity, and conspiratorial activity (politics)</p>

<p>TLDR: Conspiracies are real, we engage in them all the time. Those who happen to be more powerful us do as well. Why is this so bloody hard to understand lawl</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;From a historical point of view, the only reaility is that of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Secrecy, wealth and independence add up to power.</p>

<p>Deception is the key element of warfare, (the tool of the power elites), and when winning is all that matters, the conventional morality held by ordinary people becomes an impediment.</p>

<p>Secrecy stems from a pervasive and fundamental element of our life in our world, that those who are at the top of the heap will always take whatever steps are necessary to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>The very label &#39;conspiracy&#39; serves as an automatic dismissal, as though no one ever acts in secret. Let us bring some perspective and common sense to the issue. The United States comprises large organizations- corporations, bureaucracies, &#39;interest groups&#39;, and the like- which are conspiratorial by nature. That is, they are hierarchical, their important decisions are made in secret by a few key decision-makers, and they are not above lying about their activities. Such is the nature of organizational behavior. &#39;conspiracy, in this key sense, is a way of life around the globe.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Rockefeller’s own words spoken before the secretive Trilateral Commission in June, 1991, when he said:</p>

<p>“We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries.”</p>

<p>Edit: Disputed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Purported remarks at a Bilderberg Group meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany in June 1991, The remarks are said to have been printed in several right-wing French publications shortly thereafter; as quoted in Programming, Pitfalls and Puppy-Dog Tales (1993) by Gyeorgos C. Hatonn, p. 65. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: More info: <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:David_Rockefeller#Bilderberg">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:David_Rockefeller#Bilderberg</a></p>

<p>So English translated into French then back into English. </p>

<p>But looking at his other quotes and quotes from other Bliderberg members, it is consistent with their goals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much agree the word conspiracy may taint any post pointing to the fact that these people will be meeting in secret. I think it would be a good idea to xpost it to places like r/occupywallstreet, r/ronpaul and r/911truth to raise the issue to where it could land on the front page. You could also do a TIL about the Bilderberg and lay some hard facts down about it!</p>

<p>I remember Hilary Clinton being fined under the Logan Act for attending one year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out why he labelled that link as anything to do with Bilderberg. He snuck out to go to Dianne Feinstein&#39;s house for a meeting with Hillary Clinton, his recently-ex opponent for the Democratic nomination. Feinstein was an OG Hill supporter, so it doesn&#39;t seem odd she&#39;d offer up her house- especially when Obama/Clinton fight got nasty in the primary, it&#39;s not strange to make sure feelings are smoothed and you&#39;re not airing dirty laundry in public. VP selection isn&#39;t usually a public process, so ditching press is just par for the course. Who knew anything of Palin or Cheney being the pick before they were? I struggle to see anything about Bilderberg, or indeed anything weird, in that link.</p>
