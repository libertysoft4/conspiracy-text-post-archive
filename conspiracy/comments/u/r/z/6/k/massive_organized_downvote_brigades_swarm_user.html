    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, but the heart of the problem is that people you neither know or trust are subtly affecting your opinion.  This is also known as <strong>GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT</strong>, because when you believe things that are untrue, you have a very high chance of doing something stupid.  You didn&#39;t know any better, and that was by design.</p>

<p>This is tragic, because people who have the best of intentions end up doing terrible things.  American soldiers don&#39;t want to do evil...  But they are...  And I believe that&#39;s why the suicide rate is so high.  A life of evil is not worth living so the it&#39;s probably the most noble soldiers who are opting out of life.</p>

<p>This needs to stop.</p>

<p>People you neither know, nor like, nor trust should have no sway on your opinion.</p>

<p>The trash must be kept OUT of your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I was doing well till a couple of weeks ago then suddenly got hit with these downvote brigades. I can rarely get anything to move more than a few votes. For every upvote I get I get a downvote. </p>

<p>And there may be a cabal. But more and more I suspect the reddit admins. And if they are doing it it is because they are told to do it. We all know about shadow banning but that&#39;s easy to detect. But if they have a program to add downvotes to anything someone submits, that would work as well. And that you wouldn&#39;t detect except when it breaks the pattern of normal votes and then you&#39;d have no proof.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve been here 4 years, have 249k karma, I KNOW how voting runs. And it is getting the first two or three votes that is the hardest. But suddenly I get a downvote for every upvote till I almost always have 0 or 1. </p>

<p>So while there might be the Israeli cabal behind some of it, I think it&#39;s a very nasty little country that I&#39;ve criticized on reddit and that could make me a target, but more and more I think it&#39;s reddit. It started when I argued with some mods. They deny its them and it probably isn&#39;t, but it did start then. </p>

<p>But they are ruining reddit. </p>

<p>They totally ruined <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> till it is just a feeder site for corporate media and corporate media comes precensored. I&#39;ve read how the CIA had agents in all major US media. I suspect reddit has gotten big enough that British Intelligence has taken over <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. And someone is doing the same thing to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Almost every submission has a corporate logo next to it now. </p>

<p>Well, they fix it so we can&#39;t know so I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m thinking of trying digg. See how it runs. See if you can move stuff without being part of a cabal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like they&#39;re ever going to get that cat back in the bag, LOL</p>

<p>Seems like the tsunami of PR money unleashed prior to a national election imparts a sense of invincibility to the conspiracy; but afterward, the horde of liars, and their lies, submerging the truth always wash back out to sea along with it, leaving the truth jutting even more boldly from the sands of time. We&#39;ve seen it several times since that particular crime was perpetrated, like a machine stuck in repetitive-but-pointless activity. Exposure is something the conspiracy cannot adapt to, so it keeps doing what it has been programmed to do, whether it works or not.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make it crystal clear.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t take orders from <em>anyone</em>. To me, Reddit is a source of interesting news and entertainment. Occasionally I&#39;ll have a brief chat with someone.</p>

<p>Seriously, how would ordering someone to downvote an article even work?</p>

<p>&quot;You there - downvote all the things!&quot;</p>

<p>Even if you did feel compelled to listen to some ridiculous individual on Reddit <em>ordering</em> you to do something, how the Frigg are they going to know if you actually did it or not?</p>

<p>imagine if a nazi hate group had a subreddit with thousands of subscribers, and they posted a link with the title <em>&quot;stupid asshole retarded jews smearing hitlers name again in r/politics&quot;</em>. would you even question the fact that it is an alert to downvote?</p>

<p>No it won&#39;t.  Generally speaking - no it won&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of rational people out there that hear and believe facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;d be surprised at how often and quickly the supposed rational mind cowers and rebels when it&#39;s presented with rational evidence suggesting and showing that the world is VERY, <em>VERY</em> different than how we&#39;ve been brought up to believe it is.</p>

<p>You see, rationality is often nothing more than a thinly veiled vestige of emotional security brought upon by years of societal conditioning since childhood (infancy actually).  Oftentime, what one is brought up to believe is true during their formative years they cling to regardless of whether or not they get data possibly contradicting it.</p>

<p>This, of course, does not apply to everything, but one would simply be remiss in thinking that human beings are more rational than they are.  Often, we are little more than a thin veil of faux rationality thinly covering a mountain of charged emotional perspectives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you can actually show something to people, some of them will accept it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  <em>Some</em> of them will.  Depending on what that something is, however, that &quot;some&quot; will be a <em>very</em> small percentage.  As much as we&#39;d like to not believe this, I&#39;m sure both you and I would likely have been two of the untold many that believed the world was flat way back in the day.  I&#39;m sure we would have also been in the group crying &quot;Crazy lunatic!&quot; to the first person to propose that it the planet was, in fact, round.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Misinformation and spouting theories as facts is no better than the worst of Fox</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh and no one here is arguing with that - at least not I.  This statement was not even necessary, as it was not even part of my point to allege anything different from this you mention sentiment here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and just drives away the truly intelligent people that could actually help uncover truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it depends on who and what you consider &quot;truly intelligent&quot;.  You&#39;d be surprised at how many PhDs, doctors, and scientists are just as dogmatic and rigid in their way of looking at things as the next religious bigot.  You might also be surprised at just how much knowledge you can find living between the ears of some people most would consider loony or insane.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if it wins anyone over, it&#39;s by lies which I personally could never stand for, and only attracts those that can&#39;t think critically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is fair.  I personally fully agree with this and the sentiment.  However, even the theory of critical thinking must be critically analyzed and examined for the faults that might exist within.</p>

<p>There are simply so many variables involved regarding certain issues that one would be ill-advised to write almost anyone off as loony or uncritical.  Even in the craziest theories, remnants of the truth might be found that may not be contained anywhere else.</p>

<p>Wow.  Come one, man.  Please, <em>pllleeeease</em> don&#39;t prove me wrong in giving you the benefit of the doubt and thinking that you just might not be a complete idiot.</p>

<p>Did you read or understand anything that I said?  Let me try it again:</p>

<p>I said that it is important to understand that there is validity and truth in a LOT of things that we might not initially think are such.</p>

<p>Also, look at your sentence and its structure:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So.. you really think that we should spread misinformation and exaggerations in hopes of tricking people to believe what you believe?? Or just take issue with anyone believing in others?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can also be justifiably looked at and interpreted in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So.. you really think that we should...just take issue with anyone believing in others?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you really mean that?  You really think I&#39;m saying that we should &quot;just take issue with anyone believe in others?&quot;?</p>

<p>Man . . . [deep breath here].  Again, come on now.  Please.  Some critical thinking on your part is really needed.  You&#39;re like literally falling directly into the hole you tried to dig in your previous statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or have zero belief in others yourself and have to convince everyone of that (which is a paradox in itself)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the <em>fuck</em> are you talking about?  Seriously, man.  <a href="http://legalgeekery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/wtfjackie.jpg">What the fuck?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If none of those...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  None of these.  Not even close.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure where the argument is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There <em>is</em> no argument on my part.  I&#39;m just saying people shouldn&#39;t tend to discount data as quickly as they often do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>except that you want to talk generally and I think the individual is worth the effort</p>
</blockquote>

<p>. . . perhaps English is not your first or native language.  Not quite sure, again, what was just said here.</p>

<p>...which makes the frightening stupidity demonstrated all the more impressive.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m personally not speaking with regard to or dealing with r/conspiracy as a whole.  I&#39;m talking about ME.  Even so, however, r/conspiracy has it&#39;s finger a LOT closer than almost any other subreddit to the pulse of just how fucked up things are on this planet, so even though there are a few posts that stray a bit left of the field, anyone would be approaching the very apex of uncritical thinking if they disregarded the slew of valid posts simply because some in the group were not sound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is almost exactly like debating young earth creationists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet you would actually be entirely erred if you discarded <em>all</em> the proclamations made by even such individuals.  I&#39;ve not spent too much if any time debating young earth creationists or looking into what they say, but I personally wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there is a specific something in their theories that is not only true, but unlocks a particular piece of the overall puzzle that other theories that are overall a lot more sound might have entirely missed.</p>

<p>Such is the manner that things work on this planet, and anyone unaware of this reality does themselves a great, great disservice.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t say &quot;you people&quot; in an alienating and discarding kind of way.  You&#39;re part of them, as am I, as is everyone.  &quot;You people&quot; doesn&#39;t represent me, because I didn&#39;t then nor am I now claiming creationism as being the &quot;only&quot; answer.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, but the heart of the problem is that people you neither know or trust are subtly affecting your opinion.  This is also known as <strong>GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT</strong>, because when you believe things that are untrue, you have a very high chance of doing something stupid.  You didn&#39;t know any better, and that was by design.</p>

<p>This is tragic, because people who have the best of intentions end up doing terrible things.  American soldiers don&#39;t want to do evil...  But they are...  And I believe that&#39;s why the suicide rate is so high.  A life of evil is not worth living so the it&#39;s probably the most noble soldiers who are opting out of life.</p>

<p>This needs to stop.</p>

<p>People you neither know, nor like, nor trust should have no sway on your opinion.</p>

<p>The trash must be kept OUT of your mind.</p>
