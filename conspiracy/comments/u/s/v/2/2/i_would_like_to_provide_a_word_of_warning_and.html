        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed lately, that a lot of violent suggestions have been surfacing on this sub-reddit. I would suggest that caution be taken when replying or most definitely agreeing with people when they say things that are violent and could be portrayed in a certain manner. </p>

<p>We all know and have heard of the recent ploy by CIA and other groups to recruit and eventually bust &quot;terrorist&quot;. These terrorists end up being disgruntled Americans who would normally most likely just complain about government and get on about their day. However; in these circumstances they are tricked and coerced into performing terrorist acts only to be busted and the CIA sits back and says &quot;oh see, we need to blah blah blah with america because we have terrorists on our own soil&quot;. </p>

<p>So i request that my fellow brothers and sisters be careful, because as it stands, we DO NOT know who is on this board and i could very well see a government funded project to gather sources from a place like this being put into effect.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and be careful out there.  </p>

<p>EDIT: I would like to address some concerns but first and foremost i would like to thank everyone for their input from both sides of the fence. Some of you seem to think i am telling you to be passive and not be violent or to actually censor yourselves, this could be further from the point of what i am saying. Whatever your opinions are and what you feel should be done...that is fine and it is your own to do with as you please. My concern was that we all be careful with what we say when we don&#39;t know who we are saying it to. If you are on here blasting government and stating that we should do &quot;blank&quot; to them and there happens to be one of the people mentioned in my post here looking for people to put in some entrapment plot....then you have made yourself a prime suspect. Also, at the same time, my request was that we be cautious WHO we agree with when that person might be preaching some anarchy type movement because you never know what that persons true intentions might be. I thought this was made clear in my post, however; i apologize if what i wrote was confusing... English is my first language. :) </p>

<p>Nobody is watching you. Remove your tinfoil hat and start being rational.</p>

<p>Tell me, Who wants to browse a subreddit that thinks there&#39;s a cabal that wants to rule the world, and at the same time has a democratic system installed to serve the people. See? wasn&#39;t that easy? America is a democratic state that is transparent and hides nothing.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s something wrong in the country the media will tell us. Only our enemies will tell us that our country is bad, which is certainly not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not big on the whole, &quot;they&#39;re out to get us&quot; schtik either. this being said, I have to call a &quot;little bullshit&quot; on your comment. it&#39;s almost like you are swinging the pendulum the other direction. I think most people would agree with the fact that there is a power elite in every culture. And that power elite exists to protect itself and it&#39;s interests. And that it has much more concentrated resources than do the average John Q Public. And that the interests of the average citizen may sometimes clash. And that when this happens, John Q Public will usually be on the losing end, be it through whichever means necessary. </p>

<p>cheaper labor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gay agenda, black civil rights, the berlin wall, and the acts of gandhi had no direct affect on labor cost, except in instances when labor became <em>more</em> expensive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>capitalists wanted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The falling of the Berlin wall, yes, you are correct. The &quot;capitalists&quot; were and remain against civil rights, gay rights, and most decidedly did not want a free India. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not revolutions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By your argument, only revolutions are violent and only violence is revolutionary. Going in circles. </p>

<p>How about the adoption of the internet as a revolution? Non-violent, global, fast, world changing...? Does it qualify or does a revolution require direct political representation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black civil rights did have an effect on labor costs. As did women working. </p>

<p>Like As Upton Sinclair wrote in The Jungle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The first family had been Germans. The families had all been of different nationalities–there had been a representative of several races that had displaced each other in the stockyards. Grandmother Majauszkiene had come to America with her son at a time when so far as she knew there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district; the workers had all been Germans then–skilled cattle butchers that the packers had brought from abroad to start the business. Afterward, as cheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away. The next were the Irish–there had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a regular Irish city. There were a few colonies of them still here, enough to run all the unions and the police force and get all the graft; but most of those who were working in the packing houses had gone away at the next drop in wages–after the big strike. The Bohemians had come then, and after them the Poles. People said that old man Durham himself was responsible for these immigrations; he had sworn that he would fix the people of Packingtown so that they would never again call a strike on him, and so he had sent his agents into every city and village in Europe to spread the tale of the chances of work and high wages at the stockyards. The people had come in hordes; and old Durham had squeezed them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and grinding them to pieces and sending for new ones. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agents of northern factories came not just to Europe but to the American south, recruiting poor people, mostly blacks, to come north and work, and break the unions. At the time most unions did not accept black members so blacks were a great scab workforce. </p>

<p>But capitalists do want more and more cheap labor to compete with more expensive union labor, usually white male union labor. </p>

<p>And I consider a revolution to be a change in the form of government, to increase the number of people who have political rights. Which most of the things you describe were not. </p>

The american public for all their guns couldn&#39;t win a civil war between gov forces and citizens today so their best hope is to convince the lower end players in the government that they are serious and NEED to be listened to.

<p>It is a pity that you cannot see social change unless it is violent or explosive. I think that is a result of your shortcoming, not a lack of non-violent change. The Pirate Party is a good example. Huge social change happening.</p>

<p>The reality is that intellect is the first casualty of war. When shit begins to come off the rails, the radical or extremes gain more followers. Watch the news and see Neo Nazis at Euro 2012, preachers gaining support for putting gays in cages, protests and clashes in the streets tagged as gangs of lazy troublemakers. </p>

<p>I am amazed at the growing levels of group ignorance throughout the world. The vast majority of people do not understand or care about the nuances behind protests and many sitting in front of their TV would not mind seeing a few skulls cracked to regain &quot;order&quot;. If you are a regular on this thread, you have probably been personally exposed to the squelching of healthy dissent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to stand up for your beliefs; teach your children to stay rational and smart, &quot;disobey&quot; like Gandhi would, speak up, when you can. This fact must be mixed with the grim reality that in the current economic world climate, the monkeys are running the zoo, for now.   </p>

<p>The problem with taking a stand when in your 40s or 50s is that you have economic needs to provide for a family.

<p>The thing is.....if people keep this mindset we will <strong>never</strong> have the numbers you speak of. The movement will <strong>never</strong> gain momentum if it&#39;s comprised of people 40 and under. <strong>You</strong> hold more power in an OWS protest than my 27 year old body does. People see <strong>you</strong> down there, a 40+ with kids and a mortgage, they will see that it ain&#39;t just <strong>jobless hippies</strong> asking for a hand out. We need more metaphorical <strong>mirrors</strong> in OWS so people can see themselves in it and apart of it. </p>

<p>If America keeps seeing me down there, 27 year old dreadlocked white guy, they will find nothing in common and assume them and I are fighting for different things. They start seeing you and I, arms locked protesting the same thing, they <strong>will</strong> pay more attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Even if you never go to a protest you can help. Just educate as many as possible. Keep posting and asking questions. People like myself understand the front lines aren&#39;t for everyone. We know we need people behind the scenes. </p>

<p>I have no family or kids so I&#39;ll be down there laying my life on the line for you and your family. We need you to be the normal guy that tells the rest of the world that us weirdos are fighting for good, not anarchy. </p>

<p>We can do this. Everyone is learning their roles. To be honest, you can do more from your computer than I can do on the streets. I&#39;ve got faith in us, in people. </p>

<p>I greatly appreciate the open mind. Remember every little thing helps. Just staying active on sites like this means more than you can believe. The more subscribers to this subreddit, as well as others, gives me so much hope. It&#39;s a sign that people are waking up and catching onto the bullshit they&#39;ve been sold. I notice it and <strong>they</strong> notice it as well. And as you, sort of, said it&#39;s a numbers game and our side is starting to bring way more out of the gray and into the light.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to agree with this part of your post. Whenever the people in power (who are not the politicians) think they can get away with a war, and profit from it, without too much blood splashing back on them in their cushy Manhatten penthouse apartments and Cape Cod beachfront mansions, they trigger a war. It changes the whole dynamic of a society, and gives them a fresh start to repeat their rapacious predations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add a side note. Yesterday I read that an Americans chances of being killed by a &quot;terrorist act&quot; are the same as them being killed by their own furniture. It seems true. </p>

<p>Also, the fear, and the fear-mongering are born out of TV and the internet for us today. For example. If a kid gets beaten by another kid in a school-bus in Oklahoma, it gets plastered all over national television giving the impression, and delivering the picture as if that phenomenon is &quot;sweeping the nation&quot;. The images are often met with &quot;Oh, my. People are <em>cray-zee</em>!&quot; When in fact just that kid doing the beating in Oklahoma is quite crazy, and even then we don&#39;t know the back-story. </p>

<p>Another truth is that the vast majority of Americans are basically good, and non-violent people. Just walk out on your street and you&#39;ll find that your neighbours are not all shooting each other, setting fire to things, or fighting in the streets. Even in the worst neighbourhoods violence happens as a small slice of the day. Furthermore, people are basically good, people all over the world are basically good. It&#39;s the media telling you that people are &quot;all crazy&quot; that &quot;the world is going insane&quot;. </p>

<p>If you were to watch youtube video after youtube video of violence from lets say Mexico or Afghanistan, it doesn&#39;t happen to people like that. It&#39;s not back to back like youtube videos, violence happens and then there is a lull (Battles in a war are an exception of course, and not a part of &quot;everyday life&quot;.)  </p>

<p>thank you for bringing this to light.</p>

<p>ain&#39;t it nice having a government of, by, and for the prople attacking those same people on so many fronts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re encouraging all of us not to express our real opinions, out of fear that they will be used against us by the authorities? We should self-censor ourselves so that the government doesn&#39;t need to bother to make the effort to censor us? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s why we come here.</p>

<p>The reality is, the American government is the enemy of the American people. If Americans want the country to improve, they need to oppose the government. Those charged with enforcing the will of the government over the people, with regard to all the new anti-privacy and anti-freedom regulations that have spewed out of Washington over the past decade, are acting contrary to the Constitution and the rule of law. They must also be opposed.</p>

<p>Edit: sorry mods, not saying you are wrong for that position either as I&#39;ve discussed with &quot;ContheorySpiracist&quot; just that the nature of the subreddit makes it very difficult to remove off topic posts without rants about censorship.  I think most of the mods are doing a great job for the position they are in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my life goals (that I&#39;m never actually going to pursue) is to get picked for one of the FBI terror plots. I&#39;ll then go to the local cops and get a wire. Then when it comes time for the FBI to pull their little sting I&#39;ll arrange things so that the local cops are a few blocks away along the proposed travel route. The local cops will then bust the FBI agent provocateur. </p>

<p>Unfortunately there are a few things that will make this never happen.  </p>

<ol>
<li>I&#39;m not muslim. </li>
<li>I&#39;m not brown.</li>
</ol>

<p>The current trend is that only people who fit one or both of the above categories can be targets of FBI terror plots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another fatal flaw... </p>

<p>There&#39;s always the hope that someone is either incompetent or ambitious. Also there was that mosque a few years back that called the FBI on an FBI agent* who was trying to set up a terror plot.</p>

<p>*Not an actual agent, but on the payroll for this sort of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is that you&#39;re considering this subreddit a &quot;family&quot; and not a beacon for actual crazy people who aren&#39;t interested in evidence or facts. The kind of people who gravitate toward things with a &quot;conspiracy&quot; label are often assholes spewing nonsense, that&#39;s mislabeled as &quot;misinformation&quot; or whatever.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some tight-knit group where important discussions are happening, it&#39;s an almost 60,000-person large group where links relating to &quot;conspiracies&quot; are aggregated and commented on. Nearly all &quot;original discussion&quot; here is just the same old tired bullshit, or gifs of fucking wtc 7 going down. Even the legitimate ideas get beaten to death and then traipsed around constantly to the point where anyone who participates in discussion is automatically lowered to the same &quot;loony&quot; status.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any big, overarching conspiracy here, it&#39;s that it was so easy to group like-minded people in an area where any great ideas they actually have are lost immediately in the torrent of bullshit and sock puppets and ron paul haters/fanatics and what the fuck else ever.</p>

<p>There are real places on the internet where real people can group together for real discussions on these kinds of things, but why would you expect anything but normal &quot;conspiracy&quot; and reddit bullshit in a conspiracy subreddit? And why would it need to be blamed on any larger conspiracy? This just lends credence to the whole &quot;paranoid-tin-foil-motherfuckers&quot; stereotype which makes it hard for true discussion on really, really fuckin&#39; important things.</p>

<p>Any community that gets this large is automatically subject to the lowest common denominators. Infowars forums, anyone? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No unorganized violence please. Other than acting as a trigger for the inception of a &quot;true&quot; police state, it becomes a gateway for Al-CIAdea false flag terrorism attacks around the country (this time putting the blame on &#39;domestic&#39; terrorists). OUr best bet is to fight with our dollar, until hyperinflation a la Zimbabwe happens. At that point, once people will no longer be able to afford the basic neccesities of life, most will no longer fear death, and be ready to revolt. This is my firm belief why Big Ben hasn&#39;t actively engaged in QE3 and QE4, because of what hyperinflation may do to this country. Remember that there are something like 2 million registered gun owners in the state of Vermont(?) alone. Big Ben and his zionist puppet masters do not want a mass uprising. Especially that cock-sucking shill, Brzenski, who&#39;s main goal for the last ~70 years has been the implosion of Russia. And we all know why.</p>
