    <div class="md"><p>I have not subscribed to cable services since 2007. The other day I was at a local Mexican restaurant and they had a TV playing the new Regis and Kathy Lee show (I don&#39;t know the new peoples names, some gay guy and a reasonably attractive woman). But anyways, they had a game show segment where people would call in and they would spin a wheel to win a prize. All the ringing and lights when they spun the wheel on the TV nauseated me and the way the hosts talked to the people was like watching a grown up talk to a five year old. I couldn&#39;t wait to get my food and get the hell out of there. I&#39;m not sure if TV has always been this way or if my perception has just changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You perception has changed. The same thing will happen to professional wrestling fans. If you watch pro wrestling all the time, you start to buy into the narrative and it begins to look real to you. But if you stop watching it for a year or two, and then take a look at it, you are amazed at how completely silly and phony it looks, and you wonder how anyone could watch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People full of fear.  Thats a little judgemental no?  So do you just ignore the fucked up game of life outside your little relative world??  Read everything, trust none of it, think for yourself, question authority.  While I do agree with some of the ways to de program oneself.  Please be more specific .. the internet is pretty much television now .. so you want me to shut my laptop and go outside .. What if I live in NYC, where Im subjected to forced adverts and radio waves anyway .. should I move to the middle of nowhere now ... ????????</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I agree with the &#39;full of fear&#39; comment. We all share a fear of success and a fear of failure in our peers&#39; eyes. 
Our greatest fear however, is not of being inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
We set (and I mean the entirety of the human race) our own barriers that disallow abundance and happiness. 
We all have different ways of manifesting this fear in our lives. Some ignore it, others try to hit it head-on.
My point: everyone, absolutely everyone, has a juxtaposition to fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And thats one gigantic assumption.  We all share a fear of success and a fear of failure in our peers&#39; eyes.   I honestly don&#39;t give a shit what my peers think about me .. As I handle my own shit and put in work to get what I want .. hence success in my own frame of light .. I can insert a famous quote too .. hmmmmmm Whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Saying people are full of fear when all you have is a screen and text to base this off of .. is very disturbing.  If you can .. can you go into more detail about how you are using &quot;fear&quot; here.  All Im thinking is that people are afraid of the dark because they don&#39;t know whats there .Fear of unknown??  Im not in anyway attacking you personally here .. if it feels like that .. It is not my intention .. my intention is to learn from you by asking questions to things I do not understand.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, expected more than cheap slogans from the thread title.</p>

<p>Might I suggest snatching a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_Rising">Prometheus Rising</a>.  It incorporates Korzybski and Leary neurological/psychological theory (among others) into amusing anecdotes and thought exercises.  It approaches human conditioning and thought process from a highly theoretical view, but the main point of the book is the experimental exercises that can be used to better understand how the mind works.</p>

<p>Also, I would read up on Lacanian psychoanalytic theory (Žižek is good on this).  Also be familiar with famous texts such as the Platonic dialogues, Machiavelli&#39;s <em>The Prince</em>, and Marx&#39;s <em>Das Kapital.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good suggestions, but I&#39;d put it this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>stop watching television</li>
<li>stop listening to radio news</li>
<li>stop reading the newspaper</li>
<li>stop reading news magazines</li>
<li>stop listening to rap and hip-hop</li>
<li>be aware that movies are propaganda</li>
<li>stop watching professional sports</li>
<li>stop taking unnecessary drugs</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d say stop watching movies, but I believe this is not necessary provided we understand that every new movie released is a propaganda vehicle, filled with messages designed to brainwash the viewer. Once you know this, it is sort of fun picking out the various propaganda messages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A necessary drug is a drug you need. I&#39;m surprised you need anyone to explain this for you. Maybe you take too many unnecessary drugs ... those would be drugs you don&#39;t need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I agree with the &#39;full of fear&#39; comment. We all share a fear of success and a fear of failure in our peers&#39; eyes. 
Our greatest fear however, is not of being inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
We set (and I mean the entirety of the human race) our own barriers that disallow abundance and happiness. 
We all have different ways of manifesting this fear in our lives. Some ignore it, others try to hit it head-on.
My point: everyone, absolutely everyone, has a juxtaposition to fear.</p>
