The whole point of researching conspiracy&#39;s is to have our mind blown. I&#39;m noticing with the Tila Tequila, and the Zombie craze tons of people in here are quick to jump to the drug conclusion and absolutely dismiss all other evidence. I do not think these people are who we think they are. If you give people a faux explanation they stop searching for the truth. Strength in numbers. If you get a bunch of &quot;people&quot; to agree with you, then it MUST be the truth [sarcasm].</p>

It was all fun, but maybe certain people should be putting down the zombie movies, zombie games, and zombie survival guides if they cant tell the difference between fantasy and reality.  Nothing discredits a conspiracy theorist more than when they buy into obviously laughable bullshit.  If you want to go on some tangent where you think its the government trying to scare you away from it, then maybe you should be looking at the person who is suggesting that it may be true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can withhold your consent, even in today&#39;s society. The global aristocracy&#39;s members have not worked a day of human labor in their lives. You can do the same, you just can&#39;t buy as much stuff with which to enjoy your leisure. </p>

<p>The concept of a &quot;job&quot; appears to me to be obsolete. It seems likely to me that the unemployment rate will never go down again unless workers are enslaved for war purposes. Mechanization will see to that. Human labor appears to me soon-to-be largely obsolete, and in a world worth living in this would be cause for celebration, freedom, unparalleled leisure, an abundance of the arts, an extreme focus on and easy funding for top-notch education (lots of free time for lots of people), peace, and asymptotic acceleration of technological innovation.</p>

<p>Instead, we live here, where lightbulbs are intentionally designed to be less efficient than when first invented centuries ago (we have the internet and conflict mineral-mined palm supercomputers, yet are still enslaved by an internal combustion engine technology unimproved upon in a significant way since 1838), and the same miracle of mechanization dooms millions (billions?) to destitution, debt, homelessness, and ultimately early death on account of extreme, lifelong, perpetual trauma. All of these concepts should be as obsolete as human labor, because they are all equally optional.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t learn to withhold your consent in today&#39;s society, you&#39;ll never be part of building the one we deserve.</p>

<p>Then a lot of the conspiracies that you would likely label &quot;fantasy&quot; do have some shady parts to the accepted story. 9/11 and Roswell are two good examples of this. Certainly enough to make you think twice about the world you live in. </p>

Many of the medications people use now cause withdrawal symptoms when discontinued so if the supply was stopped I think you would have some pretty messed up people jonesing for their drug of choice.  The street drug people are just rookies in comparison to the syndicated pushers.  Their system is full spectrum. 
Of course, you are correct if their pills were adulterated then you could end up with mighty weird behaviours.</p>

<p>Before Ivens was able to finish his “message,” this report says, the three American Diplomatic Security agents, who trail all Russian diplomats in the US, began to “surge” towards Ivens causing him to flee.
According to US news sources, Special Agent Ivens, after leaving downtown Los Angeles, returned to his home in Burbank whereupon he then fled into the rugged Verdugo Mountains after which a massive manhunt for him ensued involving 100 FBI agents, 40 sheriff’s department rescuers and a dozen local police officers.
FBI officials stated to the local media that Ivens was “distraught” and “might be suicidal” adding that they believed he had in his possession his service weapon. At no time, however, did anyone ever state as to why Ivens would be in such a state.</p>

<p>According to other US news sources, Special Agent Ivens graduated from Braintree High School in Massachusetts 18 years ago and was selected by his fellow students as “shyest” in his class. He was further described by FBI colleagues as well liked, a devoted agent with no history of disciplinary action on the job, and according to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller “Married with a one-year-old child, he has been working for the FBI for the past three years in the national security area. Prior to that, he worked as a Los Angeles police officer for eight years.”
Late yesterday, after the massive manhunt failed to find any trace of Ivens, his wife Thea Ivens issued an urgent public appeal stating: “Steve, if you are out there listening right now, your wife wants to let you know, ‘Babe, we are in this together for better or for worse. I love you, no matter what happens.’ Your child wants you to know, ‘Daddy’s work? Daddy home?’”</p>

<p>Even more bizarre about this case, this report continues, is that the retired FBI agent named Donald Sachtleben mentioned by Ivens, who also knew about this impending “plot,” was arrested within hours of Ivens disappearing and charged with trading child pornography.
Most important to note about Sachtleben was, aside from his being an over 25-year veteran of the FBI, he was a special agent bomb technician before retiring in 2008 who specialized in counterterrorism and bombing investigations and whose most important case was the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York City.</p>

<p>According to US news reports about Sachtleben’s arrest, this most knowledgeable of FBI agents openly traded child porn using the e-mail address ‘<a href="mailto:pedodave69@yahoo.com">pedodave69@yahoo.com</a>’ in an act so stupid for one of the United States most highly trained intelligence agents it defies belief.
The practice of US intelligence services charging their most feared dissidents with child pornography and/or sex charges is well known, with the most celebrated case being against the former UN weapons inspector William Scott Ritter, Jr. who warned about the lies being told to the American people in the run-up to the Iraq War only to find himself sent to prison on trumped up charges involving a minor girl.</p>

<p>To exactly what kind of false flag plot Agents Ivens and Sachtleben had uncovered this report doesn’t say, other than to note that the credibility of this information should not be dismissed due to how fast and hard US intelligence agencies are acting to cover their tracks should any additional information come forth.
Grimly to be noted is the use of false flag operations by the United States and their political elite classes are well known and well documented, the most famous of them being Operation Northwoods.
Operation Northwoods was a series of false-flag proposals that originated in 1962 within the United States government, and which the Kennedy administration rejected. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or other operatives, to commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities and elsewhere. These acts of terrorism were to be blamed on Cuba in order to create public support for a war against that nation, which had recently become communist under Fidel Castro. One part of Operation Northwoods was to “develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington.”
Operation Northwoods proposals included hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of phony evidence that would implicate the Cuban government. It stated: “The desired resultant from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere.”</p>

<p>Several other proposals were included within Operation Northwoods, including real or simulated actions against various U.S. military and civilian targets. The plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, signed by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer and sent to the Secretary of Defense. Although part of the U.S. government’s Cuban Project anti-communist initiative, Operation Northwoods was never officially accepted; it was authored by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but then rejected by President John F. Kennedy.
As the events of Oklahoma City and 9/11 prove, however, the appetite for false flag operations against the American people by their own government is far from sated, with the next one, undoubtedly, being the worst of them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Occam&#39;s razor: a principle urging one to select among competing hypotheses that which makes the fewest assumptions and thereby offers the simplest explanation of the effect.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam&#x27;s_razor">wikipedia</a></sup></em></p>

<p>On reddit, however, Occam&#39;s razor is applied as &quot;which story seems more ridiculous when I describe things <em>this way</em>&quot; - which is just rhetorical BS. </p>

<p>The ridiculous labeling of &quot;excited delirium&quot; as &quot;zombieism&quot; is one of the side-effects of social media (e.g., &quot;If we give it <em>this</em> headline, everyone will notice it!&quot;). But, Occam&#39;s razor has no credibility on reddit. Here&#39;s why...</p>

<p>Two different arguments about 9/11 truth, using Occam&#39;s razor.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Version one:</p>

<p>Which is more likely? </p>

<ul>
<li>That thousands of government and corporate agents all conspired together to orchestrate this grand scheme to kill a few thousand US citizens so that some oil barons (yet another tier of this grand plan) could steal Iraq&#39;s oil. And all of those thousands of people have successfully remained silent about this all of this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or...</p>

<ul>
<li>some terrorists hijacked some airplanes and flew them into buildings. </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Version two:</p>

<p>Which is more likely?</p>

<ul>
<li>Some evil Muslim terrorists, led by Osama bin Laden (a Saudi), orchestrated the most aggressive attack on American soil in the last 50 years, penetrating the world&#39;s most sophisticated defense system. And they coordinated all of this from a cave in Afghanistan using a cellphone and a laptop.... and they managed to convince the US government to blame Saddam Hussein and to invade Iraq.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or...</p>

<ul>
<li>the people with the technology to do this did it.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor, on reddit, is a cop-out for not having sufficient information to defend yourself. Don&#39;t use it. EVER. And, if you see someone else use it, analyze the shit out of what they&#39;re saying, because odds are that they&#39;re bullshitting <em>someone</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s razor is useless for almost all kinds of social interactions. This principle cannot be used to explain history. If you don&#39;t know the relevant facts, you have to research more. If you are unable to collect additionel information, countless unverifiable explanations remain. You cannot assume that the simplest scenario is the most accurate explanation.</p>

<p>Many of us on r/conspiracy likes a good mystery to solve. Some of us come up with our own conclusions. You have 57,658 readers subscribed. Unless you have overwhelming evidence to convince the subreddit readers. Don&#39;t complain when a percentage come on and disagree. It&#39;s part of the way the world works to disagree among ourselves. The world would be dull if we all just merrily went about agreeing with everything.</p>
