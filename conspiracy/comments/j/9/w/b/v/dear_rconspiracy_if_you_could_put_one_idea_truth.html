    <div class="md"><p>Voting is undeniably necessary in any free society.</p>

<p>&quot;Voting against our politicians in droves could at least help in identifying voter fraud/election rigging.&quot;</p>

<p>To vote against one politician, you have to vote for another.  The reason approval ratings for Congress are at record lows is a result of American citizens knowing there is a systemic virus of special interest buying out sociopathic hack politicians that say premeditated talking points, and this has infected Washington for decades. It&#39;s an indictment of both parties for having sold out.</p>

<p>Two potential steps in the right direction.</p>

<p>1) The more revolutionary move would be to have a direct democracy where the citizens vote for legislation themselves as Gerald Celente has been recently advocating, though he shouldn&#39;t be credited as the first person to come up with this idea.  There are still problems with a direct democracy.  Media outlets could still sway public opinion through disinformation and fear into making serious voting mistakes, and then there&#39;s always voting fraud. It&#39;s clear to see how this is an improvement over voting for the best politician money can buy.  The internet would be invaluable for the dissemination of news and information that mainstream media would suppress.</p>

<p>2) An impetus to assert a fair opportunity for third parties into the mainstream US political arena.  Like two competing giant corporations mutually in competition to any fairness from other businesses, the Republican and Democratic parties mutually thwart any challenging third party candidates by dominating the US mainstream media outlets.  Once again the Internet needs to play a major part here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you would argue (I assume) that with voting, there was substantial political change? 
Although the OP does not specify the time (women&#39;s suffrage, civil rights, GLBT rights, etc.. all came via voting power), would you say any substantial political changes have occurred in the last decade thanks to voter turnout?</p>

<p>Protip: Electing Obama was not substantial political change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you lack any understanding of currency at all. Gold has been used as representation of effort for 2700 years, which sort of makes your points regarding it&#39;s application irrelevant. Golds value does not derive from its applications. It comes from the fact that people agree to trust that it is hard to forge, takes effort to recover and has a stored value.</p>

<p>It has been used because of it&#39;s relative scarcity and difficulty in recovery. It is a representation of stored value. I.e I invest time and effort growing a crop, I exchange that crop for gold and the crop is consumed. The only lasting item is the gold, which is a representation of the value or effort invested in growing the crop. That stored value could be represented as sea shells and it would still be valid. Only sea shells are easily recovered, and therefore not as effective as gold. (note: some random society did use a rare form of seashell).</p>

<p>Paper notes are derived from promissory notes, which represented a tangible asset such as commodities or gold (stored value). They are easier to transport and exchange, and upon standardisation became a common currency, redeemable for gold (stored value). Watch any of the videos pointing out fractional reserve banking and you will see they applaud a paper issued currency which is redeemable.</p>

<p>There is <strong>nothing</strong> wrong with paper money, the problem usually resides with the value represented by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where the problem lies.  That is what I was alluding to.  I was mostly responding to your comment that it has the plus of being shiny and pliable.  It&#39;s 
applications go way beyond that.  I&#39;m sure if there are extra terrestrials observing us or discover our planet in the future on of the biggest jokes among them is going to be that we used gold to make jewelry and back our fancy colored paper that we use to trade for goods and services.
Your history lesson aside, I&#39;m pretty sure we haven&#39;t gone by the gold standard in some time.  Wouldn&#39;t it stand to reason that the value of gold, then, is in it&#39;s applications?  Much like oil, diamonds and other natural resources?  I am not, unfortunately, an economist or expert on natural resources but I&#39;m sure you are an economist, geologist and all around expert on everything on this world and others so please educate me and the rest of my poor fellow ignoramuses.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really don&#39;t know? Precious metals have a value that is independent of what the government says, or wants. Nobody can &quot;place a value&quot; on gold, it simply has a value. When that gold is in the form of a coin, then the coin has a value because of the gold that is in it -- a universal, timeless value. Paper money on the other hand, is a piece of paper. It&#39;s value is all illusion. To grant paper money value, you must engage in magical thinking. If the government collapses, that imaginary value, which never existed in the first place, vanishes instantly -- because it was never real.</p>

<p>What the fuck are you talking about? What value does gold have that we have not placed upon it?  <em>Nothing</em> has value that we do not place upon it. It doesn&#39;t even have any practical uses outside of the fact that it conducts electricity slightly better than copper and other such metals. Its too soft to use to make useful tools. People place value on it for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Its shiny</li>
</ul>

<p>and</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s rare (not extremely rare, but kind of rare)</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of those things makes it inherently more valuable than anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gold is valuable because it is valued. It has always been valued. That is how human beings regard it, as a substance of great worth. Paper, on the other hand, is just paper. It can be associated by a governing authority with an abstract value -- a value that at one time was measured by an amount of gold -- but it is just paper. A piece of paper has no particular value, even a piece called &quot;money&quot; -- because it&#39;s still a piece of paper. The illusion of value attached to it vanished as soon as the government that claims to back it falls. Gold, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t need anyone backing it. It has always possessed value, and probably always will. Is this a good thing? A bad thing? An indifferent thing? Who the fuck cares? It is the reality. Gold has a value that is not conditional on governments or banks or on the form it takes or on what is printed on it or on who possesses it. Hence, an intrinsic value.</p>

<p>What the fuck is wrong with you people? This stuff is so fucking obvious, I feel like I&#39;m explaining addition to 5-year olds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about The Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The United States treasury states that approximately two-thirds of the entire sum is the public debt. In other words, the money the United States government owes the people, businesses, and foreign governments which purchased treasury bills, notes, and bonds. The remaining one-third is owed by the government to itself.</p>

<p>Lets discuss that one-third the “government owes itself,” because that statement is misleading. When the money borrowed from the public,  businesses, and other countries did not cover spending, the government decided  to borrow from its trust funds such as Social Security. It withdrew funds from  these sources because at the time they were in surplus. However, they were only in excess as long as the working taxpayers contributing didn’t need to utilize the  funds for their intended purposes. Therefore that one-third the government “owes  to itself,” it actually owes to the American people.</p>

<p>As people of this country, citizen or immigrant, it is your solemn duty to relieve or punish those whose hands you have put your well-being and who should take your well-being and strip it bare and even sell that well being to the highest bid.

As a country now is the time to unite; now is the time to stand up and reclaim your dignity and light that torch once more; to be the beacon for humanity as we once were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the moment of greatest terrifying clarity came about when I accepted the narrow scope of most people&#39;s attention, time and competence.  That was when I realized there were almost no large scale conspiracies, no masterminds behind social norms and institutions, and many many offices and committees actually attempted to work pretty much as they describe themselves.  There is no one behind 99% of the cameras in the world, and those that are would mostly capture a lot of nose picking if the feed was reversed.  For all of us, at least most of the time, whether citizens, business people, secretaries, politicians, bureaucrats, officers, or vagrants - we are just looking for something to which we may agree or consent.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the boundaries imposed on the existence of any person on this little ball of silicon dioxide, magnesium and iron exist only in our minds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(37) His disciples said, &quot;When will you become revealed to us and when shall we see you?&quot; </p>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;When you disrobe without being ashamed and take up your garments and place them under your feet like little children and tread on them, then will you see the son of the living one, and you will not be afraid&quot;</p>

<p>(38) Jesus said, &quot;Many times have you desired to hear these words which I am saying to you, and you have no one else to hear them from. There will be days when you will look for me and will not find me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>here&#39;s the most important passage (this next paragraph):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(39) Jesus said, &quot;The pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (gnosis) and hidden them. They themselves have not entered, nor have they allowed to enter those who wish to. You, however, be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.&quot;</p>

<p>(40) Jesus said, &quot;A grapevine has been planted outside of the father, but being unsound, it will be pulled up by its roots and destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p>(41) Jesus said, &quot;Whoever has something in his hand will receive more, and whoever has nothing will be deprived of even the little he has.&quot;</p>

<p>(42) Jesus said, &quot;Become passers-by.&quot;</p>

<p>(43) His disciples said to him, &quot;Who are you, that you should say these things to us?&quot; </p>

<p>&lt;Jesus said to them,&gt; &quot;You do not realize who I am from what I say to you, but you have become like the Jews, for they (either) love the tree and hate its fruit (or) love the fruit and hate the tree.&quot;</p>

<p>(44) Jesus said, &quot;Whoever blasphemes against the father will be forgiven, and whoever blasphemes against the son will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either on earth or in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>(45) Jesus said, &quot;Grapes are not harvested from thorns, nor are figs gathered from thistles, for they do not produce fruit. A good man brings forth good from his storehouse; an evil man brings forth evil things from his evil storehouse, which is in his heart, and says evil things. For out of the abundance of the heart he brings forth evil things.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>of course that&#39;s radical historical revisionism if you ask most atheists or christians.  but somebody wrote all that shit and stashed it away in a jar for a few millenia.  and i think they probably had a really fucking good reason.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t believe in the afterlife.  just saying, for clarity&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>of course those are Christian texts that were uncovered later.  if you&#39;re a radical creationist and don&#39;t believe in carbon dating (like a true idiot), you can look right in the bible for some similar passages:</p>

<p><a href="http://nasb.scripturetext.com/matthew/23.htm">http://nasb.scripturetext.com/matthew/23.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples, 2saying: “The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses; 3therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them. 4“They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger. 5“But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments. 6“They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues, 7and respectful greetings in the market places, and being called Rabbi by men. 8“But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. 9“Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. 10“Do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, that is, Christ. 11“But the greatest among you shall be your servant. 12“Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. </p>

<p>Eight Woes</p>

<p>13“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. 14[“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.]</p>

<p>15“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.</p>

<p>16“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.’ 17“You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold? 18“And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.’ 19“You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering? 20“Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it. 21“And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it. 22“And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.</p>

<p>23“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others. 24“You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!</p>

<p>25“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean 
the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence. 26“You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.</p>

<p>27“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. 28“So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</p>

<p>29“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, 30and say, ‘If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ 31“So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 32“Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers. 33“You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell?</p>

<p>34“Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city, 35so that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 36“Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never mentioned Nazism.  America is plenty fascist, and the idea is fascist. </p>

<p>&quot;Why let the sick and weak breed?&quot;  Maybe because the right to control over your ability to have children is a natural right?  Why on earth would anyone have the authority to decide who is and who is not fit to breed?  You may argue that science can determine who has the &quot;best&quot; genes, and therefore, who should be allowed to reproduce.  This simply ignores the fact that human beings are incredibly diverse, and we have a number of talents and strategies for surviving.  You can&#39;t place a value on something that is qualitative and call it objective.  Secondly, any type of program that is meant to &quot;purify&quot; will almost certainly be used to &quot;wipe out&quot; the enemies of the group that decides who can reproduce.  Whether or not the factors used include race, human nature will guarantee this type of program will be used to wipe out certain groups of people (Critics of the government in particular).  The biggest drain on humanity is not the poor and weak.  It is the people in power that deny the poor man his basic human rights.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a billion people. At <em>most</em>, maybe 10k who are actually committed to this in the grand global scheme. The rest are followers who would be detered from the ideology of oppressing the masses, if the masses were to surgically remove that 10k.</p>

<p>Once it became certain that the masses no longer tolerate such things, and have the capability to implement precision targetting of oppressors... the ideology of oppressing would  disappear in a heartbeat.

They are 2% of the population, yet contribute 50% of the campaign money to the Democratic Party, and 33% to the Republican Party. Jews control the mass media in America -- and by control, I mean they own it, manage it, and determine what gets into it and what is withheld from it. By controling the media, they control the propaganda, and have the ability to engage in long-term social engineering ... which they have done.</p>

<p>Even if they were totally benign, it would be an unhealthy situation for the nation. But they are not benign. They have a Zionist agenda, and it is in conflict with the best interests of America.</p>

<p>do you have any evidence that the Rothchild&#39;s run the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is  what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>There are a great many people weilding power (especially money as power),  so... to answer your direct troll questioon: No. I don&#39;t have proof of <em>that</em>, specifically. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s plenty of evidence to indicate that very few people have ever weilded their power so dominantly nor for as long as the Rothchild international banking family has for the past 300 years. While others have come and gone, it&#39;s been the Rothschilds who have always come through things smelling like a ~~ rose ~~ skunk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not questioning the power of the family through history and you could be right, they may be silently running the world behind the scenes.</p>

<p>However, they don&#39;t appear to be the richest people in the world, they don&#39;t appear on the radar much in international politics, and they don&#39;t appear to be dominant in the banking or media world.</p>

<p>As such, to me at least, it seems like a lot of insinuation and speculation.</p>

<p>Now the thing that I notice when you have a large group of people in the conspiracy community talking about the Rothchild&#39;s as evil, and all of the jewish bankers as evil, and all of the zionists as evil, is that theirs is a movement to blame all of the world&#39;s problems on the jews (without any evidence).</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m sorry but until you can provide me with some substantive evidence that the Rothchild&#39;s are running the world according to a zionist playbook, I will continue to suspect that anti-semitism and ignorance are fueling your ideology rather than a sincere attempt to make the world a better place. </p>

<p>If a troll is someone who insist on better evidence than youtube videos with scary music then yes I am proudly a troll.</p>

<p>Again you troll. And, the rest of your post discounts any evidence one might even attempt to reference. All youtube videos are out, no matter how credible. Any lack of evidence where there should be some (ala, media silence) is ruled out. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve framed your troll argument to preemptively discount, disregard, and dismiss anything anyone might want to try to offer.</p>

<p>You are a troll, troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not very familiar with what substantive evidence is, are you?</p>

<p>If the rothchild&#39;s are ruling the world surely there is real substantive evidence. Documents, bank statements, correspondences, legal documents, memoranda, contracts, court rulings, diplomatic papers, etc... etc...</p>

<p>There is a wealth of forms of evidence I am receptive to. Please offer me evidence.</p>

<p>Anyone can invent evidence out of thin air and post it on youtube but that doesn&#39;t exactly make it good quality evidence, does it?</p>

<p>If you are supporting your entire world view without credible evidence, you are the victim of propaganda.</p>

All of reality is made of individual units combining with each other to manifest new levels of reality. Everything is essentially one, the multiplicity, variety, and subjective nature of reality we experience is a product of this process of becoming. When you embody this understanding in action there is no other, only another yourself that is packaged and developed differently and you seek only to help that other understand that there is no other.</p>

<p>Most people on reddit would consider this (with my amendment) to be entirely accurate.</p>

<p>Most people would also agree that most corporations are owned and operated by non-jews. </p>

<p>In this scenario, however, you would solve the fundamental political problem of our time without sounding like a racist. </p>

<p>Imagine how much more influence you could have if you took this road? You could still hate jews in private, but you&#39;d be far more effective at creating substantive change in America. Which I presume is your goal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are, I assume, being deliberately misleading, since you seem intelligent and articulate. I don&#39;t hate Jews. Nowhere do I say such a thing. Why would you say such a thing? It is an insult, and also happens to be completely untrue.</p>

<p>I call attention to the disproportionate power held by Jews in the United States because I see it as a problem for the future of the country. There is no hate involved. Jews have a huge amount of power and influence -- an amount of power far above their percentage of the population -- and they use it to forward their own ends, which often conflict with the best interests of the people of America as a whole. That&#39;s the problem. Hate doesn&#39;t figure into it.</p>

<p>Anyone who doesn&#39;t hate gypsies doesn&#39;t know gypsies.</p>

<p>Were you honest enough to admit that gypsies are the scum of the planet and should be exterminated like rats?</p>

<p>David Duke is right on the money in everything he says in this video. Everything. How I wish we could vote Duke into the White House.</p>

<p>The Nazis were received with joy by the German people because they were actually able to get things done. They turned the German economy around, while at the same time excluding Jews from positions of economic authority. </p>

<p>The only thing they have against attacking Iran and killing thousands of Iranians (for nothing) is that it might backfire and result in Zionist deaths. That&#39;s how truly evil they are. I mean, these creatures are not even human.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s hoping they lynch Netanyahu. He really, really deserves it.</p>

<p>Hitler&#39;s goal was not to kill the Jews -- it was to remove the Jews of Germany from positions of wealth and power, because he regarded the Jews as traitors to Germany.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to two conclusions that, I guess, make me a conspiracy theorist.
One is that vaccination and innoculation are probably causing problems such as increased autism.
Two is that cell phone use increases the chance of cancers, particularly brain tumors.</p>

<p>What? The blacks now running South Africa are a bunch of corrupt incompetents? Well I&#39;m just shocked, that&#39;s all, shocked. Now who could have predicted this? Oh. That&#39;s right. All the white South Africans.</p>

<p>Pakistan is what happens when you let a Mulsim population grow in your non-Muslim country. It is invariably a bad idea to allow Muslim immigration.</p>

<p>Tell her she&#39;s an asshole and beat her with a stick. Probably won&#39;t do any good, but you will have had the satisfaction of having told her that she is an asshole, and beaten her with a stick. That counts for something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes I do, I play devils advocate all the time. As I know I can switch my opinion on the matter at any time. My opinion doesn&#39;t matter that much anyways.

<p>But like I said, on the internet, anything goes, you have to embrace the random. Therefore I think someone, even one person could be able to manipulate the popularity strongly but possibly having multiple bot accounts on a grand scale. It&#39;s quite feasible to achieve very easily. I mean it may not necessarily be true at all, but it&#39;s definitely in the cards, and it would be stupid to count it out entirely. Evidence is key of course, but without the ability to prove or disprove, you just have to keep an open eye and mind. That&#39;s pretty much the only reason I read this sub reddit at all really, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same for you in some sense.

    <div class="md"><p>You really don&#39;t know? Precious metals have a value that is independent of what the government says, or wants. Nobody can &quot;place a value&quot; on gold, it simply has a value. When that gold is in the form of a coin, then the coin has a value because of the gold that is in it -- a universal, timeless value. Paper money on the other hand, is a piece of paper. It&#39;s value is all illusion. To grant paper money value, you must engage in magical thinking. If the government collapses, that imaginary value, which never existed in the first place, vanishes instantly -- because it was never real.</p>

<p>Again you troll. And, the rest of your post discounts any evidence one might even attempt to reference. All youtube videos are out, no matter how credible. Any lack of evidence where there should be some (ala, media silence) is ruled out. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve framed your troll argument to preemptively discount, disregard, and dismiss anything anyone might want to try to offer.</p>

<p>You are a troll, troll.</p>
