        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was about 7 months ago, I was a member of Facebook, and had a fairly large (knew everyone personally) group of friends, and a very active news-stream. It was around this time that I became very interested in the Truth Movement.</p>

<p>I would often post links regarding 9/11 truth, and other various theories. I began to notice that certain links I posted to the news-stream would be instantly moved to the bottom of the page, and in some cases COMPLETELY IGNORED, they would never enter the stream. So I knew I was being censored.</p>

<p>This was around the time when the Alex Jones V for vendetta thing was going on, and I decided that I liked the idea of an upside-down pyramid to convey my dislike for globalism. I found a picture of an pyramid from a dollar bill, and edited it in paint to look like a V, highlighting/outlining the V it&#39;s self. I then tried to post it to the news-stream, it was ignored.</p>

<p>I tried a second time, this time it worked, but not only did it post the intended picture, it also posted a very sensitive picture from my hard drive I took of some marijuana while at a friends house over a year ago. Anyone that uses Facebook knows it&#39;s virtually impossible to mistakenly post unintended pictures.</p>

<p>You have to first select the picture (which wasn&#39;t even in the same folder), then you go to a confirmation page, just to make sure you want to share it. So there is not just one confirmation, there is two. The picture of marijuana was not in the confirmation, I NEVER SELECTED IT. Yet, there it was, right next to the upside down pyramid.</p>

<p>I knew right then and there that I had been hacked, the contents of my hard drive had been reviewed and or downloaded by someone concerned with my point of view. I decided immediately that I would cancel my account. </p>

<p>During account cancellation they ask you why you are leaving. I put something down like &quot;something very strange is going on here, you win&quot;. They also have you type a human verification thing. You know, those little boxes with gibberish that are nearly impossible to read and almost never actually spell a real word. Well in my case, the word I had to type was &quot;cornered cat&quot;. </p>

<p>The entire experience freaked me out, and I no longer use any social networking. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what the intended outcome was all along. To scare me into not sharing the links I was finding, and to not make upside down pyramids...</p>

<p>IMHO, FACEBOOK = CIA</p>

<p>Facebook is intentionally hiding your anti-globalism pictures, and scanning your hard drive and uploading pictures of marijuana as well, in an effort to... discredit you?  Their CAPTCHA system is also in on it, and generated a suggestive phrase to mock you on your way out?</p>

I believe in the 9/11 Truth Movement but you really have to use some sort of common sense. What you are describing simply is not possible. The man-hours it would take would be phenomenal and the pay-off completely worthless. The reason your links go missing is because they have been marked by many other users as spam and are automatically blocked. Everything else IS A COINCIDENCE. You can believe in certain conspiracies and the existence of coincidences. It&#39;s not a either or choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that this comment is at +7 is also an indictment. You&#39;ve addressed one aspect of my post, man-hours. Your defence against the argument that it would simply not be possible to scan all pictures posted to Facebook for anti-Government material, then scan your hard-drive AUTOMATICALLY for incriminating evidence. How does it pick up a picture of marijuana? Then it will replace your picture with this magically found image, then its Captcha system for no reason at all will generate a mocking phrase. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE without human intervention and this would not in any way be a worthwhile use of time for any agenda they have planned no matter how crazy you are. FFS people think.

    <div class="md"><p>Pompous words? &quot;I knew right then and there that I had been hacked, the contents of my hard drive had been reviewed and or downloaded by someone concerned with my point of view.&quot; The problem with your creepy Facebook experience and so much of the paranoid ramblings you find here is the sheer arrogance in assuming anyone gives even a microscopic fuck about what you&#39;re posting to Facebook. They gave so much of a fuck that they hacked into your computer and uploaded a picture of marijuana! Wow. We&#39;ll never agree on anything as you&#39;re capable of writing that phrase seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah yes, and this is where you are wrong. you&#39;re assuming that whatever I was posting was common knowledge, stuff that has no real significance, things not sensitive to any intelligence agency the world over.</p>

<p>if you knew me you&#39;d also know that I spend up to 14 hours a day scanning the internet in different fucking languages, translating those articles in to English, and reading them. when you&#39;re as obsessed as I am in searching for the truth on issues surrounding, war, false flag events, social engineering, and manipulation of the media, you occasionally find the truth. </p>

<p>the notion that an average citizen can&#39;t post something of great concern to this nations intelligence division is laughable. I shall now quote JFK.</p>

<p>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.&quot;</p>

How is that relevant to you believing this conspiracy extends to slightly scaring you on Facebook? Why remove it from your Facebook?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In science rational assumptions are often based on theories&quot;. Yes, well I guess you could even say that a theory itself is simply rational assumptions made on the basis of surrounding facts which is then itself tested. The drivel you are spewing could even be called a theory, the facts that it is based on however are extremely tenuously linked to the hypothesis you are driving towards and as we test your conspiracy theory we find it lacking don&#39;t we? Oh a quote from someone about social media sites being open to investigation which starts with &quot;I think&quot; which you are trying to use as supporting evidence of your theory that Facebook engages in active censorship of Anti-Government sites and employs people to root through people&#39;s hard drives for pictures of marijuana which they can then post for no reason. In their spare time they create vaguely threatening captchas for these people as well. You are saying Apples are Purple, I am saying prove it and then you blather on about it being obviously true because Oranges are orange. You fail in every single one of your responses to address or strengthen your own argument. As involved as you are in now trying to win this ridiculous non-contest for the sake of your own self-improvement try and see the flaws in your arguments. </p>

<p>&quot; I&#39;m saying that there is not a policy regarding certain sites, such as conspiracy sites, 9/11 truth sites etc. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have no policy against specific sites. How do you think they detect spam? I still stand by the fact that you&#39;re completely retarded.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is because those links / articles have been marked as spam by a large percentage of the people who have seen that previously posted link.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not &quot;a policy&quot; you crazy crazy man. I&#39;m saying that there is not a policy regarding certain sites, such as conspiracy sites, 9/11 truth sites etc. How do I know that their policy of removing spam isn&#39;t applied to certain websites? I&#39;m sure it is once those websites are marked by enough people as spam. Do I work for FB now? Can I use logical thinking to see the glaring holes in your crazy assertions, yes. As to your final sentence, do you honestly think Facebook roots through every anti-government site someone posts there and adds it to a big list of sites to &quot;make disappear&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly I don&#39;t think it was an automated system that pulled the picture, and posted it to FB. Though I do think it was an automated system that discovered me.</p>

<p>in other words, I think there is an automated system that searches for people linking to certain sites, or posts that express an anti-establishment point of view. I think that the worst of the automatically discovered dissenters (depending of course on their posts), are then handed over to real people, hackers, to discredit, scare, whatever...</p>

<p>I think the US Government is scared shitless that civil unrest and riots will break out in America, as they are in the UK. i also think a majority of that unrest will be a result of alternative news sites, and blogs...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the very first class meeting our Prof introduces himself as an important figure in Republican strategy and a speech writer for Nixon and Reagan.  Everything was going normal until I felt as if someone was staring at me. I turned to my right in the direction of the classroom door and a young man wearing a suit and tie was staring at me. I returned the eyeballing and immediately he  twisted back behind the doorway. Wow , I thought, this isn&#39;t going to turn out to be spooks in training..? After the first hour Prof struts around the class speaking about war and just retelling much of what the Govt wants us to think about war, nationalism, patriotism, etc...He looks stright at mmy eyes and begins to speak about how Arab hijackers perp&#39;ed 911. raises his voice and exclaims with a giggle that if anyone thought 911 was an inside , youd have to be completely insane. classroom goes alone with it and giggles abound, meanwhile I sat there poker faced debating whether or not I should argue this point by simply saying, &quot;building 7&quot;. I sat there in silence while he looks to me slyly continuing on about political idealism. I look to me right again and two of these young men as ONE eyeballing me like the Three stooges one on top of the other from behind the door jam. Wow, I thought, i never thought this would happen to me because of what I had been adding to myspace page. The only thing I could possibly think of as to why this would be happening. I guess they do research on their students beforehand...what to do you think? Think I was being monitored and it just so happens these were the local guys? Very unnerving event. Thats basically the story. I had written a long essay about the Illuminati and had many truth articles on my myspace page, since deleted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some of you are not taking into the account the fact that FB was used to help start the Arab Spring, which has so far resulted in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. To say that a grass-roots movement starting on FB couldn&#39;t turn into something of concern for a ruling government is ridiculous. </p>

<p>You know how you stifle government dissent? You kill it at the root, where it begins. All great revolutions have started with nothing more than a spark. Who&#39;s to say the US Government isn&#39;t actively stifling dissent, even be it mundane? especially on websites capable of reaching millions of people.</p>

<p>the posts I made which seemed to be ignored more frequently than others had to do with UN Agenda 21. what is so spammy about Agenda 21? What is so crazy about Agenda 21? </p>

He&#39;s four years younger than me and in the navy. He was in Washington State prior to Bin Laden being killed. He got orders to ship out, and when he did, I send him a message that said &quot;all kidding aside (we don&#39;t get along politically), take care of yourself because i feel like some shit is about to go down&quot;.

I was about to say , Hey Broseph, that&#39;s PRESIDENTObama  to you! WEIRD coincidence !</p>
