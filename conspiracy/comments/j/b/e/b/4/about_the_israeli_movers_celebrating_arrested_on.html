They were seen dancing and celebrating the demise of the of the WTC buildings as they fell. If you&#39;ve seen the pictures of the Israeli art students they took of themselves living in an abandoned section of the trade center you will notice that they are surrounded by hundreds of boxes. What do moving companies have in abundance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that Bush and Cheney used Mossad to conduct 911 because they were more likely to keep it secret than any group of Americans. And most of the &#39;Americans&#39; involved were people who had dual Israeli citizenship. While I blame them I don&#39;t blame the people of Israel who were betrayed by their leaders just as we were betrayed by ours. But I do want to divorce them and stop giving them money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously?  Hell you don&#39;t even have to go back to the Bush administration.  Rahm Emanuel, Obama&#39;s former Chief of Staff, was not only a dual citizen of Israel, but was also an officer in the IDF.  Digest that for a moment... the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, didn&#39;t serve in the US military, but rather was an officer in the Israeli army.</p>

<p>Were you honestly unaware of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it absolutely laughable that the same Israeli apologists who so routinely cite to Wikipedia as their end-all-be-all source, all of a sudden laugh at it when it doesn&#39;t suit their narrative.</p>

<p>Save me the headache of having to cite 3 million sources, as you try to weasel your way out of every one of them.  </p>

<p>Google &quot;Tsahal&quot; and &quot;Rahm Emanuel&quot; and you will find a bevy of information.  Go to town.  Google &quot;Rahm Emanuel&quot; &quot;father&quot; &quot;Benjamin M. Emanuel&quot; and &quot;Irgun&quot;.  Again go to town.  Google &quot;Rahm Emanuel&quot; &quot;Israeli citizen.&quot;  Go to town yet again.</p>

<p>I have neither the patience, nor the tolerance to play this stupid game with you.  Pick and choose which source you value and which you don&#39;t.  If all 3 million of them don&#39;t suit your fancy, then at least your time will be wasted and not mine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, I&#39;ve encountered a few just like that. It&#39;s incredible the lengths they will go to to show Israel and Israeli&#39;s in a positive light.</p>

<p>when I debate Judaism I try to get people to understand the threat they pose to the entire world. no other religion on earth applies such intensity to further their cause than the International Jew. They&#39;re main focus is money, and they get rich at the expense of everyone else. Wealth isn&#39;t created out of thin air, it&#39;s taken from other people. </p>

<p>The most respected members of their communities are often those who have the most money. It&#39;s their entire driving force because it (money) will propagate Judaism, it will buy them political influence, it will buy them entire towns. They have turned acquiring money into a religion in a sense. Money has to be acquired from somewhere, like my pocket...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, most people with dual citizenship don&#39;t reveal it, won&#39;t reveal it and neither does Israel. So you have to judge based on their behavior. But if their loyalty is to Israel over the US, then it doesn&#39;t matter if they obtained dual citizenship or not. Jonathan Pollard and Ariel J. Weinmann didn&#39;t have dual citizenship but they still had more loyalty to Israel than to the US. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s ridiculous how the 9/11 commission doubted their own conclusion but another investigation hasn&#39;t been done, but this particular thing is just a coincidence and the &quot;dancing and celebrating&quot; is only <em>one lady&#39;s story</em> just read the link.</p>

<p>I mean if you really are a &quot;truther&quot; you will search for the truth, which is what I am doing and I found this debunked.</p>

<p>If you read the link I just posted from 911myths.org you will see that this incident is just blown way out of proportion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That hardly debunks these stories. There were actually 3 instances of Israeli nationals being arrested on that day, one with explosives found in their vehicle. They were all deported back to Israel within days.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll track down some sources for you (in fact there was a terrific documentary on this that was really well cited that I would recommend watching, and I&#39;ll edit this post when I find the link). But citing to a website called &quot;911 Myths&quot; isn&#39;t exactly a source I&#39;d rely on to have an aha! moment.  That cite was designed for a purpose.  That&#39;s like citing to the Jerusalem Post to &quot;debunk&quot; a claim made by Palestinians in the West Bank or citing to Fox News to &quot;debunk&quot; something coming out of the White House.</p>

<p>(<strong>Edit</strong>:  Here is the link to the documentary...  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Rys2sense#p/u/17/_d33-Lk5Zbw">http://www.youtube.com/user/Rys2sense#p/u/17/_d33-Lk5Zbw</a>
This documentary does not have the best production value, and the kid in it is a little obnoxious, but it is by far the most informative and plausible explanation I&#39;ve heard yet and it makes a very compelling argument for an Israeli connection.</p>

<p>Warning: it&#39;s long. Like 3 hours long. But this is well worth watching, and it will open your eyes. And don&#39;t trust him at face value-- have a notepad and a pen. Write down what he cites to, and check them out for yourself.
It really is an impressive breakdown.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wouldn&#39;t rely on 911myths.org?? Wow okay so you&#39;re basically saying &quot;screw the other side of the argument, my side is correct and I will only trust things from people on my side&quot; that&#39;s retarded. I look at both sides. Of course the site was made for a purpose. To debunk 911 myths. Am I supposed to ignore everything from sites that debunk 911 myths? There are plenty... I can&#39;t believe you people call yourself &quot;truthers&quot; yet you don&#39;t want to look for the truth. You just want YOUR truth to be true. Well guess what, not EVERY SINGLE THING is part of the inside job that was 9/11. Especially not these idiots in the van that were seen by ONE LADY. <em>more downvotes</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually no, I wouldn&#39;t rely on a source that dismisses an eyewitness account of seeing Israelis dancing in the streets, because they couldn&#39;t find anyone else who saw it.  I suggest you watch the video.  It offers a much more thorough analysis with sources (including 911 recordings, police reports, and multiple news reports including video news reports).  Check the sources.</p>

<p>But to boldly come in here and yell &quot;Debunked!&quot;  While offering what you did is rather silly.  Your source didn&#39;t prove anything.  Did you actually read your source?  Show me how this was &quot;debunked,&quot; because frankly I can&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>The stories it cites to don&#39;t even link to the same incident in some cases.  Did you actually read it and follow the links?  It simply offers the author&#39;s opinion that he didn&#39;t believe what one lady saw, and he gives his own explanation of why the Israelis were taking photographs.  How on earth is that proof of anything?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that <em>if</em> the planes were actually hijacked, it was by a remote connection called Home Run, which all American, and even many foreign jetliners have. it&#39;s basically a system that allows a remote operator to take full control of an airplane, the actual pilot at which point would have no control. i think it&#39;s likely that there wasn&#39;t actually people in the planes, the flight rosters were phony, the phone calls that were supposedly from victims on board phony, and that the planes themselves may have actually been military planes painted to look like commercial jetliners. it&#39;s very likely that what hit the Pentagon was a cruise missile, also painted to look like a commercial jetliner.</p>

<p>i think the entire thing was orchestrated by, George Tenet, George Bush, Dick Cheny, David Rockefeller, other US intelligence sources, some unknown Washington Zionist insiders, and MOSSAD. i think it was MOSSAD that wired the buildings with explosives in the weeks leading up to 9/11. imo the motive was in excess of $20 trillion dollars (Iraq and Afghanistan) to be split amongst the 7 Sisters of big oil, and the major defense contractors...</p>

<p>And why would they have an empty plane flown by remote, when they&#39;re killing all the people in the building anyway? - that&#39;s actually a dumb question, think about it. in the airplane you would have to have the cooperation of a cabin full of victims, where as the people in the buildings never had a choice. besides, it was easier to create the victims out of thin air...</p>

<p>Jet fuel doesn&#39;t burn hot enough to bring down steel buildings</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>That&#39;s a common troofer lie.</strong></p>

<p>The jet fuel only got the fires burning, but it was a massive start.  Other building materials kept it going.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the important bit:  The fires weren&#39;t hot enough to melt steel.  But they <strong>were</strong> plenty hot enough for the steel to lose half it&#39;s structural strength.  Combined to other massive damage to the buildings, and its no surprise that they collapsed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thousands of architects and engineers that are screaming bloody murder </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Thats&#39; another troofer lie.</strong></p>

<p>Signing a petition callng for a better investigation is NOT the same as believing in a fantasy government conspiracy to drop the buildings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>first steel buildings in history to fall due to fires</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>And... another troofer lie.</strong></p>

<p>In all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever been hit with a plane traveling 500 miles an hour and had its fire proofing removed from its trusses.</p>

<p>In all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever had its steel columns which hold lateral load sheared off by a 767.</p>

<p>In all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever been a building which had its vertical load bearing columns in its core removed by an airliner.</p>

<p>For Building 7, in all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever been left for 6-7 hours with its bottom floors on fire with structural damage from another building collapse. </p>

<p>Most of the buildings the nutjobs point to are steel reinforced concrete buildings or have steel reinforced concrete cores. Others are constructed with a steel web evenly distributed throughout the building. These buildings are not a &quot;tube in a tube&quot; design. The WTC towers were steel without concrete. The towers perimeter steel walls were held in place by the trusses and those trusses were connected to the perimeter columns by small bolts.</p>

<p>In addition I REMEMBER the fire at the Interstate Bank Building in Los Angeles. It made the news here in Winnipeg - during the fire - because of fears that it would collapse. They actually had a time limit that the building was rated for - how many minutes it was guarenteed to withstand a fire before the columns weakened to the point of collapse.</p>

<p>The 1991 One Meridian Plaza fire in Philadelphia was the same story. Firefighters evacuated the building when a pancake structural collapse was considered likely.</p>

<p>&quot;All interior firefighting efforts were halted after almost 11 hours of uninterrupted fire in the building. Consultation with a structural engineer and structural damage observed by units operating in the building led to the belief that there was a possibility of a pancake structural collapse of the fire damaged floors.&quot;</p>

<p>And finally, the more one looks into your troofer claim, the more one finds out that it&#39;s an outright lie:</p>

<p>In 1997 three four story buildings at the Kader Toy Factoy in Singapore caught fire. All three collapsed from fire alone in under three hours.</p>

<p>The steel framed McCormick Center was at the time the World&#39;s largest exhibition center. It like the WTC used long steel trusses to create a large open space without columns. In 1976 it collapsed only 30 minutes after the start of a small electrical fire.</p>

<p>In 1997 the Sight and Sound Theater in Strasburg, Pennsylvania collapsed during a fire. It too used a rigid steel-frame construction.</p>

<p>The Delft University of Technology, Architecture School collapsed in a pancake reaction to a fire. (<a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/06/hey_911_truthers_is_this_a_con.html">citation</a>)</p>

<p>&quot;Let me repeat that .... the School Of Architecture. I&#39;m highly doubtful they built a deficient building for themselves. Steel frame high rise building collapses and is utterly destroyed by a fire begun by a shorted out coffee pot.&quot;</p>

There is overwhelming evidence against you and yet you still desperately cling onto this being a conspiracy theory.  I mean calling him out as a shill?  Jesus christ man, you should get some help..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said &quot;most protected building on earth.&quot;  You&#39;re moving the goal posts.</p>

<p>As for your obvious &quot;false flag&quot; angle, WHY AFGHANISTAN?  There&#39;s nothing there worth taking!  Even the &quot;Oil pipeline!  Oil pileline!!!&quot; claim is for an unlikely oil pipeline to deliver someone else&#39;s oil to INDIA.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that Bush II and his co-conspirators planned to invade Iraq right from day one of his presidency.  And the House of Saud are Bush family friends.  SO, why did a false flag operation not implicate Saddam?  Why it they use Saudi hijackers?  Why the pointless excursion into Afghanistan?  The 9/11 false flag claim has never made sense.</p>

<p>As for being an anti-truth tool, <strong>that would be YOU</strong>.</p>

<p>If there were any truth to - for example - the truther conspiracies, <strong>YOU</strong> are the one discrediting them.  <strong>YOU</strong> are the one painting them as anti-semetic, hopelessly dishonest, wingnutty submorons.</p>

<p>I can think of a number of aspects of 9/11 that <strong>REQUIRE</strong> much deeper investigation.  I can even think of a government cover-up theory FAR more believable than ANYTHING I&#39;ve seen from the troofers.</p>

<p>All YOU do is mindlessly parrot an endless barrage of long disproven troofer lies, the kind that serve only to suppress anyone with legitimate concerns, for fear of being grouped in with that movement of dishonest wingnuts.  And that&#39;s when you&#39;re not in flaming-nazi-wannabe mode.</p>

<p>How much do <strong>YOU</strong> get paid?</p>

<p>Oh, and the Trans-Afghan pipeline, and opium production, are the main agenda in Afghanistan. US companies own $14 trillion dollars worth of oil and natural gas in the regions north of Afghanistan. The Trans-Afghan Pipeline will carry that oil and natural gas through Pakistan to a sea port... </p>

<p>&quot;This war served US geopolitical ambitions and maintained an American sphere of influence in the region. The CIA operated in the region through Pakistan’s military intelligence, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which is still operational and highly controversial today. Through the ISI, the CIA financed and armed the Mujahideen via manufacturing and exporting heroin.[2]&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enron in Afghanistan</p>

<p>In December of 1998, Unocal announced that it quit its Afghan pipeline project.[12] Between 1996 and 2001, Enron bosses had given millions of dollars in bribes to Taliban officials to secure contracts for building pipelines. After Unocal withdrew from the deal, Enron continued to pressure the Taliban to continue with a pipeline. In 1996, neighboring Uzbekistan signed a deal with Enron to develop Uzbek natural gas fields.[13] On December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy. &quot;</p>
