    <div class="md"><p>Im in Manhattan, and I didn&#39;t notice but a picture on my wall was crooked.  I just think this bizarre weather that has become the norm, coupled with the earthquakes getting more and more frequent, and the super-weirdo tornadoes that hunt down neighborhoods are starting to be a little too much for Black Rage to handle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean.</p>

<p>As far as the earthquake go&#39;s, I live in PA, and I felt it very strongly. My entire house was shaking like crazy. Though my house wasn&#39;t built right, and is missing some of the most essential structural components, like proper cross bracing in the floor joists.</p>

<p>If you watch live weather radar you will notice some very strange anomalies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years back a Level 4 Biohazard containment building - the National Virology Lab in Winnipeg - was built a few blocks from my house.  I passed it on the way to work every morning.  It was the first to sequence the genes for SARS and H1N1, and to create a vaccine for Ebola.</p>

<p>A couple months later I had to take a detour, because the area around the lab was being evacuated.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the evacuation was because the battery business across the street had spilled some acid.  This could give off some nasty gases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you follow the money...real money that is (gold), it goes back to the private owners of the federal reserve bank.  these are the same people who are holding the western world hostage for interest payments, and it has been discovered by the rest of the world (Predominantly BRIC or developing countries) that the western world is run by a bunch of money changing oligarchs.  Hugo Chavez recently demanded the Bank of England deliver Venezuela&#39;s 211 tons of gold.  This is much more significant than you&#39;d be lead to believe...It is the beginning of the fall of the house of cards that is the petro dollar hegemony.  The ponzi scheme they have created runs out when they run out of people to continually buy their debt (since the ultimate collateral, gold, has been overpromised/overleased).  Since the industrialization of the US is gone, bargaining chips for new debt purchasers have dwindled...and they have resorted to threats.  Since it would be an overt act of war to threaten with a bomb...a more covert weapon (earthquake or weather manipulation) can be used to forcibly coerce a country to continue to purchase debt.  Such was the case in Japan, during their earthquake which forced Japan to intervene by printing billions and billions of yen.</p>

<p>My evidence of desperation on the part of the federal reserve requires a lot of financial context to paint the picture, but if you follow experts such as Jim Rickards, Jim Sinclair, Peter Schiff, Jim Rogers and others - you&#39;d know that the Federal Reserve has no other option any longer than to print money to purchase sovereign debt issuance.  This is why they announced interest rates will be at 0-.25 % for the next 2 years.  Not only that, but they may well be purchasing the stock market to keep the nominal prices artificially high - AND they have been providing secret liquidity to banks since the end of JULY despite not announcing more quantitative easing.</p>

<p>Take all of these factors into consideration when you&#39;ve seen all the horrid weather manipulation documented by dutchsinse and the CLEAR acts of deception and theater by this administration to kick the can down the road and it is not hard to make the assertion that financial desperation could lead to or incite the powers that be to engage in meteorological acts of mass destruction.  Just my take on things!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the power to counterfeit money rests in the confidence of that particular institution to manage monetary policy - and that confidence is waning fast...A natural disaster has an immediate and observable effect on the demand for currency.  People sell stocks, or assets to purchase food, repair their house, or rebuild their business.  Insurance companies have to shell out dollars, which also increases demand for the paper currency.  It&#39;s a sure-fire way to take attention off of the failing petro dollar reserve currency status which is currently on the brink of failing and temporarily forcing people to seek &quot;safe haven&quot; in greenbacks.  This is also known as kicking the can down the road.</p>

<p>To answer more specifically it is not economically beneficial...It is politically beneficial for those in power and economically advantageous when you are the beneficiary of the power to counterfeit.</p>
