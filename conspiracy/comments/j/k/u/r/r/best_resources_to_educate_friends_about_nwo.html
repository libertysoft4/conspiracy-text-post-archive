I&#39;d like to be able to point them to one or two resources to help them get the bigger picture.  Everything that I know now has been picked up from visiting many different sites, youtube videos, etc.  Are there any sites out there that do a good job of providing a &quot;beginners guide&quot; to help wake people up about these issues?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGk5ioEXlIM">American Dream</a> is a half hour long adult cartoon. Gives a good base overview of the banking aspect.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTIFmcE8ZjY">FLIR 911</a> demonstrates the science that proves the planes did not <strong>cause</strong> the collapse of the twin towers. Point out to them that she had to walk to there through a metal fatiguing fire. Also look up the &quot;Empire state building struck by plane&quot; (1961 I think)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVR6_7BNyEI&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded">U.S.S. Liberty</a> Most people never heard about this. And it shows what they will do to us to get their way. Also goes along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a> Declassified.</p>

<p><a href="http://farmageddonmovie.com/">Farmagedon</a> shows how these groups are systematically exterminating and genetically altering humans. They are doing the same with pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p><a href="http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;amp;aid=25080">8 families rule the world</a> shows who these elite of elite are and how they own the controlling power. These are members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group#Conspiracy_theories">Bilderburg Group</a> They did not have a name yet but even <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Military-Industrial_Complex_Speech">Eisenhower talked</a> about them and his concerns. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KeR3yMZi0g">JFK</a> asked us to help him go after them. And was going to start proceedings to root them out, after his Dallas stop.</p>

<p>This group is so crafty at what they do they even twist our sacred things to advantage them. The Pledge of Allegiance was changed the around the same time as the Military Industrial Complex. Where we then became divisible &quot;under God&quot;. Through this small twist they accomplished 2 things: </p>

<p>*They made atheists upset about having to say they believe in something they dont = division</p>

<p>*They got it removed from schools, I&#39;ll let <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZBTyTWOZCM">Red Skeleton explain</a></p>

<p>Also on this I am concerned which &quot;God&quot; the original author intended. Looking at our country ever since then it looks like its under the <em>God of War</em> then any Christ type.</p>

<p>And this group has such a thorough plan they even etched their rules for <strong>after</strong> they win and gain complete control in granite. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">The Georgia Guidestones</a> some call it a joke, but in 1979 a half million dollars wasnt a joke to these people. In the 90&#39;s maybe, but NOT back then. The &quot;rules&quot; dont sound bad until every one of them is about controlling people like slaves, even the &quot;Balance personal rights with social duties&quot; means that if you feed the slaves you get to travel to the kitchen. If your a slave owner you can travel farther. If your one of the 8 families you can go wherever whenever you want. Guess what the regular slaves get? (oh dont forget this calls for 6.5 BILLION people to be ... gone... rule 1)</p>

<p>These are some of the links I have and use regularly. If you have 5 hours there is a VERY in-depth documentary about the Royal families and shows A LOT of information called the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w-A54h_GQ8">&quot;Ring of Power&quot;</a></p>

<p>Video from 1958 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yieQ3u0eSY&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded">Robert Welch</a> gave 2 speeches the first is to a private audience and the second is to the entire attendees.</p>

<p>And as soon as Montreal 2010 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4AyOk9P4wU&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded">Zbigniew Brzezinski</a> admitted to the awakening disrupting their agenda.</p>

<p>And go the next step and listen to what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGGmczY_WhA&amp;amp;feature=related">Anonymous has to say about them</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shock doctrine. The war on democracy, I think the best way to get through to people is focus on things that are provable and don&#39;t sound crazy. Eg. Best arguement for 911.....there was molten metal up to 3000+ degrees under wtc even weeks after 911. Show infared images, pics, videos showing this. Now explain to them hydrocarbons only burn as hot as 1500-1800 degrees. Proving this should be easy. So it&#39;s impossible for steel to have melted then without a catalyst. Case closed......that&#39;s impossible to refute. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought Zeitgeist: addendum and Invisible Empire were good films about the NWO. But the best film about corrupt banking is called The Money Masters. It&#39;s long and has some dull parts, but it&#39;s truly educational on how the banking system got started and where it is up until 1995. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Documentaries - If you can get someone to sit down for an hour and a half and pay attention to any of the plethora of documentaries out there, they will come out of it knowing a lot more.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some of my suggestions:</p>

<p>Invisible Empire - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO24XmP1c5E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO24XmP1c5E</a>  </p>

<p>The Obama Deception - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaQNACwaLw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaQNACwaLw</a>  </p>

<p>Endgame - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-CrNlilZho">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-CrNlilZho</a>  </p>

<p>AMERICA: Freedom To Fascism - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orHVNUnRKlI&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orHVNUnRKlI&amp;amp;feature=related</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, my advice is: READ BOOKS. Reading things on the internet while stimulating and interesting is much more of a surface glance on the subject than reading some literature based on factual evidence. Plus if you tell the person you&#39;re talking to that you read it in a book rather than on the internet it sounds more credible.</p>

<p>Onto rec&#39;s: I highly recommend you read Antony Suttons Wall Street and FDR/Hitler/USSR books.</p>

<p>Aside from books, read the site Zerohedge. Steep learning curve, but you will learn</p>

<p>Edit: It&#39;s easy to watch movies, but once you start arguing with someone, you realize you don&#39;t have specific sources on hand and your argument falls to shit. I consider literature to be &quot;battle-ready&quot; knowledge, whereas video&#39;s, however truthful they may be, should be thought of more as entertainment and thought-provocation</p>
