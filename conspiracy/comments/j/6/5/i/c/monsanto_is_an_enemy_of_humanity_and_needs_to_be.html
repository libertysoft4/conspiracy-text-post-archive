<p>Check them out, look at the information for yourself, and spread the word.</p>

<p>Without more people being aware of the dangers of GMOs and Monsanto, we will soon not be able to eat non-GMO food as everything will be contaminated with their patented genetic structures.</p>

<p>Post other good articles that actually cite scientific research in the comments. It is important that we only spread articles that cite irrefutable, rigorous research. This isn&#39;t ideological, this is a matter of fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food Inc is a great documentary that talks about this. Monsanto has bought up and patented so much seed it&#39;s fucking ridiculous. We use to have hundreds of strains of all of our crops developed freely by Agg students/professors in public seed repositories. Monsanto has patented almost all of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all due to that fucking GE Supreme Court decision too because they wanted to patent oil eating bacteria and the Patent Office had a strict &quot;You can&#39;t patent life&quot; policy. GE never even used their fucking bacteria after they won because it ended up destroying the environment and was useless in oil spills. </p>

<p>Now we have very few strains of our majors crops...and if some disease comes and wipes a strain out, who has all the others that will be resistant? Yep, Monsanto... the company that got the court to rule farmers are responsible for preventing the wind from cross-contaminating their crops </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I typically only creep this sub reddit because most of the posts are speculative tripe, but I have to say I nearly wholeheartedly agree with the OP&#39;s sentiment against Monsanto. </p>

<p>I do have one difference of opinion regarding GMOs, but&#39;s more of a general opinion. Basically, I think GMOs are actually a <strong>huge</strong> benefit for consumers and the food industry because they allow more food to be grown in less space. But Monsanto had to go fuck this up too and what could have been a sustainable project of agricultural science has turned into the food-industry&#39;s equivalent of patent-trolling. I am mainly referring to terminator seeds — specially modified plants with only one generation. There is no energy benefit to these seeds — and when term-seed crop happens to produce seeds, farmers may not harvest them. </p>

<p>TLDR: GMOs would help humanity if it weren&#39;t for the greedy actions of Monsanto and other Agricultural conglomerates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And my emphasis is on <strong>they</strong>. For the most part, GMOs are used to increase food production.
