    <div class="md"><p>A few years back there was a BBC interview with Benazir Bhutto who was at that time, I believe running for president of Pakistan.  She stated that there were threats on her life.  When asked who was issuing these threats, she stated very clearly that the people who murdered Osama bin Laden were after her too.  As you may recall she was killed in a motorcade by an assassin.  The interview that was eventually aired removed her reference to bin Laden.  The whole interview can still be found on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is <em>no</em> objective evidence of his death. </p>

<p>The government&#39;s story changed some 4 or 5 times in the first 24 hours.  </p>

<p>The faked picture of Obama and Hillary and Co watching the attack. I particularly like Hillary&#39;s look of shock, that was later explained as a sneeze when it was revealed that it would have been impossible for anyone to actually watch the attack inside the building.</p>

<p>The helicopter crash is still a big WTF to me. </p>

<p>No interviews (even distorted to hide identity) with the alleged attack team.</p>

<p>They shot Bin Laden for no apparent reason. </p>

<p>All we have is the government&#39;s <em>appeal to authority</em> about the attack. Sorry, but logical fallacies do not impress me as &quot;proof&quot; of <em>anything</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone feel like they&#39;re in a weird Orwellian time?  I can&#39;t believe people reacted to this by getting wasted and cheering for his assassination.  1. No evidence that we actually killed him 2. The story repeatedly changed and sounded absurd to being with and 3. We executed OBL while he was unarmed.  What happened to a trial and the rule of law? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If, indeed, Bin Laden was killed in the supposed Bin Laden compound in Pakistan, it was certainly murder by any judgement. The guy was begging for his life, unarmed, with his hands in the air, at the time he was shot to death. Bin Laden has been accused of various crimes, but have any crimes ever been proved against him in a court of law, while he was present to face and respond to his accusers? I don&#39;t think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on this one. The <em>only</em> person to speak coherently about this was Ron Paul. He, too, questioned an extrajudicial killing solely on the order of the president. I&#39;ve no doubt its happened hundreds of times in the past, but at least they had the good manners to keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>Now they celebrate it. There&#39;s <em>nothing</em> to stop it from being you or me the next time.</p>

<p>if you were listening to the propaganda on NPR today, please say so.</p>

<p>what i tell you 3 times is true. its nueral linguistic programming on the population to make them trust what the authorities are saying. </p>

<p>this is kind of like a ninja 9/11 in a way.. it has created a cognitave dissonance in society. 80% believe that 9/11 was an attack on america from outside forces, 80% believe that bin laden was killed in some raid by a secret seal team that crashes helicopters</p>

<p>and thats the way it will be. history written by the victors. no one cares about 9/11 anymore/.  the books will leave out norad standing down / wtc7/ etc </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m disgusted with the total disconnect in American society.  Within hours of the attacks, it was announced that Osama/al Qaeda were responsible, and with <em>no proof or evidence</em> the American public ate it up and gave Washington their unwavering support..... and off we went to start trillion-dollar wars in the name of proactively fighting terror.  Yet anybody who comes along with a conflicting account of what happened gets ridiculed because they don&#39;t have &quot;solid evidence&quot; that it was a conspiracy.  All of a sudden, these same people who had no problem believing the official story without solid evidence now demand evidence before even considering that it was all a lie.  Hypocrisy at its finest.</p>

<p>His &quot;involvement&quot; in 9/11 was a lie, and his &quot;death&quot; at the hands of a SEAL team was a lie as well.  <strong>In my opinion</strong>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people ask me for my evidence that 9/11 was an inside job, I simply ask them what proof they have of the government&#39;s story. </p>

<p>No pictures of them at the airport. They weren&#39;t even on the passenger list, for christ&#39;s sake. no DNA evidence of any of the 19, although they said they found DNA evidence of <em>every</em> victim. No airplane parts linked back to the supposed flights. The government&#39;s had to admit that American Airlines didn&#39;t have in-flight phones in 2001, and making cell phone calls from 10,000 feet at 500 miles an hour is entirely impossible.</p>

<p>You have to be willfully ignorant to believe that story these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I think is, I don&#39;t know if Bin Laden was killed in the compound by Obama&#39;s hit squad, or if he had already been dead for years.</p>

<p>Either way, the whole operation to attack the Bin Laden compound stinks to high heaven. Why no video of Bin Laden being murdered by American troops? Why the crazy decision to &quot;bury&quot; his corpse in the ocean, before it could be independently identified? Why no independent DNA tests? Why no public report on the autopsy, if indeed any autopsy was ever even done on the corpse?</p>

<p>When you come down to it, we have no way of knowing that there ever was a corpse. I&#39;m assuming somebody got murdered that night, while begging for his life with his hands in the air, but was it Bin Laden or some poor, innocent dupe? How can we know, when Obama and his grisly crew concealed all the evidence?</p>

<p>Are we supposed to just trust the government account? Sorry, the government account is nuts. And besides, I stopped trusting the US government a long time ago. Too many lies.</p>

<li>No video? This isnt rome. We arent supposed to enjoy watching people die. Civilized and all that</li>
<li>sea burial? I&#39;ve got nothing. im guessing they were posing with the body and it fell overboard.</li>
<li>DNA? who cares.</li>
</ol>

<p>But i agree. It sounds fishy. Be advised though there was a shoot on sight order given to all military personell in regards to osama.</p>

He spouted hateful violent rhetoric and he had a lot of money, but then again so does Pat Robertson and he hasn&#39;t been called out as a terrorist yet.

<p>He denied any responsibility for 9/11.  Was never officially charged with any crimes around the attack.  And we&#39;re left to believe that 200 &quot;Al Quaeda&quot; operatives warrant TRILLIONS of dollars to fight.  War is a sham.  Terrorism is a sham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If, indeed, Bin Laden was killed in the supposed Bin Laden compound in Pakistan, it was certainly murder by any judgement. The guy was begging for his life, unarmed, with his hands in the air, at the time he was shot to death. Bin Laden has been accused of various crimes, but have any crimes ever been proved against him in a court of law, while he was present to face and respond to his accusers? I don&#39;t think so.</p>

He, too, questioned an extrajudicial killing solely on the order of the president.

<p>Now they celebrate it. There&#39;s <em>nothing</em> to stop it from being you or me the next time.</p>
