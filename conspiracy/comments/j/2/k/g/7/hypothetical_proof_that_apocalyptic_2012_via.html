Our planet is already stretched to its limit as it is (relevant:<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1176980-2,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1176980-2,00.html</a>) and the Comet&#39;s gravitational pull on the ocean much like the moon&#39;s is bound to be near &#39;apocalyptic&#39; as far as flooding.

    <div class="md"><p>Comets don&#39;t have enough mass to effect planetary bodies gravitationally, though they may, and probably do, carry immense electrical charges which are a significant threat in their own right if the comet gets close to anything. There is a theory that many of what we have been thinking are impact craters around the solar system may in fact be points of discharge between heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>Elenin may not be a comet, however. It should be off-gassing prodigiously by now, and it&#39;s not. That means it&#39;s not a dirty snowball, and is in fact made of something denser. How dense is not known, so gravitational effects are still a possibility. An object 4000km across that was somehow the same density as a brown dwarf star would still rock our world significantly at the distance it will pass while still near the ecliptic. That something is orbiting such a small object suggests an extraordinary density, and also has the implication of enough gravity that substantial debris is being towed along behind for Earth to encounter when it passes behind Elenin toward the end of October.</p>

<p>According to Brooks Agnew, an expert on tomography, it has too many angular surfaces to be an ordinary space object, and chances are fairly decent it&#39;s an artifact or technology of some kind.</p>

<p>Just as an aside; the Sumerians claimed the most distant body orbiting the brown dwarf is in fact a very small planet made mostly of iron which the Annunaki use as a weapon, and which they call the destroyer; it is this object which is responsible for the rain of fire and meteors that precedes the crossing of the dark star.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm <a href="http://www.spaceobs.org">spaceobs</a> is down and other conspiracy sites are buzzing about it. </p>

<p>I found this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVEfHW5-cR0&amp;amp;feature=related">video</a> from May. Which references spaceobs.org and he does some math to show that Elenin, is going to appear to Earth as a mini moon sized comet.</p>

<p>Not sure about this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBkuu-Tck6E&amp;amp;feature=related">video</a> but it is interesting. Extinction Level Event Nibiru Is Near he says.</p>

<p>Consider the Hopi story of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y1GdKdNhY4">Red/Blue Kachinas</a>. It has the possibility of zombies and dinosaurs, which would be fucking awesome.</p>

<p><a href="/b24" title="Just you wait, Twilight. You&#39;re gonna learn that some pony tales really are true."></a></p>

<p>Edit: Random internet site <a href="http://sydneystargazers.com/2011/05/28/28th-may-2011-notes-comet-elenin-coma-now-at-100000km/">1</a> <a href="http://alamongordo.com/mysteries/elenin-information-page/">2</a></p>

<p>site 1 is more recent saying the coma is growing in size and makes a prediction.
site 2 refers to the info that was on spaceobs and adds the same numbers from site 1.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2010_X1#cite_note-Coma-May-7">Wikipedia</a> now has this same info referencing spaceobs.org, which is still down.</p>

<p>What is cool about astronomy, is that it is available to everyone. Problem is, us northern hemisphere dwellers would not really be able to get a <a href="http://www.curtrenz.com/comets02.html">good look</a> until October anyways, unless of course you had access to space telescopes like Hubble or SOHO</p>

<p>Just for hypothetical fun, I made <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dGQUd.png">this image</a> to try and estimate what this might look like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a matter of scale. Gravity decreases with the square of the distance.</p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<p><em>The gravitational attraction force between two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them from their center.</em></p>

<p>What this means in practice is that as the distance between two gravitational bodies increases, the strength of attraction between them drops off precipitiously. To cause any gravitational effects on the Earth, the body would need to be truly massive, or would need to pass extremely close. But if it is a small body, such as a comet, even if it kissed the surface of the Earth it would not be close enough to its center to actually produce any significant gravitational effect (the Earth is 4,000 miles in radius).</p>

<p>For this astronomical body to be a threat, it would need to be MASSIVE, and it would need to pass very close to the Earth. Both. One or the other isn&#39;t going to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repenter is right. The comet will have the mass of half the moon and pass at exactly the right point to not only have a pull stronger than that of the moon but enough to counteract the effect the moon already has. This will tip the precarious line of ecological dominoes over and there will be a negative result. More than likely caused by &quot;them&quot; and their hidden agenda to keep America, nay, the world in the dark about the apocalypse. It&#39;s all in the murals at Denver international!!!!!!!!!</p>
