    <div class="md"><p>I have stated before that I was an active protester of the bush wars (before and during, I was arrested multiple times for sit-ins and roadblocks, all nonviolent). the war in libya reminds me of soviet shit in their former westward territories, but it&#39;s proximity to europe is unsettling, also that it was one of the few secular arabic/african governments in a majority islamic region, the whole deal just sounds fucked to me, total resource grab.</p>

<p>the fact that the &quot;progressives&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot; are okay with black man obama bombing libya and killing osama makes my fucking head spin, the people that i thought stood beside me back in the bush days today are hollow shells, it&#39;s like talking to a fucking wall. idiotic.</p>

<p>but yeah, calling bombing runs kinetic actions instead of war while arming the terrorist groups that will one day set their sights on america for the sake of cheap oil for europe in exchange for favorable dealings when it comes to americas fiat currency dominance sort of pisses me off, especially when people pretend it&#39;s for &quot;humanitarian&quot; reasons, have you fuckwits not understood 1984? shit, I read that in middle school. it&#39;s issues like these that i realise how truly dominated the american public is by utter fucking big lie bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m ashamed to be an American. They have killed the Libyan people, taken their country, at the orders of the oil companies because Gaddafi threatened to increase the royalties they paid and give all the money to the Libyan people. Also Libya was a socialist republic and the global plutocracy can&#39;t allow any system that doesn&#39;t enrich them. If I was young I would move, but move where? The plutocracy controls the world now, doing evil everywhere, dictating terms, driving the working people back into the dust. We are all screwed. </p>

<p>And don&#39;t tell me Gaddafi and Libya were repressive. They were nothing compared to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and other dictatorships around the world. The capitalist plutocracy allows/encourages any kind of repression as long as their puppet rulers can be used to grind down their people so they, the global capitalists, can steal their resources. </p>

<p>And now, with the American people no longer buying &quot;terrorism&quot; in large enough numbers, they are resurrecting the Soviet Union, despite it being long deceased, because they must always have an enemy and they can conjure one up from the dead as easy as make up one from the living. </p>

<p>I am ashamed of the American people, ashamed of Obama (who I will NEVER vote for again), ashamed of myself. </p>

<p>Ya ever think about Obama. He was born and bred by the plutocracy, his father brought over from Africa so he wouldn&#39;t be politically active there, married to a CIA agent/asset, then when Barry was born he was raised and trained by the CIA and Rockefeller interests to know how to tell the right lies, and do whatever evil he was told to. He is as much a puppet as any tin-horned dictator controlled by foreign capitalists. </p>

I don&#39;t remember how we got on the topic of actual news as opposed to their training of boyfriends (<em>facepalm</em>) but I explained in very brief detail what they had mentioned and the immediate response was &quot;oh, no debby downer bullshit&quot; and that was it. I just sat in silence for a long time thinking about how common that reaction is.</p>

<p>If the masses know what&#39;s going on, they try to ignore it as much as possible.</p>

<p>That&#39;s really the objective of propaganda. You use it initially, whether it&#39;s directly about the issue at hand, or whether it is all the preliminary and external stuff that sets up the kind of worldview you want your target audience to have and keeps them distracted, so that they&#39;re practically self-regulating.</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly propagandists on the internet, particularly on reddit which has proven itself to be a powerful entity for social change (the rally to restore sanity on its own should be evidence of it&#39;s power - even if the rally hasn&#39;t made a clearly observable difference, just being able to muster that many people is significant), so it would be batshit insane and willfully stupid NOT to have people on here trying to influence readers. And it&#39;s likely propagandists from all sorts of organizations with an interest in manipulating people. You have marketers on here for sure, and several of them have been outed or have outed themselves. But they&#39;re really only needed to tweak and prod and adjust and regularly maintain a particular concept or theme because good propagandists make the target audience self-regulating to minimize the amount of work needed (among other reasons).</p>

<p>It&#39;s so disheartening; you know if you voice your concerns or suspicions, people will marginalize you into oblivion once it&#39;s clear it&#39;s going against the popular fantasy.  I suppose that&#39;s just how life works, but it sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sucks, and it is <em>one</em> way that life can work. There are ways to achieve your goals and circumvent the propaganda techniques. It just requires a little more thought. Most importantly is to have the facts on your side. Facts and logic. Evidence. Strong arguments. Even if the people living in a fantasy world can&#39;t hear them or aren&#39;t able to hold them in mind, there are methods of dissociating them from the brainwashing/hypnosis/propaganda just long enough to get the point across. But you&#39;ve got to do it right, and you&#39;ve got to be professional about it as far as PR/personal-image stuff goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was prepared to reluctantly vote for him again; partially because he scares me less than say... Michelle Bachman, partially in the hope that as a lame duck he&#39;d be more willing to take the gloves off and force a few things.  Honestly, I still think that as a person, he is (was) sincere about wanting to improve the US for everyone.  Honestly, I still think that he had NO idea what he was getting into.  And though I knew ahead of time that they were probably going to make him just as much a tool of the corporate interests as the last guy, I hoped he&#39;d be able to fight against it.  But he surrounded himself with sharks and is at the mercy of whatever they feed him, and buys into the illusion that&#39;s force fed to the rest of us about how America is so great, and of course we&#39;re not going to do anything to other countries that&#39;s not completely justified!  But now... I&#39;m having a hard time telling whether he&#39;s been corrupted by the position or if he&#39;s just a LOT more gullible than I originally thought he was.</p>

<p>I still think he is (was?) a good man and that he honestly wanted and tried to do what&#39;s right. But whether he&#39;s being duped, used, manipulated, or just has been changed by the fact of being President, at this point I feel sorry for <em>him</em> that we elected him and put him in that position.  And he&#39;s going to serve as the human shield for all the hatred and anger because of all that&#39;s going on so that everyone can feel justified in voting for someone else next time, who will serve the same purpose.  He was my one remaining glimmer of faith in the election process, but I guess I&#39;ll just stay home from now on.  It doesn&#39;t matter who wins, and it probably never did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chillax, bro. I already said I&#39;m not voting for him again, I was just illustrating <em>why</em> I thought there might be hope for something decent to happen with this one.  Clearly, I was mistaken.  Not about his character, but about his ability to shake up the structure.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure your comparison is accurate there though.  Unless the boss in that scenario is the manager who hired the employee, then stood by while he continually kept getting screwed by the board of directors who effectively prevented him from doing his job, then the boss fired him for incompetence.</p>

<p>tl;dr I think the defect is not with Obama himself (at least I didn&#39;t think so originally; now I&#39;m not as positive as I was) but that anyone being put in that job is subject to the same shit.  His biggest problem is thinking the people advising (read: &#39;controlling&#39;) him have either his or our best interests in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of those countries are staging coups. None of the media organizations are referring to the troops as &quot;NATO troops&quot; or &quot;US troops,&quot; they are rebels. This is a civil war being staged by the populace.  The reason NATO started fighting in Libya is because Gaddafi announced a <em>cease fire</em> and then <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42164455/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/?gt1=43001#.TlJcJai2qa4">broke it</a> against <em>his own citizens</em> when his troops started trying to take Benghazi. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;we used to be cool with him,&quot; it&#39;s a matter of protecting civilians. All NATO targets have been military installations such as tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and other structures.</p>

<p>There have also been uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Kuwait, and Lebanon. In every case, I support the <em>people&#39;s rule,</em> not a single head of state.</p>

<p>Gadaffi is a ruler whose own people call for his head on a stake and he stills vows not to relinquish command. This is democracy in action - the citizens of Libya are pulling one of <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/">these</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the west does not have the resources to invade every dictatorship and I do not know how practical those interventions would be, but they likely would not be as simple as airstrikes and naval blockades supporting a popular uprising. </p>

<p>Regardless and this may sound unfortunate but, does it matter why the west is intervening if it does in fact mean greater freedom for Libya? This was not started by the west after all.</p>

<p>If your problem is with the exploitation of oil reserves why not protest that directly rather than presuming to speak for the people of Libya?</p>

<p>Tell me, if you lived in Libya would you honestly prefer to live under Qaddafi?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libya&#39;s has(had) free health care and education for the people and subsidized housing.  Education was completely free in Libya. Libyans could study at home or abroad and the government gives them a monthly stipend while they are in school and they pay no tuition. If a Libyan needs a surgery that must be done overseas, then the government will pay for that surgery. Libyans were given a small sum of money on a yearly basis, usually  around the equivalent of $500 U.S. dollars. The Libyan government had NO national debt. If you want to get to the real reason for the war. Do some research on how Qadaffi was making the move to have the Libyan Dinar take the place of the U.S. dollar as main trading currency in Africa and throughout the Middle East.

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of facts that support the conclusion that Col. Gaddhafi improved the quality of life for the Libyan people 100-fold.  They have free education now. Free health care. No homeless population - all Libyan families (with the exception of the nomadic Bedouin) have a home, and I believe most also have a car.  The literacy rate is now somewhere around 86% compared to around 20% before he took over.  He brought water into the desert with a huge irrigation effort. and provides anyone who wishes to be a farmer with land, equipment, and seeds.  He nationalized the oil, and every Libyan citizen gets a percentage of the sale of the country&#39;s oil.  He&#39;s been working on behalf of Africa to help the African nations unite, pool their resources and become a world power instead of so often being dependent on foreign aid and colonialist policies.  All the money from Libya&#39;s oil reserves is invested in building Libya and Africa and improving the quality of life for the people.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not sitting around in gold-dripping palaces.  He lives in compounds and tents, for pete&#39;s sake.  Is he perfect? No. But these are the actions of a man who has spent the past 40 years trying to do right on behalf of Libya, and succeeding in many ways.  This whole &#39;brutal, oppressive dictator&#39; thing is a huge stretch.</p>

<p>His humanitarian record may not be perfect, but neither is the US&#39;s, and quite frankly, the population of Libya have been enjoying benefits that US citizens would kill to have.  They have free education.  We&#39;re locking people up for enrolling their children in the &#39;wrong&#39; school.  They have free health care, and if they do not have the capacity to perform a necessary procedure for a citizen, he/she will be flown out to another country to have it done and paid for.  The crime rate is virtually nonexistent.  We have 10% of our entire population in prison.  All these things were made possible under Gaddafi&#39;s leadership.  So you will pardon me if I don&#39;t buy the &quot;he randomly kills his own people&quot; BS story.  This is a man who has worked too hard on behalf of the welfare of his people for that to even make any sense.</p>

<p>The problem is not that he is wasteful or surrounded by luxury, he is an authoritarian dictator.
He doesn&#39;t randomly kill his own people, just all the ones who disagree with him. Dissent is illegal, assassinations are relatively common, the prisons are full of political prisoners and freedom of speech is virtually non existent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, and I&#39;m not going to stand here and say that that doesn&#39;t happen.  From what I understand, dissent and opposition are pretty much quelled where they crop up.  But I compare that to his policies of actually making life better for the Libyan people, and the fact that some of his policies threaten the western economies, and I remain open to the possibility that the &#39;dissidents&#39; may well be provocateurs set up to distort his image in the world media and provide justification for the sorts of things that we&#39;re seeing from NATO now.  I could be dead wrong, I freely admit that.  But when a leader tries to steer his nation away from under the influence of western hegemony and dependence, it threatens western economy and the illusion of absolute dominance around the globe.  They will do whatever they need to to make sure a thorn in their side is removed.  But in order to move in and attack someone in a sovereign nation, it <em>has</em> to appear justified, else the entire world would speak out against it, and the image of Europe and America as the bastions of justice and freedom would be destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres no point getting angry about it no point calling people sheep, it just alienates them. I&#39;ll say at this point i completely disagree with the libyan offensive, i dont disagree with the UN resolution, but i disagree with the usage of that UN resolution as a fig leaf for regime change. Especially since the rebels story is becoming murkier (the death of general Younis) and amnesty international has said there were no mass rapes etc. The reasons for it are amply clear as well, oil/africom ghaddafi flipping the bird to the US. 
TL:DR
agreed, but dont alienate the people who can help to change whats happening </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only had two posts about Libya from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hit my frontpage and none offered proof further then the author&#39;s word.</p>

<p>I dived into it myself and got more info, but considering how smug the reaction has been here instead of posting direct evidence doesn&#39;t help your cause to convince the hivemind at all.</p>
