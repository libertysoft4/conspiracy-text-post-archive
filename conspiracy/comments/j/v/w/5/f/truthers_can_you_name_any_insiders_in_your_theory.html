<p>My concern is that it is near impossible to get names because very very few would have known enough details to be considered guilty. If someone has names, GREAT. If not, it doesn&#39;t mean the events never took place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>poignant. but i am not trying to fool anyone.  it reminds me of creationism.  since you can&#39;t answer x, y, and z, it has to be {god}.  it is an argument of the gaps.  sure i currently accept the generally accepted narrative, but i am open to evidence of conspiracy for sure.</p>

<p>The problem is there is no proof of conspiracy.  You have to have conspirators to prove conspiracy, that is what I have been after here, not trying to fool anyone.  All I have seen about that is the seemingly eternal International Jewish Conspiracy (tm).  Yeah, right, and the Reichstag was burnt down by Van der Lubbe.  This is not so much about entertainment as venting frustration.  From what I can tell, this truthr movement is utter nonsense.  I want evidence of a conspiracy to knock down buildings, not evidence that buildings were knocked down.  As a pilot, a guy that works in a wobbly high rise, and given my former career in government, I have little doubt in the prevailing narrative.  Government and corporate operations are far too shortsighted for them to be as omnipowerful as truthers would like.  Secrets that great are too great to be secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue there&#39;s plenty <em>evidence</em> out there to make a case for conspiracy.  I think where you&#39;re hung up, and where you and I differ, is that you need someone to point a finger at.  </p>

<p>As a rule I hate dividing people into dichotomous groups but for the purpose of this discussion: There are people who value personal gain over human life and those who do not.  Individuals who have success in the global political arena are exclusively of the former.  Notable exceptions like Gandhi, Dali Lama, Mandela while <em>popular</em> for their beliefs, have  little influence on global politics.  The fact of the matter is, the individuals occupying positions of power throughout the world value that power more than human life.  That&#39;s how they got there, that&#39;s why they stay there and our political system rewards them for it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to have a name because for me they are all the same person.  Terrorists, Fascists, Communists, Neo-cons, Liberals, Nationalists, Dictators, Despots, Imperialists, Emperors...it&#39;s all semantics.  If you <em>really</em> want to know who would/could have orchestrated something like 9/11 just follow the money (plenty of people around here will help you with that).  Who profited? The answer is always at the end of the rainbow.  </p>

<p>If you are looking for evidence that something foul took place, as a pilot, you might find <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/pentagon.html">this</a> interesting.        </p>

Secondly, it would take longer than 4 days to pack a building for demolition, and would involve a brigade of workers.  Can you find one of them?

    <div class="md"><p>I am a pilot, and I am very interested in accidents (best to learn than repeat).
I point to saudi 163, air france 358, china air 120.  Take a look, much less catastrophic accidents than flying into a building, plenty of deformed and molten metal.  Melting metal is not even necessary for catastrophic loss of structural integrity, you would not &#39;melt steel&#39; to destroy a building.</p>

<p>But this is besides the point.
Out of the thousands of people that it took to orchestrate this, the only reason that we have to show that they haven&#39;t been found is they are profound secret-keepers, showing a skill greater than any large-scale US, Israeli, Soviet, or German operation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh . . . . </p>

<p>Melted steel columns from building 7, you know about building 7, right, the one that was demoloshed on Sept 11. Well FEMA got some debris and tried to analyse it. Please go look at <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">FEMA Appendix C</a>. </p>

<p>The first picture you see is a wide flange beam. Are you seriously telling me that you know how that beam melted. The authors of the report say the cause of the melted steel was an unknown phenomenon. Here&#39;s what they said in conclusion:&quot;A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon(the melted steel) is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires.&quot;</p>

<p>Considering that, I hope you don&#39;t take the position that you know what caused it and they don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Now take a minute to look at this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNOM_U5UM6Q#t=10m34s">video</a>.</p>

<p>When you have looked at the pictures in the FEMA report and look at what the steel beams look like from the use of thermite on them, is there any chance you can see the similarity? Everyone I know that looks at the images say that they look exactly alike.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your explanation of what cause the melted steel in building 7?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The military has been using thermite for demolition since WWII.</p>

<p>The following is cut and paste from United States Military Field Manual FM 5-250;</p>

<p>Explosives and Demolitions; June 1992: Page 86</p>

<p>3-6. Steel-Cutting Charges.
(d) Nickel-molybdenum steel. This type of steel cannot be cut easily by conventional steel-cutting charges. The jet from a shaped charge will penetrate it, but cutting requires multiple charges or linear-shaped charges. Nickel-molybdenum steel shafts can be cut with a diamond charge. However, the saddle charge will not cut nickel-molybdenum shafts. Therefore, use some method other than explosives to cut nickel-molybdenum steel, such as <strong>thermite</strong> or acetylene or electrical cutting tools. &lt;<a href="http://militarynewbie.com/pubs/FM%205-250%20Explosives%20And%20Demolitions%20Manual.pdf">source</a> - search for thermite&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, there are no Military Field Manuals.  There are Army Field Manuals, there are Marine Corps Field Manuals, but no USMFM.  You are talking about a superseded USA FM.
Secondly, there is 1 mention of thermite in that manual, ONE (and actual methods of thermite usage? NONE.  this is field expedience).  And that is not a source for demolition, but for cutting through nickel-molybdenum steel (just cutting, that is all).<br/>
Thirdly, nickel-molybdenum steel was used not as structural steel in WTC, but in the facade.  You would not use thermite to blow out the structural members (see the word <em>blow</em>, you would blow, as in expansion of volume, not burn through members to destroy a building (well, you would cut members in prep for demo, but then you would blow)
Again, find me a person, an actual person in the small army that it would&#39;ve taken to pull off this operation, and I would have no problem moving towards your camp.  Instead you find me an Army manual written in a 6th grade level with one mention of thermite.  Quite parochial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>3-6. is under the heading: </p>

<p>&quot;a. Target Factors. The following target factors are critical in <strong>steel-structure demolitions</strong>, more so than with other materials:</p>

<p>1 Target Configuration. The configuration of the steel in the structure determines the type and amount of charge necessary for successful demolition. Examples of structured steel are I-beams, <strong>wide-flange beams</strong>, channels, angle sections, structural tees, and steel plates used in <strong>building</strong> or bridge construction.&quot;</p>

<p>I have no idea where you are coming from. The manual clearly states that they use thermite to demolish buildings. I have no idea how you can reject that. </p>

<p>Explain to me why the army field manual on explosives and demolitions is not a valid source when examining the use of thermite in demolitions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that in 1993 there was an attempt to blow up the WTC with explosives, wouldn&#39;t you consider it prudent to look for explosives in the building that collapsed on 911 that was not hit by a plane. Wouldn&#39;t it also be prudent to see who was responsible for the 1993 attempt to blow up the WTC and see if they were connected?</p>

<p>Most would think that&#39;s reasonable.</p>

<p>Do you realize that Emad Salem, the person that set up the 1993 attempt worked for the FBI. Would you be surprised that after the attempt, he was left to the wolves. But hark! Emad Salem had recorded his phone conversations with his FBI handlers. </p>

<p>&quot;Salem, initially believing that this was to be a sting operation, claimed that the FBI&#39;s original plan was for Salem to <strong>supply the conspirators with a harmless powder instead of actual explosive to build their bomb</strong>, but that the FBI chose to use him for other purposes instead. He secretly recorded hundreds of hours of telephone conversations with his FBI handlers&quot; &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing">source</a>&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://deadlinelive.info/2011/03/03/memory-hole-video-of-the-day-dan-rather-cbs-fbi-involvement-in-1993-wtc-bombing/">Here</a> is Dan Rather&#39;s report on it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/nyregion/tapes-depict-proposal-to-thwart-bomb-used-in-trade-center-blast.html?src=pm">New York Times</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;The transcripts, which are stamped &quot;draft&quot; and compiled from 70 tapes recorded secretly during the last two years by Mr. Salem, were turned over to defense lawyers&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In one of the first numbered tapes, Mr. Salem is quoted as telling agent Floyd: &quot;Since the bomb went off I feel terrible. I feel bad. I feel here is people who don&#39;t listen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The transcript quotes Mr. Salem as saying that he wanted to complain to F.B.I. headquarters in Washington about the bureau&#39;s failure to stop the bombing, but was dissuaded by an agent identified as John Anticev.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you deny,&quot; Mr. Salem says he told the other agent, &quot;your supervisor is the main reason of bombing the World Trade Center?&quot; Mr. Salem said Mr. Anticev did not deny it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He requested to make me to testify and if he didn&#39;t push for that, we&#39;ll be going building the bomb with a phony powder and grabbing the people who was involved in it. But since you, we didn&#39;t do that.&quot;</p>
