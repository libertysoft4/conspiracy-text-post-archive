    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, this is entirely incorrect. The human mind is completely capable of holding two contradictory views of something. It does it all the time. Think of Stockholm syndrome, for instance, or people that both love and hate their parents. </p>

<p>The main issue is when this stance becomes conscious (when we become conscious of our own self-contradiction and/or hypocrisy). Our Western cultural imprint allows for only stark binaries. Other cultures throughout history, and even today, allow for contradictory beliefs without a serious crisis of cognitive dissonance. So it isn&#39;t an issue of our minds being unable, it is an issue of our cultural cognitive maps being unable to.</p>

<p>The key is reprogramming your own cognitive map to allow for cognitive dissonance, so that you can both exist in the current paradigm and also be aware of the fallibility/falsehood of it. It&#39;s entirely possible to do, and becomes especially effective with the aid of psychedelics. If one does make use of psychedelics for this end, it is important to pay attention to the three main constituents of the trip, the dosage, the setting, and your own mental state. The setting is particularly important, because this is ends up imprinting the new possibilities in your cognitive map.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that <strong>everyday people</strong> have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance. It reduces stress, makes them at ease or whatever. They do this by changing their attitudes, beliefs, and actions OR having other people /organisations do it for them.   </p>

<p>In the case of the OP title, this can and does include <em>lies</em> told by an establishment, group, or person.<br/>
The bigger the group, the easier it is to succumb to the lie.</p>

<p>This dissonance is also reduced by the individual justifying, blaming, or denying.  (e.g. religion, government, global warming, conspiracies et-al)</p>

<p>In the case of Doublethink, the target is strategically bombarded with &quot;opposing views in the same statement&quot; e.g. war is peace, freedom is slavery, etc. These are contradictory views that have the effect of <em>cancelling out each other</em> thus nullifying the whole argument.  It works on most people.  </p>

<p>In contrast, which statement is true?<br/>
1 Bombing Libya is right ; </p>

<p>2 Bombing Libya is wrong   </p>

<p>It&#39;s a polarizing question that most people will answer with a straight right/wrong.  </p>

<p>Put it in doublespeak and it has a different effect.    </p>

<p>for those who are on the fence regarding bombing Libya Cameron or Obama or whoever will put out a statement like <strong>&quot;bombing Libya protects Libyans and is therefore right&quot;</strong>... <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12781149">echoed by the media</a> it reverberates until &#39;a majority&#39; accepts the polarised view that carpet bombing a city is the right thing to do.  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110725190044.htm">This <em>majority</em> can be as low as 10% of the population in most cases as this article highlights</a>  </p>

<p>So it isn&#39;t an issue of our minds being unable, it is an issue of our cultural cognitive maps being unable to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This needs to be injected into the American social conversation more often. Too many Americans know they may be on the wrong side of issues, but as long as they believe they will personally benefit from being on the &#39;wrong&#39; side, they stop caring about right and wrong and claim &#39;individualism&#39; as a defense. </p>

<p>Just today, a co-worker brought up some inane story about a basketball player Palin may or may not have fucked, and I mentioned that this &#39;news&#39; tidbit is clearly some kind of marketing play to further cash in on a falling star that has no more importance than the Kate Gosling&#39;s of the world. This same person then said that they brought it up because it was &quot;humorous, not because [they] wanted to discuss it.&quot;</p>

<p>Huh? She then immediately &quot;agreed to disagree&quot; and would not pursue any conversation on the topic further, stating repeatedly that we&#39;d already agreed to disagree, when in fact she is the only one that said as such. This is a gainfully employed adult, part of the electorate. </p>

<p>This is the kind of &#39;social narcotics junkie&#39; we are up against as persons working towards a rational outlier to the constant propaganda arrayed against us in America. People outside of America like to poke fun at how &#39;stupid&#39; Americans are, but this is a direct result of it being profitable for Americans to be stupid. Therefore, anyone that wants Americans, or indeed themselves, to awake from commercial slumber finds themselves in direct opposition to not only the monetary and moral forces that run Government/Corporate, but also their family, friends, lovers, and strangers. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very daunting mental task to simply reprogram yourself once you start discovering the truth about America in a way that allows you to both &quot;see the fjords&quot; and function within the lies that make up Our Way Of Life. Waking others is a dangerous, unpredictable prospect. It can end in hate, anger, and dissolvement of said relationship. </p>

<p>We can lead Americans to information, but we cannot make them think. Otherwise the cultural circuit breaker flips and YOU become the enemy. A fine line must be walked, and I say must because only these people can begin dismantling humanity&#39;s machine of self-destruction; it lives in their backyard.</p>

1 Bombing Libya is right ; </p>

<p>2 Bombing Libya is wrong   </p>

<p>It&#39;s a polarizing question that most people will answer with a straight right/wrong.  </p>

<p>Put it in doublespeak and it has a different effect.    </p>

<p>for those who are on the fence regarding bombing Libya Cameron or Obama or whoever will put out a statement like <strong>&quot;bombing Libya protects Libyans and is therefore right&quot;</strong>... <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12781149">echoed by the media</a> it reverberates until &#39;a majority&#39; accepts the polarised view that carpet bombing a city is the right thing to do.  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110725190044.htm">This <em>majority</em> can be as low as 10% of the population in most cases as this article highlights</a>  </p>

<p>This needs to be injected into the American social conversation more often. Too many Americans know they may be on the wrong side of issues, but as long as they believe they will personally benefit from being on the &#39;wrong&#39; side, they stop caring about right and wrong and claim &#39;individualism&#39; as a defense. </p>

<p>Just today, a co-worker brought up some inane story about a basketball player Palin may or may not have fucked, and I mentioned that this &#39;news&#39; tidbit is clearly some kind of marketing play to further cash in on a falling star that has no more importance than the Kate Gosling&#39;s of the world. This same person then said that they brought it up because it was &quot;humorous, not because [they] wanted to discuss it.&quot;</p>

<p>Huh? She then immediately &quot;agreed to disagree&quot; and would not pursue any conversation on the topic further, stating repeatedly that we&#39;d already agreed to disagree, when in fact she is the only one that said as such. This is a gainfully employed adult, part of the electorate. </p>

<p>This is the kind of &#39;social narcotics junkie&#39; we are up against as persons working towards a rational outlier to the constant propaganda arrayed against us in America. People outside of America like to poke fun at how &#39;stupid&#39; Americans are, but this is a direct result of it being profitable for Americans to be stupid. Therefore, anyone that wants Americans, or indeed themselves, to awake from commercial slumber finds themselves in direct opposition to not only the monetary and moral forces that run Government/Corporate, but also their family, friends, lovers, and strangers. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very daunting mental task to simply reprogram yourself once you start discovering the truth about America in a way that allows you to both &quot;see the fjords&quot; and function within the lies that make up Our Way Of Life. Waking others is a dangerous, unpredictable prospect. It can end in hate, anger, and dissolvement of said relationship. </p>

<p>We can lead Americans to information, but we cannot make them think. Otherwise the cultural circuit breaker flips and YOU become the enemy. A fine line must be walked, and I say must because only these people can begin dismantling humanity&#39;s machine of self-destruction; it lives in their backyard.</p>
