        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My wife and I have been talking about the Denver Airport for the last hour. I think that the symbolism in the construction and art shows that the Free Masons are behind it, attempting to make some sort of statement. She thinks that these are just artists and architects may be performing a conspiracy of sorts, but does not have enough evidence to prove it to her. Can anyone help with somewhat concrete evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, this is your problem. You take the word of a self proclaimed conspiracy theorist as gospel. Yes there are symbols, but symbols have no inherent meaning beyond that which the interpreter ascribes. Do you think this guy on the internet isn&#39;t a little biased in his interpretations? Does he know what the artists intended when they made the symbols? It seems to me if you were really troubled by these things and were truly trying to find an objective, logical truth you&#39;d ask these questions and do a deeper investigation than just asking the internet paranoids. No. It&#39;s so much easier (and a lot more fun) to sensationalize and jump to any conclusions you want. You&#39;re just as bad as my neighbors who take Sarah pain and glen beck as the two-headed second coming of our lord and savior. All of you make me want to barf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point. There is no information to suggest any conspiracy. People jump to conclusions because they find &quot;buzz words&quot; and images they&#39;ve been trained to look out for. It&#39;s like the goddamn 23 enigma. Someone tells you 23 is important so you start noticing it everywhere and come up with excuses as to how they&#39;re all related. It&#39;s akin to the brainwashing you get on fox news. Here&#39;s a novel idea: shut up until there&#39;s some actual evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to mock, but I&#39;m suspicious about the Denver/Mason connection. Sure, maybe... but another explanation is that certain artists are obsessed with symbolism for other reasons (aesthetic, some connection to tradition, sense of artistic legitimacy). I had an art prof back in the undergrad days who was like this. He went on and on about the golden section, five- and six-pointed stars, the elegance of medieval typeface (individual letters and their super-elegant proportions), etc. He put all kinds of semi-mystical symbolism in his own art, but I never got the sense he was sending messages more deep than the basic symbolism of the symbols themselves. He liked their aesthetics and historicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is definitely an option. I was fresh from the &quot;discussion&quot; so I may have been a little polarized. It will be difficult for us to prove the intentions behind art. There do seem to be many odd choices for this building. thanks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, I&#39;m not ruling out the Illuminati/Templars/Whatever ideas, either; but it seems simpler to just imagine that it&#39;s a symbol-obsessed architect or two. Of course, if it&#39;s the former, I figure that will become apparent, eventually, because there should be some functional element to doing all the symbolism, instead of mere aesthetics. So I suppose time will tell.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what if it&#39;s a symbol-obsessed Illuminati who did it just for the fun of it? Then we&#39;ll never know.</p>

<p>Know this. You would be a brave man to try and gain access to unauthorized areas. But you would need to prepare beforehand with information no one has. And you would need to evade a military force and countermeasures no one in the public has information on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry. Misunderstood/read too fast (as usual).
But this thread has got me going. I&#39;m now procrastinating very important work by reading websites on the conspiracy theories (and attempted debunkings of such) on le internets. Fun times today :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the freemasons are mocking you with their hidden messages of world domination... in the Denver airport? Why the Denver airport? Well, because if anyone claimed there were secret messages in the airport, they would be called a fool. Naturally, the best way to conduct a conspiracy is to leave clues out in the open but in silly places of no importance so it would seem like a coincidence. This way anyone who really catches on just alienates themselves and subsequently the Truth from the rest of society with seemingly ridiculous notions. Seriously though, you should read the illuminates! Trilogy if you haven&#39;t already. If you have, I have nothing more to say but... 5 tons of flax! Silly paranoids.</p>

<p>Edit: I should have called you <strong>stupid</strong> paranoids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s me saying I&#39;m pretty sure by your tone and your words you&#39;re very familiar with the climate change theories, but you don&#39;t think the science is sound because your talking head of choice with a degree in communications says so. </p>

<p>So. I literally don&#39;t believe there&#39;s anything I could say to you that would result in a objective conversation, much less change your mind. And there&#39;s other more interesting ways I could waste my time available to me right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do I have to be a drooling slave to a talking head in order to disagree with you? It can&#39;t possibly be that the theories aren&#39;t backed by any solid evidence and are just grasping ay straws. They must be true, therefore anyone who doesn&#39;t believe is an ignorant puppet. This is the problem with conspiracy theories. Again, why can&#39;t it just be an airport? You see, the logical approach is to have a standard of sufficient hard evidence before submitting belief and championing something as truth. These theories are based on speculation of, at best, suspicion. You fool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And for all we know it could be a covert alien embassy where the MIB do most of their immigration. You see, the reason why we don&#39;t believe this or any of the other infinite imaginative possibilities is for a lack of sufficient evidence. first, it&#39;s an airport. When you have evidence then you can tell me there&#39;s a conspiracy. Until that day, it&#39;s an airport with some weird art choices. Occam&#39;s razor, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But all of that doesn&#39;t preclude me or others from asking why this particular overbudget airport with strange art choices was built when a perfectly fine airport was already in place. </p>

<p>No one should ever not be allowed to ask questions. And asking questions doesn&#39;t make you a &quot;conspiracy kook&quot;. Just a theorist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean &quot;behind it&quot;?  The airport was approved (and desired) by the city.  They farmed it out to hundreds, if not thousands of contracting companies.   </p>

<p>And, what symbolism?  The runways look like a swastika?  Yeah, that is a coincidence because it happens to be an efficient way to keep runways separate, but all meet back in the terminals in the center.</p>

<p>The artwork?  Yeah, some of it&#39;s odd, but who knows?  A lot of it is just functional art, and has little meaning.  Some celebrates the history of the state.  </p>

<p>The &quot;new world airport commission&quot; or whatever it was called?  That was, as far as anyone can tell, basically an LLC set up solely for the dedication party when the airport was opened.  Really.</p>

<p>And, to what end?  Do you think this is an indoctrination because people see the art and think &quot;that&#39;s odd?&quot; and somehow fall under a spell?</p>
