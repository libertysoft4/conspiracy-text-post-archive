<p>Good articles to read on this (Some are about LulzSec which IS Anonymous):
<a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/08/14/another-pointless-anonymous-attack-2001-names-and-passwords-of-mybart-users-leaked/">Anonymous leaks over 2k login/passwords and even personal addresses and phone numbers of people who used myBART to try to get coupons.. do they really seem like the elite or government fatcats? come on..</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/07/05/exclusive-after-being-arrested-orlando-activists-feed-homeless-at-city-hall/">Orlando Food Not Bombs didn&#39;t appreciate Anonymous&#39; hackings either</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/06/its-official-anonymous-hackers-are-now.html">&quot;A hacking group claiming to be part of &quot;Anonymous&quot; has announced the successful takeover of Iran&#39;s servers, which seems like a huge amount of work put into an agenda that seems to stray dramatically far away from their declared war on the Global Banking Cartel.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://republicbroadcasting.org/?p=15904">In early July.. &quot;What exactly was Anonymous expecting to gain with the release of personal information of persons not directly involved with the ordinance and the arrests that are made because of it? Again, would it not be more constructive to take direct action and actually feed people instead of leaking passwords?&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all please keep in mind that &quot;Anonymous&quot; can be many groups with many different agendas... can be for - or against - you whatever your point of reference may be.</p>

<p>Have they done anything that is really significant?  Better asked this way... Have the things they have done been significant enough to justify the fact that they are mostly done illegally? When answering that question remember to weight the benefit of their actions against the perception of threat to the public based on the nature of their actions.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m leaning toward the idea that they are doing more toward justifying internet control and restriction then they do for their stated cause.  That may be unintentional, or it may be a side effect of different agendas, or maybe it is the real agenda... I don&#39;t know.</p>

<li><p>The government is impressed with anon. It has reached a stalemate with them however. The governments will keep the internet free and open (they need this more than you would realize) as long as they can freely employ elite anons as highly paid mercenaries in the ongoing info-war. Geohot is one example of this - having been brought into the inner circle of facebook.  </p></li>
<li><p>This strategy is nothing new to the historian. A prime example is the Ghurkas of Nepal and the East India Company of the British.  In the 1800&#39;s. The difference here is that the Gurkha had leadership to negotiate with back them. Today anon doesn&#39;t and that&#39;s what makes it very intriguing.</p></li>
<li><p>??  </p></li>
<li><p>Profit  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anon is just the interwebs version of a disgruntled rioter with a bone to pick with whoever is currently pissing them off. A modern day Robin Hood in some cases but a terrorist to others. Depends where you sit to view either as valid.</p>

1. physical which I describe above.

It&#39;s not like that information is even personal or private anymore, it&#39;s not like someone is going to rob their myBART accounts and steal all their coupons.  But, yes they will absolutely use it to justify taking away more of our freedoms, but that&#39;s beside the point, because it doesn&#39;t matter, now if anon would just do something truly enlightening to the masses that&#39;d be something to care about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think whether the internet will be locked down is more an issue of when than if.  If you think that by being good little boys and girls we can avoid this sort of thing, then you don&#39;t understand how they operate.  Is this going to happen as a result of a legitimate hacktivistic action or a false flag seems inconsequential.  Furthermore, can you really call it a false flag when anonymous is essential not carrying a flag at all.</p>

<p>In the end it&#39;s all just a cat and mouse game.  We&#39;ll be winning for a while and then they&#39;ll change something and they&#39;ll have the upper hand.  Then we&#39;ll find a way to circumvent that and once again we&#39;ll have the upper hand.</p>

<p>I expect that in 2 to 3 years we&#39;ll have digital SS cruising the nets telling us, &quot;show me your papers.&quot;</p>
