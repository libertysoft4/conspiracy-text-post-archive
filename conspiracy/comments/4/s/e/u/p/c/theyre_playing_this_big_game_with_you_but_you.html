<p>The d33p state is a group of (global) &#39;resource managers&#39;.  A collusion of corporate interests and bad elements embedded within intelligence agencies, forming &#39;a cryptocracy&#39; or &#39;shadow government&#39;. In the case of America, the COG governance as a result of 9/11.  It is also clear that with projects such as EC4ELON, that this &#39;d33p state&#39; has gone international, which we know from Snowden&#39;s revelations.  We have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">fiveeyes</a> and even 9, 14, 49 eyes.  This is a cooperation of many d33p states, making a &#39;d33p network&#39;.   </p>

<p><strong>Non--linear Warfare</strong></p>

<p>--[From <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html"><em>BBC&#39;s Adam Curtis On The &quot;Contradictory Vaudeville&quot; Of Post-Modern Politics&quot;</em></a>]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So much of the news this year has been hopeless, depressing, and above all, confusing. To which the only response is to say, <strong>&quot;oh dear.&quot;</strong> What this film is going to suggest is that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this <em>defeatist response has become a central part of a new system of political control.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called <em>Vladislav Surkov</em>, who is a hero of our time.   <em>Surkov</em> is one of President Putin&#39;s advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. </p>

<p>He came originally from the <em>avant-garde</em> art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics. His aim is to undermine peoples&#39; perceptions of the world, so they never know what is really happening. </p>

<p>Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads to liberal human rights groups. He even backed parties that were opposed to President Putin.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the key thing was, that <em>Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: &quot;It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused.&quot; A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called <strong><em>non-linear war</em></strong>. <em>A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are</em>. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Non--line-ar Warfare&#39;s aim is a psychological shutdown response or &quot;Oh Dearism&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gaslighting the International Everycitizen</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s a non stop stream of confusion and spectacle in the news that Adam Curtis points out in his videos above.  Of course, the media has been incentivized to respond more quickly and sensationally, rather than accurately and honestly, so we end up with stories that make no sense.  But it&#39;s not just their activities alone.  There are also proven cases where the FBI has &#39;groomed terrorists&#39;, most notably in the first truck bomb to injury the WTC in the early 90s.  The people directly involved came forward.</p>

<p>Confusing stories aren&#39;t the end of it.  It&#39;s the non-stop litany of intrigues, upsets, disappointments, betrayals and fears.   False flags, mass shootings, fake uprisings, false outrage, mass surveillance and spending that has not yielded one single case of protecting the us, confusing stories, differential legalism for the elite, pedophilia in the government, unpunished ruling class, occult mockery, symbol abuse, poisoned food, information destruction, privacy destruction, privatization of natural resources, proliferation of gmos despite their provable problems, confusing drug laws, confusing predictions of the future, equally terrible presidential candidates, divide and conquer for social justice issues, trans-everything agendas, mixed messages regarding the pursuit of higher education, dwindling trust of institutions, the willful blindness of 9/11 and a long history of provable conspiracy, the cognitive dissonance and low information of the current american, the willing participation in corruption through the continued use of and dependence on knowingly corrupted and elitst financial instruments (insider trading for the &#39;insiders&#39;), a tacit toleration of corruption, secrecy, elitism and a general, intractable apathy.</p>

<p>Welcome to the confuse-o-tron.  STAY CALM AND _____</p>

<p>In summary, it&#39;s very clear to me at least that the establishment has decided long ago to wage a longstanding nounlinyear warfare against the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  It took several times to get it to ascend in karma.  It was immediately downvoted to 0, three times.  Obviously this is a subversive post with that much spite.  I started monitoring, it was up to 5, even 7 once, then an hour later, 0.  Nearly every time.</p>

<p>I know it was a decent post, maybe not my best, but still  I figured 0 was not right.  I had to keep changing certain words like deep and nonlinear warfare because I think their downbots were hitting this post really very hard this week.  actually many of my posts are doing badly this week which means they are out in full force</p>

<p>Yet more validation for my thesis that &quot;the art world&quot; is the secret university of the elite.  Art is one of the few domains in which the narrative can&#39;t really be mutated.  One&#39;s art is one&#39;s art.  Unlike texts which can be rewritten, or oral histories which can have names  changed, for example.  Art tends to have a more untainted narrative.  The elite even joke about it (<a href="http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Jacobim_Mugatu">http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Jacobim_Mugatu</a>).  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOrI6uqS-vk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOrI6uqS-vk</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you like this kind of thing and you really want validation.  I HIGHLY SUGGEST you go on amazon, try out the 7day trial of GAIA.COM and then watch this series <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017SXHLBW/ref=dv_web_wtls_list_pr_0_ba">ARCANUM</a>.  It will seriously, seriously, blow your f* mind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about whistleblowing on gnosticism, esoterica within famous art pieces.  It&#39;s something that makes an otherwise boring subject (to me at least) of art history come alive in the most fascinating way.</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;ll find out why George Washington is the freemasons&#39; messiah</li>
<li>That the Capitol building in DC is the third temple of Solomon</li>
<li>What the Capitol dome &#39;Apotheosis of George Washington&#39; is about</li>
<li>How freemasons are alchemists engaged in a very longstanding nonlinear spiritual war with everyone</li>
<li>Suggestions that the ecclesiastical tradition is a &#39;cover story&#39; for real esoteric beliefs about Jesus, Mary (both wife magdalene and virgin jmom)</li>
<li>Keys to egypt, esoteric Judaeism and more.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s extremely good.  These show hosts clearly are in on many secrets and do a fine job of describing them.</p>
