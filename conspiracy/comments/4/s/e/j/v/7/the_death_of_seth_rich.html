        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">81</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-07-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/kurtchella.html">kurtchella</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, R.I.P to this young and aspiring person. I do not mean to offend his legacy just by posting here. I sincerely hope he will be resting in peace and that his family will be consoled during this tough time. </p>

<p>SETH RICH was a young Washington D.C insider, hired by the Democratic National Committee/Convention, who was assassinated early this morning, July 11th. He was hired by Democratic National Committee Chairwoman (and former co-chair of HILLARY Clinton&#39;s 2008 campaign) Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in June 2014 as the official &quot;voter expansion data director&quot; for this election season. </p>

<p>Here is what I personally find suspicious about his very recent death: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Debbie Wasserman-Schultz criticized the Bernie Sanders campaign of hacking into the NGP VAN voter database back in December of last year. NGP VAN has previously contributed to <em>the Clinton campaign</em>. In addition, it could have been entirely possible, given the many scandals surrounding Clinton, that the Clinton campaign may have taken crucial information or restricted the Sanders campaign from having stronger momentum in the days leading up to the Iowa primary. This is an entirely different topic though. Certainly Mr. Rich would have been aware of the particular data hacked or taken at this time. </p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Rich was hired by the DNC in June 2014. Earlier in 2014, the Clintons announced a voter initiative project meant at counteracting voter ID laws &amp; the stripping of provisions in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Another intention of this collaboration with the DNC was to increase voter turnout. Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz at the time said she wished to make sure that &quot;everyone who wants to vote and is eligible has an opportunity to register, has an opportunity to turnout and can have their vote accurately counted.&quot; However, it has been noted continuously by progressive media and r/sandersforpresident that Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz has deliberately done everything in her power <em>to discourage voters</em> from having their voices heard/accurately counted, thus creating another shield for Hillary Clinton from potentially losing to an &quot;outsider&quot; progressive. <em>Could Mr. Rich have expressed a personal conflicting opinion after the NGP VAN leak which would&#39;ve made Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz more angry?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Another Reddit user on r/politics noticed that Mr. Rich&#39;s LinkedIn Page detailed his work for a firm called Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. The CEO of this firm is a man named Stan Greenberg, a man who was a <em>leading political strategist for Bill Clinton</em> during his presidency. This man also re-branded BP as a &quot;green&quot; petroleum company. <em>Is it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public&#39;s disdain for oil industry/fracking?</em> Clearly going against the oil industry would mean a significant loss of profits. The U.S, as it is, has been oil dependent for ages, and the fight to change the climate has never been hotter than right now. </p></li>
<li><p>In the months leading up to the BP oil spill, Mr. Rich was also a legislative affairs consultant for another firm called &quot;Kissel E &amp; S Associates.&quot; When I happened to google &quot;Kissel E&amp;S Associates, Clinton&quot;, one of the front page results led to a University of Nebraska paper, <em>and written during Hillary Clinton&#39;s tenure as Secretary of State.</em> This paper is titled &quot;Conflicts in the Licensing Process for
TransCanada&#39;s Keystone XL Pipeline.&quot; <em>The Keystone XL Pipeline is one of the MANY positions on which Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped on. Could Mr. Rich have dissented with some very powerful oil company interests who were looking to negotiate a backroom deal with the DNC?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Rich also happened to previously work for former Nebraska Senator &amp; Governor Ben Nelson. Former Senator Nelson happens to be a more conservative-leaning Democrat, but he also happened to be on the Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittees on Homeland Security/Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and was a member of the International Conservation Caucus. Senator Nelson, in 2010, was the deciding vote to help block a Wall Street reform bill. <em>He also contributed a crucial vote to help pass Obamacare back in 2009.</em> Senator Nelson also suddenly quit his position in 2013, and was at the center of the Obamacare Supreme Court ruling last year. Finally, I don&#39;t think that this is related to the conspiracy theory at hand, but last October, his daughter died from an accidental fall. </p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Rich was murdered in the back by an unknown assailant with a gun. At 4:20 in the morning. Near Howard University. Not exactly the type of person who would be targeted in a nicer area of D.C. (I am aware D.C has lots of impoverished areas/urban decay.) The District of Columbia happens to have a ban on the sale or purchase of handguns, but nearby Virginia has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the country. And although there are many insiders who work for Washington D.C, <em>wouldn&#39;t it take someone with intelligence to know and particularly target somebody who happened to have crucial intelligence that could decide this election?</em></p></li>
<li><p>The police, as of July 11, don&#39;t have any suspects, witnesses, or surveillance footage at this time. They also refused to comment if it was possibly related to recent robberies in the neighborhood. It can be disputed that this was but a botched robbery, however, because <em>nothing was taken</em> from Mr. Rich&#39;s dead body. One of the earliest rumored victims of the &quot;Clinton body count&quot; was Mary Mahoney, who died in a similar fashion as she was about to testify against Bill Clinton (and who had nothing taken from her body at the time of her death.)  (In comparison, The Manson family didn&#39;t steal anything from Sharon Tate&#39;s house when they brutally murdered her and others. The Family was also accused of killing multiple potential dissenters during and after Manson&#39;s trial, for a sickening comparison.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The TIMING</strong> of this tragedy seems too &#39;coincidental&#39;/accurately timed. I think/know that: </p>

<p>8a. Mr. Rich&#39;s sudden death comes the day before Bernie Sanders is set to endorse Hillary Clinton at a party unity rally tomorrow. Chairwoman-elect of the Nebraska Democratic Party (Rich&#39;s home state), Jane Kleeb, spoke of Rich as &quot;a young Nebraskan who worked on campaigns and stood for <em>progressive</em> issues.&quot;</p>

<p>8b. As of Monday the 11th, the Democratic National Convention is set to take place in exactly two weeks, and the Republican National Convention in exactly one. In addition, Bernie Sanders is set to speak at FDR Park on the 24th, about where the &quot;political revolution&quot; goes from here. </p>

<p>8c. Hillary-supporting Governor of Connecticut Dan Malloy is currently under investigation over a Cigna merger. Hillary-supporting U.S Rep Corinne Brown is also currently under investigation over her super-gerrymandered Florida district (Wasserman-Schultz is from Florida). </p>

<p>8d. There are currently RICO lawsuits investigating multiple counts of electoral fraud, and surprisingly, these lawsuits are pulling through the courts and gaining traction. Mr. Rich could have been aware of the American people actually standing a chance with these lawsuits, and given his access to crucial voter data, <em>could have decided to be a DNC defector and testify on behalf of the people in charge of these electoral fraud lawsuits.</em></p>

<p>8e. There is still a possibility that Russia/Julian Assange has DNC information and could be planning to leak it to the public in time for the convention. Mr. Rich could have known of this. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> If anyone could have been the one to break the news on possible election fraud, it would have been Mr. Rich. If his death somehow is confirmed as part of corrupt Clinton collusion, then it is important to know that with the major players involved, Mr. Rich would have posed the least significant threat, at least in comparison to Vladimir Putin or those high up in the Washington D.C establishment. Many questions remain on my mind that are, and will probably forever, remain unanswered. I am just what some would dismissingly label as an &quot;armchair activist&quot; or &quot;Reddit lawyer.&quot; Perhaps I have an inherent bias in actual democracy, as you can see in my post history that I&#39;ve been a staunch supporter of Senator Sanders. The context, but mostly imminent timing of the loss of this young insider seems to go beyond &quot;pure coincidence&quot;, despite the number of robberies in the D.C area lately. I believe that Hillary Clinton&#39;s team or the DNC could have colluded to dispose of this young man who happened to be exposed to a little too much information. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It gives me no joy to post this on the day he died, but given his position &amp; timing in politics, I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI, I knew seth personally, and you <em>have</em> offended his legacy. </p>

<p>Seriously, when you guys post this stuff, do you not stop to think, even for a second, that this is someone&#39;s son? Someone&#39;s friend? Someone&#39;s brother? And how it comes across when you try to fit their death into your conspiratorial agenda?</p>

<p>What if this was someone you knew, and were close with, and a bunch of strangers on the internet were trying to subvert the death of <em>your</em> friend to advance their conspiratorial agenda? </p>

<p>God, as though hearing my friend was gunned down was not bad enough, I have to contend with this shit. </p>

<p>I love... <em>love</em> how you bookend by saying you don&#39;t wanna offend and it &quot;give you no joy&quot; to post this... well if you didn&#39;t wanna offend, you failed, and if it gave you no joy, why the fuck did you post it?  </p>

<p>I know this is a subreddit full of conspiracy mongers, so my logic and common sense won&#39;t go very far but for fuck&#39;s sake have some empathy. Seth was not an &quot;insider&quot; the news stories have inflated his position because they&#39;re trying to honor his death. He was helping build a passive tool that helps voters find their polling place, not registering voters or dealing with the clintons.  </p>

<p>If my brother were murdered and there was even a 1% chance something fishy was going on, I&#39;d sure as shit want the Internet conspiracy bros to do some research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you don&#39;t realize how this offends a person&#39;s legacy, and how it offends his family and friends suggests there&#39;s very little I could say to get you to realize why that is. </p>

<p>That said, I believe you are capable of figuring it out yourself, IF you determine that you actually want to figure it out. IF you actually want to try being empathetic, IF you actually want to try putting yourself in the shoes of his friends and family... you will understand exactly why this is so offensive and disrespectful. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I didn&#39;t really know seth well enough to be grieving... we knew each other for 6 summers, ending in 2006 and hadn&#39;t spoken in 8-9 years... his death was impactful because its someone I knew, but this isn&#39;t an issue of lacking perspective because I&#39;m overcome by grief or something. </p></li>
<li><p>If OP were sensitive, he&#39;d have not posted this at all. I&#39;m confused how anyone can not grasp that. </p></li>

<p>There is a ZERO percent chance though. There is actually, a ZERO percent chance this is part of some vast conspiracy with the Clintons at the center because that is just <em>fucking absurd.</em> Clinton-murder conspiracies are as absurd today as they were 20 years ago when Americans didn&#39;t take those seriously either... Like, try to put that into your head then re-calibrate. I know you&#39;re not going to like me saying that or even believe it, but try to imagine there is a 0% chance that this is anything fishy... then how would you feel? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really... it makes a ton of assertions about what he was doing for the DNC, his relationship to higher ups in that organization and other democrats, where he was and why... what this mostly is, is a conspiracy theory. Admittedly, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... but it is still disrespectful </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my take: Seth Rich was a linked with Wikileaks. Julianne Assagne seems to have Russia as his source. Seth Rich acted as an inside connection to Russian hacking group. Seth Rich knew too much and he was bumped off by the Russian groups that found him to be a risk. Clinton&#39;s had nothing to do with the death. There is no sense behind that. Bottom line is the Russian&#39;s seemed to have a huge invested interest in making sure Clinton lost. </p>
