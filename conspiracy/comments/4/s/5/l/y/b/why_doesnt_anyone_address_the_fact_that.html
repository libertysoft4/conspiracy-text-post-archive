    <div class="md"><p>You know what&#39;s worse?</p>

<p>You just bought the farm across the street with reasonable leverage and a mortgage and sell milk but then the douchebag grandson inherits the farm across the street free and clear and starts under cutting the price of your milk while selling at loss  until he puts you  out of business buys your farm in foreclosure and then doubles price of milk with no competitor.</p>

<p>Inherited money blocks in the economy (which have now become huge) are very damaging to the free market. Its why every economist liberal and conservative beleives in heavy taxation of inheritiance over a base amount.  </p>

<p>One good answer is to force all companies to disolve and  liquidate  and sell all assets Into a competitive marketplace every 20 or 30 years.  This distributes  assets back into the free market so companies like say Walmart can&#39;t distort economies for a hundred years.</p>

<p>All stock holders get paid from the liquidation  and new businesses are started and economic distortions get wiped clean every 20 or 30 years.  So inheritances come only In the form of cash from stock liquiditions and the inheritors must decide how to reallocate that capital into new businesses that hopefully would exist in a more competitve marketplace. There would be no &quot;too big too fail&quot; companies in any business sector.</p>

<p>So what incentive is there to try to make money if it is all taken away every 30 years?  Stupidest shit ever.  I&#39;m sure you would be good with it if it were you, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know when I do a deal I do t to make money that day or that year.
The old argument that no one will want to make money if they cant keep it all forever is ridiculous. People will work to keep whatever they can whenever they can. When the top tax bracket was 90% for 40 years during the greatest economic boom in the united states people still worked hard for the 10%.</p>

<p>And you misunderstand. You dont lose all the money from the business you build. </p>

<p>You just force the company to liquidate. The owners and stock holders still receive the money from the sale. But the various assests and real estate and patents etc are broken up and sold among the market place which quickens the return of assets to a competitve marketplace and keeps them in the highest and best use and destroys monopolies which may have arisen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so true!  I think the same of dead real estate.  The rich don&#39;t need to give anyone else a chance.  Literally, a single big old house in my city, bought 2 generations ago, divided into 4 units is still supporting entire families.  The unmonied simply cannot compete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>People dont often think about the effect that large inherited blocks of money or control of businesses have on the rest of the operaters startng out in the economy.  It kills the more efficient operators becuase the inheritor doesn&#39;t have to worry about efficiency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny how some wealthy libertarians hate government in every way except when law enforcement is defending  all the property they inherited without doing a single thing to earn any of it.  </p>

<p>Lol.</p>

<p>The good news is most lose it all in two generations so they can&quot;t distort the ecomonmy forever (although with new insurance and foundation tax avoidance schemes some massive wealth distortions are once again damaging the free market in some businesses) . You just better hope the store you started and ran at a profit for 30 years doesn&#39;t suddenly have a lucky sperm club inheritor run competitor pop up across the street that doenst have to make a profit for 20 years.</p>

<p>Trump wrote about the &quot;members of the lucky sperm club&quot; in his first book &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot;</p>
