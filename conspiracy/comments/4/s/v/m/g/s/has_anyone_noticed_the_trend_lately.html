        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well, it&#39;s also been going on for quite some time but as of late the amount of predictive programming/propaganda for an alien invasion is at an all time high. Movies, shows, even movie trailers themselves and songs are being pushed more and more as the months go on. </p>

<p>Maybe Wernher Von Braun was right? Maybe a false flag alien invasion is coming and we have been programmed to accept that it will and flee to the government for help and it will dissolve any differences in the world to help governments come together to battle the ET threat.</p>

<p>Maybe what Reagan/other prominent figures including B. Clinton have stated is coming to fruition sooner than we thought, or it&#39;s right on time.</p>

<p>I know it sounds crazy but at this point, I feel like anything is possible and we have to go by what we see/hear because we have been programmed for years for events to happen that have passed. </p>

<p>First it was Communism, then it was terrorism from the Middle East (introducing groups like Al-CIAda and ISIS), and next it makes sense to have an other worldly threat. </p>

<p>I do believe we will need other events to take place like a collapse on a whole other level. Possibly huge storms, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. I know this sounds like Biblical shit but I am not speaking that right now. I can only go by the articles being shown to us every day/news segments/movies/shows/politisphere - that something much more extraordinary than any of us have experienced is going to take place.</p>

<p>Good luck and may whatever god you believe in have mercy on us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that truly a conspiracy or just better odds for the house?</p>

<p>It simply makes them less likely to have to pay out a lot of money. 1000 to 1 seems high. But still... interesting share, have an upvote as an apology for my disagreeing question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you&#39;re completely right the odds do favour the house more but what it means it someone somewhere is putting money on it happening.</p>

<p>The more people people bet on something the lower the odds thats how the bookmaker makes their book by balancing that risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve noticed the trend, and I find a false flag alien invasion likely. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s another possibility, namely that Ken on <a href="http://www.redefininggod.com">www.redefininggod.com</a> is right. Here&#39;s the scenario he describes:</p>

<p>TPTB are using their puppet Obama (who is playing the role as fake Antichrist) to start (a fake) WW3. When Obama launches the first nuclear missiles, &quot;alien&quot; flying saucers appear in the sky, shooting down the missiles before they do any damage.  </p>

<p>These seemingly benevolent aliens appear to be allies of Putin. Putin is &quot;assassinated&quot; (by Medvedev or someone), but apparently rises from the dead, and is hailed as the Messiah. Together with the &quot;aliens&quot;, he rules the world for 3.5 years, when it&#39;s revealed that he&#39;s actually the &quot;real&quot; Antichrist, and that the &quot;benevolent aliens&quot; are as evil as he is. 3.5 years later he&#39;s defeated by the &quot;real&quot; Christ who is also accompanied by aliens. And this &quot;real&quot; Christ will then rule the world as a benevolent dictator for a thousand years or so. </p>

<p>The point here is that the &quot;aliens&quot; are really just black ops genetically modified eugenics experiments. I.e. super humans with telepathic powers. And the &quot;alien spacecraft&quot; are also secret human antigravity technology, appearing in the sky together with impressive holograms aka BlueBeam. </p>

<p>It does sound ridiculous (at least some of it), but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised by anything at this stage. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we&#39;re in for some huge natural disasters, wars and other global catastrophes either way. Things are getting really strange now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, plebs act like &quot;disclosure&quot; is going to occur or that the Nazis at NASA can&#39;t quite keep a lid on it, but in reality the MSM just won&#39;t stop shoving it in our faces.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got that above-the-law whore Killary in on it. The gay, black Muslim communist Pres. Obama pushes it. The Satanic sun-worshipping, pedo-protecting Pope wants to baptise them. The robot-cripple Hawkins is allegedly listening out for them. Even our favorite Oscar-winning, TED talking, VICE Limited Hangout Snowden is part of the act, tackling the techie angle.</p>

<p>If these aliens show up and they look anything like the Holly Wood renditions, just know you&#39;ve been had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such an announcement would be shattering, but the end of people&#39;s faith in a divine presence would send this earth into a golden age. Test scores will rocket up just as future space programs will. It will give birth to a faith in humanity itself. People will be much more serious about journeying into the unknown of space. They&#39;ve been &quot;drip feeding&quot; us these ideas for years now, society is ready for this announcement. The economic boom that&#39;ll follow will give wealth and jobs to so many. I want to see that world. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all still very hypothetical, if our world governments have been consulting with peaceful extraterrestrial beings. </p>
