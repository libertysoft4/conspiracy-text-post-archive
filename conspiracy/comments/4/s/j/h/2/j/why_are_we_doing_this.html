<p>Sure, more people are getting disillusioned and waking up to corruption. But nothing tangible has come of that. Just more disillusioned people posting their frustrations and theories on message boards.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing this for years and it&#39;s only brought me fear and frustration. The world is and has been spinning out of any sensible direction. I don&#39;t see things moving anywhere pleasant.</p>

<p>As more people wake up, I fear that even more are burying their heads deeper in the sand. I can&#39;t have meaningful conversations anymore. I feel increasingly alienated.</p>

<p>So what do we do? I think we all know that revolution isn&#39;t going to happen. Some heroic coalition of militias starring Chuck Norris and the Rock aren&#39;t going to take down the Reptilian Powers That Be. So why do we do this? Why do we bother?</p>

<p>I want to live a normal life, not one where inanity and lunacy and hyperreality blur the lines of authentic human life. I want to be happy. I want to breathe fresh air. To eat real food. To enjoy the sunshine and ocean waters without fear of radiation.</p>

<p>Is that too much to ask?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all boils down to this life being a senseless struggle from the get-go. Humans are violent, deceitful creatures who are way too self-aware and need constant distractions which can only be attained by consuming one thing after the other. The prospect of certain pleasures which are way less fulfilling when achieved and the pains we have to go through to reach said pleasures are way greater than we ever imagined. We get confronted with our own limitations on a daily basis, which frustrates us immensely and causes even more pain. Etc. It&#39;s way more complex than that to describe with mere words, yet oh so brutally simple everybody knows this from the moment he wakes up till it&#39;s time to call it a day.</p>

<p>We all so desperately try to hold on to ideals and goals which were never ours to begin with. They&#39;re programmed into us relentlessly so others might harvest the fruit of our labour ... </p>

<p>It goes on and on ... but we do not. We&#39;re accutely aware of our mortality and try to make our relatively short lives a pleasurable experience. 
Guys like us here in this sub correlate this too much to everyone having a pleasurable experience, which is impossible. There&#39;s 8 billion of us breathing, eating, consuming, shitting, fucking ... </p>

<p>We&#39;re too much of people pleasers I think, which is also an indication we&#39;re desperate for attention, like pound dogs, too intelligent and scentient to be locked up, but undesireable for whatever reason. It&#39;s not just us, although we at least know we&#39;re locked up in a pound, which only raises the pain ... </p>

<p>Urgh ... Fuck it. You get the point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all know that we can achieve our desires of happiness but the government has hijacked all of our power to do so and they are giving it to the 0.01%. </p>

<p>A lot of people have woken up this year and critical mass is 5%. If 5% of the population will just fight for their rights, the rest of the 95% will be inspired to follow. </p>

<p>What a damned joke. Its like a victim abuse who is sorta scared to stand up for herself. That victim is the American private section and makes up 99% of the population. We are strong but we are temporarily afraid of taking our country back. </p>

<p>Fight how?</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a massive protest, THEY will use agent provocateurs and the media to destroy it before it gets true momentum.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s armed revolution, THEY will use the media and physical force to crush it into oblivion and people will go on watching their football. So fight how?</p>

<p>And what makes you think 95% of the population would be inspired to follow? It seems much more likely that the 5% of resisters would be alienated and demonized in relatively short order, and the 95% would go about their days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean is that 5% is critical point. Once 5% of a population does something beneficial, the other 95% are inspired to jump in on it. Anything less than 5%, and people get leery or worried or scared or not sure what to do. 5% is 1 in 20 people so imagine if you saw 1 in 20 people protesting. You might join.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Revolution is not an event it is a process, once we have enough people awake things will happen. Ever heard of the 100th monkey theory?</p>

<p>10 thousand monkeys live on an island where their primary food, the coconut, is covered in radiation. 1 monkey is taught to wash the coconut first before eating. Then 10 monkeys are doing it, then 50 monkeys are doing and once 100 monkeys are doing it the entire population of 10 thousand monkeys are washing their coconuts. We only need a certain amount of people to be awake before everyone is!</p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s scary. But in a way, it&#39;s a relief not to feel this pressure to take the media and the corporations and the authorities very seriously. They lie to us constantly. The lofty motives they espouse in public are not their real motives. It&#39;s all bullshit. It&#39;s all about power and profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as it&#39;s easy to get wrapped up in the simulated reality of the Matrix, it&#39;s very easy to get wrapped up in the deluge of conspiracy theories, many of which are also manufactured as part of the Matrix to keep us distracted and chasing our tails. And afraid. You haven&#39;t entirely escaped the Matrix, and the emotions you are feeling are partly part of the programming. Only partly. Of course they&#39;re also quite natural knowing what you know. But you need to get perspective. </p>

<p>Try unplugging yourself for a while. Like, tell yourself: ok, for the next 30 days, I&#39;m not going to go on conspiracy website or do any of that. Then pick something else you&#39;re going to devote your time to: exercise, meditation, volunteering your time, learning to repair bicycles, going for hikes in your area, reading the novels of Charles Dickens or whatever. Actually I think volunteering your time is a great idea. Just trying to help ease the suffering of others in a very concrete way. Whatever you do, just try to disconnect for awhile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hopefully this thought will change your mind.  </p>

<p>Latest discoveries in quantum physics has been demonstrating a type of &#39;telepathy&#39; among people; it&#39;s literally proving a collective unconscious.  You will also notice that when go to reddit, many people will have had your idea, or that when you post a unique idea, it will either spread or show up nearly simultaneously.  That&#39;s because there is something to the phrase, the &#39;hive mind&#39;.</p>

<p>So if you can accept a collective unconscious and a &#39;hive mind&#39; (collective conscious), then you should eventually come to a logical conclusion that your thoughts become other&#39;s thoughts and theirs become yours, to some degree.  The more you think of one thing, the more you start to see examples of it in the world--this is a kind of projection of your intention, attention and will upon the world, inasmuch as it is the fruition of a law of correspondence in reality, that the world is so abundant an operating system that whatever inputs you give it become a kind of &quot;filter&quot; to bring to you what you are looking for.</p>

<p>In other words, &#39;seek and ye shall find&#39;.  Or &#39;ask and ye shall receive&#39;.  The world actually is abundant.  A simple google search will tell you this. Google will tell you exactly what you are looking for.  Do you think hillary is great?  Ask google, &quot;what is great about hillary&quot;.  Do you think she&#39;s a criminal, ask google, &quot;is hillary a criminal&#39;.  You will find every side of every question because you will get what you are looking for.  The world is much like google in this regard.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my final conclusion:</p>

<p>If you want to see a change in the world, you have to think about that change and be that change.  You have to consciously intend for things to happen and get very clear with yourself what you want to see.  This is a type of consciousness magic, which ought actually be as much science by now.</p>

<p>You see:  the future--and yourself, or reality itself--is in quantum superposition of all possibilities.  You get to choose and then the world becomes your choice.  If you say, hell that&#39;s solipsism, you&#39;re right.  It is. Nothing about solipsism (&#39;reality tunnels&#39; according to robert anton wilson or tim leary) precludes the idea that other people can&#39;t have their own solipsistic reality except those facts where solipsistic domains overlap.  In other words, reality as a consenus paradigm serves only as the distinction of what is no longer possible (by solipsistic agreement -- &#39;collapse of the waveform&#39;) with that which is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m amazed you know this information. I figured this out on my end through some epic books. </p>

<p>Btw, the way it works is that all thoughts, words, and deeds of people enter a giant cloud where they are computed. So, if a large portion of the country wants serious change, then it will occur. If half want it to remain the same and half want a big change, it will tally up the votes and give you something in the middle. </p>

<p>We can influence our lives through thought, words, and deeds, but every single thought, word, and deed enter 2 separate channels (the individual consciousness, and the collected consciousness). </p>

<p>It averages everything out. If your half positive, half pessimist, then you will get an average lifestyle in general. </p>

<p>This is why its so critical to focus all thoughts, words, and deeds in a conscious manner. </p>

<p>Dallas has got me seriously freaked out. So freaked out that I think I want out. I&#39;m not sure I want to be or need to be a truthseeker anymore. I just want to live a normal life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Peace sign is consciousness sigil to degrade christianity.  It&#39;s an upside down cross that is broken to show you what they think of Christ.  The whole hippie movement was a psyop to distract actual political protesters in the antiwar movement by throwing out drugs like candy from a pinata.<sup><a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Wicca%20&amp;amp;%20Witchcraft/peace_sign.htm">[1]</a>.</sup>  In 1969 the protesters were tryign to stop Nixon for dropping a nuke on vietnam in revenge.

    <div class="md"><p>BTW, this was what the CIA does.  Eventually everyone will come to the conclusion several have that the CIA is a function of fascist corporatist luciferians who are in various mafias like freemasonry knights templar/malta, etc with ties to the now jesuit run vatican (military catholicism); this one world thing is actually a corporatist coup d&#39;etat on a global scale and all these things they do are in the name of that.  They want to destroy religion or use it to control everyone.  IT really doesn&#39;t matter.  They just want a steady, consistent stream of slaves and work output</p>
