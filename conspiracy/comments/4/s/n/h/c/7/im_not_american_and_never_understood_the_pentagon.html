<p>I&#39;m Brazilian and the news talk way less more about 9/11 here if compared to the news in America. </p>

<p>I never thought that much about 9/11 and after having read a few thing online I feel that I don&#39;t know the answer to a few questions:</p>

<p>What hapenned to the pentagon that day? I mean, the official story. Was it a plane or is it classified? </p>

<p>I remember reading somewhere that the government didn&#39;t release the tapes of the accident for some reason.</p>

<p>I saw some pictures online and (I&#39;m noo expert) it doesn&#39;t look like a 737 landed there. </p>

<p>What is the actual official story on this?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your confusion is perfectly rational.  The officially accepted story is that it was a <del>747</del> 757.  There were cameras pointed directly at the entry point but that footage has never been released.  </p>

<p>The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfield, was presumably responsible for our defenses against this terrorist attack which at the time was unforeseen.  He was at the Pentagon, but he was not working or directing our defenses, he was outside the Pentagon helping victims into ambulances.  </p>

<p>It is unclear what actually hit the Pentagon, but that isn&#39;t even the most important question.  The real question is why the information about what did happened is being actively obfuscated by our own agencies.  </p>

<p>Edit:  Model # of the fictitious plane.</p>

<p>How do they react when questioned about this? What is the reason they give not to release the tapes? Maybe they are trying no to give more press to the terrorists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two basic excuses that are used in these cases of missing footage (and there are many).  &quot;National security&quot; and general incompetence.  Most Americans are happy to accept the incompetence theory but it&#39;s a load of shit.</p>

<p>Rumsfeld was not standing in the front lawn of the Pentagon because he is incompetent, he was in the front lawn because he was complicit.  He had nothing to fear because these &quot;attacks&quot; were not unexpected, and this was a good opportunity for him to be photographed being a &quot;hero.&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is that in America, demanding answers to these questions has become heavily stigmatized.  If you try to ask the relevant agencies these questions you are met with ridicule rather than information.  Americans were supposed to rally together against a common enemy.  &quot;The inconsistencies in the story are irrelevant and unimportant as long as we face the threat of terrorism.&quot;  Anyone with basic familiarity with logic knows that this is a fallacy.</p>

<p>To question these narratives is to be unpatriotic and therefore unamerican, which then makes you no better than the &quot;terrorists.&quot;  It is an emotional rebuttal to a valid and rational inquiry.</p>

<p>Congratulations krink0v, you have seen through the thin veil that is the US government.  You would be a minority here in the States.</p>

<p>What? Not even a fallacy, straight up bullshit. If they are already admitting that the story has inconsistencies, that&#39;s it. Let&#39;s take a look at the inconsistencies for god&#39;s sake. That&#39;s how things (should) work.</p>

<p>What baffles me the most is to know that this is a minority thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want to know the 9/11 inconsistency that bugs me the most?  </p>

<p>The most graphic and unspeakable tragedy surrounding 9/11 is the reports of people seen jumping from the building to avoid the raging fire that weakened the structural integrity of the building causing the pancake style collapse.  Most Americans refuse to even watch the footage because it is just so disturbing and horrifying to imagine that these people preferred falling to their deaths to the hell that was inside the towers.</p>

<p>However, if you push aside this emotional barrier and actually look at the footage, you will discover that the &quot;jumpers&quot; are super human in size.  Some appear to be <a href="http://www.septclues.com/SIMCITY/KingKongMan12ftTALL.jpg">12 feet tall</a> based on the dimensions of the windows they are crouching down to climb through.</p>

<p>This is something that demands explanation for any sane person, but you can&#39;t even bring it up. I brought it up to my GF and she became furious that I would be so insensitive.  There is simply nowhere to discuss this discrepancy.  I couldn&#39;t even convince her to watch the footage because &quot;I just can&#39;t do this right now.&quot;</p>

<p>If you think about it for a second, you realize that either:</p>

<p>a) the worlds tallest humans jumped out of the world trade centers that day.  </p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>b) the footage was prepared in advance.</p>

<p>Both possibilities have rather profound implications.  Regardless, there was an active attempt to appeal to American emotion.  Americans no longer know what reality looks like.  In fact, I think if 9/11 did actually happen the way it was described, it may appear &quot;fake&quot; to Americans, so they doctored it to look more in line with expectations.  </p>

<p>Edit:  I am not trying to draw any conclusions, I am pointing out a discrepancy specifically related to the frame linked in this post.  I do not mean to suggest that no one jumped, or that no one died.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m more prone to deal with the facts, not with assumptions. In this case, the fact is that the towers went down, the pentagon was hit, the government knows what hit the pentagon and the people don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also more prone to deal with facts. My conclusions are based on facts and inferences I draw from those facts. That&#39;s not the same thing as assumptions. I take all the facts I know about what happened on 9/11 and draw inferences from those facts to reach a conclusion such as &#39;it was an inside job.&#39; Meaning that people at the highest levels of the US military-security complex must have helped to enable it to occur, if they did not plan it themselves. That&#39;s not based on an assumption. That&#39;s based on drawing an inference from facts. Saying that the government knows what hit the pentagon and the people don&#39;t is true, but it&#39;s a far cry from saying it was an inside job.

<p>Exactly, you can&#39;t! But I think there should be an order of things. Priorities. I wouldn&#39;t create any theories before seeing the footage. In other words, seeing that footage should be the priority before especulating any further. I mean, what good has a bunch of conspiracy videos done to exposing the truth?</p>

<p>In my opinion, people are wasting a lot of time creating theories and inferences that aren&#39;t always that plausible. It almost looks like they create disctractions from what really matters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve entertained the idea that some of those jumpers were dummies. Indeed, some of them looked suspect as their arms and legs just flailed about as if there was zero muscle control.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t really come to the conclusion that they were actually dummies. You do see people up there waving and moving around, and they don&#39;t look fake. So why risk your life and go up into a soon-to-collapse building just to throw dummies off when there are undoubtedly real people in there?</p>

<p>Anyway, it could be true. Hard to put anything past them nowadays. Honestly, I would have thought this was completely batshit had it not been for the recent psy-ops that are using all sorts of tactics to try to fool people.</p>

<p>The only conclusion I can draw to the inhumane movements they&#39;re making is that it&#39;s just low quality footage. It&#39;s taken from a very far distance away from where the people are, zoomed in to the maximum. When you zoom it in even more with computer software, you see just how fucked up it looks. Regardless, these are real people. The 100 foot tall people all have to do with perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man who made up these theories with the giant man has down syndrome. He made a 3 hour long documentary full of 9/11 conspiracy theories that served as a huge discredit to the truther movement, as they were all debunked. The government is laughing at this guy and anyone who believes him. Using CGI to stage events is the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. Why would they use CGI when they can kill real people with real sources? Airplanes are cheap in the grand scheme of things. If it involves oil for example then it&#39;s a false flag e.g. the BP Oil Spill. Besides oil, they will use real resources in psyops such as human beings. Besides that there aren&#39;t to my knowledge any false flag operations that took place outside America and Europe. In the Middle East they either lie about dropping bombs on terrorists or they actually do drop bombs, but they land on civilians to kill them. Terrorism in the Middle East and Africa is real, unless someone can prove me wrong. There&#39;s a reason why you don&#39;t have acts of terror in Asia, Central America, Australia, South America, Canada, and much of Africa. The theory that they use CGI is just retarded though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should really pause and ask yourself why your comment, an innocent question, was downvoted to hell. It could be because people thought it was &#39;stupid&#39; or wrong or whatever. But consider that you may have been brigaded by people who don&#39;t want the truth to get out. Here in a supposed community of conspiracy theorists and truth seekers, you are being mocked and scolded for asking legitimate questions. Does it sound to you like the people replying to you and downvoting you are as interested as you are in open debate and free inquiry? Why do they want to stop you from asking questions? Why do they want to stop people from even <em>seeing</em> your question? &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have told anyone this.&quot; WTF? That sounds to me like they have something to hide.</p>

<p>The truth, in my opinion, was that the imagery we saw on 9/11 was mostly CGI, including the people who allegedly jumped from the towers.  (They weren&#39;t dummies, they were CGI; notice how they immediately try to channel your question into a question about dummies.) Now, it may be that perspective does explain the giant jumpers that you mentioned. Though keep in mind that the video someone linked to &quot;proving&quot; that perspective explains the problem used CGI to &quot;prove&quot; it to you. They didn&#39;t take a picture at the same height and then from below to show you that it&#39;s all perspective. No. They used a computer simulation to show you a projection of the effect of perspective. But if a computer generated the image in the first place, why would you trust a computer to show you an <em>accurate</em> rendering of perspective? All you saw as another computer rendering the image and the alleged effect of perspective. It might have rendered correctly; it might not have. I don&#39;t have time to follow up on it right now. </p>

<p>I do know that the evidence for CGI on that day is much, much more extensive than just the mystery of the giant men. Don&#39;t get me wrong: the towers were demolished that day. But there were no planes. Many will agree that there were no planes at the Pentagon and Shanksville, yet still cling to the belief that there were planes at the WTC. It&#39;s hard to believe, indeed, since &quot;we saw it with our own eyes.&quot; If you&#39;re interested to see how it could have been done, you should have a look at this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gORu-68SHpE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gORu-68SHpE</a></p>

<p>Here are two threads dedicated to the imagery of the jumpers.   </p>

<p>Here is an overview of research on various parts of this hoax:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;amp;t=477">http://www.cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;amp;t=477</a></p>

<p>And don&#39;t believe anyone who comes along and tells you that this research has been debunked 100x or anything like that. I suppose a few parts of it have been debunked, but much of it remains decidedly un-debunked and arguable undebunkable. And if you can&#39;t debunk all of it, then it&#39;s not debunked, despite anyone&#39;s assertions to the contrary. It&#39;s a good trick: they forcefully assert that it has been debunked 100x or whatever and the work was done by an idiot. Why wouldn&#39;t you believe them? But don&#39;t take it on faith. Don&#39;t take what I say on faith either -- examine the evidence for yourself and use your own power of critical thinking.   </p>

<p>Here is a link to the strongest &quot;undebunkable&quot; evidence of CGI and video fakery on 9/11:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;amp;t=961">http://www.cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;amp;t=961</a></p>

<p>Finally I&#39;ll just point out: at the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t really matter if it was CGI or not. The buildings went down and it was an inside job. The causes and consequences of either scenario are more or less the same. When I talk to people about 9/11, I don&#39;t even get into this issue of CGI. Convincing people that 9/11 was an inside job is hard enough. First you have to open their minds so they&#39;re willing to consider this possibility. Few are, and there are many who try to keep people away from this, as you can see with your downvote brigade.. Why are people so quick to derail any discussion of video fakery and CGI? Well, it opens up a big question: if 9/11 was faked, what <em>else</em> has been faked? And the answer to that, it turns out, is a whole hell of a lot. But that&#39;s another rabbit hole entirely. If you&#39;re interested, I can point you to some links. </p>

<p>EDIT: Don&#39;t let yourself be browbeaten by accusations of trying to divide the 9/11 truth movement. Again, if you&#39;re trying to convince people who don&#39;t believe 9/11 was an inside job using the CGI argument, it&#39;s not the best way IMO to advance the &#39;movement.&#39; But if you&#39;re talking to people who already believe 9/11 was an inside job, then what&#39;s wrong with raising legitimate questions? Nothing. But you are being shamed into thinking there is. You are being shamed into not asking questions. The truth is important, and it should be important to you. At the end of the day, that&#39;s all that matters. Not the credibility of some movement, but whether you, in your heart of hearts, thinks that you know the truth about what did and did not happen. You don&#39;t even have to talk about it with people, if you&#39;re worried about damaging a truth movement. But you still might want to know the truth yourself. </p>

<p>I have watched the footage myself and it sure as hell looks like CGI was used in most of the footage if not all even if that frame I linked is not.  </p>

<p>I am also finding that a lot of events that seem to have no reason to be faked actually appear to be CGI.  I am not quite sure why CGI is being used so often and for what purpose but whatever the reason it seems to be the case.</p>

<p>The one I just ran into recently is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6A1O42oXrM">this one.</a>  Are you aware of other examples of this?</p>

<p>Do you have any theory as to why?  Best I can come up with is that they are trying to blur the line between reality and CGI so that people will more readily accept future fakeries as truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the frame you linked was CGI or used VFX, even if the specific issue of perspective is moot. </p>

<p>Wow, thanks for sending that link. I remembered when that happened. At that time, it never would have occurred to me that that was CGI. Yes, why in the world would they make that up? And all the other stuff, too. It boggles my mind. </p>

<p>I think part of it is just to keep us tuned in to the news. What&#39;s going to happen next? They have to keep the flood of fake events coming in to keep us hooked into the matrix and distracted. And also fearful. These faked events also increase our underlying sense of insecurity. Keeping us afraid is a key means of controlling us, and this never ending deluge of events helps to keep us in that state of anxiety and fear so they can manipulate us. </p>

<p>And yes I think your point about blurring the line between CGI and reality is a good one. At a certain point, they will be able to use CGI to create our reality for us out of whole cloth. Very matrix-y. And very, very few people can even tell the difference. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m that good at it, though I&#39;m getting better. When you&#39;re plugged into mass media for years and years, it really seems normal. It looks real. Then once you unplug for awhile and come back to it, it seems so much more artificial and, well, stupid. Only in the last few months, after 16+ years of not watching TV, am I only beginning to realize the extent of fakery. </p>

<p>That forum, cluesforum.info, has a lot of threads with other examples of video fakery. But before there was video fakery, there was altering photographic evidence of all kinds, not to mention completely fabricated news stories. I am really into the work of Miles Mathis. He has uncovered a ton of fakes and hoaxes and falsehoods and manufactured events stretching way back in history, at least as far back as the Salem Witch trials. </p>

<p>Here is a link to his work: <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html">http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html</a> </p>

<p>I recommend starting with his paper in 2013 on Theosophy and the Beat Generation and then working forward through the papers in the order that he writes them, since his later research builds on and refers back to some of the earlier stuff. His writing style is pretty entertaining, and much of it is just mindblowing. In many papers he goes through old photographs and analyzes them, showing how they&#39;ve been altered. </p>

<p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">I wrote a paper on Gandhi</a> that he published. I also found some weird stuff going on with the photos there. But I recommend reading that paper in order. The context is important. I&#39;m working on a paper now showing how the Dreyfus affair was totally manufactured. </p>

<p>FYI, this is incorrect - the government was given specific (e.g., there will be an attack on the WTC) intelligence up to 9 months in advance, and decided not to act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not as mystical as you make it sound; more certainty can be acheived through deductive reasoning. </p>

<p>In ever war of the 20th century that the U.S. has fought, some means of deception has always been used on the public. 9/11 is no exception. To suggest that no deception was used is inconsistent with a long track record and there is evidence that the pattern has in anyway been changed - the same people are in positions of influence as the other deceptions.</p>

<p>In the case of the pentagon, the footage we have is inconsistent with what we know an airplane disaster looks like. However the damage to the pentagon indicates that it was struck by a smaller flying vehicle and a turbine fan was found in the debris. </p>

<p>The video evidence was immediately seized (from private sources) which is itself evidence of a coverup. As is the lack of investigation and the announcement of the perpetrator just minutes after the incident.</p>

<p>Based on the above evidence the only conclusion I can come to is that an element within the government conspired against it&#39;s own citizens by firing a missile at the pentagon. It&#39;s elementary my dear Mr. krik0v.</p>

<p>Of course my explanation is simplified, but given what we do know, what other explanation do you think this video evidence might point to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, no pilot has been able to strike the Pentagon in a flight simulator using a comparable flight path and speed of descent. A plane flying that low at 500 MPH is unlikely, and even if it did happen, good luck hitting your target dead-on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the biggest alarm bell for me on that day. I was 18 at the time. I thought it was odd that something would hit the most powerful building on the planet, yet there was no security footage, or working cameras, or jets sent to intercept anything heading towards that building. It wasn&#39;t until many years later that I discovered the reason why no jets were sent, with the whole &quot;is this real world or exercise?&quot; thing. For the longest time, I thought maybe I was strange for thinking it was odd and that maybe I was the only person questioning the whole day. I still don&#39;t know what to believe, but I know I don&#39;t believe the official story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you do even a tiny bit of research about 9/11 you come to realize that the whole thing is so full of contradictions and inaccuracies that it&#39;s almost like they  are <em>daring</em> the people to question it. Like the schoolyard bully who is just fucking with you because he knows you will take it, or even if you stand up to him, he will still kick your ass.</p>

<p>I think 9/11 was the ultimate culmination of a serious of issues that have plagued the American government and ruling class for many years. So what did 9/11 do for them, exactly? Well, wars are monkey makers for the ruling class. But the problem is that you have to keep justifying your reason for starting or entering a war. And in a world where we know all too well the crazy bullshit from things like Vietnam, the American public is far less likely to support attacking some tiny little country few people could even point out on a map. So we made a war on terror. A war on a concept, not a nation. And we can keep fighting that forever and ever and ever, because you can eventually conquer a nation. You can&#39;t conquer a notion. Might as well call it the War on Bad Shit.</p>

<p>So now war never has to end! That really clears up a lot of governmental issues as far as they are concerned. They called for war, put everyone&#39;s patriotism into question, and can keep it going indefinitely because we are never fighting a specific nation and we have no real purpose other than to keep fighting. Neverending war. It&#39;s been their dream all along.</p>

<p>The real question is why the information about what did happened is being actively obfuscated by our own agencies.</p>

<p>How do they react when questioned about this? What is the reason they give not to release the tapes? Maybe they are trying no to give more press to the terrorists?</p>

<p>FYI, this is incorrect - the government was given specific (e.g., there will be an attack on the WTC) intelligence up to 9 months in advance, and decided not to act.</p>

<p>Go look up Sibel Edmonds, for one, she was one of the (multiple) people who gave actionable intelligence about the upcoming attack, and was blacklisted for it.</p>
