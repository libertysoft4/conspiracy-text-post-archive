        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a combat vet who has an idea of what it would take to kill this many people as a lone wolf killer, I had previously estimated Mateen would need about 40 total 30-rd mags for 1200 rounds total to inflict the type of injuries and deaths that he did.  I&#39;m not the only one who made the same estimate, others who also have a realistic idea of what it would take to pull off this type of killing spree as a lone wolf are also questioning it based on logistics and shots per kill.  According to the official story, Mateen averaged 3.45 rounds per casualty. That short of sheer killing power would make him the envy of even trained special operations soldiers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dangerandplay.com/2016/06/12/there-was-more-than-one-shooter-at-pulse-in-orlando/">http://www.dangerandplay.com/2016/06/12/there-was-more-than-one-shooter-at-pulse-in-orlando/</a></p>

<p>Something here isn&#39;t adding up.  Average rounds per kill for a trained soldier is slightly over 20 rounds/kill.  And we&#39;re to believe he acted alone and was able to reload at leisure and move around with 80-100 lbs of ammo on his body and then continue his shooting spree without cover fire?  All while not only calling 9-11, but now also claims that he was fucking updating FACEBOOK while on his shooting spree, again, all alone, with no surpressive fire.  What about all the witness interviews claiming two shooters?</p>

<p>Whatever actually happened, you can be sure we were lied to.  Is it possible one of the &quot;other shooters&quot; was misidentified as a victim, or even made a get-away?  </p>

<p>The idea that an AR-15 can shoot through multiple people with one round is highly unlikely.  AR-15 223s or 5.56s are medium caliber rifles and the round tumbles upon impact and often frags, they don&#39;t keep going once they hit someone, they bounce around inside of the person and if they exit, it&#39;s a much reduced velocity.  An AR-15 is much weaker than even a standard hunting rifle such as a 30-06, .308, and MUCH weaker than a high powered hunting rifle such as a 7mm or 300 win mag.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">12</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a> 2016-06-16</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of people creating narratives then running with them over this shooting in particular, it&#39;s kind of annoying as someone who has served as a Combat Medic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get down voted and labeled as a &#39;Gov schill&#39; or whatever, but you can easily trace my username&#39;s digital footprint back for almost two decades to games like Gemstone III and AOL 2.5 if you&#39;re so inclined.</p>

<p>I&#39;m challenging some people&#39;s narratives to try to get them to think before they type stuff out and randomly muse about what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>For me this is a personal issue because I knew one of the victims, but I&#39;ve been a lurker of these forums for a long time now with sparse posting here and there - so I&#39;m not just coming in to try and discredit the entire idea that it was a false flag, or that multiple shooters may have been involved (more likely that police are responsible for some of the casualties.)</p>

<p>The entire OP creates a situation where the shooter was carrying an LBV and runs with it - then tries to compare actual combat to a shooting spree (I still don&#39;t know where the 20 rounds per average kill number came from, I know where the 3.4 rounds per kill came from and I can point out why it&#39;s bogus in a minute.)</p>

<p>Look, a lot of &quot;firefights&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan consist of some guys taking pot shots from distances of 500 yards and more at you or your convoy from tactically superior positions. There was very little close quarters combat to be had in Iraq or Afghanistan, and you have to factor in that these are enemy combatants who are mentally prepared for what they&#39;re doing, that the soldiers and Marines who are fighting back are trained to lay suppressing fire with fully automatic light machine guns, and that - for the most part - a &quot;firefight&quot; in those areas consisted of frustrated guys in a forward operating base shooting their SAW or B232 into the hills where they think the gunfire was coming from while they waited on air support.</p>

<p>Now again, I don&#39;t know where the &quot;average of 20 rounds per kill&quot; factor comes from and I&#39;ve already responded directly to the OP to try and get that figured out. There are other things not factored in as well, such as that full battle rattle is very cumbersome and makes it a lot harder to remain focused and take your shot, your ACH, LBV, and plates do so much to hinder your mobility that it&#39;s hard to explain to someone who hasn&#39;t ever worn the stuff.</p>

<p>But the article assumes the shooter was just carrying an LBV and then creates a narrative from there on how much ammunition he had. It doesn&#39;t factor in that the weapon he was using could be chambered in multiple calibers that have drastically different outcomes from velocity impact and the trauma it causes to the area hit, over penetration, etc.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve then got to factor in that for all we know this guy was said to be wearing a suicide vest - whether that&#39;s confirmed or not I don&#39;t know - but oops, there goes that LBV.</p>

<p>He could have very well been carrying a duffel bag or backpack full of magazines and had enough to where he ran out of people to kill before he ran out of ammunition. The reports on what actually went on INSIDE the night club are few and far between, eye witness testimony is unreliable when someone is in a state of shock (that statement comes from experience as a Medic, it&#39;s not just me pulling second hand information out of my ass), and I&#39;m assuming the guy was shooting people at distances of anywhere from 2 feet to at most, 100 - 200 feet away.</p>

<p>Whether this was a false flag or not I can&#39;t tell you. I&#39;ve seen so much disinformation being thrown around on both ends - I&#39;ve seen people post video of two guys carrying someone with a tourniquet that has what could be anything from a gunshot wound to a shrapnel wound to a non critical area of his leg, setting him down and claiming this is factual proof that it&#39;s all staged and they were crisis actors.</p>

<p>I&#39;d encourage people to remain more open minded and focused instead of jumping from point A to point Z on this one. Again, I knew one of the victims, whether you want to believe that or not is on you. I am a Combat Veteran - I have no issue providing proof of that to anyone who doubts it through showing a Service Connected Disability VA ID with my finger tattoo&#39;s and linking you to old YouTube videos I&#39;ve made with the same finger tattoo&#39;s, under the same handle (I will not provide a DD214, there&#39;s too much sensitive information on it.) </p>

<p>It&#39;s not implausible that the two guys carrying the guy with the tourniquet asked if he was good if they took a break for a minute, or if he said &quot;give me a minute I need to calm down&quot; and set him down. It&#39;s not very hard to maintain your balance on one leg with a tourniquet on the other for the split second all the footage I&#39;ve seen of them setting that guy down goes on (if there is extended footage I&#39;d love to see it, but the only people showing it off are people using it for a crisis actor narrative so I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re cutting it off intentionally from there, or if it was actually cut at that moment.)</p>

<p>This is just one scenario I&#39;m using to point out that arm chair quarterbacking trauma and scenarios from the internet is really easy to do, putting critical thought into it instead of letting your mind race off into la-la land is a lot harder.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people complaining that there has been an influx of people to the forums claiming to have known victims and this being more of a &quot;cover up&quot; attempt - why isn&#39;t it equally plausible that one of the highest casualty rate mass shootings in American history would draw some people who have a friend, or family member, or were directly related to a victim somehow?</p>

<p>I understand the nature of these forums is to be skeptical. I&#39;m asking you do it with caution, because I&#39;ve seen some people here falling into the category of tin foil hat stereotype nutjob rather than critical thinkers and it does not help anyone searching for the real answers with any modicum of credibility when you inflict that kind of image onto the community.</p>

<p>I DO think the people who think this is a flat out hoax are in the minority of those who browse these forums - and I DO believe most of you who are making scenarios are doing so with good intentions of trying to put two and two together. So don&#39;t take this the wrong way.</p>

<p>Just use your heads a bit before you jump the shark with the rest of the wackos. The fact that this event is the most discussed thing on the sub reddit just shows that, if it was a false flag, it&#39;s doing what it was intended to do - diverting from real issues going on close to an election period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of real information (just any information rather) is causing these posts to seem &quot;wacky&quot;. After a almost a week of nothing new to look at or investigate, speculation is sure to happen. I like the post asking questions and challenging knee jerk reactions on everyone&#39;s part. One thing gets posted and it&#39;s espoused as proof. I had even heard he didn&#39;t use an ar15. But it seems as you said that the diversion is working as intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The weapon he used was a Sig Sauer MCX - it can be chambered in .223, 5.56, and .300 &quot;blackout&quot;. Not calling it an AR-15 is kind of splitting hairs, but which caliber the killer was using makes a huge deal in terms of casualty rates due to over penetration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Combat Veteran you should understand the distinct difference between fighting an enemy at range who is firing back and shooting at people anywhere from 2 feet to what I&#39;m guestimating would be 100 - 200 feet away over a 3 hour period with no resistance.</p>

<p>I would think this would be common sense to most people here? I&#39;m a Combat Veteran as well, and I made the distinction between the two pretty early on, I figured he&#39;d have to have quite a bit of ammunition on hand to do what he did, but I&#39;m wondering where you got all your original information from.</p>

<p>Average of 20 rounds for a kill from a Soldier/Marine in combat, specifically, and then I&#39;d ask how you can make the distinction between guys taking pot shots at you from 300 - 500 yards out, using terrain they&#39;re familiar with for a tactical advantage, and actually being trained combatives in a war between that of drunk civilians in a nightclub? Where did you get the 3.4 rounds per kill average information from?</p>

<p>This is a serious series of questions, in my mind, as a Combat Veteran, there isn&#39;t even a comparison between combat and a shooting spree - but I&#39;d like to know where you served, when you served, and what branch you were in - and how you came up with the average of 20 rounds per kill number in a firefight? As well as your source for the 3.4 rounds per kill quota?</p>

<p>Your linked source cites no actual evidence and just kind of creates a scenario based on a standard LBV&#39;s capacity, he could have just as easily carried a backpack full of magazines into the place and had enough ammo to run out of people to shoot at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming a lot of things to create a straw man I never claimed. Clearly he wasnt shooting at 3 to 500 yards. This is more equivalent to breaching and clearing a building with stun grenades. Not assumimg he had an lbv or how he was carrying ammo, but obviously uf he had an lbv it would have made thing easier than a backpack. Also LBV cant carry 40 mags. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked you where you got the 20 shots averaged per kill in the military.</p>

<p>Eye witness accounts said he was shooting people as close to him as 2 feet away, that&#39;s all I know about the distances that were fired that night.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t trying to create a strawman, I was asking you honest questions and explaining why I have the questions to begin with.</p>

<p>Also do we know what round the rifle he was using was chambered in? Was it .223, .300, or 5.56? The rifle he used is capable of either, and they make a big difference.</p>

<p>Please cite some sources for me if you&#39;re going to put numbers out there. There were reports he was wearing a suicide vest, I don&#39;t know if they were accurate or not, if they were it throws the idea of him wearing a chest rig for magazines, if he wasn&#39;t then it was probably a chest rig.</p>

<p>When I said &quot;LBV&quot; I just meant any generic magazine holding chest rig, to clarify on that.</p>

<p>Please go back and read through my original post and answer the direct questions I had, or I can reiterate them here:
1. Where did you get an average of 20 shots per kill from?
2. How does the average of 20 shots per kill in a combat scenario translate to a mass shooting?
3. Where&#39;d you serve, what branch, what dates, who with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it took you 20 bullets to kill one person, clearing a building, you would be dead. I&#39;m not trained in CQC but my thinking is that by that time, you would already be down. It sounds to me that it&#39;s kind of a kill or be killed scenario. If it takes almost a full magazine to kill someone, they&#39;ve already shot you. Now having hundreds of people packed in a night club and shooting at them? You&#39;d be hard pressed to miss many shots, and I&#39;m willing to bet a lot of the shots would over penetrate and hit other people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a Marine and a Soldier who had the training and combat experience to do this and they refrained from doing so, you think there&#39;s a reason for that?</p>

<p>Mob mentality compliance is a real thing. The coroner&#39;s report said there were no signs of trampling on any of the bodies.</p>

<p>The people who died either holed themselves up in a bathroom that Mateen retreated to when he was engaged, or simply laid down and died.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very real scenario. I wonder how you&#39;d react to going from having a good time with your friends to watching dozens of people bleeding to death on the ground, with their heads split open or fist sized exit wounds in other parts of their bodies, chunks missing from their limbs, etc. in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Hollywood Rambo is a fun scenario to think of, but it&#39;s not real life. People being frozen in fear is legit, most of these people had a flight response without an exit strategy so they just froze - even the Marine who found a doorway that was barred on the other end and hopped over to unbar it said that he was screaming at around an estimated 50 people to unlock it and they all just sat there huddled in fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the police waited so long to go in because Mateen had called 911 claiming he had an accomplice wearing a suicide vest pretending to be dead - and other explosives he would detonate.</p>

<p>The SWAT scenario where they tried to breach the bathroom wall where he was holed up, then had to run a bearcat through the wall to create a larger hole, also includes recounting of there being explosives going off that weren&#39;t part of what SWAT was using to breach.</p>

<p>After the bearcat opened the hole up, hostages poured out, followed by Marteen who was opening fire, and he was shot to death. You can find pictures of this entry spot riddled with bullet holes - so hostages being shot on exit isn&#39;t that far fetched.</p>

<p>It adds up a lot more than the 3.43 bullets fired scenario your source created originally.</p>

<p>From the SS website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A BREAKTHROUGH IN MODULARITY.</p>

<p>Even while in the field, you can configure the SIG MCX as needs or conditions change. The combination of the 13&quot; monolithic upper receiver and handguard create a 17 3/4&quot; continuous top rail. The upper is backwards compatible with any mil-spec AR lower, allowing you to upgrade your existing AR platform to the SIG MCX. The AR upgrade kit includes side-folding stock assembly and adapter</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has little relation to bullet usage at a nightclub shooting, but I thought people might be interested.</p>

<p>The following report includes training use, but it is still very high.  Vietnam was estimated at 50,000 per kill and WW II was approximated at 25,000 per kill.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-forced-to-import-bullets-from-israel-as-troops-use-250000-for-every-rebel-killed-314944.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-forced-to-import-bullets-from-israel-as-troops-use-250000-for-every-rebel-killed-314944.html</a></p>

<p>24 September 2005</p>

<p><strong>US forced to import bullets from Israel as troops use 250,000 for every rebel killed</strong></p>

<p>John Pike, director of the Washington military research group GlobalSecurity.org, said that, based on the GAO&#39;s figures, US forces had expended around six billion bullets between 2002 and 2005. &quot;How many evil-doers have we sent to their maker using bullets rather than bombs? I don&#39;t know,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;If they don&#39;t do body counts, how can I? But using these figures it works out at around 300,000 bullets per insurgent. Let&#39;s round that down to 250,000 so that we are underestimating.&quot;</p>

<p>Pointing out that officials say many of these bullets have been used for training purposes, he said: &quot;What are you training for? To kill insurgents.&quot;</p>

<p>Average rounds per kill for a trained soldier is slightly over 20 rounds/kill.</p>

<p>Is the average soldier shooting at close range into a crowded club? Are those 20 rounds actually hitting people? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read this marine&#39;s story about how it is not powerful enough.  It took 5 well-aimed shots, culminating with a head shot, to kill one bad guy that had an RPG.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/01/robert-farago/marine-223-may-not-be-lethal-enough-for-civilians/">http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/01/robert-farago/marine-223-may-not-be-lethal-enough-for-civilians/</a></p>

<p>Even the 22LR could likely kill you if shot in the head, but the fact is many other shot locations are survivable.  A bullet tumbling and breaking up causes major tissue damage, but don&#39;t confuse that with immediate death.  Shot location and a bit of luck are the most important things that cause immediate death. (e.g. striking a bone causing sharp fragments in various directions at high speed)</p>

<p>The most disgusting thing I&#39;ve seen in this shooting is the fact that the police waited 3 hours to breach which led to numerous deaths due to bleeding out.  </p>

<p>By the way, if you don&#39;t believe a guy can run off with his brains hanging out, here&#39;s more examples from a 16-year police officer: <a href="http://www.isegoria.net/2010/03/observations-from-actual-shootings/">http://www.isegoria.net/2010/03/observations-from-actual-shootings/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have personally worked two cases where individuals were not incapacitated by bullet strikes through the brain. One was a man who was walking around cussing and clutching his forehead where he had been struck by a 7.62×39 mm round — the bullet exiting through the back of his skull. At the hospital it was determined that the bullet had in fact pierced and traveled through the length of the left hemisphere of the man’s brain — yet he appeared to be unaffected. Several hours later he developed complications from this injury and subsequently died as a result. None the less, for several hours after this injury, he was able to “be in the fight”.</p>

<p>The second individual was struck in the side of the head just above and behind the ear by a 9 mm round that exited above and behind the ear on the opposite side. This man also never lost consciousness and was released from the hospital the following day. As far as I know he is still alive today.</p>

<p>In general, the location seems to matter more than bullet choice.  (However see below)</p>

<p>Read that 16-year police officer&#39;s story if you haven&#39;t.  </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>The report from a Marine taking 5 shots to take out a bad guy with an RPG leaves out a lot of stuff that takes place in a theater of combat, including those guys being doped out of their minds on opium, how cumbersome full battle rattle is for a soldier/Marine when placing shots, distance, the fact that adrenaline and resolution/being prepared to die for your cause creates a different mentality in a combatant, whether or not the guy had plates on his chest and back that would have nullified the shots to his center mass, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Point being that people who like to compare combat to a shooting spree, or even a shooting spree to a shooting spree, are kind of reaching at straws. They are all unique in their own ways, and arm chair quarterbacking them after the fact is easy to do, but doesn&#39;t make a person any smarter or more enlightened to what was going on at the time of the shooting itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The coroner&#39;s report said there were no signs of trampling, so what likely happened is everyone froze in fear due to their flight response not having an exit strategy and being drunk/stoned/whatever goes on at that night club.</p>

<p>Mob mentality then kicks in &quot;do as I do&quot; sort of thing. The people who died were the ones who didn&#39;t run.</p>

<p>The Marine who opened a door to get 50 some odd people out recounted that he yelled at the people at the door to open it several times before he did it himself and they all just remained huddled in fear.</p>

<p>When you see someone with their head split open, or an exit wound, or a sucking chest wound, or just blood spurting from their body and chunks torn out of their limbs - it&#39;s a very sobering and traumatic experience.</p>

<p>These weren&#39;t trained combatants living in a war zone, these were a bunch of drunk people at a gay bar dancing around and having a good time. I wonder how you&#39;d react to going from having a good time to that hell hole.</p>

<p>320 people didn&#39;t have 3 hours to tackle him, he spent the duration of his time holed up in a bathroom with hostages. I don&#39;t know the layout of the night club so I have no idea what size that bathroom was, or where it gave other access to.</p>
