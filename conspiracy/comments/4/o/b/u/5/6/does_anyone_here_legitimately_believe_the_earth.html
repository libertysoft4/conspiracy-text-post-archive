<p>Because humans are the best classifiers of objects into abstract groups, the world has ever seen. I attended a school that was next door to a massive satanic ritual sacrifice, 20 years ago. I then went on to attend a Uni that has ties to the occult and other &quot;mystery schools.&quot; So even if I never had any ties to the occult/mystery myself, if I just finish my degree plan I am &quot; affiliated with ancient majick/mystery schools?&quot; by default. Kind of sucks, no? Now all of my legitimate research is thrown to the wind because some asshole I never met read a really old book in a dark room, one Halloween night.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A known fact. At that time... how many qualified rocket scientists were there? We stole expertise at an opportune time. We stole the Nazi Brain-child and it helped us &quot;get to the moon.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like we absorbed their organization and became them (though that is debatable) overnight. But hey, I guess humans are irredeemable to you. Once a Nazi, never a human again... is that how it works?</p>

<p>This is blatantly false, numerous observations and experiments disprove both the hollow Earth and concave Earth models.

<ul>
<li><p>visible ISS trajectories can be combined and provide demonstrable evidence that the Earth is convex and spherical.  You can view this yourself, tabulate the results and use them to demonstrate the shape of the Earth yourself.  After enough days of observation you will be able to calculate something that looks like this: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gaSfCST.gif">http://i.imgur.com/gaSfCST.gif</a></p></li>
<li><p>the Belt of Venus is something you can see every day and demonstrates that the Earth isn&#39;t concave.</p></li>
<li><p>here is a video showing how you can construct your own Foucault&#39;s Pendulum and use it to calculate your location on a convex, spherical Earth as well as the rate of rotation of the Earth.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8rrWUUlZ_U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8rrWUUlZ_U</a>  You can conduct this experiment yourself which readily demonstrates that the Earth isn&#39;t concave.</p></li>
<li><p>seismic data demonstrates that the Earth isn&#39;t hollow and is actually filled with a variety of different minerals and materials.  There are numerous resources demonstrating this fact from hundreds of scientific institutions across the planet.  It&#39;s quite surprising that you haven&#39;t encountered any of this in your research: <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Evjd1/earth_int.htm">http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/earth_int.htm</a></p></li>

<p>Here is another simple experiment you can conduct.  Maybe the simplest of those listed, since it&#39;s now very easy to now communicate with people at different locations.  It should help you demonstrate the convex curvature of the Earth very easily, looking forward to your results:</p>
