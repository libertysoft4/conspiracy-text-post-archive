<p>I&#39;m not a flat earth believer yet, but what I don&#39;t buy is the garbage NASA and scientists have been feeding us: that the earth is a BALL spinning 1,040 MPH on its axis, revolving 18.5 miles per second around the sun. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t buy the fact we&#39;ve never been back to the moon since 1976 and that no other country landed on the moon except the U.S. We&#39;re to believe that getting to the moon and landing on it could be done 40+ years ago but couldn&#39;t be done ever since, even though technology has advanced by countless multitudes. Oh and then there&#39;s the whole Van Allen Belt problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a ball because of how gravity works. If it was any other shape it&#39;s irregularities (such as the vertices of a pyramidal shaped earth) would be shorn away by the force of gravity until it once again becomes a sphere. </p>

<p>We have proof that the earth rotates along its axis, with a) a noticeable widening of the planet along its equator because of the centrifugal force, making the earth actually an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere. b) It is also the cause of the day and night cycle, with the sun rising and setting on the horizon because where we are on the planet is currently rotating towards / away from it.</p>

<p>The reason we have not gone back to the moon in such a long time is purely because a) there is not a strong reason for us to go there to get research and b) it costs an extremely large amount of money, with the initial funding for the moon launches primarily being a result of the space race against the soviets.</p>

<p>The Van Allen Belt was surprising back in the 60s, but it was later realized that the impact of the radiation was negligible over a reasonably short duration. Along with radiation shielding and flux maps to plan orbits through the weakest parts of the belt, the VARB is not a large concern to space travel, with solar flares being much more concerning radiation-wise (which is why SPAN was developed).</p>

<p>Space-travel, astronomy, and physics are not hoaxes created by NASA, there is support everywhere in the world as well as academia over the years (with even Newton and Galileo paving the ways for the theories we have today) and it is silly to think that the earth is flat, and that the earth being round is a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Saturn TLI carried the LMs to lunar orbital insertion and robotic Moon landings with the descent stage still left, as if humans had been there, lol...duh.  Astronauts stayed in LEO as not only is VARB impossible to cross, but lifting life support payload that high is impossible, too damn heavy.  Acceleration due to gravity does not trail off very much, nor especially for getting off Moon.  The shit is laughable...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy, go to the center of antarctica, stake in a 10ft pole with your underwear at the top, now walk 25,000 miles around an massively walled area 500mi in diameter until you get back to your underpants. Also, climb over the wall and jump.  If you hit glass and slide down to glimpse the celestial space turtle below, then you&#39;ll get to be right.</p>

<p>Also, this wall was somehow unnoticed from even a few hundred miles off any shore of antarctica.   I mean since the earth was flat, there would be no way to hide that.</p>

<p>Also it would take several years to go around the shore antarctica in a traditional sailboat.  They&#39;d keep running into the shore and having to zigzag out because they wouldn&#39;t know they were outwardly turning constantly.  Surely someone would have noticed that.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#39;m going to mark this whole flat earth theory as problematic (/lol)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I know of no better independent researcher than Silvie Ivanowa. She has taken the work done on the new chronology by Anatoly Fomenko Russian mathematician and other eastern european independent historical researchers and expanded on their ideas to include our distant past. Many western researchers have been slowly seeding this idea of a past civilization such as Graham Hancock however they all fail to take into account the remnants of that civilization and how that has effected our more recent history. This is her survivors series and it is the first time most of these ideas have ever been presented in english. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJk0yT4erxuSEyHu-0wfUQ0WulbjtWJOu">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJk0yT4erxuSEyHu-0wfUQ0WulbjtWJOu</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk about that area specifically but there are science outposts down there. i heard a bunch of south pole conspiracies lately but i just don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>it&#39;s cold as fuck there, habitable only few months a year, there are scientists down there, so we could probably ask some, idk what points to the fact that there are aliens there or whatever. it&#39;s just cold and unfriendly place for fragile humans.</p>
