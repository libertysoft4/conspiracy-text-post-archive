    <div class="md"><p>I googled him and went straight to the wiki. I couldnt find anything holocaust related, could you provide me with a link please? I&#39;ll copy a sentence from the wiki : &quot;On June 12, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a mass shooting. The attack is the deadliest single gunman mass shooting in United States history, the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in U.S. history, the largest targeted mass killing of LGBT people in the western world since the Holocaust, and the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since the September 11 attacks of 2001.&quot;  Seems like this editor has a somewhat narrow view of history.</p>

<p>Edit : He traveled to new york in 2001 to start up an art center? Perhaps the art center the Israeli students were supposed to visit? ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In what fantasy world was there a mainstream media blackout? This was all over the news in the morning, I couldn&#39;t get away from it (sorry, I was not awake at 2am-5am). This was all over my facebook feed that morning too, you are mistaking &quot;<a href="/r/news/">/r/news/</a>&quot; stupid modding policy with &quot;social media blackout.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, there are a couple of reports of multiple shooters. One says heard two guns going off. Maybe that is when he was in a shoot-out with the police officers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The guy was holding the door and not letting us exit.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that guy also came forward and said he did so to save the people in the alley. He wasn&#39;t one of the shooters.</p>

<p>Another person said that the gun fire was &quot;too consistent&quot; for it to be one shooter. Note, they didn&#39;t say they saw two people, only that their &quot;expert&quot; opinion about guns, in a moment of probably pure terror, leads them to believe there was more than one.</p>

<p>But, more importantly, this contradicts the overwhelming reports from eye-witnesses of seeing only one shooter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three the shooter himself is a contradiction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we are being set up for a &quot;Super event&quot; that will happen some time next year after the election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s great you think this, but it seems to be based on some pretty questionable facts, at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Places this size can be difficult to operate.  They&#39;re too small for big events and too big for small events.  Usually they have a run of 1-3 years, unless it has &quot;casino level&quot; decor, meaning someone is just throwing away money to be cool.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were open sporadically and only if they knew they had a crowd coming in from a promoter or a pre-booked party.  Most of the news descriptions describe the event as a Latin night, to me that says they had a Latin promoter in there, that night.  The exterior also looks like they just tried to change the appearance of the place outside, probably because they were trying to reinvent themselves after business had been down.  If a place that size isn&#39;t doing great, they&#39;re very likely only open when they know they&#39;ll make money.</p>
