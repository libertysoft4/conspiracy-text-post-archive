<p>We&#39;ve had time to digest almost two dozen of these types of incidents and they always end up being total hoaxes, but apparently I&#39;m suppose to wait on this one even though there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3IV9wuXID0">ample evidence it&#39;s a total hoax</a> and absolutely no evidence anyone was hurt or died. </p>

<p>Sure, why don&#39;t I just sit by while CNN covers up all their crisis actor mistakes and builds a nice cushy rabbit hole with stories of F.B.I. coersion and multiple shooters for me to waste my life sorting through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the blood sacrifice phenomenon is something different, and is never as propaganda (for ritualistic reasons is my guess).</p>

<p>Here are some good videos are about blood sacrifices:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCnmGWO5K1s">Morgan Freeman&#39;s Grand-daughter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2eklui1k4">Chinx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6u16a_OW_U">Tasha Thomas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbw9iUUMNQA">Jennifer Hudson&#39;s sister</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice the lack of crisis actors. Here we&#39;re seeing completely different elements at work.</p>

<p>If anything, Muhammed Ali was the sacrifice.</p>
