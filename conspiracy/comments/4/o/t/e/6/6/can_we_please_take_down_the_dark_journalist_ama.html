    <div class="md"><p>All languages are &quot;symbolic&quot; to a degree, and &quot;symbolism&quot; is not some monolithic idea. </p>

<p>Crowley and Dee were intelligence agents and there is reason to believe that some of their &quot;occult&quot; writings were, in a sense, &quot;code&quot; for various espionage concepts.</p>

<p>Their &quot;occultism&quot; was couched in the religious terminology of the day.</p>

<p>Considering that religion has much less way over society than it did back then, spies use non-religious language to describe things.</p>

<p>Also, we have encryption now. It&#39;s a whole new ball game.</p>

<p>My original point is that all the &quot;occult new agey&quot; type stuff that is posted here should really go in <a href="/r/occult">/r/occult</a> or <a href="/r/paranormal">/r/paranormal</a> as it has nothing to do with conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re ignorant about these subjects, man. Please stick to topics you know about. A lot of the UFO cases are very compelling. Check out the Phoenix Lights, for instance- a giant craft over a mile long seen by tens of thousands of people. And transdimensional psychedelic experiences, especially on DMT, are something I know a lot about, since I&#39;ve had them myself. A majority of people who take DMT report having interactive experiences with non-human intelligences. Here are a few stories to check out, below, and there are a ton more. And your attack on drug legalization is just pathetic- come on. End the Drug War, stop believing the DARE propaganda. Peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what happened. I, and countless others, have encountered non-human higher intelligence very, VERY palpably during these experiences. The substance seems to be a key to a separate dimension. You&#39;re just regurgitating a cultural assumption based on drug war propaganda. It turns out to be false. Please check this subject out. The have been two formal studies on it, and both have shown a majority of people reporting the alien encounters. Here&#39;s a documentary about one of them, called &quot;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&quot;- <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk</a></p>

<p>You can put on your most smug face, and it&#39;s still true- the experiences are real and involve discarnate intelligence. They&#39;re pretty easy to have too, if you&#39;re ever interested. Hard-line materialism is what&#39;s taught to you in school as the alternative to religion, but it&#39;s almost as horseshit as religion.</p>
