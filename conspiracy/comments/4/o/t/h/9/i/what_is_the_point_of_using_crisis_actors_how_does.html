        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every time something bad happens, I can expect the inevitable speculation that the event was part of some government orchestrated false flag attack. One of the &quot;proofs&quot; I regularly see involves the suggestion that the victims are, in fact, actors planted at the scene. I&#39;m afraid this raises way more questions for me than it answers. What&#39;s the point? Why would actors be necessary, or desirable?</p>

<p>From dummies being thrown out of the windows of the World Trade Center to amputees in makeup at the Boston Marathon, is there an implication that there were no actual victims at these events? Is the government or the illuminati or whoever drawing the line and refusing to go so far as to take real human life? If they are willing to cause real destruction, then why would you need actors? Wouldn&#39;t footage of real chaos be more than sufficient? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the Boston bombing as an example. Even if I were to accept the possibility of it being a false flag attack and not just the work of an angry pair of wannabe jihadists, wouldn&#39;t a real bomb cause real injury and panic? Wouldn&#39;t that be much simpler than simulating an explosion and hiring actors and make-up artists and pyrotechnicians? Wouldn&#39;t all the extra people put your plot at unnecessary risk of exposure?</p>

<p>I find this approach to supporting your hypotheses particularly fascinating and am curious as to why it remains so pervasive and persistent. Why could possibly be the rationale for such a needless complexity? Wouldn&#39;t any conspiracy sophisticated enough to execute such a plot need to be intelligent enough to see the obvious flaws? I&#39;m genuinely interested in discussion and would appreciate your thoughts. I&#39;m not looking for links to youtube videos that &quot;100% CONCLUSIVELY PROVE WITHOUT A DOUBT&quot; that actors were used, since I&#39;ve seen quite a few of them and, frankly, don&#39;t find them particularly convincing; I&#39;m more interested in simply examining the idea or the concept of &quot;crisis actors&quot; and the issues surrounding them.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen people on the local news that I thought were crisis actors. Not that the event wasn&#39;t real. But when the news goes out to someplace, say on the street where a crime was committed, many people don&#39;t want to be on TV, are afraid they&#39;ll be made to look like fools, or they want money, etc. But a crisis actor can show up, often in their car, repeat the relevant points they&#39;ve been told to repeat, and produce a product that can be shown on the ten o&#39;clock news without anybody being mad that a neighborhood&#39;s residents have been made to look like fools.</p>

<p>But crisis actors are at a big event to spin the event the way TPTB want it spun. But some crisis actors can end up victims. Certainly the US plutocracy isn&#39;t reluctant to kill, or even to change a crisis actor to a patsy or victim.</p>

<p>What led you to believe that they were crisis actors? Are you convinced that this is the case or is this merely a suspicion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t going to comment but alllie hit on some points I was thinking of too. With these recent mass shootings we have been noticing an obvious pattern:</p>

<p>First, a drill or training event where crisis actors are used. Then about a year later, the real shooting happens which likely involves both real victims and crisis actors. The actors are probably recruited from the first drill and then used to keep the story on track instead of using real victims and witnesses who could end up leaking certain details on live TV they want to keep suppressed.</p>

<p>I think the drills are intended as a litmus test and recruitment opportunity. It tells them everything they need to know about <em>who and how</em> people will respond to the event when it really does happen. It gives them a list of respondents and officials (Police, Fire, EMT, etc) who would be there should a real mass shooting take place. It generates paperwork that can be reused. It gives them a list of actors they can use as story fixers, if necessary. Maybe these actors get deployed for a real event thinking it&#39;s another drill who knows.</p>

<p>Crisis drills started out as a helpful practice, but as they became more realistic to the point where respondents couldn&#39;t tell the difference between drill and reality, the powers that be simply noticed this and took advantage of the opportunity. Now we&#39;re in the Truman Show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any evidence that directly links a particular drill to a particular even? Schools and office buildings run routine fire drills. If one of those building later has a real fire, does the drill indicate that the fire is deliberate? During the Cold War, it was bomb drills, today we have active shooter drills. Both law enforcement and fire companies run simulations to practice proper response protocols. How do you determine which drills are carried out for safety preparedness and which are conducted with more nefarious intent?</p>

<p>As for the narrative spin, I still don&#39;t see the need for such complexity, even in the event of a false flag. If someone is sent in to a school and kills children, I think it&#39;s a safe bet that at least a couple people affected would want to talk about gun control. The narrative thread is already there. If you send someone in to a gay night club, at least a couple people people there would want to talk about violence against the LGBT community; again, the narrative thread is already there. </p>

<p>Much of the footage I see being scrutinized and picked apart involves these &quot;actors&quot; doing nothing more than passing by the camera. One image that was famously questioned by the conspiracy speculation crowd was the picture of the guy who lost his leg in the Boston Bombing. No one stopped to talk to him, it was just a picture. More recently, the videos I see posted of the Orlando shooting that is being analyzed in these forums are of people walking or being carried passed the camera. </p>

<p>From my point of view, it seems that the &quot;crisis actor&quot; narrative is a simple and convenient way of shutting down anyone who might say something you dislike without having to actually engage in the discussion or address something that might make one uncomfortable.  We could have a discussion about access to firearms, or we can say that Sandy Hook was a hoax and go buy more guns. We could try to understand the complex geopolitics that can contribute to the rise of international terrorism, or we can scream that it&#39;s a false flag. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point of view is flat out wrong. People don&#39;t use &quot;crisis actors&quot; to shut down others. That&#39;s bullshit. This is a <em>conspiracy</em> sub where discussing <em>conspiracy theories</em> is acceptable and encouraged, including personal pet theories. People like to play detective and put pieces together using their own brains, then test them through the peer-review process (such as Reddit) to see how well they hold up. Apparently it&#39;s something you don&#39;t understand at all. Ever watch Columbo, Dick Tracy, Criminal Minds?</p>

<p>I saw the guy being carried passed the camera on TV a few days ago. They played the clip about 100 times. Then I saw the UNCUT version of that video clip here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which showed them carrying the guy, then they just let go of the guy while he stood there on his own two feet with no apparent injury.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be wrong. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time, and I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be the last. I have no problem with questioning the narrative; I just find it funny that people people who pride themselves on independent thought are so uncritical about their own sources. </p>

<p>I know the video you&#39;re talking about and I can see how it could look if you watch it with the presumption that everything as a conspiracy, but I can also think of other other explanations, such as perhaps the victim wanted to try to walk on their own feet. I know that doesn&#39;t sound as exciting as your explanation, but it&#39;s common enough to be well within the realm of possible explanations. Do I have PROOF? No. But I&#39;m not the one claiming to; at best, what we are seeing is inconclusive. You claim the video you watched was &quot;uncut&quot;; that&#39;s cute. Differently cut would be more accurate. Perhaps you&#39;ve been shown just enough to make the first cut look questionable, but not enough to see the guy fall flat on his face after a few steps or to see a medic arrive to assist moments later.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said, in another response, I can accept media manipulation. I can accept propaganda. I can accept that events can be exploited or commandeered to suit an agenda, but I find this specific claim rather dubious and the &quot;evidence&quot;spotty at best. I also find &quot;crisis actors&quot; to be an unnecessary complication to to what would otherwise be a rather simple plot and therefore, I find their implementation in this way to be unlikely.</p>

<p>Thanks for the conversation.</p>

<p>-Editing to point out that your link has nothing to do with conspiracies, but instead military training exercises, which, again, is not in dispute. Instead of making me wonder, it tells me that you&#39;re reaching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My local stations seem to have stopped showing black or white fools, though, God knows, they&#39;re still around. Maybe they think it hurts ratings.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s time to untether a few things.  You can have people die and still have crisis actors.  You can have an actual event that is real and then employ the media and a few people to appropriate the spectacle for your own purposes and thereby &#39;shape the dialogue&#39;.</p>

<p>Does it help your assumption that those asking questions or speculating hypotheses are wrong to ignore the fact that the media is controlled by 6 companies; or that there is a long, provable history of FBI and CIA agents working with--either directly as in advertiser-liaison or indirectly as in embedded covertly as staff into the media itself?  Does it help your assumption to not know the Hegelian dialectic by which they operate; to think that conspiracies aren&#39;t real (and never are) and that we are all a bunch of tinfoil hat wearing pseudointellectual morons with an iq below room temperature; to not know about operation mockingbird, gnosticism, jesuit eyewashing, cointelpro, or this list of dozens of other <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">psychological warfare games played by the CIA since its inception</a></p>

<p>You imply for us to get a grip, OP.  I&#39;d reply back that you need to get a grip...on history.  And learn how these people work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a bit silly to suggest that people who don&#39;t agree with everything you tell them must be brainwashed sheeple. Just because I don&#39;t believe that every horrible act is really part of a Bond villain&#39;s machinations doesn&#39;t in any way imply that i think that &quot;conspiracies aren&#39;t real (and never are).&quot; A conspiracy is when more than one person plot to do harm, nothing more. Acknowledging that they do happen, doesn&#39;t mean that I have to buy the premise that literally everything has to fit into a convoluted narrative.</p>

<p>No one is claiming that the media doesn&#39;t have an agenda, nor is anyone claiming that the narrative can&#39;t be or isn&#39;t being manipulated; of course, that happens in many ways such as editoralizing, editing, sensationalizing, etc. Showing footage of the crisis is, itself, a part of that. I just don&#39;t see what an actor pretending to be traumatized can add to a scene of real people who are traumatized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to think it is a mix of crisis actors and real victims of a real event. This helps push the gun control propoganda in the early days, when real victims and families are not thinking about gun control.  It also could be used to bait the truth community and discredit them with the real victims.  I think you have to assume the engineers of these events are a step ahead, even if sometimes their technicians get sloppy in the field. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it conceivable that there might actually be some victims of gun violence who decide afterwards, that something should be done about guns? After all, don&#39;t we frequently see people who are affected by cancer become more vocal about cancer research and prevention? Sometimes when people are affected by a thing, they become more involved with advocacy work concerning that thing. Naturally, that doesn&#39;t imply that everyone involved will take up the call, but even on the media we get people on both sides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Wikipedia for reference:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Denial — The first reaction is denial. In this stage individuals believe the diagnosis is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Anger — When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: &quot;Why me? It&#39;s not fair!&quot;; &quot;How can this happen to me?&quot;; &#39;&quot;Who is to blame?&quot;; &quot;Why would this happen?&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Bargaining — The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>Depression — &quot;I&#39;m so sad, why bother with anything?&quot;; &quot;I&#39;m going to die soon, so what&#39;s the point?&quot;; &quot;I miss my loved one, why go on?&quot; During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their mortality. In this state, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time mournful and sullen.</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptance — &quot;It&#39;s going to be okay.&quot;; &quot;I can&#39;t fight it, I may as well prepare for it.&quot; In this last stage, individuals embrace mortality or inevitable future, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. People dying may precede the survivors in this state, which typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable condition of emotions.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wrestling with the theory about using crisis actors as well.</p>

<p>Statements like THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF are thrown around quite easily.</p>

<p>Even though there&#39;s usually various videos and lots of victims, family, friends and survivors that were effected by the incident. Plus, all of the various law enforcement agencies and emergency workers, doctors, nurses and hospital staff. Plus, coroner and mortuary workers. </p>

<p>People are going to be a part of the cover up all the way to the funerals and beyond. A crisis actor is a job that lasts for the rest of the crisis actors life. </p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t make sense to fake something that is this complex. The chances of getting everything right on the first and only take are astronomical. </p>

<p>You mentioned that you didn&#39;t want to see any links to any of those videos claiming that they have absolute proof that an event was hoaxed.</p>

<p>Did you know that whomever uploads a video on YouTube makes money for the views that the video gets? It&#39;s probably not a whole lot but they all add up. Plus, if you upload a video once you can collect from it for the rest of your life. Pretty sweet deal... </p>

<p>Reaction videos was a big thing that caught my attention a few months ago. People are uploading a ton of videos where they are making comments about other peoples videos. It&#39;s a pretty competitive field. Lots of different channels fighting for attention. </p>

<p>So if there&#39;s money to be made by getting people to view your upload then click bait titles like 100% proof Orlando Shooting is a Hoax are a literal gold mine in the long run. </p>

<p>Hoax and conspiracy videos have been floating around for pretty much every big event for quite a long time. And, you&#39;re right, they do seem to be bullshit.</p>

<p>Obviously, the guy is just trying to make something seem like it looks fake. He&#39;s putting his own spin on it trying to convince people that he&#39;s an authority on the subject and that he&#39;s giving them the truth.</p>

<p>So how do these unscrupulous YouTubeers get people to view their videos rather than letting Google bring viewers through search? Social Media. Especially open forum like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. All they gotta do is drop a few links and talk a little shit. Pretty soon it&#39;s got a life of its own. </p>

<p>Just presenting a theory. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t done any real research on the idea. In fact, I just came up with the idea a couple of hours ago.</p>

<p>It does kinda make sense though. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy for me to believe that some of these &quot;true believers&quot; who are so stubborn to believe their outlandish theories no matter what evidence is presented are just video bloggers trying to cash in. </p>

<p>One way I came up with the idea is that I noticed that one of the recent Orlando hoax videos was posted by an account that was only 5 days old. In fact, 2 of their posts were videos and several posts were in support of the videos. </p>

<p>Did you know that whomever uploads a video on YouTube makes money for the views that the video gets? It&#39;s probably not a whole lot but they all add up. Plus, if you upload a video once you can collect from it for the rest of your life. Pretty sweet deal...</p>

<p>Reaction videos was a big thing that caught my attention a few months ago. People are uploading a ton of videos where they are making comments about other peoples videos. It&#39;s a pretty competitive field. Lots of different channels fighting for attention.</p>

<p>So if there&#39;s money to be made by getting people to view your upload then click bait titles like 100% proof Orlando Shooting is a Hoax are a literal gold mine in the long run.</p>

<p>Hoax and conspiracy videos have been floating around for pretty much every big event for quite a long time. And, you&#39;re right, they do seem to be bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup. Notice no one ever questions the profit motive or tactics used by the click-bait press.</p>

<p>*Sensational headline: Check</p>

<p>*Video or quote that is heavily edited to highlight the parts that fit your narrative: Check</p>

<p>*Lots of speculation telling you how to interpret spotty or ambiguous information: Check</p>

<p>*Questionable sources: Check</p>

<p>*Everyone who disagrees is is either corrupt or brainwashed:  Check</p>

<p>If it confirms your narrative, you don&#39;t need to subject it to as much scrutiny; if it contradicts your narrative, then it&#39;s an evil lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certain cases, such as Sandy Hook, the risk of eventually being caught makes it a much better option to fake it. </p>

<p>Put it this way, if you have a goal you want to complete and you can do it without killing people - why would you kill people? </p>

<p>Second, because the goal is a &quot;good intention&quot;, for example to ban dangerous guns to make America safe, then participants in the conspiracy have no problem going along with it. Where as if you&#39;re going to kill people you need to have only professionals on the team. And who then deals with news etc? </p>

<p>Lastly, when it comes to faking it, real victims have real questions and they&#39;re persistent. What people tend to forget is 911 victims families caused ALOT of disclosure and investigation the government originally wanted to ignore. So in Sandy hook if you really had parents of 30 dead kids there&#39;s too much risk. </p>

<p>Therefore using actors to convey a manufactured narrative is effective, simple, and low risk. If the event was somehow blown wide open in the future, it can be blamed on trying to complete a noble goal. </p>

<p>Every single Sandy hook parent is completely full of shit in every video. Imo Sandy hook was the first truly conclusive case of actor use. And many of the parents were literal actors or involved in production in some way in their real lives. </p>

<p>But doesn&#39;t the scale of such an illusion make it much more likely that you&#39;ll be exposed? Alternatively, we have a single shooter waking into a building and killing themselves before being captured, what risk is there that anyone else would be implicated? It&#39;s so neatly wrapped up, it&#39;s practically got a bow on it. </p>

<p>That sounds like a pretty banal evil that is unwilling to break a few eggs.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I find this part particularly confusing. Would professionals be needed to assist in pulling off such a large-scale hoax? You ask who would deal with the news if there were real victims, but it seems to me that a hoax would require total coordination with the media. What professionals would be needed if I sent in some depressed loose cannon and let things play out naturally? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Too much risk of what? </p>

<p>What lead you to the conclusion that the victims were actors?</p>

<p>I think we have very different interpretations of &quot;irrefutable.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you interviewed people/family members after an event like this and they all said we all need to have concealed carry permits and ban muslms and close gay bars, you would have a very different narrative. The media would have to report this or report nothing. Instead we have a few well placed &quot;victims&quot; to call for less guns, more laws and more rainbows. They were over 100 victims, but I can only recall a handful of people interviewed.</p>

<p>My answer is that an actor can help direct the narrative. IF this is a false flag, and IF there are actors, they appear to pushing an agenda in support of, LGBTQ agenda, the gun control agenda and the immigrant agenda. </p>

<p>If you have no agenda and it isn&#39;t a false flag then you don&#39;t need actors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t going to comment but alllie hit on some points I was thinking of too. With these recent mass shootings we have been noticing an obvious pattern:</p>

<p>First, a drill or training event where crisis actors are used. Then about a year later, the real shooting happens which likely involves both real victims and crisis actors. The actors are probably recruited from the first drill and then used to keep the story on track instead of using real victims and witnesses who could end up leaking certain details on live TV they want to keep suppressed.</p>

<p>I think the drills are intended as a litmus test and recruitment opportunity. It tells them everything they need to know about <em>who and how</em> people will respond to the event when it really does happen. It gives them a list of respondents and officials (Police, Fire, EMT, etc) who would be there should a real mass shooting take place. It generates paperwork that can be reused. It gives them a list of actors they can use as story fixers, if necessary. Maybe these actors get deployed for a real event thinking it&#39;s another drill who knows.</p>

<p>Crisis drills started out as a helpful practice, but as they became more realistic to the point where respondents couldn&#39;t tell the difference between drill and reality, the powers that be simply noticed this and took advantage of the opportunity. Now we&#39;re in the Truman Show.</p>
