    <div class="md"><p>Norm there is actually correct in their argument but you just rolled through their argument without really accepting their position.</p>

<p>All they were saying is that we should be pushing for potentially dangerous vaccines to be removed from the market and replaced with a less dangerous alternative.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t feel safe giving some of these vaccines to their children due to the ingredients and KNOWN RISKS associated with these NON ESSENTIAL poisons.</p>

<p>Arguing with someone by comparing the vaccine with the potential disease is creating a false comparison. The comparison should be a vaccine without harmful ingredients. Since there are vaccines on the market that don&#39;t require mercury we should just assume that should be an industry standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the random guy is a consumer who should have a choice. Consumers have rights except for in the case of vaccines. This kills the system and results in companies not re-engineering old drugs since consumers have no choice in the matter.</p>

<p>Look at the broadband industry in the US and you see the same issue. It&#39;s poorly regulated and has no relevant competition. Consumers have no buying power since there&#39;s no alternative and the laws don&#39;t support them.</p>

<p>So the broadband industry has old data lines and worse performance than most modern countries while still overcharging the consumer for service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying at all. Obviously people who study vaccines KNOW more about the subject than the average lay person. I&#39;m saying we shouldn&#39;t just blindly trust the experts, having been mislead and lied to so many times. It&#39;s pretty clear that the FDA is corrupt and the pharmaceutical industry has shown time and time again that they care much more about profits than they do about making products that don&#39;t cause harm to the people they&#39;re sold to. I&#39;m not claiming to be an expert but I am adamantly against the idea of being told to just &quot;trust the science.&quot;</p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t be there if they weren&#39;t essential. Some vaccines don&#39;t need them as preservatives, so they don&#39;t have them. Some do. As it is, the recommended program can be achieved totally thymiserol free. As such, there is no reason to be anti-vax. Just don&#39;t get the vaccines that you think are dangerous because you don&#39;t understand how they work- those ones containing thymiserol are optional anyway. Norm was saying get rid of the &quot;dangerous&quot; vaccines. The thing is, we need them in the interim, assuming a vaccine without thymiserol is in the works (for those that actually do contain it, which again is not all or even most.) </p>
