    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, this is what I tell all those poster who show up in this sub once a month who are depressed and see no point in anything anymore once they go down the rabbit hole for the first time. There is a MASSIVE awakening of consciousness and questioning everything.</p>

<p>People want gmo&#39;s labeled, I keep seeing commercials about various fast food and grocery stores carrying organic meats with no steroid/antibiotic injections, homesteading taking off, off-the-grid getting bigger, the news about DNC being rigged coming out, people across various groups unifying with LGBT group after Florida massacre, more people getting into decentralized cryptocurrencies, oil countries like the Saudi&#39;s getting ready to die a slow death (By the way Saudi&#39;s own majority of twitter and have bought into Uber), massive uptick in solar/wind/wave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahah &quot;shit winds of change&quot;....Trailer Park boys reference? That show is classic. Yea you definitely know your stuff, man. He brings up a good point, there are little signs of awakening happening all around us, and it&#39;s on a GLOBAL basis. How many European countries/South American countries are revolting against their rigged economic systems and central banks? How many have begun to push back against their corrupt establishments? TONS of them. I believe that the system is in panic mode, they are a little worried that they are losing control so they are stepping on the gas a bit in regard to the timing of their plan. The events that they planned are coming at us a lot quicker, they have to start rushing, and when they rush, they begin to make mistakes. Essentially, they are moving into a position, where we can catch them in a slip up and expose them entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Traitor&quot; is a pretty heavyweight word that you&#39;re throwing in there.  Traitors are executed.  Traitors are the enemy.  Traitors are the last wrung on the ladder of guilt.</p>

<p>Is that the country you&#39;re &quot;fighting&quot; for?  Where everyone is guilty until proven innocent?</p>

<p>Cooper <em>directly</em> addresses her smiling and she offers an explanation (to those who didn&#39;t watch and took this at face value, she said it&#39;s because she loves her son and she could either be depressed or remember the person he was...if you think the only way to remember a loved one is to cry then you probably never lost anyone and are used to a fictionalized grieving process or you yourself have never finished grieving).  If this is all a conspiratorial act, a huge hoax perpetrated by a government with no limits...why do you assume that you can spot the acting?</p>

<p>Everyone here says &quot;hur dur, terrible actor this, green screen that&quot;, and yet do not pause to consider that surely the government would hire better actors and staging equipment.  If her smiling was a goof, surely Jewey McJesuit would yell &quot;cut, you&#39;re smiling like a fucking retard, Larry shoot her in the fucking head and say she&#39;s the second shooter.  Bring in crisis actor #2.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead, here we are a bunch of guys on Reddit who can see through the obvious terrible acting right on the get-go.  What makes us so enlightened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair, but what are you guys doing to &quot;wake&quot; the rest of the population?  The US AND Europe are implicated according to you guys, remember?  You stay secluded in this subreddit and don&#39;t do any activist activities in the real world.  And whenever a skeptic stumbles into this sub and questions ideas, a lot of the time they are disregarded and called a sheeple, one of the mindless masses, or a paid shill.  Shouldn&#39;t you try to rehabilitate those who come in under the assumption that they are probably victims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess but the ones you mentioned, 9/11 and crisis actors are true. I believe, and this is just my opinion, that all theories about CERN are disinfo along with anything space related. Again that&#39;s just me </p>

<p>Edit:  like that dark journalist guy, for example, is disinfo talking about how we have a secret space fleet and this shooting wasn&#39;t a hoax and cerns opening up portals to other dimensions. Also some space fence he talked about. Those lead you nowhere. And of cern was doing the things people say they&#39;re doing it would be done militarily and covertly not by some private company lmao </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t going to respond...but fuck it, I&#39;ll get the last word.</p>

<p>Shootings do happen all the time.  It&#39;s the norm that as the sample size of any group expands, as does the murder rate.  Day to day, murders happen all the time all over the country.  But these average murders are committed in poorer neighborhoods, rough places, the bad parts of town where there are gang disputes, drug addicts looking for a quick buck, or generally unintelligent populations who know of no other way to handle an argument.  These incidents on a person by person basis are extraordinarily rare, but if you take the entire population into effect, it&#39;s exceedingly normal.  Boring, even.  You may in fact hear a lot more than you think you do about murders.  But unless it&#39;s interesting, you don&#39;t take notice.</p>

<p>Mass casualty events, however?  That&#39;s a big deal.  As the number of individuals grow, the more who are personally affected.  In fact, the increase is exponential, as you take into account friends, family, etc.  These large number of people effected, the unimaginable toll considered by a general population that case by case has probably seen zero murders, and the sheer brutality of it make these high profile incidents.</p>

<p>Think of it like this...considering some bizarro universe where...oh I don&#39;t know, this actually happened...what would the appropriate response be?  Probably news coverage.  This is what we are seeing here.  Are we also to assume that alligators are also false flags created to pretend about the permanence which some organisms can achieve on this planet?  Maybe the alligator is a crisis actor, some preliminary photos showed it looking pretty similar to other gators I&#39;ve seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of dissonance created makes it really hard. Everyone that&#39;s a conspiracy theorist doesn&#39;t have much confidence in what they&#39;re saying, it&#39;s a theory so when people call you out all you have are these videos and clips that kinda show that something&#39;s off but at the same time is easily written. Politicians say one thing and do another. Do you not feel an uneasy feeling when you hear politicians talk? Like there&#39;s something off or maybe theyre not being truthful? I&#39;ve always felt like there is a charade and we never get to see the real them. Most people are waiting. The elite won&#39;t blatantly ever do anything to fully bring suspicion because that would finally rid everyone of that dissonance they feel. So we&#39;re just frogs in water that&#39;s slowly increasing in temperature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly because this isn&#39;t an isolated case. Every damned person they interview after these events is ridiculously happy.</p>

<p>You can say &quot;people process things differently&quot; or that &quot;everyone reacts differently to tragic loss&quot; but you can&#39;t use that reasoning over and over again.</p>

<p>If everyone is going to react differently... why do all of these damned people react the same? There should be some real breakdowns on camera... and maybe some normal sad ones... but we don&#39;t see that.</p>

<p>We see happy, smiling mugs time after time. Enough is enough.</p>
