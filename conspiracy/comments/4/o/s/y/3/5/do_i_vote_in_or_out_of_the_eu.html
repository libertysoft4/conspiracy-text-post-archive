    <div class="md"><p>Vote out. 
1) The world isn&#39;t ready for super states as extreme poverty, wars and climate change has shown. We need to financially promote  worldwide peace, sustainable industry and equality before setting up huge multinational governments that are impossible to change.
2) The UK government is nulled the EU court. The EU president is not elected and isn&#39;t even known to most citizens, but their laws supersede national laws. Rules such as cucumber shapes (yes really) may seem trivial but set precedent to how controlling the EU will become without our say in how to laws are set. 
3) I don&#39;t know if immigration is overcrowding the UK. Look at the house prices, doctor availability, job pay etc in your area. But EU immigration law means that people from overseas are entitled to the same benefits as residential tax payers. In this system how can services like NHS, job seekers allowance, working benefits, free education, business start up funds, pension contributions, emergency services and public transport subsidies (and probably more) be run effectively when non contributors get the same benefits out of them? 
4) IF voting out means we leave the free market there could be tariffs on EU exports which will affect the economy exporting to Europe. The tariffs would take years, at least two, before taking effect. Either the price for EU exports will increase or profit decrease for those particular businesses. But in turn we would place tariffs on imports from EU meaning the UK companies would sell more internally and of course can set up trade deals globally which we currently can&#39;t and the whole economy would be much better off. I don&#39;t think the EU tariffs would even be set up as 1 the EU sells more to us than us them and 2 they won&#39;t want a rival marketplace that would entice other members to leave. 
5) Voting in isn&#39;t the status quo. The EU will keep adding members and making laws you have no say in with no accountability. By ensuring the UK stays independent means we can control our own resources, army and government. </p>

<p>Many more reasons but these are the main ones. I like Europe and Europeans but we need to control our own country by voting out on Independence Day 23rd June 2016</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you find there to be any value in the concepts of sovereignty and democracy, you must vote LEAVE.</p>

<p>The internationalist prototype vehicle to consolidate Europe nation states - the Soviet Union - was a failure and it was disbanded in 1991. No matter, the globalist elite already had plans for a bigger and better political Union, and the very next year (1992) the Maastricht Treaty came into being, and with it the European Union. </p>

<p>The EU would replace the EEC (1957-92) and be run by an unelected politburo in Brussels (called &quot;the Commission&quot;) deciding overall policy for all member states, with the primary purpose of subsuming those states into a single EU superstate. There would be a sham Parliament or a &quot;democratic beard&quot; (the USSR had one too) to hide what would be a deeply anti-democratic system.</p>

<p>This is what we signed up to in 1992, although most people didn&#39;t really understand it at the time. And incredibly, millions of Brits still don&#39;t understand what the EU represents. Most Remainians think this referendum is asking them to state whether they &quot;like Europe&quot; or not. That is not the question being asked! I love Europe (but not the EU) and the British Isles will always be part of Europe (but hopefully not the EU), and I don&#39;t want my country to be ruled by a faceless, unelected EU politburo based in Brussels, any longer. </p>

<p>The European Union is a sinister NWO plot, just like the USSR was. You have a once-only chance help the UK to extricate itself from this Orwellian dystopia on Thursday. Please use it.</p>
