    <div class="md"><p>The original number of the beast was 616. <a href="http://knowledgenuts.com/2013/08/12/the-devils-number-is-not-666/">http://knowledgenuts.com/2013/08/12/the-devils-number-is-not-666/</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast</a></p>

<p>So really, if the Satanists wanted to use the real, old number, 6/16/16 Would have been a better choice.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take for a moment that even if the real number is 616, 666 still has meaning and power that they gave to it. They use it everywhere so even if the number 616, 666 can still be used as well. </p>

<p>But yea, I&#39;m aware of 616 as well</p>

<p>Edit: I kinda don&#39;t want to argue but I felt I should mention that the Bible is based precept upon precept. In order for this particular theory to work, everything else leading up to that point in Revelations had to happen. There is only one race on the planet that went through 400 years of slavery spoken of in the Bible and that started in the 1600&#39;s. There is nothing else recorded before about it... </p>

<p>So 616 = Roman Ruler = Not possible.</p>

<p>I think a lot of us more enlightened realize this. If the most powerful people in the world seem surrounded by the idea, it&#39;s only logical that they believe the same thing from the other perspective, which would mean that the suffering of the world is not without reason but on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive come to realize that this is exactly the case. The hardship and negetive energy that has been in control does not seem like its just the way it turned out. I feel there are spiritual reasons for this as well. A few reasons but one being giving the people a catalyst for spiritual growth and learning. I dont feel like this is the last stop of consciousness and my and others being. But more that this is a stage or a cucoon so to speak that allows our souls and beings to learn and grow and mature.</p>

<p>In the Bible Jesus makes references to the Synagogue of Satan. Last month after Prince died, across the world they were unveiling the Arch of Baal in London. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that, either. </p>

<p>Mockery is easy. And yet....like Proverbs says, &quot;Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you.&quot;</p>

<p>And, frankly, I don&#39;t think anything too big will happen tomorrow. For one thing, part of the success satan and the satanists have had is due to the fact they&#39;ve been able to convince the mass of humanity he/they don&#39;t exist(s). So pulling something big on a date that&#39;s arguably (though not to me) 666, would not be in their favor. </p>

<p>So I doubt satan will be sitting on any kind of throne in Jerusalem. Though you may have a hangover. I&#39;d kick the sauce, if i were you. And I say that in a humanist sense, nothing more.</p>

<p>Best to you. </p>

<p>John 8:42-45 (KJV)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>

<p>43 <strong>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word</strong>.</p>

<p>44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>

<p>45 <strong>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not</strong>.</p>

<p>It was not, because had it been re-written just before the transatlantic slave trade by a white man, he would removed the countless references that the Hebrews were <strong>black</strong>. King James was a black Israelite.</p>

<p>Sir, you have not cited anything you&#39;ve stated. Please remove yourself, I&#39;m done arguing with you, there is no point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gerald Massey, English writer and author of the book, Egypt the Light of the World, wrote,</strong> &quot;The dignity is so ancient that the insignia of the Pharaoh evidently belonged to the time when Egyptians wore nothing but the girdle of the Negro.&quot; (p 251)</p>

<p><strong>Sir Richard Francis Burton, a 19th century English explorer, writer and linguist in 1883 wrote to Gerald Massey,</strong> &quot;You are quite right about the &quot;AFRICAN&quot; origin of the Egyptians. I have 100 human skulls to prove it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Scientist, R. T. Prittchett, states in his book The Natural History of Man,</strong> &quot;In their complex and many of the complexions and in physical peculiarities the Egyptians were an &quot;AFRICAN&quot; race (p 124-125).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even more,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus,</strong> who visited Egypt in the 5th century B.C.E., saw the Egyptians face to face and described them as black-skinned with woolly hair.</p>

<p><strong>Anthropologist, Count Constatin de Volney (1727-1820)</strong>,spoke about the race of the Egyptians that produced the Pharaohs. He later paid tribute to Herodotus&#39; discovery when he said:</p>

<p><strong>The ancient Egyptians were true Negroes of the same type as all native born Africans. That being so, we can see how their blood mixed for several centuries with that of the Romans and Greeks, must have lost the intensity of it&#39;s original color, while retaining none the less the imprint of it&#39;s original mold.</strong> We can even state as a general principle that the face (referring to The Sphinx) is a kind of monument able, in many cases, to attest to or shed light on historical evidence on the origins of the people.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that the ancient Egyptians were black-skin prompted Volney to make the following statement:
<strong>&quot;What a subject for meditation, just think that the race of black men today our slaves and the object of our scorn, is the very race to which we owe our arts, science and even the use of our speech.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing -- and these are little more than guesses, maybe a hair short of hypothesis -- 8/04 is a good date to target. It&#39;s Obama&#39;s birthday, flight 804 recently vanished 804 days after Malaysian flight 804. Kinda crazy, just a shot in the dark.</p>

<p>September is more likely. Almost wouldn&#39;t put it past them to try 9/11 again. </p>

<p>Think it&#39;s gotta finish before the end of September, a year after the Blood Moon kicked things off. But, again, just slightly more than guesswork there. </p>

<p>I do have one friend who I like but don&#39;t trust who has been kicking around 11/11 for years. Maybe that&#39;s the date they&#39;re shooting for. Right after the election. No matter whether Trump or Hillary gets elected -- or maybe too close to call? A near tie, with a 4-4 Supreme Court unable to steal for either side? -- right after election day doesn&#39;t seem a bad target either.</p>

<p>But I have no idea. These people are smarter than I am. Maybe not one on one, but all of them combined plus their computers, it&#39;s probably no contest. </p>

<p>Then again, I&#39;ve got Jesus Christ guiding me. Maybe that evens the playing field. It&#39;s what I&#39;m counting on.</p>

<p>You got that from where? A book...Written by elites... You daft?</p>

<p>Written by disciples of Christ.</p>

<p>For fucks sake listen to what you are saying.... See my comment above. Adding KJV makes it worse, it was re-written by a fuckin&#39; white king to fit his narrative and other secret societies. Research Sir. Francis Bacon...</p>

<p>It was not, because had it been re-written just before the transatlantic slave trade by a white man, he would removed the countless references that the Hebrews were <strong>black</strong>. King James was a black Israelite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The King James Version (KJV), also known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in <strong>1611.</strong></p>

<p>The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade took place across the Atlantic Ocean from the <strong>15th through 19th</strong> centuries.</p>

<p>An entire rulership of Black Europe removed from history and their people enslaved.</p>

<p>It is the oldest Bible known to America and the English language, why does the word <strong>Black</strong> and it&#39;s meaning change in future renovations?</p>

<p>For instance</p>

<p><strong>New Living Translation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My skin has turned dark, and my bones burn with fever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does it sound like here, Job is white with a tan?</p>

<p>Because people are trying to rewrite the Bible.</p>
