        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h2>I feel as if posting this in a tech discussion would yield some bullshit &quot;Don&#39;t worry, that is normal&quot; response.</h2>

<h3>Let me first ELI5 3 things that are involved (scripts, analytics, big data).</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>A script is usually a couple of lines of code that runs in the background of any page (Google AdSense, Facebook Connect, etc). </p></li>
<li><p>Analytics are used to monitor a user&#39;s behavior and preferences to sell meta-data to data-brokers, gov, etc. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Big Data is the science of making sense of that meta-data by combining small pieces of information on a user and building a dossier. It can be used benevolently for Business Intelligence or Economics, but instead is used to spy on people.</h2>

<p><strong>Here is an experiment I want people to try:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Have a tab opened on Google Chrome with Pandora playing any song. </li>
<li>Next, open up a new tab and visit a different website (Facebook). </li>
<li>For those who have Facebook, log in. </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>You will notice that the song on the other tab pauses for about 3 seconds, and resumes as you log-in. At first, it seems like the browser may have frozen, but if you have <strong>Ghostery</strong> installed, you will see a hidden script named <strong>ThreatMetrix</strong> that loads, and causes Pandora to pause <em>EVEN THOUGH PANDORA IS A DIFFERENT SITE AND ON ANOTHER PAGE!</em> </p>

<hr/>

<p>JavaScript should not be doing that. Now, take a close look at what ThreatMetrix is, and you will see how Machine-Learning, Big Data, and surveillance have come together to created &quot;REAL IDs&quot; for your online presence. No warning or opt-out option was ever given, since this was done covertly without your knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off topic and unrelated, but Google Maps seems to know when I&#39;m about to speed before I do. I recently took a 50 mile drive and used google maps to navigate. It told me I would arrive at 6:21. Only problem is I ended up doing about 15 MPH over the speed limit for the whole trip. I thought for sure I&#39;d be about 5-10 minutes early but there I was, pulling up to my destination at precisely 6:21. How did google maps know I was going to speed? I don&#39;t typically speed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have long suspected Ghostery because it caused Amazon to hang for over a minute in both browsers.  To the extent that I had to uninstall ghostery because of it.  I&#39;ve A/B tested this in chrome and ff in linux and yes, deduced that ghostery is the sole culprit.  I thought it was a punitive thing Amazon was doing with scripts that was forcing me to uninstall ghostery (ie: a tool for hiding yourself, blocking 3rd party cookies, etc); but now I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s something altogether the opposite.  Like it was harvesting data FROM my account on amazon.  Interesting catch, OP</p>

<p>I clear all history, each time I sign out, then close the browser before opening a new private window to sign in at the next site.<br/>
I never click, stay signed in, or remember me.</p>

<p>I never sign in to email if I am signed in  anywhere else or sign in anywhere else if I have signed in to email. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems very inconvenient. Unless you&#39;re also changing your MAC address through each session, using VPNs, and encryption, you really aren&#39;t doing much. Signing in doesn&#39;t mean anything, when Facebook has a dossier of people who never even signed up. The browser you use doesn&#39;t get fooled by signing out of a website, and signing in to a different one. It knows you&#39;re on the same session.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t seem to happen for me, but the kicker would be if you could prove this ThreatMetrix script is actually firing some Javascript code to interact with the Pandora player, such as specifically clicking Pause/Play via code, or if some other factor is causing the pause. And I don&#39;t see <em>why</em> they&#39;d need to pause Pandora...what does that help them obtain?</p>

<p>Good find on ThreatMetrix though, seems pretty interesting and also an invasion of privacy because they could turn around and sell the identities + tracking services to the highest bidder, or if they get hacked someone could get your &quot;profile&quot;, or if they go under they could sell off their assets including your &quot;profile&quot; to some other entity.</p>

<p>This information should be ours, and companies should be paying us for it. When did I opt in? The moment I fired up a browser, that&#39;s when. The internet is still the wild west, you don&#39;t know what they&#39;ll come up with next, so better get used to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I should have clarified. I am a web developer, and when we write JavaScript, we write it for the page that the user is on, or we reference it via a link in the script. For blatantly obvious reasons, the script on Company A&#39;s website, should not affect the script on Company B&#39;s website. That in an unauthorized data breach if unknown to Company B. It appears as if the script for ThreatMetrix scans the other tabs/websites for authentication purposes (ie: same email on Pandora and Facebook). The company admits that it IDs your devices as well, so I&#39;m guessing it keeps a DB with numbers such as MAC Addresses, IP addresses, emails, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have a look at <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/cross-window-messaging-with-html-5-postmessage">cross window messaging</a>. Particularly the second security note which states it is actually possible to execute a script cross window (cross tab) by not sanitizing the message. This leads me to think ThreatMatrix does have some very cutting edge threat detection capabilities.</p>

<p>And if using IPv6, it <em>may</em> be possible to extract a MAC address from it, but I&#39;d wager they&#39;ve got other methods for identifying devices such as doing a browser capability check, canvas font draw, gathering OS version, driver versions from WebGL, etc. These properties will be very different across devices and can be used to generate a unique fingerprint.</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re talking about privacy, the little stuff you leave around on reddit can easily be pulled into a profile, such as how you mentioned that you&#39;re a web developer. Avoid being one person. Be many people. Are you a web developer? That&#39;s cool! Just remember you&#39;re also a mechanic. And a Starbucks clerk. And a professional researcher. You live in California but you also live in Maryland and North Dakota. You vacation to the Netherlands every other year :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When IoT becomes as pervasive as mobile, you will begin to see how powerful Big Data is. I was interested in investing in companies such as Recorded Future for this very reason. I saw the next big thing, and as a futurist, I knew that Machine-Learning, and IoT MEMs, could act as a global sensory system for a super-organism that combines AI, Big Data, and Emergence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those people over at r/futurology are a real picky bunch. They don&#39;t like anything questioned, same on r/science. They banned me there. It&#39;s like they steer me around with a board, closing off certain areas until I&#39;m in a box. That&#39;s exactly how a pig farmer steers  a 1000 pound sow, a board with handles.  So like if they can put me in a box here, where will I wind up when they have a record of every second of every day on an interlinked system. Isn&#39;t there like an automatic cruelty that arises when people think they have power? When do they so dehumanize us so much that they have no compunction about killing us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, the scripts are included by the website you visit. If I have a website named w ww.mywebsite.com, and I want to increase visits/revenue, I include a script that links the clicks on my page to some 3rd party such as DoubleClick. Firefox is JavaScript friendly, so I assume that the trackers are effective. If you have FireFox, look for the GHOSTERY extension/add-on. It will show you what trackers are running behind the scenes for any page visit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears to function the same as Ghostery, and the fact that it is an EFF project makes it appealing. I tend to use various extensions with different functions (HTTPS everywhere, VPNs, Adblockers, script blockers, DuckDuckGo, etc). I would try PrivacyBadger if I didn&#39;t already use Ghostery. I guess the Library that they use is what sets them apart, in the same way that an antivirus library has a list of known viruses to check for.</p>

<p>So within a month of working, I started seeing people pop up on my facebook from work under the &quot;do you know&quot; section. And it was quite a few of them. Since facebook is gathering info just based on my location, which is not TOO surprising. Where did they get the info from on where I actually work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It very easy. Facebook uses graph search to approximate your relationships network. It also adds small data such as clicks. Maybe you didn&#39;t add Rebecca from accounting because you don&#39;t know her well enough, but shes cute enough to look at. You clicked on her picture, and Facebook logged it as &quot;he probably knows her&quot;. It keeps a tab on the names you search for. Also, Facebook connect links your other activities and data that you give away when you browse the web.</p>
