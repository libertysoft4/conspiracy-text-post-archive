What did the other 2 got out of it?

<p>what amazes me is that so many of you people have fallen for the scam that <em>you know is a scam</em> - you recognize it&#39;s bread and circuses / theater - but then you think Donald Trump is legit? He&#39;s a Bush and Clinton family friend and campaign donor - these people pass the offices back and forth between their wives / sons / campaign donors / frat bros - but you fall for it when they give you one of their campaign donors/family friends playing the role of &quot;savior of the people opposition to the bad corruption&quot;? (remind you of a guy named Obama, at all? christ you fall for the same scam again and again).</p>

<p>this is the equivalent of Putin&#39;s wife &quot;running for president&#39; against a Putin campaign donor and family friend who magically appears on the political scene to take over the &quot;opposition&quot; to Putin&#39;s wife right when she runs -- even if he wins, it&#39;s still a fake race, and he was only set up to play false opposition to soothe the stupid poor people and make them believe they are &quot;being represented&quot; and &quot;changing things, getting the Putins out of power&quot; by fucking electing their family friend and financier, without any of the fuss of allowing them actual representation.</p>

<p>He just so happened to show up on the political scene at the exact moment the rich needed someone to take over her opposition (the republican party) and co-opt/split the &quot;anti establishment&quot; people - so they&#39;ve tricked you idiots with a fake Ron Paul. If Trump was anything other than a scam, he would not be in the race. He would have been treated the same as Ron Paul, Bernie sanders, Wesley Clark, Ross Perot -- that is, totally ignored and blackballed or blackmailed into not running (which happened to Perot).</p>

<p>in America, Trump will probably be allowed to win to keep you idiots thinking &quot;you got your guy in&quot; (same thing they did with Obama last time you morons) and &quot;you got change&quot; and &quot;you beat the corruption&quot;. You know this is a scam, you KNOW it&#39;s just a management tactic -- and yet you  fall for it when a billionaire clinton donor and family friend is set up to &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton wife?  What does it for you? The fake tan and bad combover screams honesty and leadership to you? It&#39;s such an obvious scam, lol, it&#39;s amazing.</p>

<p>how dumb are you people? you are falling for the same scam that has been run so many times, the false opposition scam. the scam&#39;s job was to split her opposition and prevent the idiots on the &quot;left and right&quot; from rallying together politically to oppose the psychopathic rich folks who are running the world into the ground.</p>

<p>trump and clinton can have a &quot;legit election&quot; because they are <em>not</em> legit opposition. it should be the most obvious fucking thing in the world,  you fall for the same transparent scams every time just because some fucking guy gets on stage (center-stage at mainstream debates by the way, &quot;opposition&quot; my ass) and NIBBLES ON the issues you care about so he strokes your emotional nerve and you fall for it - trump is just the republican version of obama, being run on you guys because the dumbocrats had the scam run on them last time, so they can&#39;t be tricked as easily or as completely this time and they&#39;re pushing for <em>actual</em> opposition to Clinton in the form of Sanders.</p>

<p>TBH I don&#39;t necessarily think Sanders is even real opposition, but he&#39;s better than the rest of them even if he&#39;s staying in the safe zone and not mentioning all the fraud and deceit going on at the foundations of our  instituions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s MASSIVE and widespread disconent among the poor in America - providing them false opposition leaders to control them and calm them down is exactly the type of thing the rich would do here. The poor repugnantcans are especially dangerous because they&#39;re the militia types and they own the guns -- so they need to be soothed. That&#39;s what Trump is. I&#39;m calling it now - don&#39;t be surprised or happy when Trump wins the election. They aren&#39;t going Clinton, they will go Trump. Clinton and &quot;the democrats&quot; are being cast as scapegoats and are being thrown under the bus in a piece of theater meant to manipulate you people emotionally and make you think &quot;you&#39;re winning&quot;. That way you&#39;ll go along with the next war that comes down the pike and you&#39;ll go along when Trump starts sending secret police after people just like all his predecessors in recent years have done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie was definitely supposed to be a strawman candidate. Some obscure far-left senator from Vermont with no national profile whatsoever. No chance in a million years that he&#39;d ever be a threat to the establishment. I think that the Democrats looked him up and put him up to it. Jokes on them.</p>

<p>Trump, otoh, I think, was not sought out. He was just another one of many rich republicans who throws their hats in the ring on a regular basis. And when he started taking all the attention from the Democrats and getting the Republicans tons of news and media coverage, the party was thrilled. But...... then the anti-establishment thing got rolling and the Republicans didn&#39;t react to it fast enough and they got caught with their pants down. Now he&#39;s the nominee presumptive.</p>

<p>Which leads me to conclude that the republicans lacked planning and foresight and generally misread their own membership. Political ineptitude due to arrogance and inability to react as a cohesive group likely is to blame. </p>

<p>But the democrats are more activistic in nature, and generally better organized with regards to their grassroots, which has cut both ways big time. For one, Bernie activists have gone above and beyond to give him incredible campaign momentum. And for two, the establishment has reacted in every way they can, legally, illegally and immorally, to fight off Bernie and keep their horse (Hillary) in the race. Incredibly, they&#39;ve been able to screw Bernie over in so many ways and so many times that they might actually still get Hillary the nomination.</p>

<p>The best thing that can happen for the long run now is for the establishment and the MSM to get Bernie out of the way and get Hillary&#39;s email scandal crushed and get her elected.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be a &quot;Let them eat cake&quot; moment in America. And that&#39;s when the real revolution begins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good point, but if you look at his policies, he isn&#39;t a huge capitalist buster, socialism spreading people&#39;s guy. He didn&#39;t finish wars, Obama care is policy in the rest of the Western world (and a modified version got pushed through) already, etc. </p>

<p>The point is, that he is (or can be) the establishment&#39;s choice very easily. There can be also competition among the establishment&#39;s candidates, and he won. (they went together to the Bilderberger&#39;s meeting 8 years ago) That was good because :</p>

<p>-finally a black president, so we got that out of the way</p>

<p>-a Clinton wasn&#39;t in the White House so soon.</p>

<p>Now after 16 years people won&#39;t bitch for another Clinton (not to mention seeing the rest of the candidates, we will actually be happy) and we will get the female president thingy out of the way, so we catch up to the rest of the world...</p>

<p>The Donald and Bernie are playing a part (making the electorate active and caring) and they don&#39;t even know it, that is the best part.</p>

And she has in fact,   in her own way,  as corrupt and criminal as it might be,  devoted her life to this ultimate power seat,   for which,  horribly,  she is quite prepared.</p>

<p>The problem is that the baggage that has been tied to this quest has poisoned it,   and that she owes more to the corporate and foreign elites.    She would probably serve those elites pretty well,  and would also probably throw a few scraps to everyone else.    But what of the America that could have been?    </p>

<p>By now,  the vision that Clinton and her supporters have for the US should be pretty obvious.    Is this the US that our parents and grandparents wanted for us?   Is it the US that we want to live in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The premise of this thread is great . . . except for one thing: The People in Power require there to be the <em>perception</em> of change . . . as a sort of psychological safety-valve. Because of that, it&#39;s extremely unlikely that their choice for &quot;change&quot; would be the uber-establishment been-around-forever Hillary Clinton. She&#39;s also a member of the incumbent political party. Keeping them in power would not be change.</p>

<p>The fact is: In the modern era, it&#39;s extremely unusual to have an incumbent President step down and for someone of the same political party to succeed him. The nation has &quot;party fatigue&quot; after eight years. For you to overcome that, you have to have Reagan-like popularity [which Barack Obama doesn&#39;t]. You also need a booming economy . . . which the current one isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The reality is: The economy crashed in 2008, and it never came back. To combat the consequences of the crash, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and flooded the country with massive injections of money [in three rounds of &quot;quantitative easing&quot;]. Despite all the manipulation, we have an extremely low &quot;growth rate&quot; and even THAT growth rate is fake. The reality is, when you subtract out the quantitative easing, and the government-related public sector economy, our private sector economy [i.e., the productive segment of our economy] has been in recession since 2008. Our true jobless rate [if you use the original calculation method used by all Presidents before Bush] is upwards of 30%. [To put that in context, at the height of the Great Depression, it was 25%]. We have the lowest workforce participation rate on our nation&#39;s history with 102 million out of work, and the highest food stamp usage since the program began.</p>

<p>Long story short: The economy is in the toilet (and has been for a long, long time. Basically for Barack Obama&#39;s whole tenure--since 2008).</p>

<p>It makes no sense for the Powers That Be to back Hillary Clinton, if they want the perception of change. She represents the Old Order. The 20th century. She&#39;s a face that&#39;s been around forever. And her whole track record is one of corruption, incompetence and nepotism. Because of her inherent unpopularity, turnout at the primaries was 40% lower this cycle compared to last.</p>

<p>The Powers That Be don&#39;t fail to notice that.</p>

<p>My theory is that Trump is the change agent. And that, yes, he&#39;s been chosen by the Deep State to rout the globalists [who&#39;ve wrecked the world economy].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make good points, but the perception of change was already done with Obama. Now with 1-1 fringe candidates on each side, even I am happy with the establishment&#39;s choice. I am not saying this was planned, but eventually worked out beautifully. Neither Trump&#39;s nor Bernie&#39;s success were seen before hand...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say Bernie was wildcard and Hillary and Donald might be colluding a bit as they are BFFs or something at one point.    I would say Donald is corrupt as shit and he is playing on his Charisma to win the low income/votes against their own interest crowd.   Hillary is rigging things with influence from her shady dealings.    She may have been picked as in turn president as Obama got popular and screwed her last main election.</p>

<p>Hard to say with the Obama/Hillary scheming as Obama is not going to push prosecution and has been in the back pocket of the Banking Cartel and friends the last 4 years.</p>

<p>Not anymore and he never really had. He was more of an annoying distraction. Hillary can and will win without the Bernsters. The hardcore ones were never going to vote for her, so no loss, the more sensible ones eventually will vote for her.</p>

<p>So overall Bernie didn&#39;t make a difference, but was good for the democracy play...</p>
