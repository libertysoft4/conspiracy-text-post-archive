    <div class="md"><p>To clarify further, the Lodge (the local group of Masons that meet monthly) is a progressive system of democratically-elected leadership at the top, usually with appointed positions for the lower offices. You usually start as what is called a Steward in most US jurisdictions and work your way up to the leader of the Lodge, the Master. In many Lodges the Master, when he leaves office after a year or two will take on some lesser role in the Lodge in order to remain active. Tyler is often one of these roles and involves sitting outside during the meetings and taking care of whatever comes up (usually people who are late and the like).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you just haven&#39;t gotten to the point where they reveal Lucifer to you.  I (originally) come from a town where Masons basically are the law, and I know <em>multiple</em> people who noped right out of there when it was revealed that Lucifer is involved. And rumored to be involved actively.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m under the impression that this happens at the 33rd degree, but it may be the first step of the &quot;secret&quot; degrees.  My understanding is that there are truly 360 degrees that function as a sort of pyramid.  There is said to be no 360th degree Mason, as that rank is reserved for Lucifer alone.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like selling CutCo knives. Most people think it&#39;s just a direct sales job, selling knives to people door-to-door.  But it&#39;s really a sort of scouting for a secret sales position, and if you do really well (and show a sort of attitude they look for) then you&#39;ll be contacted for a much shadowier position within a different organization.  </p>

<p>This is stuff I&#39;ve heard first hand corroborated by people I know to be Masons and who did not know each other.  it&#39;s something that&#39;s come out from <em>hundreds</em> if not thousands of Masonic whistleblowers.  And it&#39;s something that some Masons speak freely and proudly about.  It&#39;s been written about at length from people who have been integral in Masonic history.  </p>

<p>Keep advancing, and perhaps you&#39;ll see (if you&#39;re being genuine in this AMA and not trying to spread disinfo, though this AMA could disqualify you from being trusted with more esoteric info)</p>

<p><strong>My question for you is</strong> when it is revealed to you that Lucifer is  at the helm of your brotherhood, and is who the Masons have always truly meant by &quot;The Grand Architect,&quot; would you continue in the organization?  Or would that be enough to wake you up to them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two fundamental flaws in your assertions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The degrees of Freemasonry aren&#39;t a ladder. There are hundreds of degrees that have been introduced over hundreds of years, but they&#39;re all over the place. Some are in a progression (as in the York Rite or the Scottish Rite) and some aren&#39;t (as in the Shrine). Some are now defunct in most of the world (e.g. Memphis Misraïm&#39;s 99 degrees which are still practiced in France, but that&#39;s the only place I know of) and some are kept alive within special groups that do nothing but preserve old degree systems. Thinking that there&#39;s some kind of &quot;rank&quot; to the degrees is like thinking that there&#39;s a rank to college graduate courses. People who are doing grad work in computer science aren&#39;t somehow more senior to people doing grad work in music.</li>
<li>You are thinking of Freemasonry as having a leadership. It doesn&#39;t. In fact there is no singular Freemasonry. There are Grand Lodges all over the world, and they&#39;re all sovereign and autonomous.</li>
</ol>

<p>But the most telling part of what you said is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know multiple people who noped right out of there when it was revealed that Lucifer is involved. ... it&#39;s something that&#39;s come out from hundreds if not thousands of Masonic whistleblowers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here you trip over your own story. Yes, that&#39;s exactly what would happen. Basically, everyone would leave the moment that this came out, and it would come out. Freemasonry would have withered away to nothing hundreds of years ago because the sort of man that&#39;s drawn to an organization focused on becoming the best possible version of yourself will also utterly reject that organization if it turns out to be doing something nefarious. I would, and so would every Brother in my Lodge... I see the fact that we&#39;re all still here as the primary problem with such claims that our nefarious &quot;hidden secrets&quot; are plain for all to see on the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Constantly, absolutely.  But I&#39;m going to take the word of trusted friends who appear to be in different circles than you over yourself, a stranger on the internet.  It is not surprising to me that information would be withheld from you in a secret society.  </p>

<p>Like I said, you&#39;ll find out soon enough if you keep at it, or you know already and are being coy.  Either way, just as a personal matter I have multiple corroborating primary sources who describe things in identical manners, despite many of them never having met one another.  Not to mention all the leaked videos, whistleblowers, and official public stances of people heavily associated with being influential within Masonry.  </p>

<p>It seems you haven&#39;t been particularly candid, your allegiance is obviously to the lodge, you said yourself that you aren&#39;t giving away Masonic secrets in this AMA...so I don&#39;t expect you to cop to one of the bigger secrets of Free Masonry that&#39;s kept from a large portion of their <em>own</em> members.  </p>

<p>Again, I know what I know.  You can&#39;t deny something I&#39;ve gathered first hand.  If you are, then I know that you either haven&#39;t been exposed to some of the more esoteric parts of Free Masonry personally, or you have and you&#39;re being dishonest.  I&#39;m inclined to believe the first, but I like assuming the best in people.  It may seem like an impossibility to  you right now, but give it time, and eventually you&#39;ll see.  </p>

<p><strong>To ask that question again</strong>: if you eventually <em>do</em> find that Lucifer is heavily involved in Masonic ritual and belief, what would your reaction be? Would you continue in the Lodge, or would that be enough to shock you away from them? </p>

<p>I&#39;d either seek to change the institution or leave. Why would I bother staying? In fact, I&#39;ve never met a Freemason who would do otherwise, which is why it&#39;s so patently absurd.</p>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;the god&quot;? It sounds like you think that Freemasonry has its own conception of deity, and that&#39;s simply not true. We discuss deity allegorically, but it&#39;s up to every Brother to view that allegory through the lens of <em>their own faith</em>. The Fraternity will never tell you what to believe or seek to modify your personal faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently ended up in possession of a beautiful document, folded up and in a golden envelope. In trying to see if I could read any of the names on it to try to return it, I noticed each signature on it appears to also have a personal chop/ signet stamp next to it. Does that come with levels in masonry?  I looked up a lot of their symbols and just about everything on there screams Egypt exept the Greek writing.

    <div class="md"><p>The symbols you&#39;re seeing are probably Marks. The selection of a Mark is an old tradition dating back to operative stonemasonry when masons would put their mark on every stone they worked so that everyone knew whose work it was (for good or ill, depending on the skill of the craftsman).</p>

<p>Freemasonry uses this custom symbolically within the York Rite degrees.</p>

<p>The symbolism is personal and doesn&#39;t have to be strictly Masonic, it&#39;s chosen by each member for themselves, so you can&#39;t really read much into it other than what individual Masons thought was interesting.</p>

<p>Oh! Then I&#39;m wrong. It&#39;s likely the 32nd, and the emblems will include the Hebrew yud inside a triangle, a pelican with young, and a double header eagle. Those are each the symbols of the various Scottish Rite degrees.</p>

<p>The tradition I was talking about is in the York Rite, totally different group.</p>

<p>If you contact the Scottish Rite, and tell them you have a diploma that you want to return, they&#39;ll be happy to help find the right people. If you&#39;re in the US, either in the South or Western part of the country, you should contact the Supreme Council through their web site: <a href="https://scottishrite.org/contacts/">https://scottishrite.org/contacts/</a></p>

<p>For the northern states, their Supreme Council can be reached at: <a href="http://www.scottishritenmj.org/contact">http://www.scottishritenmj.org/contact</a></p>

<p>Scottish Rite (singular). The Scottish Rite is one of several additional groups (we call them &quot;appendant bodies&quot;) which a Brother can join once they have become a Master Mason by going through the three degrees of the &quot;Blue Lodge&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they have 33 degrees where as your lodge and most others have 3, do you know the difference between moving from a 3rd degree to the 4th within the Scottish Rites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Scottish Rite has a system of 29 degrees numbered 4 through 32. They are like college graduate courses where the Blue Lodge is like the undergraduate program. They teach additional and clarified lessons, but really everything you would ever need to know is densely packed into those three degrees.</p>

<p>Other bodies have their own degree systems. The Shrine has their own initiation (you&#39;re probably familiar with them from parades and their hospitals) and the York Rite has a system of 10 core degrees with many side-groups.</p>

<p>The Scottish Rite also confers an honorary 33rd degree which you cannot just apply for. It&#39;s essentially an award which is given to very few Freemasons based on their work within the Fraternity in general and the Scottish Rite in particular.</p>

<p>The York Rite has a similar honorary degree that they confer as well.</p>

<p>All of this is from the US perspective. It varies quite a lot in other parts of the world. There really is no one Freemasonry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great amount of detail thank you.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve read some of your earlier replies and I am confused by a part of it. You mentioned that the degrees of Freemasonry are not like ranks and that everything you need to learn you learn within the first 3 degrees from Freemasonry. Would it not be inane then to have more degrees?</p>

<p>I understand your defense of freemasonry and want to shed the light on what really goes on to stop any confusion. I do truly feel that most freemasons are good people with good intentions who use the temple as an outlet for just that, however it is very likely that a powerful long lasting entity has corruption at the top. Take for example many governments.</p>

<p>My question for you this time is have you ever asked any other lodge members about secrets or special entitlements in the higher degrees or have you ever had any interest in the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; side of Freemasonry?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Great question!</p>

<p>I think the subtlety that either I failed to include or that you missed is that the three degrees <em>contain</em> everything that you will ever need to know about Freemasonry. But that doesn&#39;t mean that you <em>learn</em> all of those details. There are many a Masonic scholar who have spent a lifetime each in pursuing a complete understanding of those degrees, and if I can be bold enough to suggest it, any of them that you ask are likely to tell you that they never quite got there.</p>

<p>The three degrees are like the Cliff&#39;s Notes to the Cliff&#39;s Notes to the history of the Western initiatic tradition. They can&#39;t just be summed up in simple english because, in part, they are about those ideas that we cannot just teach each other directly, but rather are communicated by initiation and illuminated by study.</p>

<p>The appendant degrees, such as those of the Scottish Rite, serve to help you along that path to understanding Freemasonry as a whole, but you <em>could</em> get there yourself if you were extremely knowledgeable going in.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That seems reasonable until you begin to understand the true nature of the Masonic institution.</p>

<p>Frankly, the secret of Freemasonry (as an organization) is that it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s Nevada Freemasonry and French Freemasonry (well, two different strains of French Freemasonry, really), German Freemasonry, British Columbia Freemasonry, and so on. None of them is quite the same as the rest, and they definitely <em>do not</em> have an &quot;at the top&quot; for there be corruption (or lack thereof) within.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My question for you this time is have you ever asked any other lodge members about secrets or special entitlements in the higher degrees...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;ve been through many of those higher degrees and I&#39;m an officer in some, but sure, shop talk happens in every organization. In fact, one of the reasons that I&#39;m so sure that the sea of odd conspiracy theories about us are wrong (other than the fact that most of them are classic examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance">arguments from ignorance</a>) is the great efficiency with which gossip travels through the Fraternity. If someone set up a group that did something sketchy half way across the state, I&#39;m sure that we&#39;d all hear about it before they drove home. That&#39;s just the nature of social groups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have you ever had any interest in the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; side of Freemasonry?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, absolutely! And there are some great, valid conspiracy theories out there. They get drowned in the noise, but I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist at heart, and I love well-researched, well-articulated ideas along those lines.</p>

<p>Most of them require a deep understanding of 15th-19th century history and the Masonic institution (or, as noted above, the many Masonic institutions), but they can be fascinating. If you&#39;re ever curious, you could check out Born in Blood, but be aware that historians generally don&#39;t consider it to be very solid. Still, I have a soft spot in my heart for such things. You can read a rebuttal to it, <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/reviews/born_in_blood.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Why would a mason want to let the world know their secrets?&quot;</p>

<p>Have I entered bizarro world, where a question isn&#39;t a question?  I <em>did</em> ask him <em>this</em> very question, as my very first comment here.  It&#39;s a legitimate question.  The answer could have been, &quot;I&#39;ve got terminal cancer, and I want people to know what happens.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ve decided to leave the secret society, and I want the world to know.&quot; or &quot;There are some things I can&#39;t really discuss, sorry about that but ask anything you like.&quot; etc etc... So, how is that <em>not</em> a question?  Why am I being told twice now, that that is not a question?  It wasn&#39;t a troll either.  </p>

<p>You see, I&#39;ve studied some secret societies.  Bouncing onto reddit to say &quot;Huurrr durrr, ask me <em>anything</em> about our secretive group&quot; doesn&#39;t really ever happen.  You will never see Skull &amp; Bonesmen doing that, but that&#39;s because they have a lot of sexual rites, etc.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#39;ve got one: Why so eager to tell us virtually nothing?  Why so eager to come here, then talk about what?  Others did ask him questions, and the answers are boring as fuck.  We&#39;ve all got google.  I&#39;ve seen impressive numerology stuff, linked to geographic locations and monuments, crap like that, but I&#39;m pretty sure that topic would just be a no-no.  Right?  Meh, just disregard what I&#39;ve said here.  I don&#39;t care what Masons do.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t aware that you thought that was a non-rhetorical, serious question. Obviously the answer, as given is, he sees no reason to do so. When someone shows up in <a href="/r/ama">/r/ama</a>, they&#39;re not implicitly offering to give you their social security number. But there are very few &quot;secrets&quot; in Freemasonry, mostly pertaining to the ways a Mason identifies himself as such when visiting another Lodge.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t AMA in 2 different regards.  One, it&#39;s not the ask me anything sub, and two, we aren&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to ask anything interesting.  So what&#39;s left?  Google is a far better option it appears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, now we&#39;ve both answered your first question, and you&#39;re still asserting that there are things you&#39;re not allowed to ask.</p>

<p>That&#39;s typically referred to as &quot;trolling&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of how it&#39;s done:</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t asked a question.</p>

<p>&quot;Why would a mason want to let the world know their secrets?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t aware that you thought that was a non-rhetorical, serious question. Obviously the answer, as given is, he sees no reason to do so. When someone shows up in <a href="/r/ama">/r/ama</a>, they&#39;re not implicitly offering to give you their social security number. But there are very few &quot;secrets&quot; in Freemasonry, mostly pertaining to the ways a Mason identifies himself as such when visiting another Lodge.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#39;ve done the same thing as OP. Ask away.</p>
