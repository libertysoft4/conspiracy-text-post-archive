        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Where to begin here...</p>

<p>This premise is based on unified field theory research conducted by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project.</p>

<p>Nassim has a fully formed grand unification theory that knits quantum gravity and relativity.</p>

<p>He does this through asserting that matter is holographic, e.g. each proton contains the mass information of all protons.</p>

<p>Before jumping at this as nonsense, let me walk you through some things.</p>

<p>Quantum theory was birthed when Max Planck solved the blackbody radiation problem by quantizing energy. He found that energy does not move in a continuous manner, but actually moves in discrete &#39;packets&#39; of energy, at the planck length. The planck length is extremely tiny.</p>

<p>From this planck wavelength comes other fundamental constants, such as the planck mass (which is how much energy a planck length fluctuation has).</p>

<p>There are a few ingrained problems our physics has when trying to use this information to solve quantum gravity.</p>

<p>For one, they are stuck in a &#39;void space paradigm&#39; meaning the vacuum of space is totally empty - this is in direct contradiction to the fact that if you sum up all of the planck fluctuations that should be in space, you yield a mass energy of 10<sup>93</sup> grams/cm<sup>3.</sup> This massive discrepency is the largest in all physics, dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416055016/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_catastrophe">The Vacuum Catastrophe</a> ( look at that, wiki removed the article...link to archive).</p>

<p>Another is that currently when we try and calculate things such as how many planck fluctuations fit in an area/volume, we used cubic packed packing.</p>

<p>The Universe does not make straight lines.</p>

<p>The Universe makes spheres.</p>

<p>What happens when we quantize space as <em>overlapping</em> planck spherical units?</p>

<p>First - when we divide the proton volume by planck spherical units and multiply by the planck mass, we yield the mass of the observable Universe @ 10<sup>55</sup> grams.</p>

<p>Second - we can now apply the holographic principle because this would obviously make the proton a black hole.</p>

<p>So we divide the surface spherical units by the volume spherical units, and multiply by the planck mass. <em>Boom</em> we yield the mass of a single proton at 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t ballpark, both of these numbers are dead on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proton charge radius: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_radius#Modern_measurements">.8755 x 10<sup>-16</sup> m</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/widget/widgetPopup.jsp?p=v&amp;id=1da8dd98eeb6ba861e0d978ff3abe109&amp;title=Volume%20of%20A%20Sphere&amp;theme=blue&amp;i0=8.081%20*%2010%5E-36%20meters&amp;podSelect=&amp;showAssumptions=1&amp;showWarnings=1">Proton volume with given radius</a>: 2.831 * 10<sup>-45</sup> m<sup>3</sup></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/widget/widgetPopup.jsp?p=v&amp;id=1da8dd98eeb6ba861e0d978ff3abe109&amp;title=Volume%20of%20A%20Sphere&amp;theme=blue&amp;i0=8.081%20*%2010%5E-36%20meters&amp;podSelect=&amp;showAssumptions=1&amp;showWarnings=1">Planck length diameter sphere volume</a>: 2.21 * 10<sup>-105</sup> m<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Divide them and multiply by planck mass</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%282.831+*+10%5E-45+m%5E3%29+%2F+%282.21+*+10%5E-105+m%5E3%29%29+*+planck+mass&amp;a=*MC.planck+mass-_*Unit-">((2.831 * 10<sup>-45</sup> m<sup>3)</sup> / (2.21 * 10<sup>-105</sup> m<sup>3))</sup> * planck mass</a></p>

<p>Yields: 1.281 * 10<sup>60</sup> * planck mass = 2.788 * 10<sup>55</sup> grams.</p>

<p>And here is calculating the proton rest mass via these same principles but applying the holographic principle (planck masses that fit on surface / planck spheres in volume)</p>

<p>Surface Plancks on proton area with proton charge radius  : 4.71 * 10<sup>40</sup></p>

<p>Surface Plancks times planck mass: 1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram</p>

<p>That is the mass of the &#39;surface horizon&#39; of the proton.</p>

<p>Now all we have to do is divide by the plancks that would fit inside:</p>

<p>2 * (surface horizon mass / planck units in volume)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+%284.7116551*10%5E40+*+planck+mass%29+%2F+1.2804*10%5E60">2 * (1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram / 1.2804 * 10<sup>60)</sup> = 1.603498 * 10 <sup>-24</sup> grams</a>```</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason we can apply the holographic principle for mass can be explained via the quantum vacuum. These surface PSU&#39;s are the beginning of a wormhole connection to another proton (google Loop Quantum Gravity or Quantum Foam for the wormhole hypothesis of some quantum theories e.g. spacetime is multiply connected in many mainstream attemps), all protons are entangled and thus are sharing mass through the quantum vacuum. So there are 10<sup>60</sup> PSUs in the volume, but 10<sup>40</sup> surface ports that the volume PSUs are divided into, leaving 10<sup>-20</sup> to contribute mass locally, which multiplied by the planck mass just so happens to nail the proton rest mass. 
How is this sphere packing accomplished?</p>

<p>Through omnitriangulation - wikipedia actually has a beautiful article on this type of sphere packing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Triangular_grid_of_overlapping_circles">Triangular grid of overlapping circles</a></p>

<p>The quantum vacuum is a tetrahedral geometry. This is simply due to sphere packing. It is the easiest and laziest way to most-closely pack energy. </p>

<p>Buckminster Fuller has hundreds of pages on this called Synergetics.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of more examples of pieces of the physics puzzle falling into place when looking at this perspective.</p>

<p><strong>The ancients somehow knew this</strong>. </p>

<p>This pattern has been blasted on the walls of sacred sites for aeons.</p>

<p>There is more evidence of the ancients encoding &#39;holofractal&#39; principles &amp; geometry, but it&#39;s simply too much for a single post.</p>

<p>But I will say this - The Kabalistic Tree of Life, the iChing, the Tetragrammaton - these are all perspectives of the vacuum geometry and fundamental flowing dynamic of energy at the holographic/quantum level of our cosmos.</p>

<p>There is tons of reading material on the sidebar of <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> and I can&#39;t recommend the two documentaries on the sidebar enough (The Connected Universe and Black Whole).</p>

<p>An entire more technical writeup of the theory can be found at <a href="http://holofractal.org/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1835">Holofractal.org</a></p>

<p>You are it my friend, and the ancients want you to know. :)</p>

<p>&quot;the big bang&quot; has been around since 1225. <em>De Luce</em>, Robert Grosseteste. </p>

<p>A christian came up with this idea to give a &quot;scientific&quot; explanation for <em>the story of creation</em>, and we have been trying to shoe-horn this hypothesis into our current explanations of the universe ever since then. </p>

<p>My point is that popular modern science is <em>also</em> trying to tie into an ancient knowledge mythology, although they might not be aware of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that studies ancient, primal, modern, and mystic religions, I maintain that there is a way to substantiate this as being ancient knowledge. 1 Enoch, while quoted in the Bible, is considered non-canonical and ignored by most. It deals with the era just before the flood, and half angel, half human hybrids called Nephilim. According to the Bible they were giants. Cannibalistic giant stories are more common than you might think. The idea is that these fallen angels and Nephilim taught magick. This would fit into that mold once you understand the connection to Metatron and Metatron&#39;s Cube (2 &amp; 3 Enoch), the star of Remphan/&quot;David&quot;. It&#39;s also connected to symbol magick, sacred geometry, Tree of Life (kaballah), and New Age/TM. I believe that we will see this become incorporated into a scientifically based religion that&#39;s salvation lies in Transhumanism. I think CERN might prove interesting to my whole theory. Transhumanism looks like it may fulfill the dreams of alchemy and make humans gods in power, presence, and knowledge. On the front end, researching such a thing would be difficult because of all the nonsense that&#39;s out there. Having a foundation in these things, and having access to citation worthy books, allows for a plain understanding of exactly what&#39;s written. </p>

<p>I understand why people may want to dismiss any tiespecially to supernatural or godly metaphysical conditions, BUT the biggest players on earth practice evolved esoteric witchcraft. I suggest &quot;Religions of the Ancient World&quot; Belknap Harvard as a starting point. It&#39;s well worth the price which is cheap for a textbook. I&#39;ve talked about the occult to varying degrees in this sub over the last 3 years or so in case anyone wants to look through my posts. Ultimately, follow the money, find the theif. Vatican Treasury is where it&#39;s at (Rothschild). Then when considering the Knights of Malta and it&#39;s tendrils, one can make a case for Jesuit domination through possibly this Pope (Malachy prophecy - Petrus Romanus) and at least one more encyclical. I&#39;m not making antichrist or false prophet predictions, but I do hope to relate a unique time in history where religion, science, technology, and a NWO can be realized. For me, it&#39;s never been about trying to tie things together since history seems thematic in many ways, but when dealing with powerful knowledge, and this qualifies as such, we must look at what history says. You are right in mentioning physics. I am certainly no math wiz, but I do understand exoteric witchcraft fairly well (which this is imo), but I have a humble amount of esoteric understanding. </p>

<p>Another aspect is the Eleusinian Mysteries. This is known as The Rape of Persephone (aka Kore). The lesser mystery (probably akin to Mithrasism in many respects) represents death in an abstract manner. Notice that this &quot;flower&quot; appears in DMT trip inspired artwork. Toltec shamanism pulls this all together imo, but Carlos Castaneda really muddled non academic pursuit of such things. The lesser mystery was also displayed, but in a cryptic sense, with the christening of the tunnel even. </p>

<p>Anyhow, I&#39;m sure that most of what I mentioned is foreign to everyone, but I wanted to throw several things out there for people to look at. I would avoid any website that is New Age or mystic, and opt for experts in various fields of science. If that doesn&#39;t convince you, watch the first five minutes of Transcendence Man and just look at all the symbol magick. </p>

<p>Proclaiming without qualification means stating something without using any qualifiers.  Ya know, things like &quot;Assuming that...&quot; or &quot;Based on this interpretation...&quot; or &quot;It is possible that...&quot;.  Just stating something (in this case completely unproven) as fact.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue against the equations though I don&#39;t think cherry picking some constants from the natural world and applying arbitrary operations and relationships to them proves much of anything.  I&#39;m not even going to argue the holographic universe point as that one is, IMO more philosophical and inherently neither provable nor disprovable.  I will point out that arbitrarily tying it into ancient writings without supporting that point at all is simply fabrication.  All the times people try to prove this kind of connection it ends up with huge logical inconsistencies, inaccuracies in specifics and simple cherry picking of data and examples to try to prove a non-existent link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having read Synergetics, I&#39;d just like to point out that Fuller postulated a tetrahedral base unit of space-time connected at each apex. A kind of aether theory made of platonic tetrahedrons. Space-time warped in his approach via tensegrity (tension-compression) at each intersection point. </p>

<p>Fuller&#39;s is a three dimensional theory. But holofractal would be multidimensional, no? I assume you&#39;re using De Broglie-Bohm Pilot Wave theory to describe the aether medium. And that doesn&#39;t conform to Fuller&#39;s ideas at all. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I just want to point out that although physicists don&#39;t much like it, aether theories are coming back into vogue. Just look at the LIGO experiment. Compare its apparatus to that of the original Michelson–Morley experiment. The null result with Michelson–Morley was used as evidence that no such &#39;luminiferous aether&#39; as predicted by Maxwell existed. Yet LIGO uses an <em>extremely similar</em> interferometry approach, only with much higher sensitivity. Yet it showed a positive result. Which is used to claim that &#39;gravitational waves&#39; do exist. </p>

<p>Gravity is known to bend light, otherwise gravitational lensing could not exist. Since the &#39;luminiferous aether&#39; was thought to exist as a refractory medium - bending light by affecting its speed through the medium of space - and &#39;gravitational lensing&#39; also bends light by affecting it as it travels through space-time, I ask: <em>What&#39;s the difference?</em></p>

<p>Conceptually, there is none. </p>

<p>Yep. He also stated this about gravitational field:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Omnitriangulated geodesic spheres consisting exclusively of three­ way interacting great circles are realizations of gravitational field patterns... The gravitational field will ultimately be disclosed as ultra high­ frequency tensegrity geodesic spheres. Nothing else.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this isn&#39;t the full picture - the vector equilibrium is also extremely important part of the lattice. It is the geometry of singularity and a necessary part of the fractal scaling of the lattice, especially important for it&#39;s jitterbug.</p>

<p>Not multidimensional, no, fully three dimensional. The geometry isn&#39;t in some hyper-dimension, it is simply the energetic interaction between the spherical units that makeup spacetime (and matter).</p>

<p>Pilot Wave yes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can this theory go hand in hand with the charge field theory? I&#39;m not sure why you need quantum gravity, I don&#39;t believe quantum gravity is real. A lot of modern physics appears to me to be complete bunk. They hide their bunk physics behind bunk math and force their hypotheses to fit reality with their curved math and the like. I wish we talked more about this type of stuff here; there is an absolutely massive conspiracy in our modern scientific realm. I&#39;m no physicist, but Physics sounds like a fucking religion now more than a rigorous science. Tell me you guys see this too, so much of it is propaganda. </p>

<p>The actual geometry is a starting seed of 64 tetrahedrons. This <em>can</em> for sure be infinitely scaled upwards and downwards. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not simply packed spheres. The FoL is a fractal representation.</p>

<p>We are looking at a 2d shadow/representation of a 3d fractal.</p>

<p>You can see how the Osirion Flower of Life is a direct representation of the 64 tetrahedron grid here</p>
