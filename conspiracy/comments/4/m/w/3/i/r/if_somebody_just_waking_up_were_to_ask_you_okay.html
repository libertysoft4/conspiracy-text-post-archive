    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s tricky. You can lay it out and tell them brutally but that won&#39;t yield the best results.</p>

<p>I think you need to make them aware of our hidden history, the continuity of power, the hereditary psychopathic phenotype expressed in the khazarian mafia (their probable ET origins) and how they&#39;ve succesfully orchestrated most of the significant events we know about in order to consolidate power. The vatican, the tri-sovereign states, the media, their application of their kabbalistic knowledge to predict our behaviour and deploy technology against us that makes us turn towards our captors for help. Then they&#39;ve weaponised food, medicine, education, science, social engineering all to get us to buy into the illusion of separation from god and act out of fear where we are more predictable.
I&#39;d try to console them that this process, although it seems entirely diabolical is actually necessary in the overall scheme of the universe in order to generate the conflict and turmoil that serves as our material for our spirit&#39;s development on each of our version of the hero&#39;s journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d point to the history of government policy--foreign and domestic.    </p>

<p>•  Torrent of high-profile assassinations: MLK, JFK, RFK, Malcolm X.    </p>

<p>•  Government coups and subsequent puppets: Chile, Iran, Egypt, Contras.    </p>

<p>•  Surveillance and subversion of the homeland: COINTEL, Operation Mockingbird, the mess that is the drug war and its ripple effect.    </p>

<p>Armed with the burden of this proof and evidence, how can you look at the spoon-fed narrative and never question it again. I think people get too lost on trying to dissect or be aware of every single issue of the moment.  Some are very skilled at it obviously, but it isn&#39;t vital to being <em>awake</em>.</p>

<p>Everything. Seriously. Every action politicans take, every law they pass, every budget cut or bailout or even wars, it&#39;s all about making money <em>for someone</em>. Or power for themselves by getting reelected.  And it&#39;s never for us, the working class. In fact it never was.</p>

<p>When you take this into account, every <em>news</em> you see, read or hear can be explained with motive about money [for someone] whether it&#39;s the banking lobby, military, government or private entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Go back to sleep.  You are to late to the party!  Save you&#39;re own sanity and look no further.&quot;</p>

<p>if they still persist.</p>

<p>&quot;Research the federal reserve.  research who owns the media.  then who is really in charge in government.  research agenda 21, then the Georgia Guide stones.  Then go deeper into 911, 7/7, boston bombing, sandy hook.  Then Monsanto and GMO&#39;s, then vaccines.  Also watch cowspiracy to see how climate change is a farce.  </p>

<p>Lots of stuff....but those who really want to know about this stuff will find it on their own and draw their own conclusions.  You can&#39;t convince people of anything unless they want to know.</p>

<p>Voting is a lie and gives you the illusion of choice between tyrant governments.
Media is bought and paid for by viewers and advertisers lowest common denominators.
You are a slave with mediocre choices.  They make people like Justin Bieber so you think &quot;you could one day do it too, if only you have the talent and drive and that one spotlight to shine down on you!&quot;</p>

<p>Just try to escape the system sometime and see how far you get.  The land will always cost you something.  Being off grid is illegal or becoming illegal everywhere you go.  Health care always costs something.  Try growing your own food....then try to sell it legally.  You are limited in chickens and if you want to sell them you have to use a government system to do it.  Eggs can be done...but it just takes one person to ruin that house of cards.  Vegetables can be sold the same way....but it also just takes one person claiming food poisoning to end your fun times.  Just try to get into these things on the ground floor....the egg and chicken mafia have the markets cornered and your profits become so low that one thing could happen and whipe out your entire business.  You could get insurance to cover those losses, but that also cuts into your already small margines only making them smaller.  May as well get an office job and let some corporation worry about it....but then you have 9-5 every day in which you are not free!  You are a slave to a corporations rules who is ruled by a governments rules, who is ruled by laws made by peoplle who are liberal with your rights.</p>

<p>Just remember....government is a cycle of power going around from ruled by all, to ruled by some, to ruled by one, and then back to ruled by all, and on and on it goes.  KEY words are &quot;RULED BY XXXXX&quot;   Get it yet?  we will never be free even with the illusion of being free.</p>

<p>THe chicken part, and the Justin part are only used as examples.  replace them with whomever or whatever business you want.  Same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s start with 911. It was planned before the towers were built. September 11 is the true birth date of Jesus Christ. America (the corporation) has had 8 bankruptcies since the turn of the century and is entirely foreign owned. The elite worship ancient gods and demons, conduct ritual human sacrifice, and operate a global ring of paedophilia and human slavery. Humans have been cloned for quite some time now and all of Hollywood and the music industry is one huge system of mockery and deception, more paedophilia and demon worship. The music industry is entirely a creation of the military industrial complex and television is literal mind control on several levels. Our food and water are purposely poisoned, particularly in ways that weaken and inhibit our own natural abilities. We are free ranged slaves for a select few and we see nothing more than the shadows on the cave walls. The earth is flat. God is very much real. Politics is more of a charade than Hollywood. It is all theatre, none of it is real. Your figureheads are selected, not elected, and the whole thing is just a pantomime. Everything is an inversion, Orwell or Satan, you pick. Bill hicks never died, and he plays Alex Jones now. Michelle Obama is a man. Paul McCartney was one of the earliest public examples of a clone, but the shit they do with clones is mind-blowingly fucked up. The one thing that keeps most of them silent is the fear of what the public would do to them if they found out. You have to be inducted into Hollywood through sacrifice, generally of a close family member. You have to get &#39;gravy, baby&#39; to get into the music industry - basically filmed being gangbanged, a few of the tapes have even made it into the public domain on liveleak and similar places. GB Senior was one of the G-men who killed Kennedy. Man has never been to the moon or even beyond the firmament above us. The sun is not millions of miles away, but more like 300 or so, the sun and the moon are the same size and literally function as a clock. We fuck up our calendars specifically to make it seem random. Moonlight is different from sunlight, and is cold. The phases of the moon are not the result of reflected sunlight whatsoever, but are functions of the massive timepiece above our heads, and it all functions for us. This is a test, a polarity experiment. The only thing that really matters in this life are your interactions with others. By doing so, you are putting parts of God back together. This is all God, all of it. Every last atom and substrate is a part of the fractured essence of The Divine. We are encouraged though ego to only see the separation, but the connection is where the sublime resides, and where we realise our true potential as part of that Grand Divinity. Magick occurs in the reattainment of our place in the cosmos as an aspect of God through recognition and reciprocation; not merely being, but being together. We truly make reality.</p>
