        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The gist of it is I was being harassed for approximately 7 hours, in an increasingly hostile and libelous manner. I contacted the mod team and asked them in an somewhat impolite fashion to enforce their rules. This request was refused and then members of the mod team began insulting and mocking me, including one who stated that a subsequent mod mail I sent was &quot;new copypasta&quot;, which in my eyes is an unacceptable implicit threat to make public a private communication which contains ample information that would make it relatively easy to identify me. Additionally after repeated requests to stop messaging me, including advice to refer to the Canadian and American definitions of criminal and aggravated criminal harassment. Then the harassment continued. Admins were contacted 5 times to report this harassment and criminal activity. After several hours I decided to take matters into my own hands. After offering a proposal which would lead to a swift resolution of the situation, a request to be made the sole mod of r/atheism temporarily, and an update of the OP to reflect the seriousness of the situation, I was contacted by an Admin, who informed me of their intentions to do &quot;nothing whatsoever&quot;.</p>

<p>I am a fan of atheist activity and I dislike religion. That being said, I am an autodidact and an independent amateur researcher who has been searching for the answers to a variety of questions for the last 35 years, give or take. The relevant question in this case is &quot;Does god exist?&quot;. I have had experiences considered by most people to be both objective and subjective, and the preliminary conclusion I have arrived at, after rigorous examination of the evidence and a great deal of effort applied to develop techniques to avoid the pitfalls of all cognitive biases that I am aware of, that the likelihood is roughly 75%, which is just a ballpark figure.</p>

<p>In an attempt to show solidarity with their cause, I posted what I intended to be a humorous post titled &quot;I believe in god and I have one thing to say to you people&quot;, IIRC.</p>

<p>The body of the post was simply &quot;F*** religion&quot;, in it&#39;s uncensored form. I am simply censoring it here as to not offend any religious believers any more than necessary. Also, you may not want to go to that thread. I say some mean things about some believers in there, as I was responding to a video that someone had posted, which was essentially a 13 minute lowlight reel of various religious belief systems, in the words of their believers. I was just having some fun while expression my general opinion, but it was more about what they were saying, not them personally. The world can be a confusing place, and their beliefs are a comfort to them.</p>

<p>I am not interested in comfort. I am interested in truth. </p>

None of my reports have resulted in the actions which are required by stated policy to deal with violation of these rules, either from their mods, or from Reddit admins. The procedures outlined here are insufficient and being ignored and thus my hand is forced to resort to legal action, in order to protect my reputation, emotional well-being, career, life&#39;s work, privacy and personal safety.

    <div class="md"><p>My work is valuable. I am willing to attest to this in a court of law, keeping in mind that there are aspects to my work that the public is not currently prepared to understand.</p>

<p>I am prepared to defend my reputation from damage in a court of law and here, in what I consider to be a sufficient proxy for the court of public opinion. They have threatened to damage my reputation before I have had an opportunity to establish it, therefore, the only way to get in front of the problem is to do so.</p>
