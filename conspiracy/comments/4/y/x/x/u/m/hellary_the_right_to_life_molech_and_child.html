<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;When or if does an unborn person have Constitutional Rights?&quot;</em></p>

<p>She replied, <em>&quot;That is not something that exists.  The unborn person does not have Constitutional Rights&quot;</em></p>

<p>The ethics of Personhood: Hillary referred to the baby as an &quot;unborn <em>person</em> while in the same breath states that the &quot;unborn <em>person</em> does not have Constitutional Rights.  Either the baby is a blob with zero rights, or the baby is a person with rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you wrote your comment like that. The person didn&#39;t claim to have spoken directly with her. She has said:</p>

<p>&quot;There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.&quot;</p>

<p>And no, before you ask, she didn&#39;t get on the phone and say it to me personally. </p>

<p>Is the person misconstruing her meaning? I don&#39;t know. It would seem to me if the pregnancy was in its latest stages and the mother was in danger, then they&#39;d try to deliver the baby rather than abort it? </p>

<p>In that respect, her saying she would support abortion in those circumstances is rather odd. Even suggesting abortion beyond the first semester is a bit weird to me. I&#39;m sure there are some rare circumstances that people could bring up where it makes sense, but as a general position, it seems a bit fucked.</p>

So why are you suggesting that am I ignorant? Because I think its appropriate to provide evidence along side ones public accusation? Or because you make the assumption that I am just someone too lazy to research shit myself? Or the assumption that I even plan to vote...</p>

<p>Here is the actual quote by the way...<br/>
Q:“When or if does an unborn child have constitutional rights?”    </p>

<p>A:&quot;Well, under our laws currently, that is not something that exists. The unborn person doesn’t have constitutional rights. Now, that doesn’t mean that we don’t do everything we possibly can in the vast majority of instances to, you know, help a mother who is carrying a child and wants to make sure that child will be healthy, to have appropriate medical support. It doesn’t mean that you don’t do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations. But it does not include sacrificing the woman’s right to make decisions.&quot;    </p>

<p>Now...tell me why the OP just didn&#39;t post that....( really not hard to understand why if you are paying attention) then tell me why you are hounding me for telling an OP to do the right fucking thing.</p>

<p>Asking for a source is not challenging someone....its asking for a source....and providing a source is suppose to happen if you expect to be taken seriously...    </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t google it...i clicked the link that someone other than the op provided....a link that has a different statement than what the op provided...( id also like to add that that reporter did a shit job.

<p>I haven&#39;t been pestering the OP....i have been replying to your retarded statements.....</p>

<p>Calling this topic common knowledge is another assumption on your part...    </p>

<p>as for your pathetic attempt to jab me with irony in the &quot;&quot;The DNC Rules Are Suspended, If Hillary Drops Out The Second Candidate With The Highest Number Of Delegates Gets The Nomination&quot;&quot; thread...no...i don&#39;t expect them to believe me without posting a source. But if you really want a source for my comment....just watch ANY FUCKING INTERVIEW OR WHATEVER OF HILARY FOR THE LAST 10 FUCKING YEARS.....saying that &quot;Hilary wants to be President badly&quot; and that &quot;she supports termination up to the minute of delivery&quot; are two very fucking different things. So why don&#39;t you pull your head out of your ass before you start trying to crack wise boyo.   </p>

<p>The correct answer, several posts back would have been:</p>

<p>&quot;yes, asking if he thought we believed him was a bit retarded. Obviously he did and it accomplished nothing, my bad, I was being a rhetorical cunt. </p>

<p>Also, asking for a source was a bit pointless, since I had no intention of actually discussing the issue once one was provided anyways.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A source for your comment would be appreciated. You don&#39;t expect people just to believe you when you say Hillary said something do you?&quot;    </p>

<p>That was my original comment.<br/>
Asking for a source was necessary because the OP did not and still has not provided one.</p>

<p>&quot;Hellree says that the Constitutional right to Life does not apply to babies in the womb - and supports termination up to the minute of delivery; if any proof is needed of her ethos of &quot;no right to exist&quot; - there it is.&quot;    </p>

<p>That is the OPs ACCUSATION. The burden of proof falls on the accuser.   </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah...pretty sure Hillary Will drop dead before she drops out of the race. That bitch wants it BAAAADDD. lol&quot;    </p>

<p>That is my OPINION about Hilary based on what I have seen and heard from her , and you asking for a &quot;source&quot; was retarded.    </p>

<p>&quot;since I had no intention of actually discussing the issue once one was provided anyways.&quot;    </p>

<p>Still haven&#39;t seen a source that mirrors the OPS accusation and no....its difficult to discuss the topic when some chode keeps telling me that Im ignorant and or some sort of asshole for thinking that an OP should provide source material when publicly and anonymously slinging accusations at people.    </p>

<p>You suck at this by the way....</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find I never insult people unless they have done so to me.</p>

<p>Even then, I usually don&#39;t. </p>

<p>As for calling you out on the source request, two points.</p>

<p>First, it wasn&#39;t necessary to ask it in such a rude manner.</p>

<p>2nd, source requests in this sub roughly are followed:</p>

<p>40% by a down vote for providing it.</p>

<p>50% by an attempt to debunk the sort using a variety of logical fallacies</p>

<p>8% by a valid debunking</p>

<p>2% by productive conversation.</p>

<p>As such, whenever the request appears too be for the 90% of non-valuable input that derails the thread, i will call the user out. Hence my username.</p>

<p>This sub is inundated with such derailments and I will do what I can to change that.</p>

<p>Please stop projecting and say something useful or cease and desist.</p>

<p>Have you even considered that I asked for a source because I have never heard or read her say what the OP quoted her saying? maybe i was a little rude in my first comment, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that its the accusers burden to provide evidence or that I was diligent in asking for source material.

<p>The &quot;knowledge&quot; was apparently not common enough because I hadn&#39;t, AND STILL HAVEN&#39;T seen any source material mirroring what the OP said.    </p>

<p>The OP is not &quot;venting&quot; he is accusing someone of saying something to sway the minds of people. In an election year....    </p>

<p>&quot;You were being a dick for no other reason than to be a dick&quot;    </p>

<p>There you go making wild assumptions about me again....I in fact, was curious about the topic, and that&#39;s why i asked for the source material. Could i have googled it? Absolutely...but if i did that for every fucking post without source material, i would spend the majority of my time doing what other people should be doing. And since the OP&#39;s comment was so inflammatory, I figured, a slight jab to his lack of etiquette was justified.    </p>

<p>Now...are you done? Or will your ego not allow you to stop while you are behind? </p>

<p>AND STILL HAVEN&#39;T seen any source material mirroring what the OP said.</p>

<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>at the very end...</p>

<p>of the third trimester...</p>

<p>are you going to require a source for when the:</p>

<p>very end</p>

<p>of</p>

<p>the third trimester </p>

<p>is?</p>

<p>Are you next going to be arguing over the meaning of &quot;is&quot;?</p>

<p>You can play all the nonsensical games that you like. You clearly have no interest in productive discussion. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s next</p>

<p>&quot;There can be&quot; then there&#39;s a &quot;but&quot;, in other words, the ability to abort isn&#39;t limited to the</p>

<p>very end</p>

<p>of </p>

<p>the third trimester </p>

<p>So, she does not limit it to any time in the pregnancy. I am interesting in hearing a legitimate reason why they would need to choose to abort a baby beyond the &quot;very end&quot; of the &quot;third trimester&quot;. </p>

<p>Perhaps there are very good reasons, but I haven&#39;t though of one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I in fact, was curious about the topic, and that&#39;s why i asked for the source material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asked, solicited, requested. i.e. you are putting the onus on others. I have provided you with a direct quote, and you are not satisfied. So not only putting the onus on others, but choosing to ignore it when delivered.</p>

<p>But are you putting the onus on others as a &quot;curious&quot; supplicant? </p>

<p>No. You were rude, and came across as derisive. Not how I usually think of a &quot;curious&quot; supplicant. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And since the <del>OP&#39;s</del> Hillary&#39;s comment was so inflammatory,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FTFY</p>

<p>At the very end</p>

<p>of the third semester</p>

<p>but not even limited to </p>

<p>the very end of the third trimester.</p>

<p>edit: Here is a baby born before the end of the third trimester:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lilaussieprems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image2223.jpg">http://www.lilaussieprems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image2223.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is what she is saying she agrees can be aborted, without restriction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude..I&#39;m sorry...but YOU ARE NOT A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION....you are an anonymous poster on an internet thread. Instead of so gracefully using your quotations button, why don&#39;t you just link the source of your quote?    </p>

<p>And for the record, in case it isn&#39;t clear to your clouded mind, I&#39;m not here to debate with you on whether abortion is a bad thing or not, or even if Hilary supports it. I&#39;m here debating you about providing source material when you publicly accuse someone of something BECAUSE you refuse to concede the point that its THE PROPER THING TO DO!   </p>

<p>And just in case you are SOME NUT attacking me because you think I approve of abortion, let me state for the record that I DO NOT. I think abortion is just a new speak word for murder, and that there are few things more despicable in society than the murder of a child. However, I&#39;m not going to just accept what some random anonymous posters say about someone, no matter how despicable of a person they are, WITHOUT SOME FUCKING EVIDENCE.   So chew on that for a while, become enlightened, and then write me and the readers of this debate an apology for being such a tunnel visioned, irrational, unobservant pleb of a commentator...I assure you your apology will be accepted when you offer it...  </p>

I disagree. I think it is those of you who irrationally engage in conversation and self justify attacking others because you lack either the mental capacity or humility to admit when you are wrong, that makes the &quot;world suck&quot;.  </p>

<p>Thats not asking for a source. And yes, when a candidate for president holds a position and someone brings it up online, I would assume that OP expected to be believed about it.</p>

<p>If you are unaware, then it is ignorance. Ignorant of you to challenge them. </p>

<p>Wow, now you managed to google it. Now tell me why you just didn&#39;t do that in the first place? </p>

<p>At some point, not knowing common knowledge is ignorance and pestering a user for a source on common knowledge is harassment. </p>

<p>Did you reach that point? I believe so. Just as you believe you haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>That you think you SHOULD HAVE demanded a link and quote to common knowledge is beyond me. </p>
