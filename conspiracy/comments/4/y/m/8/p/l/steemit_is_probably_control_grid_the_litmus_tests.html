        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Steemit is based on bitcoin, they claim.  That makes it censorship resistant, they say.  We honestly don&#39;t know their backend, we have to trust that they aren&#39;t casting an illusion on us by publishing technical details of steemit&#39;s working that don&#39;t actually match reality.  It would be trivial to spoof the alleged activity and mechanisms of bitcoin on steemit.  If you don&#39;t get to see the backend, you just have to believe them.  They use their own steemit currency also.</p>

<p>It does seem, however, to be legit if people are getting paid.  But there are ways to spoof that also...you could have an internal currency and &#39;curators&#39; who decide what something is worth (see the &#39;bernie sanders scam dollarvigilante&#39; post below).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, the US government has unlimited money (&#39;QE&#39;) to spend on a successful propaganda campaign to destroy reddit.  After all, knowledge is power and the total fucking distrust of the american people towards the government is priceless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondly, if Bitcoin itself is a scam, then steemit is a scam too.</p>

<p>Bitcoin involves cracking a code.  Who has the most / best equipment to crack codes?  The NSA.  They have a few trillion dollars invested in a whole building that is a computer.  Because of US Military Intelligence&#39;s (USMI&#39;s) NSA PRISM, bitcoin is an Elitist system you no longer have access to.  I&#39;ll expand.</p>

<p>You can no longer make money on it if you didn&#39;t get in on it from the get-go.  It&#39;s a ponzi scheme.  In order to mine for bitcoin, you have to have expensive equipment.  You can&#39;t buy enough equipment now to make enough bitcoin to pay for it and make a narrow margin, because of the way the system has worked.  In the beginning, mining was easy, but now it&#39;s all mined out and more computer power + time is needed to unlock harder puzzles.  That&#39;s just how it works.  </p>

<p>So to start now, you&#39;d need an astronomical investment in computer equipment and lots of spare, discounted energy, like for example a solar farm.  No one has that.  It&#39;s inherently more elitist as time goes on.  If you started now, with your computer, it would take over 20 yrs on average to get a bitcoin block, if you ever did get one--which you might not.  </p>

<p>My point is that bitcoin has always been elitists, never democratic.  It was never based on anything other than who has the most energy and technology.  People who got started early have the equipment, so does the USMI.  USMI also has unlimited power: they have excess coal reserves, some hydro, some solar and wind, and lots of natural gas and fracking petrol; they also have nukes, which means &#39;cheaper oil than everywhere else in the world....or else&#39;.</p>

<p>Therefore, the people who will have the most bitcoin at the end of the day is the US military <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/1-bitcoin-community-controls-99-bitcoin-wealth/">and the 1%</a>, period.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty clear the NSA are developing quantum computers. People have speculated that bitcoin at present does not use  quantum safe algorithms, and therefore at some point the US Mil can steal all the bitcoin that hasn&#39;t been transferred into a paper wallet.   That paper does no good either because the moment that bitcoin is put into a usable electronic wallet and a firewall opened, bam, it could be taken by an omnipresent AI agent that&#39;s running as several autonomous micro instances in your dishwasher, nest AC controller, your amazon dash button, your iphone, etc. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>First they fight you, then they win</strong></p>

<p>Only Governments engage in activities that involve inhibiting or threatening cryptocurrencies (and it&#39;s useful to mention they fight crypto tools generally...they fought pgp, they fought phpphone, they fought tor, they fought i2p, freenet, torrent, VPNs, they totally undermined SSL with heartbleed, etc). </p>

<p>Then the Silkroad busts. Other darknet sites. Hacks on bitcoin exchanges and banks.  Threats of TOR being undermined, heartbleed SSL bug making everyone question everything&#39;s security.  </p>

<p>Who ended up with that money?  <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/1-bitcoin-community-controls-99-bitcoin-wealth/">The 1%.</a>.  The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-we-owned-by-nsa-bitcoin-experts-discuss-how-to-evade-hardware-hacking">NSA?</a>  &lt;-- coin telegraph or cointel-egraph</p>

<p>You will notice the US Government fought bitcoin at first, trying to rope in the IRS, the SEC and trying to lawyer up on bitcoin, threatening everyone who was playing, and dissuading everyone from getting in on bitcoin.  (interesting, eh?)</p>

<p>Until the moment they seized the 20M or so in bitcoin from silkroad.  And that happened around the same time the exchanges were starting to be compromised and bitcoin stolen.  Then suddenly, the US changed its tune and bitcoin is no longer a threat.  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/us-government-sells-20-million-in-bitcoin-to-mystery-bidder-9578336.html">Why is that?  Think!</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s that now that bitcoin has value (ie: bitcoin now has the potential to be exchanged for goods and services because of the public&#39;s trust of the currency to have said value), and that <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2014/06/the-nsa-now-owns-bitcoin.html">if the US has the lion&#39;s share of bitcoin,</a> well they wouldn&#39;t to go fighting against a currency because that would only destroy its value.  They aren&#39;t going to destroy their own wealth, or act against it, in other words. </p>

<p><strong>Avarice and SCAM</strong></p>

<p>When I first went to Steemit, this article was prominent. Now you can&#39;t find it unless you search.  Everyone should read, esp. about how Sanders is abusing the system.</p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@dollarvigilante/steemit-is-a-scam-how-bernie-sanders-screwed-me">https://steemit.com/steemit/@dollarvigilante/steemit-is-a-scam-how-bernie-sanders-screwed-me</a></p>

<p>Yet, it&#39;s now back up to 2k+  Which is good.  </p>

<p>Also this user &#39;knows the CEO&#39; and made 12k in one month, isn&#39;t that something.  Too bad I don&#39;t know the CEO</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>But!  Corbett supports it</strong></p>

<p>I trust James Corbett, but I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s so quick to jump on steemit.  Seems premature, especially since they clearly suppress the conspiracy tag.</p>

<p>And knowing the relationship of bitcoin to power (it&#39;s a petrol-backed currency!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), and given he&#39;s made a documentary based on the history of petrol, he should know better than to back a dubious cryptocurrency based on oil. Period.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x5tsk/corbettreport_video_on_shilling_out_of_control/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x5tsk/corbettreport_video_on_shilling_out_of_control/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Trust but verify</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m ok with something new.  In fact I tried Steemit and I like it.  However, very few saw my post, nor will many.  Because it was tagged conspiracy as primary, and conspiracy will not show up in lists.  You have to get to conspiracy by gaming the url manually.  That&#39;s lame.  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>No Response from Support</strong>
I&#39;ve told steemit about this, but I&#39;ve not even gotten an email response to say, we&#39;ll respond when we can. It&#39;s literally gone into a black hole.  Steemit also did not respond to another unrelated support question I sent days before the &#39;glitch&#39; support email.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Fragmentation</strong></p>

<p>If you think I&#39;m &#39;throwing shade&#39; on steemit, I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m asking valid questions and pointing out things you might have missed.  Shill away if you must, but I&#39;m pretty much convinced that Steemit is just control grid, designed to fragment the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and other communities on reddit primarily (since it&#39;s  an alternative to reddit).  They tried this with voat and they are trying again by monetizing it.  You see that&#39;s the killer app.  Trying to tempt you with money.  Only problem is, it&#39;s based on bitcoin and it pays out ... what if bitcoin falls apart...as it was designed to do....all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You completely missed the idea of bitcoin, and your bad math shows this is just a shitpost. </p>

<p>bitcoin is a concept of a decentralized trust network.  It&#39;s a forum for free market capitalism.  It&#39;s open sourced and can be replicated in any form.  Also most of the seized coins have been sold at auction so that&#39;s another point your wrong on.  There aren&#39;t even 20m bitcoins mined yet (only about 15.7m).  I stopped reading there because you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>Or, you could be naive.  The fact that you&#39;ve resorted to profanity here, suggests that your ego is invested in Bitcoin, which means that you&#39;re unlikely to be receptive to contrary opinions, regardless of how factual they are.</p>

<p>Something being open source, by itself, does not automatically guarantee its&#39; immunity either.  Linux has been well and truly hijacked at this point, I assure you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the idea of gilding.  It makes you put your money whered your mouth is in terms of liking something.  Problerm is, those with money can abuse it as &quot;premium placement&quot;. This is how reddit gets it right by putting in a separate tab</p>

<p>Now only if karma beyond a community crowd managed threshold could generate gold that can only be given away....that would become essentially equivalent to a volunteerism based currency</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, yet again. I was excited about it until i found out about the signup requiring fb or a reddit account. Then below that they said sms verify coming soon. So, either have a fb account, link my reddit account, or link my phone number. All of that defeats the whole purpose of annon with bitcoin and the block chain. I also read the TOS and they collect quite a bit of info about you. From my reading, its basically a mix of non annon fb, reddit style up voting, and bitcoin. No thanks, especially in the world we live in today and the shit i (we) talk about here. Something doesn&#39;t sit well with me with that website... Just my two cents. </p>

<p>It gets easier to spot these things, once you realise that Millennials are incapable of genuinely good ideas.  Anything I see now that has been devised by anyone born after 1990, generally gets dismissed out of hand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is multiple account creation prevented?</p>

<p>One of the banes of rewarding users for posting is that people try to game the system by creating multiple accounts.</p>

<p>These accounts can be used to post/vote multiple times and thereby manipulate the popularity of posts.</p>

<p>Steemit tries to control this by requiring users to register through their Facebook accounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No good for me, left fibbook in 08, though I could see this as a means of additional data mining.</p>

<p>Imagine the data intel value if all your Reddit comments were tied to your fibbook profile?</p>

<p>Some more interesting info <a href="https://medium.com/@BlockByBlock/the-ugly-truth-behind-steemit-1a525f5e156#.fox8x74gj">here</a> I picked up via another reddit sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way to know whether or not Bitcoin is legit, is to ask if the powers that be would allow it, if it was really as subversive as is claimed.  It unfortunately is not only the Left who can be blinded by wishful thinking; Bitcoin is a good example of conservatives and AnClaps who insist on believing in Father Christmas, when sanity dictates otherwise.  I have considered Bitcoin (and truthfully cryptocurrencies more or less in general) a honeypot from day one, and have never gone near it.</p>

<p>If nothing else, Bitcoin has one major flaw; the blockchain, which is software&#39;s answer to the Nothing.  It just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and eventually no one is going to be able to copy it or store it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Remember</em></strong>:-  If the system wants something destroyed, then it <strong><em>gets</em></strong> destroyed.  It&#39;s exactly like what Mark Twain said about voting.  If Bitcoin was genuinely what it is claimed to be, it would not be permitted.</p>
