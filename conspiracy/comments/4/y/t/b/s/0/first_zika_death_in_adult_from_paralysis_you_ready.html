    <div class="md"><p>So they&#39;re going to use Zika, which  has tenuous links to negative effects on a small percentage of pregnant women and their unborn children?</p>

<p>Ebola would have been far more useful as a depopulation tool if it is as effective in countries with running water as its reported to be in countries without infrastructure.</p>

<p>There&#39;s too much of a heads up for me to buy it. Messiahs tend to step in for souls in unexpected crisis, not warn publicly ahead of time. That&#39;s usually PR and advertising at work.</p>

<p>NPR is running Zika  25% as much as Trump stories in my locality. Which is about as much as they were running Ebola.</p>

<p>Originally they said it just effected newborns. Then seemingly overnight &quot;a new study&quot; showed that it effected adult brains as well.</p>

<p>The website that holds the patent on the virus, has the characterised listed as paralysis and death.</p>

<p>Without some sources that can confirm the death toll is much higher than that reported, or that the rate of infection is much lower than reported, my concern will remain at Flu level. Skeptical, but open to change based on new information.</p>

<p>Please stop the personal attacks. You&#39;re the one spreading misinformation - intimidating, attacking, and accusing others of <em>being paid</em> (wtf) for noting this behavior or providing additional information/commenting on a thread we&#39;re all interested is fishy (and uncool) as fuck.</p>

<p>You know what also causes Guillain Barre? Certain vaccines. The flu. I.e., viruses. That Zika causes it as well is no surprise. I find it weird that you are pushing a specific narrative and accusing anyone who provides more information re:the vaccine testing and money train aspect of the Zika media onslaught totally fucked up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you put a link to the zika death article in your self.text, and also the relevant timestamp(s) for the video? Actually, I just got to the point. It starts at about 8:20. Just to clarify, it says &quot;2013 was practice, 2014 was the warm-up,&quot; but same general meaning I guess. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say I know your theory is wrong, but I will say it feels like a bit of a stretch. The 2013 practice/2014 warm-up slide is so vague as to seem applicable to almost anything in retrospect. It could be referring to Zika, but it could just as easily mean something else, or nothing in particular. </p>

<p>As far as Zika causing brain damage in adults, I think that conclusion might be a bit premature. The study was done in part by Rockefeller University, formerly Rockefeller Institute. Any time I see that name pop up, alarm bells go off. Check out James Corbett&#39;s excellent documentary on &quot;Rockefeller Medicine&quot; for more info on their connection with allopathic medicine. </p>

<p>I see this data point as fitting equally well with both the Zika-as-depopulation-agent and Zika-as-scare-tactic theories. If you need to try to make Zika a big scary threat, you need to make it seem scary for adults as well as pregnant women. </p>

<p>No Agenda has included Zika in a number of recent episodes, and their general theory seems to be that it&#39;s being used in part to get funds released that were initially meant for Ebola. Basically, a number of countries and NGOs pledge money to fight Ebola, but after the African epidemic was subdued, they didn&#39;t actually give that pledged money. They go over the numbers in their podcast, but their claim is that the amount of money Obama is asking for to fight Zika is the same amount of money pledged for Ebola that was never delivered. I don&#39;t know how to find the specific segments where they talked about it, but if you want, I can look them up for you. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I haven&#39;t made up my mind on this, though I do lean towards Zika as a scare tactic. That said, I think with any of these &quot;Big Operations,&quot; there&#39;s a number prongs to the plan, and a number of benefits for the actors. I think this is certainly being used to move money around between certain players, and I think the GMO mosquitoes were in the works for a while, and needed a Big Problem to convince the public to roll them out. This iteration might even be benign, but laying the groundwork for a future rollout that will have some intended adverse effect. </p>

<p>Good post. </p>

<p>This is simply not true. It&#39;s the first reported Zika paralysis death reported <em>in the US.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/09/guillain-barre-in-zika-patients/:">https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/09/guillain-barre-in-zika-patients/:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Colombia, three people with Zika-associated GBS have died, and health officials are investigating six other deaths. The country typically reports 240 or so cases of GBS each year, but had 86 in just five weeks in December and January, a few months after Zika was identified in Colombia, according to the WHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you. I did watch <em>most</em> of the video, and can see why you&#39;d want people to watch it. But for someone who wants to just jump in and discuss the potential Zika connection, it&#39;s easier for them to get right to the relevant parts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>I had a friend in real life skip to just the Zika related parts and I felt it didn&#39;t hit him as hard.</p>

<p>When you see all the parts, it becomes clear that someone has a sinister agenda. Then you wonder why someone with a sinister agenda is behind the making of a Bieber video.</p>

<p>Then it opens up a bunch of doors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link from Bloomberg that says &quot;zika may cause brain damage in adults too&quot; uses its information from a study on mice, not humans. They even say so in the study. </p>

So where is the link to adult brain damage? A video that makes a lot of claims with no evidence is not evidence, especially when all you can gather from the video is &quot;2013 was practice, 2014 was the warm up&quot; which could mean literally anything. You have 0 evidence they&#39;re talking about zika.</p>

<p>Just saying, actual evidence and sources are nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup he died from Guillain-Barré. 30 people out of 13,000+ Zika cases in Puerto Rico have Guillain-Barré. That&#39;s a 0.231% instance rate, which hardly represents a correlation. Now one out of 30 having died from Guillain-Barré is much higher, but it&#39;s still just one.</p>

<p>A lot more information is needed on Zika</p>

<p>Your second mistake was believing the bullshit written by the mainstream media.</p>

<p>The actual study was conducted on mice (which the article admits) but what the article doesn&#39;t point out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The degree to which IFN-deficient mice model the extent and severity of flavivirus infection in humans is unknown. We recognize that healthy humans may be able to mount an effective antiviral response and prevent entry into the CNS, but it remains a possibility that some immunocompromised humans and even some apparently healthy humans may be susceptible in ways modeled by the TKO mice. </p>

<p>In other words, they have no evidence that Zika virus affects human  brains the way it affects these mice.</p>

<p>NPR is running Zika  25% as much as Trump stories in my locality. Which is about as much as they were running Ebola.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your source on the mosquitoes being infected with Zika rather than the bacteria that makes the mosquitoes sterile and incapable of transmitting Zika?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m open to the possibility. But this song and dance feels an awful lot like yesteryears top 40.</p>
