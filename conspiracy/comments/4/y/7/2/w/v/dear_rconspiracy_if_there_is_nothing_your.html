    <div class="md"><p>THANK YOU</p>

<p>Fuck I hate this &quot;I don&#39;t wanna waste my vote&quot; bullshit. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve heard it now. I wish I could get all of those people that said it to me together just to say &quot;all you fuckfaces don&#39;t want to waste your vote. You all know the bipartisan system is BS. Obviously other people share your opinion. So stop falling for their fucking trap&quot;</p>

<p>I think the issue with that starts with the media. The media will only give you two choices to view, so people think there are only 2 to pick from. They let the media decide who&#39;s more qualified for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have issues with all 4 of the candidates running for president, more with some then the others. My choices are 2 candidates that I know are not going to win, and 2 that have a possibility of winning that I don&#39;t like. So should I vote for a candidate that I know is not going to win or vote for the lesser of two evils? The 3rd option is to not vote at all. The reason that 2 of the candidates don&#39;t have a chance of winning is because they do not have the supporters and infrastructure to win and not the press says. I know it&#39;s hard to believe but the press tends to report on what the people want to hear because if they report on things nobody wants to hear then people will stop watching the station. Even though the majority of tv, radio, and newspapers are controlled by a small # of companies you still have more options for news then ever in history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually LOL&#39;ed. You&#39;re telling me that the MAINSTREAM media, as a whole, covers the election fairly? That they are just covering two shitty candidates because that&#39;s what the people want?</p>

<p>It is incredibly disappointing whenever I hear people say, &quot;Gary Johnson? Who&#39;s that?&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ve never even heard of Jill Stein&quot;. It isn&#39;t because they don&#39;t have the &quot;supporters or infrastructure&quot;, it&#39;s because they are trying to compete in a game that has been rigged against them. </p>

<p>True democracy can only be achieved through honest and fair coverage of the election from the press. Now I am genuinely asking you, do you think that the MSM coverage of this election is fair and honest?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How was I mocking the idea of a 3rd party? All I said was the chance of one of them wining is a long shot. I sometimes gamble and pick the long shot in case they win. I would make much more money if I win with a long shot then if I pick the favorite. The biggest issue I have with a 3rd party is how much more disfunctional our government would be. Think of how things would be if the president was of one party and each house of Congress was a different one.</p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>If you want to get technical, all presidents but one have been on this same bloodline. This was figured out by a 12 year old who mapped their genealogy.</p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>If you want to get technical, all presidents but one have been on this same bloodline. This was figured out by a 12 year old who mapped their genealogy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, The media is out of control in an insane feeding frenzy like junior detectives trying to please dad. They&#39;ve taken to falling over all over each other to gain recognition for the most unseemly bashing stories of Trump who I&#39;m not emphatically &quot;for&quot;. The enemy is the milquetoast complicity of the whole media (6 Companies), good little brownshirt assholes, perhaps &quot;brown-stripes&quot; because they&#39;ve shit themselves. Read Matt Taibbi&#39;s &quot;Rollingstone&quot; article on same. </p>

<p>Since it is such complicity, itself a purposeful <em>conspiracy</em> defined literally as BREATHING TOGETHER done at the beck and call of the Hitlery campaign and the neocon masters it, indeed, belongs here in this forum. </p>

<p>I support Trump because we need him to break the backs of the current oligopoly who have been ripping off the middle class to their demise and the total collapse, what was good about America.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to watch these sycophants the day AFTER a Trump victory. Frankly I don&#39;t give a shit if he&#39;s worse than Obama if that&#39;s possible. I&#39;d love to see Trump crack some heads, install some Supreme Court judges that just MIGHT fuck up the oligarchs&#39; long grift. If it resulted in the end of the neocon and the arrest of bankers and the gutting of the Fed, I&#39;d count it as ultimate victory. Also send the war mongers packing and, indeed, it would make America Great Again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mixed I guess, if they&#39;re financially benefitting from their fellow (ex) citizens it&#39;s fair game. If they&#39;re no longer connected to the system and only providing services to their new country expecting them to renounce citizenship to escape the tax seems a bit like saying &#39;you are property&#39;. God knows where you&#39;d draw the line though. Perhaps paying back enough tax to cover the cost of your education and accumulated benefits would be adequate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I believe that if you still think you can vote your self free, you haven&#39;t been paying attention.</p>

<p>Two things that I&#39;ve learned in all my years:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nothing in politics happens by accident or chance.  There&#39;s way too much money and lives at stake (I&#39;m not talking about yours or mine).</p></li>
<li><p>If voting really changed anything, they&#39;d make it illegal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Until this system collapses, those facts will remain.  Call me cynical.</p>

<p>Stop the current strategy of nation-building and regime change.</p>

<p>Stop unvetted Soros pushed immigration</p>

<p>Put America first (instead of that other country)</p>

<p>Stop the horrible globalization trade agenda</p>

<p>Protect the 2cd amendment</p>

<p><strong>and I fully push that agenda</strong></p>

<p>Maybe this sub has forgotten what it stands for. Don&#39;t you see all these posts trying to turn you against the one candidate talking about the stuff that we talked about before the elections started?</p>
