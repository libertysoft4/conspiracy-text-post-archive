<p><strong>9/11/2002 ABC News Special with Peter Jennings</strong></p>

<p>In an appearance on the 9/11/2002 ABC News special <em>9/11</em><sup><a href="http://worldtradeaftermath.com/wta/news/tv_schedule_9-11-2002.asp">1</a>,</sup> DiFrancesco recalled his last memory of escaping the collapsing South Tower.</p>

<p>Narrator: &quot;<em>As the South Tower began to fall, Ron DiFrancesco was just reaching the exit. He is one of the last people to make it out alive.</em>&quot; </p>

<p>Ron DiFrancesco: &quot;<em>I looked out to Liberty Street and saw a big fireball coming. That&#39;s all I remember.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Narrator: &quot;<em>Ron DiFrancesco was blown across the street. He regained consciousness days later in a hospital. He had a fractured skull and burns over sixty seven percent of his body.</em>&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>9/11: A Tale of Two Towers</strong></p>

<p>In the 2002 British documentary 9/11: The Tale of Two Towers by Michael Atwell<sup><a href="http://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/bpt/C62B0C78DDD0725E85256D5F00611E99?OpenDocument">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=1535bf74-6fc3-466b-9f5e-f075ca5fd588">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/d14ac4ffee990491852566410073d4d1/c62b0c78ddd0725e85256d5f00611e99/$file/towers.pdf">4</a></sup> , DiFrancesco retold his story. </p>

<p>Narrator: &quot;<em>After his escape from the South Tower, as Ron DiFrancesco ran away, he was hit by a fireball, apparently caused by the building collapsing. He was probably the last person out alive.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Ron DiFrancesco: &quot;<em>I saw the fireball and heard a loud noise and that&#39;s all I remember, and I woke up six days later at Saint Vincent&#39;s... I got hit on the head and I had a big gash in my head here and I was in the ICU for six days, five or six days, and I wasn&#39;t really conscious and I had third degree burns on both my arms.</em>&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Last One Out Alive by Andrew Duffy</strong></p>

<p>Journalist Andrew Duffy interviewed DiFrancesco and published an article in National Post on June 4, 2005 entitled <em>Last One Out Alive: A 9/11 Survivor&#39;s Tale</em> <sup><a href="http://www.peaceandlove.ca/survivor.html">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=L2BXqkWAgdwC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=%22andrew+duffy%22+%22last+one+out+alive%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XXXkEsB6DM&amp;sig=EJdWMQ8h8ksSdssFqim3fMBf00Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig2YisxprKAhVL2SYKHS0vBH0Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22andrew%20duffy%22%20%22last%20one%20out%20alive%22&amp;f=false">6</a></sup> .</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Walking south, they tried to leave the tower at Liberty Street, but another guard redirected them to the northeast exit that led to Church Street. They made their way back through the concourse. It never occurred to either of them that they were still in danger. But the South Tower&#39;s steel supports were failing; the building was in its final moments as a skyscraper. As Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Kren passed an adjoining hallway near the Church Street exit, they heard an ungodly roar. Mr. DiFrancesco turned to his right in the direction of Liberty Street, to see a massive fireball -- compressed as the South Tower fell -- roiling toward them. &quot;Run!&quot; he yelled. The two men bolted for the exit. Mr. DiFrancesco was bowled over by the explosion as he reached some stairs. Something slammed into the back of his head. The last thing he remembers is the sound of his own voice: &quot;Help me, help me!&quot;</em>&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Beyond 9/11: Portraits of Resilience</strong></p>

<p>Eight years later, DiFrancesco appeared on the 2011 HBO documentary <em>Beyond 9/11: Portraits of Resilience</em>.</p>

<p>Brian Clark: &quot;<em>Ron DiFrancesco who went in the 81st floor with me, he went up to 91, caught up to the people laying down on the floor thinking that there was fresher air at floor level. He made his way back through the stairs and I guess he went through the slot that Stanley and I had sort of created down Stairway A.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Ron DiFrancesco: &quot;<em>And so I started to run downstairs and so I ended up on ground level and I went to walk out. And I wanted to walk out into the courtyard, but there was a lot of debris and people jumping and it looked like a war zone. So they made us go through the concourse area.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Brian Clark: &quot;<em>When he was exiting the building, he heard an explosion, he spun around and a fireball was coming down the hallway at him. He put his arms up, blew him across Church Street. He woke up in the hospital two days later.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Ron DiFrancesco: &quot;<em>I had burns they say on 80 percent of my body and I had broken a bone in my back and, you know, I had my contacts in so they were melted to my eyes and my wife said she came into the hospital two days later and walked right past me. I guess my ears were turned inside out just with the burns my head was very swollen. And so I was in the hospital for 12 days and then I went home back to New Jersey to recover.</em>&quot; </p>

<p><strong>The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible</strong></p>

<p>Writer John Geiger, who interviewed DiFranceco on August 23, 2005 interview<sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=L2BXqkWAgdwC&amp;q=john+geiger#v=snippet&amp;q=john%20geiger&amp;f=false">7</a></sup> , wrote in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Third-Man-Factor-Impossible/dp/1602861293"><em>The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible</em></a>: &quot;<em>DiFrancesco continued down as fast as he could, finally reaching the plaza level. He headed for an exit, but was stopped by a security guard who told him it was too dangerous. He looked out in horror at the falling debris and victims. He was directed to another exit. He walked back through the concourse towards the northeast exit, near Church Street. He was still in extreme danger. Fifty-six minutes had passed since the plane hit. The impact had severed many of the South Tower&#39;s vertical support columns. The heat from the explosion and fire had weakened the steel trusses. The floors of the crippled building began to &quot;pancake down&quot; in a floor-by-floor collapse. As he approached the Church Street exit, DiFrancesco heard an &quot;ungodly roar&quot;. He saw a fireball as the building compressed. He doesn&#39;t know what happened next, and was unconscious for some time after his narrow escape, waking up much later at St. Vincent&#39;s hospital in Manhattan.</em>&quot;<sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=L2BXqkWAgdwC&amp;q=difrancesco#v=snippet&amp;q=difrancesco&amp;f=false">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112746464">9</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Explorer: The Angel Effect</strong></p>

<p>Ron DiFrancesco once again told his story on the National Geographic documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895018/"><em>Explorer: The Angel Effect</em></a>, based on John Geiger&#39;s book. </p>

<p>Narrator: &quot;Fifty-six minutes have now passed since the plane hit the South Tower. Ron and his colleagues make it out of the building.&quot;</p>

<p>Ron DiFrancesco: &quot;We heard this loud roar, and looked down to the right and saw this huge fireball coming at us and I just yelled at them to run. And I was trying to get out, and i was- the fireball hit me and knocked me down and I woke up three days later in Saint Vincent&#39;s.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even internationalskeptics.com has discussed this guy. This guy is walking around mainstream sources everywhere talking about explosions and hardly anybody notices! With the physical evidence of his injuries, which are inconsistent with just being hit by falling debris, this powerful fireball explosion had to have happened. The only thing that&#39;s left for debunkers is to explain how the collapsing structure could somehow push the office fires down the core structure hundreds of feet and explode outwards in a focused manner with such extreme force. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly hadn&#39;t heard his story until you shared it.</p>

<p>&quot;With the physical evidence of his injuries, which are inconsistent with just being hit by falling debris,&quot;</p>

<p>It sounds like what happened to Bob Mcllvaine&#39;s son.
 But the kicker with his is, he was killed way BEFORE the towers fell and as he was entering the lobby.</p>

<p>He is the only 9/11 victim to had had an autopsy. And those results do not lie.</p>

<p>I&#39;m mobile right now but I will return and ETA a link with Bob talking about his sons autopsy results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen Bob Mcllvaine speak, but his son&#39;s injuries could be attributed to the jet-fuel-in-the-elevator-shafts theory (of which there is no evidence for besides witnesses smelling fuel).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the interview where he talks about his injuries....</p>

<p>He thinks he was killed by an explosion in the lobby before the first plane hit. His burns were very minor and not the cause of death. </p>

<p>Jet fuel did indeed burn and kill Jennieann Maffeo and permanently damage Lauren Manning as they walked into the lobby.</p>

<p>I think Ron&#39;s story is interesting and VITAL because by that time there was absolutely NO jet fuel left and certainly not enough to cause a fireball in the lobby to blast this guy across the street.</p>

<p>So what did?</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you posted this because I had no idea about him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bob only thinks it was before the plane hit from talking to William Rodriquez. There are witnesses who remembered the ground level explosions after the plane and there&#39;s no reason not to just think the before-the-plane witnesses could just be confused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh good point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is any confusion as to what happened to Ron. </p>

<p>Your post shows that his story is in many places but no one is  questioning it like they have been with Bob&#39;s son.</p>

<p>The great thing with Ron, he was there, he lived it.
 His story is consistent and has never wavered. </p>

<p>Do you think it was a final explosion/explosives in the lobby that caused Ron&#39;s injuries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is known for a fact that there were explosions coming out of many elevators, mostly the lobby and basement floors. While it is concievable that some jet fuel could&#39;ve gotten all the way down there, the problem is the sheer force of the explosions. A guy running out of the North Tower after the first plane crash saw a 300 pound steel-concrete fire door that blew off it&#39;s hinges and was &quot;crinkled like aluminum foil&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>Jet Fuel can account for a few explosions but not all. Much of it was burned off on impact. Also quite a bit of it rained down the facade of the building. </p>

<p>And it certainly can&#39;t explain the fire door (not an elevator shaft) you talk about. Also by the time Ron was escaping there is no way there was any fuel left.</p>
