        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the record, I have nominated myself in the mod beauty contest, but I have some suggestions regarding the selection criteria for all candidates. I like the <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a> requirement that candidates should have a year-old account and 1000 karma, because it allows other users to see what they&#39;re voting for, but I think we should go further.</p>

<p>Firstly, there are a number of recently appointed mods who are not at all active on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which makes no sense for such an active subreddit. I have no personal beef against <a href="/u/creq">/u/creq</a> or <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a>, but both these users clearly have little interest in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and prefer spending their time on other subreddits. With so many potential candidates who would be willing to be &quot;active&quot; mods, I think it important that <strong>only candidates who are willing to put the time in should be eligible for selection from now on.</strong></p>

<p>Secondly, the issue of conflicts of interest. Last year, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lost a mod because they had a commercial interest in a well known 9/11 conspiracy site which affected the PERCEPTION of their impartiality. </p>

<p>This being <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, where the impartiality, and the perceived impartiality, of the mod team is so important,  I would like to make a proposal that any new mods should disclose any religious, political, group or commercial interests that might conflict with their perceived impartiality. This doesn&#39;t mean they should be barred from becoming mods, just that they should perhaps be recused from making mod decisions (eg bans or deletions) on subjects they may be conflicted on. For that, we would need to know what those potential conflicts are before they are selected.</p>

<p>What I think mod candidates should declare (up for discussion, obviously):</p>

<ul>
<li>I identify as a [Christian/Jew/Muslim/Mormon/Other religious denomination/atheist/agnostic].</li>
<li>I [have/do not have] a commercial interest in a rival business/website relating to conspiracies.</li>
<li>I [am/am not] a member of a Masonic group or similar society.</li>
<li>I [am/am not] an activist in a political party or pressure group.</li>
<li>I [am/am not] employed directly or indirectly by the government of my country.</li>
<li>I [have/do not have] any other affiliations or restrictions that might be perceived as conflicting with my impartiality as a moderator of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</li>
<li>I undertake to be an ACTIVE moderator, contributing to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for one hour per day (or 30 hours per month) on average.</li>
<li>I undertake to carry out my mod duties in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with impartiality, and consistency, and to protect the ethos and the legitimate users of this subreddit from external disruptors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other suggestions - have I covered all the bases?</p>

<p>You have been making many &quot;unworthy&quot; reports? Do you think that 20 unworthy reports is worth a ban? I don&#39;t expect the mods are counting, but since you are, and so concerned with actions, perhaps when you get to twenty you will take those actions which are &quot;worthy&quot;.</p>

<p>I personally believe that rockran is an honest user who is mostly at odds with this community.  I have looked into their history more than I have most users because of the reports we receive when they find themselves at odds, and I have never seen a violation of the rules that would justify him/her being banned.</p>

<p>Trolls always lose their shit given enough time and get themselves banned.  Sometimes people just aren&#39;t going to agree with us and as long as they are respectful of our rules and our community then they are welcome here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one year thing is too long. The sub is pretty dynamic and a lot of the frequent posters here are new, as it is expected and hoped. </p>

<p>We do want more users? Those will be new? Perhaps there will be some good ones?</p>

<p>It should be about activity. u/Putin_Loves_Cats is a good example.</p>

<p>Impartiality is not even possible. We are discussing topics that if a user has not heard of, been affected by, and had no opinion on, then they probably aren&#39;t the right person to make a determination.</p>

<p>If after 14 1/2 years, someone is impartial to 9/11, we need to take that into consideration. This is r/conspiracy, to be impartial to 9/11 suggests a strong correlation with swallowing probable deniability. Being partial to probable deniability is a problem. </p>

<p>What we have got going for us is lack of censorship. My main concern is we continue not to censor.</p>

<p>My second concern is that we start labelling. For example, there are subs that act as info depots. If that info has been rated legit, we should be able to tag the comments as such. If rated as debunked, then the post should be tagged as such if it can&#39;t be proven to be invalidly debunked.</p>

<p>Acting as if disinfo doesn&#39;t exist allows it to deteriorate the credibility of valid info. It causes endless discussions about topics that have been argued for years. It divides and doesn&#39;t allow for cohesive understanding.</p>

<p>Tagging these posts just allows for the conversation to be furthered and not derailed. The comment stays up, but stays up as valid or debunked.</p>

<p>u/lucycohen has been an active contributor who has amassed a great deal of valid info and yet with each post she makes, we are allowing hosts of paid,  professional propagandists to consume her time and destroy her efforts. </p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t our community recognize, support and endorse the valid studies that she has brought to our attention and take those actions necessary to enable her to withstand the attacks of online mercenaries?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see her selling anything but her time and energy. I would like to show some gratitude.</p>

<p>How we go about qualifying something as debunked is a matter for discussion. Whether we should is a matter for discussion. </p>

<p>But whether we should ourselves in circles and allow the sub to be subjected to the very people we are trying to bring to light and offer ourselves no protections, no means of cohesion, no means of validation, and no means of developing conclusions, then it is not a place for information sharing, but a place for distraction.</p>

<p>If u/GeorgeRoberts2015 (sorry about getting your name wrong) information dumps are valid, then the valid info should not need to face the flings and arrows of every sucker who is worried about their mortgage and so need to sell their soul online to make ends meet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  I had already planned on inviting our new mods to disclose any potential conflicts of interest upon their accepting the mod invite.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily think any such disclosure should be public knowledge, but at least the mod team should know about it to help check each other&#39;s bias.</p>

<p>Beyond this my personal stance is that even though i don&#39;t agree with certain theories, I will not move to exclude them from the scope of acceptable opinion here at /conspiracy.  </p>

<p>The focus of a conspiracy mod should be on the behavior of our users here and not at all on the subject of the discussion.  Where we impose limits on how you may act here in an effort to increase the quality of discussions, without bias over the subject matter being a factor in any actions taken by mods.</p>

<p>Some people feel like our rules on behavior are a restriction of free speech, and I agree that they are just that.  But I believe that they are reasonable restrictions which lubricate the gears of open and honest discussion.</p>

<p>One must consider the environment of anonymous Internet trolls, oppressive opposition groups, and &#39;censorship by noise&#39; tactics used by governments around the world when critically analyzing our rules.</p>

<p>Do I want to censor people from talking about racially charged subjects?  No I don&#39;t.  But can those subjects be reasonably discussed if 20 provocateurs are spamming the comments with slurs and racially offensive jokes?  No they can&#39;t.  So we compromise and allow the discussion of racially sensitive subjects without the inclusion of racial slurs.</p>

<p>Free speech doesn&#39;t need to be a contest of who can be the most offensive, nor does a forum like this one need to be scrubbed of offensive content.</p>

<p>I hope the new mods will evaluate these philosophical conflicts with care and keep the balance we have achieved intact.  That being said, new players can change the game for the better or for the worse.  Only time will tell what green pastures we are about to sow, or what demons we are about to let loose.</p>

<p>I think the community has chosen wisely, I hope we aren&#39;t disappointed.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Surely the rules are fairly clear about behaviour, the fact that there is a mod <em>team</em> means that bias should hardly ever be a factor.</p>
