    <div class="md"><p>The fuckwit admitted obtaining drugs to &quot;seduce&quot; women.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interest in Mr. Cosby’s deposition grew this month when a federal judge unsealed a 62-page memorandum of law in the case, which had been settled in 2006. The memorandum contained excerpts from the deposition, including Mr. Cosby’s acknowledgment that he had obtained quaaludes as part of his effort to have sex with women.</p>

<p>The asshole had been getting away with it for so long that he thought even this admission wouldn&#39;t hurt him, and it didn&#39;t. He bought off the victim and made her keep silent.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how rich assholes like this get away with the kinds of crimes that would result in any normal person sitting in prison for a few years, at least.</p>

<p>I never said any such thing.</p>

<p>I said we have no evidence that they weren&#39;t false reports. Women have been known to file false rape reports as a weapon against men they do not like.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not really. I asked if the few sexual assaults that were reported were an increase from previous years, and said that false reports could explain the apparent increase, and that racism might have motivated some of the reports.</p>

<p>The lies surrounding those reports were definitely being promoted by lying racists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree; he got away with it, for a while anyway. i&#39;m sure there were many people that helped to keep it all quiet. his personal assistant kept a log of how much money he paid to different women. </p>

<p>this shit has been ongoing in the media complex forever. for whatever reason &amp; i&#39;m sure there is one, Cosby is the &quot;fall guy&quot;. i&#39;m still waiting for the truth to drop about the pervs abusing children.</p>

<p>&quot;Frank Scotti, a 90-year-old ex-NBC employee, is the latest to go public with stories of Bill Cosby’s past.</p>

<p>Scotti, who worked as a facilities manager for the Brooklyn NBC Studio where “Cosby Show” was filmed, told the New York Daily News that he arranged for monthly payments and more for eight women during “The Cosby Show’s” run from 1984-1992. He claimed some women would receive as much as $2,000 at a time.</p>

<p>“He had everybody fooled,” Scotti said to the Daily News. “Nobody suspected.”</p>

<p>Scotti provided copies of money orders to four women to the Daily News and said Cosby asked him to put his own name on them.</p>

<p>“He was covering himself by having my name on it,” he said. “It was a coverup. I realized it later.”</p>

<p>Almost every major pop star or celebrity icon has lost someone precious to them. Some people in youtube videos and other places have cited this as a blood sacrifice. This is required to move up in the world and a bond of love is more tangible and valuable than anything to the prince of darkness.</p>

<p>The couple, who own hundreds of acres of protected land in Shelburne Falls, about 100 miles west of Boston, have been opposed to the pipeline since the company notified them last winter of plans to survey their land.</p>

<p>She claims she had a public responsibility when she said that she knew that her father was raping her sister for years,and yet she didn&#39;t even bother to go to the cops about it or not even her own mother.</p>

<p>&quot;You didn&#39;t speak out when you were 12?&quot;- Dr.</p>

<p><em>Daughter shakes head no.</em>(you let your younger sister get raped)</p>

<p>&quot;You didn&#39;t tell your mother?-Dr.</p>

<p><em>Daughter shakes head no.</em>(you let your younger sister get raped)</p>

<p>&quot;You didn&#39;t tell his wives?&quot;</p>

<p><em>Daughter shakes head no.</em>(you let your younger sister get raped)</p>

<p>&quot;You didn&#39;t tell the police?&quot;-dr</p>

<p><em>Daughter shakes head no.</em>(you let your younger sister get raped)</p>

<p>&quot;So why are you telling this story? Why here, why now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know for one my sister needs me. She needs someone who can speak for her, that&#39;s the main reason.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Daughters voice changes</em>(Like the Sandy hook father)</p>

<p><em>Also I have a responsibility, I am in the public eye. there all these little girls who need me</em>

<p><a href="http://downtrend.com/71superb/sons-guns-star-will-hayden-arrested-child-molestation">http://downtrend.com/71superb/sons-guns-star-will-hayden-arrested-child-molestation</a></p>

<p>The star of reality TV show Sons of Guns has been arrested for child molestation - but he insists the claims are the work of a bitter ex-girlfriend.
William Hayden, 49, whose show airs on the Discovery Channel, was arrested in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Saturday on charges of molestation of a child and a crime against nature.</p>

<p>The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released, according to the sheriff&#39;s website.
While the case has been sealed by a judge, Hayden told TMZ that his ex-girlfriend, who is mother to one of his daughters, went to authorities a week ago and accused him of molesting the girl.</p>

<p>He said that she did it as revenge for him ending their relationship.
Hayden has since married and is bringing up the girl with his new wife. The youngster returned to his home after he was interviewed by Child Protective Services.</p>

<p>His older daughter Stephanie, who appears on Sons of Guns beside him, said that her father was innocent.
&#39;There was never any impropriety in our home,&#39; she said. &#39;He was and is a good father.&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Monday, she took to Facebook to defend her father.</p>

<p>&#39;This was a false allegation and unfortunately that&#39;s all it takes,&#39; she wrote. &#39;My father is a good man, and ALL of his children love him very much and are truly sickened that a person would try to do this to our family. Its not right [sic]. You see the love we have for our family…
&#39;The one thing that really hurts us is that my sister is heartbroken that anyone could think this of her father. Its a nightmare…please stand with us.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems odd that CPS would interview the daughter, return her to Hayden’s home, and then arrest him anyway. If they thought there was a hint of truth to the allegation, they would have never brought the daughter back to the home.</p>

<p>Stephanie Hayden, Will’s other daughter and fellow Sons star, is adamant that her father is innocent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, chill.  I&#39;m an atheist born Christian by the way, but I can limit it to calling you a bigot if that makes you more comfortable.  The fact is that the vast bulk of your  statements have revolved around disparaging a group based on their religion.  If this discussion had begun with you saying &quot;If he&#39;d been a Catholic priest he would get away with it&quot; and then claimed I was shilling for Jesuits and continually made insulting comments about Catholics, same thing.  I wouldn&#39;t have said you were anti-Jesusite as I find that a stupid word, but I would have used something like anti-Christian.  I also don&#39;t care about antisemitism more than say bigotry against Catholics but this does not change the fact that all of your statements have revolved around disparaging an entire group based on... um... nothing.  That&#39;s bigotry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.Many posts with videos linked are down voted before there is time to have actually watched the evidence being presented to make a decision whether to agree or not. I know I cannot change the world with a post. But as someone who likes to try it is fucked up when someone disagrees without offering an explanation as to why. Which is rampant in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it can be frustrating. At the end of the day, though, I think many people will see what they want to and believe what they want to regardless of what&#39;s presented to them. I think such beliefs become tied so up in their egos and identities that anything to the contrary is seen as a personal attack. As humans are fundamentally emotional creatures, that generally hurts to a degree. The difficulty is separating one&#39;s identity from one&#39;s beliefs so that one can have a truly open mind.  </p>

<p>That goes for everyone. For both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel ya. I am of saltine background myself. I grew up different than most. Strangely I have been treated worse by &quot;my own people&quot; than my boys who I grew up with. Their families taught me in the 80&#39;s that there were two systems for people in America. It is real sad cause I did not get it until I was moved to all white town in GA and no more of my friends all white people. An I learned I was a nigger according to them. It hit me hard and made me miss home. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out  u/Rotundus_Maximus&#39; post up the thread. He makes valid points. Cosby is being smeared for what he was trying to do. All this racism is dead bullshit is just that. They give enough to keep the libs happy then take away power when it becomes too much. Notice how Oprah has never strayed from her lane. She is rich,she has a network, but she also keeps her mouth shut. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its a deliberate take down on Cosby, he said the wrong thing, time to destroy his life and reputation.</p>

<p>hollywood (jews of course) generally hates black people and black culture. they are not too keen on whites excpet as a cash cow to milk, blacks have been run down by hollywood since its inception, even TV today does the denigration of blacks.</p>

<p>Psych being a good example of how hollywood/burbank portrays black characters, the black sidekick is an intelligent  chemist tech, yet they showed him doing the wide eyed high running gait thing, classic 30s put down.</p>

<p>His contract only guaranteed him 10% of what his show made. He wanted more to do more shows.</p>

<p>Instead, the next day there were stories all over the media about how he went to Africa to smoke crack.</p>

<p>That one pisses me off the most because its so completely stupid and racist but the american public still bought it</p>

Such as a lot of these women had long sexual relationships with him, and several have been proven to be lying an others never say rape but forcible kissing. If that itself can be used as a claim of rape there are a lot of men in this country who are now rapists. </p>
