<blockquote>
<p>In 2015, we will see the emergence of more automated computational propaganda -- bots using sophisticated artificial intelligence frameworks, removing the need to have humans operate the profiles. Algorithms will not only read the news, but write it. These stories will be nearly indistinguishable from those written by humans. They will be algorithmically tailored to each individual and employed to change their political beliefs or to manipulate their actions.</p>

<p>In 2015 we will also see the first results from initial field tests of the US IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) project to deploy propaganda bots in South America in an attempt to influence local political opinion.</p>

<p>It is still early days -- many of the bots deployed in 2015 will be programmed to use relatively simple heuristic techniques to imitate intelligence. But, powered by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, propaganda bots will soon run on genetic algorithms that let their ideas and messaging evolve, based on the resonance and effectiveness of previous messages. We are likely to see versions of these bots deployed on US audiences as part of the 2016 presidential election campaigns...</p>

<p>It&#39;s worse than this. A lot of people know what a shill is and that it&#39;s happening. But try and tell them that it&#39;s going on in a particular sub and they refuse to accept it.</p>

<p>I tried telling a guy on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> how shills were taking over the comments section on certain stories. I pointed out the upvote/downvote patterns on certain comments. I pointed out how certain users had comment histories devoted to a single topic. Nope, they just didn&#39;t want to believe that it was happening. </p>

<p>Maybe the reason for this is that it&#39;s a painful realization. On the one hand, you could admit that rampant shilling was going on all around you. But this would also mean having to admit that you were blind to it and someone else had to point it out in order for you to realize what was going on.</p>

<p>For many people, their pride simply won&#39;t allow them to make such a change to the way they see things. They&#39;d rather stay blind if it means their pride stays intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might have better luck spreading the information from <a href="/r/shills">/r/shills</a>, then pointing out how Reddit is the perfect platform for marketing. Let them add the 2+2 instead of telling them the answer is 4. </p>

<p>A lot of people tend to think the front page is only seen by maybe 10,000 people because of the upvotes. Imgur has an actual view count, so if you go to <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a>, the upvotes on the top post will be 5,000, but the views are actually 200,000. So you can see why marketers are interested in the front page of Reddit. Young people don&#39;t watch TV. Our commercials are on the front page. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That thought did occur to me. It seemed hard to believe that anyone could be so dense.</p>

<p>Then again, you often run into people who simply refuse to back down and admit they might be wrong and someone else is right.</p>

<p>To me, a comment history comprised of 98%+ comments in support of one particular country is enough to diagnose a shill. They might be paid or they might be doing it for free. Either way, that&#39;s a shill if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if it&#39;s their country that&#39;s fairly understandable. People tend to favour their own country more strongly and get defensive about it.</p>

<p>So with someone like Putinlovescats (picked at random), the possibilities are theoretically that they&#39;re Russian and a bit defensive, or that they&#39;re a Russian Nationalist making sure that those Americans don&#39;t badmouth his country given there&#39;s so many of them on the web, or he&#39;s a Russian shill (since it&#39;s well known Russia has plenty of them too), or he&#39;s not even Russian - perhaps Eastern European and is just a bit xenophobic when it comes to Westerners... or some other possibility? I&#39;m sure other people could come up with other ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to name any names. Just saying that a rational, open minded person should be able to see more than one side of any issue. By the same measure, a legitimate reddit user ought to have a varied post history.</p>

<p>So when I see someone take an unwavering stand on a single issue, and more than 9/10ths of their posts are related to that issue... to me that&#39;s a shill.</p>

<p>What bugs me more than anything is that people don&#39;t realize how much influence is being exerted on what they read, what stories get promoted and which comments other people agree/disagree with.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a form of false advertising. You read the comments of whatever story and get of false impression of what others think. It&#39;s a well known phenomenon that most people will form an opinion that tends to reflect the perceived majority opinion. So, what&#39;s happening here is that false majority opinions are deliberately being created for the purpose of controlling the narrative.</p>

<p>Shills are a necessary component of this effort. If people were more aware of a) a concerted effort to manipulate their opinions and b) the methods being used... both the effort and the method would fail.</p>

<p>Spreading awareness would be good for reddit. But for whatever reason, most people (mods, admins and users) seem to be in a state of denial when it comes to the shill problem around here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often get labelled as a shill for pointing out flaws in people&#39;s arguments. I can understand that - people here are more paranoid and suspicious than the norm (I hope no one thinks that&#39;s a controversial opinion!), and then there&#39;s this guy coming along asking impertinent questions.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help it - if I see a claim that seems outrageous, I have to investigate it myself, and when I do I usually find it&#39;s riddled with holes. If I can find flaws quickly (and I do fairly often, although not always) it makes me question why they apparently haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>People however don&#39;t notice that there are plenty of threads <strong>I don&#39;t appear</strong> and rip on their arguments. There&#39;s a good reason for that - I probably haven&#39;t been able to find anything to disagree about. I do read just about 80 - 90% of the threads here (OCD on my part?), so realistically I comment rarely compared to the amount of ground I cover. Some stuff (like the flat earth type parts don&#39;t really hold my attention).</p>

<p>But because I don&#39;t go on about those parts much, I suppose people will only remember the disagreement.</p>

<p>I should get around to listing the conspiracies that I do get behind sometime. At least I could wave it back at people who ask that question, although I generally go blank because I don&#39;t really follow main of the mainstream (not the best word, popular?) conspiracies, and my interests are specific rather than general.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot easier to notice something new that didn&#39;t used to be there. And it&#39;s a lot harder to notice what isn&#39;t there, that used to be.</p>

<p>When you see someone who is capable of noticing changes like this, you&#39;re looking at someone who&#39;s really paying attention. Quite often it&#39;s older people who notice missing thins because they&#39;ve been around a lot longer and have learned to see the patterns.</p>

<p>If you can make this kind of observation (that people don&#39;t notice stuff like this) that&#39;s a good talent to have and you should practice it as much as you can.</p>

<p>I wish you hadn&#39;t used the word shill so many times. The first thing I think when I see somebody do that is that they have a low IQ and then I generally try to ignore them. Remove that word from your vocabulary . It&#39;s a tainted term that garners no credibility.</p>

<p>If I was an organization who hired shills, I would purposefully spread idiotic accusations across the internet calling everyone a shill so that people associate the word with stupidity and never take the claim seriously.

<p>It seems like a lot of people are conditioned to have a similar response to yours. You hear the word &quot;shill,&quot; you automatically assume everything around the word is bullshit. I hope you are better than that and actually decide to read the information I have presented here.
