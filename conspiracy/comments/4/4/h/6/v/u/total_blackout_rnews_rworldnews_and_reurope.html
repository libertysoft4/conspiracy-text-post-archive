    <div class="md"><p>The difference is, in western culture we ALL know it&#39;s wrong and the majority of our population believes that and follows the more-or-less unified moral code. Yes, some will still do it, but discreetly in the dark corners, whereas in their culture just take a look at the majority view and standpoint on women, if they are wearing anything less than a damn queen-size throw they&#39;re considered an abomination in the eyes of the lord which therein becomes the eyes of the people (their society).</p>

<p>It&#39;s much like North Korea mate, generations fed a certain logic/thinking/morals and they think that&#39;s right because they have no other information to tell them differently, especially depending on the range of their freedom when it comes to information and knowledge (internet restrictions, ect.)</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, 3rd world countries are 3rd world countries for a big reason, sure there are a lot of underlying factors contributed to outside influence, however the majority of the case it&#39;s just the fact that some cultures honestly are less civilized than others due to the majority populations viewpoints on morals and standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A downvote and no constructive criticism, I post for the first time on these forums with a structured argument with sound logic and it&#39;s viewed as negative. That&#39;s the problem, people will see something that might resonate sense within them or get offended because they can&#39;t argue against it and just try to push it away without first giving their own logic or defensive standpoint against it. We&#39;re all (I&#39;d like to assume) grown ass adults, we should be able to relay our opinions and standpoints based on logic and observation without blind aggression and bias, I myself would love to hear an argument against my statement to go with that downvote, because at least we&#39;re communicating and learning from each other&#39;s views and morals AKA a constructive conversation/debate. </p>

<p>Whereas with that downvote I just see someone upset they can&#39;t come up with a logical arguement and the simple &quot;UR DUM&quot; cannot be used without making yourself look like an ignoramus. </p>

<p>EDIT; Also from Reddit&#39;s FAQ&#39;s; UpVote -If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it. </p>

<p>Is it me, or have Downvotes become something very similar to likes on Facebook. Downvotes are meant for posts not relevant to the subject discussion, which raises the question, were we not discussing the migration of refugees and their impact on rape statistics as well as the coverup in media and social sites of such? I believe that link to Irony should have been placed here.</p>

<p>Oh just shut up.</p>

<p><strong>As the nation became increasingly involved in the slave trade from the sixteenth century onwards, one of the by-products was the importation of a small number of unwilling Africans[25] and by the beginning of the seventeenth century there was an established African community in England.</strong></p>

<p><strong>People also came to Britain from the Indian Sub-Continent from the 18th Century onwards,[49] with the importation of domestic workers from India becoming more popular in the 19th century</strong></p>

<p>Anyone brought into a country under slavery will be just that; Slaves. So until the law changes or the next generation/offspring of slaves are born, they aren&#39;t a part of the population, nor something that heavily influences that country&#39;s society/culture other than the fact slavery is happening and it&#39;s accepted in that society to some point. (Unless in cases of western worlds where it does happen, but it&#39;s underground due to the fact that the perpetrators know what they&#39;re doing is wrong and will face harsh punishment if discovered due to OUR society&#39;s/culture&#39;s laws against it) </p>

<p>Which leads to the next generation, even if they were born of whatever descent, more than likely they will be raised and taught by the country they are IN&#39;s standard morals and ethics. Just like America, they may have whole percentages of citizins of other country origins, but more than likely the majority were born and raised there, thus, were brought up and raised in that belief system. Even if their parents try to raise them differently, unless they are completely sheltering the child, the child is going to see the way the country&#39;s people act and behave, whereas those raised in ass-backwards societies will think that&#39;s the norm and have no contradicting information to say different.</p>

<p>Which is where refugees come in, children are a different story, but when you&#39;re taking in people who have lived 20+ years in these cultures, and then just letting them go freely without any form of integration or even a quick Dummy&#39;s guide to the country your moving to, there&#39;s going to be some issues. </p>

<p>Well, I think the point is just that foreigners have been settling in Europe and Britain for a long time. Whether they come here initially as refugees or as slaves doesn&#39;t really affect the dangerously false idea that they are somehow predisposed to rape and/or violence.</p>

<p>Before I continue, this is not a case of ignorant &#39;Murica&#39;s debate &quot;SEND &#39;EM BACK OVER THE BOARDER, THEY&#39;RE TAKING OUR JOBS AND FORCING US TO SPEAK THAT THARE SPANGLANESE, WE&#39;RE AMERICA, SPEAK AMERICAN.&quot; </p>

<p>We&#39;ll take a step back to what I said about some cultures are less civilized than others, the cultures these refugees come from are heavily influenced by a religion that clearly states &quot;Men are above the women.&quot; with that, we have already established that something a majority of people follow blindly is telling them to accept the fact that a human being made out of the same exact material, liquids, and matter as you and me is lesser. </p>

<p>THAT IS FLAWED LOGIC. Period. </p>

<p>I agree with you completely. The sheer numbers coming through are causing a big strain and of course, the more people there are then the more criminals there are. However, the reason these refugees need to come to Europe in the first place is because we have either overtly or covertly turned their homeland into a warzone by following the foreign policies of the United States. It is the same group of people who pushed those policies onto us, who are now spreading racial hatred and calling for a complete ban on immigration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems like a misconstrued use of my wording, while yes, with rising number in population, so does the rise of crime rates as well as every other statistic based on the amount of stuff the general population does, that&#39;s just logic.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is the main ideology of the refugees aka &quot;Islamic Law&quot; or &quot;Sharia&quot; (Saudi Arabia&#39;s main driving force) is 99% what they&#39;ve seen, encountered, lived with, practiced themselves, ect. You do not see diversity of religion, beliefs, morals, or laws in those areas, that sort of behavior or thinking gets you killed. So when they aren&#39;t educated on the laws and norms of new country they are moving to, more likely than not, they&#39;re going to continue acting and believing the same way they did in their system.</p>

<p>I am not against diversity of religion or beliefs, but I am against any form of law, government, or religion that promotes/puts any human above one another, as well as conditioning it&#39;s followers into believing this ideology and practicing it. I feel at this point in the development in humanity, everyone being equal (humans made of stuff) should just be common knowledge and an accepted fact, and anything that preaches differently should just be viewed as a plague and delay to the betterment of humanity.</p>

<p>So if a country is offering sanctuary, I believe the least those seeking it can do is agree to be given a form of condensed K-12 class of that countries education, laws, and morals in hopes to change any form of outdated views. Yes, reeducation,  I know that&#39;s a scary word for some.</p>

<p>Firstly, I reject your premise that in general Muslims cannot or do not adapt to local European laws. Secondly, even if your premise is correct, then if they want to use Sharia law within their own community, and are happy to do so, then who on God&#39;s Earth do you think you are to tell them they cannot do that? You are not part of their community. You are not visiting their mosques or marrying their children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe what Slanderson77 is trying to get is this:</p>

<p>If you leave your home country, for any reason, you should take it upon yourself to understand the new culture, and set of laws you will have to abide by. I&#39;m sure that most refugees do adapt to the change of culture, and try to blend in with the rest of the citizens in their new country. However, there are A LOT that do not. </p>

<p>For example, take a refugee from country A. They are going to be moving to country F. Now country A and country F both have a very different environments (laws,culture, etc). Wouldn&#39;t you think that someone from country A should learn and understand Country F&#39;s laws? Their morals? Where they stand as a country? </p>

<p>Im not saying that they shouldn&#39;t be able to practice their religion. Not at all. I myself believe that as human beings we are all equal in our right to practice whatever religion we want. However, when they use that religion to justify breaking laws, something needs to be done. That something could be as easy as just educating the refugees on what they are doing, and how in their homeland that may be okay, but here its not. </p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to spend the night at your friends house. You two are the complete opposite, yet somehow you&#39;re friends. Now, when you&#39;re at your friends house, do you abide by their parents rules? Since you are a guest? Or do you do as you please?</p>

<p>Bottom line: You cant take two conflicting cultures and smash them together without backlash from one end. The refugees, even if no one wants to admit it, they are a guest. These countries took it upon themselves to shelter them, to protect them, and to ultimately save them in the face of danger. </p>

<p>If you leave your home country, for any reason, you should take it upon yourself to understand the new culture, and set of laws you will have to abide by.

<p>A LOT isn&#39;t a number. It&#39;s an abstract device you&#39;ve invented to excuse your own bias. You can&#39;t expect to import thousands of people without any of them being criminals. That&#39;s quite literally retarded. We have plenty of criminals among our own population who don&#39;t give a shit about law and order, yet these guys don&#39;t seem to worry you because they aren&#39;t Muslim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying, which is okay. Of course, among thousands of people there are going to be criminals. No shit, Sherlock. That&#39;s common sense. </p>

<p>What Im saying is that they people who are receiving asylum should RESPECT the country that is providing it by NOT raping their kids, burning their buildings down, and causing general chaos. They should respect the morals and ethics of the country. If they wanted to practice a less than civilized way of behaving, then they should have just stayed home. </p>

<p>Atheist? Muslim? Pagan? Christian? Catholic? I really dont give a flying fuck. Practice want you want, and believe what you want. I pride myself on being a very open-minded person, and have no problem with any religion as a religion. </p>

<p>What I do have a problem with is using your beliefs as a way to break the law. And on top of that, taking advantage of a horrible situation just for personal gain. Im not saying that all refugees are like this, and I believe I&#39;ve said that once before. </p>

<p>So, maybe next time, before you hop on a thread and put in your two cents, take a second. Actually think for a minute about what you&#39;re saying, and try to find an argument that doesn&#39;t misinterpret my words. </p>

<p>So you are saying that whites are under no obligation not to rape kids and burn buildings down? Just foreign immigrants? I fail to see that you have any point here, unless it is again to create the false myth that foreign immigrants are all rapists and arsonists.</p>

<p>I think it sums it up perfectly when you have to defend yourself with your &quot;credentials&quot; as to whether or not you can interpret what someone said says. I could easily use one of your defenses &quot;I read Journalism and stopped there.&quot;  Having a degree is fine and dandy sir, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of half-wit morons with a degree in something (Trump), that&#39;s why they have Devry (And please don&#39;t think that as an opening to go &quot;BUT MINE WAS AT HARVAAAARD T_T&quot;)) So it&#39;s good you can READ English, but not if you can&#39;t understand what the words represent together in a complete sentence, nor can you be argued with if you just skim what people say and blurt out nothing but arguments that take what we said and turn it around to the point we have to spend an entire post explaining our posts in even more detail.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Neither of us said anywhere that immigrants are obligated to Rape and burn down buildings, my original message from the beginning has been as simple as this, lemme try and simplify it as best as I can for you with examples;</p>

<p>America; We have laws against rape and the abuse and mistreatment of any human beings regardless of race, gender, or age. Americans; We&#39;re now conditioned to knowing that if we abuse, rape, or cause any harm to a person of any color, any gender, or anything else, we&#39;re going to be punished, society as a whole will look at us as monsters, and more than likely they will either learn from it or rot away in the American prison system.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia (Whom&#39;s influences, cultures, laws, ect extend far past that); We have laws that make it okay to arrest and/or beat/kill women for being outside without their man, or if they are wearing less than a sheet, ect. 
Syrians/Saudis; We&#39;re now conditioned to knowing that there is a difference in power/intelligence/freedom with just gender (And this extends the Nature Vs Nurture debate, they have both pushing this ideology if they were born and raised in this culture) </p>

<p>Just that information alone indicates a different way of thinking (conditioned as it may be, it still is) towards your fellow humans, while I&#39;m not saying that these immigrants are prone to violence and rape, their living conditions promote it, and the fact that we are trying to just integrate at large numbers without first educating these people properly, can worsen this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there is a solution, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s why most of the EU government is being quiet and saying they are doing the best they can, but at the very least they can start a program to educate, better than what programs (If any) they currently have. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to explain myself any further, you&#39;ve been the only person to even chip into this, and to this point I still cannot tell whether you are a Troll, someone with a blind and righteous ego, or both. So take this as a win to your ego if you need it, and get that last reply, but perhaps you&#39;ll at least do this for me in return, read all of this, your illusions of hubris shows here, as well as your other posts in other forums. You&#39;re quick to bashing someones intelligence as a starting argument, you&#39;ll say you&#39;re done with an argument the moment you see something you don&#39;t &quot;Agree&quot; with and just pass it off as &quot;Stupid&quot; or &quot;Quite literally retarded&quot;, a scientific/political/geographical/ect debate and discussion does not need or require insults as well as trying to trying to make people feel dumb for their opinions in attempts to drive them away, that&#39;s called censorship bud, I guess your journalism credentials truly do hold up.</p>

<p>How else would you like me to &quot;defend&quot; your implication that I don&#39;t understand basic English? Pointing out that I have a degree-level qualification in English seems quite a reasonable way to respond to your epic silliness. </p>

<p>i&#39;m not sure what your point is since ur really stupid. most arabians and muslims live in the middle east and in arabia. u quoted me and then made useless dipshit points to do...idk what exactly. if ur gonna quote me and then try to refute the quoted point of mine, try two things</p>

<ul>
<li><p>actually understand the quoted point</p></li>
<li><p>refute it properly</p></li>
</ul>

<p>maybe try not to be a retard while ur at it</p>

<p>muslims and arabs belong in their lands and they can rape children there all they want. they have zero right to be in europe and no right to rape kiddies. sure, whites rape kids sometimes as well but they do it in their lands. any kiddo rape done by an arab is one that never should have happened because they have zero right to be in europe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A downvote and no constructive criticism, I post for the first time on these forums with a structured argument with sound logic and it&#39;s viewed as negative. That&#39;s the problem, people will see something that might resonate sense within them or get offended because they can&#39;t argue against it and just try to push it away without first giving their own logic or defensive standpoint against it. We&#39;re all (I&#39;d like to assume) grown ass adults, we should be able to relay our opinions and standpoints based on logic and observation without blind aggression and bias, I myself would love to hear an argument against my statement to go with that downvote, because at least we&#39;re communicating and learning from each other&#39;s views and morals AKA a constructive conversation/debate. </p>

<p>Whereas with that downvote I just see someone upset they can&#39;t come up with a logical arguement and the simple &quot;UR DUM&quot; cannot be used without making yourself look like an ignoramus. </p>

<p>EDIT; Also from Reddit&#39;s FAQ&#39;s; UpVote -If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it. </p>

<p>Is it me, or have Downvotes become something very similar to likes on Facebook. Downvotes are meant for posts not relevant to the subject discussion, which raises the question, were we not discussing the migration of refugees and their impact on rape statistics as well as the coverup in media and social sites of such? I believe that link to Irony should have been placed here.</p>
