        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the documentary “We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook”, the mental aspect of the shooter was addressed. According to the official police report of the “Sandy Hook Shooting” there was no clear motive for Adam Lanza, the gunman. Quote “In an effort to fill the void of intention, blame was placed on Lanza’s claimed “mental illness”, despite the fact that no mental health records had been made public”. Unfortunately, “that did not stop the media, politicians, Sandy Hook parents, and the pharmaceutical industry from lobbying for and passing expensive mental health legislation.” </p>

<p>To make matters worse, his stated doctor, (Dr. Paul Fox) was removed of his medical license in July of 2012 due to sexual relations of his patients. He claims any record he had of Lanza’s health was destroyed as he fled the country to New Zealand, but still communicated with Connecticut Police.  So what I can conclude from the findings in the documentary is that there was no confirmed or diagnosed mental illness officially from Adam Lanza, so anyone referring to Lanza having a mental illness cannot officially confirm he actually did. So what I can say from my research is that mental illness reform and avocation from the Sandy Hook tragedy is misled.</p>

<p>Documentary: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0z275nQnM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0z275nQnM</a></p>

<p>The cited time mark for my info is around 2:24:00 hour mark</p>

<p>Amazing how people think one of the largest false flags in american history is real, all they need to do is watch a 2 hour documentary and they will see how fake it is. You do even a little bit of research and you quickly see how fraudulent it is....</p>

<p>Also, what was written above i submitted as a portion of one of my English papers, still waiting for the grade....</p>

<p>**EDIT: I know its old news, and might seem irrelevant but again, many people dont know that this was a hoax in and out </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medical records of dead people can be made public. However, thank you for confirming that the person who was born Adam Lanza, - <strong>but who now goes under the name Ryan Lanza</strong> - is still alive, and yes, he is entitled to keep his medical records private*.</p>

<p>So, TopMindsofReddit fanboi <a href="/u/120z8t">/u/120z8t</a>, it appears you may be a hardcore conspiracy theorist, and you didn&#39;t even know it... </p>

<p>*Which is fortunate because the whole Sandy Hook hoax would collapse if people clued up and realised that Adam Lanza was an only child who changed his name to Ryan after leaving high school. Adam/Ryan didn&#39;t die at Sandy Hook, and neither did anybody else.</p>

<p>&quot;Adam Lanza&quot; did not graduate from High School, and there are no videos of Ryan graduating from High School. There is a video on Youtube of Ryan accepting a bachelor&#39;s degree from his UNIVERSITY. I presume you never went to university, otherwise you would know they are not the same thing.</p>

<p>I guess we need to add the faculty at Quinnpiac to the tens of thousands of people who must have been in on the conspiracy.

<p>turns into an admission</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Adam Lanza&quot; did not graduate from High School, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another standard Hoaxer tactic: demand evidence that can&#39;t actually exist, then act like the inevitable absence of impossible evidence proves something. See also all the demands for video from the school&#39;s  non-existent surveillance system, or from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/43jolu/the_conundrum_for_the_defenders_of_the_newtown/">business which burned down over two years before the shooting</a>. </p>

<p>[Edit] And you&#39;re not even <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1369013/report-on-sandy-hook-shooting.pdf">right there</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>AL communicated his goal of graduating early from high school, and staff worked with him to assist with earning the necessary credits. By the beginning of AL’s junior year, he
had accumulated 11.5 credits towards the required 20 for graduation.  By the end of the year, he was credited with 21, which <strong>allowed him to graduate a year early</strong> and exit special education services</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess the lesson here is: just because there&#39;s no video, doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen. Pretty much like the Sandy Hook shootings, really. </p>

<p>Ryan supposedly is/was an accountant, that means graduations and some data of his career even tho new, none exists. and there was reporting near the time of him working for Spaceweather, that got dropped in favor of him being a wallstreet beancounter.</p>

<p>Adam is a specter or a ghost, some claim Adam became Ryan, but Ryan is as imaginary as Adam.</p>

<p>Fake divorce papers in two editions, one typed, one hand written, both have Ryan obviously added as an addition so as to make the Adam to Ryan transition seem legit. this is a distraction from the whole bunch being 100% fake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The story about the Libor connection, we are told now by some alternative media, has been DEBUNKED.</p>

<p>Oh, really now?</p>

<p>As you read this information about Peter Lanza and his work for GE, remember the context and the Obama connection:</p>

<p>U.S. Taxpayers Bailed Out G.E. For $182.5 Billion.</p>

<p>Back to Adam&#39;s Family:</p>

<p>Peter Lanza has been up to his neck, drowning, and waterboarded even - BY LIBOR!</p>

<p>That&#39;s right:</p>

<p>PROOF:</p>

<p>&quot;Peter Lanza, is the tax director for General Electric, a corporation that paid -$0- in Federal income taxes on $14.2 billion dollars in profits last year. Three of the employees from GE Capitol, the unit overseen by Lanza, were sentenced to time in prison on October 18th 2012 for Libor bid-rigging scheme. The men are the first to be sentenced as part of an ongoing investigation of bid-rigging in auctions. It just so happens that GE Capitol, Peter Lanza’s Unit, was the one involved in the bid-rigging schemes that used LIBOR rates to manipulate the municipal market.&quot;</p>

<p>Why would they be? Are they habitually released for spree shooters? The documentary is also being a little deceitful with that claim, not mentioning the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/22/nyregion/report-on-adam-lanza.html">114-page report</a> into his life before the shootings, released shortly before the doc came out, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/nyregion/before-newtown-shootings-adam-lanzas-mental-problems-completely-untreated-report-says.html">which concluded</a>, &quot;based on a comprehensive examination of the medical and school histories of Mr. Lanza,&quot; that he was “completely untreated in the years before the shooting” for psychiatric and physical ailments like anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was also deprived of recommended services and drugs. </p>

<p>I trust you mentioned this in your English paper. Because, I&#39;m afraid, <em>We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook</em> is far from compelling, containing many inaccuracies, irrelevancies and questionable conclusions. If that was your sole or even your main source of information, you&#39;re probably looking at an F. </p>

<p>I do. Just not in this sub or with this username. </p>

<p>Really uninterested in participating in echo-chambers. I&#39;d rather have my worldview challenged and tested: both about the things I believe in, and the things I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>proving that SHES was not a school in 2012, barely proves it ever was a school for small children, more likely part of Fairfield Hills decade or two before. it reeks of a hospital adult training facility with its ROUND windows on doors, its armored windowed reception room.</p>

<p>what kindergarten/elementary schools in the real world have their bathrooms marked &#39;Men&#39; and &#39;Women&#39; with industrial kick plates on the door. small K3 children do not kick doors open as a rule, their body masses and leg strengths do not allow for this, not to mention its rude.</p>

<p>Not at all. There is a wealth of documentation from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sandy+hook+elementary+school&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=883&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F13%2F2012&amp;amp;tbm=">before the shooting</a>, showing a fully-functioning educational establishment.</p>

<p>[Also worth noting at the above link: other web pages, clearly written after the events, with date-stamps as early as August 2008. This obvious inaccuracy destroys a major plank of the conspiracy argument, the use of Google- and Bing-provided dates as evidence of foreknowledge]</p>
