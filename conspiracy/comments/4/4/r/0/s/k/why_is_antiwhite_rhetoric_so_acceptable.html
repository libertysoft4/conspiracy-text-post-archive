        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A common theme you see on social media among groups of people who are not Caucasian is aggressive anti-white rhetoric.</p>

<p>A few examples I&#39;ve read today and it&#39;s only early:</p>

<p>&quot;Successful blacks are always told or shown to humble themselves in ways their white counterparts are often not&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Racism in the south is different than up north&quot; (referring directly to white prejudice against black people)</p>

<p>&quot;Boy is a white racist word. Clearly, you didn’t watch enough ‘Good Times.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you&#39;re not black, you can&#39;t tell me about black people. I don&#39;t respect, acknowledge, or want to hear it. Shut the fuck up.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is it that Caucasian people have been stigmatized (for the most part) about speaking this way about other races, but &quot;minorities&quot; don&#39;t feel they are in the wrong in their way of thought for these types of allegations (which are becoming excessively abundant)?</p>

<p>Do people not understand that if they replaced the word white with their own race, they would be offending themselves? This is prejudice.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t use the word &quot;always&quot; to describe the way groups of people think.</p>

<p>Which white people are at fault?</p>

<p>Germans? Italians? Australians? Southern Americans? French Canadians? Swedes?</p>

<p>The world isn&#39;t white vs black.</p>

<p>For now, just imagine this statement. &quot;If you&#39;re not white, you can&#39;t tell me about white people. I don&#39;t respect, acknowledge, or want to hear it. Shut the fuck up.&quot;</p>

<p>edit: for typos</p>

<p>Update: And what is with all this Super Bowl race baiting? the game wasn&#39;t white vs. black either. cam newton throw the ball to GREG OLSEN (a white guy). CJ Anderson was the RB for the Broncos (a black guy). Both many Caucasian and African American players played for both sides, why are people focused on 1 position &amp; race?</p>

<p>MANY great African American players WON the Super Bowl last night. Don&#39;t do this!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A common theme you see on social media among groups of people who are not Caucasian is aggressive anti-white rhetoric.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine that you&#39;re five years old. You have another five year old friend, let&#39;s call her Suzy. You and Suzy both want a cookie, but you&#39;ve been told to stay out of the cookie jar--because it would spoil your dinner. You understand that disobeying is wrong and, because they&#39;re not <em>your</em> cookies, simply taking them without asking (stealing) is wrong too. Well, Suzy decides she wants a cookie anyway. You remind her of all of this and she tells you &quot;No, that&#39;s only <em>you</em>. It&#39;s okay if <em>I</em> get a cookie, <em>because I said so</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Most of us were taught from a young age that discrimination for arbitrary reasons (race, religion, creed, sexual orientation) is ignorant, wrong, and you should judge people individually as opposed to in groups. Most of us were also taught <em>critical thinking</em> in school--how to dissect an issue, look at it from every angle, and see where the problem lies. The problem here lies in the fact that certain groups are trying to redefine certain types of discrimination and/or crimes (racism and rape, for instance) to only apply under certain conditions.</p>

<p>For instance, racism has been redefined from &quot;discrimination against someone on the basis of race&quot; to that plus &quot;<em>from a position of power and/or privilege!</em>&quot; Now, nowhere in <em>that</em> definition does it say white people are the only ones who can be racist--you have to delve deeper for that, but not much. Because white people, <em>by virtue of being born Caucasian</em>, are inherently born into power and privilege, whereas <em>everyone else</em> is a disadvantaged, underprivileged minority in need of protection. Like I said, you don&#39;t have to dig deep. The <em>honest</em> ones will just come right out and say &quot;only white people can be racist.&quot; Any <del>black</del> <em>person of color</em> being <del>racist</del> mean to white people is only them getting social justice. &quot;It&#39;s okay for me to do it, because I said so!&quot;</p>

<p>Likewise, rape has been redefined from &quot;sexual acts with someone against their will&quot; to &quot;penile penetration against a person&#39;s will.&quot; Only men can rape, because only men have penises. Never mind coercion (which is still rape if a man does it), or holding a gun on someone (well, you got an erection so you must have enjoyed it). &quot;Women can&#39;t rape, because we said so! Also, we&#39;d never lie about being raped, ever, so treat every rape accusation as 100% real!&quot;</p>

<p>And just like with that five year old, you can&#39;t argue with these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically, The Dutch created the system that enforced slavery of Africans. Also, i will point out that Africans captured Africans and sold them to white slavers. If you are looking for a particular person or group, you are going to have a tough time. There wasnt a bunch of white people running around Africa with nets, Slavery was already a system and bi-product of the spoils of war and tribes of Africa often sold off defeated tribes to slavers. So there is both a supply and a demand, both are at fault. If anything blame the economic systems that made slavery such a profitable concept</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dutch Slavers are the ones who created the system to bring African Slaves to the U.S. the demand side of the economy was definitely Euro-Americans and whites, but there is also the supply side. Anti-White rhetoric is acceptable because everyone worries about the Demand for slaves in an economy and rarely looks at the atrocities of their own people that enslaved them. Slavery is a world wide and ubiquitous phenomenon, but White people are constantly placed as a bogeyman to all other as a figure head for their oppression and lack of achievement in a system. I will say that a lot of people have made the argument that the consistent domination and achievement of europeans is a sign of genetic superiority. Which is think is a bit outrageous, but its hard to argue with history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sad part is that African Americans have been convinced to think of themselves as merely African rather than what part of Africa.

I&#39;m a fourth generation immigrant on my mothers side and we have artifacts and belongings of our European heritage. </p>

<p>No African American can say that. They were traumatically ripped from their homes and their culture. Their entire culture is manufactured and manipulated by their former masters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best analogy I can think of is this:</p>

<p>Imagine you&#39;re in a high school where there are 10 very popular kids and 3 very unpopular kids. The popular kids bully the unpopular kids all the time. Everyday, the popular ones face no sort of prejudice or hardships within the confines of the school. They&#39;re treated well and with respect. The unpopular kids are looked down upon, though no one can really pin point a particular reason as to why. </p>

<p>Suddenly, another kid realizes &quot;Hey, popular kids! That&#39;s not cool what you&#39;re doing to those 3 over there!&quot;. So the popular group cuts down on the harassment, since it&#39;s losing them their status as the other students in the school begin to agree that what they were doing is wrong. </p>

<p>The three unpopular kids, however, still had to go through all the BS the popular kids caused them. They are going to continue disliking/being vocal about it until everything eventually plateaus. The other students understand the unpopular kids&#39; disdain. It is more accepted because, <em>man</em>, those popular kids really put them through a number. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not equating white = popular, black = unpopular for any reason but the purpose of this analogy. </p>

<p>I truly hope and believe we will eventually reach that plateau. We just have a long way to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your analogy, but fear that the idea of us being different is just a diversionary tactic.</p>

<p>There are many poor black people, yes.
There are many poor white people, yes.
There are many poor arab people, yes.
There are many poor asian people, yes.</p>

<p>There are many rich black people, yes.
There are many rich white people, yes.
There are many rich arab people, yes.
There are many rich asian people yes.</p>

<p>It seems the scapegoating white society for problems everyone has is an acceptable solution. People treat each other poorly, this is not racial.</p>

<p>People claimed the violence in Maryland last year was the result of white oppression.</p>

<p>The state prosecutor, some of the arresting police officers, and the chief of police (and the president) were all black, yet white people were still the source of the problem. It seems many sides (just like in war) find it easier to blame other people than actually resolve the issues within their own communities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you even have to think about this shows that you have not opened up your mind. Until the majority of the white race wakes up and can stop being blind, it will never stop. </p>

<p>While I hear my white friend compliment the acts of their ancestors on a daily basis (genocide, slavery, etc.) and even take the occasional laugh with them about it. What I am truly trying to do by hanging with them is open their eyes. I know that if I stick around as long as possible, I can help one or two wake up.</p>

<p>You need to wake up, blood is on the skirt of your genes. If you can&#39;t see that and stand up and say hey I acknowledge there was the wrong stuff done, then you are apart of the problem. This isn&#39;t to say you were a slave driver, NO, it is to show you the wrong of your ancestors and to not further replicate such ideas. That way, we can all live in peace.</p>

<p>The only time someone would say the following</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For now, just imagine this statement. &quot;If you&#39;re not white, you can&#39;t tell me about white people. I don&#39;t respect, acknowledge, or want to hear it. Shut the fuck up.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is after a white friend or acquaintance has said some really dumb stuff. You usually don&#39;t get this response unless you have truly said something that has offended someone. Basically, you have went beyond a intelligent discussion and tapped into the white <strong>EGO</strong>, and instead of actually listening, you have closed yourself down into a &quot;I&#39;m right, you are wrong&quot; mentality. </p>

<p>This is because of <strong>white privilege</strong> a normal reaction to being on top of any social economical pyramid. The mentality behind this is because the structure of the world is based on European supremacy, in other words, white power rules the world. You are so blind you can&#39;t even see that racism is nothing more than a border to separate black from white.</p>

<p>Why do you think the campaign of demonizing the refugees is so strong? Because they know if multiculturalism wins, it makes the white supremacy movement weaker and thus, they lose one diaphragm of the pyramid. When everyone mixes, everyone will look the same, then race will have no power, they will look to religion and class, but what happens when you abolish religion? There is only one left, <strong>class</strong>.</p>

<p>So now when when poor atheist mixed guy looks over to the right to ask his brother who is also a poor atheist mixed guy who&#39;s fault is their current condition, the brother will reply, <strong>&quot;I know it is not me and it&#39;s not you, so it must be them (Top of the pyramid).</strong></p>

<p>Thus a one world government will work in favor since there will only be the haves and the have nots. Securing future revolutions against a one world government while at the same time creating one.</p>

<p>There.</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;ve subtracted from the truth, instead of you admitting that white racism exist, you&#39;ve ran into a hole where you get to say &quot;I&#39;m not the problem&quot;. No, it&#39;s not about you, it&#39;s about the fact that you won&#39;t acknowledge that white racism exists, thus you have just contributed to white supremacy. </p>

<p><strong>Do you see how this mentality works and why so many are against it?</strong></p>

<p>If you will not stand up against white supremacy then you have empowered it. Since it your European leaders who control the reigns of your flock, all who submit to such privileges while also <em>abstaining from the admittance of it&#39;s guilty pleasures</em> have subconsciously already empowered white supremacy. Do not turn your guilty pleasures into a flight or fight response, instead, read, research these things. ** Personal denial of such things will not get you far when those at the top of the pyramid know exactly what is happening.** </p>

<p>Yes, growing up black in America is very hard, you have to work harder, live harder and be judged harder than your white counter parts while also acknowledging that you are the few and far that escaped the hole, much like bane in the batman movie. </p>

<p>Do Europeans run these countries or not? European Jews run SA/Turkey/Syria, Europeans have secretly attempted to infiltrate China for the longest period ranging back almost <strong>1000 years</strong> by owning many of the publications and schools.</p>

<p>Iran is a enemy of the united states for one major reason (it&#39;s not controlled by Europeans) but has recently been given a new perspective, you don&#39;t need to guess it because the answer is logical, Obama, a black man is in office and Brazil is controlled by Europeans via the WAR ON DRUGS. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, it wasn&#39;t me who had offended anyone, simply a comment that I had passively observed (until making this post).</p>

<p>None of my comments stated that you were at fault, they spoke on the question in your thread, it is aimed at your thinking and perspective. I was breaking down your inner thread question by the fact that the only time you would hear those words would be when you&#39;ve said something that was offensive. Due to how the human mind reads, when we read we tend to personalize because words like &quot;I, you, we&quot; are personal to the human brain.</p>

<p>People are referring to this because of the subliminal change they are feeling happening in America. No longer are the blacks sitting at their original designated spot of the lower part of the pyramid. The only thing the European power structure at the top can do is bring a race war about. So they send signals in the media, that is all you are feeling. Although, if whites would simply start to understand where minorities are coming from, then such things would not be possible. It is only the whites ego that they hold on to so hard that a race war would actually be possible.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that blacks were never supposed to escape that infuriates the elite Europeans it is also the fact that whites, are now living in a country where everyone has been equalized to what we used to consider &quot;poor&quot; that they have gone bat shit crazy.</p>

<p>I personally believe it&#39;s the idea that whites could be poor and have very little and still be happy because they always had the &quot;well at least I aint black&quot; mentality. Sense introduction to the ground zero parallel, whites seem to have lose it completely. </p>

<p>In the words of Katt Williams </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I can, but unfortunately, white racism is so much more powerful because if you&#39;ll look up at the top, it&#39;s mostly white. Therefore, the people who control majority of the money are in fact white. Therefore those same people lead secret societies that predominately white and worship supremacy laws that are for people that are majority white.</p>

<p>If you could parallel that with blacks, I&#39;d say black systematic racism exist. Sadly, all I can do is call you a cracker which is really a derogatory term for myself because all cracker means is white guy who cracked a black man with a whip.

<p>It was supposed to be derogatory in the sense that when a white man walks, his white pride uplifts him so much that he has a certain demeanor about him.</p>

<p>It obviously isn&#39;t as derogatory as slavery because the meaning even behind this word is that you are white. Now some whites ranging from the lower social economical areas might find the term a bit more offensive because they walk talk and pretty much are of the current &quot;Black&quot; archetype society has labeled black people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From 1 google and wikipedia.</p>

<p>Honky may be a variant of hunky, which was a deviation of Bohunk, Honky (also spelled honkie or sometimes honkey) is mainly a derogatory word for white people, predominantly heard in the United States. The first recorded use of honky in this context may date back to 1946, although the use of &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; occurred in films well before that time.[1] The exact origins of the word are generally unknown and postulations about the subject vary although it is believed that Glenn Fraser of Greenock, Scotland, was largely involved in its rise to infamy in that town in particular.a slur for Bohemian-Hungarian immigrants in the early 1900s.[2] </p>

<p>Honky may have come from coal miners in Oak Hill, West Virginia. The miners were segregated; blacks in one section, whites in another. Foreigners who could not speak English, mostly from Europe, were separated from both groups into an area known as &quot;Hunk Hill&quot;. These male laborers were known as &quot;Hunkies&quot;.[3]</p>

<p>I have more questions though.</p>

<p>What about hillbilly?
Redneck?
Whitey?
In asia they call caucasians gweilo (or pale ghost)</p>

<p>Did you read what you wrote? The word again became popular for blacks to use during the hit TV sitcom, George Jefferson. </p>

<p>But what is your point to all this madness? How does honky in any form of the definition, equal up to the N-word which equated to centuries of slavery, hanging, dismemberment, beatings, raping, separation of family, separation of heritage, separation of last name, separation of culture. </p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s right, almost the majority of blacks in America, have no idea where they come from or who their family was. Literal cultural genocide by amnesia, I wonder what would make people do something so evil. To erase an entire race.</p>

<p>Because whites were so welcome from Turkey to South Africa...</p>

<p>At various times through our sordid history, that could be said about any color of person. Humans are consistently stupid and make bad decisions. But we have to fail in order to learn how to overcome, or how to not make the same mistake.</p>

<p>If we punish ourselves for every failure mankind has ever committed, we&#39;d never get anything done. We&#39;d accomplish this just as our sense of smugness suffocates the last free thought.</p>

Every race has been enslaved and colonized, only black people in modern America cant get over it.

Jews got holocausted and it only took them a few years go start outperforming whites in the US.</p>

<p>Your additude is the problem. Omg when will white people stop being so oppressive! Go somewhere else or deal with it, every other race seems to be able to do that. If you&#39;re black you have a whole continent, whites are a worldwide minority and easy to avoid. Oh wait the only good black countries to live in are the ones that got colonized.

    <div class="md"><p>Please. The problem with the white race is we take shit from people like you. You know over one million white people were enslaved in the Barbary slave trade and taken into Africa? That&#39;s more than the number of African slaves taken to America. There are no descendants of those white slaves in North Africa because they were raped and worked to death. Meanwhile America has plenty of slave descendents because that&#39;s not how we roll.</p>

<p>We invented western culture, one of the only cultures on the planet that doesn&#39;t treat women like literal property (could be the only one FYI). We colonized sure, bad things happened, but today in Africa there is a direct correlation between standard of living and time colonized. Every race on Earth capable practiced conquest, but the same statement about standard of living increase correlation cannot be said for Japanese colonies, or the colonies or conquested area of any other race. The best countries were colonized the longest and the lowest countries were never colonized.</p>

<p>Our crimes as a race are not unique, however our contribution is. It&#39;s not about better or worse but the white race is unique. There are no non-white western countries and all white countries are Western. If you had to be born a poor woman anywhere on earth you would always pick a white country.</p>

<p>It is time for White people to start acting like every other race. White people should enjoy and be proud of their heritage, just like every other race.</p>

<p>In short, please fuck off with your bullshit. If you live in a Western country, you&#39;re a hypocritical bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because white racism still exist. </p>

<p>Why do you think when multiculturalism tries to exist, it doesn&#39;t work?</p>

<p>Because the countries that have been used to do so, have been held down and back by white supremacy. Go look to any African country, middle eastern country, any country in the world where they are dark or brown skinned. Show me how Europeans aren&#39;t in control of said country and I will go redo my research.</p>

<p>Dumbing down the youth and keep them down, ignorance is the weapon used against minorities now. Don&#39;t educate them so they can never rise. Systematic warfare that exist all around the world. Let me know if your statistics even touch a surface of what has been mentioned here.</p>

<p>Show me your research papers. Link them, I want to see if they if speak on this even a little or do they say, these people fully control their country, rich and simply don&#39;t want to educate the youth?</p>

<p>We know Africa is fully colonized.</p>

<p>We know Nazi&#39;s have their hands in the middle east.</p>

<p>What country isn&#39;t held back? Oh I know India, and look at it, it&#39;s blossoming into a world power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if you think white people are such a problem, with white privilege and white supremacy and toxic Western culture that needs to be dismantled, but you&#39;ve chosen to live in a white country, then you&#39;re a hypocrite. I think Western culture is the best, so I live in a Western country. If I was born into another culture I would move into a Western country, I wouldn&#39;t sit around in Africa talking shit about black people and their culture, I would move.</p>

<p>White people build a certain kind of society. This is why all white countries and Western and all Western countries are white. If you&#39;re opting to live in the type of society only white people create while talking shit about them and working to dismantle their culture, you&#39;re just a cancerous cell, you&#39;re just a hypocrite. There are many, many, non-white countries, but most people like you choose to live in a Western country and talk shit rather than move to get away from these white people that bother you so much.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because Western countries are the most free and best to live inYou&#39;reou had to choose to be born as a poor woman anywhere 99% of people would choose a white Western country. If you had to choose to be gay anywhere you would most likely pick a white western country. As documented below we also treated our slaves (slavery was unfortunate) better than other cultures (for example there are no white descendents from the barbary slave trade left in Africa, all raped and worked to death. Slave descendents abound in America because that&#39;s not how we roll). Even our colonies (colonialism was unfortunate but conquest was practiced by all races that were able) enjoy a standard of living increase directly proportional to time colonized, something that can&#39;t be said for the colonised or conquested areas of any other race. Western culture is obviously great which is why so many non-whites flood every non-western country that will take them. Most of them are thankful and dont use their new Western style freedons to shit talk white people and actively work against Western culture. You&#39;re welcome, BTW. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you try going to live in sub Saharan Africa where before being contacted by other races they failed to invent an alphabet, a calander, any farming techniques, domesticated no animals, had no two story building, no wheel, NOTHING. Go there and then come back and talk shit about Western culture. I don&#39;t think they should be forced to be Western but Western countries shouldn&#39;t be forced to be anything else either. Hey there is one place in sub Saharan Africa that isn&#39;t a shithole, South Africa - a formerly first world nation that had nuclear weapons. Then white people handed the country to black people and all colleges and PhD programs have an 80% drop out rate and they burn trash in the street.</p>

<p>All races should be proud of their history, this includes white people. I believe all races should be proud and steward their own destinies without listening to bullshit from people like you.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s true. Persia is not in sub Saharan Africa. This statement applies to NO OTHER RACE aside from sub Saharan Africans. You can&#39;t attribute this historical fact to racism.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t see the irony of your macro assertion: the Japanese and other races did well because they had homelands, so Europeans should give up their homelands and embrance multiculturalism. Europe embracing multiculturalism would be the death of Europe. Japan embracing multiculturalism would be the death of Japan, that&#39;s why they don&#39;t do it.

<p>Only your race has to fight tooth and nail to be accepted in OTHER RACES homelands because you are incapable of doing anything with Africa, the land God gave you that literally has more resources than you know what to do with. Look at Rome 2000+ years ago and look at any sub Saharan African nation today. The best architecture there is mud huts even a beaver is capable of constructing. Western culture embraces all people who want to get down with our values and way of life but if that&#39;s not what you want you can fuck off.</p>

<p>I want all races to be able to steward their own destinies, that includes white people. Your race has contributed almost nothing to the world which is why no MAINSTREAM SCHOLAR OR HISTORIAN teaches these bullshit theories about sub Saharan Africans inventing everything ever. I don&#39;t bring this up out of my Western sense of politeness but if you&#39;re going to spout bullshit that is attempting to dismantle my race and my culture, you can go drink room temperature milk out of a gourd in Africa like the LEADERS OF NATIONS were doing there less than a century ago.</p>

<p>Please tell your race to start owning up to their own shortcomings like every other race, and to actually contribute something to modern society like every other race. Please enjoy your white welfare money, which your race collects disproportionate to their demographic in every WESTERN country they inhabit. Must be racism.</p>

<li><p>Persia is in Africa, it&#39;s what Europeans now refer to as the &quot;Middle East&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost every African American here in America are not African. I am not Hamitic. The bible states this under the definition of Ham, third son of Noah, he was progenitor of the dark races, <strong>NOT THE NEGROES</strong> but the Ethiopians, Egyptians, Libyans. I am by means a hebrew and proud like King Solomon when he said, <strong>“I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The Jews today who claim to invent everything stole it from black Hebrews back during the black reign.</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t want to admit it that 400 years of free labor off the sweat, blood and tears of my people empowered you to a high social economical position. None of the 100 millions were paid, while you sit back and get better jobs at companies that financed slavery and overall every white position available. Denial will not get your mindset out of this, we must talk about these things and you need to be more open.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany never had any black slaves and lived off their exports, they were one of the most industrious nations of all time and were able to fight off at least 5 major Western countries due to their industriousness. I know you have built up this idea that white people need black people, but we really don&#39;t. Germany is a prime example of this. Slaves were only good for extremely labor intensive crops like cotton or tobacco and were otherwise useless and not worth their cost. We kept the descendents of obsolete farm equipment around as a courtesy to you, but mostly because we couldn&#39;t get it together enough to send you back to Africa.</p>

<p>The white race would be fine, in fact they would be better off without black people. Without non-white crime the US would have a similar violence rate to Scandinavian countries. Let&#39;s end this. The reason only black people believe the nonsense you are spouting is not because other races are brain washed but because someone could only believe this ridiculous bullshit with no evidence if it was putting them on a pedestal.</p>

<p>All races have things to be proud of but please leave denigrating my race out of it. I&#39;m done with this conversation. Please remember white people would be fine without black people. Do you think they had black slaves in Iceland and Russia and Bulgaria and serbia and Sweden and Germany and Finland and Norway and every single great white country ever? Lmao. Enjoy your continent of mud huts, jungle music and rape epidemics or shut the fuck up and acknowledge how great Western culture is. You&#39;re the kid in the back of the class who is failing and blaming it on everyone else with bullshit tales that literally no one believes. &quot;We were KINGS! Everything is white people&#39;s fault&quot;. I guess the Muslims had the right idea when they castrated their slaves before taking them across the Sahara, having you tend the tobacco plants was hardly worth all the bullshit we have to deal with now. Peace out loser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, wrong. The Germany you saw was funded by the labor of blacks from here in America. Thus the reasoning Hitler was funded by the same Jews he &quot;hated&quot; so much. Even Germany participated in the capture of blacks during the holocaust</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005479">http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005479</a></p>

<p>For the longest time, most of the money in the world has been controlled by a few European Families. Those same European families are the people who funded expenditures like slavery. Hell they even sent their most craziest men and women to the land we call America today. Which resulted in the almost extinction of two races. </p>

<p>The white race may be fine without the black race but since that has never happened. It is just a theory. For the last almost 600 years though, the white has shown it&#39;s dependency on free labor, dumbing down minorities and genocide. Hell after the recent genocide in the middle east (estimated 2.1 million slaughtered.) I don&#39;t see how you have any argument here. </p>

<p>You take this information and you get angry about the fact that you are living off the fruits and labor of others. That infuriates you so you result to, &quot;it&#39;s all about your attitude&quot; and other psychological retardation. </p>

<p>The fact still remains, slaves were never supposed to be free, let alone learn to read and write. </p>

<p>But god had other plans. </p>

<p>Open a book in your life for damn second rofl. No. 1600s Europeans were going around enslaving and genocide just like they are now. They had already enslaved blacks on their own homeland BEFORE the slave trade. You ever heard of colonization? </p>

<p>At various times through our sordid history, that could be said about any color of person. Humans are consistently stupid and make bad decisions. But we have to fail in order to learn how to overcome, or how to not make the same mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry your people&#39;s history is so barren that you have to be obsessed with mine. Every race has been enslaved and colonized, only black people in modern America cant get over it. We robbed everything from the Japanese and put them in camps 70 years ago and now they outperform whites. Jews got holocausted and it only took them a few years go start outperforming whites in the US.</p>

<p>Your additude is the problem. Omg when will white people stop being so oppressive! Go somewhere else or deal with it, every other race seems to be able to do that. If you&#39;re black you have a whole continent, whites are a worldwide minority and easy to avoid. Oh wait the only good black countries to live in are the ones that got colonized. How does that work in your worldview? YOU&#39;RE A JOKE.</p>
