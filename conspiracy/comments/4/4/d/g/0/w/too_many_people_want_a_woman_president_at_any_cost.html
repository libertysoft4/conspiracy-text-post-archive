        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lots of people mistake outward appearance for real progress. Take Obama for example. The man promised a lot of great things he never delivered on, and made a further mess of our relations in the ME (except with Iran, that&#39;s debatable). Sure, he&#39;s black, but so what? Who cares if the president is black? That doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s progress, it just means we&#39;re <em>ready</em> for a black president. </p>

<p>The same goes for Hillary. Too many people think that because she&#39;s a woman, she needs to be voted in so we can make &quot;real progress&quot;. What&#39;s the point of voting a woman president in if if she&#39;s only voted in because she&#39;s a woman? That&#39;s not to say that&#39;s the only reason people are voting for her, but the driving force? Absolutely. </p>

<p>When she debated Sanders, he called her pro-estalishment and her response was &quot;I don&#39;t see how a WOMAN could be pro establishment&quot;. In other words, she&#39;s a woman, and the establishment is male dominated, so she MUST be the right person for the job. </p>

<p>Give me a fucking break. </p>

<p>The US presidential election is a big circus, with two clowns in it and one person I have no idea what he stands for.
That&#39;s who you can vote for:</p>

<p>A nutter.</p>

<p>A liar woman. </p>

<p>Someone else, that will never win.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s democracy?</p>
