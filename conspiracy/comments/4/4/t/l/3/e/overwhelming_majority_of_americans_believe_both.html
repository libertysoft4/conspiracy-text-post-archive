        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">618</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-02-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LukeMeDuke.html">LukeMeDuke</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We’ve previously noted that polls show that Americans are in a “prerevolutionary” mood, that less than 1 in 5 Americans think that the government has the “consent of the governed”, that government corruption tops the list of Americans’ fears (gee, we wonder why), and that 3 times as many Americans supported King George during the Revolutionary War than support our OWN Congress today.</p>

<p>You might assume that such statements are over-the-top … or that the results come from partisan pollsters.</p>

<p>But a  group of Republican and Democratic pollsters and political strategists reviewed polling data last week, and revealed some stunning results:</p>

<ul>
<li>84% of all Americans believe political leaders are more interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right</li>
<li>81% percent believe the power of ordinary people to control our country is getting weaker every day as politicians of both parties fight to protect their own power and privilege</li>
<li>80% believe the federal government is its own special interest primarily looking out for itself</li>
<li>79% of all voters believe we need to recruit and support more candidates for office, at all levels of government, who are ordinary citizens, rather than professional politicians and lawyers</li>
<li>78% believe that the Democratic and Republican Parties are essentially useless in changing anything, because both political parties are too beholden to special interests to create any meaningful change</li>
<li>76% of Americans agree with the statement that America cannot succeed unless we take on and defeat the corruption and crony capitalism in our government</li>
<li>75% believe that the US government is NOT working for the people’s best interest</li>
<li>75% believe that powerful interests have used campaign and lobbying money to rig the system for themselves</li>
<li>74% see the biased and slanted coverage of the media as part of the problem</li>
<li>72% of Americans believe the U.S. has a two-track economy, where most Americans struggle every day, where good jobs are hard to find, and where huge corporations get all the rewards</li>
<li>72% believe that the reason families in our middle class have not seen their economic condition improve for decades and economic growth is stalled is because of corruption and crony capitalism in Washington</li>
<li>71% believe our government is not only dysfunctional, it is collapsing right before our eyes</li>
<li>70% believe the government in Washington does not govern with the consent of the people</li>
<li>The majority – 56% – say they wish there were a third party with a chance of success to fight for their interests</li>
<li>Only 15% say the “values and principals of my political party are so important that I strongly prefer to vote for the candidates of my party…”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>They concluded:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The country [is] in a prerevolutionary moment.</li>
<li>This election could mark the beginning of the end of two-party duopoly in the United States.</li>
<li>The people believe the real struggle for America is not between Democrats and Republicans, but between mainstream America and the ruling political elites of incumbent politicians, lobbyists, big business, big unions, big banks, big special interests and the big media.</li>
<li>The power elite asks, “When will this be over?” Although this is seen as a chaotic and temporary situation by most of the political and media establishment, our research shows a strong, evolving tidal wave of discontent and growing pressure for real and dramatic change.</li>
<li>Real change is what that the establishment fears most and fights hardest against. It is ultimately a losing battle.</li>
<li>This, in fact, is a revolution.</li>
</ul>

This sub does give me some hope though, at least some people are awake. It&#39;s good to know that even if most Americans are blind to our own woes, that some of my European brethren can appreciate just how badly us Americans are getting fucked. I hate to say it -- but I have the feeling you&#39;re next. </p>

<p>No one knows what to do. I stopped feeding into the corporate machine the best I could ten years ago, by getting rid of my television, cooking my own meals, not watching sports or going to movies, working for little pay at small businesses, but this often alienates me socially. There are those of us Americans who are trying to slow the corporate machine by not participating. I hope more will soon. </p>

Then the party is over. What&#39;s comforting is it seems like the majority of the US population understands this, and want no part of it.

<p>If it&#39;s legal, more people can buy it.  Nothing saying that the price has to even go down.  The sellers decide the cost initially, but when you&#39;re the big provider of the source (ie: the government itself), you can adjust the market price by adjusting the seller&#39;s initial price and assume a certain amount of markup.  That gives them monopolistic margin control</p>

<p>Down at the rabble-rousing level, those people are not going to be receptive to a revolutionary &#39;tear it down&#39; message <em>until their personal situation collapses</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>Obama was funded by wall street and super PACS. Sanders can&#39;t be bought. He is a purely grass roots organizer and the only one that wants to end the war on drugs, the prison industrial complex, and provide free healthcare/education. To boot, Obama was stonewalled in congress endlessly. He had the people behind him for a bried period under a vague concept of change that never manifested. Sanders has been exactly the opposite and has 30 years of performance to back him up.</p>

<p>my tax burden (or anyone making under 250k yearly, or 85% of Americans) will not increase with the college and healthcare I will get which has shown to be a positive ROI for the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your distinction, and I actually really like Bernie Sanders - I&#39;ve been a fan of his ever since he helped get the Fed audited in 2011. Nonetheless, his budget proposals regarding healthcare and education are totally unrealistic because they&#39;d never in a million years make it through Congress. Most of our  elected officials are beholden to the corporations and 1%ers who would supposedly foot the bill for everything. </p>

<p>Even if he were to be elected, he&#39;d be stonewalled even more by Congress than Obama has. The POTUS is just a figurehead at this point, anyway. The system is broken and there&#39;s no one person who can fix it within the current framework. IMHO. 😉</p>

<p>The hivemind doesn&#39;t like Ron Paul after seeing what corporations did to the world in a &quot;free market&quot;. I was on the RP choo choo train back in the day but I don&#39;t think I would be happy today if he won. </p>
