    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Isn’t the point of government to help it&#39;s citizens?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government–in pursuit of good intentions–tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost comes in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t mind paying more taxes so others can go to college without being in massive amounts of debt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that’s not at all how it works. Tuitions have exploded because of government loans. End all government loans and they’ll be forced back where they belong.</p>

<p>Retard McMoron has absolutely no right to get a worthless fucking degree in “gender studies” ON MY DIME and then go on the dole for the rest of his life ON MY DIME because no one sane would hire him.</p>

<p>If the government actually operated like it should, government loans would only be applicable for specific majors AND success therein. If you want a degree in 18th century Spanish lesbian poetry, you’re paying for it yourself. And if you fail your engineering classes, your government loan is revoked entirely.</p>

<p>PUNISHMENT FOR MISDEED. NOT REWARD.</p>

<p>“College is too expensive! Let’s just make it free lol!” is the exact same bullshit that happened with medicine and which has completely destroyed the system.</p>

<p>It’s literally the exact opposite.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>1) socialism only works when someone else is footing the bill. Your appeal to stupidity is meaningless, because we pay for Europe’s defense. That’s the only way they can have “free” healthcare. Note that their systems are collapsing entirely and their quality of care pales in comparison to ours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you really want human needs privatized?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, since that’s the only way costs go down. You pay for food and water, after all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That’s why I didn’t say that.</p>

<p>No, because those systems will be bankrupt and shut down before the end of the next decade.</p>

<p>No, governments did, otherwise your 9 year old would be working in a factory 60-80 hours a week. Regulated capitalism is fine, unregulated capitalism eats its young. And governments provide the infrastructure to allow capitalism to survive and profit.</p>
