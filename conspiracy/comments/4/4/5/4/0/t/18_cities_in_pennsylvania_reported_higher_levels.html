    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not really conclusive proof of that. From what I understand we are supposed to get our minerals from food, not water. The minerals in water don&#39;t absorb properly. Distilled water pulls out excess minerals that we don&#39;t need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember guys. If you believe someone that tells you that drinking pure water will be detrimental to your health, you have been duped. You would think that if the human body is 70% water, then the water you take in would should be only the purest. I also cook my food in Reverse Osmosis water and I distill my own water with a distiller I bought for $200 5 years ago. Even my dog gets only the finest distilled.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly if you arent drinking self filtered or distilled water you are crazy.</p>

<p>And stop using any flouride toothpaste and any deodorant with aluminum of any kind.  Baking soda is better and a stainless steel underarm rubbing stick is far cheaper.</p>

<p>Also EDTA is a cheap pill that attaches to lead in your body and can pull it out.</p>

<p>Malic acid is one of the few things that can penetrate the blood brain barrier and flush out hqrmful tpxons built up there like aluminum.</p>

<p>Going senile by forgetting names etc when getting older  at 40 and 50 is NOT normal.</p>

<p>Throw away any aluminum pans. Use iron or stainless steel or glass like pyrex cooking pans.</p>

<p>The healthcare system you will save later is your own. No society cantake care of so many mentally damaged people later in life.</p>

<p>You must protect and treat yourself before it gets bad.</p>

<p>And do i even need to say dont eat ANY sugar of any kind natural or not?</p>

<p>The secret life of plants is a load of pseudo scientific bullocks. </p>

<p>No, please re-read</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just straight up hilarious. Yeah, they&#39;re tricking you into spreading their genes like a drug dealer ergo it&#39;s bad for you. Great fucking logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if your intention is to keep your body in a state of homeostasis.</p>

<p>Eating sugar doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with this.  Our bodies are pretty fantastic machines and more than capable of dealing with a cherry or an apple or a can of jolt.</p>
