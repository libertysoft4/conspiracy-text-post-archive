    <div class="md"><p>Funny i did twice in my life one time after i was in church before i found out i was a monarch child. My first day going to church i heard an elctectronic robotic voice in my head loudly say &quot;Your God isnt real&quot; I knew then i was on the right direction. I i already disabled the chips. I went to jail a few weeks ago and they did implant another one, i dont know if i have disabled them successfully, i havent had any voice to skull but i do get technological induced dreams where cops ask me if i am hiding anything, pretty much i cant lie in those dreams and i know thats whats happening. Just stuff like that. A lot of it is spiritual attacks mixed with technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was right in the middle of my forehead, its safe to say lots of people have been chipped but these are passive chips. The mark of the beast is a more active chip, they need your full consent to acknowledge that you will serve the devil because God is a just God so that would defeat the putpose of dragging souls to hell. But use a neoydium magnet because even if you arent chipped these chemtrails release nano technology that are similar to chips, these can induce anxiety and many more things. But for me the mention of the word jesus or me trying to speak about my situation caused these chips along with the nano thecnology to make me confused as i speak, and it was amazingly difficult to talk i sounded like a schizo i would talk but very hard to complete a sentence, lot of it was also demonic. Look up 144,000 chosen, thats why i believe i cannot die either yet or maybe i will survive what the bible calls tribulation, be aware sometimes what many of the church preches sometimes isnt true, be like the 144,000 and follow Gods voice, just know God wont decieve you, please if you have anymore questions i would love to be helpful, really thats my duty as a follower of christ is too be an example of his love to be helpful, and caring, no man is perfect, but we strive to be perfect in the eyes of our lord. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not really sure i did at the age of 9 recieve Gods touch of his holy spirit is what we call it. It says in the bible holy spirit, that wasent part of the plan, but honestly i believe they knew since the beginning before I recieved God that God was with me, i remember when dissociating, right before nasty stuff was going on,(i dont remember but i remember moments before which also is vague, and at the same time i remember how the mind just broke, hid the memories, and technoloy and &quot;therapy used after to seal, hypnosis, with that swirling motion picture&quot;) but i remember feeling ot hearing a calming but bold voice gently tell me and comfort me with knowledge that things are gonna be okay. Really heart warming too me now that i remember, but i could have been being groomed for social movements during these endtimes, maybe i was shpposed to lead people with violent movement to riot and rebel, thats what I believe. After i recieved God as a kid i did go away and forget about him to fit in with the what we call world, i couldnt fit in anymore lots of &quot;friends seen the change and they despised me, and well that was there chance to start bring back the programming, so long story short after what we call sinning, i dug mysel in a hole, had many dark spiritual attachments(not possesion theres a difference) dealing with this feeling that i knew something was off in my life, and looking into my friends and every single person i knew and just not feeling they really cared ot loved me, that i was trapped in this weird cycle of sin and depression, i was full of fear, anger, pride, just bad things, came to God by a miracle, my &quot;family&quot; really showed their colors, they were slapping me as i prayed, just mocking God, i threw up nasty stuff during prayer and i knew demons were being casted out, i felt true love from God, i cherish that moment where my life turned, i didnt hear dark voices i didnt have evil thoughts, beautiful and now i am getting a clear picture of my life i wish i can talk to everyone in person its so much easier, but this will do.(im not sure if i ansewered your question but i have more details of my story and proof of why i knownGod exists) i am not afraid i have known already for a few months now, i have been banned on many sites because well secret societies own so much and it would be foolish to thing Gods enemies arent on this website. Its fine though Gods plan is coming to past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But my abuse that i know of was which i believe isnt my real family but i didnt know at the time, i dont who where and how i ended up here, but my fake family would for instance my mother figure molested me, her bf&#39;s older children molested me. My older brother and i dont remeber because i would mentally escape, i wasent in a lab cage being torutres it was made to look like regular normal abuse, sexual abuse is said to be similar to a vietnam vets trauma, its very traumatizing to a child, but i whopped that devil because you see me now and i m not affected by it whatsoever, the scar has shrank by only God all the credit too him, but i could have also have been just a beta sex slave for women and men, i was also being inteoduced to gang cultrue and big eats small type thinking where the weak are raped and the ones willing to resort to violence are manly, i was 10 when older kids(look up mk ultra clones this is what i am surrounded with) would pummel me and at kne point physically wrestled me and sexually assaulted me, it was supposed to be my lesson for really rebelling against my family and not following the gang culture, i believe they made mistakes of the programming because they just cohldnt help their demonic selves and ego trips, me being a little skinny kid made me an easy target, because that just kind of broke my pride which on honesty was a painful process, but it also allowed me to open up to a more friendly nature, read how humiliation can hurt your ego to a point it shatters, as really dark and weird it sounds it was in all honesty for the best, i believe theg messed up, it turns out it was better to be pissed on than to be pissed off. Very paintful mentally, going to school and just feeling utter humiliation and pain to mu identity was hard, but at that moment on memories were slowly being revealed, which is why they also messed up, it was God showing me, and i knew sometbing wasent right at that age onwards, but i ran away from Gods voice and it was ok because he knew i would be back years later. I aslo expereinced what was also a self destruct alter again it was spiritual demons, because since i already had Gods spirit unknowingly or i just really denied God, they could only with the help of technology and demons, they could only strongly suggest dark thoughts, but now way was  i under control. I strogly feel for those celeberties in hollywood who are under control, i look and see beautiful lost people, lots of them were groomed bu their families to be what theg are, its actually somewhat not that rare for these monarch familitoto exist, i suggest you either take God with you on your walk because if you try and find the truth theybwill try n kill you, please call on Jesus, they cant kill me, but they can to you if you dont have Gods protection, your on a journey that is very brave to take, you might face lots of these gangstalking and electronic warfare. But with God you can smile and not be worried, know that if you die with God, you will be ok :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its very seemingly unreal but very real. If you read the whole story the devil seeks revenge on God for making him ugly by destroying his creation, also doesnt help man is created in the image of God so he automatically hates us. I understand people do worship him i wouldnt want people to mock them. Only real way to win someone over is respect, its a spiritual battle for souls, i choose God simply because he loves me and he is thee God. I dont think the devil stands any chance against God. God could strike him any minute, theres a plan for everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one actually worships the devil. If you have ever looked at real satanism it is about taking care yourself and treating others with respect. Again I do not believe in god or the devil. But people like you exist, need religion so it works for you. For me, if hell is real it will be fun because I do not believe that the so called devil will punish people for telling the god guy to go fuck himself. Many books were left out of the bible and many books have different versions of hell in them. The best way to get someone to follow what you say is to scare them into thinking if they do not they will &quot;burn for eternity&quot;. The afterlife is not real. I died when I was 17 and was brought back to life on the way to the ER then again while being operated on. No white light, no ring of fire. I did not even know it happened either time. It is not real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Through history there&#39;s been a constant strategy by the establishment of fooling people into believing they&#39;re someone they&#39;re not (gods, throne heirs, prophetized heroes, etc.) just to get them to do stupid shit. It works because the victim fully believes the deception. Do you think you are an exception to this? (As everyone else did)</p>

<p>Also we&#39;re aware of gov accounts that come on here to pose as monarch survivors, spread disinfo, discredit monarch as not real via people acting crazy claiming they&#39;re monarch.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really a monarch survivor, network with other survivors.  Start with <a href="http://www.pedophilesdownunder.com">Fiona Barnett</a> or whoever you trust.  Don&#39;t come here asking for belief because this website is totally compromised, corrupted &amp; crawling with disinfo spooks ... unless you are prepared to be considered disinfo.</p>

<p>In my experience, also, disinfo agents love to use typos &amp; bad grammar to blend in as authentic.  You offer no proof and nothing but another opportunity for psy-ops in another <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread.</p>
