<p>Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid. <strong>In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate&#39;s known properties.</strong> These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate&#39;s toxicity to humans. </p>

<p>The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate. <strong>The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.</strong></p>

<p>And here is an excerpt from a German study on glyphosate desiccation: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer. </p>

The pods are ripe but the vines can stay green in high moisture spots.  Wheat, Durum and Malt Barley are prob the least desiccated of all my crops but its not unheard of.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I used glyphosate. Because it was the cheapest, quickest way to get my wheat harvested at a higher grade. I had about 80% swathed but some fields had a lot of weeds coming and using glyphos late in the year helps weed control the following year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Potatoes, being tubers, the edible part is (mostly) underground, so very little Roundup would be applied to that portion.</p>

<p>BUT IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER.</p>

<p>Roundup (and all glyphosate products) act <strong>systemically</strong> - meaning that they penetrate the surface of sprayed foliage and enter the plant&#39;s vascular (circulatory) system, so the glyphosate (and all additional components, such as surfactants, wetting agents, etc) spread through ALL of the plant - from root to fruit.</p>

<p>This means that the chemical cocktail will spread even to the underground parts of plants (like potatoes). </p>

<p>Plants that have been genetically engineered to resist the toxicity of glyphosate (Roundup-Ready corn, soy, canola, etc) are of special concern, as, depending on conditions, they may be sprayed on multiple occasions through their life cycle for &quot;weed control&quot;, meaning that the chemicals will build up in their tissues, and concentrate in the whole of the plant before it is harvested - and eventually - eaten.</p>

<p>This may well be why many people seem to be more sensitive to &quot;GMO foods&quot;.</p>

<p>Either way, tasty AND nutritious Roundup is sprayed on these plants just prior to harvest, and there is no doubt that crops treated as such provide us with a healthy dose.</p>

<p>Monsanto IMPLIES that the treatment&#39;s primary use is to control perennial weeds, but the primary purpose is to &quot;ripen&quot; the field in a uniform fashion to facilitate harvesting.</p>

<p>Note in the linked guide that they specify its use on FEED BARLEY, not on barley intended for brewing beer:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ambainc.org/stream/item/6/amba-disapproves-of-post-heading-herbicide-treatments">AMBA Disapproves of Post-Heading Herbicide Treatments</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MILWAUKEE - June 11, 2012 - American Malting Barley Association, Inc. (AMBA) malting and brewing members will not knowingly buy malting barley that has been post-heading treated with herbicide, such as glyphosate, regardless of the barley&#39;s origin. The post-heading herbicide application of glyphosate to malting barley, as a pre-harvest aid to kill weeds, as a desiccant to dry down the crop, or for any other reason is not labeled for use on malting barley in the United States.  The use of such treatment on malting barley is strongly discouraged by the North American malting and brewing industry and residue testing is performed.</p>

<p>The AMBA Board of Directors, citing concerns expressed by the organization&#39;s Technical Committee for potential herbicide residues or affects on germination in malt made from treated barley, has voted to disapprove of post-heading treatment of malting barley with herbicides.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Indeed, Monsanto has developed several genetically modified varieties of food-crop plants to be &quot;immune&quot; to the effects of Roundup/glyphosate - the idea being that farmers can spray entire fields of their crops, killing all plants EXCEPT those that have been genetically modified to be immune to Roundup&#39;s deadly actions. </p>

<p>Roundup-Ready crops currently in widespread use include: Soy, corn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola">canola</a> (consumed as oil), alfalfa (animal feed, consumed by humans as sprouts), cotton (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonseed_oil">consumed as cottonseed oil</a>), and sorghum (animal feed, direct human consumption), and they are working on making Roundup-Ready wheat and other crops.</p>

<p>As these crops are unaffected by glyphosate, they may be sprayed multiple times during a growing season to kill off weeds. With your experience in the nursery industry, you know well what happens to plants that are exposed even to tiny amounts of this &quot;miracle weed killer&quot;: <strong>THEY DIE</strong>.</p>

<p>Roundup and similar glyphosate-based products act systemically: Sprayed on foliage and other aerial surfaces, they penetrate and are absorbed by the plant, and, entering the vascular system, translocate throughout the entire organism - from root to fruit. </p>

<p>When a field of Roundup-Ready crops is sprayed, the R/R corn, soy etc gets just as much Roundup as the weeds - <em>except it does not kill them</em> - rather, it remains, circulating through  the vascular system of the plant, migrating into new areas as the plants grow.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, depending on conditions, Roundup-Ready crops may receive multiple applications during a single season, with levels of glyphosate (and its accompanying chemical cocktail) accumulating in increasing levels with each application. </p>

<p>Not only is glyphosate present in the end products (beans, kernels, seeds, foliage, etc) that we either eat <em>or feed to animals that we eat</em>, studies have shown that the application of this herbicide fundamentally alter the nutrient and elemental composition of the food crops:</p>

<p><strong>Food Chemistry - Volume 153, 15 June 2014, Pages 207–215</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814613019201">Compositional differences in soybeans on the market: Glyphosate accumulates in Roundup Ready GM soybeans</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>

<p>• Glyphosate tolerant GM soybeans contain <strong>high residues of glyphosate and AMPA</strong>.</p>

<p>• Soybeans from different agricultural practices <strong>differ in nutritional quality</strong>.</p>

<p>• Organic soybeans showed a more healthy nutritional profile than other soybeans.</p>

<p>• Organic soy contained more sugars, protein and zinc, but less fibre and omega-6.</p>

<p>• This study rejects that GM soy is “substantially equivalent” to non-GM soybeans.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article describes the nutrient and elemental composition, including residues of herbicides and pesticides, of 31 soybean batches from Iowa, USA. The soy samples were grouped into three different categories: (i) genetically modified, glyphosate-tolerant soy (GM-soy); (ii) unmodified soy cultivated using a conventional “chemical” cultivation regime; and (iii) unmodified soy cultivated using an organic cultivation regime. Organic soybeans showed the healthiest nutritional profile with more sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose and maltose, significantly more total protein, zinc and less fibre than both conventional and GM-soy. Organic soybeans also contained less total saturated fat and total omega-6 fatty acids than both conventional and GM-soy. <strong>GM-soy contained high residues of glyphosate and AMPA (mean 3.3 and 5.7 mg/kg, respectively)</strong>. Conventional and organic soybean batches contained none of these agrochemicals. <strong>Using 35 different nutritional and elemental variables to characterise each soy sample, we were able to discriminate GM, conventional and organic soybeans without exception, demonstrating “substantial non-equivalence” in compositional characteristics for ‘ready-to-market’ soybeans.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My rant above focused on Roundup-Ready food crops, but as you saw with the link I provided earlier, this &quot;miracle herbicide&quot; is used on many other food crops with the specific intent of KILLING the plants so that they can be harvested more easily. </p>

<p>Aside from the food-crops listed in my previous link, there are others that are commonly treated pre-harvest, including sugar beets, potatoes, <a href="http://www.sunflowernsa.com/magazine/details.asp?ID=496">sunflowers</a>, safflower, oats, rye, and others.</p>

<p>Of course, glyphosate can also be used pre-harvest to provide a &quot;uniform kill&quot; to <strong>non-GMO</strong> varieties of soy, cotton, corn, etc., so selecting shopping for products with a &quot;GMO-FREE&quot; label does NOT necessarily mean that the crops were not treated with glyphosate, just that the plants were (supposedly) not genetically modified.</p>

<p>So, is glyphosate <strong><em>really</em></strong> bad for us to consume? Does it really cause any of the health problems that many claim that it causes? That&#39;s a good question, and if you start reading, you&#39;ll see that it is a highly volatile topic, with some claiming that it causes EVERYTHING, and others insisting that it is completely harmless. </p>

<p>Two things to consider when evaluating the arguments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the vast majority of cases where glyphosate has been studied, it has been evaluated as a SINGLE, STAND ALONE CHEMICAL (glyphosate fed to rats, mice, etc), but it is virtually NEVER used that way in practical application - rather, it is mixed with numerous other chemicals such as surfactants, wetting/spreading agents, anti-foaming agents, and other chemicals that help with even distribution, reduction of surface tension, and allow the glyphosate to better penetrate and circulate within plant tissues. There is little doubt that, like glyphosate, these chemicals remain within the treated plants, AND that they change alter the way that glyphosate interacts within human/animal organisms. For proper evaluation, the products should be tested <strong><em>as they are used</em></strong> in the real world.</p></li>
<li><p>When evaluating the arguments presented, <strong>who stands to benefit</strong>? If there is deception going on, who is motivated to deceive, and what is that motivation? Apologists for M0nsant0 and similar companies like to claim that their detractors are either pimps for the &quot;organics industry&quot;, or, more often, simply claim that they are a bunch of <strong><em>&quot;kooky conspiracy theorists&quot;</em></strong> who are taking advantage of the &quot;fear frenzy&quot; to promote their shitty &quot;blog&quot; and irritate these harmless and benevolent corporate giants.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Every time a study is released that casts the products in a negative light, apologists will claim that the studies were &quot;poorly designed&quot;, that the scientists are &quot;unqualified&quot;, or use any other excuse they can conjur to try to convince people to <strong>ignore the implications</strong>. Meanwhile, &quot;celebrity scientists&quot; will come out of the woodwork to indignantly shout down the studies, poo-poohing the findings, and proclaiming that the study was conducted by &quot;quacks&quot;. Perhaps not surprisingly, several of these &quot;celebrity scientists&quot; have been outed as recipients of substantial compensation from the corporations whose products and methods they so valiantly defend.</p>

<p>Finally, it is VERY interesting to note that the manufacturers of these and other products have been campaigning <strong>HARD</strong> to prevent Federal and State governments from introducing mandatory labeling for ANYTHING related to these products. </p>

<p>WHY?</p>

<p>Is this rant long enough yet? <em>(Yeah, I&#39;m a long-winded SOB! Sue me!)</em></p>

<p>Anyway, you make up your own mind as to whether the products are safe, and whether or not there may have been elements of corruption/collusion/conspiracy involved in the manufacture, approval, marketing and ongoing evaluation of these products - and if so, by who?</p>

<p>Bottom line and <em>always</em> the best question: <strong>Who stands to benefit?</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. There are many other issues that are arising out of the overuse of glyphosate - several strains of weeds are becoming resistant, creating SUPERWEEDS unlike anything seen before.</p>

<p>New York Times -  May 3, 2010:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/energy-environment/04weed.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">Farmers Cope With Roundup-Resistant Weeds</a></strong></p>

<p>Snippets:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first resistant species to pose a serious threat to agriculture was spotted in a Delaware soybean field in 2000. Since then, the problem has spread, with 10 resistant species in at least 22 states infesting millions of acres, predominantly soybeans, cotton and corn. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But farmers sprayed so much Roundup that weeds quickly evolved to survive it. “What we’re talking about here is Darwinian evolution in fast-forward,” Mike Owen, a weed scientist at Iowa State University, said.</p>

<p>Now, Roundup-resistant weeds like horseweed and giant ragweed are forcing farmers to go back to more expensive techniques that they had long ago abandoned. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pigweed can grow three inches a day and reach seven feet or more, choking out crops; it is so sturdy that it can damage harvesting equipment. In an attempt to kill the pest before it becomes that big, Mr. Anderson and his neighbors are plowing their fields and mixing herbicides into the soil. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much more at the link.</p>

<p>Worse still, genetically modified strains reproduce and cross-pollinate with other species in the wild, permanently changing the core genome of multiple species - often with unexpected and unpredictable outcomes on both plants and the organisms that interact with them. </p>

<p>Scientific American -  August 6, 2010</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetically-modified-crop/">Genetically Modified Crop on the Loose and Evolving in U.S. Midwest</a></strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;GM canola plant refugees from farms in North Dakota bear multiple transgenic traits&quot;</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s my main issue with ANY GMO&#39;s - plant or animal. Once this stuff gets into the wild, it can&#39;t be undone. We have changed species forever, and frankly, these blowhard scientists don&#39;t have a CLUE as to what the long term effects might be.</p>

<p>2 weeks in I can say it has reduced significantly and I haven&#39;t been 100% wheat free. Saturday I was at my grandmothers birthday and ate pasta and cake. That afternoon and the next day I felt hungover. </p>

<p>I think many of us have built up a tolerance to the poison When we stop eating wheat and then start again the difference is noticeable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RoundUp is an herbicide. It&#39;s not made to kill bugs. I&#39;m not particularly inclined to trust your opinion on this matter if you didn&#39;t know that. And the stuff that&#39;s been implicated in killing bees is the neonicotiniod class of pesticides. Glyphosate has been found to be mostly harmless to them.</p>

If there still was a investigative reporter he would discover that the information was shared with other regional salesreps, making its way to district, state, and national level within Monsanto. VP&#39;s were thrilled about the bump in sales, incentivized the reps, farmers, and support staff to PROMOTE this deadly, and insane practice, all piled on smiling at their bonus and commission checks.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a defeatist attitude that causes people to give up and just eat whatever they want due to the false belief that there is no safe food anyways. If you can figure out a bunch of easily-achievable ways to reduce your overall toxin exposure, why not do it?</p>

<p>I will explain how to reduce the toxin load in your body through food choices, water, and air. I will also help you to get some sunlight, exercise, and reduce your grocery bill by a substantial amount. </p>

<p>1) Grow your own food. You might first think of this as work, but you will learn that it is pleasurable to have the power to feed yourself at least some of the time. I have never once needed to use any pesticides. Just grow a lot of different varieties. If you have a decent backyard, you can grow several varieties of trees which fruit at different times, ensuring you a steady supply of the fruit for half the year. </p>

<p>2) Find trails in your area and learn what is edible. Hint: There is a lot of edible food in the woods and much of it is tasty. Maybe do a bit of research on any industrial plants nearby the area. If you buy food from the store, you are taking a chance and have little idea where that food came from. <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-waters/polluters/new-york">Here&#39;s one tool you could use to determine what pollutants are in your area.</a> </p>

<p>3 a) Find a local beef farmer (or chicken, whatever) and get to know them. Do they feed their cows crap food? Do the cows eat grass? How healthy do they look? Purchase a basement freezer and buy a half cow. </p>

<p>3 b) Alternative to 3a: Buy some lead-free ammunition and a rifle or shotgun (or bow if you&#39;re feeling lucky). Find a spot away from the city to hunt. Lead-free ammo is better because the lead fragments as it passes through flesh, and can easily make its way into distant parts of the animal without you realizing it.  </p>

<p>4) One very simple way to reduce indoor air pollution is to simply buy a high-end air filter. For central air/heat, buy the best filter to capture the smallest particles. Maybe go a step further and buy a portable hepa filter, running it in your bedroom while you sleep. Google &quot;air quality map&quot; and use those tools to help you determine if this is necessary. </p>

<p>5) Make sure to filter your tap water. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/44j57f/radioactive_material_has_leaked_into_the/czqlb37">Here is some information that I&#39;m sure will convince you to do this.</a> Over the course of a few months, bottled water will be substantially more expensive than your choice of home filtration. There are a few options here. I usually recommend reverse osmosis or distillation. You could also go with Zerowater, but that is a bit more expensive in the long run, unless you use rainwater or if your tap has a very low amount of contaminants. There are probably a few more brands that work just as well. Do some research <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-14/news/ct-met-lead-water-filters-20110914_1_filters-cost-osmosis-systems-brita-pitcher">(Brita doesn&#39;t remove all of the lead, for instance).</a> </p>

<p>Sprayed it pre-harvest a couple times, but those are years the weeds got away from us early in the summer. Mostly from large rains, or a bad stand of wheat that didn&#39;t shade the ground to prevent weed growth. </p>

<p>And, the biggest  statement. When roundup is sprayed a &quot;hot&quot; mix is 24 ounces per acre... But, that is mixed with 15-20 gallons of water per acre.</p>

<p>That&#39;s .009% roundup by volume.... less that one hundredth of one percent. When mixed at that ratio is has no taste, and is considered safe for oral exposure. </p>

<p>They spray it on what preharvest to kill weeds, and make the crop easier to harvest... Green wheat won&#39;t go through a combine, and elevators won&#39;t take seed with more than 18% moisture... Because it rots!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  Crops are desiccated PRE harvest.  Used mostly to accelerate maturity in crops that are maturing uneven.

<p>Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid. <strong>In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate&#39;s known properties.</strong> These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate&#39;s toxicity to humans. </p>

<p>The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate. <strong>The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>And for the people who will inevitably claim that crop dessication is not a thing, see here:</p>

<p>And here is an excerpt from a German study on glyphosate desiccation: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I am shocked that its uses include intentional application of food crops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, Monsanto has developed several genetically modified varieties of food-crop plants to be &quot;immune&quot; to the effects of Roundup/glyphosate - the idea being that farmers can spray entire fields of their crops, killing all plants EXCEPT those that have been genetically modified to be immune to Roundup&#39;s deadly actions. </p>

<p>Roundup-Ready crops currently in widespread use include: Soy, corn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola">canola</a> (consumed as oil), alfalfa (animal feed, consumed by humans as sprouts), cotton (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonseed_oil">consumed as cottonseed oil</a>), and sorghum (animal feed, direct human consumption), and they are working on making Roundup-Ready wheat and other crops.</p>

<p>As these crops are unaffected by glyphosate, they may be sprayed multiple times during a growing season to kill off weeds. With your experience in the nursery industry, you know well what happens to plants that are exposed even to tiny amounts of this &quot;miracle weed killer&quot;: <strong>THEY DIE</strong>.</p>

<p>Roundup and similar glyphosate-based products act systemically: Sprayed on foliage and other aerial surfaces, they penetrate and are absorbed by the plant, and, entering the vascular system, translocate throughout the entire organism - from root to fruit. </p>

<p>When a field of Roundup-Ready crops is sprayed, the R/R corn, soy etc gets just as much Roundup as the weeds - <em>except it does not kill them</em> - rather, it remains, circulating through  the vascular system of the plant, migrating into new areas as the plants grow.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, depending on conditions, Roundup-Ready crops may receive multiple applications during a single season, with levels of glyphosate (and its accompanying chemical cocktail) accumulating in increasing levels with each application. </p>

<p>Not only is glyphosate present in the end products (beans, kernels, seeds, foliage, etc) that we either eat <em>or feed to animals that we eat</em>, studies have shown that the application of this herbicide fundamentally alter the nutrient and elemental composition of the food crops:</p>

<p><strong>Food Chemistry - Volume 153, 15 June 2014, Pages 207–215</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814613019201">Compositional differences in soybeans on the market: Glyphosate accumulates in Roundup Ready GM soybeans</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>

<p>• Glyphosate tolerant GM soybeans contain <strong>high residues of glyphosate and AMPA</strong>.</p>

<p>• Soybeans from different agricultural practices <strong>differ in nutritional quality</strong>.</p>

<p>• Organic soybeans showed a more healthy nutritional profile than other soybeans.</p>

<p>• Organic soy contained more sugars, protein and zinc, but less fibre and omega-6.</p>

<p>• This study rejects that GM soy is “substantially equivalent” to non-GM soybeans.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article describes the nutrient and elemental composition, including residues of herbicides and pesticides, of 31 soybean batches from Iowa, USA. The soy samples were grouped into three different categories: (i) genetically modified, glyphosate-tolerant soy (GM-soy); (ii) unmodified soy cultivated using a conventional “chemical” cultivation regime; and (iii) unmodified soy cultivated using an organic cultivation regime. Organic soybeans showed the healthiest nutritional profile with more sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose and maltose, significantly more total protein, zinc and less fibre than both conventional and GM-soy. Organic soybeans also contained less total saturated fat and total omega-6 fatty acids than both conventional and GM-soy. <strong>GM-soy contained high residues of glyphosate and AMPA (mean 3.3 and 5.7 mg/kg, respectively)</strong>. Conventional and organic soybean batches contained none of these agrochemicals. <strong>Using 35 different nutritional and elemental variables to characterise each soy sample, we were able to discriminate GM, conventional and organic soybeans without exception, demonstrating “substantial non-equivalence” in compositional characteristics for ‘ready-to-market’ soybeans.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My rant above focused on Roundup-Ready food crops, but as you saw with the link I provided earlier, this &quot;miracle herbicide&quot; is used on many other food crops with the specific intent of KILLING the plants so that they can be harvested more easily. </p>

<p>Aside from the food-crops listed in my previous link, there are others that are commonly treated pre-harvest, including sugar beets, potatoes, <a href="http://www.sunflowernsa.com/magazine/details.asp?ID=496">sunflowers</a>, safflower, oats, rye, and others.</p>

<p>Of course, glyphosate can also be used pre-harvest to provide a &quot;uniform kill&quot; to <strong>non-GMO</strong> varieties of soy, cotton, corn, etc., so selecting shopping for products with a &quot;GMO-FREE&quot; label does NOT necessarily mean that the crops were not treated with glyphosate, just that the plants were (supposedly) not genetically modified.</p>

<p>So, is glyphosate <strong><em>really</em></strong> bad for us to consume? Does it really cause any of the health problems that many claim that it causes? That&#39;s a good question, and if you start reading, you&#39;ll see that it is a highly volatile topic, with some claiming that it causes EVERYTHING, and others insisting that it is completely harmless. </p>

<p>Two things to consider when evaluating the arguments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the vast majority of cases where glyphosate has been studied, it has been evaluated as a SINGLE, STAND ALONE CHEMICAL (glyphosate fed to rats, mice, etc), but it is virtually NEVER used that way in practical application - rather, it is mixed with numerous other chemicals such as surfactants, wetting/spreading agents, anti-foaming agents, and other chemicals that help with even distribution, reduction of surface tension, and allow the glyphosate to better penetrate and circulate within plant tissues. There is little doubt that, like glyphosate, these chemicals remain within the treated plants, AND that they change alter the way that glyphosate interacts within human/animal organisms. For proper evaluation, the products should be tested <strong><em>as they are used</em></strong> in the real world.</p></li>
<li><p>When evaluating the arguments presented, <strong>who stands to benefit</strong>? If there is deception going on, who is motivated to deceive, and what is that motivation? Apologists for M0nsant0 and similar companies like to claim that their detractors are either pimps for the &quot;organics industry&quot;, or, more often, simply claim that they are a bunch of <strong><em>&quot;kooky conspiracy theorists&quot;</em></strong> who are taking advantage of the &quot;fear frenzy&quot; to promote their shitty &quot;blog&quot; and irritate these harmless and benevolent corporate giants.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Every time a study is released that casts the products in a negative light, apologists will claim that the studies were &quot;poorly designed&quot;, that the scientists are &quot;unqualified&quot;, or use any other excuse they can conjur to try to convince people to <strong>ignore the implications</strong>. Meanwhile, &quot;celebrity scientists&quot; will come out of the woodwork to indignantly shout down the studies, poo-poohing the findings, and proclaiming that the study was conducted by &quot;quacks&quot;. Perhaps not surprisingly, several of these &quot;celebrity scientists&quot; have been outed as recipients of substantial compensation from the corporations whose products and methods they so valiantly defend.</p>

<p>Finally, it is VERY interesting to note that the manufacturers of these and other products have been campaigning <strong>HARD</strong> to prevent Federal and State governments from introducing mandatory labeling for ANYTHING related to these products. </p>

<p>WHY?</p>

<p>Is this rant long enough yet? <em>(Yeah, I&#39;m a long-winded SOB! Sue me!)</em></p>

<p>Anyway, you make up your own mind as to whether the products are safe, and whether or not there may have been elements of corruption/collusion/conspiracy involved in the manufacture, approval, marketing and ongoing evaluation of these products - and if so, by who?</p>

<p>Bottom line and <em>always</em> the best question: <strong>Who stands to benefit?</strong></p>
