    <div class="md"><p>The probable reason is quite simple - the coup didn&#39;t happen <em>here</em>. As a result, there&#39;s nothing to really fear if indeed it was a conspiracy. Whereas, if we find out that people in <strong>our</strong> government are terrorizing its own citizens and actively trying to enslave the population, then there&#39;s a fair amount of room for cognitive dissonance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Everything about our society runs on ignorance &amp; what you don&#39;t know doesn&#39;t hurt you. We often entertain the thought about other countries being shit and taken over by some coup or having problems because of their shady leaders, but what about the take-overs we don&#39;t see?</p>

<p>Also, I believe this coup will lay the groundwork for some type of additional military intervention. Pushing the conspiracy side on this will win some public favor or indifference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since studying neuro-linguistic programming and subsequently, the tactics used on TV and elsewhere, it&#39;s immediately clear to me now when it&#39;s infected someone. It&#39;s been a blessing as it has changed the way I approach and talk to people who are unable to grasp the big picture.</p>

<p>I mean, it doesn&#39;t help, but at least I have a better understanding of where people&#39;s views come from, and where to challenge them. Saves some face, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a book several years ago called Psycho-Cybernetics, which is more about how to re-program yourself than it is the attempts of others programming you. But it provides a great understanding of the unconscious self and how it manifests in your thoughts and behavior, which was pretty eye-opening.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671700758/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671700758/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1</a></p>

<p>As far as techniques used on television...I&#39;ve not seen a great central source to discuss that material. But learning about psycho-cybernetics allows you to immediately recognize when someone is saying something with a specific intent of embedding a thought in your mind, or to change your opinion. I consider myself fairly observant, but I think anyone who spends some time reviewing the topic will get a broader perspective on speech, and how to use their analytical part of the brain to filter out phrases that prey on your weakness.</p>

<p>Obviously, I really like this subject and wish everyone was more educated on it. They&#39;d find themselves supporting more informed opinions.</p>

<p>EDIT: A good example is to watch some crappy primetime TV show, which shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find, particularly ones with government agents. You will hear the words &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; freakishly often. What&#39;s funny is that in these shows, the theories usually turn out to be true. As they now say...truth in fiction, fiction in news.</p>

<p>So their choices are: erdogan faked it,  or the CIA just botched a coup against a NATO ally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the OP of the most popular thread on that topic.</p>

<p>I just want to say that everything that I stated was just asking questions and I never said anything was fact. I was just stating that it was extremely fishy. The mainstream media were all in full support of Erdogan the entire time this ordeal was happening, and usually that means they are trying to sway public opinion to defend Erdogan. However, they could be catching on that we are realizing what is going on, and switching it up on us, I wouldn&#39;t rule that out for sure, they&#39;re obviously very intelligent (evil, but intelligent).</p>

<p>Looking more into it, it could be either way, I&#39;m still unsure. I heard a CIA director talk about it &quot;possibly being a fake&quot; as well, so that raises red flags. Curious why Erdogan didn&#39;t just come out and say that all of this was staged against him, and that the CIA/Mossad was conspiring against him, perhaps to save his life or something, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to instantly change my mind, I do think it&#39;s still more plausible that it was a staged coup by Erdogan solely because looking at previous false flags, it is the most likely scenario, but again, they could be playing us, and I&#39;ll certainly be closely monitoring the situation, looking for more red flags like the CIA director voice clip.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind, is that they don&#39;t want to make the idea of a false flag widely known, for obvious reasons, so if they actually come out and call it a false flag, it will present issues for them, I believe they are smarter than that... or maybe they have a plan for just that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fairness it is/was pretty plausible. This guy&#39;s history is dirty to say the least. It wasn&#39;t much of a stretch. And that&#39;s what makes it almost too obvious.</p>

<p>When I see semi-mainstream news outlets and redditors start calling false flag so early though it makes me nervous. It&#39;s like the current meta sunk in but only enough to affect the perceptions of low hanging fruit. Erdogan is most likely a pawn to greater powers anyway, or a dog allowed to poop in his own yard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s true, that&#39;s the only reason i&#39;m here right now because i was reading the comments in worldnews. it definitely is fishy, but people talk about him staging it like it&#39;s fact. there was one voice of reason i saw who pointed out that the list of people probably existed before the coup, and that the real question was whether erdogan staged it or if he&#39;s just taking advantage of its failure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. You will find, with enough ingenuity, you can almost always game these tactics to your advantage, if not spin them into a form of blowback. The problem lies in exposure, perception and saturation.. All too often, narratives contrary to their propaganda (i.e. the objective truth) will be falsely portrayed as fringe or unpopular and downvoted/buried by those who have an agenda, with vote manipulation and brigading coming into play (on reddit) for example, to create a false / manufactured perception of popular opinion for any neutral observer, a form of engineered consent if you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>Any time a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; supports the narrative supportive of your government and its intelligence apparatus, you will find it parroted in your nation&#39;s media ad nauseum, to further their agenda, without failure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking exactly the same thing, OP.
I go on Australian forums called whirlpool. For the &quot;In The News&quot; section, the mods deleted posts/comments that are of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. They haven&#39;t touched any comments insinuating a most likely false flag for this Turkey coup.
Maybe MSM are reporting this as a possible false flag because the events are so implausible, that even the least ignorant are calling out the BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly people need to understand what corpora you theory means. If more than one person conspires to commit a crime it is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>This was absolutely a conspiracy. A group of people conspired to over throw a government. </p>

<p>The question isn&#39;t was this a conspiracy or not, the question is who truly conspired???</p>

<p>Another case of uniformed people trying to make critical thinkers look like nut jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if this is a criticism or not. But it&#39;s enough to make me clarify the point I&#39;m trying to make.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a ton of headlines on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> about the possibility of a conspiracy related to the recent coup attempt. So people are willing to believe in this kind of thing.</p>

<p>But the second you try and suggest that someone in your own country (e.g. gov&#39;t, ultra wealthy, corporations, etc.) might be up to something similar? All of a sudden, everyone is like &quot;Oh no, that kind of stuff doesn&#39;t happen around here!&quot;</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m pointing out is that there&#39;s a sense of denial. It&#39;s like a blind spot. People can still see what&#39;s going on and they&#39;re happy to put out some pretty good theories...</p>

<p>But only <em>when they feel like they&#39;re allowed to do so</em>.</p>
