    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re looking for, if you haven&#39;t already found it, is Revolutionary Volume I and II. Many, many great tracks. I&#39;ll warn you, some are a bit more &quot;real&quot; than others (i.e., Dance with the Devil). </p>

<p>I personally love listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bURgTLHryrg">Poverty of Philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gGLI9ifEzw">Homeland and Hiphop</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrS_w7YRCIE">Cause of Death</a> has one of my favorite verses (Verse 3) and least favorite (Verse 1).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Verse (3): </p>

<p>And just so Conservatives don&#39;t take it to heart</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Bush did it, &#39;cuz he isn&#39;t that smart</p>

<p>He&#39;s just a stupid puppet taking orders on his cell phone</p>

<p>From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone</p>

<p>The military industry got it poppin&#39; and lockin&#39;</p>

<p>Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine</p>

<p>And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back</p>

<p>Without 9/11, you couldn&#39;t have a war in Iraq</p>

<p>Or a Defense budget of world conquest proportions</p>

<p>Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortions</p>

<p>Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked</p>

<p>But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted</p>

<p>And Dick Cheney, you fuckin leech, tell them your plans</p>

<p>About building your pipelines through Afghanistan</p>

<p>And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan</p>

<p>You might have some house niggaz fooled, but I understand</p>

<p>Colonialism is sponsored by corporations</p>

<p>That&#39;s why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations</p>

<p>Tell me the truth, I don&#39;t scare into paralysis</p>

<p>I know the CIA saw Bin Laden on dialysis</p>

<p>In &#39;98 when he was Top Ten for the FBI</p>

<p>Government ties is really why the Government lies</p>

<p>Read it yourself instead of asking the Government why</p>

<p>&#39;Cuz then the Cause of Death will cause the propaganda to die..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude check out &quot;Rich Man&#39;s World&quot; it&#39;s a gagnsta rap song from the point of the 1%... here&#39;s the lyrics:</p>

<p>Arthur Jensen: &quot;You get up and howl about america and democracy. There is
No america there is no democracy, We no longer live in a world of nations
And ideologies. The world is a college of corporations... Inexorably
Determined by the... Immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business.</p>

<p>And I have chosen you to preach this evangel&quot;</p>

<p>Immortal Technqiue:
For all my free market, healthcare robbing, stock stealing, retirement fund
Fucker with niggas. Fuck your little credit card scammin, jewlery stealing,
Crack selling, liquor store robbing mother fuckers (Its a rich mans world)
Hahahaha. <strong>Shout to the homies, Carnegie, og, Willie Randolf Hearst,</strong>
<strong>Rockefeller, the real Rockefeller, my main bitch Leona, little Louie the</strong>
<strong>Thirteenth, Jack Abramoff,</strong> hold ya head, my red child niggers, let&#39;s
Get this money</p>

<p>[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I spend my day repping america overseas
Pensions for the workers? Nigga please
Embezzlement etiquette private settlement
I&#39;m better with confederate rhetoric from my mansion in connecticut
Foreclose and evict homes at the tenement
I twist words like a speech inpediment
I hope you got good credit bitch
If not better get a new job with benefits
When I play golf with niggasii get cheddar with
New money buys brand new karats
My old money bought your great grand parents
<strong>You got grills in ya mouth I ain&#39;t mad at ya</strong>
<strong>I own every gold mine in South Africa</strong>
Thanks baby you made me a billion
Plus I own a building for each one of my children&#39;s children
That&#39;s the shit, snort coke in the wet mist usa sucking my dick
Yea what fuck the law &#39;cus real jail is for suckas
I go to country club prison you dumb mother fuckers
(I am the 1% fucking bitch)</p>

<p>[Hook:]
You know my ceo corporate steeez please
Overthrow governments overseas in a breeze
Politicians in my pocket for a few hundred Gs
So if I&#39;m never in court my assets a never freeze</p>

<p>[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
I got a job and house and a bank account
When I&#39;m out I doubt that&#39;s something you could say
And if not then I fake death like Kenneth Lay
Make money every day the world burns
Wanna tax us while y&#39;all struggle to pay taxes
I&#39;m getting my money the fastest
Memos and faxes shredded up documents
Slush funds through the corrupt continents
But they don&#39;t want me indicted
&#39;Cause they don&#39;t want my dirty laundry aired when I fight it
Don&#39;t get my lawyers excited
&#39;Cause what good is a law if you can&#39;t rewrite it
I got cia traders, dictators so <strong>fuck y&#39;all whistleblowers and haters</strong>
(Its a rich mans world) Shiiieeeaaat
<strong>I&#39;ll invest money from Al Qaeda</strong>
<strong>In the bank 911 widows go to later</strong>
Capitalism so I pray to fuck the state of the world
Money talks so what the fuck I need to say to ya girl
(I donit pay em to fuck, I pay em to live)</p>

<p>[Hook:]
You know my ceo corporate steeez greed
I&#39;ll treat countries like the imf down on your knees
Real gangsters run the world fuck what you believe
I&#39;ll cut down the forest while y&#39;all niggas burning some trees
I&#39;ll get your family murdered for a couple of Gs
&#39;Cause your working class money ain&#39;t fucking with me
You think rappers are rich &#39;cause of songs you heard?
My labels make the money and haven&#39;t rapped a fucking word</p>

<p>[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Y&#39;all in the ocean coastin&#39; with the sails out
Hey America thanks for the bailouts
I made off at the banco ambrosiano
Got away scott free like el Vaticano
Acitvists activist get mad at me
&#39;Cause I&#39;m a tax free charity
80% to the staff and company
And 20% to the homeless and hungry
The country gotta pay the fed reserve
Kick back to the banksters haven&#39;t you learned
You protest cops or patrols on the street
<strong>But I bought city hall so I own the police</strong>
<strong>Email facebook and the shit you tweet</strong>
<strong>On the phone companies so I heard you speak</strong>
My suggestion is no correction no elections, s** with no affection
No invention would benefit the world of man
Will exist till I got the money in my hand
World bank, interest rate damn rape on the spot
But I&#39;m a gangster you gon&#39; take my money like it or not, nigga
(I got your country in my pocket, motherfucker!)</p>

<p>[Hook:]
You know my ceo masonic steeez cheese
Only little people pay all these taxes and fees
Since you were born we control what you watch and you read
And pretty soon were gonna own the fucking air that you breathe
I take what I want fucker I don&#39;t have to say please
I&#39;ll convince you that it&#39;s good for you, take it and leave
You think presidents are the face of a nation
I put em all where they are, end of the conversation</p>

<p>In 2014: 48.1 million Americans lived in food insecure households, including 32.8 million adults and 15.3 million children. 14 percent of households (17.4 million households) were food insecure. 6 percent of households (6.9 million households) experienced very low food security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a bigger problem if people don&#39;t think the US is in poverty. There ARE people who are struggling to put food on the table. You sir, don&#39;t know the have of it with your privileged life. </p>

<p>1 in 6 people in America face hunger.</p>

<p>The USDA defines &quot;food insecurity&quot; as the lack of access, at times, to enough food for all household members. In 2011, households with children reported a significantly higher food insecurity rate than households without children: 20.6% vs. 12.2%.</p>

<p>Food insecurity exists in every county in America. In 2013, 17.5 million households were food insecure. More and more people are relying on food banks and pantries. Collect food outside your local supermarket for a local food bank. Sign up for Supermarket Stakeout GL.</p>

<p>49 million Americans struggle to put food on the table.</p>

<p>In the US, hunger isn’t caused by a lack of food, but rather the continued prevalence of poverty.</p>

Most &#39;poor&#39; people are not poor by Third-World standards. Yes, many kids do go to bed hungry, because their parent(s) are drunk or high as shit.
