        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When you think about this, it&#39;s fucking impossible. So let&#39;s look at the &quot;facts&quot; here:</p>

<p>The man was driving a truck</p>

<p>He obviously had an assault rifle</p>

<p>The truck was accelerating in a straight path at 25 mph</p>

<p>He had grenades</p>

<p>So he obviously had an assault rifle which requires two arms to utilize. He was driving a truck at a slug speed of 25 mph. He was a lone wolf. So he must have been driving his truck and shooting out the window right? One hand on the steering wheel, the other hand riding shotgun? They say he shot first, so what else could he have possibly done? &quot;Surprise motherfucker&quot; and opened up the truck to shoot everyone, then ran to the steering wheel to start plowing people? Maybe he went on the sidewalk and shot everyone, then ran inside the truck to plow people? Are there anymore possible scenarios because I just don&#39;t see how this is possible.</p>

<p>Assuming he did the one hand on the steering wheel and one hand riding shotgun stunt that I&#39;m theorizing, it&#39;s still impossible. You can not shoot an assault rifle while riding a truck. Your aim would be off so much that you&#39;d just be shooting the air. You wouldn&#39;t hit anyone. The speed of the car moving along with only one hand on the large rifle means you can&#39;t hit anyone. You would literally just be spraying. As far as driving goes, I guess he would be able to keep a straight path with his foot on the gas. But with him shooting his assault rifle at the same time, wouldn&#39;t the recoil/kickback be so strong that he would start steering the wheel out of control? With shooting, he most likely had 30 cartridges in the clip. He would have to either come to a complete halt, take both hands off the steering wheel, or whatever to reload. With the amount inaccuracy I described the shooter to have, I don&#39;t see how he could event hit more than 3 people, but anyway, he would need a SHITLOAD of magazines to pull it off. The media wants us to believe this was a lone wolf attack in which one crazy idiot steered a truck AND rode shotgun into an open crowd of thousands. How is this even possible? I think I listed every single scenario and why each one is impossible. There&#39;s just no way one person could do this no matter how you look at it. If it is possible than he must truly have the luck of the devil to have such high success in an extremely uncoordinated, brainless attack.</p>

<p>Now on to my next point, the speed of the truck. 25 mph is a slug speed. I can run around 26 mph. Any person there could have outran that truck. It&#39;s just unreal. There&#39;s no way that truck could leave a trail of dead bodies extending to over a mile going at 25 mph. Even if it was going at 75 mph, it&#39;s still impossible for the trail of corpses to be that long (besides the fact that it doesn&#39;t look like the people were hit that hard). People would see the impending danger ahead and move... </p>

<p>And lastly, the grenades. If you were a terrorist, what sense does it make to use guns in an environment where there&#39;s a huge crowd of people close together when you could throw grenades at them? Grenades would be 1,000,000 times easier and 1,000,000 times more effective for a terrorist to use than to shoot a heavy assault rifle at people with extremely low accuracy and a limited magazine. Even if the terrorist didn&#39;t do this, it would make much more sense to just throw grenades out the window into crowds so you could decimate hundreds of people. That&#39;s the only thing that could justify going at that slow speed, so your grenades hit everyone.</p>

<p>In every way I look at it, the feats that this man pulled off are entirely impossible alone. The decisions he made to terrorize people were simple minded and could have easily been taken down, but they most certainly wouldn&#39;t have killed many people. This event was a false flag, please try to prove me wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is so dumb on so many levels, especially the running part</p>

<p>bruh you can&#39;t run 26 miles per hour when usain bolt sustained 27 for only a couple seconds, and that was after driving until he hit the 60 meter mark.</p>

<p>What the hell would you do when you&#39;re in a panicked crowd and a truck is coming at 25mph? I don&#39;t think you understand how fast that is. Do you not believe that people could&#39;ve gotten hit by that truck?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to even respond to whatever dumb reply you have, this is just ridiculous. </p>

<p>edit: Had to throw this edit in to reiterate my point...your statements on running were so ridiculous that it&#39;s 100% certain you&#39;re just pulling stuff out of your ass. You REALLY think most people can reach 25mph? God damn I actually feel bad for you.</p>

<p>edit 2: <a href="http://www.totalsportek.com/list/fastest-footballers/">these</a> are the speeds of the fastest soccer players. 26mph is faster than any of them.</p>

<p>You are not faster than professional soccer players. You honestly just thought &quot;only 25mph?....well gee, I think I can do better than that!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo IDIOT. That was only one point I made about the details of the event which seem to be highly falsified. Regardless of how fast the average person can run, at only 25 mph, people could EASILY get out of the way of that truck. Secondly, there&#39;s no way he&#39;s gonna mow down a fucking mile of people considering that people would start moving as soon as 100 feet so please. The point is that 25 mph is extremely slow, not that people can run at that speed.</p>

<p>You paid no attention to the rest of my points, just picked a part the most reaching one. Why don&#39;t you counter anything else I actually stated in this post, because I covered a lot inconsistencies. Regardless of how fast people can run, that truck was going way too slow to knock down people past 100 feet, let alone kill them. If anyone is dumb, I&#39;d say it&#39;s you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People get killed by trucks going 25 mph all the time, it happened twice in new york city this summer. that&#39;s not even a situation where it&#39;s a truck plowing into a crowd of people. A semi-truck going 25mph has tons of momentum. You ever hear the noise a garbage truck makes when it&#39;s going 25 and hits a pot hole? It sounds like a bomb going off</p>

<p>Most people can run around 25 mph, it doesn&#39;t take an Olympic contestant to reach those speeds. Most people can run at the same speed of that hypothetical truck.</p>

<p>I will say that many of these events over the past month deal with jaw droppingly insane lone gunman tactics. They are just not possible for 1 individual to do all that stuff (in all of these events). </p>

<p>&quot;According to the National Council on Strength and Fitness, the average human can run at the speed of 15 miles per hour for short periods of time. This speed varies greatly depending on factors such as age, weight, culture, wind and even height of the individual.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, Usain Bolt ran at 27mph, so I doubt most average people come close to the 25mph you stated. </p>

<p>If it was an AR-15 style rifle then I would think you would be able to shoot it one handed while also keeping one hand on the wheel and your foot on the gas. AR-15s barely kicks. I&#39;m sure his accuracy wouldn&#39;t be fantastic while doing this, but how good of accuracy do you really need when you&#39;re shooting into a large crowd of people. </p>

<p>Video - Man shoots AR-15 off of his nose with 1 hand to demonstrate lack of recoil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t see how it would be difficult to drive a truck into a group of people while half assed shooting an AR out of the window and killing scores of them in the process. I think it would be harder to get out of the way then you think when there is a large number of people in a fairly small area all in a panic running and tripping over each other.  I think this event was much more likely to be carried out by one person than the Pulse shooting or the Dallas shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From most accounts of what have happened that I&#39;ve read he didn&#39;t even begin shooting until he came to a stop. So you&#39;re driving while shooting and trying to maintain control is a total non factor that you  probably fabricated to push what ever narrative you want to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s like 1 out of 5 scenarios I made up. I never said it happened. CNN said he was shooting before he started driving. You clearly do not get the point of a conspiracy theory. This is all entirely theoretical but with my spin of what makes the most sense. You have only picked apart 1 of 5 scenarios I made up. </p>

<p>The actual story could be something else.</p>

<p>Say he was in a ring of what he thought were terrorists, perhaps even getting paid by ISIS a lot of money, then his partners disappear (they were gov&#39;t &quot;informants&quot;) and he sees all the weapons are fake, figures out he&#39;s about to get framed and the whole thing was a setup, flees from the situation panicking and runs people over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing the cocksure need-to-believers refuse to realize is that this isn&#39;t GTAV. If you hit a crowd of people going 25mph you&#39;re not going to be going 25 mph for long. Certainly not long enough to mow down 70 people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how long these idiots are gonna pick apart that point I made about running at 25 mph. This just shows how stupid the subreddit is. I literally made about 3 other points and that was my smallest one, so I guess they&#39;re too stupid to debunk anything else or challenge another point. Maybe your slow asses can&#39;t run that fast, but regardless, you can easily move out of the way of a truck moving at 25 mph. I&#39;ve moved out the way of cars going 3x faster than this, obviously with a distance gap between us, but obviously not one too large considering the fact that I had to run. You guys keep talking about that same shit when the fact of the matter is that people can get out the way of a truck moving at 25 mph. Done deal. I made many other points in this thread, that was the smallest one. Maybe I was wrong about people running at speeds close to 25 mph considering that everyone is a fatass from the burbs whose never seen action in their life, but even at just 20 mph, which is easily possible with an adrenaline rush, people can easily move out of the way. Like you are saying, the truck would eventually slow down.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know but this subreddit is really fucking stupid. They picked a part one thing I said that&#39;s not completely true, but still possible, while not focusing on the main point; 25 mph is too fucking slow to mow down a damn mile of people. It&#39;s like they read the whole thing which was too complex for their simple minded brains then saw the part about &quot;people running 25 mph&quot; and went like &quot;OH, YOU RETARD!&quot;. If you guys were smart, you would challenge something else I said. I was not wrong at all, that was merely one sentence that was not completely true. The main point is that 25 mph is an acceleration entirely too slow to hit people down OVER A MILE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first reaction to the vid we saw was &#39;wtf is this?&#39;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the conspirators are getting lazier with these false flags  or if I&#39;m just that desensitized to everything.</p>

<p>What I do know is that this subreddit is infested with shills and you shouldn&#39;t let them shape your opinion of the subreddit as a whole. They&#39;re usually the people shooting down any kind of question or comment that points the finger at who we all know should have a finger pointed at them. They protect the interests of their sponsor.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re dealing with these people just say &#39;nope&#39;. That&#39;s the only reply they should ever get. Anything more just feeds their shill fire.</p>

<p>They picked you apart because you gave them the opportunity to.</p>
