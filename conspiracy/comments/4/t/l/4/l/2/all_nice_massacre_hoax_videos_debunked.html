<p>I still don&#39;t see any organs, guts, contorted limbs, dismembered bodies, and pulverized corpses. The only one that looked credible is the first one which I must admit had me thinking for close to an hour, but I&#39;ve concluded that it most be doctored. The other ones aren&#39;t convincing at all. How come all I see is a tiny piece of red flesh coming out of that person? There should be a thread of intestines connecting her torsos to his legs, yet I don&#39;t see it. How did his shoe go from the position it&#39;s at in 0:15 to where it&#39;s at in 0:08? Are those supposed to be her shoes? There&#39;s no way that person&#39;s shoes went that far. Is that bloody mess one person or two? After looking at it for an hour, I&#39;ve determined that it&#39;s one person. There&#39;s no way her body got mangled THAT bad that she got cut in half. It looks like her whole entire bottom got cut but her other leg is connected to her torso? This isn&#39;t possible. You would have to use a sword to cut her and then put her body in that arrangement. I refuse to believe a truck could have fucked her up that bad. Besides that, I don&#39;t see any guts or exposed internal organs. All I see is tiny chunks of flesh. That person would be pulverized and have tire marks on her, but she doesn&#39;t. She would even look dirty, and at least have more blood on her, but she does not. This is all moulage done on dummies. The point of all of the videos being in 240p with this being no exception is that there&#39;s no way too see how fake the people are. Go to liveleak and you&#39;ll see people cut in half that are still alive/moving, at least as far as their nervous system. When people get cut in half their nervous system is still on and they&#39;re still moving, regardless of them being dead. In plenty of cases there are people cut in half and dismembered who are still alive and can still talk. Considering the fact that people can do these actions under these circumstances, yet none of the other people who look half as fucked up as that bitch can, tells me that these are all dummies or wax figures. I also think it&#39;s relatively protocol to yellow tape the whole crime scene and prevent anyone from getting on the road and especially not play with people that are dead. So to answer your question no, that&#39;s not gory enough for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATbn96P5i-E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATbn96P5i-E</a></p>

<p>There were 1000s of people but they don&#39;t exist, that&#39;s why there&#39;s no footage. The 3 videos that they showed us are all questionable; each and everyone of them in itself is questionable. The one with the oscillating tripod is obviously fake because it turned as soon as the truck came. The one where the guy starts recording the truck out of no where as it&#39;s bluffing speed is fake, because, why the fuck is he recording that truck? The police presence there makes it even less credible... police would be shooting at the tires rather than shooting at the passenger seat, just in case they missed and shot the driver so he would die with his foot on the pedal and actually go at real speeds of 70+ MPH. Still, the chances of him catching the action right as it takes place are pretty low, it must have been take 3. Roads were blocked for that whole entire day, so you&#39;re telling me he mounted that truck in front of where people are at and then starting going on a rampage? He didn&#39;t get caught before coming anywhere close to those people? Security was on high alert for that day? Gimme a break. The other video, with the person in the middle of the crowd, is also fake. Yet another bad angle. That&#39;s all there is to it. It&#39;s all fake.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATbn96P5i-E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATbn96P5i-E</a></p>

<p>This is the same stupid ass video that people keep posting saying it&#39;s real when in reality, it&#39;s no different from the rest of the videos. It&#39;s low quality, you don&#39;t see anyone get hit, and the fucking camera man points the camera on the ground so you can&#39;t see anyone get hit. The people in that video are all disappearing in thin air: <a href="http://imgur.com/P4bqO4d">http://imgur.com/P4bqO4d</a> That dumbfuck had his feet disappear from what can be made out of that footage with simple video editor analysis. Apparently it really DID disappear because you would hear the sound of his bones cracking and there would be blood splatter everywhere if that truck hit him. It wouldn&#39;t sound like the grill/front of the truck hit him since the tire clearly hit him. Also, the truck has no engine? It sounds like they just swapped a fucking sample of a subway train into a pedestrian setting. I don&#39;t hear any engine on the fucking truck. This video has been debunked hundreds of times already.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgkiifxRSvo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgkiifxRSvo</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ll say that yes, these are mannequins. Their bodies are supposed to be pulverized with much more blood as well as with openings, orange and yellow flesh, and exposed intestines. Their limbs are supposed to be contorted or broken off. These &quot;people&quot; do not look nearly grotesque enough to have been ran over by a speeding truck. There is a reason why none of their bodies are opened with internal organs all over the street. Mannequins do not have organs. Look up pictures of people ran over by trucks, or people who have impacted heavy, speeding force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an incredibly ignorant argument. Zero logic. &quot;Sit back&quot; while the shadow government plays problem/reaction/solution. Who cares if the world becomes more of a police state after these hoaxes right? They are just hoaxes... followed by political grand standing and harder core legislation. Who cares if the laws are put into place based on false flags and hoaxes? What difference does it make if a terrorist act is real or not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My entire statement was sarcasm. It was clearly sarcasm. Only a simple minded fool would think random violence needs to be simulated. It takes great effort to pull off a covert false flag operation. Fake blood costs real money. Real blood is free. It takes nothing for some weak willed lunatic in any corner of the world to lose his shit and run amok taking as many people to the afterlife with him as he can. People will kill for any ideology you can think of and it doesn&#39;t need to be the shadow government calling the shots. Humans kill other humans all day everyday on this planet. Hoaxes are for UFO enthusiasts. </p>

<p>no it isnt.   victims get compensation either way.  drills are portrayed regularly with hyper real simulations, including amputee actors.   it serves to inoculate first responders against trauma.   so they report them as real. .. not a big leap.</p>

<p>No, not everyone, just you. How about this, go ahead and read through all of your recent posts but pretend they are written by someone else. What do you think has that madman so incensed? What kind of person believes that he is so right that everyone else must be a moron, stupid, retarded, or has down syndrome? Why is it that this raving lunatic believes that his own theories are proof of themselves? How can someone&#39;s only argument when someone disagrees with their harebrained theories be that they are dealing with a shill or a troll? Why does someone who asks so many questions refuse to consider anyone&#39;s responses to his many rambling questions? Hmmm... my guess is that he&#39;s either mentally ill or just an asshole. I&#39;ll let you decide, go ahead and read what I&#39;ve been reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this, and it&#39;s a problem that we don&#39;t see a single &quot;person&quot; who looks like this. What&#39;s even more of a problem is that no one here can explain why we don&#39;t. The people who think this is real are so ridiculous. I haven&#39;t seen anyone debunk a single problem that I and other truthers on reddit and YouTube have pointed out. Some of you are truly pathetic. This isn&#39;t like 9/11 when you had a horde of government agents trying or successfully debunking every conspiracy theory made by truthers. This time around you idiots have nothing to say to disprove the problems that we have pointed out, so I am done talking about this, it&#39;s truly pathetic how no one is trying to prove this is real. At this point I&#39;m beating a dead horse. You guys know that this fantasy where 300 people were hit by a truck going at 25 mph over a mile is bullshit, that&#39;s why your efforts to debunk and disprove truthers are unbelievably horrible. </p>

I would wager that many of the dead and injured were not crushed by the truck itself, but by the panicked crowd. It has happened many times before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.... this is the bullshit you say when I debunk you. What&#39;s funny is that you&#39;re actually ******** (censorship for the sake of not being deleted) but still trying to collect enough brain cells to muster a response that can explain why the dummies do not look badly injured. You actually tried to debunk us with what little brain power you have and failed miserably. I have debunked you, I said the dummies are spaced out, and you are ignoring this point. Thank  you.</p>
