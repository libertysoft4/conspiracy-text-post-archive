    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>they absolutely ARE straying off the NATO line.  Erdogan is getting way too close with Russia.  Check the lng pipeline maps.  Turkey is going to be balkanized (along with syria, iraq, lebanon, and Iran) to create a kurdish state in the middle of the middle east.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna quote myself from 2015 on this one, because this whole thing shouldn&#39;t have come as a surprise to anyone in this sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>erdogan is trying to save face. he used to be a US puppet and then he started trying to negotiate gas pipelines.</p>

<p>Russia was forced to end the South Stream project through Ukraine with the US coup there. Turkey negotatiated the terms to a turkish stream pipeline with gazprom, which would ultimately bring gas to western europe. Obviously, this is in the face of the US who wants their pipeline from Qatar to feed without Russian competition.</p>

<p>For almost a year, you can see the anti erdogan propaganda building. The US wants him out.</p>

<p>Most likely funding of ISIS and the downing of the russian plane(s) are by Ergenekon, a turkish deepstate operation with ties to the gulenists and a certain US intelligence agency. Erdogan had the choice to either take credit or admit that Ergenekon is running the military, and face a coup.</p>

<p>whose plan?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Erdrogan stage this ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>who&#39;s saying he did?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who wants a Kurdish state there ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kurds and Israel/ Neocons/ Neoliberals</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can you Balkanize Muslims ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Balkanization refers to breaking up states, not people.  But ONE was to break up muslims would be to fund an extreme group (say, wahabi/ salafists) and have a group of sunni mercenaries declare war on the shiite led nations/ armies (say Iran, Lebanon hezbollah).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What have 16.000 teachers have to do with anything ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Erdogan is accusing them of being gulenists.  Gulen has always attempted to overthrow Turkey through the education system.  There are 120 gulen schools in the US alone.</p>

<p>As much as I firmly believe there is a lot of widespread monitoring and corruption in the US political system, and as much as I can accept that the US intelligence network may be far more vast than the average citizen realizes, there is ZERO chance that that many &quot;teachers&quot; in Turkey play a vital enough role in setting Turkish policy and politics that they would be of any use for intelligence purposes.</p>

<p>Not going to happen. Without direct oversight we have problems with actual trained intelligence personal keeping their mouths shut, the possibility of finding 16,000 random teachers to do it for you is pretty fucking slim.</p>

<p>EDIT - And, the Turkish government would have to have uncovered at least 16,000 of them. Which naturally presumes that there are MANY more than the 16,000 which were caught and removed...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our military forces are much much better armed, no doubt, but in a guerrilla war, especially a civil war, any advantage in armament decreases over time until costs ultimately outweigh benefits. In whichever case, fighting a subversive civilian population (instead of uniformed soldiers) is much more difficult, i.e., as long as that population is still useful to you as a productive human resource / tax base...aaaand you actually give a damn about human rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why do you still believe that a civilian insurrection would stand no chance against a better-equipped U.S. military? Sure, the odds of initial success are long (see Turkey), but time is longest and Homo Sapiens are still more creative than Bots (disclaimer: gap quickly closing) and there are plenty of <strong>non-violent</strong> methods of sabotage and subterfuge that will work much more efficiently against even a highly modernized army than resorting to violence. I would tell you a few for appetizers but you could be AI, so go figure them out for yourself, but tell no one else either, not even your programmer. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, I don&#39;t think Media supports this theory. Also, I don&#39;t consume mainstream media. I came to this conclusion on my own, through analysis of the facts and extrapolation from the events that happened. I don&#39;t know if the US staged it or not, I am hesitant to believe that, but it was certainly staged by someone. Erdogan definitely knew it would happen, and knew it would fail. He was ready for it to fail and to purge thousands of people who had nothing to do with the coup from his gov&#39;t. </p>

<p>Yeah, I relate to this big time. What to you think about the idea that we&#39;re being directed into a conspiratorial worldview on purpose?

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt it was a CIA attempted coup, because that would mean the CIA was totally incompetent, which is false. Let&#39;s be real here, the CIA has completed more successful coups than anyone else in the entire history of the world, they definitely know how to do it correctly. The CIA will not pussyfoot around when they have Erdogan&#39;s plane landing at the airport right in front of them. The CIA will not launch a coup without knowing exactly what is going on with Erdogan. You think some dumbass on the internet knows how to handle a coup the right way, but the CIA doesn&#39;t? Get real dude. What you&#39;re saying doesn&#39;t even make any sense.</p>

Why would you blame the world&#39;s superpower right away if it isn&#39;t true, he could have achieved the same by faking an internal coup and avoiding having some big enemies. The Fact is saying that the CIA would have never failed and calling that evidence tells me you require none of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[2001] Indonesia last year published only 22 scholarly papers in mathematics. In Vietnam, which only emerged from war in 1975, there were about 1,300. Of course the killings of 1965 alone can&#39;t explain this, but the New Order military had such an obsession to control everything that it managed to snuff out all initiative. A massive purge such as 1965-66 had never happened before. The New Order crushed not only the PKI but an entire nationalist generation, all those who came up in the 1940s and &#39;50s. Many of them were not even involved in the PKI. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080720091321/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit68/hilmar2.htm">Inside Indonesia</a> </p>

<p>Erdogan wants to drive Turkey back into the middle ages. I hope the people rise up. But they&#39;ll have to suffer a lot before they do. But, as Iraq taught us, firing enormous numbers of government employees, motivates them to violence. After all, they have nothing left to lose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called a purge. That&#39;s what happens after a coup fails. It could be worse. In Stalin&#39;s day, purgees didn&#39;t get fired, they got taken out behind the shed. </p>

<p>Still, dismissing this many civil servants is bound to have repercussions; unless, that is, Turkey locks it down and becomes more authoritarian.</p>

<p>Behold fascism reborn, just branded differently. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how long Erdogan can keep it up. Parodoxically, fascist states are inherently unstable. It all depends on how long the West wants to keep funding this circus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it fascist to oust foreign spies? That&#39;s at least how I understand this purge. He&#39;s cleaning house, getting rid of any CIA-connected folks that encouraged the coup. I understand the mainstream media is saying that he&#39;s getting rid of the good guys, but does that make any sense? Of course the mainstream media makes it look like he is some sort of villain. In reality, I think he is getting rid of the people who are connected to the CIA who are causing shit in his country. To me, this makes sense. Why shouldn&#39;t he do that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your idea, but do you really think we need thousands and thousands of CIA plants in every level of the country&#39;s infrastructure just to accomplish what we&#39;re trying to accomplish in Turkey? I mean shit. Don&#39;t you think if we had that many guys there, the coup would have been successful? Hell, if we had that many police officers and teachers and members of the court system, we wouldn&#39;t even need to stage a coup, we could just transform the whole damn society from the inside. So I don&#39;t think that idea makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not CIA, it&#39;s secularists. </p>

<p>Turkey has always existed as a state in tension - a secular state defending an Islamic society. The US has its system of checks and balances - in Turkey, the founding father was Ataturk - an officer in the military. He considered the military to be the ultimate protector of the civil, secular state. By design, the army was supposed to step in by now, and send the mullahs back to their mosques. Then the army would retire back to their barracks. </p>

<p>Erdogan has short-circuited this entire process. Whether the coup was a fraud or not, he&#39;s using it as a justification to remove the central tension that the Turkish republic was built upon. He&#39;s presiding over the greatest victory of the Islamists since the Ayatollah took Iran. </p>

<p>What makes the CIA look particularly dumb, they considered Erdogan a coherent partner. Erdogan&#39;s big win should have been a Gulf NG pipeline through post-Assad Syria and Turkey, to liberate the EU from Putin&#39;s energy monopoly. Erdogan should have been a player, but he&#39;s overstepped his game. </p>
