<p>The nightclub was broken into a few nights ago, and they explicitly state there is no CCTV footage for the break-in, but where is the footage of the shooting?

<p>I do searching and find articles like, &quot;Sickening CCTV from inside&quot; which only leads to a snapchat someone made. Following the link for CCTV it only brings you to a collective page of info.
<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/sickening-cctv-inside-orlando-nightclub-8223948">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/sickening-cctv-inside-orlando-nightclub-8223948</a></p>

<p>Watching &quot;How the Pulse nightclub shooting unfolded&quot; why did they feel the need to let off &quot;explosives&quot; in the rear of the building, when the assailant was supposedly armed with explosives? Have you ever seen search and rescue missions before? These people are masters of their craft, they know how to operate hostage situations that involve forced entry.

<p>Orange County Florida Live Audio Feeds, feed is missing for 6-12-16 from 00:00 hours to 02:57. Look for yourself. They say it was a &quot;technical error&quot;, but these seem like too many circumstances to be true.
<a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/archives/feed/8688/?rl=rr">http://www.broadcastify.com/archives/feed/8688/?rl=rr</a></p>

<p>There were 50 wounded, and 50 killed in this event, and no coverage except for short blips that don&#39;t tell any kind of story. These things aren&#39;t adding up. God I&#39;m pulling out my hair here. Have we been lied to? I am having doubts in our government for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>And the American people at large aren&#39;t clamoring for the footage, so you&#39;ll never see it. Americans are almost totally operating on autopilot now; <em>they don&#39;t want to know the truth</em>, just keep the lights on and the internet going.

    <div class="md"><p>Heres what I believe: If anyone died, it was Omar Mateen. But I&#39;m not even convinced someone was killed. The survivors they paraded on TV werent injured and weren&#39;t in the nightclub for the attack. The Pulse was probably closed that night - its website didn&#39;t have any events listed.  Why did the event last so long? Maybe Omar realized he was being set up and there was a confrontation. Maybe nothing happened at all, and this is just the beat they can do to serve up a scary story. </p>

<p>The witness / victim accounts are too similar, like they&#39;re following a script. Too many people claimed to be piled in a tiny bathroom where Omar shot random people, except for blacks. Then weird stories about escaping out the patio, and how couldnt more people escape out the many exits instead of the bathrooms? </p>

<p>Not a single victim they paraded on TV had any gunshot injuries. No one genuinely distraught or crying real tears either. Angel Colon was supposedly shot in the hand, but he didn&#39;t even have a bandage on his hand! Victims doing TV interviews from the car and home within days of being shot up? With full mobility? Everyone interviewed with any relation to the attack was acting--one friend of a victim is clearly caught acting as he bickers with his handler (this part of the interview is so bad, it&#39;s edited out of CNN&#39;s online video). And you know why they all can&#39;t stop smiling? Because they&#39;re getting a big payday. You can see the dollar signs in their eyes. </p>

<p>Then you analyze the official story and timeline of events. It makes zero sense! Cops were on the scene within minutes, got in a gunfight, then let Omar retreat into the bathroom where he shot off people and waited hours until explosives were used to breach the bathroom?</p>

<p>Man I&#39;m completely with you on this. It&#39;s outright depressing that we&#39;re being so blatantly lied to. Then you piece together some of the other recent hoaxes/false flags, you really start to question where this world is headed. </p>

<p>I can actually understand his demeanor. Sometimes, surviving a really close call actually does put you in a good mood afterwards. Some people focus on how incredibly lucky they are to have survived something that could have killed them. Also, he&#39;s a young guy, he&#39;s alive and now he&#39;s getting interviewed on TV.</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably be in a pretty good mood too if that was me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it wasn&#39;t on camera, did it happen? Or did it happen differently than the official story and then video was disappeared?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another fun excursion for young conspiracy theorists: surveillance video of the shooting of Alton Sterling was stolen by police without a warrant after detaining the shop owner for four hours in a police car. They made the poor man pee on the side of his building rather than let him into his own shop. He&#39;s suing. Interestingly, their body cameras stopped working during the event. And they arrested the man who did film the shooting at his place of work for traffic tickets in another state BUT they said he looked like someone who had committed a crime that would have gotten him sacked. His boss was cool and laughed it up. But obviously there&#39;s a conspiracy to hide evidence here and retaliation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/07/baton-rouge-police-took-alton-sterling-surveillance-video-without-a-warrant-or-permission.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/07/baton-rouge-police-took-alton-sterling-surveillance-video-without-a-warrant-or-permission.html</a></p>

<p>So this is JUST one police department. </p>

<p>Now imagine how large and powerful the federal government is. Think about how transparent our government is (haha) and how rife corruption is. Soooo, my only question is &quot;how many of these shooting events are faked,&quot; not &quot;could one be faked.&quot; I&#39;m not a jaded asshole, ok, I am, but really, look at how the media is pushing the gun control agenda. Look at how reacting to &quot;terrorism&quot; justifies everything questionable and unsavory our government wants to do. Recall that false flag events are well established in our history and that the police, military and private security outfits have a history of firing on US civilians to protect the assets of the wealthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I wasn&#39;t there so I can only speak for the videos I&#39;ve seen, and I admit most people do look really shocked/horrified. There&#39;s the occasional weird reaction (smiling cop video), but my point is in super traumatic situations (Sandy Hook, Orlando, etc...) more horror doesn&#39;t necessarily translate into more emotional outpouring. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a common reaction to be dissociated during a traumatic event (e.g. the girlfriend of philando Castile) or even to exhibit paradoxical emotions. Another important thing to consider is that they&#39;re not interviewing the people immediately after the event, that complicates things quite a bit as far as predicting their demeanor. I would personally expect an interviewee hours or minutes after experiencing the trauma is to have a flat emotionless tone when recounting the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get if a small percentage of a group are not acting in line with how we expect.  But when almost everyone that has gone through a tragedy is <em>acting</em> strange?     </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the way I see it.  When I look at how people act after something that definitely could not have been staged (like a Tsunami) they act one way, but in some of these questionable events they seem to be acting a completely different way.  It&#39;s weird.  Is it proof?  No, but people should at least admit its at a bare minimum odd.   </p>

<p>Same deal with evidence.  After some events that couldn&#39;t have been faked we have all kinds of video evidence.  After questionable events you are simply told the evidence exists, but you never actually <em>see</em> it.  Again, odd.</p>

 That said, it is kinda strange that there is no cell phone footage. Makes me wonder if the fops were erasing it when they were removing the bodies and evidense afterwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this problem in general. Seems to me there is only one ultimate solution. We basically have to end privacy. I know that sucks, but for the average person that&#39;s more an annoyance than anything else; for the government however it&#39;s a very big deal. Imagine if every word every government official uttered was required to be made public in real-time.</p>

<p>In cases like the pulse shooting, someone needs to invent a cheap 360 camera that records 24-7 and distributes its content to other such cameras and the Internet in real-time, so there&#39;s always a backup. </p>

<p>Secrets are the handmaidens of evil, and governments have far too many. Of course, the end of privacy will also require a change of mindset among the general populace. We&#39;ll have to learn to be more forgiving. Everyone is prone to error. And if everyone&#39;s errors are on display, there won&#39;t be much of a society left if we condemn everyone harshly for every poor action.</p>

<p>Most those injuries are consistent with blunt force trauma (which is what a truck is considered) with flesh wounds by the metal.

I&#39;ve also seen people be killed presumably instantly (I was a paramedic so didn&#39;t get the autopsy) at low speeds because their neck or head snapped causing serious brain bleeds, despite having no intestines hanging out.</p>

<p>But you can save your breath. I&#39;ll be done responding at this point. Clearly impossible to have a conversation with someone who has zero clue what they are talking about, and feel the need to rant and rave about serial killers (completely irrelevant to this topic) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if there is some island they take these people to live out the rest of their lives on?  You figure once they were paid off the government wouldn&#39;t want them mingling in with the rest of society.  There has to be some sorta witness protection type program they all go into afterwards.  My best guess?  Dead men tell no tales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of shitty bars and what not don&#39;t run CCTV.   Or they have it but it&#39;s off, or there&#39;s no tape in, or something else stupid.  People who run bars are not world class thinkers, it might surprise you to know.</p>

<p>source : I drink a lot</p>

<p>The assertion that they are fake comes with it the burden of proof.  It&#39;s not on me to prove they are real.  Logic and probability dictate that they can&#39;t all be fake - but this is exactly what conspiracy theorist claim, often with the weakest of &quot;evidence&quot;.  Something simple like missing CCTV footage is <em>not</em> enough evidence to prove anything.</p>
