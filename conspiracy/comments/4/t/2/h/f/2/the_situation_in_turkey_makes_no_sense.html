</ol>

<p>There was also the obvious bias that all news sources had when reporting this, they were all pro-government and anti-military. Even Clinton chimed in and said she was very pro- Turkey government, and we ALL know what she is.</p>

<p>I looked through all the threads, saw many many Turkish people post that this coup was a good thing, yet when you look at the news, it&#39;s ALL pro Turkish government, and the live feed ONLY posts things that are pro Turkish government. </p>

<p>This has to be one of the sloppiest false flags I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s terrible what is about to happen to the Turkish civilians, the iron grip is about to get a lot tighter. </p>

<p>I know <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been overrun, but I&#39;ve taken a break from the conspiracy scene altogether, this is just way too juicy to pass up, and maybe before this topic becomes &quot;overrun&quot;, we can have a nice discussion. I am just simply in shock at how sloppy this one is, usually the false flags are, in general, pretty well thought out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you watch the broadcast when they took CNN? It was an empty studio with THOUSANDS of pro-government supports heard on the audio cheering for the president, along with propaganda messages. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they get on CNN and send a message? Why wouldn&#39;t they at the BARE MINIMUM destroy the equipment or cut the feed?  Nope...let&#39;s just broadcast pro-government messages....</p>

<p>Apparently the soldiers are saying that they were told it was a training exercise. This makes a lot of sense, considering the initial videos of the tanks show the crews driving through the streets without a care in the world until they actually get attacked.</p>

<p>The military not firing on the protestors also makes sense. They didn&#39;t use ANY FORCE to stop the pro-government people from approaching and just told them to get back...then when they realized &quot;Fuck...the police are here. This probably isn&#39;t a training exercise...we&#39;ve been set up&quot; they gave up their guns and jumped into police custody as fast as they possibly could.</p>

<p>All the opposition leaders were arrested alive, because they were all arrested before this ever began...</p>

<p>The very few bodies on the streets are all within 2 feet of a brick wall...almost as if they were anti-government guys who were lined up and shot to look like victims.</p>

<p>This is a real conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so this not all to bright airforce couldn&#39;t intercept erdogan&#39;s plane, since on military radar all planes look the same. no transponder. cmiiw.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is extremely unlikely, probably impossible. Yes on primary radar all aircraft look the same, but most modern radars, especially military ones, incorporate secondary radar to overlay identification data over the primary radar contact. The primary radar serves as a back up and to track aircraft without a transponder. Otherwise the military would have a difficult time tracking which aircraft are hostile and which are friendly. And Erdogan&#39;s plane must have had the transponder running, otherwise they might have been shot down as a unidentified flight or they would not have showed up on flightradar24&#39;s ADS-B coverage if all electronics were down. Of course, anyone could have used other systems to track the plane, including the non-radar based ADS-B tracking system. </p>

<p><strong>This is the crucial question.</strong><br/>
Either the &quot;coupists&quot; were clueless or they were duped.<br/>
What  I find hard to believe is that the pilots flying his plane did not turn its transponders off if they believed he was in danger.
His plane was circling for hours roughly between Bandirma and Balikesir, and would&#39;ve been a sitting duck for any military plane.<br/>
This fact, and the fact that Erdogan immediatelly sacked 2700 judges pushes me to belief that coupists were duped and that this was in fact Erdogan&#39;s ploy to remove remaining opponents on his way to establish a full control that he was not able to achieve through parliament.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why would they not take the president hostage or kill him outright?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They should have captured him, not kill him, because that wouldn&#39;t win them a lot of supporters. But it is very strange why they held a coup when Erdogan wasn&#39;t in the country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did police forces &quot;capture&quot; a large part of the ARMY that is attempting a coup?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t capture a large part of the army, the army withdrew because of all the civilians surrounding them and their cause seemed pointless. At least that&#39;s what I thought at the end of the coup. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did it seem like the gunfire in the videos was aimed at nothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too scare the people away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would an army attempting a coup, that has access to tanks/helis/jets just up and lose? I&#39;ve been following the live feed since the beginning, they seemed to be totally dominant, with shows of force in the air, gunfire, etc... And now the president shows up, and it&#39;s over?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They only held parts of the two most important cities, it was not the entire army. There is no point in fighting for a cause when most of the citizens don&#39;t support you and rather defend the president they chose during elections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is the president now giving a speech, after an &quot;attempted coup&quot; with the military still in control of weapons, and a lot of the country still wanting his head?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A soldier for the most part learns to follow up orders, at the end of the day, the generals decide what the army is going to do. And the masterminds behind the coup were killed when their helicopter was shot down. That is what I could gather from the livefeeds.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I believe all this was very suspicious and Erdogan has strengthened his position with this coup, but your points are easy to counter.</p>

Hence taking over key assets like TV stations and government buildings which aren&#39;t tactical combat points but establish the rebels as the group in power.   </p>

<p>In this case it seems the argument of the military rebels was that they were restoring democracy and order. Staring off by executing the still-popular president would absolutely destroy that narrative. Not to mention any new government would have to assimilate quickly into the international community (eg NATO) and curry favor with Turkey&#39;s allies. The international community would absolutely condemn such a violent uprising.   </p>

<p>Better to arrest the President and try him for whatever crimes they can muster or force him into exile if possible. I&#39;m sure something like that was attempted (maybe assassination was too) but clearly it failed. I expect we&#39;ll get more details in the coming days.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Establishing chaos is the last thing a coup would want and something that would benefit the government, and this situation generally applies to any Coup d&#39;état. People support a coup as long as it seems they can cause direct political change without too much bloodshed. If there is too much chaos people will want to return to having the government in charge, because they&#39;d rather live under a dissatisfied government than an anarchy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree. Just to play devil&#39;s advocate here and to propose a theory as to why this didn&#39;t work but what if it was because the military was trying to not get on the bad side of the common man and decided to not run them over and whatnot? What if it&#39;s because Erdogan called the people to take to the streets?</p>

<p>Hearing about the &quot;training exercise&quot; thing makes sense. Most of the military just got confused, then when the police showed up they laid down their arms and PRACTICALLY JUMPED into police custody. One tank crew panicked and tried to GTFO...that civilian guy was probably under the belief that the tanks weren&#39;t going to touch them, but was incorrect.... </p>

<li><p>The police force <strong>are</strong> Erdogan&#39;s military. The state military recruits via conscription, therefore a lot of military personnel haven&#39;t joined out of any sense of civic duty, national pride, or love for the government; they&#39;re there because they have to be. There&#39;s a lot of hate for the current government in the military, and everyone knows it. Erdogan has feared a military coup since he came into power, and has been outfitting the police with the weaponry and training to deal with that inevitability.</p></li>
<li><p>Soldiers often deliberately miss their targets when the enemy is not someone they hate or want to kill. This was a massive problem in Vietnam, where young men with near-perfect accuracy on the shooting range would miss constantly in action, since they felt no real resentment toward the Vietnamese people. The Turkish military don&#39;t hate cops or civillians. They weren&#39;t going out there to mow down innocent people.</p></li>
<li><p>It wasn&#39;t the entire army. It wasn&#39;t the entire air force or tank battalion. Also, what were they going to do with those tanks and jets? Without capturing Erdogan, and/or other important government officials, the planes and tanks are useless. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re just going to start shooting and bombing things indiscriminately, just because they have the weaponry to do so. That wouldn&#39;t achieve anything other than increasing support for Erdogan. Why didn&#39;t someone in a jet just kill Erdogan during his speech or when he was in his private plane? Chaos was not the goal. Killing Erdogan would not have increased support for the military coup, it would have riled up Erdogan supporters and led to a <strong>very</strong> bloody transition; possibly a small civil war. The goal was not to kill Erdogan, it was to capture him, hold him accountable for his crimes, and replace him with secular, fair, theoretically not corrupt leadership.</p></li>
<li><p>Because it makes him look like the clear victor. He wasn&#39;t taking a particularly risky risk. He was in a location with a building behind him, and aides and guards all around him, protecting him. He was also surrounded by a huge crowd of pro-Erdogan supporters. Nobody in that crowd would even get a chance to pull a gun before he/she was torn apart by the mob.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This coup d&#39;etat was a total botch job, but I don&#39;t, personally, believe that it was a false flag by Erdogan himself. This has been a long time coming. Unfortunately, Erdogan has been diligent in rooting out dissidence in the military and government. The dissidents haven&#39;t had the resources, time, freedom, government insiders, or secrecy to prepare adequately, and so the coup, as far as we can tell, will most has failed. </p>

<p>Is killing the current leader something that usually happens in a coup? What precedents are there for something?

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not, and i&#39;m glad it&#39;s not something they attempted. </p>

<p>I was kind of frustrated at the coup&#39;s loss when I typed this, so I wasn&#39;t really thinking 100% logically. I was more like &#39;&#39;you&#39;re going to lose unless you blow him out of the sky! Just do it!&#39;&#39; But, you&#39;re right, chaos was not the goal. Arresting Erdogan, holding him accountable for his crimes, and restoring the country to a secular, democratic nation under new leadership was the goal. </p>

<p>Killing Erdogan would have done nothing except created a massive amount of hatred (more than there already was) for the military among the religious, right wing, and/or indoctrinated. When restoring the country to a peaceful secular state was the goal, killing Erdogan would have been one of the worst moves they could make, and may have sparked an all out civil war, or, at least, a <strong>very</strong> bloody transition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the few times where I can honestly say I believe there is major fuckery afoot. I have posted my feelings in another thread but I will share them here as well.</p>

<p>If you add everything we know from what&#39;s been reported, none of this makes any sense. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The lack of urgency from the military, they didn&#39;t even execute basic coup tactics i.e., arrest the president and his closest officials.</p></li>
<li><p>Erdogan &#39;heroically&#39; flies back in to Istanbul to make a speech when the situation is still out of control? </p></li>
<li><p>We have info from the 1,300+ soldiers being arrested,  many of them are claiming they were told this was a military exercise.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I believe Erdogan has played his country as well as a large part of the world and in doing so gained an enormous amount of support and power.</p>

<p>Also, let&#39;s not forget Erdogan was busted in 2014 attempting to stage a false flag to invade Syria.</p>

<p>Edit: Another thing I&#39;d like to add, at no point did the military ever come out and say they were staging a coup and &#39;have control of the country&#39;, like the news agencies have been reporting. Most of Turkey&#39;s top military officials are missing at this moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to say that this attempted coup had some covert, alternate motive behind it on the basis that it has accomplished NOTHING. I don&#39;t have anything to say, I don&#39;t have a theory, I don&#39;t know enough. However, this coup was taken down way too easily, way too fast, and way too conveniently. Seriously, what have they accomplished? How and who is taking them down? Civilians? Give me a fucking break. If they were serious, they could have easily ran all of those people over and then make them disperse. We did not see the confrontation between the police and military, so how did they get stopped? I&#39;m supposed to believe that they did so much planning and coordination so that they weren&#39;t unmasked but as soon as they execute the coup, they get taken down in a couple of hours? Really? How could they have miscalculated so horrendously bad? They did not take affirmative action.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this, what a joke. Rising suspicion.</p>

<p>we arent getting much of anything reliable on what is actually happening their.</p>

<p>turkey has a long history of cutting the internet during things like this so its going to take some time for anything reliable to really spread.</p>

<p>as far as i can tell given what i have seen, its a pretty sizeable chunk of the military attempting to fufill their constitutional role of being the last line of defense responsible for maintaining the government of turkey as secular.</p>

<p>erdogan wants a muslim state run with islamic law, obviously he is running afoul of that constitution and this appears to be the military trying to put an end to Erdogans dream of reviving the ottoman empire, and his backroom support of ISIS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you look at all millitary coups from the beginning, such as the ones in Libya, Yugoslavia or Venezuela (oops, sorry. Wrong country), they are almost always started by student protests (Can be throwing molotov cocktails or peaceful protests that quickly disgenerate). Heavy millitary are basically absent at this point. </p>

<p>Also from my knowledge this coup only lasted for a few hours and stopped after the president appeared (Followed what seems to be a Reichstag Burning clone). </p>

<p>Usually the president appearing in a coup is a flag to ask himself to be killed, Yanukovych secretly left in the middle of a coup while Ghaddafi was found and killed by mercenaries. So yes, if there is a real coup the &quot;coup targets&quot; won&#39;t show themselves face up, lest be making a speech.</p>

<p>So yes, unlike most coups against third-world governments, this is clearly staged to consolidate power.</p>

- Coming back as a hero,&#39;&#39;stopping&#39;&#39; the rebellion
- Getting rid of inobedient, higher ranking officers without being suspicious (i mean what the hell, over a thousand got arrested along with them)
- Having a high chance of reinstating death penalty
- Throwing a bad light on one of the last forces devoted to good old Atatürk.
But that&#39;s just my guess. I would love any contribution or correction, as I can&#39;t be sure about any given info at the moment.</p>

They closed their embassy the 13th, two days before it, they even banned the french celebration on 14th. On 15th it happenned. They knew and the diplomacy was very slow to react to the coup compared to other nations. The french were waiting for a success and they would make a comment afterwards, they didn&#39;t want to condemn the coup. The US comment weren&#39;t condemning the coup either, only went it failed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so glad some people are seeing this and realizing something might be up.</p>

<p>When I spoke to one of my Turkish friends, the first thing she said to me was that something smelled fishy about it. It just very well may be a false flag to allow Erdogan sweeping control of the country and allow him to squash his substantial opposition. Although when news first broke, I also had also thought that it may have been a self-fabricated coup to replace Erdogan with some other puppet ruler.</p>

<p>Frankly, it&#39;s scary that these sorts of theatrics are being used in the current day - but I guess they&#39;ve always been used haven&#39;t they? Perhaps we the people are finally figuring it out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turkey had recently made a $50billion deal with the EU to house Syrian refugees who were going to Greece and then on to Germany. They got paid for every &#39;refugee&#39; they stopped crossing into Greece/Europe</p>

<p>BUT as this Syrian mass exodus to Germany is the plan of George Soros it had to be stopped, which he tried to do with his financial influence but that didn&#39;t work so another form of intervention was required ...</p>

<p>Why? Becoz 81yo Soros, who has long held a grudge against Germany want&#39;s revenge for the shit he went through growing up Jewish in occupied Hungary, IIRC his father was badly treated, so Soros has little love for Germany, and now as a very rich (Old, time is running out and money isn&#39;t everything!)) man he has the power to buy situations that manipulate economies.</p>

<p>He knows that sending 2+million Syrians and assorted ME people will totally disrupt the German system and I bet he&#39;s rubbing his hands in glee at the chaos he&#39;s slowly creating, and what&#39;s worse is he&#39;s not alone, there are a number of rich old powerful men like himself with crazy personal agendas</p>

<p>Very simply, war is extremely profitable for a select few. Bankers like Soros are one.  And these people have absolutely Zero interest in stopping conflicts that are the source of their profits. </p>

<p>The tentacles of the Military Industrial Complex spread far and touch a huge percentage of corporate America. The amount of businesses that are directly or indirectly beneficiaries of the money spent on &quot;defence&quot; is frightening, becoz their &#39;ideal customers&#39; are people who are at war ... </p>

<p>And now as the &#39;enemy&#39; is some nebulous thing called a &#39;terrorist&#39; and the &quot;wars&quot; are basically &#39;civil wars&#39; between factions <em>within</em> a country (e.g. Syria, Afghanistan) it&#39;s really nothing to do with any other country, especially the US, which is why we won&#39;t see any US or UN intervention in these places until the &#39;fire is so bad it can&#39;t be put out&#39;, <em>then</em> you&#39;ll hear the chest thumping rhetoric of &quot;something must be done&quot;!</p>

<p>But, if you subscribe to the idea that groups like Al qaeda and ISIS are constructs of the CIA et al then none of this shit is very surprising. IIRC the US has been <em>directly</em> involved in over 40 &#39;regime changes&#39; since the 1970&#39;s!</p>

<p>C.I.A. aka Capitalism&#39;s Invisible Army and Soros&#39; &quot;mates&quot; are it&#39;s commanders!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why would they not take the president hostage or kill him outright?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was on holiday at the time apparently, so he wouldn&#39;t have been in Ankara or Istanbul. That&#39;s probably why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did police forces &quot;capture&quot; a large part of the ARMY that is attempting a coup?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some police will be armed as well, surely?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did it seem like the gunfire in the videos was aimed at nothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at combat footage from Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine or pretty much anywhere. You often can&#39;t see the enemy they&#39;re firing at, even though they are firing towards enemy combatants. The gunfire in the videos from Turkey will have been at something, you just can&#39;t see what. Especially as the videos I saw were at night and the gunfire was in the distance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would an army attempting a coup, that has access to tanks/helis/jets just up and lose? I&#39;ve been following the live feed since the beginning, they seemed to be totally dominant, with shows of force in the air, gunfire, etc... And now the president shows up, and it&#39;s over?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some in the army opposed the coup as well, and they also have access to many tanks and aircraft. It wasn&#39;t a coup by the entire army. So &quot;the president shows up and it&#39;s over&quot; is not what happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is the president now giving a speech, after an &quot;attempted coup&quot; with the military still in control of weapons, and a lot of the country still wanting his head?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it really surprising for a politician to make a speech during a crisis?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figure there&#39;s two possibilities for this:</p>

<p>1) Erdogan&#39;s purges weakened his opposition in the military enough for them to try a last ditch effort to take the country while he was away on vacation. This would explain the limited resources, lack of support in the upper ranks, etc...</p>

<p>2) Equally plausible is a false flag by Erdogan meant to consolidate power. He uses this as an excuse to execute anyone in opposition to him and shut down political rivals as now he can claim they&#39;re &quot;traitors&quot;.</p>

<li><p>that is a good question, usually you would want to take out leaders before anything else.</p></li>
<li><p>The military units could of not been that confidant about the plan.  This gets into number 1 as well.  There was a report I read about an attempted attack on  Erdoğan.  If true then this could of played out just like the attempt coup in Nazi Germany that tried to take out Hitler.  Basically without taking out Erdoğan the plan had no chance.  </p></li>
<li><p>Warning shots?  I mean the last thing you would want to do in a coup would be to start killing mass amount of civilians, you would need them on your side.  Or I could see it as a way to strike fear into the minds of the people they where  going after. </p></li>
<li><p>It is hard to say if all those thing were actually maned by the people trying to pull off the coup.  There were jets that shot down helicopters occupied by the coup units. </p></li>

<p>By the way, being so &quot;sure&quot; that the &quot;script&quot; is exactly how you say it is makes you sound like Alex Jones, nobody is going to believe someone who acts like that, the best way to get people to start asking questions is to provoke them to well... start asking questions, rather than giving them the answers.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re trying to help, but I&#39;ve seen a million and one posts like yours where you&#39;re so sure that you&#39;ve figured it all out, and a million of those have been wrong. </p>

<p>I have been since 2006-ish.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived through so many end of the worlds, times when I was supposed to be thrown into a fema camp, times when martial law was supposed to be inacted, times when I was supposed to get nuked, 2012, etc... I ignored them, refusing to be paranoid, it&#39;s all to keep you living in fear, they have NO intention of removing us, why would they remove such a great system where they take the spoils?

<p>The difference between the amount of people asking questions in 2006 and now is absolutely massive, if you have been in the scene for as long as I have (only 10 years), then you know this.</p>

<p>Cognitive dissociation will make people refuse to live with the admission that the same people who they pay taxes to and get news from are part of the same gang that forced people to jump-off windows or vaporized first responders at the WTC towers in 2001 and is now crucifying christians and carrying out mass beheadings now in Raqqa, Syria and Sirte, Libya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;ve said before, as scarce as truth is, the supply has always been in excess of the demand.</p>

<p>As you would expect from the Laws of End Times Reductionism, the process representing how the masses are confronted with the HORRIBLE TRUTH about their last days in Illuminatziland, involves only five entities and resumes to only three steps.</p>

<p><strong>The Five Entities involved in the Process</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Matt Marriott, the last End Times Prophet;</p></li>
<li><p>Kyoon, the first and so far only one to echo the TRUTH;</p></li>
<li><p>Google, the path allowing to access the TRUTH;</p></li>
<li><p>the illuminati media;</p></li>
<li><p>the audience, i.e. the sheeple who formally accepted the Mark of the Beast and now simply wait to be slaughtered.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Three Steps involved in the Process</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>TRUTH is revealed (WHAT happened and what is going to happen; WHY it happened or will happen) by the last End Times Prophet and echoed by Kyoon. The Laws of End Times Reductionism are found at the basic layer of the TRUTH.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone who thanks to Google has been confronted with the Truth will refuse to accept it.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the predicted TRUTH begins to unfold, there are three possible cases:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a) Illuminati media pretends that it is actually not happening;</p>

<p>b) Illuminati media uses the &quot;<em>back into the future</em>&quot; technique to announce it will happen at same point;</p>

<p>c) Illuminati media uses the &quot;<em>shock and awe</em>&quot; technique to officially announce it.</p>

<p>Erdogan - Ok, ok we submit, we&#39;ll do what you want</p>

<p>USA - Good, fly back to the capital, you&#39;ll be safe</p>

<p>USA then calls the miltary officers</p>

<p>USA - Yea so about that coup, we&#39;ve decided not to get involved, the situation has changed, you&#39;re on your own...&lt;click&gt;</p>
