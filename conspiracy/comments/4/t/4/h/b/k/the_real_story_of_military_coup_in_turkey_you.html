        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Erdogan and Turkish intelligence knew all from the beginning that there was a group against Erdogan and wanted to utilize this. They didn&#39;t act until the very last second, so that with many people being killed Erdogan would get what he wanted, ie</p>

<ul>
<li>fully controlling the justice (just now thousands of rulers and prosecutors dismissed)</li>
<li>dissolving the whole secular army (even innocent secular ones)</li>
<li>bringing back Gulen from the US and prosecute him (I don&#39;t care for that tbh)</li>
<li>being the head of the state increasing his votes</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I can assure you that Turkey is totally f****d. Erdogan, would capitalize on this failed coup for everything he can do. Just read the news and see what kind of reforms would be implemented in Turkey. Imams are repeatedly calling people to streets for the sake of Allah saying weird, unusual Arabic prayers (from midnight to now). People, who are thinking all this happening is partly staged would be accused of being a Gulenist and traitor by Erdogan and his supporters. </p>

<p>Erdogan might have been elected by democracy, but there is no such thing as real democracy with people chanting Allah&#39;u Akbar all day long or cutting soldiers&#39; necks (that happened at Bosphorus Bridge) even when they surrender. RIP Turkey for turning into a Middle East country soon.</p>

<p>I just wanted you to know the real story of the ongoing events. Feel free to share this with others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to read whether Obama is a legit Muslim or just helping them for his own ends. We damn sure know he isn&#39;t really a Christian though at this point. We also know the Clintons have taken tons of bribes from the Saudi&#39;s to their Foundation. It&#39;s possible Obama has too but was just smarter, and made it harder to track the money. IMO that Middle East Muslim Oil money is being used to try to buy the world, and Globalist Western leaders are willing to sell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s just look at it simply. The coup failed so embarrassingly bad that it had to be a false flag/set-up/staged. The military miscalculated by a huge margin and had no motive to do anything. No one was trying to overtake the government. Those soldiers were just as confused as the media and news agencies claimed to be. They had no idea what was going on. I&#39;ve never heard of a military operation being thwarted by harmless civilians, and I won&#39;t listen to it now. I&#39;m just going to say this has to be fake based on the fact that it was only 6 hours.</p>

<p>Now as for any ulterior motive being behind the coup, that&#39;s obviously the case. Erdogan is an autocrat who will use this opportunity to gain more power with the support of NATO and the world based on the fact that supposed &quot;democracy&quot; prevailed. But looking at what&#39;s presented to us, it&#39;s a false flag.</p>

I tried to find a fair chunk on Turkey, but its spread out over various chapters. Their importance on the world stage in a couple more decades is repeated throughout this book, as is Mexico&#39;s.</p>

I&#39;m sure it predicted the refugee crisis too.  I&#39;ll read over some chapters again and see what he&#39;s saying.</p>
