    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a bull in a china shop and from what we can see around the world, white doesn&#39;t seem to be what&#39;s in right now. Go ask the people in The Middle East or Africa how they are feeling about white folks, or the Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, Russians, Koreans or perhaps the Native Americans? How about the African Americans? Even the Germans have looked away at what is mostly the southern American ideology or what I like to call &quot;Backwoods Zionism&quot; where the white folks hate Zionist but push the same ideals as they do!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why do you think the North and the South fought? </p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think Russia helped the north?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think the Zionist hate Obama?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think Donald Trump was the main one riding him about winning?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Don&#39;t kid yourself, Trump is a mad man and he&#39;s gonna try and hold the world hostage to stay exactly where it&#39;s at. The people on the other side didn&#39;t want war, it was the Zionist that pushed for the war in order to continue control the world that they have put so much pain and sorrow in. This is why Obama is so humble, trying everything to change the world to a equality and free one. Yet the Zionist still move against the plan that is supposed to be our freedom and awakening.</p>

<p>Yes, a American Civil War is coming, it&#39;s in all of our media and they know it and push it. It was bound to happen when the idea of oppressor met the idea of oppressed. That thought alone separates those who are aware and those who are asleep. Is it because of the 2016 election? No, it is because of the world history, this is not the fault of this generations but the sins of our fathers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when I see the works of people like Obama, Elizabeth Warren and the people that back them, I see that there has to be a reason why the Zionist and Trump don&#39;t like the new gang**</p>

<p>I believe Trump was quoted, <strong>&quot;They are taking the country apart piece by piece&quot;.</strong> That&#39;s a big statement by Donald Trump because the only things that have changed are integration and pushing more social systems for the people, less incarceration, higher minimum wages, etc. </p>

<p>What exactly is this new gang of global liberals destroying is the question, this has to be acknowledged. What exactly is Donald Trump protecting that didn&#39;t exist prior to 2008? All I remember is the towers coming down and someone, don&#39;t wanna name any names was the first on the scene to cover the trail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know, that a centralized nation can be changed from within with just the right people pushing the idea? After a nation begins to eat itself (much like Greece and Rome), the opportunity presents itself that either the nation is to destroy itself or arise from a different position.</p>

<p>I can image search a lot but that won&#39;t make a difference because in truth, we don&#39;t know and probably won&#39;t ever know exactly where Obama came from or who Obama is. What I can pinpoint is that his ideas are anti the way the American government used to be ran, so that tells me something.</p>

<p>There are theories, some say he is the messiah, some say he&#39;s the son of Frank Marshall Davis a famous poet who ran the Black Associated Press, some say he&#39;s the antichrist, some say he&#39;s the devil himself but again, what I must watch for are actions and for the last four years, I&#39;ve seen him work against the conspiracy narrative that was presenting itself prior to his election. Everything that they said would happen didn&#39;t and every time I went to go find out why it didn&#39;t happen, there stood Obama opposing the move.</p>

<p>So you gotta bring more to the table than another conspiracy narrative, throw some facts that can&#39;t be refuted. What I&#39;ve come to realization is that our own government is at war with itself (just like in Hunger Games), and that is starting to ripple more and more everyday. </p>

<p>So if I&#39;m choosing sides, yes I would choose the side of someone who has gone out of their way to make sure the GOP and the Zionist had the hardest time doing whatever they were trying to do.</p>

<p>Revelations 3:7-9</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</p>

<p>8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p>

<p>9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>

<p>It says the black man were given guardianship of the water. Chief of the elements. I don&#39;t really think he&#39;s black though. I think he&#39;s patri-lineally Islamic. Probably doesn&#39;t know it and practices Satanism like the rest of the elite. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe a man who has authorized more drone strikes and funded ISIS, then cries great big crocodile tears over Sandy Hoax. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a fraud. Check out redefininggod.com</p>

<p>I think Sunni Muslims are technically Kabbalistic Jews, and Obama is technically Islamic, through his father&#39;s line, then in some respect he does say that he&#39;s Jewish. There&#39;s plenty of speeches of him denigrating Christianity and promoting Islam and demonstrating great respect towards it. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not a Muslim, he&#39;s never claimed he was, he&#39;s not Jew<strong>ish</strong> what he does admit is that he is Christian. It goes much deeper than that I believe, he seems to reference the Hebrews A lot. Even the church that Dylan Roof shot up practiced black Hebrew ideology.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Obama doesn&#39;t fund ISIS, he has funded rebels in the area of Syria only to keep people from joining ISIS which seems to be working. The drone strikes you refer to are the mess of prior presidents, wars in which Obama himself inherited. He&#39;s also blocked the Zionist from being able to join Syria and vetoed any attempt of them doing so while he has been president.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He has to first claim a religion openly, which he doesn&#39;t but references to the Black Hebrew ideology stand out like a sore thumb. What I will point out is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service at Trinity:</p>

<p>“People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend’s voice up into the rafters….And in that single note – hope! – I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, <strong>I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion’s den, Ezekiel’s field of dry bones. Those stories – of survival, and freedom, and hope – became our story, my story; the blood that had spilled was our blood, the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world.</strong> Our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black; in chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didn’t need to feel shame about…memories that all people might study and cherish – and with which we could start to rebuild.”</p>

<p>That is what Obama refers to above. The Black Liberation Theology of Obama’s sect under Jeremiah Wright explicitly states that blacks are the “Chosen People” and that whites and America will face retribution for slavery. The following quote is from Black Theology and Black Power” by James H. Cone (1969), page 151, his first book on Black Liberation Theology.</p>

<p>Therefore, God’s Word of recon­ciliation means that we can only be justified by becoming black. Reconciliation makes us all black. Through this radical change, we become identified totally with the suffering of the black masses. <strong>It is this fact that makes all white churches anti-Christian in their essence. To be Christian is to be one of those whom God has chosen. God has chosen black people!</strong></p>

<p>Because Black Theology is biblical theology seeking to create new value-perspectives for the oppressed, <strong>it is revolutionary theology. It is a theology which confronts white society as the racist Antichrist,</strong> communicating to the oppressor that nothing will be spared in the fight for freedom. It is this attitude which distinguishes it from white American theology and identifies it with the religionists of the Third World. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you are wrong but I did want to point out some unbiased facts, this correlates directly with Hopi prophecy. Which is at the time the prophecy is to end, water, chief of elements will have found it&#39;s way back to it&#39;s original position.</p>

<p>His whole history is bogus. He&#39;s got CIA fingerprints all over it. Why quote his biography and his fake father as evidence when his whole story is shrouded in mystery? Why be disingenuous. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not him. </p>

<p>The Pahana, will be of the tribe of Dann. Which went up through Spain to Ireland to become the De Dannan. They&#39;ll be of Irish decent. That&#39;s where the story goes underground. </p>

<p>Do you know who it was St Patrick wiped out?</p>

<p>I agree, again, I&#39;m not saying you are wrong, I honestly have nothing to trust but his actions alone.</p>

<p>Not saying you&#39;re wrong here either, Stanley was a traveler against her parents, most likley hated them like a lot of rich kids do. I&#39;d think during the time, the last thing white parents would want is their daughter holding a minorities baby. There is always the chance of someone trying kill her off because of it. The same way the Kennedy&#39;s locked up their daughter.</p>

<p>It does not say this in the Bible, Jesus will return from the tribe of Judah.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 7:14King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also believe we&#39;ve had the discussion before that Ireland used to be controlled by blacks prior to Edom (whites) breaking free after the Hebrews fell away from God because Edom had placed a &quot;stumbling block&quot; against the Israelite&#39;s by causing them to sin. This why Jesus says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Revelations 2:14</p>

<p>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, <strong>who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock</strong> before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Genesis 27 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>

<p>39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</p>

<p>40 <strong>And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, whites did not control Ireland before a certain time which is hidden from history just like the Black Kings and Queens of Europe are hidden from history or even the first black settlers here in America, are again, hidden from history. This is why the word Slave or Slavic seems to pertain to whites more than blacks the further you go back in history. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve already had this war before, it&#39;s the reason why we only count the last 2000 years of history, because that is when Edom first rose to power as God said he naturally would.</p>
