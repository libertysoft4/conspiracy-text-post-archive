<p>If you are interested in the actual history of mythical creatures like minotaurs or centaurs, I strongly suggest you read On Monsters: An Unnatural History of Our Worst Fears Reprint Edition
by Stephen T. Asma. This book explains how these myths began in a very real and rational sense. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Unnatural-History-Worst-Fears/dp/0199798095/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;dpID=51FHx5FEXSL&amp;amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;amp;preST=_AC_UL320_SR212%2C320_&amp;amp;refRID=8W9V8HVF53DH8FQMCXV4">https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Unnatural-History-Worst-Fears/dp/0199798095/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;dpID=51FHx5FEXSL&amp;amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;amp;preST=_AC_UL320_SR212%2C320_&amp;amp;refRID=8W9V8HVF53DH8FQMCXV4</a></p>

<p>Elites actually worship Lucifer. They follow Aleister Crowley&#39;s demonology. <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/aleister-crowley-his-story-his-elite-ties-and-his-legacy/">http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/aleister-crowley-his-story-his-elite-ties-and-his-legacy/</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting your information, but read the links I&#39;ve suggested. Don&#39;t be led astray into thinking there is no hope, there most definitely is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know there is hope, but there isn&#39;t any reason to need hope. </p>

<p>As above, so below. </p>

<p>I understand they worship Lucifer but our understanding of the character/spirit/archetype of Lucifer is skewed. </p>

<p>He/she isn&#39;t evil, they make it evil (hence Satan).</p>

<p>The two different ideas have been tossed around with each other more than they should have. They both represent freedom from law and control (perhaps the elite think they can rebel against the inevitability of death). </p>

<p>As far as the black race goes, I&#39;m not racist. I hate everyone equally, kidding; I respect all life forms though. </p>

<p>They simply got fucked over from the beginning, it says so in the cuneiform, the Bible, and many other ancient texts. Not that I buy them hook line and sinker but if taken into account alongside history; a pattern emerges. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any of that garbage. All the bible is, is a good historical reference when I wanna see how the Israelites fucked up all the Middle Least for a brief period before getting ass-raped by Babylon. </p>

<p>God(s) doesn&#39;t give a flying fuck what happens to us down here. </p>

<p>If he did, society would be just, doctors would cure things, and 2pac would still be alive. </p>

<p>The Jews brought their sun god worship to the entire western world and we&#39;re just living in the aftermath. </p>

<p>Its not real.</p>

<p>Its a fairy tale, a control mechanism.</p>

<p>Whats not bullshit is the very real possibility of ancient advanced human civilizations who pretended to be gods. Now that&#39;s in the realm of possibility. That, we have some evidence for.</p>

<p>We have no evidence to suggest that god prefers to be called Yahweh, only your book says that and it also says I can have slaves and beat my family so it doesn&#39;t count. </p>

<p>This is a lie, the Bible does say that the world was made with God&#39;s love but it also explains Cain and Abel &amp; Jacob and Esau after the flood. Make no mistake, Edom is referenced in the Bible and how when God comes back, it will be the one people cut off from the earth.</p>

<p>His people fell and went through the 400 years after the stumbling block that was thrown before them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Genesis 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>European Zionism and it&#39;s teachings have led to the lynching, genocide, enslavement and hatred of Gods people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say God didn&#39;t respect all the people he created, there were gentiles he protected from the Israelite&#39;s but again there was one nation of people that God said he would come back to destroy.</p>

<p>In order to be a christian one has to acknowledge the order of God, not the rule of man.</p>

<p>But for starters yes, you are correct, reject the evil that is Edom with all you can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually Jesus was ethiopian and so was Mary (all 3 marys)</p>

<p>The only people pushing this black people mark of cain shit are mormons, gnostics freemasons and other quasimasonic klan members. But they don&#39;t believe it at highmost levels of &#39;gnosis&#39;.  They believe cain was white and that so was Jesus, and that their masters were blood-related to both (ie: jesus didn&#39;t die, he went on to have ancestors of royal family aka illuminati); that Cain was an ancestor of magdalene and that mag was queen of heaven and their organizational history includes a mummified head of either john-the-baptist (also white) or mary magdalene (white).  Black people aren&#39;t from Cain, because Enoch is the son of cain and enoch was the originator of their whole fireay apocalyptarian luciferian lineage.. (&#39;enochian magic--john dee--&gt; &#39;dee&#39; ism, get it?).
...google &#39;youtube walter veith cain&#39; and you&#39;ll get the whole history.</p>

<p>veith is a south african seventh day adventist research with a lot of skill and knowledge on this subject.</p>

<p>btw-I&#39;m not saying any of that above is true, only that that is what &#39;they&#39; believe.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure where you got this from. Alternative research may suggest &quot;Jesus&quot; was Ceasarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) son of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, and was sent to India/Ethiopia (by his mothers will) to protect him from the man who killed/overthrew Julius Caesar..</p>
