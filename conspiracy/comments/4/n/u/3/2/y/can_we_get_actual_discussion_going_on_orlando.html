        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At the time I will assume the deaths are real and crisis actors were there to completely control this from the start, but other assumptions are appreciated.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched everything unfold over the last few hours and I have seen information consistently disappear, A LOT of it, this was beyond any effort I have ever seen to create a narrative, to be clear I do not care about Islam but this needs to be said, the Islam extremism is completely artificially injected in here, this man had ties to the FBI and a security firm (G4S), this was not religiously inspired, they do everything they can to suppress the amount of shooters too and have no good reason for waiting hours before entering: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=HZ35V0etHiM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=HZ35V0etHiM</a></p>

<p>The stories got drastically edited where they first also said 2 shooters, then it was like 40 shots, then 100, then they immediately found an ID on the man, then he suddenly told his name during a call to 911, and supposedly during that call he also said he was with ISIS, that was claimed by the FBI before the name mention was even made, I think this will be the most damning piece of evidence, and needs to absolutely be acquired by an independent investigator, this is government ordered slaughter beyond anything we would have ever seen.</p>

<p>It seems like they had crisis actors outside waiting to give interviews right after and the right people at the right time to make videos, to make it seem as 1 shooter, as I said it also seems like they had the plan to completely control the narrative from the start with 1 shooter and as a terrorist, but that went wrong as shown above, that they instantly had multiple officers find an ID on him, we all know where that comes from, we need to try get officers to corroborate this, all records of this have been wiped I could find online and I only got a scre0enshot I think.</p>

<p>U.S. officials outside the FBI from the start seemed to realize the extent of this and tried to change what was going on and said there was no credible link to IS despite FBI claims although always in secrecy I assume for fear of retaliation, afterwards you had rather quickly the amaq agency claiming responsibility in the name of IS, just to be clear here, that&#39;s all bullshit, IS has no top hackers, they started a US/NATO program specifically for cyber warfare and recruited people for it, claims from this &#39;news&#39; agency are CIA/NATO, they tried to make it credible with this announcement because their original claim had failed and they rushed this out as someone had pointed out, but still reports got out from US intelligence that this proves nothing and there was no reason to assume any link.</p>

<p>After this they got in high gear and pumped up this story: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/12/orlando-gunman-tied-to-radical-imam-released-from-prison-last-year-say-law-enforcement-sources.html">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/12/orlando-gunman-tied-to-radical-imam-released-from-prison-last-year-say-law-enforcement-sources.html</a> so they now claim credible links and the senator who previously had no good reason to assume IS links suddenly became credible.</p>

<p>If the casualties are indeed this high, this is government organized slaughter with intent to create chaos, we need to demand completely independent investigation possible and if you can, try get the following going:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The witness claiming 2 guns needs to be found, his testimony is very damning and brought to light.</p></li>
<li><p>the 911 call has to be provided and shown it was exactly like they said, because the original claims were the ID was on the suspect.</p></li>
<li><p>Same with the other IS links they now claim, this all needs to be verified completely</p></li>
<li><p>Why there was a controlled explosion</p></li>
<li><p>They are claiming they won&#39;t release tapes between them for now during their supposed hostage rescue mission, bullshit, we will never see them otherwise, very important too</p></li>
<li><p>Claims were made of ar-15 and handgun, the witness his description was quite clear that automatic rifles were being used.</p></li>
<li><p>The same guy who kept the door shut is not being honest, he knowingly kept it shut according to the other witness.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can tell that they are constantly using the same people for interviews and they don&#39;t know what they are talking about, the story changes with them all the time and no emotion at all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more important than ever we get answers, and these points are the most important ones I can come up with because this reeks false flag, any suggestions or theories are accepted.</p>

<p>The FBI is now even asking for anyone to come and see them &quot;you might not know what you did or did not see&quot;</p>

<p>This seems like another attempt to create a credible profile with multiple witnesses that he was a Muslim and inspired as thus</p>

<p>We should demand independent investigation of the FBI, this is the absolute minimum, as long as they control it we will never know the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m watching MSNBC discuss how he got in the bar with an AR15 and &quot;had a drink&quot; before the attack. </p>

<p>Earlier I was hearing that he fought with the off-duty officer who was doing security. </p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Between these bits is a picture of an AR15 and the constant dribble that &quot;this is the primary weapon used in mass-shootings&quot; with run downs of past incidents and victim counts.</p>

<p>Talk of him being a terroist is definitely 2nd to him being able to get an AR15.</p>

<p>It really feels like the narrative is, &quot;If he couldn&#39;t get this rifle, he wouldn&#39;t have killed so many.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, 3 hours for the police to go in and confront him? Seriously? Did they just wait for him to run out of bullets/stop killing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize that was before he went in. How it got spun into him &quot;having a drink&quot; first is beyond me.</p>

<p>The other thing that bothers me is that it took 3 hours for the police to get in and stop him. I understand the difficulty in maybe identifying and subduing the shooter in a dark environment, but 3 hours?</p>

<p>Shit like this just makes me want to carry while not legally allowed to do so in places like bars/nightclubs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have completely shown this is a fraud exactly on the ar-15 point, not because of their clearly biased stance, but how it&#39;s described.</p>

<p>That fucking shit head who shut the door, he said it was a continuous shooting, he literally confirmed an automatic weapon was used, civilians can&#39;t buy those, I&#39;m gonna get that piece just to have that black on white, what he was using was not an ar-15, I love how they screwed themselves over on this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I will have to look into this further myself, but just wondering if anyone else has heard anything like this.</p>

<p>I live near Orlando.  I was just talking to my mom about what happened and she mentioned that my brother was downtown at a different club Saturday night.  According to him (via her), everyone was being told by police that they had to leave around midnight and that they were really pushy and rude about it and he didn&#39;t realize why until they got home and saw this on the news.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve been able to find, that seems too early for the two events to be related (news puts the shooting starting at 2am), but I don&#39;t know of any other reason police would be evacuating a nearby club (or more perhaps?) hours before they close on a Saturday night.  As I said, I would like to talk to him about it, but haven&#39;t gotten a chance yet being that I just heard this a few minutes ago.  In the meantime, I figured I&#39;d share this here to see if anyone else might have any information as to some unrelated reason this would have happened.  And if anyone has heard similar stories from people or were downtown that night, even better.  *Also, keep in mind that this may be a misunderstanding by my mom or my brother being drunk and confused.  I promise I&#39;m not posting bullshit intentionally if this turns out to be nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something like this I would absolutely expect to be on video. If police are kicking people out of a popular club 2 hours early, people are going to be pissed off and want to record it. Lack of video of the shooting seems at least somewhat plausible, as people would be scared for their life, but in the situation where cops are just forcing people out of a club, someone&#39;s going to record that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope collaboratively, all news, photos, testimonies and every other evidence can be collected and shared. 50+ dead over a 3 hour period and no one rushed the guy? Couldn&#39;t identify the bodies (apparently they don&#39;t allow ID&#39;s in that club unless you&#39;re the gunman)? Same with inside footage, 300 people there, 200 survived and no one has put a video or pictures up yet (that I&#39;ve been able to find)? It would take a special kind of person to believe the narrative being fed to us. Unfortunately, everyone I know seems to be that special kind of person. Reminds me of the news telling the nation that it was Osama Bin Laden before the dust had even settled.. Literally! </p>

They said they held the door because there were about 30 people in the alleyway, which the door led to. The people outside had to jump a fence, and he was holding the door shut incase the shooter&#39;s were trying to come out that way. He said he would be guilty for the rest of his life if he found out people died because of it. I cant find the thread it was in or remember the guys name.

    <div class="md"><p>So as a local, I agree that this video shows something rather asinine... But it also cuts out some important information about what is further up that same road. ORMC (Orlando Regional Medical Hospital), which is really one the biggest and arguably best ones in the area.</p>

<p>Small google maps of the distance between that local and the hospital.
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/gtslsy8">http://tinyurl.com/gtslsy8</a></p>

<p>I had left ORMC earlier that night from visiting my mother who had been in the hospital for the past 5 days, at approximately 12:45AM. By the time that we had gotten home and setup to get to bed my mother had begun messaging us that ORMC was on full lock down because of an active shooter, that at that time (~2:00-~2:30) was being reported in the building as possibly being in the hospital.</p>

<p>So to me, it seems completely reasonable that you would head with any injured person, north, up that road, back past the club, to the congregation of emergency vehicles and or to the hospital that is not but 3-4 blocks up the road. The ER being on the south side of the building on that road.</p>

<p>Just wanted to post some context for those not familiar with the area.</p>

<p>If people had just been massacred, where are all the families crying out for justice claiming the government was behind it.

    <div class="md"><p>Early on, they were saying, &quot;There are reports that he yelled &#39;Allahu Akbar&#39; just before opening fire. We&#39;re... not sure where that story started. It started circulating, and we don&#39;t have any confirmation that that actually happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Then a bit later, they just had a mysterious confirmation that that is in fact what happened, but still couldn&#39;t really reference any sources except government officials.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just one example of this whole thing not sounding right. That with the complete lack of any footage, especially for an event that dragged on for three hours, the interviews with people who were clearly low-budget crisis actors (even the most convincing person was obviously fake), and the fact that somehow they managed to hit on just about every single major issue that they&#39;ve been pushing for years (gun control, ISIS, LGBT, mass surveillance, war on terror, etc). It was waaaaay too convenient for the government. I call bullshit.</p>

<p>I only had to watch about 10 minutes of live coverage to be convinced that it was either all made up to begin with, or orchestrated by the government. The confirmation of the shooter&#39;s background and employment with a contractor who is known to do dirty government jobs only further proves in my mind that this is all a false flag.</p>

<p>Given the public outcry, especially by the LGBT community, I&#39;m pretty sure we just watched what&#39;s left of our freedoms die yesterday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Orlando and have been to this club myself... It&#39;s not like a typical club you would picture... Just a huge room basically with dance floor bar, the usual... Pulse actually had several different rooms you could go into with different themes and decor. Now, if the shooter is in a room two rooms away from you for example dont you think SOMEONE, in this day and age where social media rules, would have went live on Facebook, made a snapchat, face timed a loved one to announce what was going on? Someone would have easily been able to do this without the killer hearing or seeing if that&#39;s what they were scared of... (Since people are saying it&#39;s not surprising no one got it recorded, or since no one has come Forward with anything along those lines, its because people were to scared to think or consider social media) I call bullshit... Social media is life this day and age. Also, interesting to me that they haven&#39;t really talked about what they found inside the club, and we haven&#39;t been allowed to see the gun used... I could go on and on and i have never even considered conspiracy theories before about anything... The more i watch the news the more doesn&#39;t make sense though, even to a commoner like me.</p>

I&#39;m bothered that in our current political/statist climate that when something like this happens, I have no time to be outraged at the perpetrator, and I have no time to sympathize with the victims or their families, because I&#39;m scrambling frantically to see what the fallout is going to be for ME, how MY rights and privileges are going to be f-ed with by grandstanding politicians and attention-seekers and career-makers.

    <div class="md"><p>So, they&#39;re trying to supress the fact that there were multiple shooters by having thier &#39;paid crisis actors&#39; talk about thinking there might&#39;ve been multiple shooters.</p>

<p>And they&#39;re supressing info and putting forward a pre-planned narrative, and the evidence for that is the fact that the narrative keeps changing.</p>

<p>This &#39;changing narrative&#39; stuff always happens in the chaos of reporting a spree shooting. The one thing all witnesses agree on is that they didn&#39;t really know what the fuck was going on; changing reports of the number of shooters happens just about every time. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be more suspect if there <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a chaotic, confused narrative that varied from witness to witness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this were a staged event, and if the instigator were a government actor (remember that it might not be the US government, just as  it probably wasn&#39;t the US behind 9/11), it would follow a long pattern of public violence to achieve political goals.  Edward Bernays pioneered this with his work for United Fruit Company in the 1950s, engineering a coup of Guatemala for corporate interests by manipulating public fear of communism.  A similar template could be at work here, except using Islam as the scapegoat instead of communism.</p>

<p>it checks all the boxes, and just like 9/11, the MIC can spin this into trillions in spending. Heck, this could start a whole new phase in the War on Terror. It&#39;ll certainly at least spur a try at an assault weapons ban, that anti-gun groups can fundraise billions off of. It&#39;s a bonanza. Hell, they might even get a New Civil Rights Act out of it. </p>

<p>And keep in mind, those outcomes are with ZERO staging/false-flag. Those things would all still happen, and be hardcore exploited, regardless of the reality of the event. It&#39;s just our current political system. No crisis, especially one this big and globally reaching, will be let go to waste.
