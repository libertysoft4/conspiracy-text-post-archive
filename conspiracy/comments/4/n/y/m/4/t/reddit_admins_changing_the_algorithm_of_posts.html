<p>We’re introducing a change to Sticky Posts: They’ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.</p>

<p>We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wasnt the whole point of r/all to see how things were upvoted comparatively across all subs? why would they even need an algorithm, it should just be based on raw votes. this is literally just changing r/all to the same thing as the front page.</p>

<p>reddit has become a straight up tv station now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></p>

<p>Here we go, me attempting to tiptoe around the hot potato! I have had my fair share of warnings...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> All the major Reddit subs are being censored extensively. It happens from behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information on Reddit. If your post contains articles or reveal crimes about the following subjects: The US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economic Data, Economic Inequality, Social Unrest, the Corporate Owned Mass Media or certain well connected individuals you will become a targeted of their censorship. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Their favorite methods: 1) Algorithms that automatically detect specific wordings 2) Banning of certain independent media outlets. 3) Subtle vote rigging. 4) Manual removal of posts (last resort). 5) Intimidation. 6) Banning of accounts. 7) Allowing trolling by Shills &amp; Pundits. It is a very smooth and professional operation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> A core of loyal followers and employees. If they don&#39;t want you to see what is going on, you won&#39;t s see it. By design, we can&#39;t fully observe the process, nor can we tell the entities apart. We can make patient observations. We can take notes. Patterns emerges. We are not allowed to talk about our observations or criticize &quot;them&quot;, that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. Catch <del>17</del> 22!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> Reddit has been censoring users and independent media sources for years, with an increasing zeal, they are censoring them because they are compromising the narratives of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. They punch holes in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, polarization and lies. <em>The recipe for destroying the corporate propaganda is straight forward: Data and fact driven journalism with a high degree of integrity.</em> Reddit is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publication Inc</a> a de facto Corporate Owned Mass Media outlet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5) (As an Example)</em></strong> There is a lot of racist postings on the front page of r/conspiracy, thinly disguised as &quot;conspiracy anti-Israel posts&quot;. They constantly make up 10-20% of the front page volume if you don&#39;t repeatedly remove them. There is a lot of wedge issues, pitching various groups against each other, thinly disguised as conspiracies. On top of that you can add irrelevant trivia and celebrity gossip, all designed to distract and entertain. What you have left is maybe 5% of relevant content. This is how &quot;they&quot; are dumbing down the conspiracy forum and Reddit in general, a mere shadow if its former glory, an echo valley for idiots padding each other on the back. People kind of know, everything looks more and more like CNN and BBC, while the intelligentsia is fleeing the forum.</p></li>

<p>The bleating about Jizzrail got my spidey senses tingling. Complaining about racism - yet calling Saudi Arabia a barbarian shithole. Say anything you like about anyone, except for the j00s, right?</p>
