<p>This is truly absurd.  <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> makes international headlines for being censors and the admins back them up and punish <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> for filling the vacuum and fulfilling the demand for real uncensored information about the attack in Orlando.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Also I hope the users of conspiracy will understand that we will no longer be able to use stickies for posts made by non-mods or even our AMA guests.  We will have to find another way.  You can thank the admins for this horrible change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I was banned for calling Trump a moron and a con-man. I understand and accept the ban, and they have a right to censor their little sub, but that kind of bias is transparent and admitted. They don&#39;t owe anyone an apology.</p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s News sub is not supposed to be tainted by bias... but it is... ALL of Reddit is. The fact that they deny this is criminal.</p>

<p>Yeah, which is why I don&#39;t blame them for banning me. My comment did have other analysis and my reasoning behind calling him a con-man and moron. My point was that they do in fact censor. I was corroborating a claim with my experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;do you propose a better presidential option...&quot;</p>

<p>I did at the time. That was during the primaries. It was months ago. I&#39;m banned for life from that one comment. Am I supporting the Establishment GOP? Fuck no. Those pussies can go to hell. I wanted to vote for someone who made a career of fighting the establishment.</p>

<p>Am I voting for Trump now? Probably. I don&#39;t see anyone else coming along. I just think Trump will be a dumber version of George Bush and he&#39;ll be talked into doing stupid shit by Democrats and the Establishment GOP. He&#39;ll betray us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was shadowbanned from the_donald because I explained how the  drivers license and a car analogy isn&#39;t equal to the second amendment.</p>

<p>&quot;The car analogy doesn&#39;t work. You do not need a drivers license to own, purchase or drive a car on private property. You only need it for driving on government maintained, publicly funded roads.
You also do not have a constitutional right to convenient transportation.
You do have a right to own a firearm. And that right, shall not be infringed. It was written clearly, by framers who spent the previous decade fighting a war against a tyrannical government who did everything possible to disarm its rebellious citizenry.
Creating financial and bureaucratic hurdles is infringement. No different than requiring a permit and a test before you can post on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>That is what is going down. You&#39;ll be seeing extreme heavy-handedness, a mass increase in censorship  - led by the PRIVATE SECTOR in the near future. Indeed, the changes noted above are likely part of this &quot;anti-Hate speech&quot; agenda that was introduced by Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and others, and will spread like a virus across the web.</p>

<p>Any communication device can be used to do harm. We&#39;re obviously not going to stop people from communicating with one another.</p>

<p>Cars and guns are tools. These tools can be dangerous. As such, we don&#39;t allow just anyone to use them.</p>

Mass stabbing a are a lot harder to pull off than a mass shooting. Otherwise the cops would carry knives.<br/>
China isn&#39;t the US. We don&#39;t kill our own citizens with tanks.<br/>
No, that&#39;s silly.<br/>
All ideology is like religion. Gun fervor is no different.<br/>

Texas is also the largest state, with plenty of open and rural  spaces. Chicago and Austin are very different cities man.<br/>
You can&#39;t 3d print metal.<br/>
Stabbing are harder because guns are better at killing. Thats why mass shootings are more common than mass stabbings.<br/>
You knives to cook dinner. What purpose does a gun serve other than killing people? Quit trying to make an equivalence between knives and guns. There&#39;s a reason mass shooters use an AR and not a machete.<br/>
There&#39;s plenty of evidence to support that claim. The US has the most shootings and the most guns. Basic math.  </p>

Had an uncle who ran for mayor in a small city in Mexico and he had the majority vote up until the lights &quot;magically&quot; went out and the vote changed from 23% v 56% to a 49% v 40% . It was primary party (PRI) vs third party (Verde).

They are dividing in order Reddit  to concur and silence.</p>

<p>Spez is a complete unadulteraed sellout. Redditors don&#39;t matter as much as management decided [profiteering] concerns will dominate from here on out.</p>

<p>It is only a matter of time before reddit rests in the same boneyard as AOL, Yahoo, Myspace and all the other websites that sold their users down the river for quick money in the bank account.</p>

<p>And just like AOL, Yahoo, Myspace - a new better thing will come along and reddit will be the laughing stock of the internet past.</p>

<p>Huffman needs to get his money now and get out fast. I give reddit about 2 years before the ship really sinks.</p>

<p>Good for Huffman. Bad for reddit. But everything really is all about the money isn&#39;t it? Integrity, truth and morals don&#39;t pay the fucking penthouse rent.</p>

<p>EDIT- </p>

<p>What&#39;s this? His original post about thread stickies is gone  and this is what remains? He&#39;s a lying snake-in-the-grass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry. I guess I will be banned from somewhere for saying what I think anymore...but here goes.  The Donald Reddit is allowing blatant lies to be used in titles with no corrobation in the posts.  People are too damn lazy to actually read what is posted....so, the titles stick.  This can&#39;t be good.  Neither can the censorship.  I don&#39;t know what the answer is, but Reddit seems pretty shit right now to me....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My post here <a href="https://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4o5fl3/a_victim_of_the_waco_siege_1993_nsfl/">https://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4o5fl3/a_victim_of_the_waco_siege_1993_nsfl/</a> was just on the front page of <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a> not even an hour ago. That is to say - just one hour after posting, my thread was removed from the front page of <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a>. Now it is not even on the second or third page. As you can judge from the first few pages of <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a>, it does not take many points to reach the front page, nor to stay there.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the first time this has happened to me. Last time I posted a picture of Rhodesia to <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a>, it was completely SFW. I was shadowbanned, no warning, no message, no nothing.</p>

<p>The other time I posted an offensive joke to <a href="/r/ImGoingToHellForThis">/r/ImGoingToHellForThis</a> and my post was removed. When I messaged the mods asking why they muted me and didn&#39;t respond.</p>

<p>There is no other subreddit to post this to. They have complete control over the entire website.</p>

I question the american people&#39;s mental stability as a whole due to these two fucksticks being your goddamned candidates for the most powerful office in the free world. Seriously America, what the fuck is wrong with you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/u/Spez">/u/Spez</a>,</p>

<p>You said you found no evidence of censorship in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.  </p>

<p>I have some evidence for you right here, they have a shit ton of users on an automod shadowban list simply for their opinions on other subreddits.  </p>

<p>Go ahead, look at their automod.  look at what happens when I post on <a href="/r/News">/r/News</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nsiw1/state_of_the_subreddit_and_the_orlando_shooting/d4898hb">https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nsiw1/state_of_the_subreddit_and_the_orlando_shooting/d4898hb</a></p>

<p>see here I made a comment that was totally innocent.  here I&#39;ll make another one.</p>

<p>there you go I made one just for you! see <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a>! no censorship at all right?</p>
