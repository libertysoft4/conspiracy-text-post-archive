    <div class="md"><p>What I find strange about this guy is that he was arrested around 5am PDT, which would be 8am EST.  The shooting at Pulse ended shortly after 5am EST.  So that means this guy obviously was in Los Angeles already (he didnt hop in his car and drive there, an approx 30 hour drive from Indiana)</p>

<p>Now of course he could have been living in LA for a while, that information hasn&#39;t been released yet.  Either way, he already had weapons and gear because he was caught within hours of the Pulse shooting, and it was late at night/early morning.  Whenever he arrived in LA, he must have already been in possession of his weapons because it&#39;s basically impossible to buy an AR15 in CA.</p>

<p>I personally think (at least for now) he might be a person with mental issues who heard of the shooting and decided to be a copycat.  If that&#39;s true then he either gathered his weapons and hopped in the car or they were already in the car.  Either way he made a decision to cause some type of trouble.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t buy a story where this guy and the Pulse shooter were working together and trained at some camp.  He was in possession of tannerite, that&#39;s something you just buy in a store.  It&#39;s not a homemade device, it&#39;s off the shelf.  If he had some type of training you would think he would have something a little more sophisticated.  </p>

<p>He was also arrested in late Oct of last year for pointing a handgun at his neighbor.  Doesn&#39;t sound like a trained operative to me, it sounds like a mentally unbalanced person.</p>

<p>Add to all of that the fact that he was basically prowling around some neighborhood makes me think he had no real plan, at least not like the Pulse shooter.  This guy sounds like a buffoon.  I could be completely wrong but I don&#39;t think there is a real connection between these guys.</p>

<p>TL/DR:  the Pulse shooter obviously had a plan, Howell seems like a moron with guns in his car with no plan</p>

<p>I&#39;m having a hard time believing it at face value but it&#39;s intriguing to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The real truth of the story was released to a former Los Angeles County prosecutor who works for Get Off the BS by two Santa Monica police officers that have been issued gag orders under threat of Federal prosecution for talking further talking about the incident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears the LA Prosecutor actually works for the website. If this were a magazine or newspaper it wouldn&#39;t raise any eyebrows, but &quot;internet journalism&quot; doesn&#39;t exactly have a stellar reputation so the source is immediately questionable in many people&#39;s eyes.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It could, of course, be an outright hoax to get page hits and there&#39;s not much more that can be said about that. It could be misinformation, a hoax designed to get people already looking through conspiracy-tinted glasses investigating the wrong things. Or, it could be true. It&#39;s far too early to come to comclusions about the whole thing. The problem is that it <em>is</em> very intriguing and Timothy McVeigh isn&#39;t the only name to immediately come to mind.</p>

<p>If this story disappears, does that mean it was a hoax that ran it&#39;s course or does it mean that it&#39;s been buried?</p>
