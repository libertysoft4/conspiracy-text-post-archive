        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Put simply, polygraphs are for nonpsychopaths.  Psychopaths can beat the polygraph.  The hallmark of a psychopath is that they don&#39;t have the same autonomic reaction to lying as a non-psychopath.  </p>

<p>What this effectively means is they lie and get away with it.  It means that polygraph is implicitly flawed and cannot detect these people.  Because of false negatives created psychopaths not giving the reaction the polygraph is to detect.</p>

<p>Since application and experience, background check and polygraph are all that&#39;s needed, it would be easy for a psychopath with psychopath relationships to be able to get into the military intelligence.  Background checks involve an agent going to all your listed references and then visiting the people those references know.  If you&#39;re in a circle of psychopaths, then guess what?  They are going to lie on your behalf.  I knew a kid in college who pretended to be a doctor for another kid who wanted to pretend he was sick to get out of an exam, and they got away with it.  I was nonplussed.</p>

<p><strong>How to fix it</strong></p>

<p>Pass legislation requiring a test for psychopathy.  Basically give them the test under an fMRI.  Require EVERY government staff to take this test.  If they refuse, do not allow them in government.  They can ruin lives of everyone around them in the private workplace.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.neulaw.org/blog/1034-class-blog/3916-psychopathy-and-fmri-lie-detection">http://www.neulaw.org/blog/1034-class-blog/3916-psychopathy-and-fmri-lie-detection</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/194/3/229">http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/194/3/229</a></li>
</ul>

<p>What happens if private workplaces require psychopathy checks?  Well it would be a new type of illness that would be addressed wouldn&#39;t it?  Either they would be considered mentally ill and go on disability and be removed from both the public (gov) and private spheres, making them only consumers and citizens in the world, removed from 90% of society.  Or we can make them take psychopath only jobs.</p>

<p>Yep, that&#39;s just so unfair to them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points.  Thing is though that positions of power can literally change the brain and corrupt otherwise normal people over time.</p>

<p><a href="http://michaelinzlicht.com/publications/articles-chapters/power-changes-how-the-brain-responds-to-others-pdf">http://michaelinzlicht.com/publications/articles-chapters/power-changes-how-the-brain-responds-to-others-pdf</a></p>

<p>The big problem is power creep over time.  You have to keep tight checks and balances to make sure that even if someone is a psycho they are not able to use their position to harm others.  But the sociopathic people may try to push the limits of what they are able to get away with slowly over time.  Especially when it comes to high-level government positions where there are a lot of tough decisions that need to be made. They may not think what they are doing is wrong, they may just think it is what needs to be done, but still others suffer from their actions.  And it can be hard to determine what intentions the person had when they made their choice.</p>

<p>But we can see that slowly the system has become much more corrupted, one brick at a time.  And then it can foster an environment where that kind of behavior becomes more and more acceptable, and even necessary in certain cases (for example how even if a politician is opposed to overreaching lobbyist influence, lobbyist money can become necessary for politicians to compete with their peers who have no problems taking what is essentially bribe money).  We have to pay attention to who takes benefit from questionable actions and cut it off before it can spread.</p>

Once you&#39;re in the game on those kinds of levels and you want to keep on playing (for financial reasons or other incentives), then a lot, if not most of us, would go to extreme lenghts to keep their positions or advance them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the Milgram experiment in which ordinary volunteers got offered a lot of money for and commands by authority figures to supposedly torture people they couldn&#39;t see with increasing levels of electric shocks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust me -- you&#39;re not friends with psychopaths. Psychopaths use and abuse you until you&#39;re all out of energy or resources to give, and which point they discard you like a dirty rag. If you&#39;re friends with someone by definition, they are not a psychopath. Psychopaths are incapable of giving back in that sense. You may be friends with some people who are a little sick in the head, in which case, so am I! Psychopath simply means someone who is incapable of empathy, that feeling you get when you lie that hurts inside because you know it is wrong to do so, they do not feel that feeling. That voice telling you what is right and what is wrong on an emotional level. They know what is wrong, but they do not feel it is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychopaths have uses  such as being test pilots and any job that means taking risks.  They are the best risk takers.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t belong in any job that holds power over others because they have no interest in directing others away from harm. They make decisions based on one single criteria, that&#39;s personal greed. Harm to others has no meaning to them and they find no reason to avoid it. The greater problem for us all  now is that all power positions are currently controlled by sociopaths and psychopaths. More normal people are being influenced and co-opted  by them because everyone has to at least somewhat echo the characteristics of their boss. There are ever greater numbers of sociopaths and psychopaths for this reason.</p>

<p>&quot;Psychopathy personalities are described and characterized by shallow emotions (in particular reduced fear), stress tolerance, lacking empathy, coldheartedness, lacking guilt, egocentricity, superficial character, manipulativeness, irresponsibility, impulsivity and antisocial behaviors such as parasitic lifestyle and criminality.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into the ultimate scientific audience research that Timothy Leary produced for the G-men before they dosed him and his wife suicided, etc.  Circa 1957, on the traits of Army Colonels on the Interpersonal Behavior Cirumplex.  Leary reported 90% personality disorder in 600 Army Colonels.  &quot;Psychopath&quot; is a term that captures a narrow scientific definition of post-analysis Skinnerism.  Autocratic personality <em>in extremis</em> should be compared with the modern definition.</p>

<p>Comparing Leary with more modern sources, the measurements using the model of high-functioning psychopath, reality would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>1% of general population are <em>usually diagnosable psychopaths</em></li>
<li>Some percentage of psychopaths are &quot;high-functioning&quot; and not usually diagnosed as psychopaths.</li>
<li>High-functioning psychopaths seek political positions from which they can maximize their psychopathy more often than altruistic people seek political positions from which they can maximize their altruism, and more often ideological people seek political positions from which they can maximize their ideology, or the psychopaths try harder or cheat better, but somehow the psychopaths out-compete the altruists and the idealogs.</li>
<li>Psychopathic parents raise psychopathic kids more often than the general population, so psychopathic dynasties really do exist.</li>
</ul>

<p>And you end up with something like 50-90% psychopaths in power, depending on how you define &quot;power.&quot;  The people in charge of killing seem, no surprise, heavy on the psychopaths.  Maybe other organizations are less attractive to psychopaths, or maybe some organizations employ dangerous training or activities which create psychopathy in the general population.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve seen about The Way it Works, it&#39;s that the psychopaths cheat the system as a matter of course, receiving degrees, certifications, and even <em>elections</em> that honest people would still be working on, or would have missed out on entirely.  This may be part of the reason the psychos out-compete on the way to Who&#39;s Who.</p>

The scores correlated significantly with violence, alcohol use, and lower intelligence.[26] A 2009 British study by Coid et al., also using the PCL:SV, reported a community prevalence of 0.6% scoring 13 or more. The scores correlated with younger age, male gender, suicide attempts, violence, imprisonment, homelessness, drug dependence, personality disorders (histrionic, borderline and antisocial), and panic and obsessive–compulsive disorders.[166]</p>

<p>Psychopathy has a much higher prevalence in the convicted and incarcerated population, where it is thought that an estimated 15–25% of prisoners qualify for the diagnosis.[58] A study on a sample of inmates in the UK found that 7.7% of the inmates interviewed met the PCL-R cut-off of 30 for a diagnosis of psychopathy.[24] A study on a sample of inmates in Iran using the PCL:SV found a prevalence of 23% scoring 18 or more.[167]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re talking about psychopaths, not dentists. What psychology can measure is not psychopathy, they measure a disorder called anti-social personality disorder. They are categorically different; one is based on anti-social behavior and the other is  something only in the mind. Based on the nature of psychopathy, the very essence of being a &quot;together&quot; psychopath means that they would not get wound up in the system. That is why the science you alluded to says most are low level. Because the high level ones aren&#39;t caught. The high level ones do not get processed by the system, and they don&#39;t end up in jail. They own the jails. How do you think people like Hillary sleep at night? You think she goes to bed worried about the people? Does she worry about the men in the military she is sending, does she regret her tie-breaking vote as secretary of state to send men into Libya, thereby destabilizing an entire nation? I don&#39;t think so, I don&#39;t think a human who feels remorse and shame could possibly deem themselves viable for president after having done what she has done. That alone should tell you something about those in Washington. </p>
