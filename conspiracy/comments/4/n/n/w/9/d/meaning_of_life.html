    <div class="md"><p>The only compassion in the world is what we ourselves bring into it. The natural world is red in tooth and claw. It knows no compassion. Men, and maybe a few higher mammals, are capable of something completely new and unexpected -- compassion for others. Empathy. Feeling another&#39;s pain.</p>

<p>Our ability to express love and charity and kindness in our lives is a measure of our godliness. The more compassion we express, the closer to the divine we become. God is love. God is our compassion for our fellow creatures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal choice. If I don&#39;t give a fuck, who will? That and it makes my life better. Not in the short term. But the long term payoffs are the friends you make and keep. And the ones you lose but know you did right by. Perspective changes a lot when you get old and people you have known for twenty or thirty years call and want to see you before they die. Because you were a real friend. That is the stuff that really matters. Not how new the car was we went to the drs office in, but that we put water in the radiator three times and forgot to get gas.

    <div class="md"><p>I just wrote you big long answer and then screwed the pooch and deleted it. But my friend Ed passed away in January. I knew him for close to thirty years. It took a long time to get him to teach me how to do stained glass. The last couple of years as he got sicker, I carried him to appts. And we laughed. And ran out of gas. And laughed some more. No one can ever take that experience from me. None of it. And those that you call friends that only show up when they need something are not friends. But you already know that. 
I miss Ed. But I would rather miss him than not have had the good times.

    <div class="md"><p>Because he challenged me to be a better human being. I didn&#39;t get that then. I just really wanted to learn how to make beautiful glass pieces like he did. He made me prove I really wanted to. I had to read a couple of books, that I have now. He made me watch him make a whole lampshade. I had to pick up a lot of broken glass. And learn how to grind glass pieces on a old wetgrinder. Then.we did a few field trips to the museum
 To look at tiffanylamps. From below. With this new thing we paid thirtydollars forsowe could point at details in the structure. That old laserpointer was awesome. Then after a few years he let me make my own first pattern. He was about twenty years older than me, and army life during nam was not really his thing. So when he came back he marched against it. He taught me a lot through the years. Typing this out felt really good. Edwas my best friend. Over the years we hurt each other, fought, didn&#39;t speak for a few years, but when either one of us needed the other we were there. I have been very blessed. I can&#39;t explain any better why humans by and large are pretty awesome critters to be around.go meet new ones if you don&#39;t have the right ones around. They come in all shapes sizes and ages. You might be surprised who you find. And actually, I loved Ed. Never even kissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first step usually involves seeing the futility of finding happiness on the enervating plane (where everything slips through our fingers). Once one in at that stage, they begin to inquire into the nature of reality. According to the strength of one&#39;s inquiry one receives knowledge of that caliber.</p>

<p>I personally study the Bhagavad-Gita. It explains our situation on a very fundamental level and provides knowledge as the solution to our predicament. When we understand the nature of consciousness, we begin to shift our awareness away from the plane of change and instability to the plane of pure awareness and stability. When we reach that plane, even though we physically exist in the unstable world, because we are aware of our deeper, unchanging nature, it does not affect us. From here, one begins to find one&#39;s unique relationship to the whole, where one find&#39;s true satisfaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life isn&#39;t actually that bad in our modern times even when there are a couple of nutcases in control.</p>

<p>it could have been worse, much worse, just imagine a North Korea or Stalinist russia for the whole globe.</p>

<p>So what do I think is the meaning of life? Well existence exists and consciousness exists, this gives us some clues.</p>

<p>Imagine our universe without any biological life, just rocks in space? What would be its meaning?</p>

<p>To me there is no reason why biological life should exist, and there is no reason why life should strive to be more complex to create consciousness. In fact there is a lot of luck involve to reach consciousness. There is also no reason why existences exists in the first place, nothing, a story never told.</p>

<p>And yet it does exist, and so is consciousness.</p>

<p>Any yet when we die our consciousness is extinguished, out organic body turns to dust. If your body is in a vacuum with no bacteria is your body still alive organically or inert matter? We might be food but we still turn to dust, there is no great cycle of life where out organic body transforms into other cells, all you are is chemical fuel.</p>

<p>So our mind is extinguished, our body also, so why doesn&#39;t matter itself disappear?</p>

<p>Why does existence exist?</p>

<p>Now you might be thinking I am going in circles, and you are correct, I am just tracing the paths and you might see like me at the edges a blurry outline. This is my belief on what the meaning of life is.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the universe can be experienced just like it has no reason to exist. Yet it does in all its ways and stories.</p>
