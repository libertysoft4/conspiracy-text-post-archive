        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A friend of mine was at the nightclub the night of the shooting in Orlando. Luckily he got out unhurt. And he claimed that there were two shooters at the nightclub. He said the two shooters are friends that always go to that nightclub, like always go to it almost as if they&#39;re gay themselves. He even said he recognized them because they&#39;re always walking up and down the streets near the nightclub. He said that one of the shooters put the gun in their sweater and escaped into the crowd to leave the scene while the other shooter stayed back..... He is convinced he knew what he saw. And its funny because the media is spinning off as a lone wolf event, and they&#39;re even saying its a hate crime against gays even though Omar (one of the known shooters) might even be gay himself. </p>

<p>edit: Oh yeah, and he said he&#39;s afraid to report this to the police because he fears the government or the other shooter might try to kill him.</p>

<p>Obviously criminals don&#39;t care that it&#39;s a gun free zone. In fact, criminals seem to gravitate to these gun-free zones because they know that the people inside will almost certainly not be armed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Not to change the topic but I always found it unlikely that this supposedly tiny, hypersensitive kid with Aspergers could carry out such a deadly attack in a couple of minutes. Especially when the initial reports said that he was reloading way before his magazines were empty, like you would in a video game.</p>

<p>And ESPECIALLY, because the supposed &quot;long gun,&quot; aka the AR-15, that CT Chief Medical Examiner said was the gun which everyone was shot with was IN HIS TRUNK the whole time and none of the guns had his DNA on them. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re going with the &quot;people actually got shot angle,&quot; I think it&#39;s much more likely that it was carried out by a couple of skilled mercenary types, possibly the dude in the woods and Adam Lanza, if he even existed at all, was a patsy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good call, I almost forgot about that.</p>

<p>154 shots fired in 5 minutes with something like 96% accuracy. Hmm...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbs46.com/story/21814424/154-shots-in-5-minutes-sandy-hook-warrants-released">http://www.cbs46.com/story/21814424/154-shots-in-5-minutes-sandy-hook-warrants-released</a></p>

<p>And in addition to the accuracy, the timing is wild when you take reloading into account. </p>

<p>That&#39;s at least six magazines or more considering they claimed that he changed magazines multiple times, &quot;like you would in a video game,&quot; not emptying the clip:</p>

<p>&quot;Authorities determined that Lanza reloaded frequently during the shootings, sometimes firing only fifteen rounds from a thirty-round magazine. He shot all but two of his victims multiple times.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where conspiracy theories always go sideways in my opinion. It&#39;s totally plausible to discuss multiple shooters, media manipulation of events, censorship, scapegoating whole cultures, etc. It&#39;s not a very fruitful debate to deny that anyone actually died. I fully believe the shooting happened, and I fully believe those people died as a result.</p>

<p>Who organized the event, how they organized the event, and why they organized the event remains to be answered for me. One guy who did it for religious reasons doesn&#39;t seem like a legitimate motive to me, nor a feasible task. To shoot over 100 people in a matter of seconds without automatic weapons or years of marksmanship sounds highly implausible to me.</p>

<p>&quot;We had a team of crisis negotiators that talked to the suspect, trying to get as much information as possible, what we could do to help resolve the situation ... He wasn&#39;t asking a whole lot, and we were doing most of the asking,&quot; Mina said.</p>

<p>Mateen soon began talking about explosives and bombs, leading Mina to decide about 5 a.m. to detonate an explosive on an exterior wall to prevent potentially greater loss of life. The explosives did not penetrate the wall completely, so an armored vehicle was used to punch a 2-foot-by-3-foot hole in the wall about 2 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;We knew there would be an imminent loss of life,&quot; Mina said.</p>

<p>Hostages started running out, as did Mateen, who was killed in a shootout with SWAT team members. It turned out there were no explosives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does gun control have to do with the &quot;military industrial complex&quot;?</p>

<p>Military companies (Raytheon, Boeing, etc) don&#39;t make anything from civilian gun sales.</p>

<p>The very few companies who make guns for the military (colt, Beretta) make very, very little of their sales from civilians. They don&#39;t give a shit either way.</p>

<p>The companies who actually depend on civilian sales (Ruger, Remington, Browning, Winchester, Bushmaster, DPMS, etc, etc, etc) are not part of the &quot; military industrial complex&quot;. They are tiny by comparison, and do not supply the military.</p>

<p>So please, explain to me how gun sales are some conspiracy by the &quot;military industrial complex&quot;.</p>
