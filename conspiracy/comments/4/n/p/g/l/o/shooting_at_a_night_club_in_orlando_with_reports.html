        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Excuse the lack of links initially, I literally found the first applicable links and those are the ones I&#39;m using.</p>

<p>Initial Reports <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/346278-orlando-night-club-shooting/">HERE</a></p>

<p>Orlando Fire Dept. Large Scale Incident Channel <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/ctid/363">HERE</a>. I could not find any police channels at this time, but will keep looking. Sorry. </p>

<p>Orlando Police Twitter Account <a href="https://twitter.com/orlandopolice?lang=en">HERE</a></p>

<p>Also reports of a shooter inside a nearby hospital where victims were taken. Reports like <a href="https://twitter.com/sierradeaton/status/741895743540068352">these</a> are now beginning to surface.</p>

<p>Last number I&#39;ve seen was 54 injured/killed, but unconfirmed numbers. It&#39;s more than odd it&#39;s been almost an hour and not one major US news network has picked this up. </p>

<p>Please remember that if you listen in on emergency frequencies, do not post specifics of police/fire/EMS movements as they are happening. I WILL UPDATE AS THE EVENT CONTINUES TO UNFOLD. All times will be in Central Time due to exactly how quickly new information is obtained. Orlando is in the Easter Time Zone, so all times are 1 hour difference from posted times. Please excuse any formatting errors, they will be cleaned up later.</p>

<p>E1: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%40pulseorlando%20OR%20%23pulseorlando&amp;src=typd">HERE</a> is the live twitter feed. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/36510272">HERE</a> is the BBC article stating possible hostages.</p>

<p>E2: As of aproximately 0315 Central time Bomb Technicians, Crisis Negotiator and Hazardous Materials Technicians on scene. </p>

<p>E3: As of 0341 Central, Staging lane is clear, new crews tookng over responsibility of triage of victims aprox 20-30 mins ago. Arson investigator on scene at aprox 0343 C.</p>

<p>E4: <a href="https://youtu.be/oHtGv1fROSU">Here</a> is a video taken from the about the furthest the public was aloud to go. What sound like gunshots can be heard. 0344 C</p>

<p>E5: People have started posting memes of the shooter being identified as Sam Hyde, a comedian. These are not true. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/fruzsinaeordogh/2016/06/02/explaining-the-sam-hyde-as-mass-shooter-meme/#20cebd378d90">Relevant</a> article. It was a stupid thing 4chan does. Just so everyone knows. No news sites I have found have identified the shooter. 0353 Central</p>

<p>E6: No more reports of gunman at hospital can be found at this time. There are now however unconfirmed reports that the gunman inside the night club is strapping bombs to hostages. <a href="https://twitter.com/AliAkinK/status/741914313795862528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">HERE</a> is one of them. Keep in mind these reports are unconfirmed. 0357 CT</p>

<p>E7: Updated patient count as of 0358 CT is 40 trauma alerts sent to ORC, 2 more sent to another hospital per Orlando Large Incident channel linked to earlier. 42 total patients, including those who where not transported by ambulance. There was some traffic about 12 rescues, unknown what exactly that means at this time. Possibly number of hostages?</p>

<p>E8: At aprox. 0405 C, Orlando PD made a controlled explosion of some kind. Unknown what exactly it is. At 0412 C PD told FD to expect more patients for triage, sounds to be 3 more.</p>

<p>E9: 0416 C Emergency services on scene reports shots fired. Emergency services notified they may be requested to move</p>

<p>E10: 0418 Officer injury reported at OPD Command, OPD officers also brought out one victim to an awaiting ambulance. NonPD patient is a trauma alert to ORC. OPD is a self transport.</p>

<p>E11: More patients reported behind a business nearby that is a secured location. Possible OPD officer at 0422. One more sent trauma alert at aprox 0423. EOD command states one patient is being taken to transport units with multiple GSWs to chest and legs @ 0428</p>

<p>E12: OPD loaded multiple patients into a pickup and brought 3 to triage while others were taken directly to ORC, sounds as thought all are trauma alerts @ 0431. 2nd treatment group established with 2 Engine and 1 Ladder companies, roughly 10 with ALS capabilities. @ 0433. More non trauma patients arrive to triage at 0436</p>

<p>E13: OFD Command states &quot;They are bringing everyone out of one side of the club. They may be able to funnel all patients out of the club.&quot; Treatment requests 5 more transport units. @ 0438.</p>

<p>E14: EOD Command reports no more casualties will be brought out to Fire Command. @ 0439.</p>

<p>E15: OFD Command reports numerous Code Green and Code Yellow patients are waiting in triage, other Rescue units requested. @0433</p>

<p>E16: More and more people are circulating the photo of Sam Hyde, a comedian, and every time there is an incident like this 4chan circulates his image. Please remember these are false, as is stated by the article in Edit 5. </p>

<p>E17: OFD Units and Command notified to change location @0447</p>

<p>E18: At 0248 Eastern OPD tweeted they expected to have a news briefing held shortly thereafter. Unknown if this has been completed at this time. Cannot find anything but am listening to OFD Command channel actively. 0454C</p>

<p>E19: Rescue reported nearby. One rescue unit sent @0500</p>

<p>E20: At aprox 0504, there are reports active shooter has been neutralized. I cannot find an official statement by OPD at this time standby for further.</p>

<p>E21: At approximately 0450 C, OPD tweeted the shooter within the club is dead. Link to tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/OrlandoPolice/status/741931400392249344">here</a>. It is interesting to note they don&#39;t state &quot;the gunman&quot; they continue with &quot;inside the club&quot; seeming to imply there is another, but that is nothing more than pure speculation. Standby for further.</p>

<p>E22: EOD reports they are breaking out the robot at 0510 C. Rescue unit put on standby for EOD response 0522</p>

<p>E23: Command beginning to demobilize and debrief units at command post. Situation slowly drawing to a close. Staging area is now demobilized other than 4 transport units to finish out transports needed. 0514</p>

<p>E24: OFD Command is releasing most units to return to service. Command staff is now attending a debriefing 0521</p>

<p>E25: District 2 is now IC, channels moving to Tac 3 and Tac 4. 0527</p>

<p>E26: Large structure fire reported on major incident channel. 0530</p>

<p>E27: Public press conference to be held at 7am local. </p>

<p>E28: EOD command notified that &quot;the vehicle&quot; is the only &quot;suspected device.&quot; 0540</p>

<p>E29: Per CNN, OPD has NOT confirmed the shooter inside of the club is the only shooter. 0546 As of 0549 the reported structure fire is now taking up most of the traffic on the major incident channel on the linked website. Waiting until hearing further for actual hard numbers on victims. Personal estimate is between 50 and 60 injured and dead. At one point it was said over 40 trauma alerts were sent to one hospital alone (possibly the nearest Level 1 or 2 trauma center), added on with rescues in the double digits and an unstated number of deceased. 0552</p>

<p>E30: If you or anyone you know witnessed the Orlando shooting, please report to Orlando Police HQ, 100 S. Hughey Ave. to give a statement. OPD posted on twitter. Apart from Local PD, OCSO, Seminole County Sheriff and Florida state police agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigations is now on scene. 0609</p>

<p>E31: Press conference is live now, 0611, with continuing updates throughout the day. Shootout started with officer working that responded to shots fired call. Hostage situation ensued. One gunman dead with an &quot;assault type rifle&quot; and a handgun. OPD stated that there was a device on the gunman, and numerous deceased on the inside of the building. EOD units are now going through to verify a lack of secondary and tertiary devices. </p>

<p>E32: Aprox 3 months ago there was an MCI (Mass Casualty Incident) drill in Orlando. Relevant post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/49ue3n/masscasualty_drill_happening_in_the_orlando_area/">here</a>. </p>

<p>E33: Confirmed over 40 injured by OPD, estimated another 20+ dead inside the building per OPD press conference. 0631</p>

<p>E34: Alright, I wanted to go to bed when all of this started but I figured you guys would want to know all the stuff that happened too. So I stayed up way past my bed time. I&#39;m going to sleep now but thanks guys. Also a shoutout to my brothers in Orlando Fire who did an awesome job today (last night?) . I&#39;m definitely making it a point to stop by a few of their fire houses if I&#39;m ever in the city. If any of you are reading this, remember your defusings and debriefings. If you need a brother, reach out and I&#39;ve got you. Good night. 0735
5E35: Omar Mateen is the gunman&#39;s name, he pledged alliance to ISIS. 50 people are dead, another 53 injured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>50 people, is A LOT... I mean a whole LOT.  Even before news broke of this asshole being an ex security guard, I knew it would be someone heavily trained with firearms to be taking out that many people.  Even if you&#39;re in an enclosed area like he was, killing that many people, shows of someone who knew what they were doing, felt extremely comfortable around a firearm, and extremely comfortable killing.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn he was radicalized overseas, and fought overseas as well.  This isn&#39;t some disgruntled kid, who can never get laid, so he buys a gun, takes it to school and exacts his revenge... no, this is calculated, this is studied, this is prepared.  He knew what he was doing and unfortunately, did it extremely well.  I am a HUGE pro gun person, and this one actually scares me with regards to the 2nd amendment.  This is big... all the others haven&#39;t scared me at all in regards to the guns and laws, but something about this one, is gonna enact some serious change... and shockingly, right before Obama is getting out of office...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they have grown some integrity. Everyone knows there are CDC guidelines to try to prevent viral behaviors like suicides and in my opinion there isn&#39;t enough censorship to protect us from ourselves. Stop reporting so damn much on these shootings. It&#39;ll reduce the recurrence and potential for immortality through fame. Freedom of the press ends where it turns our schools and public places into war zones.</p>

<p>It&#39;s conditioning you to not speculate with your fellow redditors or community.  They don&#39;t want a bunch of people corroborating information like three shooters or two shooters or one.  They want to control the narrative.</p>

<p>Mass shooting?  Next step is to lock all the threads down.  Want to talk about this with your neighbors?  Nope, no talking with your neighbors about this either.  This is getting weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t frequent this sub very often, I&#39;m mostly in the aviation subs but I enjoy skimming through here from time to time when horrific stuff like this happens. I live in central Florida, not Orlando but very close to it and a couple things strike me as weird. The specific bar where all this took place is a good distance from where all the other bars are at and on any given weekend-night there are thousands of people at all the bars. It seems like if someone really wanted to kill as many people as they can, that&#39;s where they would go. Granted there are tons of cops in downtown Orlando around the bar streets on the weekends I guess that could have stopped an attack. Almost seems more like a hate crime attacking a gay night club when hundreds of bars down the street have way more targets. </p>

The scary report i heard was that the man who did it was apparently on the FBI watch list. That&#39;s why the FBI&#39;s freaking out right now in Orlando. Edit: Grammar </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, but when you look at where the lbgt clubs are here in Orlando, they tend to be more on the outskirts,  Revolution is on bumby, pulse is on south orange, and Parliament House is on OBT close to Fairvilla.  I&#39;m not sure the reason why it&#39;s like this, but that is how it is.  I think the practice of putting lbgt clubs in inconspicuous places started in NYC, which then was how gentrification started, but mostly to make sure their Patrons could feel safe whether they were open with their sexuality, publicly or not.  Sorry for the rant.  Went down there earlier and it&#39;s incredibly bizarre.  Not as if anything funny is going on, but the shock that something this crazy happened in my hometown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the writing has been on the wall for quite some time. After the Paris farce, I was on this sub predicting the same thing happening in America this year, although, I did also predict that there would be multiple simultaneous attacks. Granted, that would be more difficult to pull off, assuming this is some sort of false flag / hoax operation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s far too much political stuff going on between now and the end of the year, with the election, the Hillary investigation, TPP/TTIP, occupation in Syria...that you just knew some shit would hit the fan to keep the focus off it all. This is probably just the first of a slew of shootings we&#39;ll see from summer through fall.</p>

<p>Obama may be headed out of office, but Clinton is probably even more adamant about tighter gun laws. I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well here&#39;s the thing - we won&#39;t get much, if any, concrete evidence to support anything. Me personally, I don&#39;t truly think it&#39;s a complete hoax, but the ONLY reason I say that is because a longtime friend of my mom&#39;s claims to have lost a nephew in the attack. That&#39;s a somewhat vague, shill-sounding thing to say, but I can&#39;t imagine this person lying.</p>

<p>However, this is, without question, a false flag. If you&#39;re just popping on to the sub for the first time, and are unfamiliar with how most of us perceive geopolitics, then it might be a bit hard to grasp. But the mainstream media is in cahoots with whoever is perpetrating these events, whether it be the CIA, Mossad, ATF, DHS, whoever, and they won&#39;t hesitate to regurgitate whatever they&#39;re told.</p>

<p>I DO think the Paris attacks were probably a full-on hoax. The photo from inside the Bataclan is a joke, the venue was recently purchased by wealthy Jews, and the only people heard from who were inside were industry insiders and actors. The &quot;suicide bomb&quot; that went off in a cafe, which killed NO ONE but the bomber, by the way, did so little damage to the inside of the building, you&#39;d think someone just threw a plate and a glass.</p>

<p>Either way, we are witnessing Broadway theater on a massive scale, the likes of which the world has never seen before, and with all the disinformation that flows out after these attacks, we have to resign to the fact that we simply do not know what happened. But I&#39;m glad you&#39;re looking into this - I think anyone with a critical mind can look at this news coverage and wonder...&quot;is this person being honest? Why are some witnesses being ignored? Why are they letting media into the shooter&#39;s home just two days later?&quot;</p>

<p>It simply does not add up. Instead of investigating the facts, mainstream and social media is instead focused on how the attack can be prevented, and what laws need to change, which is <strong>exactly</strong> what the UN-installed government wants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been some recent debate about this terminology...the basic idea is that &quot;false flag&quot; pertains to <strong>anything</strong> that is done by one group of people and blamed on another, whether or not there are murders. A &quot;hoax&quot; is a completely fabricated event where no one died. So while a &quot;hoax&quot; is not interchangeable with a &quot;false flag&quot;, the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>In other words...&quot;false flag&quot; is a safer way of referring to anything we&#39;re lied to about, without sounding insensitive in case it wasn&#39;t really a hoax.</p>

<p>And wouldn&#39;t the left who have been against a Syrian invasion/ground war more than the right. Hate it when they put more forces in.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the best way to counter the lefts hate for war ... By killing 50 gay people in a gay bar. That would swing the sjw/left vote way further.</p>

<p>Edit : your right about gun control that&#39;s why it&#39;s always an m16 or ar15. Notice how it&#39;s never an ak like most Muslim terrorists use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t make sense.  If the Jews are trying to paint a picture of Muslims being dangerous wouldn&#39;t they profess loudly at every opportunity that he was Muslim?  Doesn&#39;t it make more sense that the site is moving in a more PC SJW direction and so the mods are skewing information that way?  And since Muslims are viewed largely as the societal underdogs the mods of these PC subreddits might want to protect their image by suppressing information that might spark hatred towards the group/religion as a whole?  That&#39;s the kind of self-contained small-scale conspiracy I can get behind.</p>

<p>For the US major news outlets to report on it took well over an hour. The <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> thread was what I first heard about it. I instantly began keeping the opening to the post in a notepad folder and flipping through major news websites. The BBC website had more information than any domestic news outlets until about three hours ago, which the incident has now been going on for roughly five hours.</p>

<p>Initial reports is some victims are stating there were 2 shooters. OPD has not confirmed the one dead gunman is the only gunman. EOD stated on the major incident channel that &quot;the vehicle is the only suspected device.&quot; My question is how did he manage to get a &quot;long arm&quot; like a rifle or shotgun past security? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orlando resident here.</p>

<p>The Orlando shooter seems to have a Muslim name (&quot;Omar Mateen&quot;), so they&#39;re already trying to make ties to Islamic fundamentalism and terrorist groups despite the fact that it was most likely a hate crime.</p>

<p>This all comes within a week of a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that concealed carry is not protected in the constitution, allowing them to make it difficult/impossible for Americans to apply for and receive CCW permits.</p>

<p>Central Florida has some pretty lax gun policies--University of Central Florida students are even allowed to carry their guns in their cars on campus. I have a glaring suspicion that this will all soon change, with legislators citing &quot;the deadliest mass shooting in US history.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>My message: if you haven&#39;t gotten a license to carry your own protective equipment, it would be in your best interest to do so now.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It always makes me wonder when there are initially reports of 2 shooters, but then it ends up there was just one. We saw this with the Aurora shooting and now this one. There were reports that one shooter left the club and started running down the street towards the hospital while shooting, which is why the hospital was put on lock down. Now, the media is saying that there was a lone wolf gunman that was killed inside the nightclub. IF there wasn&#39;t a second shooter, I&#39;m interested to hear the reasoning for why the hospital was put on lock down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plausible, but that doesn&#39;t fit the scenario I heard unless the cop got scared and started running down the street away from the club while shooting, which I&#39;m sure would be against protocol as innocents were in the streets trying to escape. </p>

<p>Aside from the reports of two shooters in recent incidents, the idea of accomplices has been a very grey area for the police. For example, the most glaring instance in the past few years has been the idea that John Wayne Gacy had one or more accomplices as some of the victims found buried in his basement came up missing while Gacy was, in fact, out of town. A few years ago, it was reported that Chicago was preparing to arrest a person they suspected was working with Gacy, then it fell off the radar, and never spoken of again. Why the secrecy? Things just get curiouser and curiouser...</p>

Let&#39;s be honest here, this just furthers the elitist agenda because that censorship in itself will only increase hate against that group and it will only divide people further. Plus we&#39;ll see the gun debate brought right back to the forefront and it&#39;ll be part of the election cycle for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think we&#39;d be better off with less restrictions to guns?  I believe we need to reduce firearm proliferation -- majorly.  Limit the manufacture of guns, limit the importation of firearms, limit the access to ammunition, ban videos of sports shooting on youtube and other websites --like FPSRussian because they entertain and create a wreckless gun culture that only fuels proliferation.  </p>

<p>Firearm proliferation does not thwart foreign invasion, does not thwart surveillance on citizens, or thwart diminished rights ... all of these things occur with gun proliferation.  Access to education and equality in society are the only things that thwart gun violence or violent extremism in general</p>

<p>The only thing that proliferation of guns provides is the enrichment for stakeholders in the arms industry.  I think it&#39;s funny that people in this sub are afraid or dismissive of socialism and capitalism but it&#39;s capitalism that created US fascination with gun culture ... yet any discussions of curtailing capitalism doesn&#39;t address the gun culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not for takings guns away but what would people with Guns do in this situation? Should everyone be carrying all the time? And even then, the element of complete surprise and shock and being placed under fire...!is every member of society supposed to know the tactics of a trained marine? There needs to be better security at these places. More guns in the hands of everyday pedestrians doesn&#39;t solve this problem. And we need to look at the underlying mental illness problem that is so big in our country.  We have legislation that makes it hard for people to get the help and treatment they need but then those shame people have easy access to dangerous weapons. We will continue to see these types of events as long as we do nothing about it. One place to start is making it easier for people to access mental health recourses. And maybe we start addressing religious extremism because that always seems to play a factor in these events.  It&#39;s becoming more and more clear that religiously minded individuals &quot;not all&quot; tend to have a passion to stop violators of their beliefs and we are seeing the results of delusional thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by <em>more</em> gun control?  Obama hasn&#39;t passed a single stitch of Federal gun laws in his entire tenure.  He came into office with a super majority in the House and Senate so he could have passed anything he wanted to and he didn&#39;t.  The &quot;Obama is coming for your guns&quot; was just a slogan that the NRA and gun advocates used to get people to run to the store and stockpile guns and ammo and donate money.  If he wanted to actually pass sweeping gun legislation he could have done it when he had the super majority and nothing could have stopped him.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t buy into the idea that &quot;Obammer gunna taek muh guns.&quot; line, his priority when he got into office was Obamacare. He knew it would be a fight, and it was. He spent a lot of political capital on it, good or bad. He&#39;s only recently began focusing on guns, but if her were going to try and pass gun legislation of any kind, now would be the time to do it. Historically it has always caused candidates who were openly anti gun to lose votes in national elections. He doesn&#39;t have to worry about that now. Especially with the recent 9th Circuit court ruling, and ATF no longer allowing certain types of FFL licenses and pressuring bans on certain types of ammunition that have been allowed for import for years. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s <em>really</em> antigun, or if he&#39;s just doing it because it&#39;s somewhat in vogue and may help drum up support for the Dems in November. But either way, he&#39;ll mention gun control. </p>

<p>Edit: I should also point out that the Executive Branch, which he is in control of, has disallowed import of types of ammunition (7n6), attempted to ban making certain types of ammunition (M855), no longer allows appeals to a NICS denial (so even if I were legally allowed to buy a firearm, but was confused with someone who wasn&#39;t, I am pretty much barred from buying a firearm from an FFL until this is fixed), ATF issuing contradicting rulings on hardware that fits into a legal gray area so that what they say <em>is</em> law because they could use original wording of an arguably unconstitutional bill and contort it to fit an extremely obscure definition to make legal gun owners potential felons (redesign was the word, and shouldering a brace was the action). On top of that there was the import ban on rifles that are rarely used in crimes and account for less than 1% of firearms deaths every year because they&#39;re &quot;too dangerous.&quot; Then there&#39;s the fact that the BATFE holds contradictary viewpoints that &quot;trusts are not people,&quot; and NFA trusts are a thing, but they&#39;ll try and prosecute a trust holder who they gave a tax stamp to because they don&#39;t want him having the gun they gave him the tax stamp for already. He may not have passed any bills, but he&#39;s done it through executive power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course he&#39;ll mention gun control because that&#39;s good campaign fodder for both sides.  The Republicans raise money saying they&#39;ll protect your 2nd amendment because Hillary wants to ban your guns and Hillary will raise money promising to pass &quot;comprehensive common sense gun legislation.&quot;  This happens every single election and no meaningful federal legislation gets passed because a majority of the members of Congress receive donations from the NRA.  If Obama <em>really</em> was interested in gun control he had a super majority when he entered office and after Sandy Hook he had enough public support for a new federal universal background check law that he could have signed an executive order for it citing public polling data as enough reason to take matters into his own hands.  He didn&#39;t do that.  He said congress needed to get it done even though he signed a hundred executive orders for other shit.  No real gun laws get passed because if that happens both sides lose their fundraising ability on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All that stuff is mostly a lot of &quot;who gives a shit&quot; stuff that the NRA doesn&#39;t even get worked up about.  I&#39;m talking about actual federal legislation that would effect normal civilian gun owners.  When people talk about gun control they are afraid of gun bans and further limitations and national registries.  Having certain types of ammo no longer allowed to be imported etc doesn&#39;t really matter.  That&#39;s not a strong enough issue to raise funds over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rising number of lawful gun owners being denied their right because the system can&#39;t tell them from the felon across the country isn&#39;t a big deal? I wonder if there would be an outlash over it if people weren&#39;t allowed to vote or have 4A rights or have freedom of speech because they were confused with a felon. People would flip shit because they are controlling your birthright.</p>

<p>Artificially increasing the price of ammunition is all the ammo bans did. Which doesn&#39;t sound like much, but what would happen if the prices of computers were artificially doubled because it was deemed typed words were &quot;too hurtful&quot; when the computers aren&#39;t used in crime to a measurable degree. </p>

<p>These are issues to raise funds over. Especially the ammo bans raised a bunch of funds for the NRA. The NRA might not be the greatest thing, but they&#39;re the biggest protector of gun rights in the US, especially the NRA-ILA. That&#39;s why even though I hate them, I&#39;m a member. Just like I fucking hate the ACLU sometimes, but I&#39;m still a member. Liberty is liberty. Freedom is freedom. That&#39;s all I, and most others, want.</p>

It&#39;s a cheap fundraising tactic.  There&#39;s never a democrat who isn&#39;t coming for your guns but it never happens.  Gun sales and NRA donations skyrocket and congress members get paid and that&#39;s it.  It&#39;s extortion:  give us donations or your 2nd amendment is gone.  I don&#39;t believe that.

If the shooter was unaffiliated, then he was working with whatever his budget was personally and no international network that can easily get fully automatic firearms smuggled into a country where they&#39;re illegal.</p>

<p>Besides that, in the US AR15s are more cost effictive, ammo is cheap and plentiful, accessories are present. They are the most popular rifle in the US</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is also other explanations, such as when people who aren&#39;t used to these stresses find themselves in positions where these stresses are present, they usually &quot;black out&quot; and act on base instinct. In situations like officer involved shootings, for example, accounts given right after the incident can, and it&#39;s not uncommon for them to, differ greatly from what happened. The officer will think they fired three rounds, but actually fired twelve. Usually around 48 hours the mind has the chance to process all the information it took in during the stressed state and begin to put it in order. After 48 hours (or so), officers are usually able to walk through the incident in detail and give correct information. So it may have been two &quot;snip-its&quot; of memory that just make the person think they saw two shooters, but might have actually only been one.</p>

<p>Another thing to ponder: David Rockefeller&#39;s 101st birthday is coming on June 10th (if my memory serves me right (I won&#39;t bother googling it right now)). Perhaps &quot;someone&quot; will &quot;celebrate&quot; it by pulling off a really spectacular &quot;ISIS&quot; attack. Or something along those lines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I later found out that his birthday was today, the 12th. And that it also was George H. W. Bush&#39; birthday. And that Queen Elizabeth would turn 90 the day before. </p>

<p>Jesus.  The government has proven itself to be the single biggest <em>enemy</em> of the people and the population throughout all of history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So they assume that anyone involved in these events is an actor with makeup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#39;s definitely a possibility as well, however.  There seems to have been a lot of crisis actor fuckery that&#39;s happened as of the past few years.  That&#39;s for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s much easier for the government to just create real death and injuries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that too as well.</p>

<p>I mean the government, or special interest groups, or clandestine blackop projects, or whatever, can be involved in all these things.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the real point here is that TPTB can use anything really (the government, corporate groups, to military ops, etc) to exact all manner of heinous, false flag shit against the population.</p>
