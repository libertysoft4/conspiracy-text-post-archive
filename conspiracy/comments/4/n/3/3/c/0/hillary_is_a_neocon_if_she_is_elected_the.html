Nuland was Principal Deputy National Security Advisor to VP Dick Cheney, and served as Hillary&#39;s State Dept Spokesperson. This is a direct link to a Cheney loyalist and needs little explaining. </p>

<p>Kagan himself, as well as fellow PNAC vet Richard Perle and other neocon titans have <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/18998/neocon-war-hawks-want-hillary-clinton-over-donald-trump.-no-surprisetheyve">openly voiced support</a> for Hillary.

<p>With her ascendancy to the throne the hawk/dove dichotomy that once existed between the right and left will have vanished. Endless war will simply be the American Way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the difference. Hillary is the fusion of the two. She started as a neoliberal with NAFTA and Hillarycare but after Benghazi and Syria showed her duality. Both groups seek to privatize the US into oblivion, neocons are distinguished by being the military arm of the Israeli Likud party. Hillary has become that, hence she is a neocon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neoliberal is an economic distinction, both parties are neoliberal except on the fringes of either (Bernie to the left, Trump/Pat Buchanan types on the right). Neoconservative is a foreign policy viewpoint, basically &quot;benevolent (in their view) imperialism&quot; attacking countries to spread &quot;democracy&quot; aka turning them into clients. You can be both, one, or the other. They&#39;re both money and power driven globalist ideologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, neoliberalism is globalist super capitalism. It&#39;s using something that should be used to free and uplift a country like free markets (IMO) into something that subverts national sovereignty at the behest of unaccountable multinationals. If you want to neoliberalism in action look at Greece right now.  Neoconservatism is invading and occupying Iraq because Saddam gave Israel goosebumps under the guise of liberating them from tyranny.</p>

<p>Neoconservatism is the brainchild of German American Jew Leo Strauss but came really came into its own when a bunch of Jewish Trotskyists in the 60s 70s who were affiliated with Commentary magazine (Kristol and Podhoretz are names that come to mind) jumped ship en masse to the Republican Party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Greece is the classic modern example, Russia is struggling with it now (after Putin saved them from their last bout), and Obama, the neoliberal overlord, is pushing the end-all trade agreements on both sides of our continent. Neoconservatism definitely began with Strauss but I would say it didn&#39;t truly get put into action until Bush II. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/1/27/444438/-">Clinton</a> wouldn&#39;t play ball with the neocons so they leaked the Lewinsky scandal and ruined him. Netanyahu even said, &quot;Monica Lewinsky has saved Israel&quot;. Bush II didn&#39;t know foreign policy from a turkey sandwich so it wasn&#39;t until he ascended that they could finally have full control over US action abroad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, pretty much all of the candidates are neo-liberals. Bush was a conservative neoconservative neoliberal, which seems to confuse a lot of people.</p>

<p>Neoconservative is a foreign policy position which is pretty much &quot;We&#39;re going to fuck up the middle east for oil.&quot; It&#39;s mostly a tagline for &quot;What the Bush people did&quot; and will not really exist as an ideology before or after that. There might eventual be an actual neoconservative ideology, but it will be called something else.</p>

<p>I recommend anyone read it in understanding neolibs and neocons.</p>

<p>The difference is what ideals they stress but the outcome is equal. To say she is a neocon is true in how she acts, especially in foreign policy but because she is on the Dem side of the aisle in name, she subscribes more the to the neolib side because she stresses those ideals more than the neocon ideals. But like I said, the outcome is the same so no matter what angle these political leaders come from they continue to destroy the democracy we think exists but is really a myth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2014, Robert Kagan, the foreign-policy analyst widely regarded as the leading voice of neoconservatism (he prefers the term “liberal interventionism”) told the New York Times that he feels “comfortable” with Clinton’s foreign policy. “If she pursues a policy which we think she will pursue,” he said, “it’s something that might have been called neocon, but clearly her supporters are not going to call it that; they are going to call it something else.” In 2011 Clinton put Kagan on the Foreign Affairs Policy Board, a standing group of outside advisors to the secretary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By 2011, in fact, Clinton and Obama had, in effect, reversed positions on Afghanistan, with the secretary lobbying for diplomacy and the president — though increasingly disillusioned about the effectiveness of COIN — authorizing ever more targeted killings by drones and special operations forces. Over the next two years, Clinton would often find herself blocked by a White House apparently in thrall to a counterterror approach to the fight against extremism. In The Dispensable Nation, Vali Nasr, a leading scholar of international relations who served on Holbrooke&#39;s staff, argues that Obama’s protectors in the White House feared that Obama would be seen as “soft” if he chose a political rather than a military solution in Afghanistan and elsewhere, leaving Clinton as “the lone voice making the case for diplomacy.” Many former Clinton officials consider the argument somewhat overdrawn—key White House officials were quite sympathetic to the call for talks — but fundamentally accurate. Clinton never did fully succeed in persuading Petraeus that the time had come to pursue peace talks. &quot;It too often became surge surge surge, drone drone drone,&quot; says Harold Koh, Clinton&#39;s former legal advisor. Clintonism properly understood, he asserts, is &quot;nesting a hard-power approach into a broader smart-power strategy — development, diplomacy, public-private partnerships, rule of law.&quot;</p>

<p>If that’s neoconservatism, then neoconservatism has changed unrecognizably since the Iraq war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, but that&#39;s one state, and arguably the first state the neocons really went after. We had already made Afghanistan as much of a client as needed - poppy production was back online, Osama was &quot;taken out&quot; by May of 2011, there really wasn&#39;t any reason to surge more troops when the rest of the 7-country list had a few more to check off. So to use that one example as a counter-argument to Hillary&#39;s neoconservative tendencies is, IMO, insufficient. Email evidence shows she was already busy plotting for Syria at this time, I don&#39;t need to mention Libya, anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a pdf title: <a href="https://istifhane.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/americannightmare-brown.pdf">American Nightmare: Neoliberalism, Neoconservatism, and De-Democratization</a></p>

<p>I recommend anyone read it in understanding neolibs and necons.</p>

<p>The difference is what ideals they stress but the outcome is equal. To say she is a neocon is true is how she acts, especially in foreign policy but because she is on the Dem side of the aisle in name, she subscribes more the to the neolib side because she stresses those ideals more than the neocon ideals. But like I said, the outcome is the same so no matter what angle these political leaders come from they continue to destroy the democracy we think exists but is really a myth.</p>
