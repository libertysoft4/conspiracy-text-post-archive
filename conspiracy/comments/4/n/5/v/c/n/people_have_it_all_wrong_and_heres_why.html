        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, the ONLY enemy is the Central Bankers, who are the top level Globalists. However, they are NOT the target.</p>

<p>Their weapon of POISON is the “Federal Reserve Notes” Currency Supply, because they, the Central Bankers have taken it over and are using it for great evil, however, We The People are Constitutionally MANDATED to be using it for great good. The “Federal Reserve Note” Currency Supply which is privately created and printed as debt with interest to the Central Bankers who are Globalists, MUST be Our ONLY target. There are so MANY dumb fuckers running all around saying that the enemy is the: Rich People, Whites, Blacks, Jews, Muslims, Illegals, Jesuits, or whatever fucking group they have reason to prefer.</p>

<p>But NO, the “Federal Reserve Notes” Currency Supply is the weapon of POISON that the Central Bankers who are Globalists are using to cause ALL the problems in the World. All the problems in the world, and all the wars, are started and funded by the Central Bankers who are Globalists who privately create and lend their “Federal Reserve Notes” to both sides in wars and political parties. They are bribing the whole fucking world.</p>

<p>The Central Bankers who are Globalists happen to be a very, very small group of Jews, who own ALL the big banks, and ALL the big banks together privately own the Federal Reserve Bank. Every loan borrowed from one of their banks is just some numbers added to their electronic balance sheet, out of thin air. The Federal Reserve Bank does the same thing and also prints money and lends it to the government, again as debt to they, the Central Bankers.</p>

<p>Therefore, the ENTIRE “Federal Reserve Notes” Currency Supply is PRIVATELY created/printed as debt to the fucking Central Bankers who are Globalists, and the Politicians are being paid to ALLOW this to continue, THIS is the problem. Therefore, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 MUST be repealed and a Sovereign American Currency created/printed by We The People. Of course by doing this We would create the Currency Supply that We The People use, therefore, it would NOT be borrowed, and would be National Debt FREE, and Our Work hours would not be being used to pay the entire Currency Supply back to the Central Bankers with interest, which gives them ALL the power. Instead, Our work hours would not only pay us Individually, but also pay We The People as a whole, because if the National Bank were public and owned by We The People, the interest on Currency lent by it would be used to pay for schools, libraries, and anything else We The People might want and need. Right now, the Federal Reserve Bank is 100% PRIVATELY owned!!!!! and the every Federal Reserve Note AND interest on it is being paid back to the Central Bankers who are Globalists!!!!! Do you get it YET?</p>

<p>We The People MUST end the privately created/printed “Federal Reserve Note” Currency Supply, and REPLACE it with A Sovereign American Currency Supply, which would NOT be borrowed from the Central Bankers who are Globalists. Because if the We The People use the Currency Supply that the Central Bankers who are Globalists are creating as debt with interest to themselves, then the Central Bankers are ending up with ALL the Currency.  Do you get it YET?</p>

<p>Then they use this Currency that just got paid back to them with interest since they were the ones who created/printed it out of thin air, to buy up ALL the things of real value. YES, it means they are creating/printing the Currency and getting it all back with interest for FREE!!!!!, and they using it to transfer all the Wealth of the People to themselves. Do you get it YET? These Central Bankers who are Globalists are a very small group of individuals who happen to be JEWS, and they own all the central banks in the World!!!!!</p>

<p>Now, since they are getting UNLIMITED Currency this way, they can go around and literally BUY everything that has REAL value, and is not just paper, such as land, precious metals, resources, patents, corporations, and they can bribe all the politicians of all the governments in the world because they are also creating/printing ALL those Countries Currencies also because they PRIVATELY own ALL central banks worldwide, including the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank of International Settlements, and the International Monetary Fund. Do you get it YET?</p>

<p>Jesus FUCKING christ. The enemy is the Central Bankers who are Globalists BUT the ONLY thing that is giving them ANY power is that they are privately creating/printing the Currency Supplies out of thin air as DEBT to THEMSELVES!!!!! DO NOT say the cause of the problem is something OTHER then the privately created/printed Federal Reserve Note Currency Supply!!!!! Because that would be a TOTAL lie. Do you get it YET?</p>

<p>Jesus FUCKING Christ. </p>

<p>Are there some groups that are Globalists by nature, yes, the Central Bankers, the Religious Jews by way of their Globalist religious text the Talmud, the Muslims by way of their Globalist religious text the Koran, the Democrats/Liberals who want socialism/communism, and the politicians that are bribed by the Central Bankers, and there will ALWAYS be Globalist groups, however, the PROBLEM is giving them POWER, and they are getting an EXPONENTIALLY huge amount of power over We The People by privately creating/printing the Currency Supply that We The People are being forced to use because the government is borrowing it when the government is supposed to be creating it!!!!! </p>

<p>The Central Bankers who are Globalists are using the unlimited Currency that they are getting not only transfer all the wealth to themselves, but also to fund and do: Invasions of Countries especially in the Middle East, arm their proxy army ISIS, spray GeoEngineering Aluminum into the atmosphere which causes Autism, Alzheimer’s, and Cancer, this is part of their depopulation agenda which they have PUBLICLY stated. The Bankers/Globalists are trying to keep the People repressed and weak so they will be to weal and stupid to repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, signed by the bribed and incompetent Woodrow Wilson, which gave the Bankers/Globalists the power to PRIVATELY create/print the Currency Supply as debt to themselves. Do you get it YET? Do you get it YET?</p>

<p>Stop GIVING the Central Bankers who are Globalists the POWER by continuing to borrow the the “Federal Reserve Note” Currency Supply the Central Bankers who are Globalists privately print/create as debt to themselves!!!!! Start Printing/Creating a Sovereign American Currency Supply and use that instead, this will require no National Debt at all, and NOT give the Central Bankers who are Globalists unlimited Currency to use AGAINST you.  Do you get it YET?</p>

<p>No, God DOESN’T forgive, and you will pay a price in YOUR lifetime if you JUST sit on your ass and NOT do a fucking thing about this.</p>

<p>One last note for the FUCKERS who don’t understand what FIAT is. FIAT is perfectly fine if the Currency is being created/printed by the People and BACKED as Legal Tender used in the payment of the Work of the We The People, who are intelligent and dependable. Currency DOES NOT have to be backed by gold, oil, or some precious metal, because that still gives all the Power to the Central Bankers who are Globalists because they already bought ALL that shit up with the Federal Reserve Notes which are all paid back to them which they printed out of thin air in the first place!!!!!</p>

<p>Germany created a Sovereign Currency backed ONLY by the fact that it was Legal Tender used in the payment of the Work of the German People, who are intelligent and dependable, such that Germany became so strong that Churchill said: 
“You must understand that this war is not against Hitler or National Socialism, but against the strength of the German people, which is to be smashed once and for all, regardless of whether it is in the hands of Hitler or a Jesuit priest..” --Winston Churchill</p>

<p>The answer is above, so NO, the problem IS NOT “rich white people”, as the paid fucking Liberal/Democrat thugs who are disrupting the Trump rallies are saying, the problem the that the ENTIRE “Federal Reserve Notes” Currency Supply is PRIVATELY created/printed as debt to the fucking Central Bankers who are Globalists, who are a very, very small fucking cabal of Jewish Bankers who own all the big banks, and they have 1000 times more wealth, which they STOLE from We The People, then TRUMP, who turned a loan of 1 million from his father into 10 Billion!!!! Yes, Trump is successful and smart, and Hillary is a fucking lying worn-out/tired-ass old criminal murderer BITCH, precisely the puppet the Central Bankers who are Globalists want. Do you get it YET?</p>

<p>Vote TRUMP who is TRUTH, and TRIUMPH!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s disinfo, I just think he mingles with other magicians from hollyweird. Dunno if that means he fucks kids like the others but at this point it wouldn&#39;t surprise me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link and some discussion, yes these elements are all throughout his work. I haven&#39;t watched much of his early films, but I&#39;d say its possible that being around those people got him exposed to these ideas and concepts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely weird that he&#39;s just able to bust everyone&#39;s story. Hawking, musk, manson, chomsky, lennon, trump etc etc.</p>

<p>I think he&#39;s on point a lot of the time, but I dunno, I try not to believe anone absolutely these days. He mentions in his tate-manson one and a recent one about some academy award winning films that he thinks the pedo and ritualistic child abuse stuff is all just a psyop. Dunno about that, but it would be pretty interesting if tptb put out all the pedo stuff as disinfo to make us more afraid but none of it actualy happened. I think he&#39;s probably gate keeping there thoigh because some of the victims I&#39;ve heard come forward seem legitimate and sincere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I approach everything very skeptically. Funny how disinfo works, most people have never heard of these concepts and here we are thinking we know the answers, only to consider it was a purposefully laid false answer.

<p>I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m talking about re the technical side of pdfs but a lot of people are sketchy on them and I remember reading that they can have things embedded in them which can be tracked or infect. Don&#39;t quote me there, was just tossing it out as an example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he said based on Spotlight that he now suspects the Catholic church pedophile scandal is likely manufactured (based on all the other Oscar-winning movies based on manufactured events and people). But I don&#39;t think he has weighed in on ritualistic child abuse (though he seems to believe the Satanic cults are just a cover for intelligence). I&#39;m not sure I agree with him on all these points, but I agree it&#39;s interesting to think about whether we&#39;ve been completely mislead on all of that. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who to trust, but I&#39;m like 99% sure Miles is not disinfo. One of the reasons for that is that he takes you through his process of discover, and also you can see how his research progresses over time. And his science site is mind-blowing. I think he&#39;s a bona fide genius, and that&#39;s why he has been able to penetrate through the Matrix so deeply. But then again, he published my paper on Gandhi, so I would say that, wouldn&#39;t I?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doc comes from Miles Mathis&#39;s art and conspiracy website: <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html">http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html</a></p>

<p>I recommend reading his papers in the order in which he wrote them. For the conspiracy stuff, you can probably start with his paper from October 18, 2013, &quot;From Theosophy to the Beat Generation.&quot; (Or maybe a few months earlier with &quot;The Real Matrix.&quot;) </p>

<p>He makes a lot of claims and draws conclusions in his later papers that will seem completely off the wall if you aren&#39;t familiar with his previous research. For example, although he hasn&#39;t done any specific research about David Lynch, his suspicion is based on other conclusions he has reached about famous people and Intelligence psy ops based on other research. You probably won&#39;t agree with him about everything, but he&#39;s well worth reading.  </p>

<p>His science website is also very eye-opening: <a href="http://milesmathis.com">http://milesmathis.com</a></p>

After the election these republican may have made a small show, but have allowed Obama to get everything he wanted. Essentially relinquishing the congressional power to the executive branch. </p>

<p>So the republicans you want to blame for everything did nothing other than grant Obama everything he wanted. Literally nothing else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it was all republican&#39;s fault. I&#39;m pointing out that the author failed to place ANY blame on republicans. The author of this post went all the way back to 1913. Since then, some republicans have been president. Since 1913 The GOP has controlled both the house and senate like 30 times. So yeah, they are just as complicit. Oh how quickly this conversation trailed off to the old &quot;lets blame obama for everything&quot; sob story. </p>

<p>Controlling currency allows control of the nation. If you cut off the head of the snake, all the minions will scamper away when the bribe money stops flowing.</p>

<p>Trump is not a Republican loyalist. The Republican establishment tried every dirty trick in the book to stop him.  He just ran on a republican ticket. Trump is an outsider to the establishment agenda to dismantle America,.. at least we hope.  There is no other choice anyways. </p>

<p>The currency is ready to collapse.  He will be forced to do something.  All Trump has to do is not be part of the establishment agenda. Nothing else matters. The establishment agenda is to systematically dismantle America in every way so they can create their new technocratic totalitarian system. Part of that agenda involves purposely collapsing the ponzie scheme currency in a controlled manner to expertly roll out there next currency scam that will be a cashless system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing that has kept the currency going this long is they keep pumping up the bubbles and manipulating/lying about every economic statistic. </p>

<p>Cashless has been pitched for a while. You can google it. It will be the same as owning non-physical gold vs physical gold. Your life will completely be dependent on the company that controls the card/chip. If they figure out a way to fully control bitcoin they may use it. </p>

<p>You have no clue as to why there was a surge in republicans being voted into congress giving them a majority and what promises they made that got them the votes....  There is no use in trying to explain any of this history to you because it would conflict with the media narrative that you know..</p>
