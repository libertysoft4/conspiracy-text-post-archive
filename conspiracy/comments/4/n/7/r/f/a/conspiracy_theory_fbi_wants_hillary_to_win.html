<p>Hillary has 12 FBI agents investigating her right now.</p>

<p>How many does Trump have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is plausible. Why?</p>

<p>Think back to J Edgar Hoover&#39;s time at the FBI. He had the dirt on anyone who was anybody in politics. This was a big part of why he was director of the Bureau of Investigation from 1924 (renamed Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935) until his death in 1972.</p>

<p>Most people retire from their job at some point, This is especially so with government jobs. Yet, just like an African dictator, Hoover had the job for life.</p>

<p>Most people today accept that Hoover was able to remain as director because no politician dared to try and have him removed. I&#39;m going to argue that Hoover didn&#39;t do anything that anybody in politics hadn&#39;t already done. He was just able to do it better, more comprehensively because of the surveillance and record keeping resources that were available to him.</p>

<p>If Hoover could do this back then, why couldn&#39;t the FBI do the same thing today? When you rise to a certain level, everyone has to be a politician. That definitely includes the top people at the FBI. All it would take is for two or three of them do agree that keeping a few of Hillary&#39;s dirty secrets in their back pocket might be worth a lot more than doing things by the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nailed it. The FBI under Hoover was a blackmail operation and it has always been a blackmail operation. After Hoover, restrictions were imposed on the FBI that a director couldn&#39;t have a term of more than ten years--to prevent the FBI from having too much control and basically too much potential for blackmail--because an FBI director whose been in office for that long can wield some serious power and knows where &quot;all the bodies are buried.&quot;</p>

<p>This term limit restriction was exceeded by Robert Mueller, III who became director 3 months before 9/11 and was director for 12 years before being replaced by former HSBC director James Comey. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was referring to the sanders love affair this sub has. I think u/sheasie nailed it.</p>

<p>To your point... To blackmail, one must live in the black. There&#39;s simply too much light from the internet to pull it off these days. Imagine everyone in the fbi office knowing their boss is a shady character. Awkward! That said, you nailed the history and I think the cia is still up to no good. But the shady days are ever coming to a close. Everyone knows everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blackmail is impossible because of the internet?  I&#39;m think the threat of CP planted on your computer is still pretty potent.</p>

<p>And if the internet was a perfect cure for blackmail and corruption because eveyone would know what their boss is up to...what if the subordinates enjoy what their boss is up too?   The internet helps, but it&#39;s no magic bullet.  Just look at half the police forces.</p>
