    <div class="md"><p>The difficulty is that, under pressure, it is hard to extract reliable information from people who were there because memory does not work like a VCR. It&#39;s impossible for someone to remember facts without remembering a narrative. The narrative is either constructed while facts happen, or added after the fact from other details, reflection, tainting by hearing accounts of others who were there.</p>

<p>If we had unbiased investigators, all they would do is collect all the narratives from all people present, filter out the obvious accounts that are mistaken, and synthesize a reconstructed narrative.</p>

<p>Of course the problem is when the official story line, supposedly gathered from &quot;facts&quot; (as in, eyewitnesses, video recording from people and/or CCTV) is not backed up by what is shown and said on TV.</p>

<p>In this case? I have no clue.</p>

<p>If you actually have a bunch of people who were there saying &quot;There was more than one shooter, some were holding doors closed&quot; but the official story is &quot;There was only one guy.&quot; it feels a little fishy.</p>

<p>Also the speed at which the authorities are releasing that information is a little fishy. The while thing took hours to unravel, and there were a lot of survivors/subjects to interview, lots of facts to gather. But about 24 hours later it&#39;s all &quot;Yep, just that one guy. He&#39;s dead now. Case closed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sure everyone will think im a shill, but i actually knew one of the people killed: Paul Henry. We used to work together at orange lake at their inbound call center. He was a real person, and now he is dead. This isnt some kind of faked incident with actors, one of my friends is no longer alive, and it is very real.  Look through my post history, im usually on board with some of these conspiracy theories, but this incident hit close to home and I know for a fact it actually happened. </p>

<p>Not sure what i can offer as proof, but i guarantee if you dig enough you will realize this incident was real, because it actually is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why people say events like this are 100% fake or 100% how the media says it happened. Say, Sandy Hook. Did those children die? Some people say yes, Lanza killed them, or no, the whole thing never happened. I say that it&#39;s totally possible that the government killed the children.</p>

<p>Same goes for this event. Without really doing any research, I believe you that you know someone involved, but it could be possible that this Omar guy was not the only shooter, or he may have been under government mind control, or just a patsy. Or if he was a genuine self-radicalized Islamist, then <strong>obviously</strong> he was under mind control in that sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. Im familiar with scopolamine, and i firmly believe that many of these shootings and tragedies did not go down like the media says it did. I just know that one of the first reactions in the conspiracy world is that it is all an act and the whole thing is staged. Since i have first hand info i thought it would be beneficial to clear up some misconceptions.  </p>

<p>Personally i believe there were multiple shooters, and i believe that we aren&#39;t getting the whole story. I just wanted people on here to at least know the victims are real, even if some of the other info isnt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An ar15 is capable of firing 800 rounds per minute. Factor in that an ar15 is only able to fire as fast as the shooter can pull the trigger, and a soft estimate could be 2 rounds per second. Now, factor in that a normal magazine holds 30 rounds (subtract 2 so that the spring doesn&#39;t jam and you have 28 rounds per clip). So every 14 seconds add another 5 seconds for magazine change (another soft estimate). 4 magazines of 28 rounds would take approximately 71 seconds or 1 minute 11 seconds. And thats assuming that the shooter has slow, non practiced actions. So in a little over a minute its simple to fire off 112 rounds. Enough to do the damage that happened with some leftover stray bullets. If that doesnt suit you, double the time for twice the bullets and claim that &gt;100 shots went into the wall. </p>

<p>So, yes i do know how long it would take to shoot and kill 50 people. Less time than it takes to brush your teeth in the morning. </p>

<p>And no, the shooter would not have been mobbed. I dont know where you came up with the idea that people run toward a weapon being fired, but this does not happen. </p>

<p>Im not casting doubt that this was a &quot;scenario&quot;. Im just telling you that your thought process to come to that conclusion is seriously flawed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About 2 minutes.  But there were also about 50 people injured.  So let&#39;s say that makes 4-5 minutes of shooting and anyone running <em>towards</em> you gets your full attention.</p>

<p>Two seconds is enough time for a practiced, but non-professional individual to acquire a new target and place a lethal shot.  The Texas CHL qualification test uses this as a general guideline, and almost everyone passes that test after minimal training.  And that&#39;s with a handgun at various indoor distances.  A semi-automatic rifle will only increase accuracy, magazine capacity, and reduce recoil, making it easier to place multiple shots per target in the same period of time.</p>

<p>This is entirely plausible, with either a handgun or a rifle.</p>

<p>However, it is also <em>very</em> probable that no one tried to stop the shooter because they were too fucking busy trying to get away or hide from the shooter. Plus, it was dark, loud music was playing, people are shouting to be heard over the loud music, many were probably drunk, some have said they thought the first few popping sounds were from someone setting off firecrackers. People were confused, scared, and just wanted to get away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not yet willing to dismiss the possibility of a second party being involved. I&#39;m thinking he was carrying extra magazines, already loaded, and that many of the injuries are the result of people panicking &amp; trampling each other trying to get out. We must remember that this was a large amount of drunk people, in a relatively small, loud space. </p>

<p>My question concerns the club&#39;s security practices- what is their bouncer situation on an average weekend? I have never been to a club that did not have bouncers &amp; actual cops hired for the weekend crowds. I obviously don&#39;t know if this is typical, so Redditors, are there cops working security at the clubs you&#39;ve been to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t disagreeing, just providing what my theory is in regards to the high number of injuries. though never having been in a similar situation, I am pretty certain I&#39;d unthinkingly trample a stranger when in full on flight mode.</p>

<p>I agree, everyone has a camera in their pocket, you&#39;d expect someone to have filmed something.  That said, I have never once recorded anything in a club, besides posing for a pic or two, &amp; if it were me- I probably would have hauled ass outta there, not stop to record it. </p>

<p>It don&#39;t believe that the club, or surrounding businesses, wouldn&#39;t have security cameras, but perhaps they are not releasing footage because of the ongoing investigation?</p>

<p>Obviously I have no video to provide, but as my comment suggests, I do have questions regarding the security, both of Pulse &amp; dance clubs in general. This seemed as reasonable a place to ask the question as anywhere.</p>
