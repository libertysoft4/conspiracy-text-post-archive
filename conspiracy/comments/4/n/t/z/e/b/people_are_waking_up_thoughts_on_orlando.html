<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re saying TPTB want to make guns illegal just like drugs? Sure, although there are different agendas at work there. They want to make both illegal but for different reasons. Also, many people in power have no problem killing others in order to promote their own agenda and self-interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The odds of it happening in &quot;real life&quot; were pretty fucking high when crazy people can access high powered assault rifles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think this? Is it because you&#39;ve seen so many people shooting up public places in the past few years? What if I told you the majority of them were pretty much made up - broadcast into the media to make you think there are a lot of crazy people with rifles running around?</p>

<p>In your own &quot;real life&quot; (NOT ON TV), how many crazy people with rifles have you encountered?</p>

<p>Also the high amount of tragedy that you seem to encounter has no bearing on whether or not a government would choose to kill or terrorize its own people. If anything, government agendas <em>might</em> be the reason for all your pain.</p>

<p>Wow. You&#39;re really going off the rails now. You gotta pull your trolling/shilling together, man, or I&#39;m going to lose intellectual interest. Your comments have to actually reflect and antagonize what I&#39;m saying. You can&#39;t just grab something that <em>you mentioned</em> and use that as argumentative fulcrum. Maybe I don&#39;t care about that point. Maybe I even like the point you made. The point is, you&#39;ve got to select your attack points. Look for things that the person cares about. Look for things that might make them angry or emotional. That way, your opponent loses intellectual function. And that should be one of your main goals. Your job as a troll/shill is to make people stop thinking, because when they stop thinking, they&#39;re more easily influence by emotional appeals. At the very least, try to make them angry. </p>

<p>So far, you&#39;ve haven&#39;t been so well because it&#39;s too obvious what you&#39;re doing. But let&#39;s keep trying, OK?</p>

<p>Anyway, about your &quot;narrow&quot; point.  I&#39;m pretty sure the government has at minimum at least <em>three</em> agendas (not just two) running at any given time. Heck, my personal life is more complex than that. And I&#39;m pretty boring.</p>

<p>Now as far as your arguments go, I&#39;m not seeing any arguments to undermine. Last comment you asked me a question, and I  answered it. If you don&#39;t believe me, ask me another question or present another argument (hopefully on topic). I&#39;ll answer it directly.</p>
