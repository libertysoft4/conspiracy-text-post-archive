        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve personally been thinking about leaving the U.S. I won&#39;t bother to go into details about why, suffice to say the general air from the news, politics and TV programs seems to be relaying a general message that white males are no longer wanted. (I even read that most woman in the U.S. don&#39;t want to have male babies anymore and suffer gender disappointment when they do.) To be clear, I am not racist, sexist or have any such prejudices. It just feels like things are starting to move too far to an opposite extreme. Equality isn&#39;t enough, and the white male is the inevitable target. Maybe I am reading too much into it. I know at the very least I am jumping the gun a bit. But if it keeps up, I could imagine something like China&#39;s Red Guard taking shape here. And I don&#39;t want to be around for anything like that!</p>

<p>So if I am <em>starting</em> to feel this way. I was wondering if others are too? And if so, do you think it is a planned thing by media and elitists? Do you think they realize they might be pushing things too far?* I even wonder if the constant shooting of black men by police is a plan to further this agenda.</p>

<p>(* It may seem stupid, but when they made Jimmy Olsen a big handsome black guy just so Supergirl could fall for him... well, one can&#39;t help but wonder.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something I&#39;ve never gotten a chance to ask any of you white/black/brown/green supremacists:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that they were trying to mix all the races together into one race.  What happens when the &#39;white man&#39; is gone?  What negative things will happen?  Replace white with any color and I still ask the same question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m mixed myself with white, black, pacific islander, and more.  People call me a mutt.  And you know what&#39;s funny?  At first glance, white people call me hispanic, middle eastern, or asian.  Black people call me a tan white dude.  Asians are the only group that can look at me and actually accept me as part of their &#39;race&#39;.  Not that I fucking care anyway, because why the fuck does it matter?</p>

<p>You know what the greatest part about being mixed is?  Possessing the ability to not judge people based on their skin tone AKA A GENETIC FUCKING ACCIDENT.  It blows my mind people can automatically hate someone for basically just being.  That&#39;s it.  Is it their fault they&#39;re whatever color they are?  Fuck no.  Just like you, they were born, and one day realized their color.  But they had no control over it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like George Carlin says, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;re proud to have a genetic predisposition to colon cancer, would you?&quot;  Same principle.</p>

<p>At the same time that being mixed beyond belief allows me to ignore any social prejudices against any groups of people, it also exposes me to MUCH racism.  I&#39;ve heard racism come from every group and about every group.  And it&#39;s sad.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always found the racism things so <em>very</em> strange really.  There are quite a few in this sub (and who have popped in this very thread) that persist in that ignorant mentality.  I just find it pretty darn crazy and pretty self-defeating actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB are in the business of making sure and keeping the dumb masses (i.e. <em>us</em>) separated and at each others throats - racially, ethnically, financially, etc, etc - constantly.  Together we stand, divided we fall.  They know this, and they make sure and constantly keep us very divided and conflicted using every kind of social and MSM tool they possibly can.</p>

<p>Blame can definitely be thrown around as to what race it is that&#39;s caused the most damage, who&#39;s mostly at fault, etc, etc, but at the end of the day, EVERY single race - white, black, Asian, Aboriginal, etc - has caused damage to others and has perpetuated the ignorance that keeps the species perpetually antagonistic toward itself and entirely shackled and enslaved by those hidden powers above that covertly perpetuate that antagonism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a white thing, or a black thing, or an any race thing.  It&#39;s species-based, and so long as we continue to go along with any type of separatist propaganda, we as a human species on this planet will continue to suffer for our ignorance and remained ruled over, enslaved, and taken advantage of.</p>

<p>There&#39;s quite a bit of evidence strongly suggesting that you might be a lot closer to the truth than you might think.  <a href="http://whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">This pdf</a> goes through a <em>lot</em>.</p>

I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s more sad and frustrating:  That it gets spoon fed to the masses by the MSM and TPTB, or that so many people are actually so ignorant that they buy into that negativity and perpetuated it.

    <div class="md"><p>Complete and utter bullshit.</p>

<p>The problem with this idea is that it only works for two genetically depressed populations that have been inbred for longer than their genetic code will allow. For example, among ornamental plants that have been artificially selected for a certain type of petal without regard to other vital traits that affect health, growth, and reproduction. The resulting “vigor” of the progeny of the hybrid is really just a return to an acceptable standard of functional genetic fitness.</p>

<p>The hybrid most likely inherent at least one working copy of genes that code for functional proteins, whereas in the genetically depressed parent genome, both copies may have produced broken non-functional or semi-functional products.</p>

<p>The notion that hybridization results in heterosis for humans is highly unlikely, especially when taking into account the fact there is greater genetic variation within any given population compared to the number of alleles for any given locus. There is a surprisingly low number of genes in an individual human’s genome (20,000-25,000) and therefore any difference resulting from population hybridization would have negligible results for hybrid vigor. Not to mention both hybrid vigor hypotheses involve inbred parental populations, making the assumptions for human heterosis further disproved. And the benefits diminish from the F1 generation onwards, so to continue producing human hybrid offspring with these hypothetical results requires the divergent populations to remain intact, just as with any other species.</p>

<p>Also, the assumption that an admixed human, subpopulation-wise, is entirely heterozygous is utterly wrong. Let’s look at a contradictory case: you have two parents from different populations with pairs of identical homozygous alleles for eye color. Draw the Punnett square if necessary; the offspring will be homozygotes with respect to eye color. There are many more example of these cases beyond just eye color.</p>

<p>Such as immunity, the fact is admixing in humans does not equate to more functional immune systems in terms of HLA diversity. There are admixed individuals with a very limited set of these allotypes and non-admixed individuals who have many up to the maximum number as there are only so many available loci per genome. Consider HL A1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 which limited to a maximum of 2 in any given person. For example, a person could have A1, A2, A7, A8 but not A1, A2, A3, and A11 or A7, A8, A14, A15. Because each human population already has more HLA variants than the limit of loci per individual, it’s better to pass on the alleles that confer resistance to regional pathogens which offspring will be more likely to encounter than foreign alleles from foreign populations. Currently HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1, have roughly 1000, 1600, and 870 known alleles, respectively.</p>

<p>The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that multiracial kids are not subject to hybrid vigor any more than monoracial kids.</p>
