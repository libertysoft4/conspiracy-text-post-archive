It&#39;s possible that Bernie supports this move, as he is very adamant that none of his supporters vote for Trump. Having Warren as VP will attract the Bernie supporters and keep his message alive at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I actually read it and damn that sucks. I didn&#39;t know they were still so associated, although it&#39;s funny the article spent most of it&#39;s time saying how &quot;Paul libertarianism is not Koch libertarianism&quot; and how they&#39;re using paul like bait to get people hooked on libertarianism, and then picking out of that crowd to move people more right-libertarian, which is what they actually want. </p>

<p>Sucks. I&#39;ve lost faith in all politicians except Elizabeth Warren, and she just endorsed Hillary so I don&#39;t even know anymore. I think elections should be of random people drawn from the population, not these moneyed well-connected politicians</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. It really is mind-blowing how deeply entrenched our political system is in big money when you look in to it. Do you think corporations run the government almost entirely for their benefit? Government has done some good things for the people in the past, protecting them from corporations... but this modern government is entirely bought-and-sold and corporations have gotten so good at playing the game of legislation, lobbying, lawyers and so on. It pays to do so, and has become a mainstream tactic for the big players. </p>

<p>Is it <em>always</em> like that,  or is this a particularly bad period? How can we recover from this? It&#39;s hard to get anyone the power to change the law for the better of the people without first having to go through a screening process that is owned by big money. </p>

<p>I think we need to start looking at peaceful revolution in a manner like this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Icelandic_financial_crisis_protests">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Icelandic_financial_crisis_protests</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in the late 60s early 70s this is by far the worst the corporate control has been at least in public. There has always been this if you look into the original titans, Rockefeller, Vanderbuilt, etc. but now there doesn&#39;t seem to be any hiding it anymore and worse there are way fewer people fighting for our rights. When I grew up the middle class was strong and college was free, that contributed to the housing boom. Now it is blatant and anybody who actually tries to help the common man gets treated like Sanders and called a communist.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s the thing I hear over and over. I know it wasn&#39;t a great time, but at least people had optimism and a feeling things were moving in a better direction, and they generally were! Now it&#39;s just exhausting and depressing, in a lot of ways... Feels like we&#39;re stuck in a rut for 3 decades while corporations buy out our government more and more, and few people have any ideas of how to fix it. I think we need a revolution like the nonviolent icelandic pots and pans revolution of 2009: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Icelandic_financial_crisis_protests">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Icelandic_financial_crisis_protests</a></p>

<p>I feel like I should probably start making plans to leave the country sometime in the next decade or two, regardless of who wins the next elections. That is unless the FBI actually follows through and Hillary is out of the race and Sanders is the nominee, but I highly doubt that because she&#39;s buddy-buddy with the FBI it seems.

<p>I hold all my politicians to the same standard I dont give one passes on one thing while being critical of somebody else for doing something the other gets a pass on.</p>

<p>If you want somebody who is all the way honest and you say thats why you cant jive with warren you should not by no means be able to jive with trump. If you do it makes you a hypocrite.</p>

<p>She could endorse a third party Bernie run. But she’s too cowardly to do that. She’s a heroine?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And if she actually cared about him ever, for any reason, she wouldn’t have done this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It’s not impossible. Clinton doesn’t have the required number of regular delegates. They could still swing Bernie at the convention. They won’t, of course, but they absolutely COULD, which is the point. Had she and hundreds of other high profile democrats supported him, Sandernistas would have still had a chance. But she didn’t, because she hates him and never supported him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>she decided to do some good... ...by running alongside hilary clinton.</p>

<p>This is a joke, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She’s uniting with clinton for the sake of going up against trump who is for whatever reason loved in this sub reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because he’s not a foreigner and not a traitor. Those are our only other options. Because his platform is ‘enforcing the constitution’ and everyone else’s is ‘raping everything on which this country was founded and killing anyone who doesn’t like it’. This is not an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Maybe educate yourself on the country in which you live sometime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think she’s a sell out not warren</p>

<p>She literally just sold out. Open your fucking eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You told me I need to educate myself on the country in which I live. I was almost able to take you seriously until you spoke highly of trump. A man is not to be judged on his 5-6 months worth of talking when his 69 years of life shows more then 6 months of lip service ever could.</p>

<p>He has enriched himself of scamming other people out of money and stiffing multiple lenders all to enrich himself. He claimed to care about veterans yet only donated to them come time for election while supposedly being worth 10 billion dollars. Prior to that he made a donation of 50,000 dollars YEARS ago for a tax break. Your worth 10 billion dollars? and claim veterans are everything etc yet now that your running for president you want to donate millions to the veterans?</p>

<p>Are people bought and manipulated that easily? veterans are used to allowing themselves to be pimped by government officials who dont give a damn about them so the ease of manipulating them did not suprise me by much. Pandering and pretending to care about veterans is an easy tactic used by people to garner supporters. They support you in public but talk about what dumb simple minded barbarian slaves they are behind closed doors.</p>

<p>I am supposed to disregard this mans 69 years of life and believe that even though he has focused soeley on enriching himself that now he has had a moral epiphany and is doing what hes doing because hes a patriot and for the good of the country?</p>

<p>Your either very desperate or foolish. I cant take anybody who supports donald trump seriously in any capacity. I might have taken your post seriously until you spoke highly of trump.</p>

<p>It is you who needs to open your fucking eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;look at my african american over there&quot; lets go back to the &quot;good old days&quot; aka days where life was good for straight white males and bad for everyone else.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as &quot;the good old days&quot; because the good old days were always bad days for somebody else in this country be it the natives who had there lands pillaged from them women who had no rights or blacks who were enslaved or gays who were lynched.</p>

<p>America has NEVER had a &quot;good old days&quot; we are working twoards that but we cannot go back to something we have never had. On a really good day nearly everyone should be able to smile not just a few of us that is what would be a good day.</p>

<p>If you support and you believe in donald trump as a vision of the future you are a fool. &quot;hes a patriot&quot; give me a fucking break being a &quot;patriot&quot; is slave mentality.</p>

<p>Patriotism and nationalism is for dim witted fools and it will limit your minds potential. You keep voiting for donald trump though. </p>

<p>This whole country is built on lies deciet theivery rape and murder so who better fit to lead a country with such a foundation other than a man who embodies those very things himself unapologetically.</p>

<p>Maybe he is fit to lead this country and maybe its time for me to leave it. You do and believe what you want as will I. A &quot;patriot&quot; lol how childish.</p>

<p>Dont worry trump makes lots of people realize how disgusting the people who inhabit this country are the fact that a man such as himself has garnished such an outlandish amout of supporters shows just how disgusting the culture adopted by the citizens of this country are. Dont worry if elected his presence may disgust people so much they will leave and then your &quot;good ol days&quot; can come right on back.</p>

<p>You open your fucking eyes apply some damn critical thinking and see it for what it is before you come at me with that &quot;patriotic bullshit tripe&quot;.</p>

<p>Also downvotes are cute but the truth is sexy i prefer the truth. A downvote is an escape from a responce because there is nothing to be said only what can be seen and that is trump is not a patriot and he is not a vision of the future and if you think he is you are a misinformed fool and there is no nice way to put it.</p>

<p>I use to ask myself how people like hitler rose to power and manipulated the hearts of so many. Then i look at how truly fucking stupid easily manipulated and brainwashed some people are who are so lazy that they would listen to a man run his mouth for a couple months vs examining the mans 69 years of living life on the planet.</p>

<p>That will tell you more about who somebody is and what their intentions are than them running their mouth for a couple of months. Pathetic I think anybody who supports or believes in donald trump is just a sorry pathetic lost soul.</p>

<p>The amount of people who believe in this man has made me loose faith in this country absolutley disgusting I will never forget this election never have I been so sick in my stomach for such a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I trust people with poor grammar. I know a guy who cant read or write a paragraph and yet he can buikd computers from scrap parts and im pretty sure he makes more money than you do.</p>

<p>Literacy is not a measurment of intellect or trustworthyness it is a learned skill. Its not something that pays my bills or provides for me in life and im not a writer or a journalist so i honestly care very little about it.</p>

<p>Secondly typing on a phone that auto corrects and misinterperets button pushes is exhuasting and i dont feel the need to correct it.</p>

<p>The funny thing is I got an a plus in A.P english and an A plus in every single literary based course for all the english classes I have attended in the united states. </p>

<p>What does that say about how our education system is for that manner.</p>

<p>I know how to format and all that jazz i did recieve a 1000 dollar scholarship for an essay contest. I just dont feel the need to go out of my way when I make a comment.</p>

<p>Im not formatting a resume nor am I submitting a term paper I am having dialog on reddit if people wish to believe im an idiot or that I am not trustworthy because of poor grammer it most certainly is their right though.</p>

<p>I should ask my friend who cant spell or write in any capacity if he feels people like you are idiots because you cant do complex equations and calculus in your head in 5 second incriments regardless of how long the equation is. Or if he thinks your an idiot because you cannot build a computer from scrap haha you grammar nazis are just so cute.</p>

<p>For example in the first sentance i typed i spelled build incorrectly because my finger accidently hit a different key. You think im going to go all the way back and correct that just to satisfy you? lol get over yourself. Im not competing for a grade a promotion or your approval of my grammar. :)</p>

<p>The point of literacy to me is being able to communicate through means other than vocal conversation. If people could not understand what I try to communicate I would have very little karma because very little people would be able to understand the message im trying to convey. </p>

<p>The people I care to communicate with understand my writing if you dont understand it your probably not somebody i was attempting to send my communication 2. Again please have a sip of some &quot;get over yourself capachino&quot;.</p>

<p>I hear it taste pretty good after you take the stick out.</p>

<p>Now excuse me I have some ill formatted mispelled walls of text to go compile. So funny my first college essay for english 101 was a paper I wrote about why there is no such thing as the &quot;proper&quot; way to write. My professor was so impressed with it she said she would keep it and I went back to her class a year later and she still had it.</p>

<p>So obviously my communications or lack thereof do exactly what I intend for them to do. If you dont like it nobody is making you read it just saying.</p>

<p>A man is not to be judged on his 5-6 months worth of talking</p>

<p>You mean 30 years.</p>

<p>He claimed to care about veterans yet only donated to them come time for election</p>

<p>Your point is what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am supposed to disregard this mans 69 years of life</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>He’s 70 now.</li>
<li>No, you’re supposed to actually look at it, since you haven’t, and see that he has been consistent.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>he has focused solely on enriching himself that now he...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...is giving back to the country in which he always believed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your either very desperate or foolish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says the man with no citations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can’t take anybody who supports donald trump seriously in any capacity.</p>

<p>I can’t take anyone who has no proof of his claims seriously in any capacity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is you who needs to open your fucking eyes.</p>

<p>Open. Your. Fucking. Eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”look at my african american over there&quot;</p>

<p>I would have preferred he said, “fine American negro”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lets go back to the “good old days” aka days where life was good for straight white males and bad for everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t have an argument. All you have is bullshit historical revisionism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as “the good old days&quot; because the good old days were always bad days for somebody else</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds great until you realize it means absolutely nothing in any capacity whatsoever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in this country be it the natives who had there lands pillaged from them</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>The American settlers built on unowned land.</li>
<li>Indios had no concept of land ownership.</li>
<li>Indios fought and lost their second encounter with Europeans, who they beat the first time.</li>
<li>If you don’t like it, give your land back to them and shut the fuck up.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>women who had no rights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know absolutely nothing whatsoever about history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or blacks who were enslaved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As opposed to now, where literally every human being on Earth is enslaved. Oh, never mind that blacks enslaved whites. But that doesn’t fit your shitposting narrative, so it’s omitted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gays who were lynched.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And? The only thing I’d change about that is getting them psychiatric help first.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America has NEVER had a “good old days&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, we did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we cannot go back to something we have never had.</p>

<p>Good thing we had it, then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a really good day nearly everyone should be able to smile not just a few of us that is what would be a good day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Utilitarianism is complete bullshit. If you actually believed in it, you would kill yourself and donate your organs to the needy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you support and you believe in donald trump as a vision of the future you are a fool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[citation needed]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>being a “patriot&quot; is slave mentality.</p>

<p>LOL, but being a globalist isn’t. Good job there, marxist.</p>

<p>Patriotism and nationalism is for dim witted fools and it will limit your minds potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL SO ENLIGHTENED LOL</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This whole country is built on lies deceit theivery rape and murder</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fucking tip your fedora elsewhere. The time of your bullshit historical revisionism is over, and <strong><em>woe unto you</em></strong> on the day we come calling in vengeance for the rape and genocide of all our good works and the bastardization of our legacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do and believe what you want as will I.</p>

<p>My only regret for you is that when you’re put up against the wall and shot, you won’t even know WHY it happened to you.</p>
