    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand how bad we are brainwashed here in the US, and that most people don&#39;t even realize it.  It&#39;s not their fault.  We are indoctrinated from the time we begin school to stand and pledge allegiance to the greatest country that ever existed.  We are taught all through school that we have the most freedom of any country on earth.  Our education model is that of pre-WWI Germany&#39;s state run thought control, which was brought here by the Nazis in Operation Paperclip; true history is not instructed.  Our &quot;news&quot; sources only run stories of distraction, division, and misdirection while we are force-fed meaningless celebrity gossip;  all thanks to Operation Mockingbird, CoIntelPro, etc.  We are continually pitted against one another over which party is the most patriotic.  Anyone who disagrees or thinks critically against an official government report is labeled a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and ridiculed in accordance with CIA Document #1035-960.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Research the Socratic method. It may be the only way to reach people. Otherwise, people&#39;s opinions and ideas are so entrenched in their personalities that when you criticize their thoughts, they take it as an attack on their ego, and thus themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>This is so crucial and is at the root of all problems: a conflation of ego with thought and emotion. People just don&#39;t get that their thoughts and emotions aren&#39;t &quot;who they are&quot; and that they&#39;re just transient experiences. We&#39;ve been split, mind against mind, emotion against emotion. The game and goal is division and confusion with a heavy emphasis on confusion. I&#39;m definitely looking up the Socratic method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in relation to that, the most powerful thing you can do is to actively and regularly meditate. It&#39;s literally the practice of learning to hold your attention while observing the swirling miasma that is the &quot;monkey mind&quot; as an objective non- judging and non-rejecting observer. It really and genuinely is a skill that takes <em>consistent</em> practice. Even 10 minutes a day for a while to start is great. And this skill will prove profoundly positive. A real eye opener! The benefits are technically the practice itself since one meditates as a human for the same reason birds sing. Having said that, the &quot;benefits&quot; are fairly well documented and fascinating in and of themselves not least of which is a less jumpy state of mind through which life is lived and not just traveled through reflexively. I highly recommend checking out the talks and books of Alan Watts (not Watt). His talks are legendary and his style is direct and even in a talk that is outwardly about, say, Hinduism, the thread of insight, perspective and wisdom he throws your way really does make you feel like he &quot;gets it&quot; like no one else I&#39;ve heard or read. There&#39;s a lot of his talks on YouTube of varying quality but most have a backdrop of music which i personally prefer without which are also available. You can find torrents of collection of his talks also which are in their original format. There is indeed much more to this world than meets the eye, and it begins with the interconnectedness of everything and how it all interacts in the interplay of opposites; light/dark, good/bad, hot/cold, front/back, etc. Good luck investigating. I wish you all the best and if you have any questions about anything feel free to ask away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the awesome reply. I&#39;ve been looking into it for the last hour and I think something like Mindfulness will be best for me, as it&#39;s possible to do in action. I think it&#39;ll be harder for me to find time to sit down and meditate so for now, I like how there&#39;s something I can do no matter what else I&#39;m doing :).</p>

<p>A couple of replies I got said that by doing this regularly, by observing the mind and not getting involved in it (so I assume this means we&#39;re breaking our identification with the mind), that this leads to liberating insights and higher vibrations etc. Do you know how this works? I read something earlier about how we&#39;re always ignoring the peace and happiness that&#39;s always here by identifying with the mind, so I&#39;m assuming that once we break that identification, we see reality for what it truly is? Or something.. :\</p>

<p>How has your own progression been with meditation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey just wanted to chime in here with this:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX1IFUDNtto">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX1IFUDNtto</a></p>

<p>I was introduced to mindfulness and meditation scientifically a few years ago but had such horrible anxiety that I could never put any of it into practice. I watched this video about 6 months ago and started thinking about some of the things he says randomly throughout the day (e.g. &quot;when am I?&quot;) and the answers kept getting deeper. After a few weeks, with what seemed like very little effort, I was able to get into really deep meditation and reach those &quot;liberating insights&quot;.. I can&#39;t even begin to describe how powerful it is and how it feels.</p>

<p>The video explains pretty well how this works on a standard scientific level i.e. the whole spiel with the default mode network. You could look into the DMN and find some pretty decent research being done on the effects of meditation on the brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched this and really wanted to thank you for sharing. It is absolutely fascinating. I too also struggle with a lot of resistance, anxiety and blah blah blah blah (lol) so it really was a great watch. </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused in terms of how to put it into practice though. You said you&#39;d randomly start asking yourself that question (&quot;When am I?&quot;) and the answers got deeper over time, but none of the questions he gives as examples make any sense to me. Do you consciously have to think of the answer or just sit back and let it come to you in time?</p>

<p>Also how is your anxiety and general state of mind now? Have you turned off a lot of the blah blah blah and has your life changed as a result?</p>

<p>Again, thanks a lot for the sharing. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking such an interest! I&#39;m excited to help :) in fact, so excited that I&#39;m gonna have to apologize profusely in advance for the long long long reply I&#39;m leaving. I hope my ramblings don&#39;t deter you from learning more haha. Anyway...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I went about it. I began asking myself &quot;when am I?&quot; anytime I had a free moment. I picked this question because it seemed the hardest to just deflect since it was a little bit stranger. Each time I&#39;d ask myself, I would focus my mind enough to make sure it didn&#39;t go off-topic, but let it wander otherwise. Kind of like one of those &quot;there are no dumb answers&quot; brainstorming sessions we had in school sometimes. Everyone just blurt out something. So my brain would just throw out random things, a lot of them literal, some very sarcastic, mostly nonsense. But a couple seemed to merit further thought so I wrote those down and started thinking about them individually. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t remember the other answer candidates but the one that really got me going was looking at &quot;when&quot; my mind was lurking. Think of time as kind of a spatial dimension that your mind can travel through. At random times throughout the day, I&#39;d ask &quot;when am I?&quot; and it&#39;d usually turn into some variant of &quot;am I in the past.. thinking of what happened 10 years ago? 2 years ago? 2 minutes ago? Am I thinking about the future? Am I in 2 years from now? After lunch? Or am I literally just right here, when I&#39;m supposed to be, when my physical being is?&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, I was rarely when I was supposed to be. Imagine time as a room where you&#39;re standing in the center and need &quot;help&quot; doing something, but your damn mind is running around like an excited dog and you can&#39;t get anything done without its cooperation. That&#39;s one of the powers of blah blah blah. Over time, it became clearer and clearer to me that being &quot;anywhen&quot; else is just not gonna work. I can&#39;t have my physical being trying to do one thing and my mind running all over. Not only will I not get anything done, but I&#39;ll never be happy where I am because my mind will always be thinking of that time in the past that was better, or what it can do in the future that could be better, or negative things that happened or could happen that drag me down, no matter where I am or what I&#39;m doing. </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the interesting part. Once this part clicked, it was like I had my foot in the door. My mind had freed up just enough CPU to comprehend the other questions on a deeper level. So then it became &quot;where am I?&quot;, &quot;what am I?&quot;, &quot;where are these thoughts coming from?&quot;. Being able to think about these in depth turns off your DMN and that&#39;s when the real mindfulness starts. At this point, it literally starts to feel like being on psycholytic drugs and you have open access to <em>you</em>. Good stuff :D</p>

<p>Here are a few &quot;meditation-triggering&quot; questions that I posted somewhere else which might help get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li>where do my thoughts come from?</li>
<li>from my head to toe, mind and body, what am I feeling right now?</li>
<li>what physical manifestations do these feelings have?</li>
<li>where am I? - but not the typical answer of address or country.. really what is your place on this planet, solar system, even in your room?</li>
<li>what am I? - as in what really is your nature as a person? Do you feel like you&#39;re your body, your mind, a mixture?</li>
<li>who am I? - what is my narrative and why is it so important to me?</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The above is really the only useful part of this reply. The rest is just me going on about how well this works and the results I&#39;ve gotten, if you need any more motivation :) feel free to jump to the tl;dr!</p>

<p>As for how I&#39;m doing now generally.. it&#39;s kind of overwhelming thinking about it and trying to explain it to someone who doesn&#39;t know me, in a very good way. Altogether, I&#39;d say I had a pretty shitty life - genetics and environment coming together to create a lot of mental issues, a nice huge shitstorm. I&#39;m 22 and I&#39;m dealing with/have dealt with OCD, GAD, Asperger&#39;s, borderline personality disorder, major depression, CSP, eating disorders, sleeping disorders, social anxiety, PTSD, self-harming, suicide attempts, alcoholism, and two horrible concussions (one of which happened in the US so I had zero health care) that made everything so so much worse. Darn comorbidity. And that&#39;s just the medical stuff (and I think I&#39;ve actually forgotten a few things; I&#39;m on cold medicine right now). </p>

<p>A little over a year ago, I had a horrible horrible nervous breakdown and moved away, far far away. I can&#39;t stress how bad I&#39;d gotten. I moved in with a friend and he had to wait on me hand and foot otherwise I wouldn&#39;t eat or do anything; I literally needed a 24/7 nurse and would have ended up in a hospital if not for him. I was an absolute mess just waiting to get drunk enough one night to end it all. And my anxiety was the worst part of it. I can&#39;t stress how bad that was. I spent 2011-2016 in a chronic state of anxiety just teetering on a panic attack. My anxiety in itself was enough to qualify me as a &quot;disabled student&quot; in Canada. My mind was screaming BLAH BLAH BLAH all the time in its angriest metal voice (and not pleasant, like Halford, think death metal) and all I could do was cry and drink myself into a catatonic state just to survive.</p>

<p>Now I know that&#39;s probably a lot more information than you&#39;d asked for, but I feel I had to write it to stress the potential this type of mindfulness and meditation has. So 12 months ago, I was a walking corpse; I spent 3 months just trying to catch my breath since I was finally away from a very very horribly stressful situation; then I spent 3 more months regaining basic functionality (eating, showering, sleeping) so that I didn&#39;t need 24/7 supervision (using self-administered propranolol PTSD treatment and having my friend as amazing support); come January, I moved back in with my mom and no longer had my friend with me all the time, which was incredibly scary, BUT I pushed myself and used these last 6 months for self-exploration using this kind of meditation and that&#39;s when I really started getting better.</p>

<p>I am now one of the calmest, most positive people I know. I feel like a 70&#39;s hippie a lot of the time cause I&#39;m just so at peace with everything around me. My anxiety is completely gone. I&#39;ve stopped drinking. I&#39;m eating the healthiest I ever have and feel great. I&#39;m FINALLY not afraid of sleep (always have been, since age 3 or so) and don&#39;t have anymore nightmares. My depression will always be beside me telling me to get back in bed and be sad, but I barely even hear it anymore. I&#39;ve finally learned emotional regulation. No more self harm and certainly no more suicidal thoughts.. I love life (again, cold medicine probably made me forget a few other things, but you get the point). There&#39;s still a lot wrong, but I&#39;m good with it. I&#39;ll change what I can and accept what I can&#39;t.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m still dealing with a couple things, mainly the social anxiety and PTSD, but those are a direct result of physical brain damage from my second concussion and TBI-related anxiety is very different from regular anxiety. It also gave me chronic neck pain which is really hard to tolerate sometimes. But even these things are just a matter of time and are getting better every day. I&#39;m a tiny bit away from a standard definition of functional, but considering where I was just a year ago, I think that&#39;s forgivable.</p>

<p>The best part is, this is all despite my knowing more about the darkness of the world than ever before. I live in a country which gives me every excuse to be an angry anxious bitch (Iran) and I spend most of my day learning about the worst things humanity has ever done. I&#39;m back in my old room (which I ran away from multiple times as a teen) with my horribly dysfunctional family, but I&#39;m okay. And the blah blah is quiet for the most part. I know I still have a long way to go and a lot to learn, but I control the blah blah now, not the other way around. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> for the second part: My general anxiety is gone. I&#39;m generally doing VERY well, thanks for asking. The blah blah is under control, but it can always be better. And my life is completely changed as a result.</p>

<p>I really hope this helps you. Lemme know if you have anymore questions, or feel free to PM me if you prefer that :) Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the same way friend. Do some reading on esoteric topics :) here&#39;s a few I really enjoy about the true nature of reality</p>

<ul>
<li>conversations with God books 1-3</li>
<li>Seth material by Jane Roberts</li>
<li>any material by Edgar Cayce</li>
<li>even bashar channelings can be informational </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s tons of books out there dealing with who and what we really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this enters into Eastern mysticism territory.  I recommend the writings of Sri Nisargadatta, particularly his book &quot;I Am That&quot;, as well as pretty much anything by Osho.  And yes, take up meditation daily, and never cease.  It allows you to observe the mind, emotions, and sensory input without any participation in it.  This observation leads to liberating insight and transformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I Am That&quot; actually popped up quite a few times during my hour of research on this stuff earlier. Just got it for my Kindle although it wasn&#39;t on Amazon for some reason. Just one question - how does continued observation of the mind lead to liberating insights, transformation etc? I&#39;ve been reading about how meditation increases our vibration or something too. That&#39;s also a part of it, right?</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve been looking into Mindfulness so I think I&#39;ll begin that. One of the benefits being that it&#39;s something you can do in action. Which fits me perfectly as it&#39;s hard for me to sit still haha, at least right now. But thanks for your help:)</p>

<p>How has your own progression been with meditation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a nutshell (my understanding) is that it involves questioning for facts, rather than simply presenting facts. </p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re trying to lead people to the truth, get them to question it themselves. Become the student, not the teacher. Pose questions to them, don&#39;t just present a sheet of facts. It&#39;s truly the best way to teach/learn. </p>

<p>In half an hour one guy was able to teach binary to 22 students just by asking questions.</p>

<p>Dunno if you know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a>, but basically:</p>

<p>0001 -&gt; 2<sup>0</sup> = 1</p>

<p>0010 -&gt; 2<sup>1</sup> = 2</p>

<p>0100 -&gt; 2<sup>2</sup> = 4</p>

<p>1000 -&gt; 2<sup>3</sup> = 8</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a &quot;more complicated&quot; one:</p>

<p>1111 -&gt; 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup> = 15</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I hate when people use the Socratic method on me and I refuse to keep talking to them. I find it really condescending and cowardly that someone else won&#39;t just tell me what they think and try to get me to say it for them. Yes, logic is always truth preserving when founded on true premises, but it&#39;s easy to keep manipulating these premises and begging questions that only align to your particular view on a subject until you get the person to say what you want them to say and never let the other person have any say in the direction of the questions or the conversation at large. I guess on some people the method works, but it really just pisses me off personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seconded.  And if you like COTS, I recommend <em>The TRAP</em>, which I think is his best work.  <em>&quot;It felt like a kiss&quot;</em> can only be fully appreciated on cannabis, but if you do that, you&#39;ll totally totally get it and it will be glorious.  Power of nightmares is good for a while, but boring at times (imho).  All Watched over By Machines of Loving Grace is basically the Trap redux, with some confusing stuff at the end related to AIDS and failed rocketry.  <em>Bitter Lake</em> is his newest and it has revelations on Afghanistan that no one has said before, related to big dam projects in the mid 1900s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I have a different interpretation. So if you stare at the abyss, you go through a natural progression of emotions. First you are in shock, disgust, pain. Next you want to do something to ease the pain, maybe try to reduce it by deciding to take on the monster. Next you realize that the monster wants you to play in his turf to be able to even start combating it. Once you step into the monsters turf, you are left with no choice and slowly and gradually turn into exactly like the same monster you set out to destroy in the first place. And the cycle perpetuates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your last paragraph and reminds me of something that I&#39;ve thought of before that I will explain at the very end. </p>

<p>This &#39;power structure&#39; in place is apparently very stable. It is comprised of a group of international bankers whose fortunes and resources we, as commoners, could probably not fathom. The blight of greed and corruption came to America at an early age from across the Atlantic in England with the establishment of the Federal Reserve. This power structure is indeed international with America &#39;seeming&#39; to be its headquarters. But it is also like a multi-headed hydra, another head will always replace the one just slain. It would really take a global movement to even attempt to bring it down and even then, these people have many cards up their sleeves. </p>

<p>You see, I believe that we are truly spiritual beings residing in a physical world. Everything conceivable in existence has a vibratory imprint as physics has come to understand. You are a vibration in the ethers. A higher vibratory rate equates to positive feelings while a lower rate reflects anger, sadness, hatred, etc. </p>

<p>We probably cannot fight this power structure on a physical/material level as the deck is stacked heavily in their favor as it has always been. We must as a species keep our spiritual natures elevated as I think the opposite of this is the real goal of all the negative news you hear through the networks. Every sad story of injustice or neglect, greed or what-have-you works to bring our vibratory rate down and keep it down. </p>

<p>This all falls into perspective when you realize that this physical reality is only a school for souls. Are you going to feed the positive aspects of your being or focus on the negative. I have to catch myself when I fantasize about Hillary coming to some fatal misfortune and remember: our worst enemies are often our greatest teachers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so much information about discovering your true nature out there that I&#39;m not sure where to begin. But I would look into meditation as it is basically the mind looking at the mind and will aid in freeing yourself from fear and other negative emotions which, in turn, increases your vibratory rate or lightness of being. </p>

<p>As far as which type of meditation, each has their own preference but mine is Samatha or concentration meditation.</p>

<p>Consider this fact: that some of the best warriors throughout history have practiced meditation. Samurai, shoalin monks, and even marines and navy seals have used meditation to improve their performance and mental clarity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It is frustrating to me who lives in a country where education and healthcare is completely free to be laughed at that person pay most likely the same or more taxes on military. I&#39;ve been told the government does not have an obligation to feed the hungry or take care of the sick. Why do they feel that the government have an obligation to pay for a military bigger than the other superpowers on this planet - combined? I was of the impression that a military is suited to protect the country and people, not protect and enforce their laws on people on the other side of the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would gladly do anything and this is one of my daily struggles. I cannot for the life of me find a way to bring my philosophies into the world. I am incredibly poor and have health issues which(at the moment) hinders me getting a job and supporting myself. I am in contact with various doctors and government agencies which will help me sew a new life, so to speak. Hopefully I&#39;ll get back on my feet and spread my gospel about peace and prosperity without constraints from a industrial military complex worth half of the planets money.</p>

<p>I have been looking into volunteering outside of my country(my country makes sure there are no unfed or unhealthy individuals and since I am on the bottom part of the society I live in, it&#39;s hard for me to help others when I&#39;m struggling the most) but as of right now it&#39;s a little bit too expensive to me to find money for plane tickets and since my health is in decline, I am forced to fix that problem before I&#39;m going anywhere.</p>

<p>This is not only a negative aspect, I have plenty of time to plan my future and set up a way to recover and a goal to end up in a country or society where help is needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sorry, I meant that I am the lowest of where I live. In my country, there are no homeless people. We have a welfare &quot;net&quot; which catch people who struggle in life. They receive things such as money to buy food and necessities, and a place to live. Currently I cannot support myself and that&#39;s why I live of welfare. I have roughly 930 USD per month(I am assuming you&#39;re American or can translate USD into your currency) which should cover all expenses including trips to and from the hospital, medicine and all my bills.</p>

<p>I am rich compared to poor people in other countries but my current position is not that I can leave the country or volunteer like I want to. I am trying to educate my close friends and family with my philosophies. Most of the people who I meet and talk to regarding this have a pretty healthy view on society and life, which is why I believe it is hard for me to help here where I live. There are far worse places and I really want to go and help. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, I have a lot of excuses. I have no problem admitting this and maybe some day I can make up for this time in my life by going places I am more needed.</p>

<p>what&#39;s wrong with you physically speaking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maaaate! You will be amazed with the Magnesium! (and thriown in some vitamin D, which really helps and especially as a scandinavian you prolly don&#39;t get enough sunlight to make enough, so supplement it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most &#39;modern diets&#39; are badly lacking both these compounds and as <em>you are what you eat</em>, it stands to reason &quot;if you eat shit you&#39;ll feel shit&#39;</p>

<p>It is far and away The Best &#39;anxiolitic&#39; (anti-anxiety thing) and what&#39;s even better, you <em>will notice</em> it&#39;s effects in an HOUR or so! It&#39;s SO effective I&#39;m sadly stunned that most drs don&#39;t suggest it before <em>any</em> other treatments</p>

<p>IMHO it is as good as getting smoking dope without the &#39;stone&#39;! Your &#39;mind&#39; just chills out ... you will notioce the things which caused you to stress out simply don&#39;t!</p>

<p>One guy here I told about it who suffered from BAD social anxiety pm&#39;s me to tell me that for the <em>first time in many years</em> he attended a family xmas party and not only was &#39;able to saty all night&#39;, he had the best time and was blown away at how he only had a mild twinge of anxiety at the start but it went away quickly and he found himself &#39;the life of the party!&#39;</p>

<p>Take <em>at least</em> 800mgs perday, and like I said, you&#39;ll &#39;notice&#39; it&#39;s effects in ~60-90mins</p>

<p>It changed my life, nowadays If I have a stressful situation coming up I take some and voila, no fears!</p>

<p>it&#39;s the best $10 you&#39;ll ever spend!</p>

<p>p.s and let me know how you go, like I said, so far <em>every person</em> I&#39;ve told who&#39;s tried it has come back with BIG thanks! And as it &#39;works&#39; so quickly, you&#39;ll notice it straight away (if you&#39;re stressing) It pretty much stops your brain from &#39;running away with itself&#39; ... I think you&#39;ll Love it. It&#39;s Life changing.</p>

<p>If you read all that stuff I pm&#39;d you you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not exceptional to have these remarkable results</p>

<p>In fact I <em>expect</em> to hear back from you with &quot;wow!&quot; results! ;D</p>

<p>also, re: that sub I suggested you check out, feel free tpo ask me anything about it via pm and I&#39;ll be happy to clarify anything and/or point you in the right direction</p>

People who only know what they have been told and stand by it firmly. I remember when I was in kindergarten, they would have us sing to our flag before ever class session. &quot; I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all&quot; notice the line &quot;ONE NATION UNDER GOD&quot; We did this from Kindergarten - 5th grade.
         From the beginning they wanted us to think that the United States is the greatest country of all time, not only that but also the country with the most freedom. When in reality we are slowly becoming more and more enslaved by our own government. So few people can see it here. The media sways the populations opinion using fear. They controll us, and it&#39;s going to lead to our dimise. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are countrys plotting and attack on US soil, or maybe I&#39;m just crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao, if you think america is the only indoctrinated country then your wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;The Donald and Hillary are 19th cousins, according to genealogy experts.
According to a report in Extra TV, genealogy experts say Donald Trump and Hillary Rodham Clinton — the front-runners for the Republican and Democratic presidential nomination — share a common ancestor from England 18 generations ago.
Citing MyHeritage.com’s genealogy site Geni.com, the common ancestors are John of Gaunt, the duke of Lancaster, and third wife Katherine Swynford at the end of the 14th century — a century before Columbus sailed the ocean blue.&quot;</p>

<p>These same &quot;royals&quot; are ruling most of this entire planet, if they find someone in their way, they just find someone close to take them out with out most commoners ever figuring out what ever happened. </p>

<p>&quot;well if you trace our lineage back far enough were all related to a king or queen&quot;</p>

<p>Cool, if thats the case wheres my small loan of a million dollars, oh wait thats right i dont have the family name, i dont have the family money either......</p>

<p>If you think the royals anywhere on this planet dont know, your pretty misinformed.</p>

<p>The real question is this, their &quot;god&quot; that gives this bloodline, the direct descendants of adam and eve, the power to rule the rest of humankind, what kind of god is it, is it a alien, is it satan, like seriously i have no idea who they really worship. </p>

<p>Take a guess what the queen of England&#39;s most prized possession is.... it is not the money, its not the gold and jewels and it certainly isnt the land or power.</p>

<p>It is their pedigree charts proving their direct relation to adam and eve, the ones appointed by god to be the ruler of their kind.</p>

<p>That is if you believe any of the really old stories anyway..... so much history destroyed... i would love to know what hitler destroyed in the library of books that were 1-2000 years old. </p>

It seems insane to me to be made to recite a pledge to a flag, hand on heart, especially as a child in a classroom. I did go to Catholic school and so am familiar with the concept of being made to join in with morning prayers and such but this just seems on a whole other level to me. Can any Americans give me a little more insight? Did you at any age start to question the ritual? (I know I myself became disillusioned with the religious parts of my education at quite a young age.) Did your classmates? Did anyone ever refuse? I find the whole concept really interesting and would love to hear more about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I could count the number of people who actually think we definitely have the most freedom of any country on one hand. It seems to me people of most countries are simultaneously proud of their country and cynical, and the US citizens I&#39;ve known are no exception. </p>

<p>Most of the people I know don&#39;t seem to care about meaningless celebrity gossip. And certainly I wouldn&#39;t attribute the human desire to look at the &#39;popular kids of adult high school&#39; (celebrities) as entirely due to a few terrible covert ops. If that CIA document seems to imply some sinister scheme to control all conspiracy thoughts, I have news for you; bravado is human nature. No way a single agent has total power, because they&#39;re competing in a huge marketplace of powerful players, and even links between the powerful players might only imply they overlap just a little while still mostly opposing and competing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at th Illuminutty Psy-Ops pros on this thread going all MKUltra COINTELPRO insane. Open societies criticize and improve. Closed societies point to the future and say, &#39;we&#39;re a society in transition, always expanding and contracting our borders with plenty of ppl to blame for our problems and if we&#39;re to blame we just make something up about nasty Obama or Hillary just like our man Murdoch.&#39; </p>

<p>When the pros get through even the Russian government starts to look half way decent or at least an improvement over the bad old days of Stalin and Lenin purging away by the millions. When your government and politics is as broken as Russia you have to keep repeating Operation Paperclip, NSA CIA mind control, and Snowden videos. There is no comparison between the US media and state operated RT. As bad as Fox &quot;News&quot; and the amazing RW Republican libertarian lie (If we can hype Palin we can hype Trump) machine are, the US media is a shining beacon of light.  </p>

<p>The leagues fabricate news stories to fatten the amount of sports media to ingest, keeping people distracted from real-world issues. Sports are an extremely important piece of the paradigm to the Freemasons and they take great care in ensuring its exposure.</p>

<p>Look up Zachary K. Hubbard&#39;s recent work on the NBA Finals and, believe it or not, the string of ritual sacrifices leading up to it. The numeric connections are undeniable.

    <div class="md"><p>Uh yeah, it&#39;s pretty far out there. But we live in a sick world.</p>

<p>Anton Yelchin, the Star Trek actor who died the day of Game 7, is believed to have been sacrificed. Seems like a good chance Prince was too, and even Muhammad Ali, although when you start talking about really old people, who really knows.</p>

<p>Anyway, Yelchin&#39;s vehicle, which supposedly rolled backwards and crushed him, has a recall due to a counter-intuitive shifter design, which has resulted in over 100 reports of vehicle roll-aways, and over 30 injuries. However, Yelchin was the first one to have died due to the issue.</p>

<p>Seems like a rational explanation, however, it&#39;s also a great way to cover up his murder. I have a hard time picturing a smart, fit 27 year-old being so careless. Also, what are the odds that the vehicle would KILL him? He&#39;d be far more likely to sustain serious injuries.</p>

<p>When you look at the time of his death, and the numerology surrounding his name, birthday, and Star Trek release date, it&#39;s no longer crazy to think he was the last of the sacrifices. Hard for me to wrap my head around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I can&#39;t wrap my head around. I&#39;m not an evil, sick person, so I can&#39;t relate to those who are. But there&#39;s more than enough evidence and whistleblowers to convince me that the elites really are satanists capable of deplorable stuff.</p>

<p>In the case of Yelchin, here you have yet another popular actor who plays a key role in an upcoming big-budget film - not unlike Heath Ledger, Paul Walker, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Those deaths didn&#39;t exactly hurt box office sales, and Star Trek&#39;s revenue is sure to go even higher.</p>

<p>So, there&#39;s some profit to be made. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the only motivating factor. It&#39;s probably more of an exercise of power if anything. Interesting details on Anton:</p>

<p>Birthday = 3/11. Same date as Madrid attacks and Japan tsunami (3 x 11 = 33)</p>

<p>First name = Anton. Anton LaVey was the founder of the church of satan</p>

<p>&quot;Anton Yelchin&quot; - &quot;Accident&quot; - &quot;Kill&quot; all = 59</p>

<p>He died 101 days after his birthday. Philadelphia = 101 (Philly being the city named from Revelations, also the town college champs Villanova are from)</p>

<p>He also died <strong>33</strong> days before the release date of Star Trek, which comes out on 7/22. Written the other way, 22/7 is pi, representative of time and the infinite circle of life.</p>

<p>Also, Leonard Nimoy died on 2/27/2015, 511 days before the release date. 511 = Saturn, keeper of time. Saturn also = 93, the score the Cavs won Game 7 with.</p>

<p>Jeez...now I feel all loco...lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before writing anything off as ludicrous, do review the substance. Naturally, people find various patterns or similarities in some numbers that happen to be coincidental, but there are undoubtedly connections between the birth dates, death dates, and name gematria of many of these mysterious celebrity deaths.</p>

<p>I guess the part that irks me is that many people constantly claim that stars are having their murders covered up (remember Randy Quaid and his mention of &quot;starwackers&quot;), yet when another odd, suspicious death occurs, few people seem to question it. Zachary Hubbard, back in February, found many numerical connections to Prince earlier this year and even said we need to watch for his death. Then what do you know...on the queen&#39;s birthday, and with all sorts of connections to other important dates, Prince dies a sudden and mysterious death. Just saying, if a friend of mine died by getting crushed by his vehicle, I would not be satisfied with the complete lack of any investigation into a possible homicide.</p>

<p>&quot;No foul play suspected&quot;...LMAO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s going to take people starving in camps, sadly. And by then it will be too late. Trust me, there are plenty of Americans fed up with how bad things are. But America is full of followers. Every one is waiting for their neighbor to stand up and say &quot;who&#39;s with me!&quot; </p>

<p>And most people will stand up next to them and say &quot;Not me, you cheered against my football team last year.&quot; or &quot;Not me, you&#39;re the wrong color.&quot; or &quot;Not me, I&#39;m busy shitting out more kids.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a dire situation. I used to hope for a catalyzing event that would create unity, but there&#39;s far too much money spent on de-harmonizing the American public. Half of me wants to stay and fight, the other wants to just escape into the world and close the book on the American chapter of my life. I imagine a lot of other Americans are going through the same struggle. </p>

<p>It might not seem so from the outside, but there&#39;s no easy answers here.  </p>

The problem is that were literally trying to plan this under their noses. We tell them exactly what we think, and how we might try to stop it. That is the <em>real</em> purpose for all the data mining going on. I&#39;d like to believe there is an underground of &quot;good guys&quot; working on this shit, but they probably have tried to organize and failed. It&#39;s not in my nature to give up, but I&#39;m really starting to think this is way to big already to stop. It would probably require 50 percent of the US to instantly realize 9/11 really was an inside job.

    <div class="md"><p>They can print all the money they want and it won&#39;t matter if we aren&#39;t participating. That&#39;s the trick- we participate, we consent. They&#39;ve certainly made it a challenge to live this way but ultimately they cannot stop it, and if they do initiate violence to enforce your participation there are some pretty clear choices one is presented with.</p>

<p>We have to decide. Is it enough to just live? Or do we have to live free?</p>

<p>I have to live free. I cannot look at my children when they ask how the world ended up this way and tell them because I didn&#39;t do anything to stop it, but that would be the truth. This world is in its current state because we let it happen.</p>

<p>Best of luck to you, it&#39;s a difficult but rewarding path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You disengage. It&#39;s a system built on participation. Don&#39;t run from your home, oust the invaders. Learn the land. Learn to live off the land. Coordinate with others who are interested in doing the same. Learn skills that are essential to self-reliance. Growing food, building structures, maintaining structures, digging wells, animal husbandry, herbal medicines, etc. You don&#39;t have to learn it all but try to learn a little about a lot and try to specialize so you have a skill worth trading. These things may seem unexciting or unimportant in light of the technological direction the world is going in, but dependence is a major tool of the tyrants. If you can learn to truly not need them then you take back your personal power and become a free man. This ties in with a spiritual revolution because to achieve these goals you have to grow as a person and overcome the conditioning that leaves 99% of people psychologically broken in some form or another.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an awful lot of people who go through life without anything in their name. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived most of my life with nothing in my name. No credit cards, bank accounts, loans. My bills are in my fiances name currently, since he has credit built rather than none and that saved on deposits. I&#39;ve never had any trouble because of it, and I&#39;d recommend avoiding this whole idea of racking up debt to anyone. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly more difficult to live a life filled with fancy possessions, but it&#39;s not like we&#39;re forced into debt and credit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents went down this path and I wish I would have followed in their footsteps. I remember when we were kids they got their first credit card and just got fucked on interest, etc. so they saved and paid it off as fast as they could. They pay for everything as they go now and rarely deal with the banks except when they are forced to. When it&#39;s payday my Dad cashes his paper check (refuses to use direct deposit) and they take the amount of money they need and then the rest goes somewhere else that isn&#39;t even in our house. I don&#39;t even know where it is. He&#39;s always told me &quot;when I die son, trust me, you&#39;ll immediately know where it is and before you go to the funeral home or hospital I want you to go get it and then you need to put it away somewhere else the same way we have.&quot;</p>

<p>So I really have no clue where it is, how much it is or how they plan on getting it to me but it&#39;s like he has some dead man kill switch because he doesn&#39;t trust banks. </p>

I&#39;d be at a party with friends (<em>or miss a party because I wasn&#39;t on the Facebook invite and everyone uses that these days so I&#39;d get a last minute &quot;oh shit where is jasenlee text?&quot; letting me know something was going on</em>) and people would all be talking about whatever and I&#39;d have to constantly ask them what they were referring to because I was never part of the Facebook conversation. </p>

<p>But back to your censorship point. I made a rather long comment on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCS-xxFJzw8">this video of Emma Watson at the UN speaking about gender equality</a> (<em>90 seconds</em>) and apparently on Facebook you aren&#39;t allowed to talk about feminism and the problem with too many men being treated as predators. </p>

<p>Everything I wrote was deleted and then I wrote some more and that was deleted so I just gave up. I bitched about being censored on Facebook and surprisingly that hasn&#39;t been censored. I&#39;m just waiting for that to be deleted now or get one of their famous &quot;Your Account May Be Suspended&quot; messages if I keep up with it. </p>

I have tried to tell people what he warned us about, that the city is attempting to posion the water supply like in Flint. No one listened, said I needed to calm down. Well, the city fucked up and the posion ended up in the suburbs and so, on the news. Still, no one that I told before hand even batted an eye.

<p>I think you&#39;re forgetting that the government consists of people, and many of those people, especially in the military, are patriots with a family and friends among the working class. If the corruption and evil gets severe enough, those patriots might not be so loyal to their NWO bosses. They might feel more loyalty to the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why everything is compartmentalized. Everyone just does their job in their designated section of the &quot;assembly line&quot; and they&#39;re ignorant of what their coworkers are doing or what they themselves are doing for that matter. Look at all the innocent Middle Eastern people who are killed simply because they are holding a firearm or helping an injured person. You don&#39;t see people through the Infrared camera of an Apache, they are seen as combatants and treated as such.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a matter of National Security&quot; is basically the governments way of saying shut the fuck up, do your assigned tasks and keep your lips welded shut or you&#39;re no better than the terries. I wonder how many people like Snowden have tried to blow the whistle and found themselves in a black site or worse. Philip Schneider is a example of what happens when you&#39;re in &quot;too deep&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, compartmentalization is a powerful tool for maintaining control, and it works wonders in hierarchical organizations - whether they be corporate, governmental, military, or whatever.</p>

<p>In order to effectively insulate the soldiers from the people, all communication would have to be severed - which would not be terribly difficult these days.</p>

<p>Once communication is cut, the foot soldiers can be told anything - or nothing, and they would do what they are trained to do: Follow orders.</p>

<p>The question is whether Generals and other military men at the top ranks would be willing to cooperate with the scheme.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler">General Smedley Butler</a>: A group of powerful men tried to con him into participating in a coup against the US in the 1930&#39;s, and thanks to him, it failed.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">The Business Plot</a></strong></p>

<p>Butler then wrote a book: <strong><em><a href="https://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html">War is a Racket</a></em></strong>, exposing the shady underbelly of of a world where money and business interests us the military of the US and other countries as to enforce their will on others.</p>

<p>Hopefully there are still men with Butler&#39;s moral courage in the high ranks of the US military.</p>

<p>First of all, please cite a <em>single instance</em> where a U.S. military unit <strong>refused</strong> to engage U.S. citizens when ordered to do so, <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>Next, this fantasy about &quot;troops refusing to fire on their friends or neighbors&quot; was anticipated and &#39;solved&#39; so long ago I can&#39;t find it, but perfectly illustrated by the Katrina response.

The <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2005/09/10/defenseless-on-the-bayou">Oklahoma National Guard</a> and the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/five-years-later-no-accountability-for-post-katrina-gun-grab">California Highway Patrol</a>.</p>

Who cares if the government is fucking us in the day, we can all go home and look at facebook,  watch Kim kardashians cry on tv, wonder what our kids next practice or game is, play video games, take care of our busy life schedule. Most Americans are normal hard working people who can barely make enough to just stay ahead. When you work 40-60 hrs a week, have kids, and take care of your shit just to stay alive, you really don&#39;t have time for a revolution. There&#39;s no threat on our front doors yet. People aren&#39;t going to quit taking care of their personal lives until it is threatened. Hence the reason we have the media and the idiot box to keep us &quot;informed&quot; that everything is ok! The next election will change america, just be patient folks! Those who know the bullshit that is going on are ridiculed, called crazy conspiracy theorist. I&#39;ve literally almost got in violent situations because people CAN NOT handle the truth, they immediately react with vicious name calling and violence. America is fucked folks. </p>

Now that I look back, I find it absolutely fascinating the systems they have in place to keep you distracted. I saw intelligent people originally from other countries (and myself) resign themselves to keeping their heads down one by one. </p>

<p>One friend, who came from Europe and was incredibly well-educated and critical, moved to the US for college. I watched through the years as he got beat down by his professors and lost his love for knowledge, then as he took a &quot;temporary&quot; office job with a corrupt CEO and lost faith in doing any good for the community because such CEOs wouldn&#39;t let it happen. Now he&#39;s exactly the kind of person you described.</p>

<p>Same thing happened to me. Of course I wasn&#39;t gonna question anything that happened around me; I was too busy trying to find a job and preparing for all these different standardized tests I had to take to get into a school where I had to pay $70K a year. Anything I had left at the end of the day went into deciding between Hulu and Netflix and finding the best deal for video games on Amazon.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even need 12 years of education to brainwash you, it literally takes a year or two.. and the worst part is, the whole time you have this empty sense of righteousness and pride for no good reason (&quot;Oh I read an article about politics off CNN instead of going on Facebook; I&#39;m sooooo smart&quot;), so you don&#39;t think you need to learn or do anything anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish more than anything right now that I had better advice to offer you. </p>

<p>I left because I was trying to immigrate to the US in the first place. I have dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, so once I decided I couldn&#39;t be there anymore I just got on a plane to Iran and left that country for good before I had any serious ties. Of course, Iran is far from safe or healthy (although there is an unusually high tolerance for transgenders here), but Canada is an entirely different story.</p>

<p>Have you ever looked into moving to Canada? It might be your best option</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be more help :(</p>

<p>Not everyone who is active in politics is Totally Enlightened, that&#39;s for sure, but all those who are truly Totally Enlightened are most definitely active in politics.</p>

<p>Politics is Life. It touches the full field of living. That includes art, philosophy, science and spirituality .</p>

<p>The dynastic plutocratic families, the corporate oligarchs, the international banksters, many of whom are zionists (like the neocons and members of AIPAC) and/or members of secret societies, who dominate the politicians and the legal system and the financial system and the mainstream media and the corporations and the police and the military, are wreaking havoc upon the People of planet Earth and upon our beloved Mother Earth.</p>

<p>They have used their power to assassinate Presidents and Senators, start world wars and construct a society that suits them with little or no regard for the People or Nature.</p>

<p>They who are willfully ignorant and shamelessly apathetic about what they are doing in the world today are complicit in their heinous crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>They who are not giving their time, energy, talents and resources to the political process, to make sure that only the most Loving and most Wise individuals become our public servants, have blood on their hands and they can never ever dare speak of Love, Consciousness or Awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mob rule does not constitute democracy. I know that&#39;s a popular thing to say here, but it&#39;s not what any serious person ever means by the word. </p>

<p>Democracy guarantees inalienable individual rights, precisely as in a Constitutional Republic. That&#39;s because the sort of Constitutional Republic you&#39;re talking about is a democratic form of government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for exactly that. And I&#39;m against any form of government that fails to recognize and respect certain individual rights. </p>

<p>The US has democratic forms. It&#39;s just that they have ceased to function democratically. The people have no representation. Democratic elections are necessary to begin turning that around. But how to reform the electoral system? </p>

<p>Anyway, a functioning Constitutional Republic would meet most people&#39;s definition of a democratic form of government. I&#39;d certainly take it. And the whole legal framework is already in place. It feels strange to say, but if you and I are in favor of revolution, it&#39;s a revolution that restores the rule of our highest laws according to their original purpose and intent. We are talking about replacing our current government with a legitimate and legal one. Which is really to say that a revolution has already happened, a usurpation, and all we want to do is reverse it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy is defined as being &quot;direct&quot;, meaning one vote for everyone on every issue, and the last 100 years of treason have been dedicated to destroying the republic.</p>

<p>The United States is set up as a representative republic. States (with their own sovereignty) have voting rights as much as the people do. As for the people, limited franchise was set up for a reason.</p>

<p>The Senate is supposed to be comprised of individuals chosen by their respective state legislatures. The purpose being to represent the interests of specific states in the federal government (you can thank the illegally passed Seventeenth Amendment for the FUCKING TREASON it has become). That&#39;s why Senate representation is equal for all states; no state is better than any other. The House of Representatives is the part of government designed to represent the people on a federal basis, through individuals elected to represent portions of state populations. The purpose of the House is to grant roughly the same representation for each group of people (you can thank the Apportionment Act of 1911 for the FUCKING TREASON that it has become), thus representation on the state level looks proportional–states with bigger populations have more representatives, but it&#39;s not the state being represented, it&#39;s the people.</p>

<p>Back to limited franchise. The Founders knew that people who had no stake in the success of the nation had no business voting. They only allowed landowners to vote. &quot;I don&#39;t want my land to be stolen by a foreign body! I should vote to have a government that will work to defend my land!&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t want my land overrun by government oversight! I will vote for people to represent me in government who will respect my right to do what I will with the land that I own!&quot; are the arguments on the side of the person.</p>

<p>Today, things are different. A century of treason does a lot. The Founders would, after marveling over how good guns have become, personally run out and shoot everyone in Washington who let this happen.</p>

<p>The following changes should be made:</p>

<li>Repeal the 16th, 17th, and 19th amendments.</li>
<li>Restore voting rights to &quot;one vote per household&quot; and &quot;only for net taxpayers&quot;. Period. If you take more from the government than you put in, you have no say in where that funding goes. And splitting the family unit is the cause of ALL the damage done to society.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been off-reddit for a couple of days, I had no idea this was stickied. </p>

<p>My suggestions start by looking at the cause of the problem: </p>

<p>Greed + blackmail + short term agendas(ie getting voted back in next election cycle)</p>

<p>You start by looking for a solid independant candidate in your area who openly has a policy of anti-corruption( or at least get them to state that they are) , then focus on the incumbent senator and start by asking him/her &quot;what are your thoughts on HRC being essentially acquitted on negligence/treason, and if you cannot answer, when can we expect an answer?&quot;  </p>

<p>Start an online petition for those questions to be answered, then also start another petition stating that senator/local member will not get votes next election because of their lack of stance on corruption/transparency. </p>

<p>Hammer the incumbents social media asking these questions, over &amp; over, eventually a conversation will gain traction and you have to be well prepared with responses/evidence, most of which you can get from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &amp; other social media/forums. </p>

<p>We recently had an election where I live, and I made a point of doing this same tactic, organized with a local group on social media (28 people to be precise), albeit it was about fracking/gas wells in our area and local government corruption with land developers. </p>

<p>&quot;My guy&quot; didnt win, but he did get a large increase in votes, the &#39;winner&#39; only got in by the skin of his teeth, and it started a conversation about it. We only started it about 5-6 weeks ago, and I&#39;m not sure that if I started earlier, it could&#39;ve helped improve his result, but I know for sure that&#39;s going to be THE platform next election. </p>

<p>TL;DR use the same tactics your government uses, and use it against them. Gang up on your local incumbent and hammer them with uncomfortable questions. You&#39;ll be surprised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would categorize greed, blackmail, and short term agendas symptoms rather than causes. I would categorize our hierarchical and indirectly representative government as the cause. Our government promotes and enables these, and other crimes.  </p>

<p>Rather than support candidates, why not yourself run? Instead of demanding an end to corruption, how about boycotting the government altogether?</p>

<p>I admire your tactics. Don&#39;t misread my suggestions as incompatible with your own. I consider you an ally. I mean to be constructively critical: indirect representation appears to favor exploitation. </p>

<p>Our system of government (and most likely yours as well) appears expertly designed to perpetuate plutocracy. You can&#39;t end corruption without ending the (hierarchical and indirectly representative) government. </p>

<p>Anyone who desires a decentralized, horizontal, and directly representative government needs to realize that, upon winning control of any government that is not so, the first order of business shall be to make it so, before they kill you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got no college degree am an an anarchist. I got 51 votes (out of some 200) without campaigning one bit. Kinda ridiculous that only 1/4th of the population voted in the local election. </p>

<p>And now the village keeps coming after me for petty shit. Hell, I just found out my duck variance is on the agenda for Monday. </p>

<p>Part of me wants to flee town. I don&#39;t want to be a leader. I don&#39;t want a public office. I want to do away with public offices. To dissolve the corporate entity that claims jurisdiction over us. To communalize the various public utilities. I want my village to be a model village for the future. I don&#39;t want to run the damn thing though.</p>

<p>Fighting the system through legal channels is a drag. Defending yourself in a courtroom where you&#39;re unarmed and surrounded by armed guards and a lying shitheel of a judge is harrowing. Trying to convince people to speak up for themselves is like trying to rehabilitate trauma victims. </p>

<p>I wish you good fortune in your local endeavors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing corrupt about the US at all. It is what it is. It has fat out of shape button pushers glued to the mobile device telling them what to do and think. So as along as the rest of the world just does as they are told by the US all will be fine. Do not question just do. The US owes the rest of the world nothing and the world owes the US everything, so just give the US all your valuable resources and shut up.  OR,  we can all begin to understand what is driving this corrupt machine and learn what is the weakness that will bring the monster down. Is it money (the petro dollar will be destroyed soon anyways), is it the global positioning (US has all potential enemies surrounded), is it the raw need for dominance (but what is pushing the elitists to want complete omnipotent power). Honestly, living in the US, it feels like the world is hanging by a thread with a precisely timed failure and I am on the wrong side of the thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idealogical Subversion (Active Measures): </p>

<p>A process in which we change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in interest of defending themselves their families and their communities and their country.  </p>

<p>Four Steps: </p>

<p>1) Demoralization - 15 to 20 years.  Minimum number of years to educate 1 generation of students of the country of your enemy to be exposed to the ideologies of their enemy. </p>

<p>A person who is demoralized is unable to assess true information.  The facts tell nothing to him.  Even if I shower him with information and authentic proof, documents, pictures...he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom when a military boot crashes him.  </p>

<p>2) Destabilization - This time the subverter doesn&#39;t care about your ideas or what you do.  Economy, foreign relations and defense systems.  Marxist/Leninist ideas are astounding in the USA.  </p>

<p>3) Crisis - May only take up to 6 weeks to bring a country to crisis.  </p>

<p>4) Normalization - A cynical expression which may last indefinitely.  If you allow the country to come to crisis by promising all kinds of goodies and the paradise of earth to everyone to eliminate the principal of free market capitalization, destabilize the economy and impose big brother government in DC.  </p>

<p>&quot;Your leftists all this professors all this beautiful civil rights defenders...they are instrumental in the process of subversion.  Only to destabilize a nation.  When they job is completed they are not needed anymore.  They know too much.  Some of them when they get disillusioned when they see Marxists/Leninist come to power they obviously get offended they think they will come to power.  That will never happen of course.  They will be lined up against the wall and shot.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a repeat of any previous revolution.    The old media is dying,  newspapers and even cable tv,  are in serious trouble.</p>

<p>Corporations are in the middle of taking over all important functions,   but the Airbnb and uber models are showing how to set up new networks almost over night and bitcoin is showing that we could even live without government currencies. </p>

<p>In other words,  the institutions in our society are not constant,  they are evolving.    Washington has only evolved into a two branch mafia.    But they are becoming increasingly irrelevant in terms of delivering any value to the people or the economy.    So,  effectively,   people may let them hang on as a spectacle,  but increasingly they are more of an extortion racket than a facilitator of anything.    Not even justice.    </p>

<p>People turn their life over to a lot of things,  but will have second thoughts turning their life over to the government.     First the churces lost power,   then the kings and queens,  now the nation states are in decline.     What is now on the top is the richest people in the world who own the corporations and the politicians.</p>

<p>So,  taking out the politicians is no longer the point.    Now its a matter of undercutting the corporations and their mercenary enforcers.    And the millions of people who have turned their lives over to their corporate overlords.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,  that&#39;s the general idea.   But I think you have to optimize the rule of law to obtain or maintain a market place that reflects factors that decentralization has often tended to subvert.</p>

<p>In other words,  part of what is included in &quot;technology&quot; is the information/feedback that prevents the corruption and distortions of the crony capitalist system we have had in the past.    The pushing of &quot;externalities&quot; like air and water pollution onto tax payers might not gain traction if there was a pattern of disclosure that tends to level the playing field for all participants.    When we look at the rewards and penalties of any given system of interaction,  whether it be sports or market share,  there has to be a pattern of regulation that places quality of life and community as a higher value than rewarding unethical competition,  especially when the participants are able to take legal shelters in corporate or other artificial entities.</p>

<p>Even governmental and religious institutions tend to follow the bureaucratic  conventions of profit making corporations,   even NGO&#39;s tend to segment human &quot;capital&quot; into an identity that so easily overwhelms the model of a citizen participating in a democracy or even a republic.</p>

<p>In the biological model,  the model of organisms as part of an environmental whole,  in other words,  an interconnected ecology,  exchanges,  transactions,  are decentralized,   but information is communicated spontaneously,  not as part of a separate effort.    Its harder to hide externalities.    Its harder to concentrate power in an elite.</p>

<p>In other words,   when new rules are introduced,  they tend to create a new locus of information,  a new center for a new database,  often which had been designated as private property in the past,  reinforcing the power of elites over others.    </p>

<p>To the extent that there are private domains,   competition is restricted.     The nature of umpires,  the domain of records,  cannot remain public or unbiased when these rights are transferred out of the public domain to private players.    Private players are then elevated to special status,  and the meaning of a citizen is then segmented into classes of citizens,  some &quot;more equal&quot; than others :)</p>

<p>There has been a lot of propaganda equating the US with free markets,  democracy with capitalism.    There are elites who now manage the system as a &quot;personal&quot; asset,  in effect,  a plantation.</p>

<p>So,  at this point,  the rights to privacy and secrecy among those with the greatest economic power are the real issue,  and the road block to shared technology and decentralization.    They have convinced us that the system of private property is capable of generating prosperity,  but the system of &quot;government funded programs&quot; are generally a drain on the momentum of capital to create value.    An ideological stand against anything that can be labeled as communism or socialism.    Rather than apologize for the public domain,  perhaps we should point out that to the degree its function is private,  it has not actually been public domain,  but rather the mercenary force of an elite.</p>

<p>In other words,  there is a lot of disclosure and &quot;informing&quot; ahead of us before we will see a widening of influence from the few to the many.    A lot of propaganda that has become second nature to us is going to have to be disowned,  exposed,  and delegitimized.    And those in a movement to do so,  if their motive is a free lunch at the expense of the productive class,   or protection from the work of competition,  then they will rightly be exposed themselves as a new form of parasite,  a new dictator,  a new opportunistic attempt to seize power.</p>

<p>Open source.   Creative commons.   Much of the foundational work has already started.    The old ideologies are probably not going to help bring us together,   but a model of ecological systems might,  if the internet continues to weaken the authoritative monopoly of existing elites.</p>

<p>Technique #4 - &#39;INFORMATION COLLECTION&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a &#39;show you mine so me yours&#39; posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your &#39;favourite weapon&#39; and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favorite &#39;technique of operation.&#39; From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we had a leader to march with or some organization sure, but remember that our country is huuuge compared to most.  We have states bigger than some European countries.  Hell I just had a friend move from Texas back to Virginia and take 19 hours driving. I told her we are making one trip because that drive sucked.</p>

<p>Believe me when i say we want it, but need a leader. If someone had a plan,  I would be on it in a second,  but without 100,000 people marching the capital,  it will mean nothing. I have been to DC and seen large groups of protestors. I saw a few dozen in front of the white house two weeks ago. One was a damn noble cause and I cant remember it, so you know how that went. There were 20+ people there handing out info on that too. </p>

<p>Basically, someone figure something out who has some power, because no one will follow a nobody and that&#39;s a damn shame. </p>

I don&#39;t  use social media much anymore and Twitter was never a thing I liked much, but if i tweeted and all 6 of my followers saw it, nothing would come of it.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. You can go ahead and waste your time, people who are smart enough should just seek to survive what is coming. There are no political solutions to a famine, solar storm, plague/virus, or depletion of oil. Go ahead and see if your waking up of people will solve those problems.</p>

<p>And supporting a jew leftist who is advocating stronger government isn&#39;t helping the problem either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s crazy to see not only a total lack of any indication that the people in our government are working towards a better world for all, but to suspect that they may either be deceptively doing the opposite, or are completely oblivious to their duty and/or identity as a human being. It seems like part of being alive is a desire for positive change, even at a fundamental level ie evolution. Being alive is a surprise, and with a finite lifespan we all do our best to find IT, the ever mysterious quality that we all desire and work for. Conspiracy or natural phenomenon, it&#39;s been suggested that factors in our world work to keep &quot;IT&quot; out of our experience. People have claimed that institutions which promise &quot;IT&quot; to us secretly work to eliminate IT. 
Government and Religion are two major forces in our lives. One steals our money resources and the other steals our spiritual resources, so conspiracy theorists say. We all want the same thing, but natural law seems to not only allow but perhaps even favor violent greed, and this election is seen as a major indicator that something is extremely wrong. Neither candidate communicates capability or even the slightest interest in anything other than lip service. Their actions and motives debatable, a mystery, but pretty definitely not what they should be, and not what we need them to be. Why? Greed, ignorance? Who knows. Can we do something about it? What we need is intelligent and moral people running the show. We need to make the cooperative spirit and pursuit of a better world for all the prime directive of humanity. We don&#39;t need violence, revolution, extinction. We need all of our fellow people to understand. We need to once and for all establish ourselves as one team, team earth, team utopia. Team positive universe. Is this asking the impossible? NO. Is this difficult? Sure. What can we do? I don&#39;t know. Hopefully this helps : / </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elite are at war with the american people but we&#39;re also at war with ourselves. They know this and they perpetuate this. Black vs White, Muslim vs Christian, Gay vs Straight and the big hitter, Liberal vs Conservative. We talk of revolution when we haven&#39;t even united as a people. This is step one. Yes, it sounds lame, but you need to love and forgive your neighbors, friends, family for any perceived differences.  </p>

<p>Step 2: Get off your ass and get your friends/family of their asses. They won&#39;t like you for it but you owe it to them and to yourself to at least try. Our parents always said TV would rot your brain but it wasn&#39;t the cartoons it&#39;s the damn news and reality shows. Discourage that brainwashing garbage every chance you get. Fuck, start a kickball team. Something! Get them off their asses. Nobody can revolt if they cant even run a mile.  </p>

<p>As OP said, you can enact change through your local government but I believe this is step 3 or 4.  </p>

<p>The number of 18-34 year olds who are eligible to vote is 94 million (40% of the total electorate).</p>

<p>However, only 3.6 million voted (4% of the youth electorate).</p>

<p>The youth need to get their act together.</p>

<p>Each and every one of them, without exception, needs to stop what they are doing and put their life on hold and become well-informed individuals, free of misinformation and disinformation, and get actively involved in the political process to usher in a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom.</p>

<p>If only 80% of the youth ever decide to become well-informed and vote, then we will have a progressive President, a progressive Senate, a progressive House, and a progressive Supreme Court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voting has never been tried in the USA.</p>

<p>When was the last time that at least 80% of the People were well-informed, free of misinformation and disinformation, AND gave their time, energy, talents and resources to the political process to make sure that only the most Loving and most Wise among become our public servants?</p>

<p>Only 60% of the People vote in the Presidential elections.
Only 20% of the People vote in the Presidential primaries.
Only 40% vote in the Senate and House elections.
Only 13% vote in the local elections for Mayor, City Council and the Congressional seats.</p>

<p>Progressive types, like artists, musicians, spiritual types, are not voting. And the ones who are voting are not well-informed and so they waste their vote not voting for the best candidate.</p>

<p>The 18-34 year olds are a whopping 40% (94 million) of eligible voters (235 million).</p>

<p>In past elections, only 24% (23 million) of them turn out to vote in the Presidential primary and only 40% (38 million) in the general election.</p>

<p>For Congressional seats, the turnout has been only 20% in the general election.</p>

<p>46% of eligible 18-24 yo are not registered to vote.</p>

<p>37% of eligible people with incomes under $30,000 aren&#39;t registered to vote.</p>

<p>In the 2016 primary, a total of 61 million (26%) turned out to vote.</p>

<p>The number of 18-34 year olds who are eligible to vote is 94 million (40% of the total electorate).</p>

<p>However, only 3.6 million voted (4% of the youth electorate). They were 12% of the total votes.</p>

<p>If only 80% of eligible voters invested the time and energy to be well-informed and actively involved in the political process, it would be enough to overcome any shenanigans from the dynastic plutocratic families, the corporate oligarchs, and the international banksters, many of whom are zionists and/or members of secret societies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quit whining, we&#39;ve got this. No country on earth distrusts the very idea of government more than the United States. People in other countries sit around and talk shit on the USA, meanwhile their own governments are just as corrupt if not more. The difference is that we have a democracy founded by revolution, and the right to revolt is ingrained in our national history. The rest of the world either copied us or had revolutions for worse things than democracy. Remember: &quot;democracy is not the best system, but it is the best we can come up with for now&quot;</p>

<p>You should all be wary of calls for revolution. They typically do not work in favor of the people. Any &quot;revolution&quot; in America will only result in a new government that will soon be corrupted, if not corrupt from inception.</p>

i have been consistently blinded by the rage i&#39;ve felt while growing up in this goddess forsaken sack of shit called the usa, the &quot;greatest country in the world&quot;. i wish i&#39;d never stood for the pledge of allegiance, it made us look like hitler&#39;s youth, but they started us in kindergarten so i just kept standing up. stopped saying it in high school. i hate all stupid fucking flags of men&#39;s wars and i hate our flag the fucking most.</p>

<p>the police are not persons, they are ego-maniacal psychopaths. and yet so many say &quot;there are some good ones&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re just doing  their joooobbbbs&quot;. save a life, kill a cop.</p>

<p>i feel like luke wilson&#39;s character in <em>idiocracy</em>. i know that my iq is some standard deviation above average, but holy hell.. is everyone really this dumb?</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think so, though they certainly are dumbed down over many generations. they are SCARED. they sit there and say &quot;bluh bluh i would dddiiiieeee for my children&quot;. but no they fucking wouldn&#39;t, or they&#39;d they&#39;d stick their necks out right now. and when i bring up our responsibility to fight the nwo, they say &quot;i can&#39;t because i have kkiiiiddddsss&quot;. </p>

<p>well there won&#39;t be anything left for them, scaredy cat. hope the gutlessness and laziness will be worth it when you&#39;re on your deathbed - probably from pollutant-induced cancer - and you realize what you&#39;re leaving for your children. A HELL YOU HAVE REFUSED TO STAND AGAINST.</p>

<p>domesticated morons breeding and sucking down big gulps. and their despicableness doesn&#39;t hold a candle to that of our elite owners.</p>

<p>so... i am not vaccinating my child(ren) when my husband and i start a family next year. i am not giving that kid a social security number. i  DO NOT GIVE A FUCK. NOT DOING IT. i&#39;ve studied enough to know that none of this is real and wild horses could drag me round the world and i STILL WOULD NOT DO THAT SHIT.</p>

<p>in closing, i extend my middle finger heartily before the all seeing eye, poised to poke it out at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>targeted attacks on instigators based on NSA data collections, Powergrid shutdowns, drone attacks, armored tanks, and barrage of crap we have no way of fighting off with just some guns. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Precedent</strong></p>

<p>The use of the ‘drones’ argument is to suggest that America’s military power is far too powerful for the people to defeat, thereby making gun ownership for defense against government tyranny unnecessary. The idea that the one with the bigger stick wins is a common mistake. People often forget how the country started and how a bunch of traitors and revolutionaries were able to defeat the immensity of the British military. If this argument was taking place in the ’60s, people would be announcing ‘napalm’ rather than ‘drones’, and yet napalm did very little to stop the US from being defeated by a bunch of rice burning, pajama wearing, tunnel dwelling Vietnamese. And speaking of pajama wearing, what about Afghanistan? You go find Al Qaeda and tell them about ‘drones’ and they will be quick to remind you that they were able to drag the US into an 11 year, unsustainable war, the cost which helped lead America to an incredible financial crisis. If a bunch of cave-dwellers struggling with the cocking handle of soviet era AK-47s can keep a war going for 11 years, think of what well-educated, well-armed, partially experienced American citizens could accomplish.</p>

<p><strong>Ineffectiveness</strong></p>

<p>A drone strike might look effective when shot at some desert hut, but it doesn’t translate well to domestic civil war. Every citizen the US bombs is one less taxpayer, one less worker, one less consumer. Every building is one less factory, one less office building, one less residence. Every bomb the US would drop on its own soil and people is destroying its own precious resources. Hardly a sustainable way to wage war. Every bomb dropped also invites more and more revolutionaries. If you thought civilian deaths in the Middle East brought outrage here, think about what American civilian deaths would bring. Let’s say that 200 people gathered outside the Pentagon, protesting and screaming for blood. What is the government going to do, bomb their own military installation? How is that drone going to stop an unarmed protest, or even effectively distinguish between an unarmed protest and an armed one? How will that drone confiscate weapons and apprehend major revolutionary figureheads? It has been said before and I’ll repeat it–police states need police. Grunts on the ground. And that grunt is in for a bad day when he is head to head with an equally armed American citizen behind every door. In a few seconds, a simple search can show you all the shortcomings of drones and how one could combat them.</p>

<p><strong>Defectors</strong></p>

<p>Killing rag-heads video game style is one thing, but how is that drone operator going to feel when he is forced to drop bombs on his own countrymen? His brothers and sisters and friends. How quickly are those politicians (who we are so quick to call slimy and self-interested) switch sides to save their own skin? Even without this almost certainly occurring variable, military and police amount to a few million while civilians equal hundreds of millions.</p>

<p><strong>International</strong></p>

<p>NATO is quick to enter revolutions in other countries when the government massacres its people, so what would their reaction be when the US government indiscriminately bombs its own people? Other nations would also assist in any civil war for their own reasons (perhaps they have a vested interest in seeing the US weakened by domestic warfare).</p>

<p><strong>Freedom</strong></p>

<p>Even if the government and military was infinitely more well armed and the chances of victorious revolution against its tyranny was one in a million, so what? Should we just give up without trying and submit to oppression? Whatever happened to Live Free Or Die? Aren’t our freedoms worth fighting for no matter then odds, are they not worth dying for?</p>

<p>The people who wrote the Second Amendment understood what government oppression was. They knew what revolution entailed. And they understood that the American people may have to do something similar to what they just did to ensure they remained free. So they kept guns available for citizens. But the main reason their ownership should continue is not to fight a war but to prevent it. The Second Amendment protects the rest and is a constant reminder to the government that an act of unwarranted aggression against its people can be swiftly retaliated against. Ultimately it’s not about guns. It’s about freedom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing to get rid of the guns, but the points you make here are equally applicable to peaceful revolt, without some of the drawbacks. It would have to be on a scale far greater than OWS, for sure, which would mean the impetus would have to be far greater as well, but let&#39;s compare OWS to the Bundy Ranch and Oregon standoff.</p>

<p>OWS was ignored, ridiculed, and maligned by the media, yet millions still supported the idea of the cause, if not the methods or the strategies. The civil rights movement might even be a better example, as they did achieve many of their goals (while still being placated and somewhat subdued by the end.)</p>

<p>When you use violence against the state, they will spin it as violence against the people. The Bundy Standoff is viewed by many as a bunch of crazy right-wingers, even by many on the right, because when you use violence, the state can justify their use of force. </p>

<p>But when you choose not to use violence, even in the face of violence, you bring people to your side. They see who are the ones who use brutality, and who are the ones being brutalized. </p>

<p>This is me honestly asking, do you know of any group who has taken up arms against their government and improved their lot? I will ask you to exclude the American Revolution, as that can very much be seen as a people seeking their sovereignty from a foreign power. I know the distinction might not mean much from our current situation, but in terms of rallying the people, it was much easier to paint the British as an enemy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The process of corruption in the US govt has been going on longer than my whole life and longer than my parents or maybe even my grand parents.  We are so deep into it that the only real answer is a giant revolution.  We see people like Bernie Sanders making calls for this revolution, we&#39;ve seen occupy wall street make the news, we&#39;re just at the beginning of this crazy thing, it might take a long time.  As more people in the US wake up to the fact that our government is not acting in our interests and taking us for a ride the louder and stronger this revolution will be but for now it is slow.  Cakes and circuses rule the day and it&#39;s tastier and more immersive than ever, I&#39;m just as guilty as anyone for partaking in it.  But I see it, I see this growth in a serious revolution growing.  This isn&#39;t going to be easy and it&#39;s not going to happen over night, one by one, brick by brick people will see that we need real actual change in how things are run just like how our rights and our actual say has drip by drip been dissolved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hi, late to the party. </p>

<p>But what a lot of people don&#39;t see in the US is that how much is washed over, how much even we as US citizens don&#39;t see. There&#39;s been over 150 shootings/mass shootings this year alone in the US and most of them have never even been touched on. </p>

<p>As &quot;what&#39;s it going to take?&quot; question, I ask myself that question every day. Fuck, in some states, I literally can&#39;t even take a piss in peace. </p>

<p>Edit: Much like the Germans in WWII, afterwards, they had so much guilt over what they had done. In the US, it&#39;s almost celebrated (in a lot of rural and/or southern areas) that we put fucking human beings into slavery. That we have this guy in office that&#39;s pretty much the new age Hitler. That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with the US. I hear people coming from other countries, so happy to be here and I just look at them and ask why. My best friend&#39;s dad jumped across the Mexican boarder to start a better life here in the US and I asked him one day if this is all worth it. He told me yes because of how bad Mexico is but he says that it wasn&#39;t what he dreamed it would be. I think in Germany (some fact check me if I&#39;m wrong because I&#39;m not 100% on this), it&#39;s illegal to fly the Nazi flag, or at least it is in public. That&#39;s what should happen with the Confederate flag. And in some places, you can&#39;t wear or fly anything with the confederate flag because of its ties to slavery and the KKK, not to add in today&#39;s standards, the South in the American Civil War would be considered traitors. I bring this up whenever I see someone flying it, people who are so &quot;proud to be an American&quot;, I ask them, &quot;I know you&#39;re proud to be an American, but you obviously never paid attention in history, especially since it&#39;s been shoved down your throat since you could read, that the South lost. And they are considered traitors in today&#39;s standards so, I&#39;m glad to know you support the KKK, slavery, and American traitors.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we can&#39;t let the government buy any more of our property. Cause when shit hits the fan guess who&#39;s land we will be on...? The gov&#39;s, they won&#39;t have to &quot;ask&quot; to come into our property, they will just do it. Oh and the &quot;Jade Helm&quot; training... We better stop letting them &quot;train&quot; locally in the big city states. They&#39;ve already got police uniformed in military suits participating in the patrol. It&#39;s all martial law taking place, the more we allow them to patrol and train the more they are going to be around. It&#39;s going to start being normal for them to be around and then once they have the right crisis, BOOM. They are down already in patrol already &quot;training&quot;. You see if they tell us they are &quot;training&quot; we the people won&#39;t have the idea they are actually just down here patrolling more and more military until it&#39;s normal for them to just &quot;be down here&quot; (in the cities patrolling/pvt property training). Then what? They try and come to take our guns and when we say no what can we do? There are hundreds of military police and officers around us... We can&#39;t stop this shit, it&#39;s already here. All we can do is put our hands in the faith of God and ask for his protection. And then shoot them bitches when they try and violate the constitution. </p>

<p>America is fucked up because people are fucked up. But not all people are fucked up, which means not all of America is fucked up. The people who know that true freedom is equality will never let our dream slip away. </p>

<p>A war is coming, but there will be more than two sides: the left, the right, and the middle. The middle is the truth. The truth is love. As long as you stay true to love, love will stay true to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We could always boycott the government. But that would be pretty hard. We could all use natural water and food supplies and only buy from other citizens. We could altogether stop paying taxes. I mean, what are they going to do? Arrest everyone? Then we have the issue of lawlessness and murder, pillaging, etc. We could also make our own governments. All in all, it would be very difficult. We would need almost everyone to be involved and more than enough people and defense to overthrow our leaders. And I&#39;m pretty sure there would be many military personnel who would join in. I probably sound crazy, but that&#39;s because I AM going crazy. I already have paranoid personality disorder and the stuff that&#39;s been going on here lately doesn&#39;t help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall years ago when Paris, France&#39;s public transportation system (pension issues) was being protested by not only the workers strike, but the public as a whole. The streets were flooded with people, and I mean FLOODED with thousands who were in disagreement with the government&#39;s actions (police violence and all resulted). The city being built on a grid was in a complete lock down and none of the public transportation was active. Eventually, the authorities caved and the Parisians got back to life with the rights they had worked for and deserved. What is the difference between our culture where they act and we do not? Is it at the start of schooling? Or is it from being oppressed for SO LONG that they finally fight back? I understand that the elite are always seeking to oppress, but has it not been going on long enough that people are not ready to say &quot;enough&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to discourage anyone, but your suggestion seems flawed to me. Every movement has a face, usually backed by people with similar views but with less charisma, confidence or resources. Hypothetically if I was to try to find and get an honorable candidate elected in my region, what would stop the PTB from just kennedying my ass? That is what I think would ever happen if we did get a decent candidate into ANY solid public office. They would be approached by men in suit and shown a version of the zapruter film but from the angle where you can see the two gunmen on the grassy knoll.  We would need a nearly endless supply of selfless honorable candidates as they would all either succumb to fear and give in to the PTB demands or be killed. I mean if you look around you can see that whistleblowers and honorable people &quot;commit suicide&quot; by 2 shots to the back of the head, or another &quot;normal&quot; circumstance. </p>

<p>I want to fight so badly but sadly I am also afraid as I have a family. If there was a real platform that I thought could make it I would do EVERYTHING I could to help it along, but until then I am going to keep hiding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what are we supposed to do when things are rigged such as elections and the DNC e-mail leak has proved it but she still might have a shot at being our president. That just shows how much power they have lol. You think someone with normal secret clearance fuck something up 1/100th the ratio of that would be in jail for a fucking while. This is something Edmund Burke never faced, because now we have a world that can be easily controlled because of technology. Times have changed and so have the chances on ever fixing this stuff. </p>

<p>lol they sure as shit won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Yeah why don&#39;t you guys use your second amendment rights that you all jizz about to use your guns to take over the government? I mean, that&#39;s the reason you have guns, right? That&#39;s literally the only argument you have for owning guns?</p>

<p>Not the only argument for owning guns. </p>

<p>Self defense, hunting, collecting/investing and for (,) our well regulated militias.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t car jacked once because I had a handgun. The other guy just had a tire iron. My dad has given me guns that my grandfather gave him and I will give to my kids. Hunting wild hogs as population control can save native species that now have to compete for food. I once bough an AR15 before the assault weapons (cosmetic features) ban in the 90&#39;s. I sold it for a very nice profit a few years later. A gun is a tool. Your supposition that no one will use their guns to take over the government is probably correct but specious in it&#39;s causality for owning guns.  </p>

<p>Government begins noble when times are hard, strong idealists take control and form a democracy or democratic republic. Life becomes comfortable under the rule of strong idealists, people live cushy lives and cease to care about government. Government loses accountability and becomes overrun by corruptible opportunists at this point, and the opportunists use country as bank account and as leverage to get money from infringing corporations. At this point the country becomes as much an oligarchy as a republic/democracy, the country falls into chaos after years of neglect, the people rise and create a government of strong idealists.... rinse and repeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we&#39;re not going to do anything about it, because the government is generally good, full of lots of good people, and because our system of government has resulted in the most profitable/powerful/wealthy/best-living that anyone has ever seen on our continent. The corruption will change gradually on it&#39;s own as culture progresses over the next 100 years with the advent of the internet and constant omnipresent awareness of everything everyone does -- and with the influx of new kids in the government and spy agencies who very likely grew up hating &quot;the spies and the corruption&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same as racism  changing, eventually things improve because the awareness of the problems spread. We&#39;ve progressed pretty far since the slavery days, and the gay-hanging days, and the witch-burning christian fundamentalist days. Things change and progress naturally, we can&#39;t MAKE IT happen by &quot;doing anything&quot;, it&#39;s natural social evolution we&#39;re all witnessing, not something that can go away just because you prosecute or imprison one specific &quot;corrupt person&quot; or criminal group.</p>

<p>all anyone needs to do is talk about the problems they see. the internet allows this and will help social evolution progress because we&#39;re not stuck in controlled/corralled institutional idea exchanges like we used to be, where only the few could attend college (or a good college), and the views disseminated are controlled by the staff - or when you had to be in a specific hippy group to have access to specific ideas, nowadays the ideas of social progress spread on the internet.</p>

<p>you&#39;re safe, you have access to more resources than anyone else on earth, you have enough to eat, easy credit, generally reliable basic laws, no one is going to &quot;do&quot; anything, and no one should &quot;do&quot; anything. positive social change will happen naturally as the internet generations come to power and leadership roles throughout society. Nothing dramatic needs to be done about it.</p>

<p>I think people who live in other countries should reserve judgement about places they don&#39;t fully understand. I don&#39;t go on rants about the Brexit, I&#39;m not a Brit nor a citizen of the EU. I don&#39;t question Russia&#39;s foreign policy, they have a right to determine their own future despite what their neighbors believe. I think people who don&#39;t live in America and don&#39;t have anything invested here should keep their opinions to themselves. Why doesn&#39;t OP try and make a positive change in his own home?

Then you hear NSA CIA DHS Hillary does it and gets off, Snowden defects to Russia. Simple minded updated John Bircher National Enquirer manipulated blends of PSY-Ops true lies. </p>

<p>Known as &quot;alternative&quot; news or &quot;what Hillary and her NWO government and lamestream media don&#39;t want you to know.&quot; What &quot;really&quot; happened at Benghazi?? Wikileaks has all her emails and soon you&#39;ll have them too and SHE will concede and bow to Trump and bla bla bla. Probably just the opposite will happen. </p>

<p>Thousands of bogus You Tube Russian troll channels align perfectly with Brit and US conservative Murdoch tabloids, NRA, neo Nazi websites, blogs (NY Post, Fox News, Breitbart, Drudge, The Observer, Daily Caller, Koch libertarians, RT, National Enquirer) making them difficult to tell apart. Right wingers forever wrapping themselves in flag, country and religion pointing righteous fingers at everyone else. As if in a mirror. Lefties aren&#39;t half as bad although they do try. </p>

<p>Why do Russian brigades concentrate on You Tube &amp; domestic and foreign comment sections? Their own sad excuse of a government is so broke with corruption it&#39;s like the air, it&#39;s everywhere &amp; isn&#39;t even noticed anymore (unless you&#39;re in Beijing). Which means they have to showcase the faults of open societies and repeat and repeat them until the Russian Gov. starts to look good. </p>

<p>A Russian politician or journalist murdered? (Yawn) Putin&#39;s former RT &quot;Minister of Truth&quot; &amp; disinformation found dead in DC? (Laughs) Which happened only days after the Russian Olympic scandals broke? (What again?)</p>

That being said, it&#39;s not a bad system considering we have control of a majority of the worlds resources because politicians and corporations have hoarded it all from third world shit holes that wouldn&#39;t of been able to do anything with the resources in the first place. America was founded because we kicked a bunch of people off their land and used the resources available to thrive. It&#39;s time to start supporting our country in developing the wasted space in the Middle East, Africa, and South America.</p>

<p>I assume you are talking about security of a &quot;free state&quot; right?</p>

<p>Most people feel MERICUHLICIOUS and can&#39;t fathom any opposing opinions. So perception in the states is not there yet, start pricing their electronics at &quot;living wages&quot; prices and you will see panties in a wad.

    <div class="md"><p>Mob rule does not constitute democracy. I know that&#39;s a popular thing to say here, but it&#39;s not what any serious person ever means by the word. </p>

<p>Democracy guarantees inalienable individual rights, precisely as in a Constitutional Republic. That&#39;s because the sort of Constitutional Republic you&#39;re talking about is a democratic form of government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for exactly that. And I&#39;m against any form of government that fails to recognize and respect certain individual rights. </p>

<p>The US has democratic forms. It&#39;s just that they have ceased to function democratically. The people have no representation. Democratic elections are necessary to begin turning that around. But how to reform the electoral system? </p>

<p>Anyway, a functioning Constitutional Republic would meet most people&#39;s definition of a democratic form of government. I&#39;d certainly take it. And the whole legal framework is already in place. It feels strange to say, but if you and I are in favor of revolution, it&#39;s a revolution that restores the rule of our highest laws according to their original purpose and intent. We are talking about replacing our current government with a legitimate and legal one. Which is really to say that a revolution has already happened, a usurpation, and all we want to do is reverse it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seconded.  And if you like COTS, I recommend <em>The TRAP</em>, which I think is his best work.  <em>&quot;It felt like a kiss&quot;</em> can only be fully appreciated on cannabis, but if you do that, you&#39;ll totally totally get it and it will be glorious.  Power of nightmares is good for a while, but boring at times (imho).  All Watched over By Machines of Loving Grace is basically the Trap redux, with some confusing stuff at the end related to AIDS and failed rocketry.  <em>Bitter Lake</em> is his newest and it has revelations on Afghanistan that no one has said before, related to big dam projects in the mid 1900s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived in the US for a year and was supposed to stay there indefinitely, so I was getting used to the American lifestyle and all. Now that I look back, I find it absolutely fascinating the systems they have in place to keep you distracted. I saw intelligent people originally from other countries (and myself) resign themselves to keeping their heads down one by one. </p>

<p>One friend, who came from Europe and was incredibly well-educated and critical, moved to the US for college. I watched through the years as he got beat down by his professors and lost his love for knowledge, then as he took a &quot;temporary&quot; office job with a corrupt CEO and lost faith in doing any good for the community because such CEOs wouldn&#39;t let it happen. Now he&#39;s exactly the kind of person you described.</p>

<p>Same thing happened to me. Of course I wasn&#39;t gonna question anything that happened around me; I was too busy trying to find a job and preparing for all these different standardized tests I had to take to get into a school where I had to pay $70K a year. Anything I had left at the end of the day went into deciding between Hulu and Netflix and finding the best deal for video games on Amazon.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even need 12 years of education to brainwash you, it literally takes a year or two.. and the worst part is, the whole time you have this empty sense of righteousness and pride for no good reason (&quot;Oh I read an article about politics off CNN instead of going on Facebook; I&#39;m sooooo smart&quot;), so you don&#39;t think you need to learn or do anything anymore.</p>
