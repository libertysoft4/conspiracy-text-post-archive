Everyone who wants this to happen has some misconception they will personally benefit in some way, they&#39;ll be the last man standing and finally reap all the rewards life or society owes them.</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth is society will keep chugging along and we are very fortunate to enjoy a high standard of living in the first world.</p>

<p>Are there problems? Fuck yeah there are: wealth inequality, a broken justice system, a monopolized &#39;free&#39; market. I don&#39;t see any problem with trying to fix these things. Yet you have to be realistic about the world you live in, not pray for a collapse, or that you&#39;ll win the lottery.</p>

<p>Life can suck some times, it&#39;s not a fair world. Try to do the best you can to find happiness for yourself. There is huge danger in becoming mired in the seemingly significant problems of the world. Your search for truth can end up in disappointment  and rob you of the peace you&#39;re trying to obtain.</p>

<p>This is the paradigm that prevents democracy from working properly.</p>

<p>Just because you believe you are living in a stable environment doesn&#39;t mean that you should stop paying attention.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t the economy. The problem is that the US is transforming itself into an empire with a completely oblivious population.</p>

<p>The last 50 years of US foreign policy has only been destabilization, destruction, and death of innocents. </p>

<p>Ron Paul said that we need to be aware of blowback. What I believe he really should have told us is to beware of the government that keeps it&#39;s people ignorant in order to further the goals of a few. </p>

<p>When your country scoffs at international law and circumvents the peace process by forming independent coalitions in order to wage war you should start asking questions.</p>

<p>Secondarily I was incarcerated for a period of my life and I understand how little one can effect the structure around oneself, and just how upsetting being confined or restrained can be.

    <div class="md"><p>I think these ideas, mostly taken from eastern philosophy, are a metaphor for personal devlopement and growth in the physical world. You are reincarnated constantly throughout life as your mind develops and builds upon its past knowledge.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, thank you for the that reply, I really appreciate you being such an open and honest person.. it&#39;s truly inspirational. Anyone would be lucky to have such a compassionate, optimistic and visionary friend in real life :)</p>

<p>I want to make sure I&#39;m forthcoming and honest too.. so please know that I&#39;m still trying to understand some of the things you&#39;ve said. Evolution sounds great, it&#39;s the current best estimate for how life changes and adapts over time, for how WE got to where we are today. That sounds totally cool, and I&#39;d even go as far as to say that the universe as a whole is on some evolutionary timeline, as in, starting from point A, matter changes, energy transfers, time passes, stars are born, stars die, space expands.. all according to laws (physics) that may or may not change over time. </p>

<p>The part that I&#39;m skeptical about.. is the idea that we have/are a soul/sprit. That each of us somehow chose this life in some form of predestination, maybe even free will.. it sounds really nice, purposeful, sacred, esoteric, meaningful... but how does anyone know? </p>

<p>The whole idea of the afterlife (or next life), the idea that I&#39;m not my body, not my brain, not my personality. The idea that everything I&#39;ve EVER experienced in my entire life, was a kind of game, a test/trial to go through for the purpose of moving my/our soul up to the &quot;next level&quot;.. for the &quot;next trial&quot;..</p>

<p>These things are incredibly interesting to me.. I would love to hear your thoughts on this.. maybe you could shed light on where you think I am at, where you are at, why we are/appear different  from eachother, with regards to these thoughts and beliefs..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really glad you take an interest in this stuff man. It&#39;s truly powerful and liberating reading and learning about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a valid question to wonder where this kind of information comes from and I&#39;m glad you asked! I have done a lot of reading on these types of subjects because it truly fascinates me. I learned a lot about these esoteric topics by reading works by Edgar Cayce (extremely gifted man that lived from 1877-1945) he was able to lie down and go into meditational states and withdraw information from the akashic records (universal records that hold all wisdom, truth, and information, about anything and everything and anyone and everyone) while in these states he was able to be a medium for people to write down his concepts while under this trance. He was able to garner information on reincarnation, the true nature of reality, the laws of karma, our past lives and incarnations etc. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not the only one to do so and won&#39;t be the last either. There are a multitude of books on these subjects that are truly enlightening and freeing to yourself and your soul. I highly recommend you read some of these books, they will do you such a big favor and you will want to learn more. If you have time, check out these books sometime.</p>

<ul>
<li>Edgar Cayce Angels, archangels and the unseen forces</li>
<li>Conversations with God (all three books) author talks straight to God about different controversial topics</li>
<li>Seth material by Jane Roberts (she was able to be a medium for an highly intelligent entity named Seth who was able to provide a lot of esoteric answers to our world and ourselves) </li>
<li>Edgar Cayce on the Akashic Records</li>
<li>Journey of souls by Michael Newton. He documents work on how our souls chose to incarnate at this time at this place etc. how it feels to die, what you see and feel after death, talks about soul mates, the purpose of life etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all great books on these subjects and I HIGHLY suggest you read at least one! It is the most powerful material you can stumble across. It helps to keep an open mind with this stuff, a lot of people are ignorant and fast to jump to conclusions about these topics they have no understandings about.</p>

<p>In relation to our soul choosing to manifest here, your higher self (the total being of you and I) has chosen to manifest into this reality at this time for a specific purpose or several. Your soul chose everything about your current life before you were born. No one has memory of this at all unless you do a lot of meditation work. Everything from your parents, your birth place, your birth time, who you marry and meet in your life, when how and why you will die, certain life changing scenarios you experience in life, ALL HAPPEN FOR A REASON! There is no coincidence. Every person you meet in life has a gift to give you and you have a gift to give them. There are no chance encounters or meetings. </p>

<p>This all stems back to the fact that we are all one. We are literally God, manifested, experiencing himself, in us, through us, through millions of souls. Everything is God, and everything is a part of him. We are all fragments and shards of his consciousness. We are holy spiritual pure beings no matter how much &quot;evil&quot; we put into the world, or how much &quot;light&quot; we reflect to others. </p>

<p>A lot of these concepts piss people off, and rightly so, because we have all been lied to about who we are and what we are. Religion is a means of controlling and making you fear God our creator. This is not how it is supposed to be. We should all strive to be spiritual and come to our own answers and do our own thinking instead of relying on some religious institution to do it for us.</p>

<p>I really hope I answered your questions and I hope you read some of those books! If you have anymore questions feel free to ask :)</p>

<p>Peace and love friend </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is not ending... but we need to end our current systems of control and update it with something that properly handles human equality and managing earth&#39;s resources so that we all have a much better chance at finding happiness more often than not and live in an abundant and free society utilizing smart people (scientists and scholars, not politicians) who use the scientific method and peer review (not opinions and money) to find the best answers to a positive and productive society.</p>

<p>The earth is 4.543 billion years old... and it&#39;s not ending anytime soon... Like all other species (so far) we can easily go as fast as we came... we just have the opportunity to last a lot longer and possibly extend our reach past our home planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks OP for saying this.</p>

<p>Getting tired of the circle jerk going on in people&#39;s minds that everything is a conspiracy and the world &quot;will end this time&quot;</p>

<p>No. It won&#39;t. I remember first getting sucked into the rabbit hole and it took over my happiness and peacefulness. Conspiracies are a great way to ruin your sense of happiness.</p>

<p>While the world can suck and evil people do evil things, the light always wins and there will be no &quot;world ending&quot; scenarios.</p>

<p>I think people just hate the way life is or their life is so they look at small problems and try to make it fit their world view of crashing and burning so we can get a reset.</p>

<p>Tough shit guys, quit looking for disasters to replace what we have created. We created this fucking mess, we need to get ourselves out of it instead of circle jerking each other off on this whole Armageddon worlds ending bullshit. Man the fuck up and take some responsibility guys</p>

<p>You see because although we kind of &#39;want the world to collapse&#39;, of course we know it won&#39;t because it <em>hasn&#39;t yet</em>.  But we do get to complain because if we don&#39;t, then we won&#39;t be coming up with ways to ultimately escape from it for ourselves, like for example living off the grid or prepping; or if that&#39;s not your taste, creating our own damned internet and not letting the government in; or creating web apps that disintermediate the shitheads who got us to this point; agorism and diy ethic</p>

<p>Do you think that society is just going to keep going? The same way it always has? This shit is corrupt! I&#39;ve always thought I wouldn&#39;t live a long life (That&#39;s me listening to my instincts again) and that&#39;s fine because this shit is beyond fucked up!</p>

<p>I would actually love to hear your side of this story on where you see our society going? This rant got side tracked and I don&#39;t even know what we are fighting about. </p>

<p>Nothing can be achieved if we don&#39;t get there all together, and I mean every fucking human being. Poor to rich, white to black, every fucking one of us...</p>

<p>Like I said, you and the other guy might be right. All Im saying is that you guys havent said anything substantiative.

You came in and stood up for him by doing nearly the exact thing tho I will admit that you are a lot more intelligent than him.

<p>Im still confused how you can ask me why Im calling you vague when you literally start your comment with that sentence. Like I said, believe what you want, but dont pretend any of what youre saying is more than emotional. </p>

<p>I didnt say everything was good, I said things are shitty but also good, as it always has been. But also theyre better than it used to be. Thats just a fact, by any measure. </p>

<p>Again, how can anyone take you seriously when youre doing the exact same thing that this argument was started over:  the smug &quot;insider&quot; conspiracy nut character. Anybody that doesnt agree with you is a sheep or dumb or uninformed or just willingly being blissfuly ignorant and you are one of the few thats seeing the &quot;truth&quot; and the &quot;signs&quot; that the world is ending. Its fucking hilariously sad. Again, I dont know how clear I have to be:  There is bad in this world, but there is also good. We just disagree that the world is going to end or that theres some crazy massive event coming. That doesnt mean Im ignoring all the terrible things in the world, it just means Im also not ignoring all the GOOD things in this world and being fucking cynical like you. </p>

<p>If you think the world is ending or whatever, what are you doing to prepare? Do you have a bunker? Food? Guns? Lets say you are right. Lemme know how I can prepare</p>

<p>A large majority of people believe in alien life. Not everyone believes in the conspiratorial narrative of suppressed alien visitors/contact, which is what makes us look crazy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would love to know what conspiracies resonate with you? </p>

<p>Resonate with me? All of em. I think conspiracies are inevitable in society and the power structure. How many do I believe? The basic ones about the Fed, JFK, planned obsolesence and the withholding of better technology, etc</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You mean it isnt hard to take a cynical view of the world when you dont put it into context. But go on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Weather like nothing seen before all over the globe for one, </p>

<p>Nothing seen by modern humans not only because of new better technology but lack of historical data and again, context. </p>

<p>Nothing new shes not the first. </p>

<p>Federal Reserve controlling our money supply, when our own government has the ability to print the country&#39;s money, </p>

<p>The 2nd part isnt new, but I actually agree with the overall sentiment here </p>

<blockquote>
<p>NWO where rothchild himself admitted it he wants one world government and rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether or not this means the world is going to shit depends on whether or not you agree with 1 global government. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Satanism is on the rise, have you watched the Gotthard Tunnel Opening Ceremony? It&#39;s fucked up. etc etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You got any stats there? I doubt Satanism is on the rise any more than youd expect with the population increase. When it comes to that tunnel opening, Im going to agree with you for arguments sake, and then point out that thats only 1 instance. And again, it being a sign of the end of the world is up to interpretation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But really man I do come here for the truth, and to debate and discuss. So lets start over shall we?</p>

<p>Then dont be mad when people point out that youre not presenting any more than vague assertions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah your one of those people that nit-picks/breaks down the comments, Okay. Well to me resonating with something means being in tune with it, so you can&#39;t have all conspiracies resonate with you. I certainly don&#39;t. Resonate = believe IMO. So with all the corruption and vileness in the world you want it to keep going the way it is? My cynical view is made up from my research not emotional. I wish it wasn&#39;t that way but that is how the world. Corruption is every where and you have to lie and cheat to even be in the game.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t mad about Clinton and all the other shit yet, then you&#39;re no help to the solution/revolution. Do you see that? You have to care about every single person in the world, you can&#39;t say &quot;Well this doesn&#39;t effect my day-to-day life so LaLaLa&quot;. </p>

<p>I look at Satanic symbolism this way:</p>

<p>If you were apart of a Satanic cult and were involved in a Satanic ritual. You&#39;re not actually doing anything in the ceremony except spectating and looking fly with your nice tailored satanic robe. Would you consider that you then took part in a Satanic ritual? Yes/No? Now take that same ritual and broadcast it on TV. People watch, but are only spectating, did they take part in the ritual then? That is why they put satanic symbolism and rituals into entertainment and things like opening ceremonies. </p>

We are all here in the conspiracy sub, so its a given that we are &quot;insiders&quot; but theres a certain character type that Miscreant fit to a tee, and I can only hope you dont follow him. Its ok to believe what he believes, but dont present vague emotions like he did and try to pretend youre making a rational argument.

I dont know how old you are, hopefully young because it sucks when people reach adulthood with your mentality. Just read your comments and try to deny everything Ive said here about you. You sound like every doomsday predictor that Ive ever heard. Your knowledge is the best, your intuition is the best, youre seeing patterns that no one else sees and if they see it they dont wanna see it cuz theyre dumb or blissfully ignorant, etc etc. Youre a cliche at this point. And I love how every idiots last resort nowadays is to call someone a troll if theyre disagreeing with them. Again, grow the fuck up. If you interracted with people in real life youd realize its not an echo chamber like youre accustomed to online, people disagree with you, people call you on your bullshit when youre clearly an idiot which you are, theyre not &quot;trolls.&quot; Again, Im just upset that Ive heard/read your comments a billion times before at this point it seems like copypasta.

<p>Yeaah, no. It doesnt. Being a dick all the times makes you a dick. Just like you being an idiot all the time makes you an idiot. If anyone looks into my post history its only because they cant argue the point at hand and they are looking for some outside information to attack my character instead of my argument. </p>

<p>But again putting that aside and discussing just the topic at hand, you dont NEED a reason to answer me but there are several reasons why you could want to answer me. 1 is because if you have any information to back up your argument, why not present it so I can realize if I was wrong? 2 is because if you have info that could prove me wrong why not present it and make me look like an idiot? I mean I could go on and on giving you reasons, but I agree you dont necessarilt have to answer me. But not answering kinda does prove me right </p>

When you are questioned you resort to sarcasm, When your sarcasm doesnt work, you resort to being a douche, when that doesnt work you just call me a troll and be condescendingly nice.
