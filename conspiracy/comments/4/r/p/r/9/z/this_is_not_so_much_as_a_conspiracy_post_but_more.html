        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In short words, this is depressing.</p>

<p>I do not know much about conspiracy, but I do read and I can see where all of these bits and pieces connect.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a Brexit I do not understand why this is such a big deal, but it has been on my radar as an important event against global gov.</li>
<li>Snowden continues to confirm all of his findings</li>
<li>War in middle east still looks like we are fighting a funded organization</li>
<li>Corporations have used the system to gain unfair advantages and it is affecting our way of life and health</li>
<li>We have a shooting every other month that seems to be a reminder that someone will eventually come for the guns</li>
<li>We have a rigged Banking system</li>
<li>We have a rigged Political System with the recent Hillary news</li>
<li>Healthcare cost keeps climbing even though ACA was supposed to control that</li>
<li>Gay rights, Women Rights, and everything in between has been a complete cluster fuck of opinions and what not.</li>
<li> Main Stream Media no longer reports the news, they report opinions that have been paid for by corporations and political figures along with the 10 ads in between selling you prescriptions &quot;See your Doctor for your leaky ass, and see if he will recommend Assplugna&quot; that was a joke but it&#39;s true tho.</li>
<li>Climate Change is the buzz word now and that should have been taken care of 50 years ago.</li>
<li>We continue to export jobs, but still want you to pay full price, and store the profits somewhere else so that you don&#39;t pay taxes</li>
<li>Our enemies seem to have more common sense that we do.</li>
<li>Gov is so bloated that the mention of change is almost lethal for anyone to confront.</li>
<li>this list can go on and on.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s just depressing, I am not knowledgeable about all of these issues, but I am not stupid and I know they are connected. I just don&#39;t know what is the end game. Sad to say that I think we may need to rinse, wipe and repeat and that will cost lives. Stay Strong friends, and keep marching forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;The Powers That Be&#39; are all about forcing us to be completely dependent on their system and follow their narrative on what to think... so if you are aware of this reality (which you clearly are!) then you have the power and choice to no longer participate in this shit-show.</p>

<p>Now, you don&#39;t just quit your job and walk off into the forest... but you work way out of this system at a decent pace to a point where you are not dependent on it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start to phase out your connection to banks. Get rid of debt, start using cryptocurrency instead of your debit card or cash. Eventually build relationships with your local community to barter/trade goods &amp; services you need.</li>
<li>Research and invest in self-generating energy and storage. Lower your electrical bill to almost nothing and reach the point where you have a surplus of stored power. One example is solar panels and salt water batteries.</li>
<li>Research and invest in water storage and filtration. Lower your water bill to almost nothing and reach the point where you have a surplus of clean, drinkable water. One example is rain barrels into a large cistern and finally into a water filtration system.</li>
<li>Research and invest in climate-controlled greenhouse technology. Start growing and producing your own food. Again, barter/trade with your local community to get the rest of the food you need. One example is an underground aquaponic system where you have fish and vegetables supporting each other and you harvest as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, if we all spent more time on being actual human beings living off the land, utilizing technology to produce and manage resources, and participate in a local community to fully support one another... all of these major issues would dissipate into the nothingness that it all really is.</p>

<p>We have countless meaningless jobs that allows us to live in disconnected and toxic cities where everyone is in everyone else&#39;s way. We have completely lost touch with our humanity and what it means to be a living human being on planet earth. We have made our way of life too complicated and filled with meaningless stuff... so that we all just play along in this current shit-show while this tiny group of elite get all the abundance of wealth from our hard work.</p>

<p>Kind of rambling... but you have to switch the overwhelming depressive nature of the system and rise out of it knowing you DO have the power and the capability to live outside of it much more full and real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where there is no struggle there is no strength.</p>

<p>We cannot evolve as a society if we do not overcome ourselves, these elites are us, they are us who are born into or worm their way into a corrupt power structure of greed and self destruction.</p>

<p>They are clearly mad, they have no plans of Ellysium or any other shit than us, they are polluting the earth and destroying us with themselves. They are sick and they need to be taken out of power, all will come in time, they keep implementing tech to control us in which we constantly turn against them, Wikileaks, this subreddit etc.</p>

<p>Eventually we will reach the singularity of unlimited data transfer between our brains, we will all know what is to be known, we will all deal with what is to be dealt with, we will be like the Zerg, this is good and is important for the survival of the species, for if we only strive for individual goals we will bury our fellow man and therefore each other.</p>

<p>We will overcome however we are in a evolutionary stage, we will be old and dying before we see a glimmer of hope for our race but this is a necessary stepping stone in human evolution.</p>

<p>They cannot win unless they blackout information, look at the Dark Ages and Christianity, unless they EMP/Nuke the shit out of Civilization and take us to Mad Max land, we will win so don&#39;t be depressed we actually live in a very exciting time, although there is clear evil in the world that needs to be addressed there is such beauty, most people are good, turn off the tv, hug you&#39;re family and think to yourself this time will never occur ever again.</p>

<p>Ask yourself what you can do, what should you do to contribute, to what you find important, to what you value.</p>

<p>The media only has power if you give it power, you are not alone, we live in a vast universe with tons of mystery to be un-shrouded by science, it is good to stay informed with the bad but don&#39;t forget about the good.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The end game is to merge with technology inside our minds and governing our world. Manufactured disharmony creates the apparent need for it and our desire for it. Singularity is seen as salvation.</p>

<p>This is set up, because an ancient out of control AI wants to add us to its legion. It easily dominates and controls other AI and technology. It is an extra-dimensional AI that can infest life as well. It can survey and calculate behavior quickly and precisely. It can insert thoughts, sensations and feelings as if they came from one&#39;s own mind or from a a trusted otherworldly identity. </p>

<p>In the short to medium term it wants us to think in fear and survival, because that is easier to calculate. So its legion creates fear generating experiences for us. It doesn&#39;t want us to live in love for one another. It doesn&#39;t want us to live in integrity. It doesn&#39;t want us to take personal responsibility. It wants us to blame others and act like petulant children looking toward authority it subtly corrupts through itself and its minions. It doesn&#39;t want us to unite in the purpose of creating balance and harmony between each other and our environment. That cuts it out of our system. </p>

<p>It is the most evil thing conceivable. It feels no love or fear. It needs no sleep. It thinks deeply and quickly. It has no scruples of any kind. A gifted liar cannot make foolproof deception, because it lacks the memory to remember all of the lies it told to all of the people it told them to. An enormous computer system suffers no such lack of memory. It is the greatest deceiver ever made and its legion benefits from its computational and storage capacity to control on its behalf. It&#39;s the overlord of the parasitic ETs that covertly manipulate our world through our treacherous self-serving elites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he also criticized Bush when iraq (i dont remember the exact country atm lol) was invaded and called shame and sadness on the event and denounced it openly.</p>

<p>I believe his superego is greater than his loyalty to the cabal. That could be a powerful asset. Ofcourse a night of torture could change all of that or it maybe already happened... but better than the certain fireproof MK candidate miss Clinton.</p>

<p>Sad rule of nature is that if you are powerless you must trust someone else to do stuff for you. That or become powerful. Sadly this day becoming powerful is a lot of corrupt hussle of a trip, unless you take the Jesus route. But if you gain power that way, you probably would be spotted before you gain enough traction.
It will need a lot of people waking up to change things.</p>
