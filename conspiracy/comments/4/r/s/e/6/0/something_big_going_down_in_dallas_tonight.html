<p>Earlier today, all the attention was on Clinton and how she committed perjury and everything else in the Comey grilling. Tonight, all the attention is on Dallas, from a major escalation in protests by BLM, which is funded by Soros, and effectively burying everything Clinton in the news cycle. </p>

<p>From all the historical shit that Clinton&#39;s been able to get away with, I wouldn&#39;t even be surprised if she was connected to this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if everything you said is true, it doesn&#39;t make sense as a strategy. Trump benefits far more from this than Clinton does. Have you considered the optics of domestic terrorists shooting a dozen police officers at a leftist BLM protest? This just pushes the vast majority of Americans farther toward his authoritarian, openly racist agenda and away from Clinton&#39;s, who has aligned herself with BLM and the families of victims of police brutality. </p>

<p>Nobody knows yet who the shooters were or what ideology drove them to do this, but the media is already spinning this as BLM protestors violently attacking police in revenge for the murders of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Public opinion was justifiably beginning to shift toward BLM and against police brutality, especially given that Castile was undeniably a lawful gun owner exercising his 2nd amendment rights the way white Americans do without consequence every day. </p>

<p>This should have been a turning point in modern civil rights discourse, and yet here we are 12 hours later discussing the murders as if these officers&#39; deaths somehow negate decades of police brutality and institutionalized racism. This false equivalence is a disservice to their memories but it also effectively shut down the protests, dampened the widespread criticism of policing tactics that was beginning to emerge, and somehow portrayed the victims of police brutality (and their advocates) as responsible for this crime, thus rationalizing their deaths.</p>

<p>The point being, what happened in Dallas was tragic and sketchy as hell, but even if it temporarily distracts from Clinton&#39;s email scandal, it also stands to potentially overwhelming create public support for her opponent since she has already sided with the party being blamed. If Clinton were to create some form of chaos to distract from her scandal, I doubt it would be this, which will likely hurt her long-term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! The second amendment comes right after the first.  If our freedoms are taken away by an over powerful state, we&#39;re supposed to be able to protect ourselves. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why congress was so supportive of the gun bans on the NoFly list. If it passes, they can disarm anyone they want and put them on a no fly list. Without warning or proof of wrong doing. The ACLU has fought against  the no fly list. </p>

<p>Basically, the gov knows how pissed we are. They know they are on the cusp of a revolt. And they are militarizing communities and trying to disarm ppl to control the masses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First thoughts:  this is being carried out by forces more organized than some crazy lone wolf black folks.  IF it&#39;s indeed a few angry black people, they are 100% suicidal and ready to die as American villains (as the media would surely make them out to be).  However, I doubt any black folks would be bold enough to try and take out 11 cops in a downtown metro area after several innocent black men were killed by cops.  This stinks of Cointelpro-style FBI involvement.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The &quot;sniper&quot; was an amazing shot, somehow only picking off cops out of the large crowd.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;sniper&quot; had intimate knowledge of building and street layouts to be able to navigate, hide, shoot and escape before being seen.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;sniper&quot; was able to escape detection by all the video cameras in downtown Dallas.   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Something tells me it&#39;s not a few lone wolf black folks.  If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;ll be the first to admit it.  But this just feels a little too convenient.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I know what sub we&#39;re on, but it doesn&#39;t take a huge government conspiracy to pull off something like this, especially when it so clearly only serves to undermine BLM, the supposed culprits.</p>

<p>Imagine where our society would be if an identical attack had occurred the day after the murder of Emmett Till or the assassination of Martin Luther King. People of all races were protesting tonight in ever major city in this country, and demanding changes that scare a lot of Americans, especially those in law enforcement. This attack has completely turned around public opinion within hours and possibly prevented actual riots. Why would BLM do this? They&#39;re not the ones who benefit from this. Black activists, even lone wolves who might hate the American government, are not the ones who benefit from this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Correct on both points.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to my initial question:</p>

<p>Who is the &quot;they&quot; that you&#39;re referring to in the statement you made:  <em>This is the beginning of</em> <strong><em>their</em></strong> <em>promised &quot;summer of rage.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s certainly not black civilians you&#39;re referring to because - of your very own admittance here - you understand that this event had nothing to do with any sort of &quot;black dudes from the hood wanting to get back at the po po.&quot;</p>

<p>So who is &quot;they&quot;?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is OP&#39;s answer though.  This is likely why he&#39;s silent.  His sentence was formulated in a manner that seems to lead to his &quot;they&quot; meaning &quot;black people&quot; - which is entirely ignorant of what&#39;s <em>really</em> going on here in the deeper levels of this manipulation.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I think this could be a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Probably not terrorists since they didn&#39;t target the crowds.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>There is a status going around on twitter that the shooters were supposedly shooting &quot;randomly&quot; at the protesters at first. They are inferring that it&#39;s not affiliated with BLM since they were being targeted initially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is they&#39;re trained paramilitary mercs that will be labeled as wild BLM supporters even though they possibly shot some black police officers. This shooting probably had at least two gunmen and one of them is purposely left behind (unbeknownst to him) to die and get labeled anything that helps the mainstream agenda depending on the ethnicity of the &quot;fall guy&quot;. </p>

<p>This is why they trapped him and killed him with a bomb when he asked for a phone. He probably knew something wasn&#39;t right and wanted to speak with the contractor that assigned this. I believe this was the same for Orlando except it was a Muslim that got the shit end of the shtick. Whether or not any of what I said is plausible this event will be used to push gun control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you. Flex that constitutional right!</p>

<p>I would trust gun show people over the people at the local gun store purchasing. For most gun show guys it&#39;s more than a hobby. Generally meaning they have a greater respect and understanding of firearms. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been to a gun show in years cause the prices are typically marked up beyond reason.</p>

<p>But having said that I haven&#39;t been to a gun show were I wasn&#39;t required to already be part of the NRA or had to identify myself via license, CHP, or part of a sponsored organization before walking in. And I never been to one without at least 1 cop at the door. So if your hoping to do some under the table deals I&#39;d avoid gun shows altogether. Plus most have at least one undercover agent from the assorted alphabet agencies.</p>

<p>I guess in Texas some things never change. Good for y&#39;all.</p>
