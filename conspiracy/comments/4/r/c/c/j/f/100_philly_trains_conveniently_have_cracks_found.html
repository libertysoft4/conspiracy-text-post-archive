        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Very suspicious these cars are found to have cracks a couple weeks before the convention. This significantly prohibits bernie supporters from getting to the convention, most of whom will be traveling by train, and are expected to protest like never before. Additionally, This is a great deterrent that  prevents people from coming to philly in the first place. Anyone staying in the city where the hotels are unbelievably expensive will likely be hillary supporters and won&#39;t need the train. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More importantly, once people are IN Philly, they will have to rely on surface streets to get around. Meaning there will be more people on the streets. Meaning it will be easier for the media to call EVERYONE a &#39;rioter&#39; while the fascists gas and beat them all indiscriminately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thought also.  They did this in Baltimore with the Freddy Grey protests, and when it actually turned into a riot (more or less) was when all the police kicked everyone off (mainly the kids leaving from school) of public transportation in Mondawmin to &quot;contain&quot; the problem.  Getting harassed off of a public bus or school bus by riot police when all you want to do is go home, is not helping the situation and it pretty much created one.  Especially when there is so much hatred of the police there. 
This would be my possible thought with philly, too many people being frustrated about keeping their jobs, trying to get home, dealing with fighting the crowd and then they get demonized by police/media as rioters (like the baltimore school kids) to the point that they get pissed off because the police are treating them as an enemy and not a customer with a complaint against one of Philly&#39;s relied on forms for daily commute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a DIRECT connection there, but it&#39;s insane that they would drop such a significant portion of their trains from service with less than 24 hours notice.  Commuters rely on those trains and there really isn&#39;t an alternative because city parking is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s more likely is that this was a strategic move to highlight need for money at a time when Philadelphia is going to be in the spotlight.  And it may also stop rail workers from potentially striking.</p>

<p>They&#39;re going to have to turn this around quick.  They recently bought a fleet from a south korean manufacturer, but this is their impetus to complete that transition.  SEPTA has been trying to privatize for a long time (along with the Gas utility).  There&#39;s no way they have the funds to put these trains back in service.  Their fiscal year literally JUST started on July 1 and now they&#39;re going to have to scramble to find money.</p>

<p>This is exactly what the investors were waiting for.  They&#39;re going to have to find a big chunk of change this week and the state will probably only grudgingly pay a portion of it.  Investors love infrastructure projects because people will always take the train and the state will always throw cash in.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The solution is also still unclear. SEPTA will try an interim fix by welding the beams, but is considering the possibility all the equalizer beams will need to be replaced. If a temporary fix is not feasible, he said, disruptions could affect the Democratic National Convention, which begins July 25. On a positive note, he anticipated that most of the conventioneers would be riding the subway, not the regional rail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subway services the inner city where hotel rooms are crazy expensive. The issue isn&#39;t for the conventioneers, it&#39;s the protesters. Most of the protesters will likely stay outside the city where it is much cheaper and the regional rail is the best way to get in. Stifled mass transit means less protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have inspected many different vehicles and equipment at my last job. Usually ground support equipment such as deicers, cargo loaders, scissor lifts, and manlifts. </p>

<p>In other aspects I did bucket trucks, digger derricks, cranes, and sometimes rail cars or rail division power utility equipment. </p>

<p>From the fellow inspectors I know that have done rail in philly they are not just coming up with this right now to make shit for Bernie supporters harder. Its because they feel its unsafe. </p>

<p>Not a Bernie supporter myself, but I served 7 years in the nations military defending your freedom to assemble. I won&#39;t be that asshole that says bad shit cause honestly I just want to watch the world burn now. </p>

<p>My generation has no more of a hope then a fart in a fan factory at making a difference so might as well go out with a bang. </p>

<p>Hillary will win the oval office we both know that. Its the way its going to be. No amount of bitching or recounts will change that. Trump is just the other side of the shitty coin we have. </p>

<p>Bernie wants to play shit nice and not be that glowing beacon for the media like Trump is. Let&#39;s face it all of it is a shitshow made to distract us. The president doesn&#39;t have power to do shit anyways. All those things they say are nothing unless Congress gives the go ahead. </p>

<p>You want shit to change? Get rid of all the congress and redo all the laws of contributions to be monitored by multiple committees that take a percentage for public works in the districts they represent. </p>

<p>Also give them state funded housing in the districts they represent. Living right next to the people that voted for them. No more bullshit. We get people that will represent us and believe in us so much they will live next to us. </p>

<p>Otherwise nothing will change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya.. but only if your agenda is to protest the corruptness of the election. And not the alleged BLM agenda of trying to provoke martial law. It should be less protest and more of a complete domination of the convention while following it&#39;s rules. Protests don&#39;t effect much change.</p>

<p>But that means the Republican convention should be off limits to honest Bernie supporters. Trump was elected by the people while the full power of the establishment was against him.</p>

<p>I live in Philly, have been taking SEPTA for almost 20 years and this has NEVER happened. They have depots full of mechanics where the trains, buses and trolleys go DAILY. It would be insane to tell me the cars aren&#39;t inspected at least monthly. </p>

<p>Still, it is too far from the time the DNC is supposed to take place, so I think <a href="/u/know_comment">/u/know_comment</a> is a bit more on track.... Septa wil certainly find a way to maintain ridership despite the loss in cars.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also the 2nd most vacationed month of the year.  Half the people in the city are &quot;down the shore&quot;.  I can&#39;t imagine this wasn&#39;t something that had been somewhat planned out by at least a few parties.</p>

<p>What if they&#39;re taking the trains away to..add something to them. I think 30th street station is due for an upgrade. Then, tsa in our train stations, to protect us from the home grown lone wolf. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Riders ARE going to be down this week.  About 1/3 of commuters won&#39;t be able to make their trains- especially those at the inbetween stations on the regional rail.  This is going to seriously impact people and will leave a dent in productivity at city-based companies.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also the 2nd most vacationed month of the year.  Half the people in the city are &quot;down the shore&quot;.  I can&#39;t imagine this wasn&#39;t something that had been somewhat planned out by at least a few parties.</p>
