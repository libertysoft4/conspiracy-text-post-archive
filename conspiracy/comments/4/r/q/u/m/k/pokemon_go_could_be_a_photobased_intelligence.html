        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ok, so this idea hit me earlier. i have no proof or anything like that, its just a crazy (or maybe not so crazy) conspiracy theory I want to share with those of you who like to hear them.</p>

<p>a little background info:</p>

<p>Pokemon (roughly translated as &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;) is an <strong>INSANELY</strong> popular Intellectual Property depicted through cartoons and several generations of video games, where in the main characters or game player collects small, cute monsters who have super powers to use them in pokemon battles at an Arena. </p>

<p>the new &quot;Pokemon Go&quot; game for Android and Ios devices released yesterday and is already #1 on the stores. It is an augmented reality game. players see a map of their neighborhood, with pokemon icons on a map. in order to &quot;collect&quot; the pokemon, players must go to the location, find the pokemon by pointing their camera around until they see the pokemon on their screen (with actual real life landscape in the background) , point their camera at it and <em>take a picture</em>.</p>

<p>is this really necessary? why couldn&#39;t the player just go to the location, and the game verify their location through GPS? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_hQ3Kg68To">here</a> is a clip of gameplay to give some idea of how it works and what it looks like.</p>

<p>Obviously intelligence agencies have gained a lot of info from google maps and its street view, but this data was collected easily with driving cars. intel agencies may see google maps and street view as just an outline or a skeleton of the whole picture. getting more data, particularly that off the street and <em>inside buildings</em>, requires tons of man hours and foot work. a logistical nightmare. </p>

<p>enter Pokemon GO, where if you are an intel agency and you want photos of the inside of a home or business, you just spawn desirable pokemon or related objects there, and let totally unaware and distracted citizens take the photos for you, with devices they paid for, and those citizens pay for the experience. </p>

<p>imagine all these photos going back to some database (with the augmented Pokemon removed obviously. all these photos are probably GPS tagged, as well as having the phones internal gyro embed x/y/z orientation of the camera angle in the phone. these photos could be put together, much like google street view. </p>

<p>(<em>edit</em>): as <a href="/u/egypturnash">/u/egypturnash</a> pointed out Pokemon GO is made by Niantic Inc, a company &quot;formerly&quot; part of Google. Niantec&#39;s previous title was called Ingress, which used similar gameplay elements involving players traveling to locations on foot, and taking photos. interestingly, Ingress also sometimes required users to walk specific paths to gain powerups. this data could have been used to improve google map data, for example, time required to walk from point A to point B. </p>

<p><a href="https://pando.com/2012/11/19/googles-ingress-is-more-than-a-game-its-a-potential-data-exploitation-disaster/">here is an interesting article on Ingress</a> it looks to me like Ingress was basically successful, but likely did not have as many users as needed to collect the kind of data they want, so they bought licensing for Pokemon to basically make Ingress 2.0</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they dont have to process all the data. just what they need, when they need it. think about it like google maps. you have the whole worlds worth of photos accessible to you. have you looked through them all? im sure not. but you still likely find google maps and street view very useful...because when you want to see exactly where a store or something is, you can look it up, and even see what the building looks like. </p>

<p>imagine some protest going on, something like occupy wall street, but on a college campus or something. operatives could pull up photos of the area to best assess how and where to deploy personnel to disperse the protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pokemon is a huge franchise. this is not some indie game. its a big corporation. i just had a glance at the Terms of Service for the game. I am no lawyer, but im pretty sure it says they can use your photos. </p>

<p>the trend in general in the world, and particularly with phone apps, is by using the apps, you generally give away the rights to a bunch of your personal info, which is often sold to advertising agencies and the like. that may be the scope of their &quot;nefarious&quot; intentions, which alone isnt <em>that</em> bad, but like you said, NSA would be drooling over the data, and would likely bribe and/or blackmail and/or court order that data, or they would just take it without anyone being able to do anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the first thing people should do is look at the TOS for the game. I would fucking bet dollars to donuts that the TOS says that the game creators have the rights to use your photos taken with the game and use them or sell them for any reason. (edit: i looked it up, they do. who isnt surprised?)</p>

<p>the creators would likely look to sell those photos and/or metadata related to the photos to other corporations or the government. if the telcom companies were in on the conspiracy (and we already know they cooperate with the government) they could easily download photos off of a phone and transmit them to a data storage center. these transfers might not effect the customers data plan usage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s built by Niantic Labs, a subsidiary of Google previously responsible for &quot;Ingress&quot;. Which was in part an attempt to get people to vastly improve Google Maps&#39; data without realizing they were doing that - I am too lazy to dig it up but I recall reading articles about Ingress where they admitted to that being one of their motivations. Digging through the many articles referenced in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niantic,_Inc.">Wikipedia&#39;s entry on Niantic</a> may source a quote on that.</p>

<p>(This bit of history also explains why you may be seeing people posting shots of Pokestops that are really not kid-appropriate - they grabbed the list of points of interest generated by Ingress players and didn&#39;t bother filtering out inappropriate locations like a gay bar described as &quot;a maze of mirrors and glory holes&quot;.)</p>

<p>pothead pokemon game player/weed dealer &quot;DUUUUDE! check it out! a mewtwo spawned in our living room. woah, I dont believe it. im so high right now. look! its right on the coffee table, next to our mountain of weed...hahaha! thats hilarious, im gonna take the photo and capture him.&quot; </p>

<p>boom. DEA has evidence of drug dealing. they didnt even need a warrant to search, because you willingly gave the rights to use those photos for &quot;any&quot; reason according to the ToS. </p>

<p>or if they dont think that evidence will hold up in court, doesnt matter. they now KNOW that person deals, and can reverse engineer evidence against them...they know who to track, etc.</p>

<p>also, while most of them may be useless filler, the potential exists for the game creators to just put a rare/desirable pokemon right on top of whatever they want a picture of. agents could view that photo, then adjust the spawn data for that pokemon to get a better angle that they want. they flying pokemon seem to get good pictures. </p>

<p>imagine if all the sudden it was discovered that say, everyone wanted a charizard because it has a great attack power, and everyone seemed to be getting their charizards by taking pictures around <em>gun stores</em>. hmmmm. or particular desirable pokemon always seem to spawn at abortion clinics/planned parenthood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk about the pictures thing, Im sure those will be collected as well based on that unnerving privacy policy. But I feel like the biggest thing to be aware of with this is the GPS feature. Think about it, the game encourages you to &quot;always stay alert&quot; so if you leave it running while going about your day, after a while your movements can be tracked/logged to start picking up on patterns &amp; even predicting where you&#39;ll be throughout the day based on habits. Imagine that info in the wrong hands.</p>

<p>&quot;in order to &quot;collect&quot; the pokemon, players must go to the location, find the pokemon by pointing their camera around until they see the pokemon on their screen (with actual real life landscape in the background) , point their camera at it and take a picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AR is a selling point of the game. its the SOOO COOL reason they buy it and play it. </p>

<p>if you are paranoid about AR in POGO, you probably shouldnt play POGO at all. probably 99% of players use AR and dont even think about stuff like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>locations as well as your home. for example if they suspect someone is say, dealing large amounts of pot...they spawn a powerful pokemon....IN THEIR LIVING ROOM. </p>

<p>pothead pokemon game player/weed dealer &quot;DUUUUDE! check it out! a mewtwo spawned in our living room. woah, I dont believe it. im so high right now. look! its right on the coffee table, next to our mountain of weed...hahaha! thats hilarious, im gonna take the photo and capture him.&quot; </p>

<p>boom. DEA has evidence of drug dealing. they didnt even need a warrant to search, because you willingly gave the rights to use those photos for &quot;any&quot; reason according to the ToS. </p>

<p>or if they dont think that evidence will hold up in court, doesnt matter. they now KNOW that person deals, and can reverse engineer evidence against them...they know who to track, etc.</p>
