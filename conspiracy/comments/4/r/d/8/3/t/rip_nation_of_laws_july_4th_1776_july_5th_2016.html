    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing this analogy but if you read the law regarding speeding it doesnt say that going over the speed limit is against the law only that it is prima fascia (on its face looks like you are guilty) evidence that you are not acting in a reasonable and prudent manner which they equate &quot;speeding&quot; to. There are lots of times you could appear to be &quot;speeding&quot; and going 2x the number on the sign but still be acting in a reasonable and prudent manner and not hitting all of the points nessasary to constitute a speeding charge and thus be innocent. Especially if conditions on the roadway make going the posted speed limit and under more dangerous than going over it. For instance if someone is dying in you back seat and you are going to the hospital to save them, then going the posted speed is much less reasonable and prudent as someone could die on the way thus making it acceptable to speed. Or if there is a fire in the roadway and you must go faster than the posted speed to get to safety no one will charge you for acting appropriately. Unless you are unable to keep control over the car  and not acting in a reasonable and prudent manner given the conditions of the roadway it becomes hard to prove that you were actually hitting all the points for a speeding charge to be valid. So while I agree that this is fucked up if you were to hire a decent lawyer you could also get out of a speeding charge on a similar technicality. The laws are set up to benefit the rich and thus there is a way out of most of them. If you can afford it you can talk your way out of anything. We just cant afford to fight it at the bottom so we get charged with things at a disproportionate rate </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of that sentiment.  The problem is it&#39;s a reiteration of &quot;It&#39;s somebody else&#39;s problem&quot; - expecting that some external party will fix the things that obviously need fixing.  Reality doesn&#39;t work like that. </p>

<p>In times past people coalesced their efforts in a contract with the understanding that if the contract is broken or fails to satisfy those who agreed to it, then the contract can be discarded.  And it still works like that, today.  Social contracts are no different.</p>

<p>If the terms of the social contract is such that it&#39;s difficult to remove yourself from it, you can certainly remove yourself from parts of it, by simply not engaging in the machinery.  Limit your engagement with The Machine.  (And if you have to engage, be Slack, as this seems to be the most efficient use of energy in a chaotic, unpredictable, or hostile environment.)</p>

<p>Finally, regardless of who is elected, he or she is not likely to be putting food on your table.  That&#39;s always been your responsibility. It&#39;s no different.  If you want the comfort of a stronger network, then go find it.  The current system has demonstrated its nature.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t stress it.  It&#39;s inevitable that humanity will figure out that Hierarchical systems are Bad Design.  It&#39;s a flawed Hero Narrative, where the Heroes - the nodes in the hierarchy - can be coerced, bought, wrong, incompetent, etc.  We&#39;re brought up to believe in authority but this is just ceding decision making to another.  It never works.  Its flaws are well known and well understood.  </p>

<p>The collapse of The Hero System is inevitable and a Good Thing.  It&#39;s time we use other models that don&#39;t run into these design flaws.  Like the scientific method, for instance.  </p>

<p>Whenever revolutions have taken place, people didn&#39;t run around wondering &quot;who&#39;s going to do the revolting&quot;. A boiling point is reached and then everything pops.</p>

<p>If nothing is happening, it&#39;s because there&#39;s still some ways to it.</p>

<p>Problem is, we, as individuals, have a bottom up view and only see the micro-level interactions and we&#39;re always in a hurry. If you step back for the macro level, things look a bit different.</p>

<p>On the macro level, things are very different from just a decade ago. Politicians and corruption hasn&#39;t increased much in this time. But the peoples awareness of it has grown exponentially.</p>

<p>In it, there is a quaint scene, very nostalgic in fact, where  Morgan Freeman is telling Brad Pitt (in a hushed voice) that he knows someone in the federal government who can get the serial killer&#39;s library book check-out records. In response, Brad Pitt goes apoplectic, loudly admonishing Freeman&#39;s character for even considering the violation of the suspect&#39;s rights even if he is believed to be responsible for several very grisly murders.</p>
