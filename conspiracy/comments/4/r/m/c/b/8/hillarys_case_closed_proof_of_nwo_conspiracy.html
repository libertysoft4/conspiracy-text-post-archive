        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just trying to think this through...</p>

<p>I/we know, without a doubt, that Hillary is guilty of mishandling classified material. Anyone who has ever held a security clearance knows there were many laws broken. 
Why would so many people be willing and complicit in conspiring to prevent the law from being carried out? From Director Comey all the way to Barack Obama, each one of them are required to compete the same training to keep their clearance active...if you have a clearance, you take the same annual refresher course. That training teaches us, exactly what Hillary did is against the law. Millions of people take this same training...each year. It&#39;s mandatory.<br/>
So, the only reason I can guess that all those people would put their careers and livelihoods on the line, is they are certain the next president/congress won&#39;t reopen the investigation. This president and congress are complicit and they believe the next will be too.</p>

<p>So, either they know it&#39;s rigged for Hillary, which means NWO; or they know neither candidate will, which means NWO.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>The whole scandal was orchestrated from the day the server was set up, <em>at a minimum</em>, in order to facilitate public consent to criminal behavior, consent to voting for it.</p>

<p>This is how all of fascism gets going...consent to ever greater evils.  So orchestrations, and blatant criminality need to be put on display, with people swallowing the lies and even arguing in their favor eventually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>NWO</strong> ... really? nope, it is not proof of a <strong>NEW WORLD ORDER</strong> conspiracy, but indeed it&#39;s proof that there exists individuals in this world that are far above national governments, like there have always been(they wore called <strong>Emperor&#39;s</strong> back in the day of the <strong>OLD WORLD ORDER</strong>) also for your information it stopped being a <strong>&quot;NEW&quot;</strong> World Order some ~30 years ago. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve been living in that <strong>&quot;NWO&quot;</strong> for quite some time, i would even say that that <strong>&quot;NWO&quot;</strong> you&#39;re speaking of, became <strong>ACTUAL WORLD ORDER</strong> in 1992 , around the time the Soviet Union fell.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> that there&#39;s a <strong>NEW WORLD ORDER</strong> conspiracy is that <strong>OBAMA, TRUDEAU and the MEXICAN CUCK</strong> are pushing for a <strong>NORTH AMERICAN UNION</strong> , without the <strong>CONSENT OF THE AMERICAN/CANADIAN/MEXICAN PEOPLE</strong> , that&#39;s far more proof for a <strong>NWO conspiracy</strong> than your average case of <strong>CORRUPTION</strong> that you could&#39;ve <strong>encountered in every Banana Republic or Empire</strong> that existed in these past 2000-4000 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used NWO for lack of a better term. To look at it as if what we call NWO is actually the current world order, for me, eliminates the possibility of stopping this travesty.

    <div class="md"><p>Centralization of power is unavoidable, it&#39;s in human nature to grow the size of the &quot;Tribe&quot;, what we can shape is the form that this Ultimate Centralization of power can have, currently there are 2 models, an Unipolar World Model and the other is a Multipolar World Model. </p>

<p>If no WW 3 happens in the next 10 - 20 years it will be the Multipolar model that comes out ahead(due to EURASIA becoming way to strong for USA/NAU to contest EURASIA and EURASIA will not accept orders from Washington/Jerusalem in that case). </p>

<p>The Unipolar model is the &quot;jewish/satanic/PNAC&quot; model(no identity/no morals/creation of slave race etc) One center of Power/decision, the Multipolar one is the one that Putin suggested in his 2006 <a href="https://vimeo.com/38311242">speech</a> (multiple centers of power/decision , each center of power/decision with it&#39;s own Identity/set of laws).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand all that. We, as well as other countries, have been positioning for such a war. The propaganda is everywhere. Most just don&#39;t see it. I believe the multi-polar power structure is under attack, with the intent of placing the Uni-polar structure you spoke of in place. I had hoped this post would help others make the connection that the NWO isn&#39;t coming, it&#39;s here.</p>
