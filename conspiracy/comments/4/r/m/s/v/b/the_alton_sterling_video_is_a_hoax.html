        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To support my case I am going to present two pieces of evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckuUk9R5ES0">A</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBZPCDqymyo">B</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These two pieces of evidence are the two publicly released video recordings of the supposed event, but as you are about to see, they are not continuous shots of a single event, and I intend to prove this conclusively.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about <strong>perspective</strong>.</p>

<p>The perspective of video A was shot from someone standing in between the convenience store and the yellow parking markers. In order to approximate their location, let us consider two frames from this video. The first of which is taken from the first second of the video, the second of which is taken from 12 seconds into the video when the person shooting the video points their camera away from the scene of action and at an almost vertical angle towards the ground.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/a4NGGqj.png">Frame of A at 0 seconds</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KPdh5Is.png">Frame of A at 12 seconds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these two frames it is reasonable to suppose that video A was taken by someone only a matter of steps away from the yellow parking lot markings, and was closer to them than the door of the convenience store. Without question this person should be visible in any footage of video B which is framing the area between the yellow parking lot markings and the convenience store.</p>

<p>So, all we should have to do is take a look at video B and find this person and then we can wrap this discussion up and call this a real event. Well, here are frames of video B which show the exact perspective where the person taking video A should be visible. The first two frames presented are for reference of the general perspective of video B.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3MQZRlz.png">Frame of B - 27 seconds</a></li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/8aEDYev.png">Frame of B - 32 seconds</a></li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wbAlBa0.png">Frame of B - 33 seconds (take 1)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UTxJkiP.png">Frame of B - 33 seconds (take 2)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>From the two frames taken from the 33rd second of video B we can see the exact perspective of where the person taking video A should be. The second of these frames (take 2) in particular shows a perspective in which the person taking video A couldn&#39;t possibly be absent, but yet we do not see any person besides the two cops and Alton Sterling in any of the frames. This is conclusive proof that the two videos were taken of two separate events and proof that this is a staged video.</p>

<p>This is all part of the divide and conquer agenda to initiate a race war so that the military can step in and enforce martial law. </p>

<p>Problem -&gt; Reaction -&gt; Solution</p>

<p>I rest my case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Debunked - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j3fzxd1.jpg">here is your cameraman in Angle A</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, here is an audio analysis of the two angles.  I have synced them up and phased matched them.  The police talking, gunshots, and music all happen at the same time.  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Nk30PCB.png">Picture</a></p>

<p><a href="https://clyp.it/kbzq2vfs">Link to synchronized sound bytes.</a>  A is Left channel, B is Right channel.  Left channel starts at 0:23.  B has been turned up by +5 dB to sound even with A.  Sum to mono if you really want to hear how they line up.  These videos were most definitely taken at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/wAH4PLK.png">Link to closeup of gunshot 3.</a>  This shows two very different Fourier waveforms, showing these are two different audio files, meaning the audio from the different camera angles were from the original recordings.</p>

<p><strong>The same event in time was recorded from two different video angles (as we can confirm visually) and two different microphone angles (as we can confirm through the analysis above).</strong>  Based on this evidence, we have proven OP&#39;s claim that the two separate videos are two separate events in time is false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you so caught up in looking into what&#39;s <em>hoaxed</em> in particular?  It really doesn&#39;t matter whether something is hoaxed or is a false flag because the ultimate point is that the event was contrived by TPTB in order to get an effect they desired out of the masses.  THAT&#39;S what people should be paying the most attention to.</p>

<p>Whether TPTB attempted to contrive the event to get the desired reaction out of the masses through a hoax or a false flag is actually kind of secondary.  That <em>main</em> point is that the given event was contrived.</p>

<p>As for this gas station shooting in particular, I - again - don&#39;t know if it&#39;s contrived or not given that police <em>are</em> often homicidal maniacs, but my point is that it seems to me that you&#39;re kind of missing the point if you go after arguing too strongly about whether an event is a hoax or a false flag.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>it doesn&#39;t matter</em>.  Whether the event is a hoax or a false flag, it&#39;s <em>definitely</em> an event TPTB are using to try to manipulate the masses.  That should be the main point of focus between truth-seekers instead of arguing about whether it was a false flag or a hoax and ending up creating a division that doesn&#39;t need to be there between people who are trying to seek the truth.</p>

<p>And I realize that part of seeking the truth is in fact finding out whether an event was a false flag or a hoax.  However, given that there is so much cointelpro going on in this planet, it seems that it should <em>first</em> be established whether an event was staged/contrived or not regardless of specifically <em>how</em> or what kind of contrivance it was.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  I agree with this.  I think you’re putting the cart before the horse a bit, however.  First and foremost, we don’t know if it was a hoax or not.  You might have suspicions about it, but - as this very OP clearly shows - you’re going to come up against a lot of counterarguments when you go saying an event was definitely a hoax…and some of those counterarguments can be pretty valid and solid.</p>

<p>However, if you <em>first</em> get everybody on board and just show that it was definitively a PTB contrived event (hoax or not), <em>then</em> you can move on at that point and figure out <em>what</em> type of contrived event it was.</p>

<p>You see, the problem with the whole “hoax vs. false flag” argument is that it’s literally a method that keeps the truth seekers doing little more than spinning their wheels as they argue amongst each other with regard to whether a contrived event was one or the other.  Meanwhile, nothing actually gets done about the fact that IT WAS A CONTRIVED EVENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A FALSE FLAG OR A HOAX or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Once you figure out the an event was definitively a covertly manipulated event, then you can move forward as a people toward OUSTING those who contrived the event.</p>

<p>However, if you spend/waste too much of any time going back and forth with regard to whether it was a false flag or a hoax, then you’re just basically going to be spinning your wheels while nothing actually gets done.</p>

<p>Again, you’re putting the cart before the horse.</p>

<p>Just realize that whether this particular event was a false flag or a hoax or was 100% absolutely real and there was nothing contrived about it, it definitely speaks of the degraded, degenerate state that this nation and this world is in.</p>

<p>We don’t need to know <em>what</em> kind of “shitty event” this was in order to still <em>know</em> that it indeed was a very shitty event and we need to move forward together with figuring out what we could and should do to improve things.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if somebody just <em>insists</em> “Na, man!  It was a hoax!  You <em>have</em> to see things that way!”…then that person is actually taking energy <em>away</em> from what should be done to combat the fact that it was a “shitty event” that needs to get addressed regardless of what <em>kind</em> of “shitty event” it was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is very important to understand to methods they are using.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I agree…but first thing’s first.  We first need to all get on the same page that a crime is occurring (against the individual/from the state/etc) before we can figure out what specific methods were used to commit it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only because it arms you against falling for their tricks in the future, but it directly points at who is carrying all this out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with all of this.</p>

<p>I just don’t want you/me/us/<em>anybody</em> to literally lose the forest for the trees is all - and arguing about the issues at this level might be similar to splitting needless hairs before you even find out whose <em>head</em> the hairs are even on in the first place.</p>

<p>That’s a different thing altogether, however, because the people that would say that would simply not know what the heck they’re talking about.  The race war on this planet is absolutely 100% contrived and does not in any way have to be the way it is if at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then I&#39;d have to prove something like this is a hoax or false flag.</p>

<p>Police brutality isn’t the only thing that is indicative of endemic racism in this country and on this planet.  It is indicative of TPTB simply taking advantage of the masses to a great extent.  Police brutality isn’t <em>only</em> about racism.  It includes it, but there’s much more going on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You’re not going to “wake up” everybody.  Matter of fact, we should be paying most attention to waking up ourselves as individuals independent of what the rest of the public thinks one way or the other.</p>

<p>I feel there’s a lot more that I know than some people…but I also feel there’s a <em>lot</em> more that some others know than me, so I’m more concerned with educating myself with regard to what’s really going on than in trying to educate others.</p>

<p>Whether this was a hoax or not, I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;d sooner put it as real than fake, but - again - I don&#39;t know what really happened, so it could have been faked (though, again, I&#39;m betting on it being real).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but like I said I would assume based on the way sound editors work that they would use consistent audio between the two videos. It would be way too obvious to use audio from two different takes in two different videos. I&#39;ve seen a lot of goofs in media fakery, but if they did that it would be the biggest one yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with OP that the shoes are reflections in the side mirror. Also, I don&#39;t know what frame your pic is from, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sr4n48wyBU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">this slowmo version</a> clearly shows there is nobody standing there. </p>

<p>Your audio analysis is compelling, don&#39;t get me wrong. But ultimately it is less convincing than the clear video evidence that there was nobody standing there. </p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t you find it rather convenient that in video just happens to pan away just before the man is shot, but then pans back and calmly continues to video. Sorry, but if the police shoot someone 5 feet away from me, I&#39;m going to get the fuck out of there. </p>

<p>I will admit that Alton&#39;s wound and movements seem much more realistic than any of the crisis acting we&#39;ve seen in many of these other staged events. If this was real, my heart goes out to the man and his family.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a tough one but I think it&#39;s real. At first I was thinking fake because of the gunshot sounds and no flash from barrels. But then I went and look at some videos of me standing directly behind my wife while she is shooting a fs92. On my phone video there is no flash, and the sound is almost exactly the same when she shoots and the cop shoots. In video b the person recording ducks down when the guns are fired, I would assume this would be a normal action for anyone, I know I sure as fuck would be ducking. Video a is pretty convincing as well, the dude literally looks like he is dying and the blood is very convincing. Not to mention you can hear the cap saying before the shots &quot;hey bro, you fuck with me I swear to god&quot;. Well he kept his promise :-(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ultimate goal of this agenda is to enact martial law on the citizens of the United States. In order to do that without the public revolting and refusing to obey authority there must be a perceived legitimate justification for doing so. Since, there isn&#39;t an actual justification for doing so, those who want to carry out the agenda are creating a fake justification based on lies and manipulation of public sentiment.</p>

<p>They have faked this event and many others to rile up emotions between blacks and white and between citizens in police so that there will be a small but controlled uprising which will be just bad enough that the government will say they have to declare martial law so chaos does not break out, but the uprising will not be one of sufficient size to actually threaten their power.</p>

Actually, maybe this is a merging. Maybe the seconded video was shot in a mirrored dimension of this Earth. That&#39;s the more likely explanation.  </p>

<p>Whether this was a hoax or not, I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;d sooner put it as real than fake, but - again - I don&#39;t know what really happened, so it could have been faked (though, again, I&#39;m betting on it being real).</p>
