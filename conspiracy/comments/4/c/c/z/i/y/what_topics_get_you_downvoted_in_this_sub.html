    <div class="md"><p>Right.  I think this sub is a place where it&#39;s ok to say stuff about</p>

<ul>
<li>Gmos</li>
<li>big pharma</li>
</ul>

<p>But with vaccines it&#39;s a wash</p>

<p>Outing fake events gets you someone always saying, false flag doesn&#39;t mean someone didn&#39;t die.  Which is true.  In fact Thomas Sheridan does a very good job pointing out how this particular subject is very sensitive because if you&#39;re wrong and you&#39;ve accused the media of fakery but someone really <em>did</em> die, then you look like an asshole.  (which is what they want--don&#39;t give them what they want)</p>

<p>Global warming is another one of those things.  I&#39;m actually on the fence with this issue.  I feel like I&#39;ll never know enough.  However I DO believe in weather manipulation.  I believe that the RRR (polar vortex / california 3 yr drought) was done on purpose by haarp type tech in order to reverse the jet streams in order to restart the stalled gulf of mexico current loop that stalled as a direct consequence of the deepwater horizon incident. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/46p1i8/how_haarp_the_polar_vortex_rrr_may_have_helped/?ref=search_posts">I  posted about this here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>re: global warming, just look up the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures going back thousands of years and you&#39;ll see that the sun was, is, and will continue to be the #1 factor in temperatures by far.  Then look at all of the times the IPCC has been caught with its pants down falsifying data.  Then look at the &quot;studies&quot; where those &quot;97% of scientists agree&quot; numbers come from and realize how fake those percentages are.  And then go from there.</p>

<p>Obviously humans are having a negative impact on the environment but all of this global warming nonsense is, well, nonsense.  Also consider that they do all this talk about limiting carbon emissions.  Well who is the biggest polluter on planet earth?  The US military/government, and it isn&#39;t even close.  Where is the green movement calling for a limit to military spending or a limit to senseless wars?  You won&#39;t hear a peep from them about that, because the movement is controlled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That used to bother a lot me because it felt like people here believe that literally every major event in modern history is a false flag. Obviously that is patently absurd. And claiming false flag the day of an event is clearly not based on strong evidence. </p>

<p>After a while, I started to find it productive. Not that I find evidence that every event is a false flag, but rather that we should vigorously question the official narrative every time. Even if TPTB are not behind an event, they will certainly spin the reaction to their favor. But I do believe that history will prove that they were behind quite a few <em>scale tipping</em> events.</p>

<p>On a somewhat related note: Try searching &#39;Dani Dayan Zionist&#39; on google, I just did and for some reason the results I got had the words &#39;Jewish&#39; and &#39;Israel&#39; highlighted as if google considers them the same as &#39;zionist&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go watch stuff. Youtube &quot;no plane theory.&quot; There&#39;s a lot to explain, and quite a few possibilities involved. Needless to say, there are men of great stature, pilots, retired military, etc that have come out as &quot;no planers&quot; to put a tag on it. They bring hard science and physics to the table about subjects that still remain unexplained by the official story. By being able to set aside the fact that (presumably random) video submissions of people saying they &quot;saw a plane!,&quot; the theory opens up full scale to all sorts of possibilities. You can weigh the number of people on video saying they saw planes vs the number that didn&#39;t hear or see anything before the explosions, and I can promise you that you would be surprised. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a sneak peak: planes, that large, CANNOT fly at the speeds they did, at the altitude they did, and pull the maneuvers they did. Even if they were somehow able to, the sound from full throttle engines and impossible air displacement would have been deafening to all who were present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you have to watch the coverage of the event, live, on all networks.</p>

<p>So my suggestion is to start there.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/abc200109110831-0912">Here is ABC</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/nbc200109110831-0912">Here is NBC</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/cbs200109110831-0912">Here is CBS</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/cnn200109110848-0929">Here is CNN</a></p>

<p>The time you want to skip to is around 9:01 and just let it roll. Watch it on mute once, even, before you watch it with sound.</p>

<p>Take note of the characters on screen and <em>covering</em> the event. Make note of who the on-site reporters are - and their relationships with the networks themselves.</p>

<p>I am working for the next two days and have projects due all weekend but will always prioritize this conversation over all other obligations.</p>

<p>I am 100% serious about this. This plave is filled with trolls and disinfo.</p>

<p>You know <a href="/u/whipnil">/u/whipnil</a>.</p>

<p>You know me.</p>

<p>Look at the Owl.</p>

<p>Now back at me.</p>

<p>Now I mod this sub. And I&#39;m telling you - watch the links. I have nothing to hide and everything to gain.</p>

<p>You owe yourself.</p>

<p>But make no mistake - there&#39;s <strong>no going back</strong>.</p>

<p>Proof? Please don&#39;t make hard assertions of things that you do not know to be factual. That&#39;s &quot;truthiness&quot; at its worst and only does a great disservice to informed discussion. Gullible people will read your assertion and not question your motives or actual knowledge of the situation and take it as fact. It creates a vicious cycle of defamation and disinformation.</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<p>Criticizing Catholicism in a real way.</p>

<p>Criticizing the Pope in any real way.</p>

<p>Criticizing Jesuits (Society of Jesus)</p>

<p>Criticizing Opus Dei</p>

<p>Criticizing Freemasons or Freemasonry</p>

<p>Criticising Fraternal Order of Police</p>

<p>Putting forth information that associates political candidates with secret societies, in a legitimate way (government document)</p>

<p>Information tying any of the above to each other</p>

<p>Anything related to gangstalking, because everyone knows it&#39;s always a mentally ill paranoiac</p>

<p>Anything related to targetted energy weapony, see above
Info about Government selling drugs, especially Opiates</p>

<p>Anything related to psychedelics</p>

<p>Speaking of which, anything validating Terence McKenna, Alan Watts, their contemporaries--everyone knows they were double agent working for them and not secretly working for you.</p>

pro-trump stuff is upvoted, anti-bernie is a wash; I would say (in this sub) pro-hillary gets instadownvote, but that&#39;s by <em>us</em>, not by <em>them</em>.  I&#39;m trying to get at what is controlled.  Sometimes it&#39;s so difficult to decouple the two that the effort to do so is pointless.</p>

<p>Proof? Please don&#39;t make hard assertions of things that you do not know to be factual. That&#39;s &quot;truthiness&quot; at its worst and only does a great disservice to informed discussion. Gullible people will read your assertion and not question your motives or actual knowledge of the situation and take it as fact. It creates a vicious cycle of defamation and disinformation.</p>
