<p>Four things that really stuck out to me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At 6:08 on the third video down, a bar graph is shown listing the amount of Jews in different countries. #1 on the list is USA with 5.8 million; #2 is Israel with 4.847 million. Not sure how accurate that is but very damn interesting if so.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t take Sherlock Holmes to connect the dots of the dancing Israeli Mossad agents - here&#39;s the most logical scenario: 1. The Israeli &quot;movers&quot; cheered the 9-11 attacks to celebrate the successful accomplishment of the greatest spy operation ever pulled off in history. 2. One of them, or an accomplice, then calls a 9-1-1 police dispatcher to report Palestinian bomb-makers in a white van headed for the Holland Tunnel. 3. Having thus pre-framed the Palestinians with this phone call, the Israeli bombers then head for the George Washington Bridge instead, where they will drop off their time-bomb van and escape with Urban Moving accomplices. 4. But the police react very wisely and proactively by closing off ALL bridges and tunnels instead of just the Holland Tunnel. This move inadvertently foils the Israelis&#39; misdirection play and leads to their own capture and 40 day torture. 5. To cover up this story, the U.S. Justice Department rounds up over 1000 Arabs for minor immigration violations and places them in New York area jails. The Israelis therefore become less conspicuous as the government and media can now claim that the Israelis were just immigration violators caught in the same dragnet as many other Arabs. 6. After several months, FBI and Justice Department &quot;higher-ups&quot; are able to gradually push aside the local FBI agents and free the Israelis quietly.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>But bin Laden strongly denied any role in the attacks and suggested that Zionists orchestrated the
9-11 attacks. The BBC published bin Laden&#39;s statement of denial in which he said: &quot;I was not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States nor did I have knowledge of the attacks. There exists a government within a government within the United States. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity. That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks. ... The American system is totally in control of the Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States.&quot;</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bin Laden is not named as the perpetrator of 9/11 by the FBI: When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on Bin Laden’s Most Wanted web page (30), [Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI] said, “The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.”</p>

<p>By the way, this source is from <a href="http://pastebin.com/MSvkCCRy">this</a> pastebin, which is from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bwvn1/an_anon_posted_this_textfile_and_said_pass/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link">this</a> reddit post just submitted yesterday. There&#39;s a ton of in depth information there and I&#39;ve only barely gotten through it. Good stuff.</p>
