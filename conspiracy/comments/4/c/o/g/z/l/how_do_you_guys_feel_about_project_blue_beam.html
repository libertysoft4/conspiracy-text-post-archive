    <div class="md"><p>Okay, in this talk by Cathy O&#39;Brien <a href="https://youtu.be/FvEBmEo4IA0">https://youtu.be/FvEBmEo4IA0</a> there is a point where she talks about people saying they were Aliens to induce fear, and make her feel as though she didn&#39;t stand a chance.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-Qa9IU1Z6ic">https://youtu.be/-Qa9IU1Z6ic</a>. I watched this video and in the second half it talks more about Aliens and how that could happen.</p>

<p>The memoirs in linked in this article <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/09/idaho-shooting-suspects-hypersexual-martian-manifesto-is-a-window-into-an-unraveling-mind/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/09/idaho-shooting-suspects-hypersexual-martian-manifesto-is-a-window-into-an-unraveling-mind/</a> talk about Aliens as well.</p>

<p>However, after reading about it, it sounded similar to electronic possession so I asked <a href="/u/curiosity36">/u/curiosity36</a> if he&#39;s seen aliens before (we talk a bit, he has a website, <a href="https://unitedagainstmindcontrol.wordpress.com/">https://unitedagainstmindcontrol.wordpress.com/</a>). He told me that he has, and went into a little bit of detail as to what happened.</p>

<p>I also heard, although I do not have a source, that if aliens existed the pope would baptize them.  Again, although no source I have heard the powers that be want a one world religion and have picked the Catholic Church.  </p>

<p>I talked to my sister in law about it, and she told me she was curious if back in the day when people where getting abducted by aliens if it wasn&#39;t actually just people wearing masks.  The moment being so terrifying that you must believe that it was aliens.</p>

<p>So, mostly speculation, but I do think it&#39;s going to be a hoax.  And if the moment comes, and it isn&#39;t a hoax, and I still refuse to go with them, I would rather die on this planet then live with creatures that would practice all the atrocities that man kind has faced.</p>

<p>Also, I am interesting I&#39;m hearing what information or opinions you have on the matter.  :)</p>

<p>This reminds me of something similar and, actually, a little funny. When they were first testing propellerless-aircraft (jets) they had the pilot wear a gorilla suit. That way if anyone in a standard airplane at the time saw the experimental craft flying, they&#39;d also report it was being flown by a gorilla and be dismissed as insane. Gray aliens the next step? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t have very much info other than reading a lot of Serge Monast&#39;s thoughts on it. I think it&#39;s very possible, simply because not many people in the general public think mind control is really a thing. Though I do wonder how microchipping fits into Blue Beam. Maybe just an easier way to manipulate everyone&#39;s thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if they have a hologram only, when the attacks happen (if attacks happen). There is going to need to be a way for us to feel it.  So they would have to control our internal understanding to match the external understanding.  And perhaps the rare few that have the ability to block psychic attack either electronically or telepathically (i think that&#39;s the word I want) would believe by &quot;seeing&quot; and the fear of it would be enough to have them too in awe to know what to question.  Also, I was raised religious, I don&#39;t have an exact place to reference this too but my parents always said that in the last days to know if who you were interacting with was real you&#39;d have to shake their hands.   I always thought it was going to be demons, but.... A hologram would probably fit better....?  Haha who knows, mostly speculation with a couple scary things to guess from, you know? </p>

<p>And isn&#39;t that what chem and contrails are being used for, to create a sort of projection screen for this to go down? </p>

<p>At this point it seems too far-fetched and too large in scope to pull off effectively, but critical thinkers who see through the veil could be marginalized and attacked by the general population (much like those who criticize the official version of 9 11 we were fed have been marginalized for the past 15 years) if it ever does go down as rumored.</p>

Probably very multi-faceted in purpose: As a container lid/screen, cover and also just a cheaper avenue for expulsion of materials.
