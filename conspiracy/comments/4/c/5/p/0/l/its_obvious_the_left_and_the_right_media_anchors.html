What I want to know however is HOW  they get them. Expose that and you break the system. What is the chain of custody of the uniform daily message?</p>

<p>Is it a daily system wide email? A secret phone cal each mornin? who does it come from? how does go out to all the news agencies and DIFFERENT news networks (so it can&#39;t be coming individually from editors because someone is telling the editors).</p>

<p>And who... literally who not &quot;the owners or the establishment &quot; but which PERSON ...does it come from?</p>

<p>When very single media outlet has the same talking points someone MUST be writing and desseminating those talking points. Follow that trail and you  haveit.</p>

<p>And it wouldntbe too hard.</p>

<p>Who told Don Lemon that no one on his show could mention Ted Cruz started the fued  about the wives for example?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1wfIHP9t_c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1wfIHP9t_c</a> And who told every other media anchor? When clearly cruz superpac did start it and its ridiculous to say Trump did?</p>

<p>Who told everyone they had to start saying Trump supporters  were racist and violent when clearly it was the protesters.  Some one person had to come up with those media wide messages becuase clearly every single news anchor gets them.</p>

<p>Or now who told all the media to say Sanders just won in mostly white states when it isn&#39;t true?  <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/VDNIW">https://m.imgur.com/a/VDNIW</a></p>

<p>How does don lemon get those message? Is it a daily email? Is it in a morning meeting?</p>

<p>That is what we need to  start asking media types.</p>

<p>If anonymous was real I would have thought they would have hacked those media internal communication systems. It make me think maybe anonymous isn&#39;t real.</p>

Those six companies are GE, Disney, Newscorp, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS.<br/>
The talking points are emailed out every morning to those companies and are then distributed to all subsidiaries.  </p>

<p>Ok.</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<p>Now do you know this? Is this an assumption?  Have you seen a story somewhere that exposed? Or heard an actually recipient or employee talks about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well - Out their on the interwebz are a lot of sources. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies">This one</a> is about how Fox News does their Daily Memos(it&#39;s a bit of a wall of text).  </p>

<p>Fox News Channel executives exert a degree of editorial control over the content of the network&#39;s daily reporting. The channel&#39;s Vice President of News, John Moody, controls content by writing memos to the news department staff. In the documentary Outfoxed, former Fox News employees talk about the inner workings of the channel. In memos from the documentary, Moody instructs employees how to approach particular stories and on what stories to approach. Critics of Fox News claim that the instructions on many of the memos indicate a conservative bias. The Washington Post quoted Larry Johnson, a former part-time Fox News commentator, describing the Moody memos as &quot;talking points instructing us what the themes are supposed to be, and God help you if you stray.&quot;</p>

<p>Former Fox News producer Charlie Reina explained, &quot;The roots of Fox News Channel&#39;s day-to-day on-air bias are actual and direct. They come in the form of an executive memo distributed electronically each morning, addressing what stories will be covered and, often, suggesting how they should be covered. To the newsroom personnel responsible for the channel&#39;s daytime programming, The Memo is the Bible. If, on any given day, you notice that the Fox anchors seem to be trying to drive a particular point home, you can bet The Memo is behind it.&quot;  </p>

<p>Photocopied memos from John Moody instructed the network&#39;s on-air anchors and reporters to use positive language when discussing pro-life viewpoints, the Iraq War, and tax cuts, as well as requesting that the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal be put in context with the other violence in the area.[84] Such memos were reproduced for the film Outfoxed, which included Moody quotes such as, &quot;The soldiers [seen on Fox in Iraq] in the foreground should be identified as &#39;sharpshooters,&#39; not &#39;snipers,&#39; which carries a negative connotation.&quot;[citation needed]</p>

<p>Two days after the 2006 election, The Huffington Post reported that its news department had acquired a copy of a leaked internal memo from Mr. Moody that recommended the following: &quot;…[L]et&#39;s be on the lookout for any statements from the Iraqi insurgents, who must be thrilled at the prospect of a Dem-controlled congress.&quot; Within hours of the memo&#39;s publication, Fox News anchor Martha McCallum, went on-air on the program The Live Desk with reports of Iraqi insurgents cheering the firing of Donald Rumsfeld and the results of the 2006 congressional election.[85][86]) is about how the memos are distributed by Fox News. The relevant except is :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent years investigating this stuff. It can&#39;t be traced back to one group concretely. Go past a certain level of the power structure (Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Knights of Malta, Society of Jesus, Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Ancient Order of Foresters, etc.) and you are met with shadows. </p>

<p>In terms of talking points, it&#39;s pretty easy to do from a top-down structure of command, right? The hidden shadow handlers of Rupert Murdoch of Newscorp,  Steven Burke of Comcast NBC, Robert Marcus of Time Warner and Les Moonves of CBS, tell them the talking points, have each leg spin it according to their M.O. (Fox spins for Republicans, CNN for Democrats, etc), and have the normal operations within the networks do their thing.</p>

<p>Most of these dodos have every word that comes out of their mouth scripted anyway, so they aren&#39;t probably critically thinking about anything. Plus there is probably some damning video or photographic blackmail evidence in place to keep them in line, so they just play their role out of fear of repercussions.</p>

But i don&#39;t want this discussion to devolve into the normal generalities.</p>

<p>I want specifics . Specific people whose names are on the emails or the phone calss or whatever. Recordings of the morning meetings where they say it.  They must exist.</p>

<p>I want to trace the emails phone calls whatever.</p>

<p>.I ideally want someone who has seen them  (which would have to be every anchor) to expose them and leak examples.</p>

<p>It is widepsread so every anchor must has seen them. Literally every host must be told some how.</p>

<p>Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban. Anyone who has lived long in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items of news — things which on their own merits would get the big headlines-being kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that ‘it wouldn’t do’ to mention that particular fact. So far as the daily newspapers go, this is easy to understand. The British press is extremely centralised, and most of it is owned by wealthy men who have every motive to be dishonest on certain important topics. But the same kind of veiled censorship also operates in books and periodicals, as well as in plays, films and radio. At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is ‘not done’ to say it, just as in mid-Victorian times it was ‘not done’ to mention trousers in the presence of a lady. Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals.
