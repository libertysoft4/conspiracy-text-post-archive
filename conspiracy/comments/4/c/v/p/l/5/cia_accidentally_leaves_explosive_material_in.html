        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The CIA left &#39;an explosives training material&#39; in a Virginia school bus that then took dozens of children, including elementary students, to three different schools, Fox News reported Thursday.</p>

<p>The material had been placed in the engine compartment of a school bus on March 24 as part of training exercises between the CIA and local law enforcement agencies, but was &#39;inadvertently&#39; left there for a week afterward, authorities said.</p>

<p>The bus then continued its rounds, carrying 26 students - and the material - on eight trips over 145 miles to Rock Ridge High School, Buffalo Trail Elementary School and Pinebrook Elementary School.</p>

<p>The material was found on Wednesday, during a maintenance check. The bus had been in operation for at least two days in the intervening week.</p>

<p>The material had originally been placed there in a container during a training exercise for the CIA&#39;s K-9 units at Briar Woods High School in Loudoun County, but had fallen out into the main engine compartment, authorities said.</p>

<p>They maintain that nobody in the bus was in any danger at any point.</p>

<p>However, neither the CIA nor the local agencies involved in the exercises - which included the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office and the Fire Marshal - would give a more detailed description of what the &#39;materials&#39; were.</p>

<p>&#39;The exact nature of the training material used in this exercise is not being released at the request of the CIA so as not to compromise its training techniques,&#39; county officials told Fox News.</p>

<p>After the discovery an email was sent out to parents by school officials, but it left more questions open than answered, the station reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They wouldn&#39;t train with any  material that would be capable of detonating. I&#39;m pretty sure they wouldn&#39;t want their dogs or themselves to blow up. My guess is that they offered the dog training to local law enforcement and they needed places  to hide scented material for the exercise and the local department arranged the locations. They definitely should account for all of the materials they are using in order to avoid panicking anyone so that part of it is sloppy work on their part. As far as the legality of it, it doesn&#39;t look like any type of intelligence gathering so I would guess that it&#39;s allowed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that youre correct in that the materials probably weren&#39;t posing an actual threat, but that&#39;s not the underlying issue here.</p>

<p>For one this, the mandate of the CIA is to conduct foreign intelligence gathering- supposedly via Humint.</p>

<p>Of course, we know that they have been extended beyond this mandate and are heavily involved in espionage and even targeted assassination in order to conduct extrajudicial policy goals without direct accountability of government.</p>

<p>But the crossover to conducting operations on domestic soil is huge and one that has been addressed in the past.</p>

<p>This is a quote from Frank Church who investigated the CIA for wrongdoings in the 70&#39;s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing, the United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air. (...) </p>

<p>Now, that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies. We must know, at the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left such is the capability to monitor everything—telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn&#39;t matter. There would be no place to hide.
If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology. (...)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why is the CIA tasking themselves to work with local law enforcement, given what we know about their propensity to target policy and manipulate societies? </p>

<p>But even if it was local law enforcement acting alone in a drill like this, it puts civilians at risk by virtue of potentially putting civilians in the illegal possession of controlled substances.  They have training facilities- keep that stuff out of public places.</p>

<p>absolutely.  at the same time, dogs are trained to give false alerts as legal justification for search.  I think this is an additional worry given CIA involvement considering their predilection for effecting policy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/04/federal-appeals-court-drug-dog-thats-barely-more-accurate-than-a-coin-flip-is-good-enough/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/04/federal-appeals-court-drug-dog-thats-barely-more-accurate-than-a-coin-flip-is-good-enough/</a></p>

<p>If the CIA is training police on how to search for explosives, I want to know if they are also training them to use loopholes to justify warrantless search- and I&#39;d suspect that they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what I&#39;m saying is that dogs are used as justification to enact warrantless vehicle search.  Clearly we are talking about a scenario where they are training for vehicle searches.</p>

<p>Of COURSE they WANT dogs to be able to find illicit substances- that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about.  I&#39;m referring to the back-up for when they DON&#39;T find the illicit substance- when the LEO signals for a false alert as pretense to search a vehicle.</p>

<p>If a police officer intuitively suspects that there is something hidden in a vehicle, but has no probable cause to effect a search, they are using the dogs as a loophole to do so.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-WMn_zHCVo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-WMn_zHCVo</a></p>

<p>And clearly the threat of &quot;terrorism&quot; is being used to justify enhanced police powers that are not actually just about terrorism.  So don&#39;t be so quick to differentiate between a k9 searching for drugs and one searching for explosives.</p>

<p>If they are training local police on the use of canines (which I&#39;ve pointed out can be used to justify warrantless search), might they also be working with local law enforcement agencies on enhanced interrogation techniques?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>High grade explosives will not detonate from heat, theyll deflagrate but they wont blow. A .50 cal round wont even set them off, you need a primary explosive otherwise known as a blasting cap to set them off. Something like an azide or peroxide based explosive. All of which are easy to synthesize, even high grade explosives are relatively easy if you got the right equipment. RDX being the easiest with chemicals available to any civilian. Peroxides require literally no effort to synth either.  Combine the two and you have a military grade explosive that can take out armour or hardened positions. Its what the establishment fears, teks on how to properly implement shaped charges with these materials are also readily available. Given enough skill, combining the two with simple rocketry would produce a warhead capable of dropping a modern tank. The thinking and designing doesnt even need to be done. All those specs are already out there. Someone could create this shit in their spare time, and strapping these bombs to RC vehicles would provide a lucrative mode of attack. The problem is, most criminals are dumb. Will this land me on a list? I hope so. Armour isnt hard to defeat. </p>

Virginia has the most bases for military/special &quot;division&quot; on the whole East Coast, maybe in the whole USA. I heard of some corrupt stuff CIA/FBI been doing..... I am honestly not surprised the CIA did this... I totally see it happening.I have never heard of Loudon though, I believe its a &quot;ruralish&quot;/country area. Or else I woulda heard of it. No surprise... Local news paper has nothing on this story. I do have a local news reporter on my FB, should I send a link get her to write something to bring attention???
