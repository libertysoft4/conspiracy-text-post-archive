        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It could be just be me ranting or looking too much into things but has anyone else around these here parts noticed that all of the conspiracy forums are literally drowned in politics? The fringe ideas, UFOs, secret space programs and whatever else considered &#39;fringe&#39; seem to have simply been rubbed off the alternative thinking radar.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been happening on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a lot over the last few years as well. Almost as if (tinfoil hat time) that audiences are  being directed towards shitty mundane tittle-tattle conspiracy pieces, as opposed to the meat. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, Government political BS is at an all time high and it&#39;s only right that we give POTUS candidates as much scrutiny as possible and question their motives, connections and background. </p>

<p>But away from that self repeating cycle i honestly have noticed - and not just on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, a move away from the fringe topics. </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think that this is not by accident. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more. I think it could be a coordinated effort to push people away from fringe theories to more &quot;kosher&quot; theories. Talking about JFK/FED/9-11, kosher. Talking about electric universe, hollow earth, fringe science, alternative 9/11 theories, occult/esoteric, fringe history, etc etc... &quot;This is what makes us look bad&quot;. Therefore others will not even entertain it. Many &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are just as close minded as the people they call &quot;sheep&quot;.</p>

There is A LOT of neat quirks about FE. One being you can make provable observations to give you a foundation of flat earth/ among the fact you can&#39;t trust ABC agencies w your perceived reality.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re totally right, and there has definitely been a push towards the more &#39;acceptable&#39; theories...but at the same time I often found myself arguing against those fringe theorists because 90% of the time their only supporting evidence is how &#39;cool&#39; the idea sounds.  Then they act offended or resort to &#39;wake up sheeple&#39; tactics when they&#39;re unable to defend any part of their ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s relevant, but do we really need a bunch of people that are really only disaffected Bernie, Hillary, or Trump supporters only interested in &quot;their team&quot; being affected by it? That&#39;s what a lot of these articles cater to. You have to be a Democrat or Republican to give a massive shit. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s those who are genuinely interested in discussing a rigged system, but then there&#39;s those that just want to vindicate their own warped beliefs that the system is stacked against &quot;their team&quot; and they aren&#39;t looking at the larger picture. And yet, they continue supporting these traitorous political parties. The solution is to stop putting these people into office and rewarding their corrupt parties.</p>

<p>I feel like this happens every election season, and yet, people are still voting for Democrats and Republicans. We never see this much &quot;conspiracy&quot; content even dedicated to actual third parties. People balk at third party voices, vote for the two majors, and then bitch about how corrupt they are. That&#39;s the real insanity if you ask me.</p>

<p>Forum sliding and topic dilution. All of the irrelevant posts are voted up, and the relevant posts are voted down. Trump voted up, AE911 voted down.</p>

<p>Consensus cracking. Obviously implausible subjects, such as Flat Earth or Lizard Illuminati, are brought up in an attempt to divide and conquer the users. Fake accounts additionally gaslight the remaining users, to make them either doubt their own judgment, or to stop participating completely despite their disagreement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im under the impression the conspiracy forums get flooded with mainstream politics in order to gage opinions and ideas of fringe thinkers. Once they figure out how you are responding, they will have a better rounded form of blanket media that even the &quot;crazies&quot; accept. Your responses are surely being analyzed and categorized. We are the hardest crowd to sway. Thats why. We all understand that politics are &quot;important&quot; but don&#39;t lose sight of how you are contributing to the conversations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/za/za63.htm">This</a> basically describes the theory behind it. It used references from the 1700s, 1800s where people have recorded seeing this sort of thing. Naturally, we&#39;re not going to have much, if any, modern evidence of this since the majority of the world is deadset on the idea that the moon is a sphere capable of being landed on..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks ! Never heard of this I&#39;ll check it out. When Randall Carlson was on joe rogan one time joe asked about the moon and Randall cryptically said that that would be a whole other show. Got me very curious indeed. </p>

<p>The connection to the crescent and the star is definitely intriguing as well.  I&#39;ve recently been introduced to the idea that the all the major religious symbols weren&#39;t always separated by the different religions. This is very evident in many works of art that depict both the cross the crescent and the Star of David simultaneously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that the Star of David never had anything to do with David or Israel. I&#39;ve read that the earliest known use of it was with Arab magicians. And coincidentally, the Bible mentions the Jews taking up the Star of their god Remphan, aka Chiun and Moloch.</p>

<p>I find that Islam and Judaism are far more intertwined than most people realize. I don&#39;t understand it. But from an article I saw on this sub a while back, the Saudis being formerly Jewish is apparently a thing.</p>

<p>As far as the cross goes, I&#39;m not sure if it had roots in paganism.. Or if it came from the ancient <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ancient+hebrew+alphabet&amp;amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;amp;prmd=ivn&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-vLuVqOLLAhVEJCYKHaSRB9wQ_AUIBygB&amp;amp;biw=360&amp;amp;bih=518#imgrc=ZhgHVBtGm8LgyM%3A">hebrew alphabet</a> .. See the 2nd to last letter. It can sometimes mean &quot;to seal a covenant&quot;, which is exactly what Christ did.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s a dream my mother had 5+ years ago that makes me really wonder about Islam and the purpose of the star and crescent.. But that&#39;s not anything anyone would consider official evidence, so lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the obvious stifling by reddit moderators on popular subreddits has caused r/conspiracy to become a place where sort of every redditor knows &quot;if it is being censored on polular subreddits, it wont be on r/conspiracy&quot;. I think that the most important conspiracy is the one affecting everyone&#39;s lives, and thus more people can relate. Lets use the lastest crisis in Flint Michigan as a prime example: a situation were a high ranked government official saved the state money by rerouting poisonous water to a poor area and covered it up using tax payer funds and trust as a means to essentially &quot;get away with it&quot; until concerned citizens took action. This is an act which actually affects people and was carried out and attempted to be covered up by an elected official. This is information that not only shows the discontent elected officials have for the people who elect them, but the shady and damaging tactics that they take in order to generate more profit. This is the complete opposite of what elected officials are elected to do; represent the people who vote for them.</p>

<p>The aforementioned shouldn&#39;t even be a conspiracy, it should just be news, and the fact that it is deemed a conspiracy until proven true should just go to show how messed up a society we live in. When scientific fact gets misconstrued as conspiracy because the actual facts are so brazen that they couldn&#39;t possibly be true until they are shows just how powerful money is compared to factual information.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, i love the fringe topics, and i think once your own rabbit hole gets deeper you are left with a pot of fringe conclusions because that is where the logical conclusions lie; but this place has become a source for real news amongst a plethora of obvious propaganda. I think the fact that most who visit r/conspiracy for real news should make us fear what we are told is news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, this didn&#39;t happen because of government activity, but simply because UFOlogy has dug its&#39; own grave.  The UFO scene has been a talk show circuit and a vaudevillian sideshow for at least five years now.  It&#39;s been completely taken over by con artists.  I used to listen to said people on Project Camelot.  They tell interesting stories at first, but then you quickly realise that they are full of shit and they just want everyone&#39;s money.</p>

<p>I ended up finding out that most of the cryptozoology cases I ever looked into were hoaxes, as well.  I haven&#39;t become a complete pseudoskeptic by any means; but at this point I think a lot less weird shit regularly happens than I used to.  It doesn&#39;t happen in every single case, but most strange stories tend to come from someone who wants money, attention/validation/narcissistic supply, or both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this sub is some of the people are anti science, anti discussion and very pro sound bites with links to biased websites. And they just happen to be the noisiest. </p>

<p>If you want to discuss a CT be prepared to back it up with real science and not links to natural news.</p>

<p>The amount if times topics appear on here with the only source being natural news, you ask them for more evidence and you get downvoted to death and flamed. Remember you are trying to persuade me, so the burden of proof lies with you the poster.</p>
