        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I actually posted this once before, but then I deleted it because a lot of people were saying it was not a conspiracy (and the troll comments were annoying). Where else am I really to post this on Reddit, then? Either way, I definitely think there are some conspiracy elements. Also, I&#39;m sorry for the people who posted before and gave a lot of time and effort to their thoughts. I don&#39;t think I will delete it this time. </p>

<p><strong>The Truth about Modern Education</strong></p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> I want to preface this post with a few things. First, I’m finishing up my 5th year of teaching in a very poor area, so my views may be skewed a tad. However, as I have worked with teachers across the United States, and as I work on my master’s degree, I am finding what I am experiencing is becoming the new norm. I also want to explain that I am actually rated very well at my job, and this is not a post of bitterness. I also attended very good schools, so I see the contrast in poor vs. rich schools.
I am posting this on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because I feel this crowd will process it best, as well as provide more information and perspectives. Plus, where else on Reddit would this be well-received? Seriously.</p>

<p>Of course, always be skeptical of what anybody posts, but please know I have no reason to lie, exaggerate, or even waste my time on something like this if I did not feel it would be interesting or important to somebody. Also, it is important to note that there is so much information about this online, but I felt it would be interesting coming from a teacher’s perspective, too! We are often not heard because we are afraid to speak.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s the conspiracy?</strong> ‘They’ are purposely destroying public education in order to eventually privatize education, and they are doing this in a variety of ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/19/4_ways_privatization_is_ruining_our_education_system_partner/">http://www.salon.com/2014/02/19/4_ways_privatization_is_ruining_our_education_system_partner/</a></p>

<p>So, what is happening today is public schools? </p>

<p>• Punish poor schools:  Not only are most schools completely under-funded, with teachers paying much of their materials and supplies out of their pockets, but the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) actually punishes schools with disadvantaged students. Instead of funding schools who need the funding, they take it away.</p>

<p><a href="http://cpr.maxwell.syr.edu/efap/about_efap/ie/dec06.pdf">http://cpr.maxwell.syr.edu/efap/about_efap/ie/dec06.pdf</a></p>

<p>And the propaganda is rampant. How often do you hear about a teacher who is a ‘hero’ for buying her own supplies and feeding her students? I DO DO THIS, but I wish I did not have to. My already small paycheck goes to things that I really cannot afford. The national news can honor a teacher for feeding the poor students in her classroom (saw a news story about this), but you will not hear the question, why should any public school be under-funded? If you really think about this, you will start to realize that if schools were properly funded, most would perform better. I cannot find the article on this at the moment, but I recently read how just upping funding by about 10% is beneficial to a school’s performance. In other words, who would have thought that funding schools help them?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/02/23/studies_find_that_giving_schools_more_money_helps_students_how_bout_that.html">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/02/23/studies_find_that_giving_schools_more_money_helps_students_how_bout_that.html</a></p>

<p>• Take away art, humanities, recess, gym, etc.: I teach English, but kids need a break, and they need an exposure to a variety of subject areas. With more and more pressure to perform, schools are taking away electives. Many schools have cut down on lunch and recess time drastically, and many students do not even have gym class anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://koin.com/2014/09/30/dwindling-recess-times-concern-educators-parents/">http://koin.com/2014/09/30/dwindling-recess-times-concern-educators-parents/</a></p>

<p>• Testing: Do I really need to mention this? Testing is big business, and these testing companies prosper by feeding on poor schools and poor states. We might as well do a salute to Pearson every morning instead of the flag.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/03/30/report-big-education-firms-spend-millions-lobbying-for-pro-testing-policies/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/03/30/report-big-education-firms-spend-millions-lobbying-for-pro-testing-policies/</a></p>

<p>By the way, I’m not against standards for teachers or students, but I can write an entirely different post about why the testing is not done fairly. Let me know what ever questions you have on this topic because it can get long and complicated.</p>

<p>• The McDonaldization of Education: Teachers are now replaceable, and even if they aren’t, it doesn’t matter. Teacher turnover is at an all-time high in most places. Teachers do not last very long anymore for many reasons (burnout), and there is a constant intake of new teachers who do not last very long. The cycle continues. Just like McDonald’s, they are not very concerned about the turnover rate. They can pay new teachers less, and they will always have somebody to fill the job, even a full-time sub. In my district, every year, about 50% of teachers leave.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/four-in-10-new-teachers-quit--a-year">http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/four-in-10-new-teachers-quit--a-year</a></p>

<p>Do you think this is good for the school or the students? It’s not. It takes a long time to become a good teacher, and even the best teachers are rarely that great their first few years.</p>

<p>• Burnout: This is not an exaggeration. Most teachers work 50-60 hours a week or more, and this is true for the majority of teachers I know. They do not get paid more for this most of the time. As I have gained more experience, my workload has lessened, but I do not foresee a day when I will not be overworked. In addition, most new teacher evaluation systems punish teachers for taking days off, and they rate teachers better on how much more work they do. For example, if I wanted to be rated effective in my district, I better make sure I do not take more than 1-2 days off a year, and I better do all that extra work for my principal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/why-do-teachers-quit/280699/">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/why-do-teachers-quit/280699/</a></p>

<p>Oh, and I really feel for the older teachers I work with. Many of them, who have been teaching 20 years, have been recently rated ineffective due to new evaluation protocols. Now, don’t get me wrong, some of these teachers might have had outdated teaching practices, but most teachers were good teachers and did not necessarily deserve an ineffective rating. Sadly, many good teachers left. </p>

<p>• Cookie-cutter teachers: I came up with this term  There is now one good way to teach, and all teachers have to follow this to be rated well. I want to make clear that I am rated well, and I do follow most advice from good research, experience, and mentors. However, personality has been taken out of teaching. Those who are naturally good lecturers cannot do this much anymore, and your students must be constantly working in groups and interacting in order to be ‘learning.’ The thing is, I have learned that a variety of teaching methods work, and a teacher should use a variety of strategies and practices in their classrooms. For example, on Monday I might lecture with some notes, but on Tuesday, students will do an activity in groups. I keep my lessons varied, and because of this, they are usually engaging. The problem is, teachers are not allowed to trust their own judgment.
I know this part may be controversial because we all had that boring teacher who lectured and never even tried, but I can assure you most teachers I meet try not to be that way.
Research matters, but teachers should be allowed to experiment and work with their own personalities. </p>

<p>• Besides, isn’t it ok to be bored?: Students no longer know how to be bored. They must be constantly ‘entertained.’ I am all for engaging education, but I am not a clown. I explain to my students that sometimes life is ‘boring’, and we must learn to accept that and, well, even appreciate that. I actually give my students ‘being bored challenges’, and they love it! I tell new teachers engagement is not necessarily entertainment. With phones, I am deeply concerned for this new generation of students. Call me old-fashioned, but I have even seen a difference in 5 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results">http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results</a></p>

<p>Thank God my school has banned cell phones. I really believe it is beneficial to my students.</p>

<p>• ‘Special Snowflake’ syndrome: Every kid is special and nobody is a loser. This is real, and this is now. Nobody can fail, and parents believe that their student is better than all the others. I am generalizing, and I work with a lot of great parents, but let me tell you this, this type of mentality will have a negative impact on students.</p>

<p>I’m extremely anti-bullying, but I believe in balance, and kids need to see their strengths and their weaknesses. The problem is that criticism is ‘offensive.’ Luckily, I’ve learned how to word things in such a way to get parents on my good side. All teachers aren’t so lucky though.</p>

<p>Don’t get me started on ridiculous special education and gifted accommodations…</p>

<p>• What did the teacher do wrong now?: In the past, students were blamed for that ‘F’ on their report card. Now teachers are blamed for…everything. I love this comic:</p>

<p><a href="http://changingmediagroup.com/in-response-to-the-imaginary-teacher-shortage/">http://changingmediagroup.com/in-response-to-the-imaginary-teacher-shortage/</a></p>

<p>Teachers’ words are no longer trusted. If little Timmy did not do his report, we better blame the teacher! Also, let’s make sure we e-mail the principal and the superintendent before we even speak to the teacher about the issue…</p>

<p>This one is scary. Teachers are not trusted as professionals, and it is quite depressing to be honest. Let me just say this, the teacher is truly and mostly looking out for your child. There are bad apples, but most of us truly want what is best for you and your child. Do us a favor and trust us! At least a little.</p>

<p>• Critical thinking is an illusion: This one is hard to describe, but it is true that students are doing less critical thinking. In fact, they are not even memorizing anymore (I can explain this more if you want). I do not know what is happening. All I know is that students are having a lot of difficulty thinking deeper and more abstractly. Blame the teacher…or blame our society? This one is a blog, but still:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-shmuly-yanklowitz/a-society-with-poor-criti_b_3754401.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-shmuly-yanklowitz/a-society-with-poor-criti_b_3754401.html</a></p>

<p>And memorization is not bad! It takes a lot of memorization to become a good student. How can you critically analyze anything if you have absolutely no academic vocabulary? You need to memorize things!</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not saying critical thinking is not important...bad word choice. I am saying that I do not think critical thinking is really happening in schools. </p>

<p>• Poor…and spoiled?: Across the board, more and more parents are showing love with material items. Poor, rich, ugly, or whatever, parents want to win their children’s love with what they buy them. But will they actually talk to their children? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/spoiled-rotten">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/spoiled-rotten</a></p>

<pre><code>I tell the parents to spoil your children with love, and get off your damn phones!
</code></pre>

<p>• Diet/nutrition: Controversial, I know, but it is not okay for your children to be obese. I love your children no matter what they look like, and the truth is, it is not their fault.</p>

<p>They need energy to play, and it does affect their self-esteem.</p>

<p>Now, I am a woman, and I am extremely insecure, so I know how terrible it can be to hear about my body. BUT, we must find a way to reach our children, and we must do it quickly. </p>

<p>I would never shame a child, and that is not the right way to go about it, but we also need to stop rewarding our kids with food. We need to stop spoiling our children. Yes, children need to exercise, but they also need to eat right. They also need to go outside! And this is not really about school lunches, Michelle Obama. It’s about poverty. </p>

<p>Do I really need a study for this? Just look up childhood obesity in google. But just in case:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/14/health/obesity-affect-school-performance/">http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/14/health/obesity-affect-school-performance/</a></p>

<p>It is affecting our students.</p>

<p>• What happened to curiosity?  This is something I just sense and feel. I really would like to hear comments on this one.</p>

<p>• Everything teachers do is wrong: Not only do teachers struggle with never living up to some sense of perfection, but let’s just make this clear, you have to be very, very careful what you say anymore. Teachers can be fired for anything.
The other day, I jokingly commented about putting tape around a student’s mouth. I was reprimanded. What the ?!?!?</p>

<p>• Grading is not truly a reflection of performance anymore: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_inflation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_inflation</a></p>

<p>• Parent involvement: Parents seriously seem to ‘drop out’ at about middle school, when kids need them most. Besides, if you really want kids to succeed, parent involvement is the most important factor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nea.org/tools/17360.htm">http://www.nea.org/tools/17360.htm</a></p>

<p>• Discipline: This one is extremely complex. Luckily, I rely on solid classroom managements strategies in my classroom, and for any new teachers reading, I will help you. But, I honestly believe discipline is black and white now. It is either way too way lenient or way too extreme.</p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2015/03/14/politicians-are-making-schools-less-safe-and-ruining-education-for-everyone/">http://nypost.com/2015/03/14/politicians-are-making-schools-less-safe-and-ruining-education-for-everyone/</a></p>

<p>Oh, and don’t even let me tell you how many parents have told me they just cannot control their children anymore…</p>

<p>Conclusion: I could probably go on and on, but I need to stop somewhere. I’m not here to say teachers are perfect or that it is never the teacher’s fault. Rather, I am showing you how education is slowly being destroyed, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
I do not know what can be done, but I do know it is happening. What I ask is that you at least support your teachers, and know that most of really do want what is best for your children. </p>

<p>I do think this is part of a larger agenda, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. If you read through this all, I really appreciate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is quite depressing as it is the exact opposite of how I was raised. I can sum it up by saying that people are being domesticated not educated.</p>

<p>Solutions: nothing short of a complete cultural re-boot, unfortunately. I really see no other option. The current system is not geared to allow for critical thinking, creative thought, or any kind of progressive education. </p>

<p>I feel for the teachers though. A friend I went to school with decided to pursue a career in education after high school. He really wanted to &quot;make a difference&quot;. Five years after starting, he quit and took a maintenance job with the county. He has nothing good to say about the current system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your thorough and well thought out post. I would like to comment on one of your points in regards to curiosity. </p>

<p>I believe that curiosity is the last thing TPTB want because that leads down the path of critical thinking, which you mentioned briefly. Not sure what you meant when you said critical thinking is an illusion?  </p>

<p>However, critical thinking is pivotal in understanding the world around you, more specifically how it works, and interacts with ones own life. Throwing a wrench in this skill set is of great interest for them because it (in most cases) causes the individual to live in fear and/or uncertainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this could be long and in-depth, I think the first solution is to make parent involvement a number one priority at every age level, in every district across this country.</p>

<p>When parents are involved, then teachers can more easily promote literacy at home and get more support from home and projects. I think parent involvement would fix a lot of the issues..</p>

<p>BUT the conspiracy is I think that they are purposely destroying education so that within 20 years or so schools would all be privatized.</p>

<p>We need unions. We need people angry. We need protests.</p>

<p>Is that going to happen?</p>

<p>It could but this is what in sad. Around where I work, tons of parents and students protested testing and refused to take tests or walked on. You better believe stuff like that wasn&#39;t often making national news...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Universities aren&#39;t really havens for critical thinking either.  The best way to pass a class in college is to parrot everything your professor says.  They will only grade your papers favorably if they agree with you.  Grad school isn&#39;t any better - in fact, it can be worse in many ways.  Ph.D programs especially are rife with professor politics.</p>

<p>The only small taste of critical thinking I got in college was in the intro to philosophy class I took.  And even then, I really only understood critical thinking by asking the professor for a logic textbook, so I could pass the logic portion of the GMAT.  I never had a class that covered the material of basic logical thinking, or how to build a logical argument, or how to identify logical fallacies.  I&#39;m glad I read the textbook on the side - it was one of the first mental game-changers for me.</p>

<p>The central mindset of education is so limiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try this, it worked great to alleviate my personal back problems: when you lie down to go to sleep, lie on your back with your arms out a little bit at your sides, palms up.  It will be a bit uncomfortable at first probably but just try to stay in that position as long as you can, ideally falling asleep with it.  It helps to strengthen and straighten your back and improves your posture, and for me it relieved a lot of back and neck pain I was having.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An author, historian, and former teacher named John Taylor Gatto has written incisively about modern schooling. Look him up, some of his books are presented online for free. His basic argument is that the modern system really ramped up in the early 20th century, when American elites were facing millions of poor, urban, mostly Catholic immigrants and needed a way of controlling them. They imported the Prussian military model and married it to behaviorist psychology, and voila, American schooling on an industrial scale. Most of this wasn&#39;t even funded by the government but by Carnegie, Morgan, Rockefeller, and other tycoons.</p>

<p>US education is being dumbed down so rapidly in part because it&#39;s highly centralized. Decision-making is increasingly being taken out of the hands of the local community, and is being placed in the hands of DC bureaucrats and &quot;experts&quot; from academia and privately funded think tanks and foundations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting how the US ties its military to college. They make sure that the people who get a shot at college are people who aren&#39;t going to make a difference and are absent of critical thought and independence. That ties into the debt slave portion of US society. </p>

<p>I think America has it&#39;s priorities backwards. Instead of equal opportunity, they should be funding schools and giving the intelligent kids a better chance. But that will never happen. There&#39;s too much emphasis on kids as a whole and on equality and equal opportunity and the wefare that goes with it.</p>

<p>I also find equal opportunity distracts people from the fact that there are way too many minorities with very little promise having way too many children and they are tying up the system as far as demand and welfare. Of course, this wouldn&#39;t be as big of a problem if the US didn&#39;t spend trillions on warfare.</p>

<p>I agree with you 100% on the recess, gym, art portion. Kids are being trained to tolerate factory conditions, and although many of them are not going to be honour students, they should all be encouraged to express themselves, be creative, think critically and get some exercise. That should be at least a 3rd of the curriculum. However, this isn&#39;t what the corporate foundations of the world want. They want kids trained to accept the corporate world and not one of free thought and free lifestyle.</p>

<p>I also find your comments on the McDonaldization of education very important. I remember seeing this as a student and never paid it any thought until after I was finished. Throughout my education I saw teachers teaching multiple subjects and teachers coming and going and it was insane. Kids form personal attachments to their teachers (the good ones) and this is being stripped away with the extension of the assembly line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every kid is special and nobody is a loser. I’m extremely anti-bullying, but I believe in balance,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am 100% against this anti-bully campaign that has swept the West. It is nothing but a distraction centered on isolated cases and it&#39;s being used to further the fascist grip on children. Kids are going to fight and the weak ones are going to be weeded out. It&#39;s natural law. Most of the time it&#39;s just harmless name-calling. Yes there are serious, isolated, incidents and they should be handled as such. Treating every kid like a criminal is wrong. They are kids and they are working off millions of years of evolution and a piece of that evolved brain is social morality. Most of the time this works itself out. They don&#39;t need regulations to tell them that violence is wrong. I find it disgusting that they are being manipulated by liberal interests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critical THinking is an illusion. And memorization is not bad! It takes a lot of memorization to become a good student. How can you critically analyze anything if you have absolutely no academic vocabulary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to disagree. Obviously you need to remember material in order to work out a thought on the subject, but education today teaches blatant lies about history and doesn&#39;t encourage a 2-sided reflection. It also concentrates too much on dates and names and not enough on context and actual experience. </p>

<p>I was really interested in history in school and loved to debate and argue but I found later that what I was taught was wrong and I was debating the wrong side and using bad arguments to win. I&#39;ve learned a lot more on my own since then. I&#39;ve also learned that it&#39;s not enough to simply learn the facts, but to learn the context and to understand that publishing companies are influenced by foundations that are fueled by cultural Marxism and corporate desire, not truth and honesty. And like you said, people are afraid to challenge the system and a system without audit is a system doomed to failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teachers’ words are no longer trusted. If little Timmy did not do his report, we better blame the teacher! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably just another result of the McDonaldization of education. We treat fast food employees and teachers with the same regard now. The once personal nature of schools is gone. And this is because 1) there are too many unintelligent breeders flooding the system with their snowflakes, 2) the system promotes a factory setting and 3) there&#39;s too much emphasis on immigration and giving up our prosperity to a world that can&#39;t take care of each other and thus we end up not being able to take care of ourselves and 4) the system is corrupt with regards to financial spending.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diet/nutrition: Controversial, I know, but it is not okay for your children to be obese.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this topic to be ridiculous. It&#39;s the parent&#39; responsibility to feed their kids. And a chocolate bar and pop isn&#39;t going to kill them. Fat people with fat kids are not the responsibility of everyone. They should take care of themselves. And they should foot the bill. We can&#39;t fix stupid. Some of them are physically inclined to be overweight, that&#39;s just natural. </p>

<p>Restrictions on kids and schools is wrong. What the government should be doing is regulating big business and their advertisements. Keep your hands out of the schools and all over the corporations who fill their products with toxic materials and advertise to children. Less emphasis on free market and more on actual freedom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They need energy to play</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They need to play to burn off the energy. Sitting in a factory all day after eating doesn&#39;t do a thing for these kids.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I honestly believe discipline is black and white now. It is either way too way lenient or way too extreme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. Cops in schools is a big problem. Seeing little kids man-handled by police is one of the most disgusting things I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and don’t even let me tell you how many parents have told me they just cannot control their children anymore…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This feeds into the whole nanny state, leftist push. Sponsored by corporations who need worker bees. Create a society based around sensationalism with regards to every little thing imaginable (gender, bullying, food, race etc..) so that the people forget how to simply live with each other, under a state that not only pokes its nose into every facet of life, creating a hostile environment, but then make the people completely reliant on the corporate state financially also with regards to information.</p>

<p>This is all an elaborate plan and education is just a small portion of the work that&#39;s being done by the owners. Keep people from teaching themselves. Keep them from being properly active in the community as corporate foundations dictate right, wrong and morality and basically streamline the process of activity to steer them away from making changes that might harm top-level desires. Isolate the media to make sure they don&#39;t see any problems with the system. Push cultural Marxism and dialectical Marxism in shaping society so the population is busy fighting itself rather than the corruption from above. Privatize everything in order to take power away from the people and put it into the hands of a select few. Education is simply feeling the effect of globalism. A world government of private materialists who want everyone to mix together and forget their cultures and desires for independence and to be completely reliant on a system that is only accountable profit margins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to post everything you need to be talked about here :) one thing tho, it feels like every post is all around the US while stuff can be different in the other parts of the world. I still appreciate them tho, as i can get a first hand idea of how bad the situation is there as sadly it will reflect how stuff will go in the rest of the world.
Yes teaching is def a hard work and i feel like you are doing great, especially since you are an &quot;awake&quot; teacher, it&#39;s really bad you won&#39;t be able to completely awake your students tho. (You can&#39;t really get them to question everything if you are their teacher).
Just be vigilant of what may come in the future and always try to hide the fact thar you are awake. Some time ago if i could speak with myself of right now i would&#39;ve called myself crazy i think. Stuff is really that bad and is getting worse. I hope i&#39;m just wrong tho who knows. Sorry if i made some english mistakes here and there, it&#39;s late here and english is not ny first language, this comment has become more of a pm than a reply but whatever i guess</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just my pet theory, but to me it seems that the &quot;powers that be&quot; are trying to turn the US into Latin America. As someone who lives in that region, I&#39;m not trying to say anything bad about Latin American people - I&#39;m talking about the huge sweeping social changes that were introduced in the 20th century by US puppet dictatorships. </p>

<p>If we look at education in Chile today, the public schools have been starved of funding for so long that they essentially function as babysitting services. Any parent who wants their child to get a serious education has to send their child to a private school. To think &quot;Oh, but that&#39;s just how Latin America is&quot; is not really correct and is in fact slightly offensive, because you can look back at the history of public vs private educational institutions and see that before the Cold War public institutions had a long and proud history. It was a deliberate change on the part of some group of people. </p>

<p>Nearly everything you&#39;ve observed starting to appear in the US already exists in a big way here. Especially the &quot;Mcdonaldization of education&quot;, the revolving door of employment, and the advantage that cookie cutter teachers have over teachers who want to think for themselves. </p>

<p>I think that the same people trying to transform the US today are the ones who already used Latin American countries as a testing ground for these kinds of things decades ago. In all areas of society, not just education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have one small request. NEVER spend your own money on teaching materials. This should come from budget. If there is no budget, it is not your responsibility. You might ask the parents to pay. But, even this is way out of line really.</p>

<p>When you buy materials, you create an expectation/performance level that everyone must do this, or they will not be able to have the same type of class as yours. You are single so maybe you can afford it, but many teachers cannot. You should not fall for the system&#39;s cons like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your great post. </p>

<p>If you teach English, could you please try to teach the kids how to spell the words they are learning? English spelling is screwy and you need to memorize the words, but it seems to be no longer taught. They seem to focus on higher level analysis without ever doing the nuts and bolts stuff. (of course, it is easier that way)</p>

<p>A great deal of what you write about is related to the desire of the people on top to remain on top. Part of it is racism, where whites feel threatened by the rise of blacks, hispanics, and asians. The other part is classism where the 1% wants to suppress the rest. And part of it is that the 99% just do not realize that they are already totally dumbed down and suppressed, and therefore, they do not understand that their &quot;discovery&quot; that the earth is round is not shocking to the rest of us.</p>

<p>Basically, education is funded by property taxes, so poor districts get shitty education. Until this changes, nothing will change.</p>

<p>Education has been turned into a big business. They do not care about the product as long as they can turn a profit. See also loans for university. All of this stuff is related to the US&#39;s status as a slave state/colony in the international system, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I hope you can avoid burnout. It is very easy to get burned out. You need to protect your own physical health. You also need to try to protect your own mental health. It is very easy to lose it in an insane system. You need to try to be centered and not be too affected by any one outcome or system change. Just sorta nod and ignore the stuff that you can get away with ignoring. </p>

<p>I think you should try to do your own thing and experiment as to what works with your personality. I dislike the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; approach, but of course not everyone is a star, so they need some help to meet a minimum level of performance. I like the idea of clear goals and meeting those goals, but that is just me...</p>

<p>Being bored is Ok/good, and learning is not always easy. Can you do Calculus? I ask because this is a good question for English teachers! Jus keepin&#39; it real, homie!</p>

<p>The results of the test are real. If you got a 50%, that means that special snowflake needs to go back and relearn. This never actually happens of course, we just go on to the next module...</p>

<p>Being extremely anti-bulling is correct in my opinion. Violence has no place in school. Even name-calling can fuck up a kid in some cases. It really does not belong in society or in school. </p>

<p>I think you should document everything to protect yourself. Esp. for a problem student/parent. If you scan all their work into the computer, you can put it all on a memory stick. You need a record when shit hits fan. </p>

<p>US food is shit. It has been made that way for profit for the corporations and the 1%. This is a bigger problem and hard to fix.</p>

<p>Disipline is hard to handle. Do you have any good tips?</p>

<p>The society itself is imploding so that education should fail too is not much of a surprise. </p>

<p>It is good that you have a job, but you should try to move to a richer district imho. You will get better pay, kids, classes, equipment, everything. You got some experience now, so maybe depending on your situation, you can move?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  And it&#39;s permeatting to university.  I&#39;m an American that taught chemical engineering and nanotechnology engineering to university students in Canada for nearly a decade.  I came back to the US, due to family issues, and I&#39;m also a professor here (mateirals engineering) in the states.  I can honestly say, that I&#39;d send my children to school in either Canada or Europe for their undergraduate education, long before any state school in the US -- there are still good private and ivy league schools.  My wife and I plan to home school.  Education in the US is in a really sad state.  My wife, who is an English professor, is shocked by how poorly Americans can write and their lack of critical thinking skills.  She just says &quot;lowered expectations&quot; and as long as they are willing to turn in their work, she gives them a low, albeit, passing mark.  Even so, she fails over a third of her students becuase they can&#39;t be bothered to even turn in the work.  I could go on and on about this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  I have a few, really great, smart, students.  At the same time, overall there&#39;s this entitlement philosophy that has become a part of their psyche.  It&#39;s not a problem that&#39;s just at my univeristy either.  I&#39;ve spoken with colleagues at other universities, and they also see this trend.  My wife REALLY tries to teach critical thinking, but it&#39;s hard to undo years of damage in two (at most) semesters.  There are still some amazing students that we both see, and it&#39;s those few that keep us both smiling re: our jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that the last 4 years of my life have been all about undoing the damage of 12 years of public education. The internet has been an invaluable tool in doing so, but I&#39;m old enough to understand that reading and researching and critical thinking only can come from within.</p>

<p>I have two boys - one is almost 2 and the other is almost 2 weeks - and I am completely terrified about sending them to school. My almost 2 year old is curious and inquisitive and a quick study, and nothing would break my heart more than a school system that completely suppresses that in him. I&#39;m seriously considering home schooling.</p>

<p>The very least I can do is create a home that fosters curiosity and learning and hopefully I can fill in the gaps that school will inevitably leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say, as a middle aged mom, and one who has worked in teh school system of the ..lower class.. this is spot on. I have raised fucking HELL for years about how our school was funded and treated, vs those in the same district in more money rich areas, to fall on deaf ears. I spent years sadly having to fight to get my kids into a charter school.. they are there now, but who is left to fight for the lesser schools? </p>

<p>Both my husband and I are well educated, and it&#39;s something we strive for in our kids, but the schools and honestly the DISTRICT fight it so hard. I have to say I disagree with the chant about common core (I&#39;m a fan, my husband&#39;s a fan, a lot of those in education I know are fans.. it depends on your state/area) but I 110% agree the drive today is for pushing towards privatization - those who can afford the education get it. The rest of us are left with - if you&#39;re lucky - a lottery for charter, and if not welcome to a half ass education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who graduated last year I know most of my classmates are aware that the public education system has failed us. I know because our teachers and even our principle told us that on multiple occasions. Another way I know is because I was able to not do anything an still pass, I took the finals in all my classes and passed. </p>

<p>I know exactly what you mean by there is no critical thinking though. No one thinks anymore and I think it&#39;s not because were lazy or that we think were too smart; I think it&#39;s because we know deep down that we know the system is bullshit we know that this system is here strictly to prep us for a life of mediocrity. In the workforce until were too old to be useful to the system and were tossed out into the street (because we all know social security won&#39;t be there anymore when my generation is old enough for it). I hated school because I knew it was a waste of time just biding my time for college where I may actually learn something. They taught us to be obedient and in our last year my class put forth legislation in my town to try to change education locally. Know what happened ? The government came in replaced our principle and told my class that dissent will not be tolerated, that we had no choice but allow them to keep up the crap they are teaching there. My sisters go there now and say that a lot changed in a year. More police 20 officers and 10 canniness for sniffing out my schools marijuana problem, when they should be worried about the heroin that students are doing in the bathrooms and finally a tall military teacher who wears his uniform on campus, all because of a little legislation for some better education. </p>

<p>We need more dissent more students calling out the government, more students not pledging themselves to the corporations flag like they did in my school. If this is radical oh well I want major change in the us I want my countrymen and women to have a chance at an actual life. Not one where you are forced to work 50-60 hours a week like my mom does LIKE YOU DO I don&#39;t want people to have to fill their &quot;home&quot; with items that they will never use because they are always working. I want people to be able to know their children will have educational opportunities that will not crush them with debt. I want to see these bought politicians dragged out of their offices and thrown onto the street by the people who&#39;s lives they&#39;ve destroyed because of their greed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a 19 year old who graduated High School only 2 years ago, what you say lines up perfectly with how I feel about my high school experience here in the Bronx. Teaching to the tests is one of the main things that really rubbed me the wrong way. I went to the third worst HS in the city (in many classes there were not enough seats, so students had to stand or sit on the radiator the whole period if you didn&#39;t get a seat) and throughout the year my teachers kept repeating this line: &quot;you need to know this [subject matter] because it will be on the regents exam!&quot; (Regents is a NY State test that must be passed in order to graduate). On one hand I thought it was because my peers would feel cheated if they were learning things without a reason behind having to learn it (learning for the sake of learning was a foreign concept to them, and because many of them had no respect whatsoever for our teachers, things could very quickly get ugly, physical violence wasn&#39;t off the table for many), but on the other hand it was more because the teachers didn&#39;t want too many of their students failing the Regents lest they be out of a job. The funny part about this was that after a few months, I became disenfranchised with school because of how appallingly bad my school was. I refused to do homework as I regarded it waste of my time (I&#39;d rather explore abandoned military forts and NIKE missile sites on old creepy islands on my dad&#39;s boat, go fishing, or read a book, etc.). I barely did any class work, though I did participate and help the class along when we got hung up on something (usually just said the answer out loud after a while of blank stares and blurted out incorrect answers and guesses from my peers). At the end of the year when it was time to take the Regents, which we were being groomed for the entire year, despite me intentionally getting bare-minimum grades (65 to pass) I got 80s and 90s on said exams without studying so much as a second. I had asked to take all the Regents at once to prove I knew the material so that I could graduate early and put the shitshow that was my old high &quot;school&quot; (the only thing &quot;high&quot; about that place were the kids smoking blunts and doing lines off the sink in the bathrooms, I wish I was kidding) behind me. Of course, this was denied as they wanted my ass in their often times non-existent seat so that they could get the funding from my presence. Oh well, I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s behind me, and that someone on the &quot;other side&quot; shares similar sentiments with myself. Thank you for writing this OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I too was a public school teacher until this school year. Burn-out is a real thing and I was so tired of the crap that goes along with being a teacher. </p>

<p>I could go on and on. I lost one teaching job for hosting a town hall meeting with my student&#39;s congressman. The kids asked conspiracy style questions and I was asked to step down from my position as AP gov/econ teacher (even though I&#39;ve won lots of teaching awards and have good AP scores). </p>

<p>Overall, the idea that the teacher can reach all the kids is a joke. At my last job, I had gifted students and severely mentally retarded kids in the same 8th grade classroom. Yet somehow I&#39;m supposed to teach them about the philosophical differences between Jefferson and Hamilton&#39;s banking ideas. This task is nearly impossible when even the brightest kids have zero background in anything finance- related. I&#39;m also supposed to customize lessons for the Special Ed (SPED) kids daily so that they can be mainstreamed. </p>

<p>I hated this. It caused all kinds of problems in the classroom &quot;Why does Ted get easier homework?&quot; I can&#39;t say, &quot;because Ted is SPED.&quot; Those kids need a special class. I also had no additional help for those students and spent the majority of my time dealing with those low level kids instead of teaching the higher level students.</p>

<p>Everything is all about the test. Teachers are shamed for test score issues even though we often get kids in our class who cannot read or do the basics. Kids are passed up because no one wants to deal with the nightmare that comes with failing a kid. It&#39;s insane! </p>

<p>Discipline really depends on the administration. Sometimes, you send a kid whose acting up to the office and the principal sends them right back or does nothing so the behavior becomes encouraged. Disruptive kids need to be removed from the learning environment but often the admin does not want to deal with it. Or they blame you for not being able to handle it.</p>

<p>True story, this incident occurred between two of my students in their physics class a few years ago: a black kid punched a white kid in the face in the middle of class. The black kid, and his father, tells the principal that at some point in the past, the white kid called the black kid a nigger, so the white kid ended up getting 3 days suspension while the black kid had zero punishment. What the hell? It&#39;s PC gone mad. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had parents pull the &quot;I don&#39;t know how to handle my kid&quot; card. They ask me what to do. Is it that hard to deal with their kids? A lot of parents just want their kids warehoused for the day where they don&#39;t have to worry about them. Learning is a vestigial concern.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on the pushing college to everyone crap. Learning skilled trades is never discussed and no one talks about the massive amount of student loan debt these kids (many of whom can barely read) are about to get themselves into. It&#39;s disgusting. </p>

<p>Public education is a huge joke. Too much brainwashing. All the good teachers leave. I can barely form sentences now because I&#39;m too angry thinking about all the awfulness of the system. Plus, I&#39;m still bitter about that town hall thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom&#39;s a longtime public school teacher (elementary school) and I&#39;ve heard a lot of what you said from her as well.  A few comments; I think more often than not it&#39;s misappropriation of funds as opposed to lack of funding.  I know in Boston that&#39;s absolutely the case.  </p>

<p>Standardized testing shouldn&#39;t be totally eliminated but the practice of gearing all of the curriculum towards doing well on specific standardized tests needs to be abolished.  Where this gets complicated is that if it&#39;s tied to funding schools will keep the focus on it.  It hurts the kids but we all know that it&#39;s about $ not a kid&#39;s education.  There needs to be a better way of evaluating the quality of schools.  I think all education matters should be handled at a state level so that they can be more closely monitored and have their own standards. </p>

<p>Ultimately I think a lot of these problems start with poor parenting.  Parents are over worked and their kids are overly stimulated with technology and eat like shit.  There also seem to be two extremes, either their kid is the perfect snowflake who can do no wrong or the parent(s) have no involvement whatsoever.  </p>

<p>One thing you didn&#39;t mention is the percentage of kids nowadays who are on adderall or a similar medication.  The rates at which kids are prescribed these drugs has sky rocketed through the last 10 years.  It&#39;s become a crutch for parents and I think so many kids being on these 24/7 ties into a bunch of the behavior issues you&#39;re seeing.  </p>

<p>&quot;What happened to curiosity? This is something I just sense and feel. I really would like to hear comments on this one.&quot; </p>

<p>Could you elaborate? To me this is the most chilling comment in your post...  Not sure where to begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well students now have the world at their fingertips, and I honestly believe it is informational overload for them.</p>

<p>By the time they&#39;re in middle school, many students are not curious to learn because let&#39;s be honest, they can look up things online whenever they feel like. There is no longer an urgency to learn.</p>

<p>I am not saying this is true of all students. Instead, though the ones who utilize technology more are more prone to being complacent.</p>

<p>For one, most of their time is spent with entertainment when it comes to technology.</p>

<p>Second, they often read biased new sources without knowing how to critically evaluate. When something challenges their world view, they might have difficulty with that.</p>

<p>Third, and trust me I&#39;m not old-fashioned, there is no wonder in reading anymore, especially from books. Reading is simply boring too students and it really hard for them to focus. Reading is not entertainment anymore - unless it&#39;s a Huffington post article with a biased opinion that already relates to their world view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a friend that&#39;s a teacher, and their description of teaching matches your description 100%.</p>

<p>Overwork - they work about 50-60 hours a week, usually putting in 2-3 hours a night from home (unpaid of course).</p>

<p>Low salary - the typical argument is that teachers only work &quot;half of the year,&quot; which is true in some respects.  However, for a job that requires the level of commitment that teaching does, most people would not accept the salary that most teachers make (usually between $30-45k, depending on subject and qualifications).  I thought $70k was too little when I worked similar hours at a corporate job.</p>

<p>Limited mindset - They work in an inner-city school, and they see the worst of the mindsets.  Kids think that all they&#39;ll ever be is a laborer at a factory, or some hourly job.  They think learning is useless.</p>

<p>Parent involvement - They also talk about how parents are never involved, or if they are, they blame the teachers for their child&#39;s poor performance.  Parents never think about all of the limiting, negative cognitions they give their kids.  &quot;It&#39;s ok that you&#39;re not good at math, you&#39;ll never need it for a job anyways.&quot;  &quot;We&#39;re too poor to break out of this neighborhood, there ain&#39;t no sense in trying.&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re no good, your daddy/momma was never any good, their parents were never any good.&quot;  And that&#39;s assuming that they are home and talk to their children.  A lot of parents work multiple jobs, or work night shifts, and never really see their kids.  It&#39;s usually the ones that never see their kids that spoil them the most, reinforcing the mindset that little parental involvement is good.</p>

<p>Privatization - They work at a charter school, which they hate very much.  It is taking funds from public schools, charging a higher price per student, offering lower accountability for spending, and providing an equivalent education at best.</p>

<p>Lunches - kids these days get 20 minutes for lunch.  That&#39;s not enough time to really sit and enjoy a meal.  Their diet choices are limited by their funds.  Where I went to school was in an extremely rural/poor community, so we got absolute shit food.  Pizza, corn, and tossed salad was the meal every Monday.  Chicken nuggets and fries were a common meal.  Some of the richer schools have more options, but usually also have shit food.  One line for pizza.  One line for burgers.  And an ice cream freezer at the end of every line.  The body and mind cannot function on such low-quality food.  Any energy only lasts as long as the sugar buzz lasts, which is maybe 2 hours at the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for writing this! I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not alone in my thoughts. I&#39;d say I work through summer anyway when it comes to lesson planning and all.</p>

<p>Plus the breaks are really needed for the students even more than the teachers possibly.</p>

<p>And as corny of an argument this is, why aren&#39;t teachers valued as much as other notable professions like nurses or doctors? Kill me for saying this, but we should at least get salary increases! </p>

<p>And omg the taxes taken out of my paychecks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem!  I agree teachers aren&#39;t really valued in society.  We generally see them as professional babysitters.  Someone to entertain the kids while the adults go to work (generally a slave-like corporate or factory job).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then as a teacher, you ask yourself: How far can I go to do my best for these kids, and go against the establishment, and still keep my job? Not very far I&#39;d imagine, it&#39;s a conundrum. </p>

<p>Catering towards children&#39;s personal desires should always be priority, instead of forcing down ideological material from textbooks (most of which just end up being scientific assumptions at best) and make them regurgitate the material as fact on a piece of paper later on. I see you paying close attention to the behavior, treatment, measures of respect and resources given to the children, which is PARAMOUNT, but I also believe that having the right material to teach the children is equally important.</p>

<p>Not that you can help it, honestly... Unless you look towards homeschooling, perhaps? I&#39;m not sure. Perhaps go down the School of Rock (great movie btw) route and expose the classroom to the polar opposites of what they&#39;ve been lead to believe, and inevitably lose your job, which I&#39;m sure you have no intentions of doing... mostly tinkering with myself here.</p>

<p>Like I said it&#39;s a paradox, how do you do your little part in the world and make the cogwheel of change turn if the entire system you&#39;re forced to operate in is so deeply fixated against anything suggested thus far? I wish I had more tips and tricks for you... really good post btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent list of identifying problems.</p>

<p>But as for motives, I see privatization as simply profiteering-come-lately. The purpose of public schooling retains many of its original purposes: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Marginalize the Catholic schools and faith</p></li>
<li><p>Create factory workers who work as a &quot;team&quot; (e.g. through team sports that suddenly came on the scene at about the same time as public schools in the 19th century) instead of self-sufficient individual thinkers</p></li>
<li><p>Social engineering (so effective and quick that within a single presidency, Obama campaigned on anti-gay marriage and now it&#39;s illegal to choose to not be an active participant in a gay marriage)</p></li>
<li><p>Indoctrination into &quot;patriotism&quot; (supporting imperialism) through the Pledge of Allegiance and heroification of presidents.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of conspiracies come about by the coincidental aligning of goals of the powerful, like how the CIA, the mafia, and LBJ all happened to want JFK dead.</p>

<p>After 150 years of the public school conspiracy, they&#39;ve figured out how to, hey, make some money on the side at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate the thought and effort you put into your post. Education is a critical topic and discussing it is highly worthwhile. I&#39;ll focus on the conspiracy idea because that&#39;s this sub but I&#39;ll toss in personal thoughts at the end.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any conspiracy in education currently. Exploring privatization in education has been going on for a very long time. It was limited to higher levels but is now being explored at lower levels as well. I see this exploration as a manifestation of America&#39;s extreme corporate culture while European education systems are a result of their much more state driven culture. I have a definite affinity to the Euro model as my user name might hint at, but I work hard to maintain objectivity when considering the value of a corporate driven education model.  So no conspiracy, simply an extension of American culture into education.</p>

<p>The rest of my thoughts on issues you raised:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>More funding isn&#39;t the answer 9 times out of 10. Better spending on proven results is my first, second and third option. ie. Mismanagement of funds. </p></li>
<li><p>Funding should be tied to results...always and more so in the future. Good to discuss how best to measure results but a results driven system is critical. The decline of the Soviet Union was founded on a disconnection to results.</p></li>
<li><p>Standardized testing is critical. Most of the arguments I&#39;ve read against it don&#39;t hold water. It helps to identify problems which is good when the system then moves to fix those problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Standardization of educational methods is more a reaction to past poor performance. McDonalds is an incredibly good standardized product. Sure it&#39;s not healthy, but don&#39;t mistake one for the other. The model T Ford was another great standardized product. Individual innovation can be great but it needs to show results and not simply be &#39;personal flair&#39;. I think that in the past teaching was left to individuals to figure out &#39;their style&#39; far too much. </p></li>
<li><p>Being overworked is society wide and not limited to education. Whole separate topic.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Teachers are not trusted as professionals&quot;  Here is where you&#39;re not going to like me, if that already hasn&#39;t happened. I don&#39;t see teachers as &#39;professionals&#39;. I see them as workers in an educational system. I see them as implementing a very well researched plan to educate children. Not freelancing professionals that decide what they&#39;ll focus on teaching and how they&#39;ll go about doing that teaching.  I think the &#39;professionals&#39; are at the top of the education system, determining best practices, best curriculum, best testing methods. Apologies if that offends, but it&#39;s my thoughts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll end there. Thanks again for the great post and thoughtful discussion of a very important topic. </p>

<p>I think the conspiracy is that the public is generally unaware that public education may be the thing of the past. I think this agenda is largely hidden.</p>

<p>I agree here. Funding is not the answer, but it definitely is something to be considered in schools that are not receiving proper funding.</p>

<p>It is critical. But it has been corrupted by major corporations.</p>

<p>Not only are most schools completely under-funded</p>

<p>Citation? My local school district has one of the highest per-pupil expenditures (~$21,000) and highest teacher salaries (average $76,000) in the country. We still have a less than 50% graduation rate. </p>

<p>That&#39;s 40%... so the other 60% do get their fair share? Had you said &quot;some&quot; schools are underfunded, I would probably agree with you, but it&#39;s both disingenuous and false to state that &quot;most&quot; are. </p>

<p>Thanks for your great post. </p>

<p>If you teach English, could you please try to teach the kids how to spell the words they are learning? English spelling is screwy and you need to memorize the words, but it seems to be no longer taught. They seem to focus on higher level analysis without ever doing the nuts and bolts stuff. (of course, it is easier that way)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Omg! I am actually hosting a spelling bee on my own this year. My students&#39; spelling is atrocious, and it is directly related to their lack of reading. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A great deal of what you write about is related to the desire of the people on top to remain on top. Part of it is racism, where whites feel threatened by the rise of blacks, hispanics, and asians. The other part is classism where the 1% wants to suppress the rest. And part of it is that the 99% just do not realize that they are already totally dumbed down and suppressed, and therefore, they do not understand that their &quot;discovery&quot; that the earth is round is not shocking to the rest of us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, education is funded by property taxes, so poor districts get shitty education. Until this changes, nothing will change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a greater conspiracy here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Education has been turned into a big business. They do not care about the product as long as they can turn a profit. See also loans for university. All of this stuff is related to the US&#39;s status as a slave state/colony in the international system, in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope you can avoid burnout. It is very easy to get burned out. You need to protect your own physical health. You also need to try to protect your own mental health. It is very easy to lose it in an insane system. You need to try to be centered and not be too affected by any one outcome or system change. Just sorta nod and ignore the stuff that you can get away with ignoring. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you. These words mean a lot. I honestly almost lost my mind the first few years of teaching. I&#39;m at a better place now, but that took a lot of work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you should try to do your own thing and experiment as to what works with your personality. I dislike the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; approach, but of course not everyone is a star, so they need some help to meet a minimum level of performance. I like the idea of clear goals and meeting those goals, but that is just me...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely do my own thing :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being bored is Ok/good, and learning is not always easy. Can you do Calculus? I ask because this is a good question for English teachers! Jus keepin&#39; it real, homie!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a nerd and seriously loved all subject areas in school. I was good at math, science, everything. I even taught science :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results of the test are real. If you got a 50%, that means that special snowflake needs to go back and relearn. This never actually happens of course, we just go on to the next module...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haha yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being extremely anti-bulling is correct in my opinion. Violence has no place in school. Even name-calling can fuck up a kid in some cases. It really does not belong in society or in school. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, I&#39;ll do what I can to protect kids from bullying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you should document everything to protect yourself. Esp. for a problem student/parent. If you scan all their work into the computer, you can put it all on a memory stick. You need a record when shit hits fan. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I absolutely do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>US food is shit. It has been made that way for profit for the corporations and the 1%. This is a bigger problem and hard to fix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disipline is hard to handle. Do you have any good tips?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have so many tips for teachers. Do you want more for teachers or parents?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The society itself is imploding so that education should fail too is not much of a surprise. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a surprise. I should have known better. At least I have a job...</p>
