        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Fresno County Sheriff has officially ruled Police Accountability activist, John Lang&#39;s death a suicide.  </p>

<p>He set his own house on fire, then stabbed himself in the abdomen and back and then waited to die... This is the narrative they would have you believe.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s make his story undeniably famous.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/i7Acy">https://imgur.com/a/i7Acy</a></p>

<p>EDIT: anyone coming in cold, this will bring you up to speed:  <a href="http://fresnopeoplesmedia.com/2016/01/2829/">http://fresnopeoplesmedia.com/2016/01/2829/</a></p>

<p>EDIT2: Above link seems to be broken or slow, here&#39;s another : <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/fresno-whistleblower-dies-in-suspicious-fire-after-warning-that-cops-would-kill-him/213202/">http://www.mintpressnews.com/fresno-whistleblower-dies-in-suspicious-fire-after-warning-that-cops-would-kill-him/213202/</a></p>

<p>EDIT3: Here is how local MSM is reporting:  <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/crime/article56494078.html">http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/crime/article56494078.html</a></p>

<p>EDIT4:  I called and reached out to the Fresno County Coroner&#39;s office for a statement.  They informed me that the Head Coroner in charge of Lang&#39;s case is on vacation for 2 weeks.  They then pointed me towards the Fresno County Sheriff Public Information Officer saying he&#39;d be able to provide more information to the public.  I reached out to him and left a message.  I would encourage as many of you to call and leave him a message asking for him to make a public statement to the media... let him know that there is a huge interest in this case and we want answers.  His information is public knowledge via the Fresno Sheriff website so I see no issue posting his professional contact info here:</p>

<p>Tony Botti
Public Information Officer
(559) 600-8137
(559) 977-0379
<a href="mailto:Tony.Botti@fresnosheriff.org">Tony.Botti@fresnosheriff.org</a></p>

<p>Please keep it professional and respectful... we aren&#39;t looking to bully anyone but we want them to take an official stance and provide the public with a well documented narrative for their decision.  It takes 3mins... call him/email him.</p>

<p>EDIT5: Local reporter that Lang reached out to, Corin Hoggard, now reporting that there were no stab wounds in the back and that it was misinformation from the beginning...  <a href="http://imgur.com/3VmQfVN">http://imgur.com/3VmQfVN</a></p>

<p>EDIT6:  Just got off the phone with Tony Botti.  Official stance is as follows:  3 superficial stab wounds to chest, nonfatal.  There never were wounds to the back... Cause of death: smoke inhalation and soot.  High levels of Carbon Monoxide found in his system.  Fresno PD to hold press conference today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this fucking real life? I mean the guy was obviously a little on the crazy side, but he provided <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCTMl9Ncxd-jhZ81s4z3XA6w">video proof</a> of the police surveilling his house multiple times. The manner in which he died was very gruesome and he was obviously murdered... And he predicted all of it. How the fuck did they rule his death a suicide? This makes me sick and this needs to be on the front page.</p>

<p>Edit 1: this guy Corin Hoggard&#39;s statement on social media sounds like a load of bullshit. He is claiming Lang was never stabbed in the back and that he watched the interview tape by a police officer as proof of this. It just doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>Lol, the FBI.  If anything they probably played some part in all this.  They don&#39;t police the police.  It&#39;s a corruption free-for-all bonanza.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. This is so true. My uncle has been in the state pen for over 15 years, for clicking one FBI link.... They even searched his comp, he never did/looked at even of this before or even thought of it, until the FBI was pushing it into his face like how they turn non radical muslims into radicals to bust them.... So fucking corrupt, they ruined his life and many others who wouldnt even dare get involved in that sick shit. But one of the FBI people were messaging in somehow, and got him to click on the link and convinced him to do it, no bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>Yep that pretty much mirrors what happened to my Unc.... Its sickening, I bet the FBI gets off from it. Theres no way they can distribute without ever looking at it once, every time they send the link they see a little of it, theres no other way. And how the FBI got the vid, I dont even wanna know. But they are ruining innocent lives. They should be going after the people who make the vids, the ones who distribute them, the ones who are apart of the CP rings.... Not innocent people that they trick into doing something they didnt even wanna do. 
And honestly I dont know what all happened, I was 12-13 maybe 14 at the time. I didnt understand alot of it, I thought he got popped for drugs. I finally found out the truth from my Ma... But again, didnt give me alot of details. Just that his comp was clean, he never left the house, just sat in his rooms doing blow and playing dreamcast... He used to be a very hardworker, made the best damn pizza I have ever tasted. All I know is somehow a FBI man found him online or something along the sorts... and messaged him (Either Email or IrC.) Got to be &quot;friends with him&quot;, and talked about this and that. Then the FBI man (or men) convinced him to look at CP... He wouldve never done it otherwise. He got 15+ years in the fed pen upstate.... Just for the FBI betraying him, and convincing him to click the link. As soon as he clicked it they tracked his IP and raided his house... He lived at my Gma, and took care of her because Gpa passed away from Lou Gherics disease, a horrible disease that I would not wish upon my worse enemy.... He was in a bad place, turned to harsher drugs from it... and the FBI exploited his situation.... And got him arrested for something he wouldve never done otherwise. I really want to bring attention to the media/citizens of America of how corrupt and devilish the FbI is.... 15 years?? In the fed pen?? For the FBI exploiting his depression?? Fuck them, I will never let go of this grudge they placed upon me.... I will make their corruption known, just not sure how yet...</p>

<p>With our common law courts back, holding police, mayors, corporations and CEOs accountable to law will be a very easy matter.  I encourage people to learn more, spread the word and participate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As John Lang&#39;s death is &#39;a bunch of empty conspiracy theory&#39;, and &#39;the Constitution is just a piece of paper&#39;.</p>

<p>The nice thing about calling something nonsense is that it enables people to dismiss it without actually thinking or learning about it, perpetuating the cycle.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they could <a href="http://nationallibertyalliance.org/civicscourse">learn the law</a> and find that it is the law as We&#39;d built it - not what&#39;s currently in practice.  As Mr. Lang discovered firsthand.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...at the Revolution, the sovereignty devolved on the people; and they are truly the sovereigns of the country, but they are sovereigns without subjects...with none to govern but themselves; the citizens of America are equal as fellow citizens, and as joint tenants in the sovereignty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discouraging people from learning the law isn&#39;t exactly a viable position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine it will garner a more radioactive approach. No one on the &quot;Blue&quot; side of things wants to put their own livelihood on the line to expose anything. I assume because if they&#39;re wrong they&#39;ll be ostracized for doing &quot;their job&quot;. So rather than finding out what happened they&#39;d rather listen to what they are told and not go beyond the surface to look for any truth.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get how anyone could come to this conclusion logically. I&#39;m waiting for the article where they expose their &quot;suspicion&quot; that he was mentally unstable and did this to himself just to &quot;spark outrage&quot;.</p>

<p>I think on some level &quot;they&quot; want this to be public enough so that the dissenters that feel the need to act, now have a more realistic reality to look at. It ties into this other article I read about how people obviously act different when they are reminded everything they&#39;re doing digitally is being tracked and recorded an compiled. This to me is the same concept, show someone who publicly raised suspicions and felt persecuted for it. Culminating in his death is the ultimate cautionary tale to the rest of &quot;us&quot;(dissenters).</p>

<p>&quot;Please stick your neck out investigate, but understand there is nothing you can do to stop &#39;us&#39; if we come for you&quot;</p>

<p>but I digress, this is a tragedy of unforeseen consequences in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple genuine questions, just reading this all for the first time, couple things jumped out at me that strike me as off and wondering if there is an explanation.  </p>

<p>First why did he name his neighbor and a coworker as also being part of the people with the police that would kill him?</p>

<p>Also is there any proof other than him saying that the charges against him concerning child pornography are trumped up?</p>

<p>Only reason I ask, is charges of child pornography are a big frickin&#39; deal and people have committed suicide for way less. Also not very smart to plan out framing a suicide and then stab them in the back, but if you say knew you were going down for something as heinous as child pornography and decided to commit suicide would it be all that surprising to try to frame those people you have beef with and try to take them down too?  </p>

<p>Idk just an idea cause something about adding the guy from work and his neighbor just struck me as odd unless there is something else I missed that would explain why they were named?</p>

<p>That is sort of my point though. This doesn&#39;t seem to  contribute to anything. This story popped up a couple months ago, and after a brief surge of curiosity, it died. 
No protests, little participation in any petitions, and no national coverage.
Now the official story is that after begging for help from anyone who would listen, Lang stabbed himself in the back and set his house on fire. 
What&#39;s next? Nothing.</p>
