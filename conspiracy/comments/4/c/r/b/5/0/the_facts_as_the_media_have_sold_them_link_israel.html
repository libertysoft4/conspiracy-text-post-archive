<p>Then the Brussels false flag hits...</p>

<p>On the same day the EU was scheduled to discuss Palestinian statehood</p>

<p>BTW, Jean Claude van damme is from Brussels....</p>

<p>Interestingly, Israel had warned Brussels of lax airport security</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-23/">http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-23/</a></p>

<p>Which is &#39;curious&#39; since , YET AGAIN, an Israeli company runs the Brussels airport security....</p>

<p>And you call the attacks a false flag because ...?</p>

<p>Brussels is known to be a hotbed of radical Islamist terrorists and arrests were made in the months and days before the attacks:</p>

</ul>

<p>And ISIS <a href="https://amaqagency.wordpress.com/2016/03/22/bombings-carried-out-by-islamic-state-fighters-hit-belgiums-capital-brussels/">took credit for the attacks right away through their own news agency.</a></p>

<p>Those silly Belgian police! Just because the perpetrators were seen on camera and ISIS took credit for it and incriminating materials were found in their houses, they think ISIS was responsible! How ridiculous! Don&#39;t they know that there were Jews nearby?</p>

<p>Except, even there, you&#39;re not right. The attacks took place in the public part of the airport, before passengers pass through security. ICTS Belgium does have contracts for security services for at least two airlines (<a href="http://www.ictseurope.com/media/news-pr/air-transat-nominates-icts-belgium-at-brussels-airport">Air Transat</a> and <a href="http://www.ictseurope.com/media/news-pr/jetairfly-awards-its-security-contract-to-icts-begium">Jetairfly</a>) in Brussels, but they&#39;re not responsible for security in the public part of the airport. And, <em>surprise</em>, ICTS Belgium is part of ICTS Europe, which is a <em>German</em>-owned and managed company. ICTS was sold off from the Israeli company in 2002 and they&#39;ve been competitors since 2005:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you enjoy laughing. Good for you.</p>

<p>I have a few questions for you....</p>

<p>If ISIS was indeed a real organic voice of a movement and not a western Intel creation used for the ends of the pursuits of globalist intentions, as you appear to believe based on the links you provided about the threats of terrorism, then...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Given that they are apparently smart and coordinated enough to successfully execute a coordinated attack on the metro and airport of one of the most secure cities in the world, housing the HQs of both NATO and the EU, with a clean getaway, on 322, Skull and Bones calling card, with one of their devices going off at 911 local time, we are talking about a highly sophisticated operation. One with immense planning, communication, and logistical capacity.And one with a eye towards symbolism, given the date and the timing mentioned above. Why then would such a well planned operation seemingly interrupt and stymie what would have likely been a considerable advancement in the EU meeting regarding Palestine?</p></li>
<li><p>Given all of the above again, why has ISIS never, to my knowledge, attached their cause to the plight of their Palestinian brethren, and shone the light on those inflicting  that ongoing genocide?</p></li>
<li><p>Why hasn&#39;t ISIS, if given the above, attacked the symbols of that which most offends their so called beliefs and mission- the usury system of Federal Reserve Banking globally, and the materialism and godlessness that that facilitates? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am curious as to why the most dangerous threat to peace and safety has not been able to even mention Palestine, Israel, or the central bank I g system, much less &#39;attack&#39; it, given that they are supposedly talented,funded, and sophisticated enough to pull of successful events in Brussels, Paris, etc... highly surveilled and secured locales?</p>

<p>The reasons are painful obvious to all but the most brainwashed or paid IMHO.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t know suicide bombing was a clean getaway. But, here again, you can see the infinite possibilities for finding &quot;coincidences&quot;. Now you&#39;re bring in a completely different group, Skull and Bones, and linking it to March 22, even though that&#39;s 22/03 in Europe, and most sources say that the metro bomb went off at 9:10, but you could pick 9:11 or 9:12 or 9:09 if those fit what you want to prove. Which is what? What evidence do you have that they picked the date and time for symbolic reasons? Is somebody trying to send a message to Skull and Bones that they&#39;re coming after them next? Or that they want to be friends with Skull and Bones? Or did Skull and Bones want to send a shout-out to the Illuminati? Could you tell me who was trying to accomplish what by having the attacks on March 22?</p>

<p>And what about all the other terrorist attacks over the past, say, 15 years? Do you know what the symbolic dates and times for those was? Or, if they don&#39;t fit,  you&#39;ll just ignore them but marvel at how amazing it is that this one does fit whatever scheme you can make it fit?</p>

<p>The Palestinian foreign minister met with the committee <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?sitelang=en&amp;amp;ref=I118379">the next day</a>, so it probably wasn&#39;t that big a deal that the March 22 meeting was skipped. Also on the <a href="http://parltrack.euwiki.org/committee/AFET">committee&#39;s agenda</a> for March 22 was Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam, Grand Mufti of Egypt, and discussions about Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, and Tunisia. But since those don&#39;t fit your preconceptions of what the attacks were about, you&#39;ll ignore the fact that those were disrupted, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given all of the above again, why has ISIS never, to my knowledge, attached their cause to the plight of their Palestinian brethren, and shone the light on those inflicting that ongoing genocide?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, of course they have. For example, in Issue 2 of their English-language magazine, <em>Dabiq</em>, they  say: &quot;As for the massacres taking place in Gaza against the Muslim men, women, and children, then the Islamic State will do everything within its means to continue striking down every apostate who stands as an obstacle on its path towards Palestine. It is not the manner of the Islamic State to throw empty, dry, and hypocritical words of condemnation and condolences like the Arab tawāghīt do in the UN and Arab League. Rather, its actions speak louder than its words and it is only a matter of time and patience before it reaches Palestine to fight the barbaric jews and kill those of them hiding behind the gharqad trees – the trees of the jews.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why hasn&#39;t ISIS, if given the above, attacked the symbols of that which most offends their so called beliefs and mission- the usury system of Federal Reserve Banking globally, and the materialism and godlessness that that facilitates?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think that&#39;s what most offends them. They do come out for a gold standard and against central banks in issues 5 and 6 of <em>Dabiq</em>, and in issue 8 they mention usury alongside fornication and gambling, and also, in the same issue, alongside incest and alcohol. So, yeah, they&#39;re against usury, but it doesn&#39;t seem that high a priority for them. Where did you get the idea that it was?</p>

<p>And your Skull and Bones questions are ridiculous. 322 is 322, even if written in a different convention in Europe, that number is a clear.link to that organisation.</p>

<p>Regarding other so called &#39;terrorist attacks&#39; yes, most have numerological significance. From 7/7 to 3/11 to 9/11 etc. If you are unaware of such connections, the internet, and likely even this sub can help you in researching these elements.</p>

<p>To say that meeting g being moved &quot;probably wasn&#39;t a big deal&quot; is not true. Not only is it very likely that certain participants were not in attendance, but also and obviously any press was muffled due to this &#39;bombing&#39;. I do not ignore this.</p>

<p>For your remaining comments, if you believe that IsIs is a real organization that has an English language magazine, then you will beLIEve a lot more than I, and most of us of the CT mindset.</p>

<p>Do you also believe terrorists carry fireproof passports to their events?</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely baffled by this. Did the Bakraoui brothers go to Yale? What interest would they have in linking Skull and Bones to the attack? Who decided that the attack would be on March 22 and for what purpose? Even if somebody from Skull and Bones were involved, it still doesn&#39;t make sense that they would want an attack on 3/22 or 22/3 or whatever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you are giving a <em>contradictory</em> explanation that the attacks were scheduled in order to disrupt a meeting. Well, unlike the Skull and Bones theory, this would at least accomplish <em>something</em>. But you still don&#39;t have <em>any</em> evidence that even suggests that was a motive. Do you really think that Khalid El Bakraoui woke up and said &quot;I think I&#39;ll blow myself up just so I can delay by one day the meeting of Riad Al-Malki with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament. That&#39;ll be worth it!&quot;</p>

<p>of course they did.  even if they had nothing to do with it, they would still claim responsibility.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah settle down Chaim.</p>

<p>First of all you are trying to block the truth that Israel wasn&#39;t behind 911, or Isis, or the numerous false flag terrorism going on in the world. You won&#39;t even care to research it because your hubris is too heavy. </p>

<p>In naval warfare, a “false flag” refers to an attack where a vessel flies a flag other than their true battle flag before engaging their enemy. It is a trick, designed to deceive the enemy about the true nature and origin of an attack.</p>

<p>In the democratic era, where governments require at least a plausible pretext before sending their nation to war, it has been adapted as a psychological warfare tactic to deceive a government’s own population into believing that an enemy nation has attacked them..</p>

<p>In 1954 the Israelis hired a number of Egyptian Jews to plant bombs in American and British cinemas, libraries, and other civilian targets to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood or other malcontents. The plan, known as the Lavon Affair, was part of an effort to convince the British to retain their military presence in the occupied Suez Canal zone. Several bombings took place, but the British were ultimately forced out after Nasser nationalized the canal in 1956.</p>

<p>In August 1964 the USS Maddox, a US destroyer on patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin, believed it had come under attack from North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats, engaging in evasive action and returning fire. The incident led to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing President Johnson to begin open warfare in Vietnam. It was later admitted that no attack had occurred, and in 2005 it was revealed that the NSA had manipulated their information to make it look like an attack had taken place.</p>

<p>In June 1967 the Israelis attacked the USS Liberty, a US Navy technical research ship, off the coast of Egypt. The ship was strafed relentlessly for hours in an apparent attempt to blame the attack on Egypt and draw the Americans into the Six Day War, but amazingly the crew managed to keep it afloat. In 2007 newly released NSA intercepts confirmed that the Israelis knew they were attacking an American ship, not an Egyptian ship as their cover story has maintained.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1999, a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities, killing 293 people and causing widespread panic. Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War, FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month. The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year.</p>

<p>In 2001, attacks in New York and Washington are blamed on Al Qaeda as a pretext for invading Afghanistan. The attack had numerous Mossad agents who came to secure the success of the event including Israeli university students and truck bombs placed around NYC and the infamous 5 Dancing Israelis who were arrested that day. In the months leading up to the event, American negotiators had warned Afghanistan’s Taliban that they were interested in securing right of way for proposed pipeline projects, and the US would achieve this with either a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs. The Bush administration’s first major national security directive, NSPD-9, a full-scale battle plan for the invasion of Afghanistan, including command and control, air and ground forces, and logistics, was drafted and sitting on the President’s desk to be signed off on September 4, 2001, seven days before the 9/11 attacks. The invasion proceeded as planned in October.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the hundreds of such incidents that have been staged over the centuries to blame political enemies for attacks that they did not commit. The tactic remains in common use today, and will continue to be employed as long as populations still blindly believe whatever their governments tell them about the origins of spectacular terror incidents.</p>

<p>Do you even know your religion is hijacked by Rothschilds? You guys were peaceful and got along with Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem before the Rothschilds decided they need a new nation to hold their wealth.</p>

<p>Do you even know the difference between Zionists and Jews? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychologists will tell you that even perfectly sane people have the ability to accept wild conspiracy theories. The more powerless or alone we feel, the more likely you will embrace such theories.
It&#39;s all linked to self-esteem. If you&#39;re the sort of person who feels isolated or disenfranchised, you&#39;re much more likely to develop wild theories as a way of making you seem more knowledgeable, more powerful, more special.
That might help explain why many Americans are into conspiracies. The irony of our technologically over-connected age is that there are scores of socially disconnected people sitting in dark rooms extrapolating all sorts of crap from factoids they find online.
As for blaming Israel for the attack, amid the weird strain of anti-Semitism that seems to run through the conspiracy community there is simultaneously a sort of belief that the Israeli military is full of superhuman Terminator soldiers who can do anything a U.S. soldier can do, but even more ruthlessly and efficiently. Plus: Krav maga. 
The burden of proof is on you motherfucker. Is the extent of your genius enables you to cobble together cherry picked claims from sites who support your wackiness, and now what? What are you going to do about it? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?! Are you just going to sit on your fat lazy ass, devouring the secret truths of the world or are you going to act on your information. Meet with a CIA recruiter and show him your stack of absolutely irrefutable evidence. They&#39;d be fools not to hire someone who learned so well from the internet. False flags, set-ups, diversions. You&#39;re no critical thinker. You go by what you read on the internet, unless it&#39;s not consistent with your fantasy world already. Many presidents before Bush found easy ways to get the United states into wars without slaughtering 1000&#39;s of their own citizenry. There is a reason nobody with any credibility or esteem takes your shit seriously, and it&#39;s not because Israelis forced millions of journalists, scientists, and other investigators to pretend they didn&#39;t see the &quot;real truth&quot; like you do. You must hold a lot of PHDs to be so knowledgeable.  </p>

<p>You said that country has ever come close to blaming Israel for 9/11. </p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>Canada last year had a parliament legislation to look into the truth behind 9/11. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX2dWCN1zhc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX2dWCN1zhc</a></p>

<p>Italian President Francisco Cossiga knows that 911 was done by Israel. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.alalam.ir/news/1804418">http://en.alalam.ir/news/1804418</a></p>

<p>Same as France when they recognized Palestinine they were hit with &quot;terrorists attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>Get your head out of your ass. It&#39;s not gonna stop Israel from killing people, but at least you won&#39;t be retarded anymore.</p>

<p>Have you ever read the Letters of Dodd: Too Many Jews in Nuremberg? </p>

<p>Do you know what the 3 Allies have in common?</p>

<p>I could teach you everything, if only you are willing to learn. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m afraid the information might kill you. Knowing that your identity is a lie.</p>
