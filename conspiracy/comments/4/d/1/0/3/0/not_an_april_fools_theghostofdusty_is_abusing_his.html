<p>I have no love lost for <del>flytape</del><sup>theghostofdusty</sup> after the whole <del>podcast thing,</del><sup>stalk<sup>people<sup>to<sup>other<sup>sites<sup>shit.</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>  This should be x posted at <del>r/whogivesashit</del><sup>r/ihaveagaystalker.</sup></p>

<p>Not because of the way it will possibly effect you, but because he isn&#39;t worth the attention, or time. If that happens, <del>move on.</del> Put him on blast like you are doing.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give him that power you are giving him. Or the impression that he has any. Because it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>I can see the slug trails from here in his pants already if you are correct. Do you want to be the source of his orgasmic bliss? Let him jack himself off <del>with an alt.</del></p>

<p><del>Definitely don&#39;t subject yourself to the same</del> Do you know the amount of under the table work he had to do to get his mod spot? </p>

<p>If you do, then you also understand he had two choices, to spit, or swallow.  Hence the reason why he has cyber short man&#39;s syndrome.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t respect a person like that, at least I cant.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give anyone at reddit or anywhere for that matter that power over you. It&#39;s reddit. A bunch of cyber nobody&#39;s.</p>

<p>The only reason they pull shit like that here is because of short comings IRL. And if they tried it IRL, they would probably get a hot one to the eye. Or at the least going home with a hair line fracture.</p>

<p>Douche&#39;s that big aren&#39;t born, they are made. Don&#39;t let them <del>make</del><sup>effect</sup>  you.</p>

<p>The day I start worrying about votes, some one banning me here, or caring about what someone says about me here for that matter, is the day I become an ex-redditor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If SovereignMan is trustworthy then why is he removing threads &amp; comments about yesterday&#39;s fiasco?</p>

<p>For that matter, where are all the other mods?</p>

<p>Ambiguously_Ironic presented a display of apparent integrity in yesterday&#39;s fiasco thread.  But now that it was revealed to have been a psyop, where&#39;s Ambiguously_Ironic?  Was that &quot;April Fool&#39;s&quot; integrity?</p>

<p>I put smokinbluebear &amp; Orangutan into the &quot;trustworthy&quot; category normally.</p>

<p>But ALL of the mods have, by their silence, become complicit in a de-facto operation to strengthen the fake power-abuser accounts of Flytape &amp; Dusty.</p>

<p>Even if there were any innocent moderators, their silence has made them complicit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Top mod is basically a reddit placeholder.  IIRC he used to mod a lot more but the modding-100+ subs thing has fallen off a little bit as there was some controversy about it a while back.  He is no longer top mod of some of the huge subs hes used to &#39;mod&#39;.</p>

<p>The old second mod demodded all the other lower mods some years ago when things were seeming real shady, and illuminatedwax appeared after another 6 month hiatus to restore the mods within like a day...and to remove the offending mod.</p>

<p>So there isn&#39;t really any way to &#39;get shit together&#39;, as the only people who will ever be allowed to mod are already in on whatever it is thats fucking this place up (assuming there is some entity/organization attempting to direct conversation here) or are useful idiots.</p>

<p>Or maybe there isn&#39;t anything nefarious going on and the mods just like flytape so much that they don&#39;t care about the nonstop yearslong history of complaints about his shitty modding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take issue with the group of people who are always attacking the mod team without any real evidence. Mostly because I end up dedicating a portion of my time investigating these matters only to find that the OP is usually responsible for their content being removed.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in this sub for a long while and these are the typical answers :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>OP is an asshole and breaking rules/ Takes moderation actions as a personal attack without acknowledging their initial offense</p></li>
<li><p>OP is trolling the sub in order to pander to the crowd</p></li>
<li><p>OP is intentionally attacking a mod in order to create a &quot;power vacuum&quot; in the mod team</p></li>

<p>That was one of the biggest complaints as I recall though,  that no collaboration or even any notice was given to anyone before it was done.

<p>Was it a power trip or was it a majority of users attacking a mod for something they found offensive? Maybe, there was an over reaction by the community that resulted in a cult of individuals dedicated to attacking that mod?</p>

<p>Nope.  It was never sanctioned by the mod team and subsequently removed by the higher ups when they logged in. (edit: just ask <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The podcast hosts began abusing their mod powers by silencing and banning users, which led to their removal/suspension of moderating duties. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the true story.  </p>

<p>Have a great day!</p>

<p>But like in every drama circle jerk there&#39;s assholes who bait mods into action and take snapshots of their handy work. Then they post their bullshit as evidence of mod corruption.</p>

<p>Then they create self posts where the lot of them manufacture consent and post their prized snapshots. Then they furiously masturbate over their &quot;successful&quot; posts.</p>

<p>And of course, those of us who aren&#39;t sheep just stand around and wait for the kids to disperse so shit can get back to normal.</p>

<p>I think you need to go back and revisit that thread and the reasons why people got banned.  If they were legitimate bans,  then why was FT removed from his mod position?  Please,  I think you might want to go back and review the thread.  There was no reasons for the bans, none. </p>

<p>Rule 10: <em>Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban.</em></p>

<p>Lol are you seriously defending a pathetic rule like this?  Do you really want to make this a &#39;safe space&#39; cliche considering how ironic that would be?  This is a controversial subreddit in nature, dealing with conspiracies.  That rule could silence legitimate criticisms -- and that&#39;s what they did.</p>

<p>This is the internet.  This is reddit.  This forum discusses conspiracies.  The opinions shared here are highly controversial.  Defending rule 10 is hypocritical and goes against the spirit of the 1st amendment. </p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>totally</em> used to silence dissent.</p>

<p>Have a great Sunday.</p>

<p>His story is that his brother was interested in conspiracy theories and government corruption and that is what influenced him to volunteer to mod here. He made <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">/r/conspiratocracy</a> (since taken over and vandalized by the conspiratard goons) and tried to bring the communities together. He modded me and Flytape and Canadian_POG and someone else I can&#39;t recall right now. After I was modded the hate-focued users there freaked right out and started screaming bloody murder so he de-modded me. </p>

<p>Basically he wasn&#39;t especially concerned with this sub, more interested in meta-drama and playing diplomat.</p>
