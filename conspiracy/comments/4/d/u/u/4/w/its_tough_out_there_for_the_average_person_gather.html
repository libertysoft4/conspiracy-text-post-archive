        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Intro</strong></p>

<p>My father hates conspiracy theories. On the rare occasion they come up, he just leaves the room. So it was interesting to hear him (a man with 30+ years experience on Wall Street) grumpily complain today that &quot;4 central bankers run this whole damn country.&quot;  </p>

<p>This statement got me thinking about how we&#39;re entering a new era of American history. Welcome to <strong>Technocracy</strong>, ladies and gentlemen. The middle-class jobs aren&#39;t coming back, everything&#39;s going high tech/high skill, and you better believe the government&#39;s going to use every trick in the book to maintain order as money concentrates in the .1% Also, androgyny is &quot;in&quot; and masculinity is &quot;out&quot; - get with the program!</p>

<p>Now, astute observers have known this age was coming for decades. Carter&#39;s National Security Advisor, Obama&#39;s personal mentor, and all-around &quot;elite&quot; Zbigniew Brzezinski had this to say in his aptly titled book <em>Between Two Ages</em> (1970): </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[A major threat to America is] the gradual appearance of a more controlled and directed society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite whose claim to political power would rest on allegedly superior scientific know-how. Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society under close surveillance and control. (1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Brzezinski can&#39;t admit to helping usher in this new age in a book that&#39;s read in college classrooms.  However, in documents not meant for public eyes, officials can be a little more frank. From the massive <em>Behavior Science Teacher Education Program</em> in 1968, we learn: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A small elite will carry society&#39;s burdens. The resulting impersonal manipulation of most people&#39;s life styles will be softened by provisions for pleasure seeking and guaranteed physical necessities. Participatory democracy in the American-ideal mold will mainly disappear. The worth and dignity of individuals will be endangered on every hand. Only exceptional individuals will be able to maintain a sense of worth and dignity. (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This report was circulated to every state education department in the country, and is the basis for much of our modern day school system. John Taylor Gatto (3-time New York City teacher of the year) talks about it extensively in his books. </p>

<p>These predictions (errr...plans) have come to fruition, with 90% of wealth now being concentrated in the top 1%. (3) That&#39;s some third-world Banana Republic shit. </p>

<p>Any ways, no conspiracy here - outsourcing factories to China, technology eliminating entire industries, nonstop immigration, and an economy that is 70% based on consumption (this is the Fed&#39;s own number) (4) tends to fuck the middle and lower classes over.   </p>

<p><strong>More About Knowledge...</strong> </p>

<p>There is a system of behavioral psychology/scientific management being used in the school system. This stuff is <em>designed</em> to create messed up people (especially men.) </p>

<p>For people just out of college: </p>

<p>-Ever wonder why 70% of your class graduated in debt? (5) </p>

<p>-Or why the op-eds in your school newspaper read like Marxist training manuals? </p>

<p>-Or why you have to meet in groups outside of class a lot more now (i.e. &quot;extracurriculars&quot;) in order to have a strong resume? </p>

<p>-Or why there will be 3 million more women in college than men (60-40 split) by 2024? (6) </p>

<p>-Or why college administrations side with ridiculous false rape accusations and actually allow &#39;safe spaces?&#39; </p>

<p>-Or why almost 20% of high school boys have been diagnosed with ADHD (twice the rate of women)? </p>

<p>-Or why there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201402/the-college-student-mental-health-crisis">mental health epidemic</a> on college campuses? </p>

<p>Its been decided that most of us are going to live in a socialist-type society, with a knowledge elite presiding over us. Therefore, men&#39;s aggressive instincts must be eliminated, dependency on the system must be enforced, and colleges will be used to &quot;level the playing field.&quot; </p>

<p>Again, no conspiracy here, and there are <em>some</em> logical reasons to bring this in, but we should all know it&#39;s happening. Going back to BSTEP, we read: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interpersonal relations and pleasure-cultural development -- and other attitudes and skills compatible with a non-work world [will replace traditional education.] (9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Partying in college is not &quot;rebellious.&quot; They want students to be somewhat hedonistic. Its been deemed preferable to the previously &quot;Patriarchal&quot; colleges that young men of means meant to to network and study serious topics. </p>

<p>So the school system is quite literally going &quot;anti-male&quot; in order to bring about a society that is supposedly more &quot;humane&quot; and &quot;equitable.&quot; They also claim men need to be restrained to prevent another catastrophic war, to usher in an age based on &quot;consensus&quot; and &quot;dialogue&quot; as the world globalizes, etc. </p>

<p>What they&#39;re doing to make this a reality is using Kurt Lewin&#39;s <strong>force field analysis</strong> amongst other tactics to just destroy our minds and then rebuild them with their preferred worldview. </p>

<p>Indeed, if your goal is to spread the &quot;Blue Pill&quot; what you need to do is capitalize on people&#39;s resentment towards the Father. Growing up, the Father necessarily moderates the child&#39;s carnal desires (&quot;no desert until you finish your vegetables.&quot; ) This is <strong>good</strong> - the Father both metaphorically and in practice represents right-wrong/objective truth.</p>

<p>Humans, however, often become fixated on dopamine rushes and therefore start to resent the Father for preventing access to sources of &quot;dope&quot; in the environment (&quot;If I catch you doing X, Y, or Z you&#39;re grounded&quot; etc.) Pleasurable sensations can come from a range of activities, so we’re not just talking about drugs and sex here. </p>

<p>The state then exploits this tension to step in and replace the Father as the authority in the child&#39;s life. This is first done through the school system and colleges (based on the Prussian model), which separate kids from the family and uses <strong>force-field dynamics</strong> (or group psychology) to change kids&#39; values. <strong>Kurt Lewin</strong> headed the &quot;Group Dynamics&quot; department at MIT and founded the first <strong>National Training Laboratory</strong> in 1947. This groups <a href="http://www.ntl.org/">website</a> says on the homepage: &quot;Our mission is to advance Applied Behavioral Science (ABS) in the service of social justice, oppression-free societies...&quot; In other words, they create social-justice warriors. There are 10 or 15 of these labs now in the United States, with the <a href="https://www.mcrel.org/">Mid-Continent Regional Education Laboratory</a> being another biggy. </p>

<p>Any ways, what Lewin discovered is something we all intuitively know: people are much more impressionable in group settings. If <strong>The Group</strong> appears to hold a certain belief, then individuals will adopt that belief in order to fit in. So if you want to change people&#39;s beliefs, what you should do is get them in groups that are led by trained facilitators who can lead the group discussion toward a predetermined outcome. This has the added benefit of making the consensus seem organic.  Check out <em>The Change Agent’s Guide to Education</em> (1976) if you want to learn more.  </p>

<p>What you also want to do is promote as much dopamine liberation as possible. So casual sex, liberal attitudes on drugs, party culture, etc. are all encouraged. Again, this has the effect of turning people&#39;s gaze AWAY from the Father (who is the voice of restraint, right/wrong, etc.) and towards moral relativism. Benjamin Bloom, who literally wrote the book on modern education (called <em>Taxonomy of Educational Objectives</em>), had this to say in Book 1: “We recognize the point of view that truth and knowledge are only relative and that there are no hard and fast truths which exist for all time and places.&quot; </p>

<p>Group settings, dopamine liberation, moral relativism, separation from Father figures...sounds pretty similar to an American college, doesn&#39;t it? American colleges are actually based on the <strong>Soviet model.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Blue-pill&quot; environments cause cognitive dissonance because they go against our natural wiring. Social scientists purposefully construct them this way (they call it a &quot;force field.&quot;) Lewin writes, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Change in organization can be derived from the overlapping between play [dopamine emancipation/fun with peer group/liberalism] and barrier [the Father&#39;s influence] behavior. To be governed by two strong goals is equivalent to the existence of two conflicting controlling heads within the organism. This should lead to a decrease in degree of hierarchical organization. Also, a certain disorganization should result from the fact that the cognitive-motor system loses to some degree its character of a good medium because of these conflicting heads.  It ceases to be in a state of near equilibrium...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So kids&#39; natural orientation is overridden in Blue Pill environments and their brains are literally scrambled. Lewin refers to this practice as <strong>“unfreezing”</strong> values and beliefs. The goal is to then implement <strong>“change”</strong> (i.e. download your preferred values) and then permanently <strong>“freeze”</strong> them into place. </p>

<p>The tension between these two conflicting world views (Natural Law vs. Blue Pill) is too much for most people to overcome. Bloom writes, &quot;[Reconciliation] is too challenging a goal for the individual to achieve on his own, and the net effect is either maladjustment or the embracing of a philosophy of life developed by others.&quot;</p>

<p>To any one struggling out there: I hope this clears up some confusion, and just keep grinding. </p>

<p>All of the troubles in or world are caused by some super powerful assholes. They are super powerful because of dollars. Banks print the dollars, but consumers give them value. Without consumers, they will be much less accumulation of dollars and power.</p>

<p>In short the idea is that a general boycott will cause the global economy to actually collapse. Probably a really shitty period of time, but humans will rebuild like a phoenix from the ashes. We must pull the bandaid off and let the wound heal.</p>

<p>Imagine occupy wallstreet plus the tea party, but this time the media can&#39;t spin away a truly broken eCONomy. </p>

<p>As you said, the people want a plan. IMHO the plan should be individual work towards improving your life via means OTHER than dollars. Install a garden this spring and you can kick Monsanto in the face every harvest.</p>

<p>Heck, even cancelling Netflix would be a huge step in the right direction...</p>

<p>tl-dr: general boycott = buy food and shelter, but no more entertainment. Focus all dollars on removing future reliance from dollars.</p>

<p>Most of this is obvious, even if only at an intuitive level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t.  Not even intuitively.  To you, and perhaps a sphere of influence around you ... sure, it might even be more than obvious and feel like &quot;common knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>But for the average, everyday person who seems to &quot;run on autopilot&quot; going to a job they hate, who can&#39;t wait until their two weeks of &quot;paid vacation&quot; they feel guilty about taking ... who comes home every day too tired to even think about their lives...</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not intuitive.</p>

<p>This person buys lottery tickets and returns Publisher&#39;s Clearing House entries hoping for the &quot;big win,&quot; their own &quot;check in the mail&quot; like it shows on TV.</p>

<p>Then, they go back to their job the next day and...</p>

<p>The next day that person gets fired, and has to find another job while the bills stack up and in the case of a family ... mouths need to be fed etc...</p>

<p>That is an oversimplified example, of course.</p>

<p>In fact, this is likely the majority of the U.S. population right now.  They have access to the information, but even if they are fortunate enough to see this type of information for the first time ... they will wipe it out of their memory as &quot;conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>They really <strong>don&#39;t</strong> want this information, nor have &quot;time for it.&quot;  They just want a decent shot at a life where they don&#39;t have to stare a mortgage, bills, kids, a significant other  etc... in the face and admit to themselves that it IS tough ... and they can&#39;t do it.</p>

<p><strong>So, this information needs to be everywhere, so there are as many &quot;starting places&quot; for people who have never even thought the first thought about &quot;why&quot; it IS so tough.</strong></p>

<p>Because who you are calling &quot;intellectually functional&quot; are people who have  had an opportunity to slow down in our culture of &quot;speed up&quot; and learn.</p>

<p>That or they are gifted with a higher intellectual capacity and critical thinking skills.  That is NOT the majority.</p>

<p>So, no, it is not obvious, and far from it.</p>

<p>We need (a lot) more of THIS type of post, AND we need more &quot;plans, information and dissemination&quot; (as you put it) for those who are in a fortunate enough position to take action and DO something about it. </p>

<p>To some of the people who visit this thread or subreddit, but some are visiting for the very first time ... so the &quot;choir&quot; you speak of is a mixed bag most of the time.</p>

<p>Getting this stuff out to the mainstream and absorbed is part of the dissemination issue I&#39;m speaking of.
This is the kind of stuff that I should be seeing if I turn on Fox news or MSNBC. This is the stuff that should be taught in schools. These sort of party-neutral social political issues that threaten the health and longevity of our nation, if not the entire western way of life.</p>

<p>So, that leads to the next part of my question, is it WORTH fixing?</p>

<p>In principle, <strong>yes.</strong>  Within your or my own lifetime, it probably won&#39;t even come close to happening the way I (and I am sticking my neck out in assumption, you) want it to happen.  </p>

<p>Too many big rocks to move that have entrenched themselves into a woven spider web of deceit, lies, and human species domination.</p>

<p>I am going to attempt (at a weak level) to answer this with another question:</p>

<p>How do you eat an Elephant?</p>

<p>Answer?  One bite at a time.</p>

<p>If so, how is that accomplished in a way that we&#39;re not always playing from behind?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the toughest question.</p>

<p>The answer nobody wants to hear is <strong>180 million of us have to hit the elite right in their eyes, with several concentrated strikes.</strong></p>

<p>Not likely to happen, ever.  Because from my perspective, part of &quot;their game&quot; is being &quot;subtle&quot; so we won&#39;t rise up and do that.</p>

<p>And they are fucking good at that game.</p>

<p>How do you unwash their brains, recruit, and get them to accept these realizations about themselves and the world they wake up to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My perspective is not one you will like...</p>

<p>You can&#39;t.  You can&#39;t &quot;get&quot; anyone, or &quot;force&quot; anyone, or &quot;recruit&quot; anyone that isn&#39;t first ready to do that themselves.</p>

<p>Like in marketing, you can&#39;t &quot;force&quot; people to buy, you can only put a message in front of those who are ready to buy what you are selling (ready to buy in some degree, anyhow).</p>

<p>As much as I despise the man, Edward Bernays was a genius ... a master at doing this.  He knew exactly what buttons to push.  Others do it too, but in my opinion, none were as masterful as Bernays (S.O.B.).</p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s not hopeless, but in order for anyone who is fortunate enough to &quot;be awake&quot; or start awakening to have an effect on the masses ... they must eternally seek those who have the smallest of sparks inside them, and show them the rest of the light.</p>

<p>The reality (that I hate) is...</p>

<p>In the end, most of our species will never even see this crap coming ... so it&#39;s up to us to continue the fight in the attempt to <em>hopefully</em> allow future generations to loosen the noose that is so carefully placed around all of our necks.</p>

<p>Naturally, I hope that happens in my lifetime ... but reality says otherwise.  That doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t happen though ... so YES! it&#39;s worth it. :)</p>

<p>I would ask you, why do you think that is?  ;)  </p>

<p>But I would also caution against &quot;binary&quot; thinking like &quot;us versus them&quot; and that this is some sort of war with an opposition that we have to eliminate.  </p>

<p>That is how &quot;they&quot; would want you to think as well, and part of the reason &quot;they&quot; are in power, and most other people are not.  (Ponerology is a start here, to explain their behavior).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the opposition has no rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you boil it all down, neither do &quot;we.&quot; ;)  Paradoxically, we do set our own limitations both on an individual level and collectively.  That is where the idea of civility comes from.</p>

<p>When I mentioned the 180 million of us and concentrated strikes, I was referring to numbers of people ... not to a &quot;war like&quot; outcome.  </p>

<p>What &quot;is&quot; is ... and because of our biological make up, until evolutionary forces somehow remove the possibility of another &quot;elite&quot; grouping of us to want to dominate the rest of us, even if we could somehow arrest the behavior of the current &quot;elite&quot; ... I&#39;m afraid more will pop up in their place.</p>

<p>We are animals after all.</p>

<p>then going geurrilla seems the only option.</p>

<p>I hope not.  As horrible as these &quot;elite&quot; are (grouping them for simplicity sake) ... we are all part of one species on this planet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I guess the fundamental question is, can you do that and maintain the high ground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to try, when I mentioned &quot;swinging&quot; in my earlier comment, that is what I meant. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&#39;t have lifetimes to correct this.</p>

<p>That is your short human existence speaking to you, and limiting your frame of thought.  The planet, the cosmos, doesn&#39;t care.  In the <strong>really</strong> big picture, things will just keep going:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PN5JJDh78I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PN5JJDh78I</a>
(this puts the psychopaths in perspective, they are really doing this for nothing, they will in the end ... accomplish NOTHING by trying to dominate the Homo sapiens species)</p>

<p>What &quot;founding way of life&quot;?  What &quot;principles&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a strong contingent of people who actually believe this authoritarian dystopia is the best future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s indoctrination and social conditioning at its worst.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you talked to any children lately?</p>

<p>I have two of my own.  I try to relate to (and guide) them and their friends, because after I&#39;m gone ... the process of life continues in them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A good cautionary tale is somewhere in history, I&#39;d presume. It always is.</p>

<p>Lots of them, this isn&#39;t the only cycle within our hundreds of thousands of years as a species that a group of our species has tried to dominate the rest.</p>

<p><strong>And, it won&#39;t be the last</strong> ... until that urge to dominate is removed from our biology.</p>

<p>So nothing we do, nor lifetimes, really matter for the next few hundred thousand/million years until our humanity and urge to dominate is bleached out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the cosmic picture (which is a big place), in essence this is true.  Think about it, does some intelligent life form on another planet even know that you exist?</p>

<p>It will likely be a next, evolved version of our species that &quot;might&quot; not want to dominate other members of the species.</p>

<p>In terms of &quot;doesn&#39;t matter&quot; though ... <em>of course</em> it matters within the limited scope of time coming up, to some degree.  That&#39;s why I will personally keep swinging one little bit at a time.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking that should we &quot;succeed&quot; against &quot;these elites&quot; ... that it won&#39;t ever happen again.  This isn&#39;t a &quot;zero sum&quot; effort with a finite beginning and ending, even if the &quot;elites&quot; win and dominate (which of course, I hope they don&#39;t).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t get behind that sort of thinking.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a cause for you (or I) to &quot;get behind.&quot;  All you and I can do is keep eating the Elephant, one bite at a time.  Try to make the best of it, and also try to help the next generation make the best of it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal freedom ends where it infringes on anothers freedoms. But where you draw the line decided if you are some dystopian SJW hellscape or modestly free, but entirely safe hedonists. As for family values an intelligent person is mostly held back by them past a certain age, but I can see where they have some place for some people. Education is actually the best it has ever been, but its not taking place in every 4 year school and does exceptionally well on the internet. The corrosive elements I will agree with -  they need to go.</p>

<p>Strangely the society described by OP isn&#39;t that harmful for the individual if you are below upper middle class. (Depending on how it is implemented and what thresholds are considered acceptable)
Hell, if implemented well it would actually raise quality of living substantially.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the .1% hardly care about quality of living and will likely settle for SJW hellscape rather than brave new world. Much easier to police when the people police themselves.</p>

However I will address what I got from it and the third paragraph:
Not everyone can be held to be responsible to society, so laws are in place to guard against others infringing on your rights. As I had stated, where you draw the line determines if the resulting society is one you would enjoy living in or despise living in.</p>

<p>As for emotional intelligence, It is a component of intelligence in my view, so it was meant to set pretense not for people to use traditional intelligence as an excuse to act negatively, but to imply that some people can rise above their normal support structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I don&#39;t disagree with that either. I think masculinity is a focus of this post because that&#39;s what is essential for any type of successful uprising, which is what the elites, or anyone in history who has been in power for that matter, is always afraid of. By eliminating as much masculinity in men as they can, they&#39;re reducing this chance by driving us to complacency. One could also make a case that the rise of feminism is engineered to a degree to help create a society in which there are more independent beings and fewer couples. Just positing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what your saying. From my perspective, it simply doesn&#39;t matter if humanity survives or not; this is some kind of false reality I.e. the physical universe. I look at it from a spiritual perspective; the elite have downgraded the feminine for millennia, and in order to be true humans we need to return to our tribal, egalitarian societies. Now, as far as a fight goes; yes, they have diluted masculinity in human beings to a significant degree, but no where near enough in the United States because we still have firearms. Not to mention, most of the military and half the police will not willingly go along with any kind of serious martial law. The UN and foreign powers may very well take them from us because they have the numbers but that would take a lot of doing. You better believe if it comes to that, that every single species on this planet will face potential extinction, so let&#39;s see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re going to see the type of martial law often feared here in the U.S. employed in places like Europe before it comes into fruition here, that is true. It will be extremely difficult to disarm Americans, because most of us know the reason for the second amendment, and as you said, nobody would really be on board for executing gun confiscations unless they have a death wish. It would take a highly-motivated exterior force, not terribly unlike what the U.N. &quot;Peacekeeping Troops&quot; are becoming, who are mislead or brainwashed into finding our compliance an absolute necessity. Might this happen one day? Who really knows. Any attack on American citizens would have to start from the economic side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>jesus christ.  this is all about as biased as it gets.  dont get me wrong, i agree with some of what youre saying, but at least half of everything up there is complete bullshit.  im not going to debate this or add anything useful or even agree with specific parts, but the whole thing is filled with half truths and opinions along with actual sources.  and of course people on this sub eat it the fuck up. </p>

<p>if someone on here broke a real conspiracy most people on here would downvote it move on.</p>

<p>EDIT: all the same, nice work.  you laid out your argument very well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. It&#39;s not education, it&#39; entrainment. Teaching you &#39;what&#39; to think, not &#39;how&#39; to think. Common Core was designed as a destructive tool. And it&#39;s working.</p>

<p>You&#39;re paragraph on The Group is very important. And it applies to any group setting... including Social Media. It plays on peoples inherent desire to not be &#39;left out&#39;.</p>

<p>We are manipulated through culture; education, entertainment, religion. Knowing this does not make one immune from the affects if you expose yourself to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m leaning towards agreeing with your post. But there is this feeling that you came to these conclusions based on fear first then facts. What&#39;s wrong with androgyny?</p>

<p>Making social justice warriors that actually promote social justice isn&#39;t bad, this is a side effect of a culturally aware public. Though the public education system is almost entirely corrupt there are some good people in their, actually teaching, and there&#39;s also a lot of people really learning.</p>

<p>People throw out this &quot;social justice warrior&quot; just the same way sheep throw out the phase &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot; Neither term actually communicates what the person believes, just what others believe about this person. Let&#39;s step above insults and have a worthwhile discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good work, we are also coming from a generation that isnt under the thumb of media to gets its news from. We have the opportunity, atleast at the moment, to find out from different sides about news stories. I just wish there were places in the world where people could gather just to discuss. I feel more people would realize that more and more people are waking up but waking up is one part, getting up and putting action behind it, putting yourself behind it, well thats the other step. </p>
