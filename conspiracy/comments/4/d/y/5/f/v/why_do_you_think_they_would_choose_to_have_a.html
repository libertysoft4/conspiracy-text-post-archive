<p>Are you drunk? If they are easier to control, how are their parents too tied up to be politically active?</p>

<p>EDIT: I was going to just leave it at that, but you really are just talking out of your arse and don&#39;t know the first thing about autism. It is a spectrum disorder that ranges from the uncontrollable and uncommunicative to the <em>bona fide</em> genius. If you want to dumb down the population why would you give them something that is just as likely to make geniuses as dullards?</p>

<p>You twice said they are &quot;easier to control&quot;. You then said they become the centre of their carer&#39;s lives. If they are so easy to control, why do they need so much care? What happens when those autistic children grow into autistic adults? Do they suddenly not need a carer and miraculously become perfect docile sheep?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Zombie Principle.
The best way to dehumanize a group and/or population is to actually de-humanize them. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.calgaryautism.com/characteristics.htm">http://www.calgaryautism.com/characteristics.htm</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some highlights of the link.
Site&#39;s caveat states: &quot;No one will exhibit all of these characteristics, as each case of autism has its own unique gifts and struggles.  This is a list of commonly seen characteristics found on the autism spectrum.  This list is provided for educational purposes and not meant to be used for diagnosing autism.  Many of these characteristics can also be found in those struggling with ADD/ADHD.  Generally, an individual with autism will have struggles in several categories below, not just one&quot;</p>

<p>Social Skills:</p>

<ul>
<li> Gives spontaneous comments which seem to have no connection to the current conversation.</li>
<li> Unaware of/disinterested in what is going on around them.</li>
<li> Talks excessively about one or two topics (dinosaurs, movies, etc.).</li>
<li> Overly trusting or unable to read the motives behinds peoples’ actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Behaviors:</p>

<ul>
<li> Obsessions with objects, ideas or desires.</li>
<li> Ritualistic or compulsive behavior patterns</li>
<li> Difficulty transferring skills from one area to another.  (lacking in relational pattern recognition and memory, e.g. make poor conspiracy theorists)</li>
<li> Inability to perceive potentially dangerous situations. (ignorance is bliss)</li>
<li> Extreme fear (phobia) for no apparent reason. (paranoia is useful in useful when imprinting aka mind control)</li>
</ul>

<p>School related skills:</p>

<ul>
<li> Exceptionally high skills in some areas and very low in others.  (compartmentalized thinking, poor inter-disciplinary analysis of facts/events therefore poor in pattern recognition aka conspiracy theories)</li>
<li> Difficulty with reading comprehension (can quote an answer, but unable to predict, summarize or find symbolism)</li>
<li> Short attention span for most lessons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems to me there are many useful traits there for those in positions of power and control over societies&#39; institutions who have vested interest in maintaining the status quo.</p>

<p>Note I&#39;m just humoring OP&#39;s premise and no I do not believe that autism is part of a conspiracy partly due to the fact I&#39;ve not read any convincing evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;ve said elsewhere, I don&#39;t support this &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot; thing (autism is simply evolution in chaotic action), but I do aknowledge that the doctors administering the vaccines for solid scientific and ethical reasons do so without actually knowing what they are injecting into their patients. They have to trust the label on the bottle and the research done by people very likely funded by &#39;persons&#39; interested in making money by any means. </p>

<p>One of the endlessly interesting things about conspiracy theory is often what is <em>not</em> talked about. Again, I do not think vaccines cause autism, but let&#39;s just entertain that idea for a moment.</p>

<p>Autism is a spectrum disorder, and that spectrum is very wide. Some autistics are non-verbal and prone to violent outbursts that can be attributed to different perceptions of sensory input, like touch or hearing. Others can be described as completely normal people in almost every respect. Some autistics have low IQs, most are well within the normal range, and a few are gifted in some way. One autistic may be obssessed with the guitar but be a terrible player while another could play Beethovan by ear five minutes after hearing it the first time. Some autistics are functionally innumerate, while others become physics professors. Some are blind to body language, others are charismatic public speakers that probably mumble and can&#39;t make eye-contact in personal conversation. </p>

<p>There are a whole range of things on the autism spectrum, so why is it that all the talk is about one extreme and not the other? Some autistics are such a burden on their families they are put into permanent care. Others become successful because they are hyper-focussed on a narrow range of subjects and even with an average intelligence will have a better grasp of something simply because they have obssessively read every word ever published on it. Some are geniuses. Why would the government want to create a nation of droolers when we have numerous examples, in fact and fiction, of them trying to &#39;perfect&#39; humanity? </p>

<p>We know about eugenics. We know about the Nazi Master Race. We know about Project Paperclip. Why are people talking about a plan to create a nation of idiots instead of one to breed a nation of geniuses? The profoundly retarded autistic <em>costs</em> money while the gifted autistic <em>makes</em> money. Governments need geniuses to do things like break enemy codes, work out how to get a rocket to Mars, and come up with fun and exciting new ways to kill people. Why would they invest in idiots instead of geniuses?</p>
