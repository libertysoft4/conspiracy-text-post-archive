<p>Mark: &quot;Rein...forget it. Well, who do you think you might have been in the past?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry my friend but this, to be blunt, is mental diarrhea. You are espousing something that can&#39;t be understood either mathematically or verbally or in combination. There is virtue in trying to explain reality, usually we use a &quot;reductive&quot; form connecting one truth to another, your writing is &quot;expansive&quot; meaning too damn many of your connecting lines and whipsawing with tenuous connections between your disparate subjects. Nowhere do you connect to the title line and show in the least way how every conspiracy has a basis in a parallel world. Many agree that there can be infinite parallel worlds but I don&#39;t get how you think we can see across them, the boundaries. How about just posting one of these paragraphs in r/science and see what responses you get. I think they will reject this gobble as fevered imaginings. You need to winnow this down and convince us of at least one of these connections</p>

When you feel better, it&#39;s ok to think about peering into other dimensions. Some of the worlds most important thinkers probably had autism to some degree. It&#39;s a matter of getting those mental connections working on something together within some kind of framework. Goals are good. Make the goal of getting rid of Lyme disease you singular focus.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever put together a puzzle? Just talk less around her. Nurturing people hear and try to fix things. If you keep delivering too many things for her to try to fix, she will suffer. Ask her to help you get your blood test and be quiet around her, this is certainly something she can do and she will feel better because it is something she can fix.

<p>But since you want to carry on the convo let me ask:  At what point are you certain?   Do you have memories that you can share that can be verified?  Do you see visions?  Do you slip into a different accent?  What makes you even consider the possibility of being the reborn soul of the one and only Carl Sagan.  Why not his cousin?  Or neigbor?  </p>

<p>Mapping r3-&gt;r2 means removing the 3rd dimension, which means you can&#39;t actually represent a 3d system in 2d, you have to lose information (there is no way to make a 1 to 1 3d-&gt;2d transformation)</p>

<p>&#39;Hyperspace&#39; means extradimensional space, that is, space with more than 3 dimensions/axes, but since all angles here are not 90 degrees, </p>

<p>Orthogonality.. might want to read up on it, things can still be essentially perpendicular in 4 dimensions.</p>

<p>Anyway you make basically no argument here. Imagine if I said 
&quot;911 was a hoax. If matrix A has only the trivial solution for Ax=0, then the column vectors are linearly independent. Autistic people are gifted in some weird way. Stuff about data.&quot; That&#39;s basically what you did. Random conspiracy concept+a bunch of unrelated linear algebra+a weird conjecture about autistic people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just when a new discovery came to light.</p>

<p>There was something in a capacity, sublime.</p>

<p>Something that would help generations to come, in their wit, desire, wisdom and might.</p>

<p>That capacity is empathy, my friends, and I say with some zeal and some zest.</p>

<p>That it would help you better understand the mess.</p>

<p>That, when combined with skepticism and science, it would help you get better insight.</p>

<p>Explaining boring concepts to unenthusiastic kids, possibly.</p>

<p>Explaining social issues to ignorant people, particularly.</p>

<p>Or trying to understand how a beloved feels, but with a margin for error maybe.</p>

<p>To lighten the mood, I would like to ask, &quot;I am the Doctor, and would you like a jelly baby?&quot;</p>

<p>But would you ignore this basic human capacity?</p>

<p>For something as existentially meaningless as statistics, as you may see.</p>

<p>We create our own meaning in our lives, I believe.</p>

<p>And while you check the links in my possibly-erroneous article,</p>

<p>I would like you to appreciate the beauty of science,</p>

<p>And mathematics and art too, my friends, like a chronicle.</p>

<p>And focus on the method, not the result.</p>

<p>For both science and art were monumental,</p>

<p>To the progress of something called the human civilization.</p>

<p>And I dedicate this poem to my beloved, with love.</p>

<p>For this is an ode to science, maths, literature, art and skepticism.</p>

<p>And, note this, fellow enthusiasts, here I come.</p>

<p>To save this world from possible self-destruction.</p>

<p>I will try as hard as I can, but you mustn&#39;t have any prior expectation.</p>

<p>For it is hard to find something as ideal as a permanent solution.</p>

<p>The last part is probably too narcissistic or naive, I guess. Saving the world from its eventual self-destruction is a collective enterprise and needs a lot of people. And, possibly unrelated to whatever I have said earlier or possibly not, it is my opinion that the purpose of this meaningless world is to appreciate the beauty of things and make others appreciate that beauty too.</p>
