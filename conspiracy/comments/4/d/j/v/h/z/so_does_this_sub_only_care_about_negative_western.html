Now I dont consider myself some type of free-market shill, but there are obviously more stories out there that dont involve America and some of the bigger western European countries.</p>

<p>So im wondering, are people here mostly just wanna be anarchist that dont like the establishment? Or is it that since most of us live in said countries, its easier to &#39;relate&#39; to locally based theories. Can yall not find dirt on actual well known corrupt countries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but the posts on here are heavily centered around western stories. Its understandable because most of reddit lives in western countries, but I was just wondering what the mindset of readers here were like. I try to stay unbiased and look to see things for what they are instead of what I think they should be.</p>

<p>Sure some theories on here can be absolutely true, yet as conspirators, you have to wonder whether theories are posted for truth, or because someone is trying to look edgy on the internet. And what better way to do that than bash American companies/etc.</p>

<p>What I think is that naturally, people on this sub will be more biased against whatever region they live in regardless of the availability of news.</p>

<p>Example, someone who lives in America will think a lot of horrible shit happens here, but will shrug off a story from another region because they think its acceptable that it happens there, but super immoral that it happens in America. Swap out what ever country you prefer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of good news stories from non-first world countries are not translated from their original language into English, and so don&#39;t spread very far from their origins.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to get wound up about Kyrgyz or Azeri corruption when that kind of stuff never makes it beyond local news, translated into English, and then published in a place where more readers might see it.</p>

<p>There is plenty of interesting corruption going on in the world, but you have to go looking for it in foreign publications which are likely to be posted in languages which few redditors read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll put it out there easier for you. </p>

<p>The Western Conspiracy control the other smaller conspiracy as they are directly connected to those conspiracies. Since the conspiracy itself is the central banking system, it is involved with the entire world. That is why the focus of America and Britain seem so large, the world is FED up with the <strong>system</strong> which is the actual focus, not the people themselves. </p>

<p>Thus leading people to read about the people behind the conspiracy, ending up with a target mentioned throughout history and bam, you have global conspiracy. Money is power in this reality, to change this reality you have to disarm it&#39;s power, money. This leads to what we are looking at right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sick of everyone pissing on the West, while at the same time struggling to get into Western countries so they can live off the labor of Western (white Christian) workers. I don&#39;t give a flying fuck about what happens to non-white, non-Christian nations. My people are white Christians. They are my blood, and they are the ones I give loyalty to.</p>

<p>Fuck the negroes both in America and in Africa. They never produced a damned thing of any value and they never will. They are low IQ savages with just about enough brains to stick together a mud hut and eat raw monkey meat while giving each other AIDS.</p>

<p>Fuck the Jews, who have never ceased to connive and work against white Christians, while all the while profiting and benefiting at the expense of white Christians. The Jews are our enemies, and you should NEVER forget that. They hate your guts. They hate the fact that your forefathers produced a civilization in which they are forced to live as an alien tribe. And even as they strive to gain control over OUR civilization, they are also trying to exterminate us through white genocide.</p>

<p>And fuck the Asians, who although they are intelligent and law-abiding, have no creative ability to speak about, and would, if they had the power, enslave all whites and rule in  white nations. Like all the peoples of the world, Asians hate whites because they envy what whites have created in the West.</p>

<p>The only reason we have enjoyed our present peace and prosperity, as whites, is our ability to exterminate any group that  dares to rise against us. Whites have overwhelming military power over all other races. If that changes, those other races will destroy us in a heartbeat. Whites should never forget this fact for an instant.</p>
