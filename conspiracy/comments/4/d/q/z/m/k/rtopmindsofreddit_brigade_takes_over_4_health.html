<p>Last month, badbiosvictim1 submitted a post in <a href="/r/health24">/r/health24</a>.

<p><strong>4) <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> is fourth sub <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> took over</strong></p>

<p>Badbiosvictim1 and I submitted posts in <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a>. Last month, I submitted a post warning that if the sole mod of <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> did not return by the 60th day, <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> was at risk of being taking over by <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> brigade.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, no subscriber requested <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> in <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> before <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> did. After <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> requested <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a>, I notified <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a>. A neurology resident submitted a request in <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>.</p>

<p>First come, first serve. <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> was first. Unfortunately, <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> does not require redditors to be subscribers or posters or have a medical background. If <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> had these requirements, the neurology resident would have been given <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> attempted to blackmail me</strong></p>

<p>Immediately after taking over <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> and removing some of my posts and comments, <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> PMs an ultimatum. His ultimatum constitutes blackmail.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/rANJPuL.png">http://i.imgur.com/rANJPuL.png</a></p>

<p>Since <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> took over <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a>, I neither posted in the sub nor updated the post on his alts and him.</p>

<p>Hypocritically, <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> removed all the posts on electromagnetic fields and banned me.</p>

<p><a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> accused my mod badbiosvictim1 of being my alt. A tactic <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> uses to destroy a sub is accusing its mods of being alts of each other. This is the third redditor <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> accused of being my alt. Because ragecry and a throwaway account defended me, <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> retaliated by accusing them of being my alts. He then attacked ragecry in <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>. Thereby, <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> intimidated other redditors from defending <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and its mods. I do not have an alt.</p>

<p><strong>P51Mike1980 banned totesmessenger to circumvent notifications of crossposts</strong></p>

<p>Totes messenger is also banned in <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> so no one can find their way from it to your shitty, poorly researched subs full of pseudoscience. :-)</p>

<p><a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a>&#39;s behavior confirmed <a href="/u/questioningliars">/u/questioningliars</a> was one of his alt accounts. Last month, <a href="/u/questioningliars">/u/questioningliars</a> requested the mods of <a href="/r/medicine">/r/medicine</a> to remove totesmessenger notification of a crosspost in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>:</p>

<p><strong>P51Mike1980 censors papers in medical journals that are not free</strong></p>

<p><a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> created rules in the sidebar. Rule #1 prohibits papers published by medical journals which charge a fee to read the full text. Abstracts are free to read.</p>

<p>1.If you post a study or journal piece include a short submission statement summarizing the piece so people can know what the study is about. Please post to links to full studies that are not paywalls. There are ways to find studies without paywalls.</p>

<p>Majority of papers are published in medical journals that charge a fee. He did not instruct how to lawfully find papers without paywalls without violating copyright laws. He is censoring papers.</p>

<p>This is not the first health sub <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> unduly influenced to censor papers. Eight months ago, <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> unduly influenced <a href="/r/ALS">/r/ALS</a> to make it restrictive, to remove papers on EMF and censor all papers:</p>

<p>&quot;As a support sub, most of our posters are not scientific experts. Articles about ALS are welcome but high-level scientific research papers should be submitted in more appropriate subs such as <a href="/r/Science">/r/Science</a>.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a>, founding mod of <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> wants his sub back</strong></p>

<p><a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> concealed that the founding mod, <a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a>, requested to be restored as a mod. <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> removed his comment. I discovered the comment in <a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a>&#39;s submission history:</p>

<p>[–]brain_doc 0 points 13 hours ago</p>

<p>So I just found out that you had yourself added as a moderator, and had me removed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you weren&#39;t happy with my moderation, but I was happy with how the sub was running.</p>

<p>Can you please add me back? I am not inactive; just hands-off because I don&#39;t like censorship.</p>

<p>[–]brain_doc 1 point 12 hours ago Well... I just checked on this account, and found out I had the subreddit taken away from me by a mod of<a href="/r/DirtyElectricity/">/r/DirtyElectricity/</a> Crazy.</p>

<p>Where do you appeal decisions like this? I am really frustrated by how this happened.</p>

<p><a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a> submitted a post asking how to appeal:</p>

<p>When redditors become mods, Reddit should give instructions including that two months of inactivity entitles any one regardless of education or training to request their sub.</p>

<p>I requested <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> to return <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> to <a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a> or at least restore him as a mod. <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> refused.</p>

<p>Update: Due to this post, <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a> allowed <a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a> to return as a mod but he is no longer the head mod.  <a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a> has to be submissive to <a href="/u/P51Mike1980">/u/P51Mike1980</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/topmindsofreddit is a pro-brigading sub. They downvote my comments, putting me at a -100 karma, which then prevents me from spreading my ideas and wisdom more efficiently. They have UTTERLY DESTROYED all the hard work I have put into reddit, and therefore my fanbase suffers as a result. Any subreddit that seeks to laugh at ideas is a pro-bullying subreddit, and therefore should be taken down like how fatpeoplehate was taken down. They are probably reading this post this very second, with intent to find my comment in this thread, go through my post history, and then encourage even more downvoting of my answers. Given that a lot of reddit mods are NSA shills, I am probably on a government watchlist by now, only because I dare challenge the leftist cultural narrative of transgenderism being natural and not the result of a systemic feminist estrogen poisoning campaign (my existence, as an ex-trans, seems to BLOW THEIR MINDS), and how reptilians are actually real (and how I&#39;m not a schizophrenic or paranoid, like how so many of them are insistent upon me being).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well--after that one post by that one admin after the whole PlanetSide2 500 word essay debacle, I was under the impression that it was removed as an official violation of rules.<br/>
I appealed to get off shadowban after that admin&#39;s post, and the friendly admin who unbanned me essentially said to &#39;not vote brigade again--or else.&#39; Well I actually did vote brigade (though it was only an eensy bit, and I do play PS2 and visit the sub on my own. Look at me making excuses :D ), but I was under the impression that it was essentially fine to now. And now that I know there are people <em>hired</em> to vote brigade, hoo boy?<br/>
I don&#39;t know, It&#39;s just...<br/>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbuster">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbuster</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A cloudbuster (or cloud buster) is a pseudoscientific device designed by Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, which Reich said <strong>could produce rain by manipulating</strong> what he called &quot;orgone energy&quot; present in <strong>the atmosphere</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound familiar? The City of Los Angeles has about 10 rainmaking devices aka cloud seeding devices:</p>

<p><a href="http://abc7.com/science/cloud-seeding-used-to-coax-more-rain-during-socal-storms/1242227/">http://abc7.com/science/cloud-seeding-used-to-coax-more-rain-during-socal-storms/1242227/</a></p>

<p>Looks pretty similar to Reich&#39;s don&#39;t they!</p>

<p>Speaking of cloudbusters and orgone energy...I&#39;m seeing some major parallels to Cloud Strife, his Buster Sword, the Lifestream, and energy corporation Shinra from the game Final Fantasy VII. Damn interesting.</p>

<p>&quot;Mobile phone radiation induces mode-dependent DNA damage in a mouse spermatocyte-derived cell line: a protective role of melatonin.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well spotted, it ran deep.</p>

<p>When I posted about trolls/shills/bot that tried to make repugnant behaviours socially acceptable my post was deleted due to rule 12. They appear on facebook posts by certain pages to inflame people and &quot;break consensus&quot;. For instance while on the topic that people were agreeing on the importance of love comments would appear from &quot;posters&quot; that said stuff like &quot;Love does not pay the bills&quot; &quot;Good luck with that when you are broke and starving&quot;.</p>

<p>Also that sort of thing goes on on pornography websites and sex related topics. Comments that advocate and brigade certain behaviours if one has been in 4chan for example you would likely know what I refereed to. In addition some of the content may be contrived by masquerading as &quot;amateur&quot; or &quot;home made&quot; material. Its not very easy for someone to recognise that whilst sexually aroused and to scrutinise the pornographic content. Prostitutes could be hired to perform a &quot;cheating wife with such and such as hubby watches&quot; &quot;amateur&quot; video. </p>
