    <div class="md"><p>They have a working conscience.  It&#39;s just only shown to their immediate family and friends.  We don&#39;t count.  We are seen as less than they are - as less than human.</p>

<p>Do you eat meat?  I assume you do - as most Westerners do.  A good argument can be made then that most of us humans cannot be said to have a good, working conscience either where it regards not harming non-human animals and other sentient life.  Most of us call ourselves moral, but we have no problem eating the meat of a butchered cow, the leg of a murdered bird, or draping the skin of another being who was killed for it over our shoulders (or on our hands, feet, or legs).</p>

<p>In the case of the .01%, it is <em>we</em> who are looked upon as not being worthy of any consideration.  The .01% definitely have a conscience.  It&#39;s just not extended to <em>us</em>.  It&#39;s applied only toward those beings that they see as being &quot;worthy&quot; of it...and they don&#39;t put us in that category.  It&#39;s similar to how most humans look upon non-human beings.  Most people think they are &quot;better&quot; and &quot;more evolved&quot; than anything that isn&#39;t human.</p>

<p>The elite think the same way.  It&#39;s just that to them, we aren&#39;t human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.  Racism is another window into this phenomenon.  A racist can brutally torture and murder a member of the race they hate, go home, kiss their wife, tuck in their kids, genuinely love <em>them</em> and have a good night&#39;s sleep.</p>

<p>The thing is that we turn empathy on and off based on what we perceive to be our equals.  For some, all humans are equal and for those people the pain and joy of all other humans would matter to them if they observed it.  For others, some humans are inferior and for those others the pain and joy of some humans does not register in the same way in their minds.  Some people even extend their empathy to animals.  It&#39;s even possible to extend it to some animals and not to certain humans.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about the disassociation of personal identity from the subject.  THAT is what allows people to be callous to the subject.</p>

<p>So, we shouldn&#39;t elect people that are callous to the pain and joy of segments of the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Racism is another window into this phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, sir/ma’am.  You are correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A racist can brutally torture and murder a member of the race they hate, go home, kiss their wife, tuck in their kids, genuinely love them and have a good night&#39;s sleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this.  Very appropriate example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For some, all humans are equal and for those people the pain and joy of all other humans would matter to them if they observed it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this as well.  However, even for those who consider all humans “equal”, it is important to dig deeper and <em>really</em> find out just who and what these people consider “a human being” to be.  This is, believe it or not, an important qualifier because 120 years ago, say, a white person in America could say “all humans are equal” with a completely straight face in one moment, and then proceed to put on a white hood and go take part in the remorseless lynching of a black person the next moment - and they wouldn’t consider such a paradoxical abomination as being contradictory in the least.</p>

<p>As such, you are right in saying that it’s important to consider all humans equal.  However, it’s also important to consider all <em>different races</em> and ethnicities of people as being humans as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s all about the disassociation of personal identity from the subject. THAT is what allows people to be callous to the subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very correct.</p>

<p>I often say and feel that “all is One”.  I try to imbue what this means in my life as often and as much as possible - though I admit it is often not easy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we shouldn&#39;t elect people that are callous to the pain and joy of segments of the population.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this wholeheartedly.  What this means, however, is that we would likely have to kick literally <em>everybody</em> out that is in office presently and replace them with a completely different order of people.  I’m all for this, by the way…but we might encounter a touch of resistance along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you to an extent. However, eating meat is a function of the requirement  to gather energy for our physical processes from the material available to us.

<p>No it isn’t.  It’s a function of our laziness and ignorance.  Nothing more.  We don’t need meat to survive.  Not in the least.  Matter of fact, study after study show that a non-meat diet is <em>significantly</em> healthier for the human body.</p>

<p>Jesus I don’t even…</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I haven’t eaten meat in over eleven years - my girlfriend in over seventeen.</p>

<p>You should go take a visit to <a href="/r/vegetarian">/r/vegetarian</a> and <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a> and check it out over there.</p>

<p>So do we.  Most of us just don’t realize it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It shows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  It does.</p>

<p>EDIT:  None of this is meant to turn into any sort of “eat meat” vs “don’t eat meat” debate.  Not in the least.  I’ve been a non-meat eater for as long as I have, but I’m also not a 12 year old.  Before I stopped eating meat , I ate it just as much as (if not more than) the next person.  As such, I’m not judging you or anyone else for eating it.  This is the society we live in.  However, what I <em>am</em> saying is that we most certainly don’t <em>have</em> to eat meat.  There’s absolutely nothing nutritionally necessary in its consumption that we cannot get from non-meat products.  Additionally (and again) not eating meat is actually <em>healthier</em>.  It’s healthier for our bodies, it’s healthier for the planet, and it’s a <em>hell</em> of a lot healthier for the animals we’re killing and eating.</p>

<p>You see how you’ve reacted to this whole “eating meat” dynamic, however?  You haven’t been mean or a jerk here in the least, so that’s not what I’m saying.  However, you very matter of factly made a very confident argument for why it <em>is</em> in fact right and indeed <em>necessary</em> for us to eat meat.  Think about that mentality you illustrated there for a minute.  It’s the result of an indoctrination that’s been pounded into you from <em>birth</em> by society - one you wholeheartedly buy, no longer question (if you ever actually did question it in the first place), and absolutely take very much for granted as fact; as “just the way things are”.</p>

<p>You don’t think for a moment about the harm we human beings cause to all other non-human beings we kill and consume.  And why don’t you think about it?  Well, you don’t think about it because you were born and raised to think that human beings are “the most important beings”.  If a thing isn’t a human being, then it’s okay to kill and eat it.  It’s just as simple as that.</p>

<p>Does that make you a bad person, however?</p>

<p>No.  It doesn’t.  You have a mom and a dad and possibly some siblings, and friends, extended family, etc…and I’m sure you all love each other very much and have exhibited and extended great acts of warmth and love toward one another.</p>

<p>However, there’s likely not a chicken or a cow or a sheep or a lamb in existence that wouldn’t look at you and your family and say <em>exactly</em> the same thing that you said in your OP about the elite.  It is <em>you</em> who don’t have a “working conscience” for them.  That much is certain.</p>

<p>Yet you <em>do</em> have a working conscience, right?  You <em>do</em>.  You just don’t apply it to anyone or anything that’s not in your circle.</p>

<p>Same modus operandi tends to apply to many groups - including the elite.</p>

<p>None of this is to try to excuse the elite.  It is, however, to let us know that - deleterious as are the actions of the elite against the 99% - we the people won’t be able to do much about it until we collectively raise our <em>own</em> level of consciousness up significantly and become more aware of our connection to the planet, our connection to each other, and our connection to all other beings living here with us.  Once we do that, then the harm being caused to us by the elite will be <em>so</em> obvious and glaring that we’ll be able to see right through all the undermining indoctrination they’ve brainwashed us with from birth, come together as the one people and species that we indeed are, move collectively/together <em>against</em> their manipulation, and then break free from it all toward a better planet and civilization.</p>

<p>We must first raise our level of individual and collective consciousness, however, and respect all life in general to such an extent that we no longer support the manipulation that we perpetrate upon other non-humans, and that we allow the elite to perpetrate upon <em>us</em>.</p>

<p>It’s all connected.</p>

<p>That will simply not help them retain their power in the face of overwhelming  public opinion. If we opposed them with violent revolution their violence would be  effective though. They can hire endless numbers of mercenaries.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not talking about taking any of them out of positions they already hold. I&#39;m talking about causing their replacements, as they come along, to become more human.  It&#39;s not a sudden change but it would still be quick.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really only two options in my book, the hard way and the easy way.</p>

<p>The easy way would be to rise up as a whole, destroy their symbols and break their institutions, by fire and blood. The tree bares poison fruit, so we cut it down. Many will perish, and the net-result remains completely up the air. Historically, probably more of the same.</p>

<p>The hard way is we strike at the root of the issue, which is simply people&#39;s belief that our current system is the &quot;best we can do&quot;, or that &quot;we can change this shit by doing the same things again&quot;. People&#39;s beliefs that they are powerless in the face of these forces. People&#39;s beliefs that there isn&#39;t enough, and that they have an exclusive line on the correct path a soul should take. People&#39;s beliefs that they have the right to imprison or kill.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure what led you to that conclusion. Wherein my responses do I give the impression that I want the world to burn, exactly?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to take the easy way either here...Changing what people believe they are capable of doing will be the most effective way to heal this society, and it will prove to be the most difficult. People have built their entire lives on beliefs, and they are often the strongest things people possess. </p>

<p>How can you hope to swing public opinion when people just don&#39;t care? They don&#39;t care anymore because they no longer believe they can do anything about it. Thus, the only path to change is to educate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they are. Let me tell you why that doesn&#39;t matter. They will fake it, they will lie and they will fool people at least for a little while.</p>

<p>If the  vast public wants a show of conscience then our example  animalistic leader needs to hide his uncivilized behavior, like making excuses for torture for instance. It&#39;s  the way racists must hide their racism from the open public. You can still  be a racist in 2016 but you better not let it get to be a label that the public puts on you.</p>

<p>The magic of that is that there are automatically less opportunities for them to act  in ways that make their true intentions obvious. </p>

<p>Less opportunity to do evil (or even practice racism as in my earlier  example) means an actual reduction in the actual evil done.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what they do to hide it. Their practices  would have  to be reduced to an amount that can be hidden.  Public relief would follow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who can&#39;t provide evidence of having a working conscience should never have power over others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;ll just fake it. If you don&#39;t believe me, look at all the shit people do just to get into &quot;the right school&quot;. </p>

<p>Besides that, you need another power that can supervise/decide who&#39;s eligible for leadership and who isn&#39;t. Any such group itself would be a target for corruption and/or subversion by those who seek power for their own selfish gains.</p>

<p>There is an alternative though. In some African traditional cultures, there are secret societies the exist. The function of these societies is to act as a counter-balance to the power of an &quot;unworthy chief&quot;. In one way, this is a similar concept to the checks and balances found in the American constitutional system. </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably no coincidence that the political constitution of the US is based on the Masonic concept of a constitution. Most people aren&#39;t aware of this, but Mason&#39;s lodges all have their own constitution and that the Masonic idea of a constitution predates that of the US.</p>

<p>So why bring Freemasons into this? Because they might very well be an example of a secret society similar to the African ones I mentioned earlier. A group of people that act to balance or counter the actions of an unworthy leader.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they may also have been corrupted or subverted by those same people long ago.</p>
