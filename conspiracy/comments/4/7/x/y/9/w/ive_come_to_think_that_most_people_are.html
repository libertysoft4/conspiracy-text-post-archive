    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m sure this will get buried in this thread, but relevant to this post is this: I remember from before I was born, being shown earth and what it means to take on a body.</p>

<p>This earth is a prison. Your soul is literally imprisoned in a hell existence where you are entirely disconnected from your true self, and programmed and enslaved by programs that make up your ego (which is a phantom and not you).</p>

<p>The levels of your slavery run so deep that you would even argue with me from your untrue self to keep your own lie valid,</p>

<p>Most esoteric and mystical religions/paths speak about this in depth and that&#39;s the biggest conspiracy on this whole site</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say in earnest because I only know life as a woman at this point. The memory I shared previously is the only one I have of anything that happened before &quot;this&quot;.</p>

<p>Intellectually I can see that life as a woman has serious disadvantages. Periods, pregnancy, etc being the biggest ones in my mind. Biologically I think we for sure have it harder.
Apart from that life as a woman isn&#39;t too bad, unless you&#39;re unlucky enough to have been born into a backwards culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reply. Yeah I was thinking periods/cramps/preg, and the emphasis on appearance with make up/clothes on how long it takes to get ready just from observing ex-gf&#39;s/sister/mom. For me, its shower/shave/clothes and I&#39;m out the door in 10 minutes....or 5 if I showered the day before.</p>

<p>Also when it comes to dating, you guys have it easy because the guy, culturally, approaches the girl. I never really ever had a girl approach except in in different countries that I&#39;ve visited where its okay. And I&#39;m not the type to go chasing anyone anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that if I go too long without a GF, then there;s this lack of being balanced by the feminine energy I get out of relationships. It really balances me and its the &quot;thing&quot; that we fall in love with in women. Its a specific essence/energy/small/softness/look, etc. </p>

<p>My ex also said, after X amount of not being with anyone, that my masculine energy would rub off on her and balance her out as well, like she really needed it. There&#39;s definitely something to it.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m never coming back here again, but if I absolutely had to, i&#39;d would probably be as a guy again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m unsure how you can prove this to yourself. If I go into deep meditation and suddenly feel as if (suddenly &quot;realize&quot;) I&#39;m actually a species of interstellar ghost who is inhabiting a human body just because space is lonely, it doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s true, even though it <em>really does feel like it&#39;s true</em>, especially in the moment.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your take on this and have been refuted with the &quot;false&quot; memory argument, however the memorie(s) come from a place prior to subconscious or conscious thought, from an entirely different place that has nothing to do with imagination or day dreaming.</p>

<p>The memory itself, had me as pure consciousness, genderless and with no body. It was unmistakably &quot;me&quot; in that memory, but without a body or gender. So if you access your memories about something you did a while back, you know inherently that it was ultimately &quot;you&quot;, or pure subjectivity, that was there when that event happen, and that it wasn&#39;t anyone else but you in that event (besides who else was involved).</p>

<p>Even if you come up with some day dreams/illusions/create false memories, you still know/feel inherently that its &quot;you&quot; to whom these illusions are occuring to.</p>

<p>Also, when I got a preview of prison/hell planet earth, it was so shocking and traumatic that I contracted into myself as consciousness from the crap/shit that I picked up of what goes on here on earth. That reaction was deeply embedded in my soul and in this life from the very start, a sort of introverted distrust of all things, people, existence, earth, body, etc...and its taken quite some time in resolving that which has stick with me since then......still healing from that in this life.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m 99% sure the memory is legit, because I have opened an aspect of the heart that the memory was in, and that place also shows me things that have occurred in my life in later times. I&#39;ve seen things that logical mind would say, &quot;Ha, yeah right that would never happen,&quot; and then there I am a month or so later exactly in the situation just like I saw</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s a very simple IT problem. when parents with high SAT schools or an advanced degree check into a hospital and give birth, the computer tells the nurse to use vaccine vial UBX-5832 rather than UBX-3981</p>

<p>very effective, as it not only occupies the intelligent parents with caring for the sick/dying child rather than thinking too hard about govt or how to overcome it, but it also ends the gene propagation because the sick child will never reproduce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought that the later routine vaccines throughout the first 2 years were the ones more likely to cause vaccine injuries, think Dtap, meningitis/measles (i forget which one is worse)... My son was born in a birth center with a midwife and didn&#39;t get newborn vaccines. My daughter was born in the hospital (for financial reasons, but still a natural birth) and did receive those newborn vacccines. However, I vaccinated my son up until 2 years, whereas my daughter only received her 2 month shots, none else.. And coincidentally, my son gets eczema on his legs and is <em>always</em> sicker than his younger sister whenever a cold goes around, whereas she has an <em>awesome</em> immune system. They were breastfed for 13 and 18 months, respectively, though, so that might have had an impact on the elders immune system! But not the eczema because that began at 2 months! (Right around his first set of vaxes -_-) I always thought vaccine injury was more likely from a  <em>buildup</em> of vaccine crap in the body causing problems..</p>

<p>MMR, its  the cheap mass produced quick multi vaccine.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s suppose that you&#39;re a master and you wish to breed a population of slaves. You would select for individuals who passively believe whatever you tell them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re probably right. In fact, I suspect that this happened a few thousand years ago and has been going on ever since. </p>

<p>How did it work? Let&#39;s say during the beginning of the agricultural age, some &quot;leaders&quot; noticed that some people made better farm workers than other. So they decided to promote docile obedient bloodlines and repress aggressive disobedient ones. </p>

<p>How would this work? Simple. Just make up a bunch of rules related to human behavior that is related to aggression. Stuff like sex, violence and robbery. The leadership (elite bloodlines) proclaim that these forms of behavior are &quot;wrong&quot; because they say so. Over time, these rules become accepted as cultural norms and anyone that is unable to control their own (naturally aggressive) behavior related to these norms is weeded out of the gene pool.</p>

<p>In ancient times, this would have been accomplished by banishment, execution, prison or wars. It would be 100% effective, but over many generations people would gradually become &quot;tamer&quot;. Meanwhile, the elites retained the rights to act naturally and kept right on doing so.</p>

<p>Basically we&#39;re talking about the domestication of human beings.</p>

<p>One last thought, domesticated animals are usually more docile and less intelligent than their wild cousins.</p>

<p>if you want (a laugh) to test how slavish random people are, then tell or ask them this simple fact or question.</p>

<p>&#39;how many years was J. Edgar Hoover director of the FBI&#39;</p>

<p>then mention his cross dressing and Clyde Tolson his long term deputy and lover.</p>

<p>observe their minds cringing and shriveling before your eyes. </p>

<p>Hoover and Tolson and who they worked for is mind blowing govt and DoJ corruption, nearly fifty years of corruption at the highest level. its mind-blowing for people who know about and follow these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think what you&#39;re preaching is dumb. I used to be really into conspiracies and they never did anything good for me.

<p>You don&#39;t get anyone on your side calling us slaves either. Even if you think you&#39;re enlightened to how the world works, you still follow it&#39;s rules. You&#39;re as much as a slave as anyone else who isn&#39;t the ruling class. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy. If tomorrow everything gets disclosed and it turns out that <em>every single</em> conspiracy theory was true, I&#39;m still going to be happy. So you can take your &quot;no happy slave&quot; and shove it up your ass. </p>
