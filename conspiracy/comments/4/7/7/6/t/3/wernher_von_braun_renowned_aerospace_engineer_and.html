It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.” </p>

<p>So what&#39;s your point? If you would have told me 15 years ago cars would drive themselves, I would have laughed in your face. However, now that we have the technology, it&#39;s very much possible. </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that man doesn&#39;t belong out there. Man belongs wherever he wants to go — and he&#39;ll do plenty well when he gets there.&quot; (Time magazine 17 February 1958)</p>

<p>&quot;If we continue at this leisurely pace, we will have to pass Russian customs when we land on the moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What we will have attained when Neil Armstrong steps down upon the moon is a completely new step in the evolution of man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everybody knows what the moon is, everybody knows what this decade is, and everybody can tell a live astronaut who returned from the moon from one who didn&#39;t.&quot;  von Braun</p>

<p>&quot;My friends they were dancing here in the streets of Huntsville when our first satellite orbited the Earth. They were dancing again when the first Americans landed on the Moon. I&#39;d like to ask you, don&#39;t hang up your dancing slippers.&quot;</p>
