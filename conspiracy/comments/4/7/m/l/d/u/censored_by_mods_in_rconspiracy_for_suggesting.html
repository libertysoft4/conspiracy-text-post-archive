<p>It was because you stated that <strong>the Snowden papers</strong> made a revelation about underground hominids, and I don&#39;t think there is any evidence of his NSA leaked papers suggesting that. If you can provide some credible evidence that the Snowden papers do mention underground hominids, I will re-approve your post.</p>

<p>I read that article and then searched for any other articles corroborating it.  There aren&#39;t any.  It really looks like a fraudulent article.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s great that you removed it.  Removing articles that are obviously bullshit keeps this subreddit from being stovepiped.  That is, if people get to post fraudulent BS here, that discredits the sub, and some agencies might even do it on purpose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a judgment call. Most posts are matters of opinion, and we don&#39;t censor opinions. However, where a post makes a statement which is clearly and demonstrably false - not just misleading - then I think we do need to remove it.</p>

<p>I think Snowden is a limited hangout. Maybe this post gets people to look into Hollow Earth and when they see how much is out there relating to that, realize Snowden hasn&#39;t given us much at all besides a bit of big brother fear.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now not allowed to post a certain satirical video about 9/11 again or else I&#39;ll be banned for 72 hours because it was deemed a &#39;meme&#39; after being voted on. I don&#39;t think it was technically a meme but I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s so convenient to have vague rules..</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to get make the sub overrun with memes but they&#39;re fucking effective vehicles for spreading information that should be used to our advantage. For example the top post right now has 1400 upvotes, 200 comments with some good discussion and it&#39;s clearly a meme post. </p>

<p>Edit: upon further investigation the discussion in that thread has kind of devolved, doesn&#39;t change the rest of what I said though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t remove it, I did search for the headline though and found zero evidence of him saying it <em>in an interview</em>. If I wanted to get people to discredit Snowden for themselves this is exactly the method I suspect would work. Post this to beforeitsnews and watch it spreadd across the blogosphere with zero credibility. If you can find evidence please post it though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because someone had to go into damage control because it was already pretty well known about and there needed to be a release valve for the pressure. Why hasn&#39;t he dumped the rest? Who is he to decide whether I can handle the truth? Why does he get all the coverage while Binney remains unknown or Manning rots in solitary?</p>

<p>What privacy measures does he advocate? Which encryption standards does he endorse considering many of them are compromised? Will a bunch of people now run off to use Telegram (conveniently created by Russian hackers to break free from Putin&#39;s reign of terror on free speech) which itself is compromised and the NSA has now greatly increased signal to noise ratio? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t dump any of it if you recall, journos did. If you recall anyone who listened to Binney was a &#39;crazy conspiracist&#39; before the Guardian blew the lid, the ordinary folk had no clue whatsoever. I&#39;d be more impressed if he&#39;d have dumped the lot after the media drip feed but that&#39;s a surefire way of getting &#39;offed&#39;.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>And Laura and Glen went and made a nice big doco out of their meeting with him, which went on to receive lots of accolades in the controlled media, i watched his talk from his robot avatar at SXSW circulate facebook like wildfire on facebook among my &quot;activist SJW&quot; friends, still hasn&#39;t got the nose piece fixed on his glasses yet. Life must be tough on the run for poor Snowden. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just fear mongering. We don&#39;t have privacy. You can project your consciousness to any point within the universe and observe from that space, you can have trips where you are a molecule on the lid of a jar in your pantry and see a family member open it and unscrew you. It&#39;s all connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A big problem presented by this idea other than the magnetic field is the planets centre of gravity as it can be viewed as being relatively central to the planet, if there was a big hole and water freely flowed between the inner world and the outer world what is stopping all the planets&#39; water from pooling in the centre?</p>

<p>The reality is nothing would stop it, simple logical experiments can easily prove to oneself how unlikely something is, hollow earth is more unlikely than actual ET&#39;s whilst the idea of underground civilizations isn&#39;t, in fact it&#39;s documented globally from India to turkey; we even have underground societies setting up all manner of crazy venues in the catacombs of Paris which have barely been explored.</p>

<p>In regards to underground ET bases, really? Why would they need bases on our planet? They can traverse the stars, in fact because the actual answer to Fermi&#39;s paradox is rather simple we are an experiment being conducted to truly determine the answer to Drake&#39;s equation (no brainer if you think about it) they will have bases etc to monitor humans (reacted pretty quickly to nukes) but not on our planet because they wouldn&#39;t want to fuck the experiment up. The moon is actually the perfect staging platform and may be it&#39;s actual purpose, if you haven&#39;t looked into the anomalous nature of the moon do so and also have a look at a man called Giodarno Bruno he was a rather interesting martyr to say the least. I have actually just laid out for you the real ET conspiracy</p>

<p>the story is, the gentler beings went underground during atlantis and lemuria and other times and they have lived there peacefully ever since.  they are far advanced and can take down our weapons and they have advanced UFOs...but it&#39;s all anecdotal.  i have seen several UFOs personally on Mt.

<p>There have been several stories in the past that have tried using Edward Snowden&#39;s name to try and legitimize an obviously fake story,  such as; </p>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.su/2013/07/13/nsa-whistleblower-ed-snowden-saddam-hussein-did-wtc-7-2/">Edward Snowden Leaked Document Says Saddam Hussein Ordered Building 7 Demolition</a></p>

<p>To use Snowden&#39;s revelations as a plug for ETs in the earth, when no such thing exists, that certainly sounds like cause for deletion to me. </p>

<p>If there are examples of the mods deleting relevant or interesting stuff -- like Miles Mathis&#39;s work, which I&#39;ve seen deleted twice -- I&#39;d like to hear more about it. But stiffing guys who are just making shit up, I think they can go. </p>
