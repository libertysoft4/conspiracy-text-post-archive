<p>The film presents documentary evidence showing that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did not act alone, and that in fact the killings at the school were perpetrated by a satanic cult composed largely of graduates. Virtually the entire presentation is composed of the tens of thousands of records released by the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office.</p>

<p>One of the suspected cult members had a father who was a psychologist for the FBI and Air Force who had been an on scene supervisor at the Montana Freeman and Waco sieges. He was appointed to head the investigation of the massacre, despite the fact that his son clearly belonged to this group and had produced a film of trench-coated gunman shooting up the school for video class in 1997. </p>

<p>The group spoke German at meetings, tested explosives together at a nearby restaurant where they all worked and were part of a larger satanic subculture in the region involved in cutting, bloodletting, violence and sadistic pedophilia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is nonsense, and it hurts the case of legitimate conspiracies when people argue for nonsense. I don&#39;t even know where to start with this. Just off the top of my head:</p>

<p>Harris and Klebold were not part of the &quot;Trench Coat Mafia.&quot; They were friends with a couple of people who were and there was nothing sinister about the group; it was just a bunch of dumb kids who wanted to be ~provocative~ and thought they looked bad-ass in dusters. </p>

<p>Many shots WERE fired in the school after Harris and Klebold were dead; they were fired by the SWAT teams who were systematically sweeping the school for hours and shooting their way through locked doors. </p>

<p>Chris Morris, one of the supposed other shooters, was a) not even at the school when the shooting happened and b) called 911 himself to tell them what he knew when he realized the shooters were probably Harris and Klebold. The cops tried for ages to nail him and others for being involved in the conspiracy and couldn&#39;t come up with anything. If he was a shooter, how did he get away from the school? And then after he made his escape through the hundreds and hundreds of cops in a perimeter around the school, why would he call 911 and offer himself up?</p>

<p>Morris was quite publicly arrested that day when he came forward as one of Harris and Klebold&#39;s friends, which would have planted the idea that he was involved in the minds of a lot of kids. All of the witness statements that mention Morris cited in the video were taken long after the actual event, when all the witnesses memories (which are notoriously unreliable anyway) would have been tainted by all the media coverage. Students said ALL KINDS of patently false things to investigators and the media after hearing them from other sources. It became a ridiculous echo chamber of rumors and nonsense. </p>

<p>Supposed sightings of multiple gunmen are pretty easily explained by a) the chaos of the event and the general unreliability of witnesses perceptions and recollections, b) the wardrobe changes Harris and Klebold went through, c) misidentification, like the reports of the A/C repairman on the roof being a third shooter, and d) the sound of explosions from pipe bombs or gunfire from SWAT creating the impression that there were shooters in many more areas than there actually were. </p>

<p>Harris and Klebold both extensively documented their plans for the attack for a year in both their journals and recordings. They never said a word about anyone else being involved; it was always and explicitly the two of them. There&#39;s just no compelling evidence of there being any other shooters that day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being someone with family who was at the school during this incident, I can&#39;t agree more. This is just empty fishing, and false unfounded &quot;facts&quot; . Klebold and Harris may have set a precedent for the government, but they weren&#39;t a part of a satanic cult, I mean they were teenagers.. Why is it always a satanic cult with these people. The world is not Jesus versus Satan.. It&#39;s barely good versus evil, and if your definition of good is Jesus then you may be missing out on the big picture, or the original prime conspiracy/lie. Anyways, Klebold and Harris acted alone, the evidence pointing to them acting soleley is astounding. From my cousin, they were always outcasts, picked on a lot, and always seemed to be hard to connect with. This is your typical mass murderer/psychopath definition. &#39;Satanic cult&#39;, are you serious? Get a life Jesus freaks.</p>

<p>You seem to be under the mistaken impression that I am a religious fundamentalist. In the words of Carl Raschke, Ph.D., who is the Director of the Institute for Humanities at the University of Denver, Satanism is not simply a religion but a <em>&quot;sophisticated and highly effective motivational system for the spread of violence and cultural terrorism.&quot;</em></p>

<p>The existence of satanic cults <a href="http://whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html">is a</a> <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/satanism2.html">well-documented fact.</a> Not only do they exist, but they are involved in criminal activity ranging from drug, arms and human trafficking, as well as the production and distribution of child pornography and likely many of America&#39;s <em>&quot;unsolved murders.&quot;</em> Satanic elements have been involved in a great number of <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/satanism2.html">well-documented court cases.</a></p>

<p><em>Unspeakable Acts</em>, Congden and Weed, 1986, by counselor Jan Hollingsworth is a lengthy, well-documented text outlining a ritual abuse case at a daycare in Florida involving multiple perpetrators and victims. The case was successfully prosecuted.</p>

<p><em>Mortal Remains</em>, Harper Collins, 1991,  by Henry Scammell describes a well-documented series of ritual murders in Fall River, Massachusetts - the former home of Lizzie Borden - committed by a local Satanic cult.</p>

<p><em>Ritual Abuse</em>, Seal Books, 1988, by journalist Kevin Marron, details a ritual abuse case involving a Canadian preschool and that was successfully prosecuted.</p>

<p><em>The Franklin Cover-Up</em>, AWT, 1992, by John DeCamp and <em>The Franklin Scandal</em> by Nick Bryant produce reams of documentary evidence showing that a Satanic cult involved in child prostitution, child pornography and the production and distribution of &#39;snuff films,&#39; existed at the highest levels of Omaha&#39;s political and corporate leadership. This ring had ties to the national intelligence services and to the White House.</p>

<p><em>Raising Hell</em>, Avon, 1993, by Michael Newton was a comprehensive overview of Satanic crime. <em>The New Satanists</em>, Warner Books, 1994, by Linda Blood, a former mistress of satanist leader Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, has also written a compelling, well-documented history of satanic crime. </p>

<p><em>Gods and Beasts: The Nazis and the Occult</em>, Cromwell, 1977, and <em>Unholy Alliance</em>, Avon, 1995, by Peter Levenda, detail how occult groups in Germany created and largely controlled the Nazi Party. </p>

<p><em>The Family</em> by Ed Sanders, Dutton, 1971, demonstrates that the Manson Family did in fact have extensive ties to the Church of Satan, the Process Church and other satanic groups. <em>The Ultimate Evil</em> by Maury Terry, Dolphin Doubleday, 1987, presents a wealth of highly compelling evidence linking the Process Church to the Son of Sam murders. Terry&#39;s research, part of which demonstrated that there were clearly multiple perpetrators involved in the killings, led the Queens District Attorney&#39;s Office to reopen the case.</p>

<p>Then there is <em>Cults That Kill</em>, Warner Books, 1988, by Larry Kahaner, who collected accounts of satanic cults from law enforcement personnel across the country.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Dr. Raschke, director of the Institute of Humanities at the University of Denver, wrote <em>Painted Black</em>, Harper &amp; Row, 1990, which also analyzes occult crime and, like some of the other texts here, details the extensive connections between the satanic movement  and the neo-Nazi movement.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-04-18/features/8803090965_1_satanic-bible-satanic-graffiti-satanic-cults">the Chicago Tribune</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite rising concerns about satanism, its ideas are hardly new. According to historians, satanic cults have been documented in Europe and America as far back as the 1600s.</p>

<p>I agree that the motivations likely were not financial, although they always cause the budget of law enforcement agencies to expand. </p>

<p>These events also always create profits for the security industry, as schools equip themselves with cameras, metal detectors, motion sensor systems, alarm systems and many other ominous features that create an atmosphere that resembles a prison more closely than it does an educational instittuion.</p>

<p>I think Dave McGowan <a href="http://whale.to/b/gowan1.html">wrote a very good summary of the motive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The true goal is to further traumatize and brutalize the American people. This has in fact been a primary goal of the state for quite some time, dating back at least to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>The strategy is now (as it was then) to inflict blunt force trauma on all of American society, and by doing so to destroy any remaining sense of community and instill in the people deep feelings of fear and distrust, of hopelessness and despair, of isolation and powerlessness. And the results have been, it should be stated, rather spectacular.</p>

<p>With each school shooting, and each act of &#39;domestic terrorism,&#39; the social fabric of the country is ripped further asunder. The social contracts that bound us together as a people with common goals, common dreams, and common aspirations have been shattered. We have been reduced to a nation of frightened and disempowered individuals, each existing in our own little sphere of isolation and fear.</p>

<p>And at the same time, we have been desensitized to ever rising levels of violence in society. This is true of both interpersonal violence as well as violence by the state, in the form of judicial executions, spiraling levels of police violence, and the increased militarization of foreign policy and of America&#39;s borders.</p>

<p>We have become, in the words of the late George Orwell, a society in which &quot;the prevailing mental condition [is] controlled insanity.&quot; And under these conditions, it becomes increasingly difficult for the American people to fight back against the supreme injustice of 21st century Western society. Which is, of course, precisely the point.</p>

<p>For a fractured and disillusioned people, unable to find common cause, do not represent a threat to the rapidly encroaching system of global fascism. And a population blinded by fear will ultimately turn to &#39;Big Brother&#39; to protect them from nonexistent and/or wholly manufactured threats.</p>

<p>As General McArthur stated back in 1957: &quot;Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear ... with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it....&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps this is all just groundless conspiracy theorizing. The possibility does exist that the carnage at Columbine High School unfolded exactly as the official report tells us that it did. And even if that proves not to be the case, there really is no need to worry. It is all just a grand illusion, a choreographed reality. Only the death and suffering are real. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>During his trial, Vincenzo Vinciguerra, one of the fascist terrorists involved in the CIA and NATO <em>&quot;stay-behind armies&quot;</em>, testified that the real motive behind the shootings and bombings these networks carried out as part of <strong>Operation Gladio</strong> <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Vincenzo_Vinciguerra">was as such</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When you were on the Right you were not supposed to attack the State or its representatives. You were supposed to attack civilians, women, children, innocent people from outside the political arena. For one simple reason: To force the Italian public to turn to the State turn to the regime and ask for greater security. This was precisely the role of the right in Italy. It placed itself at the service of the State which created a strategy aptly called the &quot;Strategy of Tension&quot; in so far as they had to get ordinary people to accept that at any moment over a period of 30 years, from 1960 to the mid eighties a State of emergency could be declared. So, people would willingly trade part of their freedom for the security of being able to walk the streets, go on trains or enter a bank. This is the political logic behind all the bombings. They remain unpunished because the state cannot condemn itself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2000, an Italian parliamentary commission <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Operation_Gladio#The_Strategy_of_Tension">concluded</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Those massacres, those bombs, those military actions had been organised or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions and, as has been discovered more recently, by men linked to the structures of United States intelligence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David <em>&quot;Son of Sam&quot;</em> Berkowitz, describing the motives of the cult that he perpetrated the killings with, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our goal was to create an atmosphere where there&#39;s lawlessness and disorder everywhere.&quot;*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eric Harris <a href="http://fullspate.digitalcounterrevolution.co.uk/archive/columbine.html">wrote in April 1998:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sometime in April [1999] me and V will get revenge and will kick natural selection up a few notches. If we have figured out the art of time bombs beforehand, we will set hundreds of them around houses, roads, bridges, buildings and gas stations, anything that will cause damage and chaos...It&#39;ll be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, WWII, Vietnam, Duke [Nukem] and Doom all mixed together...I want to leave a lasting impression on the world.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to inform everyone here that there are many others who attended Columbine High School who do not feel this way. </p>

<p>Among them are survivors of the massacre like the Shoels family, the Taylor family and Chris Wisher, who actually saw other suspects and described how they and other students were pressured by police investigators to change their stories. Mark&#39;s mother, Donna, has made very interesting statements <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine-DonnaTaylor.html">about strange, disturbing aspects of this event.</a></p>

<p>Evan Long, who made <em>The Columbine Cause</em>, contacted several survivors. One, who refused to allow their name to be published, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120117212603/http://evanlong.net/columbine-shooting-witnesses-speak-out/">made the following comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a hard time watching your entire video. I watched 5 min. I saw too much that day, plain and simple. I have been told I could and would easily disappear if I tried to expose what happened that day. </p>

<p>I was locked inside that building [for hours] with the teacher [Dave Sanders] that died, risked my life to save him and he still died. I lost [...] friends [...] and had many friends seriously injured. [...] I was O. C. D. trying to save myself from death at [such a young age]. </p>

<p>I was also told by the police and investigators that I [...] was the most credible witness that day: However, I did not see [...] this and [...] that! [...] Everything I said happened in those 4 hours, the police have evidence of happening within 2 minutes of when I say it happened. They only denied my credibility after celebrating my accounts as true and belittling me and my mother to our faces! </p>

<p>My mom taught me to “Pay attention to time, location, and description.” She taught me that it pays to pay attention. This time it didn’t pay it cost me. I am a potential threat to those guilty and still living. They cannot make up their minds of what is right and wrong, they’ve been sucked into to the evil [...]. </p>

<p>I want to write a book, and have since it happened, but know too many reasons not to [publish it], like my family saying it risks my life. It still plagues me that my friends were forced to leave me while those sickened minds who killed them still walk [among] us. </p>

<p>I want peace without being a martyr! I love and so I am lovable! What makes that so hard?!!! My protectors betrayed me, deeply. Would die for the truth, but want to live for the beauty of my lost friends memory and most important power of LOVE!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of the survivors contacted by Long would agree to go on record.</p>

<p>Another student, Makai Hall, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9904/23/victim.released/">made a cryptic comment three days after the massacre:</a>: <strong>&#39;People have asked me not to discuss some things. And some things I don&#39;t feel people should know,&#39;</strong></p>

<p>Similarly, another student contacted by a researcher replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do raise a good argument and if you speak the truth of your experiences with such cases then I cannot argue with you in a structured or competitive manner. I can say that your experience in other cases have caused you to be a dainty, truth seeking individual. </p>

<p>I will tell you that us students haven&#39;t shared a lot of things. Things we intend on keeping to ourselves. Things we don&#39;t want the entire population to know. Want to know why? Because we don&#39;t care what the &quot;outsiders&quot; in the community think. If you don&#39;t go to CHS as a student or teacher, you may contemplate and assume all you want without worrying about getting a negative smirk from me. </p>

<p>Thank you for the invitation to your gathering, but I have already given out enough information about the victims, details about the tragedy, Dylan and Eric, and all sorts of other things. I also do not wish to hear what a bunch of retired police officers and army personnel think about the shooting. Unless, of course, they went to CHESS.</p>

<p>Do you share the viewpoint of these students that many secrets surrounding this attack should stay secret? Did Columbine High School house some kind of dark experiment?</p>

<p>By the way, there is a wealth of evidence in the files showing that the Trench Coat Mafia practiced Satanism:</p>

<p>1) TCMer Eric Dutro walking around the school cafeteria telling people that &quot;Satan loves you&quot;(Kelly Beer, 6106) in the spring of &#39;98.</p>

<p>2) Courtney van Dell, aka &#39;devil girl,&#39; wore barettes in her hair to make it look like she had horns. Said to be a &#39;wikken&#39;(sic) or a devil worshipper(Kristi Mohrbacher(1010), Jessica Lucero(1508 ), Leigh Ann Clark(2723)).</p>

<p>3) The students seeking shelter with Clement Park worker Steve Ogle(1056) told him the perpetrators were TCM and were &quot;satanists&quot;.</p>

<p>4) Jecoa Catt(1364) told IO that the TCM were satanic.</p>

<p>5) Jason Jones(1474) observed the TCM playing &#39;magic&#39; cards in the cafeteria, which were about the devil and about power.</p>

<p>6) Lacey Shotts(1651) said she believed the TCM students were &#39;devil worshippers.&#39;</p>

<p>7) Jen Smull saw Robert Perry at a halloween party dressed as a worlock(1827).</p>

<p>8 ) Student Perlman(4054) said Joe Stair used to come to woodshop class with a book he called &#39;the devil&#39;s bible&#39;.</p>

<p>9) Prior to 4th hour on 4-20, Nicole Ray(4144) saw a male TCMer in the science hall, with his hair fashioned ino devil&#39;s horns.</p>

Dustin said that (Redacted) was very verbal about his desire to kill people.&quot;</p>

<p>Student Jonathan Vandermark - who also saw three bodies in a stairwell when no one was officially killed there, one of many who described &#39;unofficial&#39; casualties in the school - <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/columbine2.htm">described the Trench Coat Mafia NBC</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They like to say they are bi-sexual, and are proud of it. They practice Satanic rituals, I believe, and walk around the school in black clothing, usually in a trench coat. They&#39;re clearly a gang. They don&#39;t move for people in the hall. They&#39;re not courteous to anybody. They&#39;ll bump you in the shoulder or something like that...they&#39;ll turn around and just give you a stare like they don&#39;t care, and what can you do to them? Kind of like they&#39;re above everybody.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>David G. Penland, a certified private investigator in Littleton, <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/columbine2.htm">related to researchers</a> an incident that took place on April 21, 1999:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While on patrol in area of a local homeowner association, I received an emergency call from a resident of another homeowner association. The resident said that he was afraid of what was going on next door in a town-house next to him. He said there were several teens next door having a party and celebrating Adolf Hitler&#39;s birthday and the &#39;victory&#39; of Klebold and Harris in the Columbine massacre of students. </p>

<p>They were yelling and screaming &quot;Hail Hitler&quot; over and over, and playing a game of some type. I was the first to respond to this call and I met with the frantic resident. I got him quieted down and waited for the teens who had left. I waited in my patrol car for them to return, and otherwise it was quiet in the neighborhood. </p>

<p>Soon they returned and I confronted them about the noise complaint. They denied it, and said they were not home at all. I filed a report with my security office and contacted an Aurora police officer on patrol and spoke to him about the incident. He followed up the next day and contacted the youth and his father. </p>

<p>The officer contacted me and shared the results of his investigation. He said the father jumped all over him and the kid went ballistic. We know as a security firm that we have past reports on this youth being involved in Neo-Nazi activities. This he does not deny and he is proud of being part of this large group. He also has been arrested for other disturbances, and for selling and using drugs often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the researchers, Penland also related the following information:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Penland could not say whether or not the teenagers involved in the incident had any direct relation to the Columbine shooting. He noted that he has seen &quot;trench coated figures&quot; in the Aurora area before. Penland also related to us a number of crimes in the Denver area which indicate a Satanist or Neo-Nazi faction the responsible party. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Harris and Klebold were not part of the &quot;Trench Coat Mafia.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed they were, although members of the group did their best to distance themselves from them afterward. At the very least it can be said that they were affiliated with the group, and by all outward appearances up until the day of the massacre they were members. Furthermore, founding member Patrick McDuffee identified them as members to investigators on the night of the massacre. (10783) </p>

<p>Both were identified by scores of students as members of the Trench Coat Mafia, and they were closely associated with <em>many</em> members of the group - not simply a couple. Both worked at Black Jack Pizza alongside other members. Both constantly wore trench coats and did so on the date of the assault. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were friends with a couple of people who were</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nate Dykeman, Robert Perry, Brian Sargent, and Chris Morris, among others. Sargent was identified as a gunman to investigators by student Cara Sander, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZyklp6GHK8">her mother had called KUSA</a> on the date of the massacre to convey her daughter&#39;s description of the assailant. It cannot, then, later be claimed that her memories were later <em>&quot;tainted&quot;</em> by investigators.</p>

<p>She said: <em>&quot;She looked up and saw a gunman in a black trench coat with a very huge gun in front of him.... He had dark brown hair, thick, bushy eyebrows and was very ugly. She said he was a white male. ...&quot;</em></p>

<p>Sander did not recognize the suspect as a student. She later identified Sargent from a photo lineup. He had thick, bushy eyebrows, a round face and was notably the only member of the Trench Coat Mafia who was visibly shorter than the others. On the date of the massacre, he had a mustache and was seen earlier in the day wearing blue jeans and a white polo shirt.</p>

<p><a href="http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/932/The-Case-Against-Brian-Sargent-by-starviego">Many other witnesses</a> saw an attacker who matched this description. Sargent, who was said to seclude himself from everyone else, was known to associate with Harris and Klebold. Peter Horvath, the school disciplinarian, tells investigators this (5708) and so do two different students: Kimberly Carlin, who said the three were <em>&quot;good friends&quot;</em> (5239), and Ryan Pool, who said Harris, Klebold, Sargent and Perry hung around together a lot (4097). When asked by investigators, Sargent said that he <em>&quot;doesn&#39;t know [Klebold] personally.&quot;</em> (8785)</p>

<p>See how it&#39;s difficult to gauge the reliability of the Trench Coat Mafia on this point? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it was just a bunch of dumb kids who wanted to be ~provocative~ and thought they looked bad-ass in dusters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Alex Marsh and Patrick McDuffee, one of the founding members, were actually members of the group until they left because of its plans to carry out violent acts. Both exhibited knowledge of the plan for the massacre and clearly believed multiple people were involved. </p>

<p>McDuffee gave a detailed outline of the conspiracy to investigators, naming Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, Robert Perry, Joe Stair and Chris Morris as shooters, and Charles Phillips, John Beachum and Eric Dutro along with other unknown parties as being involved in parts of the operation such as planning and construction of explosives.</p>

<p>McDuffee indicated that the group was stockpiling guns and bombs, and frequently conducting &quot;war game&quot; exercises. They would meet in the woods and speak German, and study World War II. There is much evidence in the documentary record to suggest that the group was deeply interested in fascism, and that they practiced satanism is seemingly undeniable. There are scores of references to satanic activity in the police files, and in fact victims Cassie Bernall, whose mother worked in the legal department of Lockheed Martin, and Rachel Scott were involved with such groups before the massacre.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the Supplementary Reports there is an unnamed individual who attends another high school in the Denver area. He related that he had been to parties attended by many &#39;goths&#39; and members of the Trench Coat Mafia who were in their twenties, who lived across the area, and who were largely graduates. They were into cutting, bloodletting and violence. Explicit homosexual photos were found in this source&#39;s backpack and, when questioned, he indicated that he had received them at the home of a man involved in this circuit who is known as <em>&quot;Pedophile Bill&quot;</em> - a local homosexual who was <em>&quot;not nice sexually&quot;</em> and who possessed a number of graphic images of child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>My point is that the Trench Coat Mafia was part of something much larger. Why do you think <a href="http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/375/Ring-Around-Columbine">teenagers in trench coats all initiated attacks</a> on schools at around this time - many of them <strong><em>before</em></strong> the massacre or that had been planning before the massacre? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many shots WERE fired in the school after Harris and Klebold were dead; they were fired by the SWAT teams who were systematically sweeping the school for hours and shooting their way through locked doors. </p>

<p>The cops tried for ages to nail him and others for being involved in the conspiracy and couldn&#39;t come up with anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they did not. They questioned him for several hours and then released him. His room was searched and yet we are told nothing of interest was found, despite the fact that he boasted regularly of constructing explosives. </p>

<p>They turned him into an intelligence asset and then used him to set up Mark Manes and Philip Duran as the men who provided the weapons for the assault. It was actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524060333/http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/839/t/Where-did-they-get-the-Guns-By-Starviego.html">much more complicated than that.</a></p>

<p>His own family suspected his involvement and even kicked him out after the massacre. Two independent eyewitnesses identified him as a shooter, one of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHefZGoJz24">that day.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he was a shooter, how did he get away from the school? And then after he made his escape through the hundreds and hundreds of cops in a perimeter around the school, why would he call 911 and offer himself up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two ways to look at this from my perspective: </p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> Chris Morris was well aware that the local, state and federal law enforcement agencies involved in the <em>&quot;investigation&quot;</em> had no interest in the truth behind the massacre and were not interested in pursuing the other suspects.</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> Morris - who was attending <em>&quot;anger management classes&quot;</em> before the attack - and the others involved were <em>&quot;manchurian candidate&quot;</em> like Harris and Klebold. </p>

<p>I suspect the latter. The Trench Coat Mafia was - in my view - a part of a wide network of satanic groups that were sponsored by the U.S. intelligence services as a cover for continuing mind control projects on U.S. soil and to commit acts of horrific violence in order to create fear in our communities.</p>

<p>He once told classmate Mark Hengel that he followed Satan&#39;s Commandments and: <em>&quot;We are all part of a big computer game and someone else controls our lives.&quot;</em> (5899) Another classmate, Kristen Long, said that Morris, Harris, Klebold and Nathan Dykeman, another suspect, would regularly speak about bombs, firearms and killing people. (5027) She said they were not specific about their target but that they were <em>&quot;obsessed with it&quot;</em> and would regularly refer to <em>&quot;playing the game.&quot;</em> Remember how McDuffee described their <em>&quot;war games&quot;</em>? Many of the survivors said that the gunman were acting as if they were playing a game. </p>

<p>Clint Woodman, a classmate who had seen him in third period, said he seemed completely normal. Crystal Braggazi said that he was in Clement Park at around 12:15 and was hurriedly trying to reach the school. He was actually described as <em>&quot;angry&quot;</em> that the police wouldn&#39;t let him through. (5225) </p>

<p>Similarly, Robert Perry was described as <em>&quot;really angry&quot;</em> at the shooters by both students Andrea Cook (5188) and Matt Reicks (5634), one of them mentioning that he was upset his sister Lydie was jeopardized. On the other hand, Jo-Lee Gallegos <em>&quot;heard Lydie say that a friend had called her the night before and told her to stay away from the school on the 20th because something big was going to happen.&quot;</em> (5424)</p>

<p>Sargent, too, was allegedly upset - although this information was only offered by Thaddeus Boles, a member of the Trench Coat Mafia. He said: <em>&quot;[Brian] Sargent was in a panic because he could not find a friend of his.&quot;</em> (10656)</p>

<p>What are we to make of these reports? Are they evidence that these men, who were identified as gunmen, were not in fact involved? Were they play-acting?</p>

<p>I think the truth is that they were programmed. Witnesses saw a man who looked to be in his mid-twenties with a group of trench-coated students outside of the school before the massacre began. Witnesses in the science hall saw Klebold with a gunman who looked like he was <strong><em>in his thirties</em></strong> - how can &#39;confusion,&#39; &#39;fear&#39; or changes in clothing account for <strong><em>that</em></strong>?</p>

<p>There were adults on scene - likely, as independent journalist John Quin postulated, <a href="http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/quinn_colorado.html">&quot;senior control agents.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Morris was quite publicly arrested that day when he came forward as one of Harris and Klebold&#39;s friends, which would have planted the idea that he was involved in the minds of a lot of kids.</p>

<p>All of the witness statements that mention Morris cited in the video were taken long after the actual event, when all the witnesses memories (which are notoriously unreliable anyway) would have been tainted by all the media coverage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris Wisher had identified him as <em>&quot;one of the ones that shot at us&quot;</em> that very day, and Ashley Eglund specifically identified him as one of the gunmen, describing features that were inconsistent with Harris and Klebold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Students said ALL KINDS of patently false things to investigators and the media after hearing them from other sources. It became a ridiculous echo chamber of rumors and nonsense. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where is the evidence of this? It seems as if these accounts from people who were actually there simply become <em>&quot;patently false&quot;</em> when they do not conform to the official narrative of the attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supposed sightings of multiple gunmen are pretty easily explained by a) the chaos of the event and the general unreliability of witnesses perceptions and recollections,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope - and for three reasons:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> Many of the accounts are <em>very consistent</em> on certain points with regard to the descriptions (and sometimes identities) of these suspects. <em>&quot;Confusion&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;fear&quot;</em> become less and less likely with corroboration.</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> Many witnesses saw suspects with guns or duffel bags <em>before the beginning of the shooting.</em> In some cases, they heard plans for the attack being discussed days, weeks and even months before. Melissa Chavez, for example, said that she met Harris and Klebold with four other males at a local mall, and they showed her a map of where they would bomb the school. (9023)</p>

<p><strong>c)</strong> Many of the witnesses never wavered from their accounts, and were instead suspicious of the seeming narrow focus of law enforcement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>b) the wardrobe changes Harris and Klebold went through,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless they could also morph their height, hairstyle and hair colour, age, facial structure and complexion, among many other things, then this argument is also insufficient to explain these accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>c) misidentification, like the reports of the A/C repairman on the roof being a third shooter,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remain unconvinced that this was <em>&quot;misidentification.&quot;</em> The evidence surrounding this issue is, like many aspects of this case, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524043731/http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/838/t/The-Guy-s-on-the-Roof.html">highly complex.</a> </p>

<p>Firstly, students clearly described the man on the roof as aiming a gun or <em>&quot;a long black object.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>Secondly, <em>the police on scene</em> - all trained observers - told students there was a shooter on the roof. </p>

<p>Thirdly, some witnesses indicated that there was more than one person on the roof that day. Karen Drinnon and her boss, Mike Valerio, believed they observed two parties on the roof through a telphoto lens - one wore a white t-shirt and the other a white shirt <em>with a red stripe.</em> </p>

<p>Drinnon and Valerio were recording this, and submitted their tape to investigators. It has never been released, and, according to Donna Taylor, whose son was among those shot at the school, <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine/ShooterOnRoof.mp3">said</a>: <em>&quot;They had a videotape [of the roof shooter], but they threw that in the trash.&quot;</em> She mentioned that she herself had once possessed a copy, but that it had mysteriously gone missing. </p>

<p>The Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/Sniper.htm">later released</a> a photo showing what appeared to be a suspect on the rooftop with a red stripe on their shoulder. </p>

<p>Little to nothing is known about Chris Clarke, the <em>&#39;maintenance man.&#39;</em> He was wearing a red, white and blue striped shirt, which might lead us to believe that he was one of the men seen and video-taped by Drinnon and Valerio, as well as the man in the photo released by the JCSO. Of course, the problem here is that Clarke has always claimed he was alone on the roof that day.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t even clear why Clarke was at Columbine High that day. He later told investigators that he was there to repair a leak above the girl&#39;s locker room on the northwest edge of the building. (745) In his first interview, however, he had said that he was <em>inside the school</em> when the shooting began and fled up to the custodian&#39;s roof access. One of the <em>&quot;county maintenance guys&quot;</em> reportedly told teacher Brandi Ann Hirokawa that he was there to repair the dark room fan above her photography class <em>on the eastern side of the school.</em> </p>

<p>One thing I found very interesting is that Clarke stated that <em>&quot;a uniformed police officer pulled a van alongside the school and helped him off the roof.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>Denver Police Officer Wayne DePew - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110816122131/http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/521#.VtIlyUCAZFY">whose son Matt</a> was potentially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110816054909/http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/941/t/Jeremy-and-Brett-and-the-trouble-with-SWAT-by-starviego.html#.VtImXUCAZFZ">a key witness to very strange activity inside the school</a> and who <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_23493032/columbine-survivor-depew-dies-working-power-lines-new">was later killed in an &#39;accident&#39; just short of the summer solstice</a> - had commandeered Clarke&#39;s service van, with the keys conveniently left in the ignition. Why did no other police officer see this &#39;rescue&#39; take place, including those DePew said he was with? And <strong><em>why didn&#39;t Clarke recognize his own service van?</em></strong> </p>

<p>Taylor, interestingly enough, has reportedly claimed that Clarke was the man <a href="http://www.columbineconspiracy.net/roofsus.html">who originally turned Mark Manes into the police.</a> This would of course raise questions about his ties to the suspects. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think <em>&quot;Chris Clarke&quot;</em> was the only one on the roof that day. I also suspect he was not a <em>&quot;maintenance man&quot;</em> at all and that we probably don&#39;t know his real name.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>d) the sound of explosions from pipe bombs or gunfire from SWAT creating the impression that there were shooters in many more areas than there actually were. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are acknowledging that there were SWAT personnel inside the school at the same time as the gunmen, you are agreeing with earlier reports by local law enforcement agencies. Why, then, do they refuse to admit the presence of officers in the school before 1:00? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harris and Klebold both extensively documented their plans for the attack for a year in both their journals and recordings. They never said a word about anyone else being involved;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, we don&#39;t know this - the tapes were never released, and all copies <a href="http://www.westword.com/news/columbine-killers-basement-tapes-destroyed-6283043">have reportedly been destroyed by police.</a> The diaries were not released in full either, but the films and writings that have been show many others involved in their activities - including Zack Heckler, who was suspected of shooting out a rival student&#39;s windows not long before the massacre. Heckler accompanied Harris and Klebold on a number of late night <em>&quot;missions&quot;</em> that usually involved vandalism.</p>

<p>Furthermore, why do you think they would have incriminated their friends?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s just no compelling evidence of there being any other shooters that day. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a wealth of evidence that there were many persons involved in both the planning and execution of the massacre, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524061822/http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/842/t/Who-had-Foreknowledge-starviego.html">many, many more had foreknowledge.</a> Half the school <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine/HalfOfStudentsDidntShowUp.mp3">was absent that day.</a></p>

<p>The massacre at Columbine High and many of the horrific tragedies that have followed it were choreographed in the same way that scores of shootings and bombings were by CIA and NATO as part of <strong>Operation Gladio.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also want to address your claim that Chris Morris <em>&quot;was not even at the school &quot;</em> at the beginning of the shooting. Chris Wisher and Ashley Eglund certainly disagreed. </p>

<p>In fact, Morris&#39; only alibi witness for that day was <strong>Cory Friesen</strong>, his <strong><em>best friend</em></strong> and a member of the Trench Coat Mafia. From <em>The Columbine Cause</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friesen, a co-founder of the CHS TCM, is the son of CHS chemistry teacher, Kent Friesen, who showed his students how to make a potato launcher type of weapon by using explosive chemicals. Morris added to his lab partner during the lesson that it would be easy to convert the device into a pipe bomb with just a few adjustments.</p>

<p>In 2004, there was a <a href="http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/1150/acid-spillColumbine">highly suspicious explosion</a> in Friesen&#39;s class. He was known for making things go <strong><em>&quot;boom&quot;</em></strong> and a few students initially thought the sounds of shooting and explosions were yet another one of his class experiments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question you need to ask is...why when the eye witnesses reported seeing other multiple shooters...did the authorities and media bury it all, like it never happened?</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see how &#39;designed&#39; your media reality is...you&#39;re spoon fed corporate monopoly information...and if that is your only diet, you&#39;ll never have a clue as to what is really going on.</p>

<p>Similar stuff happened with the McVeigh Oklahoma bombing, dozens reported seeing bombs inside the office building (unexploded and in-situ), yet this was all buried and the public were left believing that a truck fertilizer bomb did it all! </p>

<p>I know because I saw one of the very earliest news reports that stated that there were bombs inside...that went down Orwell&#39;s memory hole, like most of this stuff.  Move along, nothing to see here.</p>

<p>I think a bigger question is why are there shootings near Air Force bases?  There are four or five airforce bases in Denver.</p>

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if their parents are connected to the intelligence community.</p>

<p>Trench Coat Mafia...was a link to The Matrix film (in my mind), and Klebold was born on Sept 11...Neo&#39;s Matrix passport expired on Sept 11 2001. The event also took place on April 20th, Hitler&#39;s birth date and one or both of them had an interest in Nazism and its paraphernalia.</p>

<p>The FBI&#39;s lead investigator on the Columbine shooting happen to have a son going to Columbine that co-produced a video two years before the shooting that &quot;depicts gun-toting, trench coat-wearing students moving through Columbine&#39;s halls and ends with a special-effects explosion of the school.&quot; Yet this wasn&#39;t seen as a conflict of interest somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being someone with family who was at the school during this incident, I can&#39;t agree more. This is just empty fishing, and false unfounded &quot;facts&quot; . Klebold and Harris may have set a precedent for the government, but they weren&#39;t a part of a satanic cult, I mean they were teenagers.. Why is it always a satanic cult with these people. The world is not Jesus versus Satan.. It&#39;s barely good versus evil, and if your definition of good is Jesus then you may be missing out on the big picture, or the original prime conspiracy/lie. Anyways, Klebold and Harris acted alone, the evidence pointing to them acting soleley is astounding. From my cousin, they were always outcasts, picked on a lot, and always seemed to be hard to connect with. This is your typical mass murderer/psychopath definition. &#39;Satanic cult&#39;, are you serious? Get a life Jesus freaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Harris and Klebold were not part of the &quot;Trench Coat Mafia.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed they were, although members of the group did their best to distance themselves from them afterward. At the very least it can be said that they were affiliated with the group, and by all outward appearances up until the day of the massacre they were members. Furthermore, founding member Patrick McDuffee identified them as members to investigators on the night of the massacre. (10783) </p>

<p>Both were identified by scores of students as members of the Trench Coat Mafia, and they were closely associated with <em>many</em> members of the group - not simply a couple. Both worked at Black Jack Pizza alongside other members. Both constantly wore trench coats and did so on the date of the assault. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were friends with a couple of people who were</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nate Dykeman, Robert Perry, Brian Sargent, and Chris Morris, among others. Sargent was identified as a gunman to investigators by student Cara Sander, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZyklp6GHK8">her mother had called KUSA</a> on the date of the massacre to convey her daughter&#39;s description of the assailant. It cannot, then, later be claimed that her memories were later <em>&quot;tainted&quot;</em> by investigators.</p>

<p>She said: <em>&quot;She looked up and saw a gunman in a black trench coat with a very huge gun in front of him.... He had dark brown hair, thick, bushy eyebrows and was very ugly. She said he was a white male. ...&quot;</em></p>

<p>Sander did not recognize the suspect as a student. She later identified Sargent from a photo lineup. He had thick, bushy eyebrows, a round face and was notably the only member of the Trench Coat Mafia who was visibly shorter than the others. On the date of the massacre, he had a mustache and was seen earlier in the day wearing blue jeans and a white polo shirt.</p>

<p><a href="http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/932/The-Case-Against-Brian-Sargent-by-starviego">Many other witnesses</a> saw an attacker who matched this description. Sargent, who was said to seclude himself from everyone else, was known to associate with Harris and Klebold. Peter Horvath, the school disciplinarian, tells investigators this (5708) and so do two different students: Kimberly Carlin, who said the three were <em>&quot;good friends&quot;</em> (5239), and Ryan Pool, who said Harris, Klebold, Sargent and Perry hung around together a lot (4097). When asked by investigators, Sargent said that he <em>&quot;doesn&#39;t know [Klebold] personally.&quot;</em> (8785)</p>

<p>See how it&#39;s difficult to gauge the reliability of the Trench Coat Mafia on this point? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it was just a bunch of dumb kids who wanted to be ~provocative~ and thought they looked bad-ass in dusters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Alex Marsh and Patrick McDuffee, one of the founding members, were actually members of the group until they left because of its plans to carry out violent acts. Both exhibited knowledge of the plan for the massacre and clearly believed multiple people were involved. </p>

<p>McDuffee gave a detailed outline of the conspiracy to investigators, naming Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, Robert Perry, Joe Stair and Chris Morris as shooters, and Charles Phillips, John Beachum and Eric Dutro along with other unknown parties as being involved in parts of the operation such as planning and construction of explosives.</p>

<p>McDuffee indicated that the group was stockpiling guns and bombs, and frequently conducting &quot;war game&quot; exercises. They would meet in the woods and speak German, and study World War II. There is much evidence in the documentary record to suggest that the group was deeply interested in fascism, and that they practiced satanism is seemingly undeniable. There are scores of references to satanic activity in the police files, and in fact victims Cassie Bernall, whose mother worked in the legal department of Lockheed Martin, and Rachel Scott were involved with such groups before the massacre.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the Supplementary Reports there is an unnamed individual who attends another high school in the Denver area. He related that he had been to parties attended by many &#39;goths&#39; and members of the Trench Coat Mafia who were in their twenties, who lived across the area, and who were largely graduates. They were into cutting, bloodletting and violence. Explicit homosexual photos were found in this source&#39;s backpack and, when questioned, he indicated that he had received them at the home of a man involved in this circuit who is known as <em>&quot;Pedophile Bill&quot;</em> - a local homosexual who was <em>&quot;not nice sexually&quot;</em> and who possessed a number of graphic images of child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>My point is that the Trench Coat Mafia was part of something much larger. Why do you think <a href="http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/375/Ring-Around-Columbine">teenagers in trench coats all initiated attacks</a> on schools at around this time - many of them <strong><em>before</em></strong> the massacre or that had been planning before the massacre? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many shots WERE fired in the school after Harris and Klebold were dead; they were fired by the SWAT teams who were systematically sweeping the school for hours and shooting their way through locked doors. </p>

<p>The cops tried for ages to nail him and others for being involved in the conspiracy and couldn&#39;t come up with anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they did not. They questioned him for several hours and then released him. His room was searched and yet we are told nothing of interest was found, despite the fact that he boasted regularly of constructing explosives. </p>

<p>They turned him into an intelligence asset and then used him to set up Mark Manes and Philip Duran as the men who provided the weapons for the assault. It was actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524060333/http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/839/t/Where-did-they-get-the-Guns-By-Starviego.html">much more complicated than that.</a></p>

<p>His own family suspected his involvement and even kicked him out after the massacre. Two independent eyewitnesses identified him as a shooter, one of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHefZGoJz24">that day.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he was a shooter, how did he get away from the school? And then after he made his escape through the hundreds and hundreds of cops in a perimeter around the school, why would he call 911 and offer himself up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two ways to look at this from my perspective: </p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> Chris Morris was well aware that the local, state and federal law enforcement agencies involved in the <em>&quot;investigation&quot;</em> had no interest in the truth behind the massacre and were not interested in pursuing the other suspects.</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> Morris - who was attending <em>&quot;anger management classes&quot;</em> before the attack - and the others involved were <em>&quot;manchurian candidate&quot;</em> like Harris and Klebold. </p>

<p>I suspect the latter. The Trench Coat Mafia was - in my view - a part of a wide network of satanic groups that were sponsored by the U.S. intelligence services as a cover for continuing mind control projects on U.S. soil and to commit acts of horrific violence in order to create fear in our communities.</p>

<p>He once told classmate Mark Hengel that he followed Satan&#39;s Commandments and: <em>&quot;We are all part of a big computer game and someone else controls our lives.&quot;</em> (5899) Another classmate, Kristen Long, said that Morris, Harris, Klebold and Nathan Dykeman, another suspect, would regularly speak about bombs, firearms and killing people. (5027) She said they were not specific about their target but that they were <em>&quot;obsessed with it&quot;</em> and would regularly refer to <em>&quot;playing the game.&quot;</em> Remember how McDuffee described their <em>&quot;war games&quot;</em>? Many of the survivors said that the gunman were acting as if they were playing a game. </p>

<p>Clint Woodman, a classmate who had seen him in third period, said he seemed completely normal. Crystal Braggazi said that he was in Clement Park at around 12:15 and was hurriedly trying to reach the school. He was actually described as <em>&quot;angry&quot;</em> that the police wouldn&#39;t let him through. (5225) </p>

<p>Similarly, Robert Perry was described as <em>&quot;really angry&quot;</em> at the shooters by both students Andrea Cook (5188) and Matt Reicks (5634), one of them mentioning that he was upset his sister Lydie was jeopardized. On the other hand, Jo-Lee Gallegos <em>&quot;heard Lydie say that a friend had called her the night before and told her to stay away from the school on the 20th because something big was going to happen.&quot;</em> (5424)</p>

<p>Sargent, too, was allegedly upset - although this information was only offered by Thaddeus Boles, a member of the Trench Coat Mafia. He said: <em>&quot;[Brian] Sargent was in a panic because he could not find a friend of his.&quot;</em> (10656)</p>

<p>What are we to make of these reports? Are they evidence that these men, who were identified as gunmen, were not in fact involved? Were they play-acting?</p>

<p>I think the truth is that they were programmed. Witnesses saw a man who looked to be in his mid-twenties with a group of trench-coated students outside of the school before the massacre began. Witnesses in the science hall saw Klebold with a gunman who looked like he was <strong><em>in his thirties</em></strong> - how can &#39;confusion,&#39; &#39;fear&#39; or changes in clothing account for <strong><em>that</em></strong>?</p>

<p>There were adults on scene - likely, as independent journalist John Quin postulated, <a href="http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/quinn_colorado.html">&quot;senior control agents.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also want to address your claim that Chris Morris <em>&quot;was not even at the school &quot;</em> at the beginning of the shooting. Chris Wisher and Ashley Eglund certainly disagreed. </p>

<p>In fact, Morris&#39; only alibi witness for that day was <strong>Cory Friesen</strong>, his <strong><em>best friend</em></strong> and a member of the Trench Coat Mafia. From <em>The Columbine Cause</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friesen, a co-founder of the CHS TCM, is the son of CHS chemistry teacher, Kent Friesen, who showed his students how to make a potato launcher type of weapon by using explosive chemicals. Morris added to his lab partner during the lesson that it would be easy to convert the device into a pipe bomb with just a few adjustments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2004, there was a <a href="http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/1150/acid-spillColumbine">highly suspicious explosion</a> in Friesen&#39;s class. He was known for making things go <strong><em>&quot;boom&quot;</em></strong> and a few students initially thought the sounds of shooting and explosions were yet another one of his class experiments.</p>
