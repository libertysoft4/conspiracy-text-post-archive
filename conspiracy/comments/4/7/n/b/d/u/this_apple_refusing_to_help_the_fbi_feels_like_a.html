    <div class="md"><p>The way more likely &quot;conspiracy&quot; is that they have no problem cracking into this phone but are using this as a way to get a backdoor anyways, they just waited for the &quot;perfect case&quot; to push for it and a &quot;Terrorist mass shooting&quot; was the perfect one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. After the Paris attacks John Miller (NYPD counter-terrorism) went on TV and said this happened because of encryption and Edward Snowden. Then it came out that the Paris guys didn&#39;t even use encryption to plan attacks. They used regular SMS. We didn&#39;t hear about this again until San Bernadino, then the same anti-encryption message came out again. It&#39;s obvious that this has nothing to do with getting into this one phone and is really about getting into all phones whenever they want without public scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I almost never seen brought up is that if it is just a pin code protecting the phone, it is trivial to crack.</p>

<p>People cite that each time they get the password wrong the time to try again increases. Unless Apple fixed it <strong>this does not apply if the phone is power cycled after each try</strong>. Power cycling the the phone after each try can be done in less than 3 days by a device for 4 digit passcodes, and could even be done by hand in about the same amount of time, with less work then this court case. </p>

<p>That is a maximum amount of time it would, if the very last attempt is the one that unlocks it, it would likely take a much shorter amount of time. If they used a 6 digit instead of a 4 digit code it would take significantly longer but still not an incredibly long amount of time.</p>

<p>“If they win, great for the FBI. They get a precedent going forward where they can demand a backdoor into essentially anything,” Cardozo told Yahoo News. “If they lose, maybe even better for the FBI, because they can go to Congress and say, ‘Look, the law didn’t allow us to do what we wanted to do in San Bernardino.’ Either outcome is great for the FBI.”  </p>

<p>Also great PR for Apple.  Little stunts like this distract you from the fact that they have been spying on you all along.  They also <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463">run a goddamn sweatshop in China</a> and have a long history of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/apple-uk-corporate-tax_n_3528372.html">tax evasion</a>, among other heinous acts.  </p>

<p>Also, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Olson">Theodore Olson</a> whom Apple just hired to be part of their legal team.  His wiki speaks for itself, don&#39;t forget to read all the way to the bottom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering how long until the situation is created where there is allegedly information on a locked phone that needs to be accessed to stop some kind of mass casualty event (chemical, nuclear, etc) and Apple sticks to the script, doesn&#39;t unlock the phone and thousands die.</p>

<p>The majority of people then decide that the right to privacy is too costly and what rights we still have are signed away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure there is always the worst case possible but is that likely?  There are two reasons this intrustion of the FBI is bs.</p>

<p>Ist is because by the time that phone is opened all connections have already moved into different spaces on the playing field.</p>

<p>2nd.  Whatever is on that phone can be obtained through other channels.  Each of us get a bill each month outlining who we called, their number etc.  The FBI is being lazy.</p>

<p>Are we really that scared of terror that we want every possibilty twarted?  Do we really expect a Utopia?   Don&#39;t we have enough agencys protecting us all now without turning completely our privacy?  Is one damn phone that important?  Wirth so many agencys aren&#39;t we protected enough?</p>

<p>Lets see...we have the CIA, FBI, NSA,  Homeland Security, State Patrols, City police, National Guards, Coast Guards, Department of Corrections, US Marshal s, Border Patrols, Immigration,  Port Security, Private Investigators, Private Security, Sheriff departments NCIS in the Navy, MPs in the Army, the complete Army, Airforce, Marines, Navy, and the presidential excutive office all protecting us from the evils of this world.  Is one phone considered the breaking point of an investagation or is there enough avenues one can take to come up with information by using other intelligence or methods?</p>

<p>I am sick and tired of all this protection and the additional power these agencys keep demanding from the public with the cover of doing their job better.  If these agencys cant keep us safe how many more do we need to do the job?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to compromise a phone to get at positional information.. the way cellular networks work lends itself to external trilateration.</p>

<p>The assertion that because GPS is used the phones can be hacked does not hold up to scrutiny. The presence of a GPS chip only makes location more precise for those with the ability to access the phone. So <em>if</em> there is a backdoor, it can report more accurate location information to an analyst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>iOS 8 was designed because Apple was tired of fielding requests from the NSA, Homeland Security, etc.</p>

<p>Apple plainly said that by fully encrypting everything <em>on the phone</em>, they couldn&#39;t be bothered to provide access as they would no longer have it.</p>

<p>Now of course, metadata is still available, and Apple works with the authorities to provide access to anything in iCloud when presented with a warrant.</p>

<p>The iPhone really does not have a backdoor. If it did, you would have heard about it by now (remember The Fappening - there are people out there who would like to break into people&#39;s phones, not just the government).</p>

<p>The issue where this becomes bullshit is the changing narrative. First we heard the FBI wanted a backdoor built in to iOS, then we hear they just want Apple to disable to the wipe-everything-if-you-put-the-wrong-passcode-10-times feature disabled. Now they apparently need access to a dozen phones...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t have access to the raw storage on the internal hard drive without using the passcode. The FBI produced 13 more phones that they want unlocked for this reason.</p>

<p>They have a brute force passcode cracker and this would be an easy way to break the passcode in as little as one day IF they knew the automatic wipe feature wasn&#39;t enabled. That is what they are asking Apple to remove.</p>

<p>What they do have are the internet logs, text messages and phone call logs which go thru a cell phone tower and data center somewhere. Of course they tap that, multiple agencies probably do. They ALSO had the iCloud backup that was done before <em>they themselves</em> demanded the county to reset the iCloud password.</p>

<p>Most importantly, nobody cares about the terrorists anymore. They are done, dead. IF this happened again tomorrow without an iPhone involved, then what?</p>

<p>There is something more going on than merely a PR stunt. FBI has been lying throughout this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I learned form this &quot;issue&quot; is that there is a chance that Apple might be able to circumvent their own security measured. This means it&#39;s technically possible to break into a fully encrypted iPhone (at least an iPhone 5c)</p>

<p>Apple aren&#39;t made of wizard. They probably don&#39;t have a lot more knowledge than other motivated actors can gather. And recreate. And reverse engineer.</p>

<p>All I heard is that despite all the claims of full encryption and security enclaves and other buzzwords, your iPhone is not secure. It is possible to retrieve the data without your consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s obviously a stunt. Anyone paying attention knows the feds already have all your info through other means that don&#39;t require encryption being hacked the way they&#39;re asking, because they have enough meta data to make the encryption irrelevant.</p>

<p>The joint scheme is to get people to think the encryption is safe and for them to let their guard down. Bringing uniformity to the market, to make the gov&#39;s hobby of watching everyone a more streamlined task, with increasingly uniform data spreads. This way they can automate the process of filtering data.</p>

<p>The only real hurdle the gov has left is organizing the data they have about you. Having different encryption makes that just a bit more inconvenient.</p>

<p>All the other industry leaders are going to jump in, you can see it starting now. Apple stands to profit greatly from this, it&#39;s free advertising obviously.</p>

<p>Basically, with the like bazillion terabyte hard drives the NSA has in the high deserts of the western US, essentially downloading the internet, in conjunction with meta data; it&#39;s just a process of elimination and filtering to find out who is who. Doing what, with entire history and evolving personality and habit profiles. Breaking encryption simply accelerates the process.</p>

<p>Chances are, the feds have broken the encryption already but want permission so they don&#39;t have to break the law anymore, and maybe more importantly to them, giving the appearance of integrity to citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, the cybersecurity community agrees that the NSA cannot decrypt 2048-bit encryption.  There isn&#39;t enough computing power.  Apple uses  2048-bit RSA keys or

<p>If the FBI already broke the encryption, they wouldn&#39;t need to drag Apple into it, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well dude, I hope your right. Wikileaks is being Wikileaks or your link is busted. But I&#39;ll take your word for it, I want you to be right.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still inclined disagree though, I&#39;ve done lots of reading there, especially way back in the day. The docs that pass through there are not all legit or of the same caliber, there&#39;s a great deal of old fashioned manual sifting involved in getting usable information from wiki leaks. You can&#39;t take anything read in isolation at face value.</p>

<p>Also when talking &#39;Armor VS projectiles.&#39; The best armor in the world will fail if hit repeatedly, or just the right way, even on accident, by just about anything. So my money is on the &#39;projectiles&#39; every time.</p>

<p>The main point is the amassed meta data, various fake cell towers, and access to anything that isn&#39;t encrypted incoming, on, and outgoing. They don&#39;t <em>need</em> to break the encryption because of that, but breaking the encryption makes it <em>faster.</em></p>

<p>We don&#39;t know their capabilities, we can&#39;t assume any encryption is safe, especially if they are publicly challenging encryption as a whole. 99% of the time when the gov wants something to be legal it&#39;s because they have broken the law and done what it is they want already, and want to make what they did legal after the fact.</p>

<p>There&#39;s know way of knowing if the constants used in the equation are what they say they are. We also don&#39;t know how much truth Snowden leaks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1818, the United States Supreme Court decided Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward – 17 U.S. 518 (1819), writing: &quot;The opinion of the Court, after mature deliberation, is that this corporate charter is a contract, the obligation of which cannot be impaired without violating the Constitution of the United States. This opinion appears to us to be equally supported by reason, and by the former decisions of this Court.&quot; Beginning with this opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court has continuously recognized corporations as having the same rights as natural persons to contract and to enforce contracts.</p>

<p>and that it is laid out clearly literally in the 1st Chapter of the 1st Title of US (Legal) Code. This wording dates back to at least 1947.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ikr them companies coming to our countries taking out jobs</p>

<p>In fact I&#39;d be willing to believe just because of my disillusionment with the system and no evidence at hand that the worst situation possible is what is happening.</p>

<p>That will show those following the crowd sheep.</p>

<p>Hah.</p>

<p>/s</p>

<p>For real though guys and gals, I don&#39;t know whether to think this or not. I would not put it past them and had the same thought before even seeing this post but there is little evidence for this happening. Actually I suppose the whole NSA/Five Eyes thing is pretty huge evidence that these activities are likely going on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is actually what&#39;s going on. So, I guess not. The Prism program and the likes relied on the telecoms assistant in wiretapping dating back over 100 years.

<p>Okay. Well, I&#39;ve been in the corporate tech industry for years, but before that I was pretty well versed in cell tech because that was my job. But it&#39;s entirely possible you know something I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>So the part I&#39;m most interested in is this:</p>

<p>Can you please expand on this? Tell me in your own words what you mean by that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well shit, thanks for that. I guess that&#39;s the fishiness everyone is suspecting.
With the encryption it&#39;s no different than how a VPN encrypts traffic. End to end so those passively sniffing traffic (Feds) don&#39;t see plain text. I use android tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I just a different market, private email, private sync server. Everything still works, including games and navigation. </p>

<p>The negative? It&#39;s a pain in the ass to set up the first time and costs about $25/year. </p>

<p>The pros?  You know that all your information is secure, encrypted, and not being sold for advertisements. </p>
