<p>In the mean time, here are some videos that do a really good job at showing how obvious the physics are that have to do with the freefall collapse. The math provides the best case scenario for the official story and doesn&#39;t even include the redundancy in strength from safety factors, which to me is what really shows just how ridiculous it is to think the top of a steel building would fall through the whole structure that was previously holding it up.</p>

<p>Show them to friends, family, co-workers. Even if they are skeptical, this is a very good introductory point into the whole thing. There are three short parts, but you can skip the first to get right to the meat and potatoes. </p>

It was a international family dynasty operation tho.

Anyway they talked about using thermite. Directional thermite or cutting blows.
That show went off air before 9/11 or soon after. And subsequently all other shows pertaining to controlled demolition ceased outright.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think it&#39;s safe to say that if we continue to do nothing, it will only get worse. At the same time, it&#39;s not as  bad now as it&#39;s going to get, and we still have some major advantages with the internet, but even that is being threatened by internet censorship/regulation bills that will probably be used to prevent information from even being available about this conspiracy or any other. We don&#39;t exactly know just how comprehensive their abilities are, but like I said, we&#39;re better off now than we will be as time goes on. We have the truth on our side, which is a powerful tool that they simply do not have, despite how much they attempt to distort reality. Millions watched the viral blacksmith video, and I&#39;m absolutely certain that the only way the truth will be widely accepted is through an equally convincing viral video. I thought about staging a similar style video appealing to &quot;low attention span&quot; viewers. I don&#39;t know about talking open on Reddit about specifics, but I&#39;m willing to talk to anyone privately about how to get this to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a shill, but I personally find it hard to believe that MSM was included in the plot. I don&#39;t think the ones planning the whole coup would have risked having more widespread MSM involvement, and certainly not any reporters themselves, but we can only speculate and maybe there was a need. Also, there are a few MSM reporters who &quot;accidentally&quot; described what they saw as controlled demolition. If there was inside knowledge, I really doubt they would allow that to be said, but who knows, they <em>do</em> like to stir the conspiracy pot.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, I offer one alternative bit of speculation. I can&#39;t remember exactly where, but I remember watching an interview with someone who claimed that he talked to some NY fire chief, and was told about some kind of &quot;levels&quot; of exposure to what <em>actually</em> happened. So basically it goes like this. The plot designers have a cover story that they feed to the heads of fire/police departments, FBI, military, and anyone they need &quot;in&quot; on the plan. Something like, &quot;Hey, so we really did know that 9/11 was going to happen in advance, but we were unable to stop it because Al Qaeda infiltrated some super complex system and it was unstoppable. We can&#39;t let the the world find out because it would be a massive risk to national security and we need your help to keep this quiet. And we gots&#39; cash money.&quot; I&#39;d think that &quot;the designers&quot; would see the media as a big part and just might try to include them with such a cover story, so maybe they really were.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is speculation, and I generally tend to believe that the best design is a simple one, and bringing the MSM in, makes things a hell of a lot more complicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One question undermines the entire controlled demolition theory: who wired it up? I don&#39;t mean &quot;They&quot; did it, I&#39;m talking about the logistics.</p>

<p>It takes weeks, if not months, of near round-the-clock labour to prep a highrise for demolition and that&#39;s after the building&#39;s been cleared out. For the theory to have any credibility, you have to convince us that whatever crew The Conspiracy hired to wire up the Towers could perform this messy work without anybody noticing. No testimony has come forward of anybody who worked there claiming mysterious patches to the drywall, drywall dust on the floor, work boot prints, or other unaccountable garbage that points to demolition crews.</p>

<p>Therefore, the crew would have to be working after hours, putting in only a few hours&#39; work per day, clean up <em>every</em> scrap of evidence that they were there and clear out before the first workers arrived every morning, and continue this for <em>months</em> without a single slip-up. Even for The Conspiracy, this is a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it does not question the entire controlled demolition theory. The fact is that they WERE blown up from within. We can scratch our heads and debate over how that was possible, but one way or another, they did it. </p>

<p>You are suggesting that something was too complex to occur despite irrefutable evidence that proves it&#39;s occurrence. I know it&#39;s hard to understand, and if you <em>really</em> want to know how &quot;they&quot; did it, you&#39;ll get your answer if we ever manage to convince our sheepish, idiot people that complicated things are possible. Clearly it&#39;s not looking good for us, so we may just never know. </p>

<p>edit: All you can do is speculate and try to imagine troupes of demolition specialists somehow sneaking in the towers night after night and carried out their business. In reality, the operation would have been EXTREMELY complicated. It would probably make for an incredible Ocean&#39;s 11 type flick. They have the most advanced military and operations technology in the world. Shit that would make Ocean&#39;s crew look like kindergartners.</p>

<p>Also, it sure makes it a lot easier when Marvin Bush, GW&#39;s <em>brother</em> was director of Securacom, the very company responsible for security of the buildings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the destruction of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 were caused by fire, this would make them the first steel framed high-rise buildings in history to suffer total fire-induced collapse (combined with structural damage from the airplane impacts in the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2). They would also be the first fire-induced collapses to exhibit nearly all of the features of controlled demolition and none of the features of fire-induced collapse</p>

<li><p>&quot;It fell straight down, that means it was rigged!&quot; Buildings are designed to bear their weight straight down. Once the portion above the impact popped free, it fell down, hitting the next intact floor with all of its weight, popping that one free, and so one down to the ground. The only way it could have fallen any direction but straight down would be to destroy a portion of the base in the direction you want it to go.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;A plane wouldn&#39;t be enough to bring it down!&quot; The towers were designed to withstand a collision from a 707, which is smaller and slower than the 767s that hit them. Said 767s were also cross-country flights, so they were full of fuel (read: flying bombs).</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Free fall speed!&quot; No, they did not. The stuff falling off the towers hit the ground far faster than the towers themselves because the downward movement briefly stops to transfer momentum to each successive floor. The towers did not &quot;free-fall&quot; because they could not.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Explosions means demolition!&quot; The buildings were full of electrical cables, water mains, and rivets. What does a water pipe sound like when the water inside is super-heated and breaches it? What do rivets sound like when they get popped out of a failing structure? What happens when an electrical cable comes down? It all looks and sounds like (and in the case of the water pipes, literally is) an explosion. Eye-witness reports of electrical explosions, popping rivets, and bodies hitting the ground are deliberately being misrepresented as &quot;explosions.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Silverstein was conveniently gone that morning!&quot; The fact that one person associated with the towers wasn&#39;t there in the morning does nothing to prove the conspiracy. Dozens of other people who worked there were also not present, does that mean they were part of the conspiracy, too? If Silverstein was warned, why wasn&#39;t the head of the Port Authority warned?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I was looking around and I found two examples of steel-frame buildings collapsing straight down due to fire: the McCormick Center in Chicago (1967) and the Sight and Sound Theater in Strasburg, Pennsylvania (Jan 28, 1997). Yeah, this wasn&#39;t unprecedented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, let me get this out of the way and cleared up right quick. You just claimed that the towers did not fall in freefall, while NIST, your shining white knight bearing the official story, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHng42BpHDc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=75">ADMITS <strong>freefall</strong></a> in all three buildings, which they were forced to do after denying for years, changing their position to accommodate the bombardment of empirical evidence by angry physics teachers.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s why that matters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>At standstill, before collapsing, the building has <em>gravitational potential energy</em> or &quot;GPE&quot;. When the structure below gives way, even if only due to fire, the top of the building is set in motion and the GPE is now <em>kinetic energy</em> or &quot;KE&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Since energy is not lost, 100% of GPE is converted to KE. </p></li>
<li><p>If there was nothing below the top section of tower, it would fall at 9.8m/s/s with downward acceleration due to gravity, meeting only air that occupies the space below providing a resistive force, expending a small amount of KE in the form of heat due to friction. This is called freefall.</p></li>
<li><p>With this definition of freefall, if the falling chunk meets ANY resistance especially any body that is NOT in motion, <strong>it will NOT fall at freefall</strong>.
The above statement alone serves as proof that a force other than kinetic energy is present, since the buildings <em>did</em> fall in freefall.</p></li>
<li><p>The big question is <strong>where did this tremendous energy come from?</strong> High energy demolition devices is the <em>only</em> logical source capable of removing vertical core columns and pulverizing <em>everything</em> in the buildings, clearing a path of almost ZERO resistance. </p></li>
<li><p>Best case calculations (in favor of official storytale), assuming that there are no perimeter <em>or</em> core columns, leaving the floors floating in the air, show at least 40 seconds to reach the ground. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your last two bullets have nothing to do with the physics of the collapse and do not serve as proof of either argument. You just made up those quotes based on common arguments cited by other &quot;twoofers&quot; which came out of nowhere considering that there has been no mention of Silverstein <strong>or his two kid&#39;s</strong> absence on 9/11 in this threads, so I&#39;m going to assume you are trying to change the topic because you know you won&#39;t win the physics argument.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No, his coincidental absence is not my <em>proof</em> of his being complicit or even having foreknowledge or forewarning, though I&#39;ll humor your desire to speculate. It does remain a fact that he <em>was</em> absent that morning and was there <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ScGZCqEyGM">every single morning prior</a>, having breakfast meetings on the 105th floor with new tenants. It sounds like a real possibility that he would commit insurance fraud and destroy his buildings since he was facing a 5 to 10 billion dollar mandatory renovation because of asbestos throughout, far exceeding the buildings&#39; value. If we&#39;re still speculating, I&#39;m gonna say that he is guilty of insurance fraud, but only due to his foreknowledge. To say that this lone evil man had his buildings destroyed as a part of this brilliant insurance fraud idea <em>is</em> absurd. It&#39;s a lot more likely that the buildings were chosen as the ideal target for a false-flag which would pave way for the Patriot Act that the Bush Admin was so eager to pass, while also benefiting Silverstein with his insurance gig, and also to cover up all the data that could trace back the insider trading that happened before 9/11, and records of the investigation into the missing $2.2 <em>Trillion</em>. I couldn&#39;t possibly name every single benefit or beneficiary of the attacks, but there&#39;s a good starting point. It&#39;s sickly funny in a way, normally, all it takes is ONE person with a motive to investigate and determine guilt. In this case, there are probably hundreds. Such wow.</p></li>
<li><p>It only takes one &quot;legitimate sounding&quot; interview to completely convince people like yourself that the whole thing is legitimate, so that you can go back to not worrying about it. You are scared of what it means if it is true, and you are naturally relieved at the slightest hint of something that might back your fairytale. The problem with that is that it leaves you completely vulnerable to being fooled, since someone only needs to lie to you for you to believe them. That&#39;s called being gullible.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, the McCormick Center was a warehouse building where only the roof caved in with the help of the additional weight of a heavy snow on the roof. This is in no way comparable to a 110 story skyscraper, namely, the overly redundant vertical steel columns running the core and perimeter of the building. Additionally, these were single story buildings, meaning that if the roof caves, collapse to the ground is inevitable, and oddly enough, the ground acts as a resistive force, and manages not to implode all the way through the Earth to China...</p>

<p>You are comparing jellyfish to dinosaurs. Sorry, no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. What it <strong>actually means</strong> is we have (according to the official government story) multiple high rise fires to compare it to. Fires that were at least as severe, and possibly <strong>more severe</strong> than the 9/11 fires. With 0 global collapses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza, both
commercial office buildings, had fires that fully
involved entire floors. In both buildings, vertical spread 
of fire was by external flame exposure, breaking
glass windows from the outside and igniting office furnishings
in the floor above. By contrast, the fires in
WTC 7 spread across several floors, but did not involve
an entire floor at any given time. Additionally, in
WTC 7 there was no evidence of floor-to-floor fire spread 
in the photographic and videographic records.
Finally, the combustible load was likely similar in First 
Interstate Bank, One Meridian Plaza, and WTC 7,
with the combustible load in One Meridian Plaza perhaps 
even greater as it was described subjectively as
“heavy.” <strong>NIST therefore concluded that the fires in First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza were at
least as severe, and probably more severe, than the fires in WTC 7.&quot;</strong> NIST NCSTAR 1-9 pg. 341</p>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t, it is a proven scientific fact that all three WTC skyscrapers were part of a controlled demolition, if the linch pin for you is how they could possibily have got in there, then i suggest you read the below, written by Keven Ryan, who is doing an AMA tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s another question: why bother with explosives if They were going to fly planes into the towers anyway? Just the image of the &quot;terrorist&quot; attack should have been enough for Their agenda. Since They obviously have no regard for human life, any possible collapse of the towers would have been acceptable (e.g. falling over and destroying neighbouring buildings), so why spend all the extra effort to devise an elaborate plan of rigging the buildings so they&#39;d fall straight down?</p>

<p>Because then the official story would have to explain how the terrorists had access to the towers. Since the planes aren&#39;t sufficient to globally collapse the towers. Explosives are required.</p>

<p>It&#39;s totally cool to ask questions. It&#39;s not cool to pretend your questions &quot;undermine&quot; anything. </p>
