<p>So telling somebody that the symptoms they are experiencing are well known potential warning signs for schizophrenia and they should see a doctor is now advice that should be deleted?</p>

<p>OP has already been diagnosed by a professional as having schizophrenia which would certainly imply that through medical analysis it has been determined that they are in fact somewhat delusional.  This reply to the post states that rather than listening to the non-professionals of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> , they follow the advice of a medical professional that they have already seen.  Again, apparently this is enough to warrant deleting the post somehow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just wait, so saying that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t filled with qualified psychiatrists or psychologists is now insulting to the sub?  The rules around here have gotten <em>incredibly</em> tight recently in order to excuse blatant censorship.  This is something that has inexplicably increased in recent weeks, maybe it has something to do with the primaries.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Somebody with the necessary training already told the OP that they were suffering from schizophrenia.  This person was merely repeating the advice of a medical professional who <strong>does</strong> have the training.  Again, apparently repeating what trained professionals advise somebody to do is now against the rules here.</p>

<p>This is blatant censorship in disguise, it seems as though there is now a unified effort to turn this place into a safe space for anti-scientists.  It makes no sense.</p>

<p>Your reasoning stretches those rules to the absolute extremes of their relevance.  </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that you simply deleted the top voted post to the thread which provided sound medical advice (which was supported by a professional diagnosis) to somebody struggling with mental issues.  Not only is this the effective censorship of the person who had the most popular reply in the thread thread, but there could be actually dangerous consequences to deleting a post recommending that somebody who <em>hears voices should seek medical help</em>.  It&#39;s absolutely disgusting and a blatant disregard for the well-being of another person apparently due to somebody &quot;mocking the sub&quot;.  That&#39;s quite the deplorable set of priorities, <em>&quot;oh somebody suggests that a diagnosed schizophrenic seek medical help, but they also said that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t filled with psychiatrists, gotta delete that post!&quot;</em></p>

<p>This is absolutely insane, the rules have remained unchanged, yet they are being enforced in an absolutely ludicrous, loosely defined manner.  The rise in post removals lately must be intentional, there has to be some motive behind the rash post deletions lately, it simply reeks of opinionated censorship.</p>

<p>You can justify it however you see fit, the rules are apparently flexible enough to allow for the personal biases of moderators to seep through.  The fact of the matter is that you deleted a post that regurgitated the advice provided by medical professionals which is, quite simply, dangerous.  </p>

<p>Blanketing this fact in all the Rule 4 and Rule 10 violations you arbitrarily seem to feel apply in this case doesn&#39;t help anything.  You can&#39;t deny the fact that you removed the opinion of somebody who believed the OP should seek medical attention which is not only prudent, but also reflected what the OP had been told by trained professionals.  </p>

<p>Saying that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t filled with people trained to deal with mental illness isn&#39;t an insult, it&#39;s a fact.  Not only that, but it was the most popular opinion in the thread, but apparently <em>very</em> flimsy rules violations are enough to censor the most highly upvoted posts on this sub if they don&#39;t match the worldview of certain moderators ... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  One of the main causes will be diuretics, diarrhea and vomiting (all associated with many kinds of withdrawal) costing your body sodium and other nutrients.  Rehydrating with water alone will only lower the sodium levels in your blood so anything nutritious (particularly vitamins, minerals and electrolytes) that you won&#39;t vomit up will speed the recovery and lessen the negative impact.  I always try to go about 1/2 Gatorade 1/2 water the first day-day and a half and a smoothie or some such as soon as I think I can keep it down.  I also take supplements, particularly B12 as soon as my stomach is calm enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like schizophrenia, but really this is something you should be working with a doctor (an actual, licensed medical doctor, not some quack selling snake oil) to sort out your symptoms.</p>

<p>I have a friend diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which started off pretty subtly to the point where I didn&#39;t notice anything weird about him, but once it progressed it was at the point where the messages he was sending me weren&#39;t even coherent.  But, with the right medication he&#39;s been getting along pretty well.</p>

<p>I know it can be scary needing to rely on things like medications to maintain your sanity, but it is important that you get yourself the help you need while you&#39;re still in a position to do so without difficulties. But, it sounds like you&#39;re already in contact with a doctor who can help you, so you&#39;ve already got the hard part out of the way.  It&#39;s definitely going to help you a lot better than the literal tinfoil hats that people here are trying to sell you on instead, and you&#39;ll feel a lot better for it as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>k. Your brain is a tuning fork, an electric system that resonates EM frequencies and deciphers the information. If you stare at pulsing strobe light, your brain will resonate its frequency. If you are processing sound, your brain will decode that as it again resonates that frequency of vibration. That being said, satellites info/ wifi etc  and all waves of energy that your brain receives are theorized to effect the frequency of your brain. Electric / magnetic energy exists from the proton/electron (H =1420MHz) to the earth&#39;s (schumann freq. of the EM of earth = 10 hz). should be noted that the human brain ranges in frequency depending on consciousness (theta waves when sleeping, beta when awake, gamma waves at higher physiological functions like being in love, critical focus, etc... it is postulated that EM energy directly effects human consciousness. forests are very dense and have a very low frequency and has resonation freq. that your brain can &quot;vibe&quot; with. Every biological organism (all life and elements, really) has a fingerprint like frequency specific to it.  so be weary of your consciousness at certain points, like sleeping (humans rest and recover/heal at ~ low freq. , which correspond with natural rhythms of the earth. im thinking If you lose grip on your conscious and get irritated, or other negative things, while your brain/CNS accepting destructive interference of waves might just lead you down the rabbit hole... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>go to your local police station and ask them to switch it off , i live in Northern Ireland , i have family members in the police .. they use it in lower income areas because they are a hot bed of paramilitary recruitment , if they say no . or they dont do things like that tell them you are an occultist and it interferes with your meditation , you would be surprised at just how many police are sympathetic , but if they still deny or tell you they cant , ask them for a schedule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Edit: OP, try some antipsychotics and treatment for schizophrenia first to see if that helps. It&#39;s the most likely explanation...]</p>

<p>OK, this might seem unrelated and a bit far out, but there is this guy who has designed hats for alien abductees to wear to stop the aliens from controlling them (if you look into the topic, you&#39;ll find that alien abductees report being paralyzed/unable to control their bodies). The idea is to shield your head from electro-magentic waves, so I believe it would be useful to you. You can DIY (he has detailed instructions) or I think you can also purchase them from the guy who runs the site, thought it might take some time as they are made to order. Check it out: <a href="http://www.stopabductions.com/">http://www.stopabductions.com/</a></p>

<p>Also, I recently watched an interview with a guy who has been a victim of a Canadian intelligence agency mind control experiment/training. He mentioned at some point an experience where he heard voices and explained that they projected microwaves not into his head, but near to his ear to stimulate his cochlea to make him feel as if he was hearing something. I don&#39;t know if the helmet I linked to would help with this. I guess you might want to have it cover your ears, or at least definitely the area just behind your ears. Here is the link to the interview with him: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sau-pI_OI3o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sau-pI_OI3o</a></p>

<p>BTW, the experience of &#39;hearing voices&#39; is extremely common among mind-controlled serial murderers. You should have a look at McGowan&#39;s <a href="http://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/01/12/david-mcgowan-programmed-to-kill/"><em>Programmed to Kill</em></a></p>

<p>Good luck to you!! If you decide to try the helmet I linked to, I&#39;d love to know whether it worked for you or not. </p>

<p>(Lord, how do I even know this shit? Only after re-reading my post do I realize how far out there I am...well, better to be crazy than a brainwashed, sleep-walking member of the human herd.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Find out where it is coming from. Get a frequency analyzer... it could just be sensitivity to something like a smart meter. If someone is beaming shit at you, then it&#39;s probably very high frequency... Mhz-Ghz, so it can&#39;t really penetrate that well. If it is high energy x-rays, you need something like lead or tungsten, but x-rays don&#39;t bounce around a lot, so it has to be in a focused beam from some direction, so just build something that masks your head, onto the back of your chair, wrapping around. If it is radio waves or something lower energy, you might be able to just put foil on your walls.</p>

<p>It all depends on the frequency used, but you need a freq analyzer to determine that... BUT, as a catch-all against any BROADCAST signals that use resonance rather than directed high energy stimulation for effects... find a closet. Line it is heavy duty aluminum foil, all the way around. Make sure and get the doors and use conductive tape on the seals and hinges, and you&#39;re set.</p>

<p>If it is coming from above, it is probably directed from a drone or beamed from satellite. Since it is directional, you can line the roof of your office, but you&#39;ll need something pretty potent, like a mm of lead sheet... maybe 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ps.  noting the cynicism that your post has inspired, i am not surprised at all that we see downvotes on the qlink.  <strong>it&#39;s basically a Faraday on a necklace.</strong></p>

<p>also, there are youtube videos that show you how to make a Faraday - FYI</p>

<p>bottom line:  if you believe Faraday&#39;s work (as i believe they do, in concept), then you might wanna try a qlink.  (save money - get one used from ebay -- not expensive.  if you don&#39;t like it, maybe you lose $10.  just sayin&#39;.  sounds like anything is worth a shot at this point... )</p>

<p>hey ... and i know you are getting a lot of suggestions to &quot;See a Dr.&quot;.  mate.... IF you do, make sure and see AT LEAST 2 DR&#39;s... ie.., <strong>ALWAYS get a SECOND opinion about this stuff.</strong>  (i absolutely guarantee you benefit from the resulting additional insight/second opinion.)</p>
