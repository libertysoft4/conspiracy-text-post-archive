<p>On top of this, an ex-NSA intel analyst has been following this and can confirm that Hillary&#39;s emails are, unless foreign intel agencies suck at their jobs, are  in possession of any if not all that hacked content. There is also confirmed proof that Hillary&#39;s email&#39;s included the names of active CIA assets and officers. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Heres the rub.</p>

<p>If Hillary&#39;s associates were hacked.</p>

<p>And they read stuff Hillary didn&#39;t keep secure.</p>

<p>Then...(even though i&#39;m  huge lefty) it begs to reason how much Benghazi happened because of her negligence. </p>

<p>Theres even emails showing correspondence with Ambassador Stevens discussing the security of the compound months before the attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a veteran. I was trained (and becuase I understood the importance) to maintain the security of all classified information. I even turned in the SD card from personal GPS that may have contained latent waypoint information from my deployment. Reasoning was two fold: mission and personnel security were at stake and because of the legal consequences.</p>

<p>What blows my mind is that: she did this to circumvent legal disclosure of her email, handled classified information inappropriately and will not be held accountable for this.</p>

<p>Taking this a step further, big picture: why would anyone in their right mind want to take on the risk and responsibility for maintaining such a system. Doing so points all blame back to you. I am not saying the GOV would have done a better job but by implementing this on your own the exposure is too great to justify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are describing the reality as it should be.   Unfortunately that does not appear to be the actual reality.   When is anyone at Clinton&#39;s level in society held accountable for anything these days?  She could kill people intentionally and they&#39;d spin it somehow and nothing would happen to her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more ridiculous thing is I was just a SGT. The chances of me being targeted for Intel is relatively low. Secretary of State would be targeted by other nations, terrorists groups, hackers, etc - due to: notoriety, value of the information, breadth and depth of information, and the embarrassment to her, the office and nation. She not only could have gotten people killed, compromised operations, set back long and short term foreign policy along with negatively affecting the country&#39;s relations with other nations. I would be a target of opportunity - whereas she would just be a target.</p>

<p>The lack of consideration of this on her part, along with the lack of oversight and controls to prevent this by both the DoS and the GOV itself is surprising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. If I think of it in simple terms, we are all accountable within our own lines of work/friends/family etc. Community. If those above would be considered with the same accountability, irrespective of &#39;the rulers&#39;, eventually all will be brought out in the wash.
And yes, we should be looking much higher/behind the curtain, so to speak, in this regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She not only violated her own directive to her State Department employees to not use private email accounts for official business - which is in itself unethical and grounds for termination.  But on top of that she intentionally deleted the data in the face of an official investigation - which is a class 1 felony.  And top it off, she sent to secret information in the clear.  And other State Department employees better know what is proper use of email or else they can get fired or worse (something that is true also for just about every Corporate employee as well).</p>
