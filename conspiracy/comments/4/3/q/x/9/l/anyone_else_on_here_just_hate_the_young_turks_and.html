I find it ridiculous that they claim to be alternative media when in fact they are as mainstream as it gets. They always try to break the story down and let Cenk tell you exactly what you need to think. There are no real debates or discussions, only telling you what u need to think. Don&#39;t even get me started about John Iadarola, and his lame commentary...</p>

<p>Extreme propaganda/dis-info being labeled as &quot;Independent news&quot;.</p>

<p>They vilify anyone with a narrative that&#39;s not sanctioned by the goverment. I personally think they are either &quot;civilian shills&quot; or have there agenda guided by a unknown benefactor.</p>

<p>They are also super racist. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIxQSvMKWwk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIxQSvMKWwk</a> &lt;--Video basically taken out of context but If I had the willpower I would watch the channel and find something better. I haven&#39;t watched them in over 2 years.</p>

<p>Anyone remember the Armenian Genocide you will quickly understand why they call themselves the &quot;Young Turks&quot;. <a href="http://www.armenian-genocide.org/young_turks.html">http://www.armenian-genocide.org/young_turks.html</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not perfect but its nice to get another perspective other than the dross we&#39;re exposed to on TV and papers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine. Well for starters you will never see them go into anything legitimate about the federal reserve and how its at the root cause of our problems. They never talk about all the moeny printing and how that is manufacturing economies. Dont ever hear them go hard after the cia and its massive corruption. They never talk about Soros and his crazy funding of progressive groups (probably theirs if I had to guess). Though this particular Oregon standoff was mostly like hijacked with intelligence implants, tyt failed to put into context the importance of standing up to the federal gov&#39;t as it constantly oversteps. They are always race baiting, they never go deeper into mass shootings, they never talk hard about israel, they never talk about any of these elites, they never touch vaccines, and honestly i could go on and on. They are no better. Yeah they give u a cookie here and there but in reality, they are limted hangout and any real free thinker can see they are nothing special and just as much a part of the establishment as any other outlet.

    <div class="md"><p>According to your history I can assume so.</p>

<p>Anyone that disagrees with TYT&#39;s narrative is one of the following.</p>

<p>White.
Republican.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t guesses, it&#39;s simple science. </p>

<p>Their narrative caters to blacks and other minorities. It&#39;s not a coincidence nor a suprise a hate post for such a narrative that doesn&#39;t pertain to whites would appear here in <a href="/r/nazilovers">/r/nazilovers</a>.</p>

<p>Get over it. </p>

<p>I never said I didn&#39;t like people because of their opinion, I simply stated what was true and it&#39;s no surprise. Is that too real for you?</p>

<p>Of course you wouldn&#39;t know my family fought and died fighting Nazi&#39;s. But generalizing is part of your game. Just like the KKK&#39;s and Black Panthers and any other hate group.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done. </p>
