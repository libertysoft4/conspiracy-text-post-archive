        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I mean, it&#39;s still all over the news, every channel.  This morning when I logged onto reddit, I saw a stickied post that had over 6k upvotes and 13k comments.  And in several subreddits, the posts were getting so highly upvoted talking about it that it blanketed the front page with posts.  I didn&#39;t get to read anywhere near as many as I would&#39;ve liked to, because I had to work though.  I checked on my lunch break though and read a few more, and there were still several, but I noticed a <strong>HELL</strong> of a lot less than I expected.</p>

<p>And then tonight, after work, I get on and there are virtually no posts about it beyond <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>...?  WTF is going on?  I saw a post on r/videos while browsing through r/all, but all the posts are gone?</p>

<p>Do we not have redditors in Belgium?  I mean, we have redditors fucking <strong>EVERYWHERE</strong>, where are all the first hand accounts?  Where are all the pictures and videos at all?  Why is it only the same few circulating?  And why is there virtually nothing about the actual attack?  I went through about 8 pages of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and saw very, very few posts about it at all, and again the strong majority only from that one subreddit.</p>

<p>Did I miss some giant announcement about lots of people breaking reddit policy and the admins cracking down?  I just don&#39;t get it.  Everything looks suspiciously sanitized or something.</p>

<p>Then specifically u/tjhovr comment in that thread.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ll add it here for you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>God I hate what reddit has become. Now that the mods of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, etc are employees of news organizations and PR firms, they delete/ban everything that is user generated ( images, videos, comments, etc ). Now the only thing they allow are links to BBC/RT/etc journalists&#39;s twitter accounts or links to news articles to feed traffic to their employers.
Before, we&#39;d have real live on-scene images, videos, accounts, etc. Now we have to wait for the story to break on &quot;real&quot; media, then these stories are allowed to get to the frontpage and then a heavily moderated discussion.
Fuck reddit man. What a fucking joke it has become.
Edit: Wow, looks like I touched a nerve. I got a bunch of comments, I just can&#39;t read or respond to them all. It&#39;s funny watching my vote count go from 8000s to 7000s in waves in a span of minutes... Lots of brigading going on...
Edit1: Oh yeah,stop buying reddit gold!!!</p>

You&#39;re indoctrinated into this black and white world, if someone does not accept your political views they are immoral racist scum. Surely you realize that your use of racial politics to gain authority and refusal to accept other political views makes you the fascist. It must drive you insane that people are supporting Trump, I guess your next move is to attack the bill of rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really do think it&#39;s just an over saturation effect. I don&#39;t think people are purposefully not talking about it, it&#39;s just the circles that want to talk about it are getting smaller and smaller. At the end of the day, most people do not want to focus on negative things. When you start to focus on Brussels, you start focusing on Ankara, Paris, Boston, Middle East. Soon you can&#39;t say anything without talking about tragedies all around the world. You start to become less fun at parties and your heart starts to hurt as you see how fucking backwards we can be as humans. It&#39;s just easier to numb the pain with gifs and useless AMA&#39;s. You need to accept that as humans we tend to avoid pain. It is not a conspiracy that people are not talking about this. We are becoming numb to terrorism. We wish we could change it, we literally just don&#39;t know how to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read on another thread that in Brussels, they were asked not to use the internet for the rest of the day in order to free up processing power (or whatever it&#39;s called) for official work on the bombings - communication in real time.  They also requested that people NOT post information on what police were doing so that terrorists would not have access to advance information.  Maybe once things calm down, people will post more first hand footage.</p>

Furthermore, almost all the super delegates voted against him, meaning his OWN party doesn&#39;t support him.

But if we claim to be civilized, now that we have the information [thanks to literally pioneers like dr judy wood who &quot;cracked the case&quot; on HOW 9/11 was done, because you can&#39;t take someone to court on &quot;thoughts&quot;. people wanted a 2nd &quot;real&quot; investigation, well you got one. And not one word of her forensic study has been disputed because it CANT, because its SCIENCE, and her case went all the way to the &quot;supreme court&quot; [she is literally the only person to EVER go to the gov&#39;t involving ANYTHING involving 9/11 let alone lawsuits and sepinas] and was ignored]] we need to have these MURDEROUS NAZI SATAN WORSHIPPING PEDOPHILE IDIOTS put on trial with penalty  of death for the laundry list of crimes unheard of in all the annexes of history; crimes against humanity, human nature, the earth, and the very universe itself. These &quot;people&quot; don&#39;t even fall under the category of &quot;humans&quot; and theyre trying to take the &quot;human&quot; out of us ..  while you can, and stock up on food ... </p>
