<p>Yea sure, but to <em>whom</em>. Says more about the audience. Maybe I would rather filter off having conversations with people who can&#39;t see my point through petty verbal language?</p>

<p>Well natural selection can decide the practicality of that part of you because I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>And now, finally; what the holy shit are you on about. Ok, I may have ignored some obvious grammatical features, but fuck me sideways, it is completely coherent. Also this is reddit not a fucking whatever spelling olympics</p>

<p>Hmm referring back to my &#39;filter&#39; pitch, I think it works because <em>why the fuck would I want to have an &#39;intellectual&#39; discussion with somebody who is making a dumb fuck assumption based on grammar</em>. On top of that, your assumption is an ASSumption, it is weak as ass;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You don&#39;t know me, you don&#39;t know my agendas, you don&#39;t know what I think &#39;Smart&#39; even means in the first place, so you have no merit to ASSume that I&#39;m even striving to acquire a quality <em>that you</em> have determined yourself. </p></li>
<li><p>Pretty dumb and hypocritical (and ironic too lol), that <em>you</em> dare lecture me about grammar and &#39;trying to sound smart&#39;. Of course, <em>you</em>, with your prophetic wisdom are able to determine &#39;what undermines the value&#39; of a comment; a fucking know-it-all tells me I got an egoist arrogance problem.</p></li>
<li><p>I really don&#39;t care anyway; my philosophical perspective on the matter is akin to Socrates &amp; the Oracle of Delphi</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>The only reason you identify me with egoism and arrogance is because you have those qualities and you labelled me with them. Because you&#39;re aware that people take issue with you for those qualities, you&#39;re quick to judge others on it, after all, you have plenty of experience. You know how those condemnations are expressed so you can spit them out as fast as lighting</em> </p>

<p>I know this not because I know &#39;people like you&#39; or anything, but simply because that is the only reason why people take issue with anything - <em>Because it is one of their problems that they are trying to fix so they sub-concious has zero tolerance for &#39;broken&#39; qualities it is trying to fix</em></p>

<p>I have a different brain and different levels of toleration for certain degrees of retardation, it don&#39;t have the same problems with bullshit that you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there were an &quot;audit&quot;, it would end up being a <em>9/11 or Warren Commission</em> style fraud, an exercise in futility, imo.  I am very cynical of <em>fixing</em> things from within our current system.  The real levers of change have been removed.  I believe what JFK said: &quot;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.&quot;  </p>

<p>The CIA was impossible to destroy back in his day (JFK), and they&#39;ve had all this time to fortify and strengthen.  Bush even added Homeland Security, which is a massive program that benefits the state apparatus, and I do not believe makes us any more &quot;safe.&quot;  People are under almost complete control but don&#39;t even notice.  Most are just fine with the NSA spying, and that whole pesky Snowden thing.</p>

<p>I suppose my point is, if we really want our country back, it won&#39;t happen by electing even a Bernie Sanders or Trump.  They are almost entirely just figureheads.  (But most people right now, are under the impression that it will result in real change, which is a fantasy in my opinion.) </p>

<p>Instead, a revolution will be bloody, and probably make the civil war look like a walk in the park.  That is what will be necessary for things to really change.  Any half-measures will result in the same corrupt system in only a short matter of time.  Unlimited money will corrupt almost anyone.</p>

<p>Pelosi and Obama allowed the shrub to get off scott free.  Holder yawned at the calls for bankers to be imprisoned, and in fact he went immediately back to the lucrative banking industry, without most people batting an eye.</p>

<p>People will need to either be without food for a while or something major before waking up.  Even when millions of people lost their homes around 2008, nothing happened.  People are easily pacified and manipulated.  The average american is a dumbass, I&#39;m sorry to say, but it&#39;s the truth.  Hunger, or some equally motivating factor will have to get people up off their couches.  Even in the information age, the average american is completely in the dark as to how fucked everything is.</p>

<p>Someone here sent me this a while back.  It&#39;s been my favorite song for a while now.
