There are stories about nsa / fbi wanting to prosecute her but it&#39;s either political theater or obama is blocking them or both.  They&#39;ve done nothing about 9/11 or the joke of isis, or the violations of their own laws.  THey are cowards and they are going to keep cowarding until Hillary is in office.  Keep in mind, Obama is helping her win this.</p>

<p>In the case there is some kind of magical, unlikely coup within our intelligence community that literally betrays potus, then it will be Bernie or Trump--a lot of these people think Trump will be a dangerous question mark and they will be a lot more willing to put a person with decades of experience within the system in charge of nuclear codes than some brassy, bullying businessperson, even if they don&#39;t like a few aspects of their politics</p>

Usually those who get upset about be called a shill are in a likelihood a shill.  Why not just let the community decide if they agree or not with the accusation?

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good point.  It&#39;s hard to decouple a shill from someone with a strong opinion on something.  For example, I must be an astroturfer for bernie because I&#39;m a &#39;berniebot&#39;, always supporting him--lol.</p>

<p>My acid test for shillhood is different from that.  <em><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/42ug1e/a_litmus_test_for_debunking_the_pseudoskeptical/?ref=search_posts">The test is whether or not a person consistently &#39;justifies the system&#39;.</a></em>  </p>

<p>Because if you are <em>here</em> then you <em>already have a belief that the system is corrupt</em>.  Therefore, if someone consistently denies conspiracies, or defends Obama, or defends the NSA, or defends congress, or defends the status quo, or defends monsanto or defends GMOs; or defends Israel or anti-intellectualism/Nazism/nationalism/militarism (fascism / cryptofascism), then you are a shill for certain; because the facts of their wronghood have been exposed and are now <strong><em>irrefutable</em></strong>, so <em>taking an opinion that willfully ignores reality which also serves to justify the oppressors</em> is the hallmark of a <em>shill</em>.</p>

<p>Guess I&#39;m a shill then, because almost all my posts here are &quot;denialist&quot;. Except, no, I&#39;m not -  that&#39;s actually because I&#39;m not going to argue with posts discussing the conspiracies which I accept e.g. MKULTRA or HAARP.  I read &#39;em, upvote and move on to taking down another Sandy Hoaxer or whatever. [I also have a particular user for this sub, due to the stalkerish tendencies of some here] </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Except a lot of these, again, apply to proponents of conspiracies equally as well &quot;Double standards in the application of criticism&quot;, for example, we see all time. MSM? Lies! Russia Today or FARS? Unvarnished truth! And I trust I need not point at &quot;Use of ridicule or ad hominem attacks in lieu of arguments&quot; or &quot;Presenting insufficient evidence or proof&quot;?</p>

<p>To me, I don&#39;t really care about a person&#39;s motives. You can very rarely tell these with any degree of accuracy in an online forum, and in the long run, it doesn&#39;t matter. Facts are facts, and that&#39;s what both proponents and critics should be arguing about. </p>

<p>Just FYI I think you mean &#39;litmus test&#39;.</p>

<p>&#39;Shill&#39; has become a loaded word, especially here. It&#39;s lost most of its meaning, which was vague in the first place. </p>

<p>There&#39;s paid and unpaid shills. I prefer to call the people you describe &#39;authoritarians&#39; rather than &#39;shills&#39; because it&#39;s less confusing, less emotionally charged and doesn&#39;t suggest that you have unshared evidence of malfeasance.</p>

<p>That aside, I&#39;ve no doubt Monsanto do have their PR staff working forums - but there are plenty of non-employees who genuinely and consistently do support GMO&#39;s. I&#39;m neutral, personally, but I&#39;d say that to dismiss opponents, regardless of the topic, as &quot;shills&quot; seems basically to admit you&#39;ve lost the argument before it begins. </p>

<p>I&#39;m perpetually amused by things like &quot;The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies&quot;, because I see most of the tactics it describes being used by conspiracy advocates, every bit as much. It&#39;s not a guide to spies, it&#39;s a guidebook to virtually any online discussion. </p>

Again, not a credible and unbiased source, being a well-known haven for anti-vaxxers, any Big Pharma conspiracy ever conceived, and <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/02/natural_news_is_a_facebook_hit_never_click_on_itsr_stories_about_cancer.html">much dubious medical nonsense</a>. </p>

<p>So, no. Still not credible. Feel free to keep trying - though you would also need to show me how Monsanto are doing things other big companies&#39; aren&#39;t. It&#39;s what PR departments <strong>do</strong>. </p>

<p>&quot;Fact&quot;?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Folta">Here&#39;s the reality </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Florida had received a $25,000 grant from Monsanto <strong>to be used at the university&#39;s discretion</strong> which was earmarked for an established biotechnology communication program. Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food. Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while <strong>none of the donation from Monsanto was used</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So... What evidence do you have he received 25000 bucks? </p>

<p>Psychic justice - The delusion that one is psychic and can <em>know</em> who is a &quot;shill&quot; and then bring the hammer down on them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ANd calling a spade a spade is not barbaric or irrational, and it&#39;s actually the opposite of the latter.</p>

<p>History shows the opposite. Look at totalitarian regimes that mass-murder whole villages of &#39;shills&#39; because they are deemed a &#39;spade&#39; for vague and malleable reasons. Abuse of power and corruption like that isn&#39;t tolerated among the mod team here. That&#39;s more akin to the thought-policemen who run places like <a href="/r/News">/r/News</a> who have massive lists of users to auto-censor with their bot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Censorship</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Google</em></strong> are all actively rigging the access to &quot;controversial&quot; issues in relation to the 9-11 Attack, US Intelligence Community, Military Industrial Complex, US Warfare, Financial Sector, Mega Corporations, Key Figureheads and Politics. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1 Example:</em></strong> Some of the articles and research written and published just few years ago, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Mr. Snowden</a> made his startling revelations about the US Intelligence Community blatantly illegally spying on all US citizens and the methods they use, has either gone completely missing or has been buried under mountains of government/corporate friendly data and lies. The search algorithms, offered to costumers by certain private companies, has been modified to &quot;disappear&quot; the &quot;controversial&quot; data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2 Example:</em></strong> If you search the internet for 9-11 related material, you are much more likely to find scientifically inaccurate material, deliberate misleading material or material planted by the US Intelligence Community, than you are finding useful material for further study. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, you most likely end up with a &quot;The Arabs did it in corporation with Evil Alien Reptilians&quot; style material, which of cause will scare away any sane person. Sometimes you can observe how the Reddit moderator team blatantly censor new 9-11 articles by rigging the votes, only to allow a wave of misleading articles and posts to flood the r/conspiracy forum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3 Example:</em></strong> If you post anything on Reddit about the crushing economic inequality, corporate crimes, financial crimes, financial rigging (LIBOR, FOREX, gold, silver, interest rates) your comments section will be crushed by waves of paid government Sh!lls &amp; Pund!ts (or smart computer algorithms). If your post made it to the front page, they will immediately remove it. Most &quot;controversial&quot; posts will die a silent death due to rigging of the voting mechanics (their favorite method).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Reddit, owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a>, are serving their evil overlords well, this is just another brick in the great wall of lies and disinformation, created by the corporate owned mass media in tandem with the US intelligence community. </p>

<li><p>Avoid the corporate owned mass media like the plague: BBC, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, New York Times so on and so forth. Only use them as a source of biased reference to get a grip on the public opinion. They are owned by the oligarchs and act like a mouthpiece. </p></li>

<p>Independent journalism, good news sources and unbiased data is hard to come by...virtually impossible! I use a broad specter of news channels, sources and expert opinion. No one is 100% right and no one is 100% wrong. You must use common sense and look at both sides. Be fair to your enemies and be critical of your friends opinions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Censorship by the corporate owned mass media makes it extremely hard to get the full picture. It is getting harder by the day and the media citizen has no idea what is going on. </li>
</ul>

<p>Be the good guy. The world is full of loudmouthed baboons, fools, idiots and greedy psychopaths who shun no means to achieve their goal. Value human life above all else, mind human intimacy and fragility, we are all the heat of matter all at fault to some extend  for what is going on.    </p>

<p>Keep in mind though, there is an effort to subvert and sociologize / politicize science itself---so you have to fact-check the sources of the science as well.</p>

<p>Remember when that chinese researcher cured HIV but then it turns out he didn&#39;t?  That was to justify grants, now multiply that gain by 1M and that&#39;s the motivation the government has to muck around with science as a form of mass mind control--they are trying to actively mutate culture and they are very successful with everyone but the people here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that are watchign this shitshow in realtime.</p>

<p>You make a lot of sense but I cannot agree 100% on the limits you are placing, unless these are your own ideals. For example if there were a certain group of evil gazillionairs who were using Biblical scriptures as a road map to domination, then knowledge of Biblical texts would be crucial to defending against this attack. Science is a tool created by humans to allow us to understand the world around us and beyond but science tends to ignore what it cannot measure. Religion/spirituality is basically a stop gap so we do not lose the knowledge of good and evil, our moral compass if you will. Just mho.</p>

<p>Yrp.  I noticed this also.  It seems there is an effort to use SEO and SERP abusively by populating the web with a bunch of crap such that it will &#39;float up&#39; to the top of Google.  Now this isn&#39;t <em>simply</em> subverting google, they are too smart for that (I used to code for an SEO company)... so I firmly believe google is participating actively in the gaming of the system to promote content about pop celebrity garbage while demoting content related to 9/11 truth. </p>

<p>I used to get infuriated with google&#39;s abject inability to give me contextually accurate stuff anymore, but then i realized, &quot;no, google doesn&#39;t suck now...they are gaming, they are gaslighting, they are confabulating the public&quot;...They&#39;ve gone to the dark side (well, they were <em>always</em> the dark side)...it&#39;s very obvious now.</p>

<p>You can use Duckduckgo but it&#39;s not much better.   Startpage gets their results from google.  It seems reddit search of very specific things, plus your memory plus bookmarking is the only way to remember / recall stuff now.</p>

<p>They are actively destroying the internet culture and ruining people&#39;s relationship with information---on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is funny though that even Trump supporters use this safe space tactic now. Americans as a whole, left or right or neither, are losing their ability to tolerate conflicting opinions, probably because everyone&#39;s emotions are high-strung because the economy has been very bad since 2008 and I think a lot of people are in a mild state of panic, and thus avoid anything that emotionally perturbs them as much as they can. We&#39;re all making our own echo chambers so we don&#39;t have to feel uncomfortable, imo. Fear of others is taking over our culture, which I think is because success is harder and harder to come by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this, great point. I&#39;ve been frustrated by all the political content lately, too, but now that you put it this way I&#39;m realizing that a bunch of subs are dealing with this. I saw a mod post on ELI5 the other day saying no more political posts--I don&#39;t think it was anything underhanded; I just think the sub got sick and tired of all the political posturing. That&#39;s just one example of a sub I&#39;ve seen that&#39;s facing this same issue and is arguably even a less appropriate place for political posts than r/conspiracy. Additionally, the higher level of general political/current events awareness is also probably focusing more outside attention on this sub, making it more vulnerable to manipulation and paid shitposts. But that&#39;s another thing that should decline after the election. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s time to lose hope yet. I&#39;ve seen this sub go through a lot, and while I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s just as good as it was when I joined--I&#39;d really have to reflect on that--I still think it&#39;s worthwhile. There is a ton on here that I vehemently disagree with, don&#39;t get me wrong. But it is a place where skepticism is considered a virtue, and that&#39;s a rare and precious quality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what i have experienced in the past two years being a lurker here is that the mods of r/conspiracy are pretty damn liberal with what they allow here. I&#39;ve seen some shady shit here and there, and i think that fundamentaly comes from well worded butthurt posters who actually violated a rule and are upset their post was deleted. </p>

<p>There might be some legitimate manipulation going on here in this sub, but i think the discredit that comes from outside sources should warrant worry then the people who moderate this sub. As misconstrued as it may seem, this is truly the last bastion of free speech that can actually reach a wider audience.</p>

<p>We all have our differences, but every moderator of r/conspiracy seems pike a guy i could sit down and have a beer with. Remeber one thing about your online experiece, we are all real people as easy as it is to differentiate  a user name from a living breathing person. We seek the truth, and this is the last forum the will actually be heard. These guys are badasses, and sometimes they have to make choices based on the rules set that not everyone will agree with. Take a logical stand point man, we need r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here we see 911bodysnatchers322 using the typical tactics: trying to associate 9/11 truth and evidence of criminal conspiracies with UFOs, Illuminati, &quot;no planes on 9/11&quot; and &quot;space beams&quot; type disinformation.</p>

<p>Then, when this is pointed out, 911bodysnatchers322 makes accusations of shilling.</p>

<p>In fact, he&#39;s doing exactly what he is accusing me of doing. The 911debunkers site has never engaged in any low-credibility non-conspiracy theories about UFOs, Illuminati, or &quot;no planes.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead, the JREF promote associating the actual 9/11 truth movement with such things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks for standing up for the self-posters OP.   I personally appreciate it since I&#39;ve noticed this phenomenon and it pisses me off.  I&#39;ll spend literally half a day researching stuff and constructing a narrative to prove what I&#39;m seeing as a conspiracy to share with you and it will get like 10-25 upvotes.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I believe there is MUCH more support for this kind of stuff--based primarily on the overwhelmingly positive feedback I get in the comments--leading me to believe there is a sockpuppet army or software that is controlling my posts.</p>

<p>Like you mentioned, someone will repost some 9/11 evidence from 2006, or some kind of imgur meme, or even &#39;the history of your enslavement&#39; which is an old and not entirely correct cartoon I&#39;ve seen here not less than 20 times in a decade, and it will get upvoted like to 300.  No <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regular would post that.  Meanwhile a truther regular like molybdenum will post some new or obscure 9/11 thing and it will be stuck around 20-30 if it makes it that far.  I know there&#39;s a <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> sub, but it was being gamed so much also (by the same chicanery we&#39;re seeing here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>), that I know many of us left and hangout here primarily now.  </p>

<p>I wish there were a more sub-specific karmic means to self-regulate this sub.  I don&#39;t like inhibiting newcomers but it would be nice to be able to autokill already debunked stuff even I&#39;m guilty of posting (simpsons predictive programming comes to mind--my bad) and also kind of &#39;slowing down&#39; its upward ascent while promoting specific posts.</p>

<p>It would be nice if reddit allowed you to sacrifice some of your karma to promote things you think are important.  Like, I lose 20 karma to give 3-5 karma to a specific post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey no problem I&#39;ve seen this happening and wanted to point it out. I saw it happen with your post about the chocolate as well. I tried to up vote your post but it instantly got down voted. Intellidino said that they (mods) no longer can view important metrics. Seems like reddit is centralizing control over the system. Too bad because there really is no motivation or financial gain that I can imagine by doing this. On the flip side there could be incentives from outside sources. That is the only thing I can think of. I really do enjoy this sub and the people that frequent it, I just don&#39;t want to feel like I have to fight to get to the good/interesting stuff. The community votes should make that happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, I disagree. I think unless you really are a shill,  there&#39;s really no reason to get upset.  Usually those who get upset about be called a shill are in a likelihood a shill.  Why not just let the community decide if they agree or not with the accusation?  The people here are typically pretty good at sniffing out the shills, and should be allowed to call it like they see it IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here we see 911bodysnatchers322 using the typical tactics: trying to associate 9/11 truth and evidence of criminal conspiracies with UFOs, Illuminati, &quot;no planes on 9/11&quot; and &quot;space beams&quot; type disinformation.</p>

<p>Then, when this is pointed out, 911bodysnatchers322 makes accusations of shilling.</p>

<p>In fact, he&#39;s doing exactly what he is accusing me of doing. The 911debunkers site has never engaged in any low-credibility non-conspiracy theories about UFOs, Illuminati, or &quot;no planes.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead, the JREF promote associating the actual 9/11 truth movement with such things.</p>
