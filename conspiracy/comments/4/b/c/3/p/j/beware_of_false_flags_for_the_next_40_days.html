Their beliefs dictate that they must commit blood sacrifices in secret and in public, which are often done in the form of False Flags attacks. Though other types of events causing loss of life may occur (such as accidents and &quot;natural&quot; catastrophes). A favorite method is causing death by fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>London Police stated they were on high alert and expecting multiple, simultaneous terrorist attacks (they even precisely said something between 7 and 10 attacks, which, of course, is highly suspicious in itself)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is a misreading of what was actually said. They said they are now prepared to respond to attacks with 7-10 targets, whereas they used to only plan for attacks with 3 targets. It was simply a change in training and readiness due to Paris, i couldn&#39;t find anything that said they expected these attacks, just they they were prepared for a multiple location attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Government minister familiar with the proposals told the Sunday Times: &quot;We used to plan for three simultaneous attacks but Paris has shown that you need to be ready for more than that. We are ready if someone tries with seven, eight, nine, ten.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/12199959/London-braced-for-ten-simultaneous-terror-attacks-in-wake-of-Paris-atrocities.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/12199959/London-braced-for-ten-simultaneous-terror-attacks-in-wake-of-Paris-atrocities.html</a></p>

<p>I guess you could read that as if they think something is coming up, but the wording makes me think they saw what happened in Paris and adjusted their readiness plans so they wouldn&#39;t be caught flatfooted by a Paris-style attack. </p>

<p>The last time they said they were in high alert was right near New Year&#39;s Eve, as far as I can find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know when you act like a count people tend to treat you like one. You made a claim, someone asked, not unpolitely, for more information. If you want people to believe you and treat you with respect then maybe you should treat others the same, especially when you are making statements about potentially life or death actions. What if the poster asking for a source lives in England and hadn&#39;t heard anything about it yet and wanted help being pointed in the right direction. You sound like a duck and now he&#39;s less likely to believe you or look it up himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>April 19 – May 1</p>

<p>Blood Sacrifice To The Beast, a most critical 13-day period. Fire sacrifice is required on April 19.</p>

<p>April 19 is the first day of the 13-day Satanic ritual day relating to fire – the fire god, Baal, or Molech/Nimrod (the Sun God), also known as the Roman god, Saturn (Satan/Devil). This day is a major human sacrifice day, demanding fire sacrifice with an emphasis on children. This day is one of the most important human sacrifice days, and as such, has had some very important historic events occur on this day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One significance of 3/22 is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765">British Stamp Act of 1765</a>, which imposed an illegitimate tax on the 13 colonies (&quot;taxation without representation&quot;), whose backlash led to the American Revolution and the founding of America in 1776.  It may have been the first false flag for the illuminati to create america.  A country that only appears to be independent of british and vatican rule.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve studied the occult a good bit, and I admit in my ignorance I&#39;ve never heard of a significance of 3/22 being the start of some kind of slaughter season.  But it <em>is</em> true that May 1st, Mayday (festival of ribbons around phallic maypole), aka Beltane is a very important Pagan day of worship of the Earth, of natural spirits; with fire rites and rituals for protection and fertility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re forgetting American history. Britain didn&#39;t arbitrarily enact the Stamp Act, it was a method of getting the Colonies to pay their share for the Seven Years&#39; War that had recently ended; you know, the war that Britain waged to keep its New World colonies safe from the French?</p>

<p>After civil unrest over being taxed without representation for unwanted services (redcoats in the Colonies were viewed as unnecessary), the British government repealed the act on March 18, 1766.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know when you act like a count people tend to treat you like one. You made a claim, someone asked, not unpolitely, for more information. If you want people to believe you and treat you with respect then maybe you should treat others the same, especially when you are making statements about potentially life or death actions.

You sound like a duck and now he&#39;s less likely to believe you or look it up himself.</p>

<p>See, when people ask for a source, they&#39;re asking for what a person is specifically getting their info from. There are thousands of sites for any given viewpoint and everyone knows it.</p>
