    <div class="md"><p>-Every year, consumers in industrialized countries waste almost as much food as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (222 million vs. 230 million tons)
-The amount of food lost and wasted every year is equal to more than half of the world’s annual cereals crops (2.3 billion tons in 2009/10)</p>

<p>North American Food Waste Facts</p>

<p>-In the USA, organic waste is the second highest component of landfills, which are the largest source of methane emissions
-In the USA, 30-40% of the food supply is wasted, equaling more than 20 pounds of food per person per month</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My town (which has grown a LOT in 15 years) has been complaining about the smell from the landfill. Instead of doing soemthing like setting up a program to collect organic waste and use it to generate/capture methane AND the compost, the town decided that it needed to build a new river dock. Why? Well people with disabilities apparantly couldn&#39;t go boating. Now we have a multi-million dollar dock (that will NEVER even come close to paying for itself)! And I still don&#39;t see any more boaters... disabled or otherwise.</p>

<p>It blows my mind. There are million dollar houses going up&#39;to increase tax rev&#39; while the community begs to stop development and fix our now to small infrastructure. The papers talk about expansion being &quot;needed for the sustainable foundation of our future&quot; and how the tax money will &quot;improve the schools&quot;. Like a methane digestion plant and the associated jobs and actual methane/compost revenue wouldn&#39;t help the community...</p>

<p>Simply pointing out that even our waste is wasteful...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think about the abundance of food we have every time I go to a Safeway or similar. Think about it... there is more than enough food at multiple grocery locations in any given city. Imagine if these major corporations (Wal-Mart for example) could lessen their greed and allow even just 1% of the food at any location to be available for free instead of throwing away or keeping until it rots or distribute it to places that don&#39;t have access.... no one would be dying of hunger and these corporations would make a little less than than 12.8 billion (Wal-Mart 2014 shareholder return)...</p>

<p>Starvation is a choice of greed over humanity... we&#39;ve had more than enough for food for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overcrowding =/= overpopulation. </p>

<p>An hour long flight looking out the window will show anyone not blind that the earth is not overpopulated. I&#39;m aware an analogy like that seems naive, or trite.. but poor city planning does not mean there are too many people on the earth, which sounds like there isn&#39;t enough &quot;stuff&quot; (food?) for everyone.. It&#39;s not a resources problem, or a population problem, but a logistics problem.</p>

<p>&quot;Over-population&quot; sounds like a manufactured problem from folks seeking some sort of Malthusian answer but do not realize we aren&#39;t living in 18th century England sans technology.</p>

<p>Yes.  If I provide facts showing IQ distributions will that suffice?

<p>More opinions, I guess, since that’s not true either.</p>

<p>On the contrary. 30 billion is with first world standards of living. That’s what’s <em>possible</em> under current technology, not what is happening.</p>

<p>Because I can? I do believe that poverty is a desired result. But how can you say that countries like India are not over populated? Sure its possible for all those people to live in one country, but what type of lives do they live? Theres shit, trash, and decaying bodies everywhere. I know that has a lot to do with culture and it might not even change if there were less people, but there are still too many people (in my opinion)</p>

<p>But why would you want to be <em>wrong</em>? That’s the problem.</p>

<p>Which is why we should stop allowing immigration and giving foreign and food aid to other countries. Food aid is the only reason for the explosion in population in Africa.</p>

<p>Has nothing to do with the number and everything to do with the lack of technology.</p>

<p>because theres a difference between being smart and wise. Hitler was smart, but he was not wise. I believe some areas are overpopulated because the technology and resources have not been allocated to provide people with quality lives. To me, a million people crammed into an area (whether by choice or inability to move) where everyones life is low quality is overpopulation. My opinion is based on my morales, not the textbook definition of over population.</p>

<p>yes, this is called speculation. Even if its accurate, it hasnt been done, so no one really knows</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overpopulation = there are not enough resources to provide the global population with a basic standard of living.</p>

<p>Such a statement is abundantly false when you take into consideration the amount of wasted food and water, the amount of natural (i.e. clean/green) energy we are able to utilize (should we set up the facilities, which we have the money and technology to do), and the amount horded by a minority of the global populace.</p>

<p>Overpopulation is a myth perpetuated by those with too much who don&#39;t wish to share, so tell those with just enough that those with nothing have nothing because they&#39;re lazy/there&#39;s nothing left to give.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t, please don&#39;t fall into that line of thinking. Overpopulation is as much a threat as a pigeon&#39;s fart (difference being, the fart exists).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a word used by those with too much to explain to those with just enough why those who have nothing are in such a situation, instead of admitting that perhaps they do have far too much for one, single person and that providing a basic living standard for <em>everybody</em> (with abundance being earned, instead of basic standards being scraped together) is a better alternative to having a 1,000 room house to accommodate a family of 10 (plus the 20 people in their employ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, with America and the UK seeing a drastic rise in child poverty, homelessness, and starvation, Western lives and societies are definitely superior, aren&#39;t they?</p>
