    <div class="md"><p>Hoaxes are difficult to pull off. Hoaxes require immense levels of coordination and everything needs to go correctly for a hoax to work. If you were to pull off a hoax of this magnitude, it would have been entirely necessary to fake the event for whatever reason. Random violence is easy to pull off. Random violence requires basic levels of coordination and even if everything doesn&#39;t go to plan you will still cause death and destruction. When you have a standing army of out of work, disillusioned, and religiously controlled young men to do your bidding there is no need to perform a hoax. Just direct your imbeciles to attack a soft target, surrender their lives &quot;for the cause&quot; and reap the benefits, whatever that might be. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not helpful to think of the why or the how when &quot;these things&quot; happen. What we really need to be considering is who wanted to pay to make this happen and who gave the order to the imbeciles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t remember where I read it, but I heard that one of the reasons hoaxes are used is because the families of dead victims won&#39;t stop asking questions. It was the 911 victims families that demanded investigations. </p>

<p>I wish I remember where I got this info...maybe Jon Rappoport but it went along the lines that hoaxes enable the media to steer the narrative better because the mothers of dead victims are relentless in their pursuit for the truth. However, they do make a lot of obvious mistakes with the hoaxes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, hoaxes have their uses. But the point that needs to be made is that when a hoax is performed, nobody really dies. All of the victims are made up. If someone actually died during the hoax, you can&#39;t call it a hoax anymore, you have to call it what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. But it&#39;s important to try and figure out whether or not people really died. I think 911 was real but Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombing were hoaxes. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. If nobody died, but people think there were mass casualties, then you can call it a hoax. If one person died... it&#39;s not a hoax. </p>

<p>With regard to your examples, on 9/11 three buildings came crashing down and lots of people died. Certainly not a hoax. Sandy Hook seemed oddly surreal, and while I have no evidence to support it, I could believe it was a hoax, but I haven&#39;t made up my mind. With the Boston bombing, I have had a very odd experience. You see, I was born and raised in Boston, and much of my family and many friends still live there. Out of all the people I know who were at the marathon that day, none of them were near the blasts. Also, and most importantly, out of all of the casualties, nobody I know actually knew any of the victims personally. Literally every inured person who was known by someone that I know was a &quot;friend of a friend that was injured at the marathon&quot;. So strange... it could have also been a hoax, I just don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also important to note that false flags and psyops don&#39;t imply that people aren&#39;t killed.  A hoax is very different from a false flag; and false flags don&#39;t imply hoaxes or people not dying.</p>

<p>But you are right Dusty, that pseudoskeptics are the ones that try to conflate the two--false flags and hoaxes--in order to use <em>transfer propaganda</em> to transfer the taint of hoax-crying (the dys-empathy, compassionless delusion) onto a legitimate exploration of the event as a false-flag event.</p>
