        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s been a few years now and I noticed it more and more lately. Guess I had to be desensitized from the messages of corporate America to catch on to the filth media our government feeds our citizens. <strong>edit</strong> I now realize the shows we have on are from corporate america</p>

<p>Wife wakes up and has coffee and watches TV a few hours before working out, playing with the babies and getting ready for work. I don&#39;t watch it but it&#39;s on every morning. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the news because that&#39;s where I start. The local news is much better than social commentary like Fox or CNN. However, the filth they spread is on par. I see so many segments that are fear propaganda for the sake of fear. There was a segment the other day about how your floors can kill you. Every day they are talking about petty crime (unless something big happens then they beat a dead horse), household stuff you need to fear, sensational stories about patriotism, <strong>TERROR</strong>, and 1/3rd of the show is dedicated to rich fat housewives (this morning it was a segment about a hair salon). Their agenda is evident if you look at it objectively.</p>

<p>*Fear</p>

<p>*emotional tug</p>

<p>*patriotic call to action</p>

<p>*lifestyle piece for fat rich white women in the affluent neighborhoods (they keep the studio&#39;s lights on cause they&#39;re the biggest viewer demographic)</p>

<p>*fear piece again that tries to tie the community together for on faux premises </p>

<p>Then the advertisement show hits. The price is right. People love this Orwellian capitalistic (almost satirical) show. Come on down and look at our advertisements. We&#39;ll be right back after this advertisement. Welcome back! Play this stupid game we arranged around our advertisement. WE CAN GIVE YOU MONEY!! You don&#39;t have that!</p>

<p>Then the abysmal let&#39;s make a deal. Fun fact: This show with Wayne Brady is a parody of Mike Judge&#39;s classic movie &quot;Idiocracy&quot;. Advertisements again. That&#39;s an hour segment (I think they&#39;re 30 min) of nothing but product advertisement with a couple C list celebrities.</p>

<p>Then days of our lives. I&#39;m almost positive the only reason this show is still on is because those in charge of pulling the plug are Guiness Book of World Records egomaniacs... There&#39;s no other justifiable reason to air that show another episode. I&#39;m a grown ass 30 year old man and I remember that show playing when I&#39;d stay home sick from Elementary school. They&#39;re not just playing reruns...</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my cynical experience with government sanctioned media. Too bad my shitty $5 rabbit ears can&#39;t pick up the cool documentaries on PBS. They pick up the &quot;SEND US MONEY FOR JEEBUS!!!&quot; channels just fine though... Dude if I had money I would&#39;nt watch digital wave TV and be exposed to your predation. I&#39;d have wifi and a fire stick loaded with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kodi&amp;hl=en&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Dkodi&amp;pcampaignid=APPU_1_yKryVvCzKqj2jgSuoqewCw">kodi</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the cable distraction service till realizing what BS it is, I cut the cable now for over 2 years. They keep sending notices to come back for cheap plan for a year but I like the free tv.</p>

<p>My decision was cable moved some programs I liked to a higher pay service so if I wanted to watch those channels, I had to pay more. Than after being saturated with commercials I realized I&#39;m paying them for the commercials they used to not dump on the viewer.</p>

<p>If I have to watch stupid commercials, I&#39;ll do so on free tv. So, I disconnected cable but kept the internutz and watch movies on utube. I saved 50 bucks a month, put up a broken old antenna and not worry about tv cause I don&#39;t watch most the phony distraction programs anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s where you live for the local news part. I live in jacksonville currently so theres gang related killing pretty much daily in the westside but there is also a lot of people getting killed while riding bikes. I will say I fear riding bikes around here at the beach at times though since there are some crazy drivers around here. It&#39;s good to know how that Jacksonville is in the top 3 cities for bike related deaths though. But yeah they do push some b.s. on the local news at times. Maybe it&#39;s just the city I live in though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the internet.  Youtube is way better than air tv.   You could also learn how to use usenet and sabnzbd and not look back.  It&#39;s like 30 dollars a year or something for a private usenet account.  Netflix is 10 a month and its great.  Amazon is less than that and it&#39;s gotten a quantum leap in content in the last 2 yrs with the HBO / Showtime shows.  Those alone are worth at least 2 yrs of prime.</p>

<p>250/12 = 20 a month...way better than 100+ a month</p>
