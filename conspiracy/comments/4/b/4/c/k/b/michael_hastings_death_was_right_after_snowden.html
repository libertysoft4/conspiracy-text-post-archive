<blockquote>
<p>At the time of his death, Hastings had been working on a story about CIA Director John Brennan. The president of Strategic Forecasting Inc. (“Stratfor”), a CIA contract global intelligence firm, has described Brennan in secret emails as someone on a “witch hunt” of investigative journalists. Brennan, of course, has denied these claims: a CIA spokesperson told reporter Kimberly Dvorak in an email that notwithstanding WikiLeaks, “any suggestion that Director Brennan has ever attempted to infringe on constitutionally-protected press freedoms is offensive and baseless.”</p>

<p>Just to reply to this section of your comment, I&#39;d like to point to the tapping of Associated Press&#39; main trunks in 2013 during their investigation of James Risen&#39;s sources for a book he wrote in 2005.</p>

<p>Main trunks? What&#39;s your source for this? It&#39;s not in the linked article. </p>

<p>The AP&#39;s phones were not tapped. The Justice Department collected phone records, like who called whom, what time, for how long, pursuant to a criminal investigation. That&#39;s not phone tapping and the calls themselves were not listened to. </p>

<p>In May 2013, Obama’s Justice Department informed the Associated Press that it had, over a period of two months, seized records for more than <strong>20 phone lines</strong> associated with the agency’s staff. Soon after, it seized phone records and e-mails between a Fox News reporter and a State Department contractor. It has investigated the relationship between multiple New York Times and Washington Post reporters and their government sources.</p>
