        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all the attention lately on Hillary, Orlando, and Brexit, it will be difficult to give what I feel to be one of <em>the</em> most important conspiracies in the world today the attention it deserves. But if you read through my long post with a receptive mind and spend some time on the links I provide, I assure that you will have interesting discoveries if not profound revelations.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why the Flat Earth movement even exists? It is readily apparent that the movement was founded by <a href="http://image.prntscr.com/image/82c277018dc148dca7dca81ce425fcab.png">Zionists</a>, but <em>why</em> is it being pushed on such a massive scale?</p>

<p>There are two simple answers: 
1) <strong>Disinformation</strong>. T&quot;P&quot;TB know something about the true nature of the Earth/Reality and are intentionally misleading people into lies mixed with truth.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Discreditation by Association</strong>. By filling the psy-op with cringe-worthy new age/metro-sexual <a href="http://image.prntscr.com/image/3f3098e1b95644adbf0196938a8dc174.png">douche bags</a> and willfully ignorant and obnoxious shills, they make the alternative non-globe Earth theory -Concave- seem ridiculous <em>by default</em>.</p>

<p><strong>They know the Earth is Concave and they want to discredit it as much as possible by associating it with the Flat Earth.</strong> The surface curves UP forming a hollow sphere, it is completely stationary, and the entirety of the &quot;universe&quot; is contained <em>within</em> the Earth.</p>

<p><em>This about this for a moment</em>. Flat Earth is not the only thing being associated with Concave Earth. What other theory in existence has as its top content producer a guy who calls himself Jesus Christ and tells everyone to get his Mark of the Beast tattoo? You cannot do a search on Concave Earth and NOT have this guy show up on the front page. Don&#39;t believe for an instant that this is by coincidence.</p>

<p>There is a psy-op against the Concave Earth. And I will tell you why: <em>because the implications of knowing the truth about the Earth and this Reality are enormous</em>:</p>

<p>-We are literally living in a reality bubble, an enclosed prison/ factory farm where our souls are recycled endlessly through reincarnation and used as a food source.
-Aliens and UFOs are a massive psy-op to keep us afraid or full of false hope (The Arcturians and Pleiadians are coming to save you!! The Galactic frequencies will usher in the dawn of a New Age...blah blah blah) and may be used as a false flag invasion to usher in the NW&quot;O&quot;.
-Real estate is extremely limited and implementation of a one world government and takeover of land is a lot worse than you&#39;ve imagined.
-The role you play, your life, your decisions are far more impactful on reality and the fate of the world than you&#39;ve imagined.
-The Bible may contain elements of truth and hint at the possibility of creationism and that the world is run by Lucifer.
-The Sun is inside the Earth and nearby and could very well stop in place, scorching the land below.
-The Ether exists.
-The North and South poles might actually be ways OUT of here.</p>

<p>Now, before I present to you the Concave Earth theory, I will explain the main proofs why Earth is NOT a globe.</p>

<p>1) We see objects at such distances that would have them many feet beneath the horizon on a convex sphere in situations where refraction cannot account for or would even reverse: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8auPtlRTyM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8auPtlRTyM</a> (in this particular experiment done at night over a body of water, light would actually refract <em>away</em> from the surface because water holds onto heat more than the atmosphere above it, hence creating a temperature gradient of warm air into denser cold air which refracts light away from the surface. The laser is still seen in spite of this, showing conclusively that the surface cannot be convex.)</p>

<p>2) With elevation the horizon level remains the same whereas with a convex sphere it should lower by the ArcCos(RadiusEarth/(RadiusEarth+Elevation)) <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=255&amp;hilit=horizon+line+drop">http://www.wildheretic.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=255&amp;hilit=horizon+line+drop</a></p>

<p>3) Earth is stationary as proved by Airy&#39;s failure (named such, ironically, because Airy sought to <em>disprove</em> the notion of a stationary Earth: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dHMf9MYZmc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dHMf9MYZmc</a></p>

<p>4) The Ether exists as shown by Sagnac, disproving Einsteins theory of Relativity and therefore Gravity: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmlimH7laY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmlimH7laY</a></p>

<p>So, we know the Earth cannot be a globe. Then what the hell is it? People see a flat horizon and assume it must be flat. These are some of the main reasons Earth cannot be Flat:</p>

<p>1) The stars in the southern hemisphere rotate about an opposite axis to those in the north (Skewed perspective cannot explain this. Not even holograms can explain this one on a flat model).</p>

<p>2) The Sun would never set given the calculated height they give it of 3000 miles via the sextant (flat earthers will claim it sets due to perspective but the fact is it would never be far away enough to even come close to appear to set. To set within just 1 degree above the horizon it would have to be 171,000 miles away).</p>

<p>3) Flight times would not work in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Now, knowing the Earth is not convex nor flat, one might assume that Concave Earth theory is arrived at by deduction. On the contrary, there is empirical evidence showing concavity to the curvature. In fact, Concave Earth is the <em>only</em> Earth theory to be supported by a direct physical line experiment!</p>

<p>1) The Rectilineator experiment of 1897 erected a straight line over a distance and found that the Earth&#39;s curvature was actually rising UP at the rate of 8 inches per mile: <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/6/">http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/6/</a></p>

<p>2) Tamarack Mines experiment: Plum bobs were hung down two vertical mine shafts spaced a mile apart. The bottoms of the plum lines were actually found to be further apart than the tops. In other words, the lines diverged instead of converged and showed the force vector of gravity to be originating from a center point up in the sky: <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/4/">http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/4/</a></p>

<p>You also find very interesting oddities explained by Concave Earth. For example, one of them was the Paris Gun project of WW1 Germany. They created a long range super gun capable of hitting Paris 80km away but found a very peculiar result: </p>

<p>&quot;These experiments uncovered what appeared at first sight to be a strange result: that maximum ranges are best achieved at elevations of around 50 to 55 degrees, not the 45 degrees that geometry (and ideal conditions in a vacuum) would suggest.&quot; <a href="http://www.landships.info/landships/artillery_articles/Paris_Kanone.html">http://www.landships.info/landships/artillery_articles/Paris_Kanone.html</a></p>

<p>In other words, they had to aim their gun UP to account for the <em>concavity of the surface!</em></p>

<p>This very well may be the origin of the Nazi&#39;s knowledge of Concave Earth, which several books have mentioned but apparently has never been historically documented. Interestingly enough, Wernher von Braun had inscribed on his tombstone &quot; &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handywork&quot;.</p>

<p>Were the Nazi&#39;s on to something? Did one of Von Braun&#39;s missiles collide with a glass firmament?</p>

<p>Concave Earth solves some of the most enigmatic mysteries. For example, the passage in the Bible: &quot;And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament&quot;. This would make no sense in a Flat or Globe earth, but in Concave Earth, it suddenly becomes plausible. The glass sky only works in Concave Earth.</p>

<p>How much evidence do we have of a glass sky? A <em>ton</em>. So many phenomenon occur at 100km high that it is beyond coincidence.</p>

<p>-Radar waves reflect back down to the surface at 100km
-Lightning Sprites appear to hit an invisible layer and branch out sideways at 100km
-The Aurora Borealis starts at 100km
-The Schumann resonance takes place at 100km
-The Karman line begins at 100km
-Satellite guns were ordered not to fire above 100km <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/articles/abroject.htm">http://www.astronautix.com/articles/abroject.htm</a>
-Operation &quot;Fishbowl&quot; literally exploded bombs up in the sky as if trying to break through glass
-We have Sunbows, moonbows, sun dogs and other optical effects not caused by simple atmosphere.
-Meteors have molten glass on the outside known as a fusion crust that is chemically different and separate from the silica within them.
-Tektites
-Libyan Dessert glass
-Rainbows (chromatically abberated light)
-Predictive programming from the mainstream media: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuUqrnMBVqY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuUqrnMBVqY</a>
-And even HILLARY CLINTON boldly announces it in front of everyones face! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GssVFpTKZSA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=145">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GssVFpTKZSA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=145</a></p>

<p>Listen to what she says: &quot;And it may be hard to see tonight but we are all standing other a glass ceiling right now (audience cheers). But don&#39;t worry, <strong>we&#39;re not smashing this one</strong> (audience goes uhhh wtf)&quot;</p>

<p>Here is the fascinating thing: if we understand that there is glass in the sky, the Earth then becomes the perfect spherical capacitor. The glass acts as the insulator between the outer surface we live on and the celestial &quot;Heaven&quot; in the center. The tremendous charge pressure could very well then, via a form of the Biefield-brown effect, create an outward charge pressure toward the surface i.e. <strong>gravity</strong> while simultaneously creating an opposing charge pressure toward the center: <strong>levity</strong>, a <em>gravity inversion</em>.</p>

<p>This explains how an ocean would be able to be ABOVE the firmament! It also explains ancient alien theory where the &#39;Gods&#39; not only had a place to live eat sleep and breathe but the <strong>gravity</strong> to do so! Afterall they made us in their image, they came from &quot;Heaven&quot;, and we clearly function in gravity, so gravity must have heaven.</p>

<p>Interestingly, &quot;Nibiru&quot; actually literally means &quot;Place of Crossing&quot;, NOT &quot;planet of crossing&quot;. In the concave Earth then the place of crossing would be the center of the Earth, up in &quot;Heaven&quot;. The &quot;heavenly city of jerusalem&quot; spoken of in the Bible also makes sense here, it being 1500 miles wide, long, and high. That just about fits in the center of the celestial Heaven in concave Earth.</p>

<p>I came up with this <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=248&amp;p=2465&amp;hilit=gravity+levity#p2465">alternate theory of gravity</a> several days before another predictive programming commercial came out. Check it out:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDvToZlj8ZU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDvToZlj8ZU</a></p>

<p>Watch it very closely; the craft breaks through a <strong>glass sky</strong>, goes through a <strong>hot layer of plasma</strong>, does a <strong>gravity inversion</strong> and lands in a <strong>celestial ocean</strong>!! This is exactly what my model predicted.</p>

<p>The gradient of charge pressure may very well be the cause of bending light in the concave earth, the same way light bends through gradients of medium density. As many people point out, &quot;if it&#39;s concave how come we don&#39;t see the other side&quot;. Well, because light bends and flattens out the horizon as has been shown by geodecist Wilhelm Martin: <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/">http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, Concave Earth is the ultimate Truth uncovered at the very bottom of the rabbit hole. It is the missing puzzle piece that fits everything, EVERYTHING about our human experience together. Share this post, help get the truth out, help get this viral. It is vitally important that humanity knows that they are living in a giant terrarium.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DL</strong> Flat Earth only exists to discredit the Concave Earth, which through experimentation and logic can be shown to be the correct model of the Earth and Universe. In other words, the post is worth reading and this needs to go viral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into flat earth for a couple months now and was on the side of believing it but something just didn&#39;t smell right. They&#39;re are so many flat earth videos out now it&#39;s crazy. They&#39;re almost pushing it on us.  Like Neil Tyson and Bill nyes explanation for why it isn&#39;t flat is absolutely retarded. Almost like they want us to believe it. I just gave concave another try today and I&#39;m really starting to lean towards it. I searched this sub to see if there was any posts and here yours is three days ago with absolutely no up votes hmmm. Thank you for posting this I applaud your courage to do so even tho this entire sub will downvote and claim disinfo then go and push aliens and space on us lol. Keep on preaching and let&#39;s try and get outta here :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been concerned since I seriously evaluated the space evidence promoted by NASA and ESA.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m being serious when I say that something is really off.  I was able to overcome the social pressure to just accept everything fed to me as truth, and took the time to evaluate Copernican Astronomy, Flat Earth, Concave Earth, refresh on my physics, optics, relaitivity, thermodynamics, other general engineering coursework, and more.  Flat Earth <em>is</em> disinfo.  That doesn&#39;t mean we should immediately rule out Concave Earth.  We have to ask ourselves <em>why</em> is there such a (recent) focus ... resurgence on Flat Earth ridiculousness.  This, in combination with the fake Moon Landing, fake Mars Rovers and fishy ISS footage, was an impetus enough for me to actually learn and think, rather than just take a backseat like you are choosing to do.  It&#39;s your choice, brother.</p>

<p>If you bothered to even glance at what I wrote, I anticipated this question and listed off some reasons why it is important:</p>

<p>-We are literally living in a reality bubble, an enclosed prison/ factory farm where our souls are recycled endlessly through reincarnation and used as a food source. -Aliens and UFOs are a massive psy-op to keep us afraid or full of false hope (The Arcturians and Pleiadians are coming to save you!! The Galactic frequencies will usher in the dawn of a New Age...blah blah blah) and may be used as a false flag invasion to usher in the NW&quot;O&quot;. -Real estate is extremely limited and implementation of a one world government and takeover of land is a lot worse than you&#39;ve imagined. -The role you play, your life, your decisions are far more impactful on reality and the fate of the world than you&#39;ve imagined. -The Bible may contain elements of truth and hint at the possibility of creationism and that the world is run by Lucifer. -The Sun is inside the Earth and nearby and could very well stop in place, scorching the land below. -The Ether exists. -The North and South poles might actually be ways OUT of here.</p>

<p>Flat earth is a social experiment. The very idea of a flat earth is so fucking absurd you would literally have to have ZERO education to actually believe it or you would have the IQ of a potato. </p>

I have searched around for alternative sources and it seems the Polish people are really aware of the theory. All their thoughts are in Polish though so Aside from google translate I haven&#39;t gotten much out of it.</p>

<p>I like some of Wild Heretic&#39;s work and frequently post there on his website. I think more people need to produce content for this gem of a theory</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting about the Polish.  I will have to dig into that.  I like Wild Heretic as well.</p>

<p>I recently came across Cyrus Teed&#39;s work.  I think Steven works off of Teed.  Teed was a scientist, and one day he electrocuted himself and has a vision of a deity who showed him the shape of the world which he wrote a book about called  <a href="http://sacred-texts.com/earth/cc/index.htm">The Cellular Cosmogony.</a>  The deity also told him that he was the Messiah.</p>

<p>He developed a bit of a following which was then called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreshan_Unity">The Koreshan Unity</a>.  He also created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreshanity">Koreshan Premise</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A straight line extended at right angles from a perpendicular post will meet the surface of the earth at a distance proportionate to the height of the perpendicular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already run into this information I&#39;m sure you will find it fascinating.  He came up with his model in the late 1800&#39;s and it perfectly mimics the concave model today.</p>

<p>It is such a pleasure to run into someone else that has already conceptualized the concave model.  People won&#39;t even begin to consider this theory (evident by this thread) let alone take the time to really learn it and visualize it.  </p>

<p>So I have a thought.  It is mostly agreed that the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; exists at 100km.  Do you find it odd that it is such a round number?  It makes me think that perhaps the distance to the ceiling was used to determine the distance of 1m.</p>

<p>The generally accepted story is that the meter was derived from 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole, but I find this hard to believe just because of how difficult it would have been for someone to determine that distance in 1793.  (Granted it would be just as difficult to measure the distance to the glass in 1793...)</p>

<p>I am still looking into the origin of the meter, but do you have any thoughts about this?  </p>

<p>So, if a straight line is extended at a right angle from the top of the Empire State Building, directed due east, at what distance does it meet the surface of the earth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be approximately the same regardless of direction.  The concave Earth is the same size as the one you understand except in the opposite direction.  </p>

<p>In my calculation it would be about 46.69 miles.  You can do it yourself if you want using this <a href="https://dizzib.github.io/earth/curve-calc/?d0=NaN&amp;amp;h0=1454&amp;amp;unit=imperial">calculator.</a>  Just plug the height of the structure into h0 and then leave d0 blank and d1 will give you the horizontal distance.  </p>

<p>That being said, the Empire State building would be an absurd place to do this experiment.  You want to use what is called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IinxfgwR0w">rectilineator</a> which calls for a series of straight planks to be extended from an origin plank that is aligned with gravity.  If you used the Empire State building, you would have to build support beams thew same height as the Empire State Building (1,454 ft tall at the tip) to support this straight line of beams.  It would take a long time and it would be hard to trust the accuracy of the results.</p>

<p>You would be much better served to do the experiment near sea level.  This experiment has been conducted before.  If you are truly interested you should investigate the results.</p>

<p>[Think] about this for a moment. Flat Earth is not the only thing being associated with Concave Earth. What other theory in existence has as its top content producer a guy who calls himself Jesus Christ and tells everyone to get his Mark of the Beast tattoo? You cannot do a search on Concave Earth and NOT have this guy show up on the front page. Don&#39;t believe for an instant that this is by coincidence.</p>

<p>There is a psy-op against the Concave Earth. And I will tell you why: because the implications of knowing the truth about the Earth and this Reality are enormous:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m not reading all that.
I&#39;ve heard of the concave earth theory but i haven&#39;t seen literally anything to support it. Can you provide some good videos or something?
The flat earth is (so far) a much more sound theory as it can easily be scientifically tested.
(Although i don&#39;t believe in the concave earth at lease you&#39;re open minded and don&#39;t stick to a ball flying wildly through nothing!)</p>

<p>Here is a video showing that a Concave model with bending light is the only model that can account for the angles of the Sun we see at different parts of the Earth: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9puRZH0i6Sc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9puRZH0i6Sc</a></p>

<p>Sad, because he took the time to point out the flaws in Flat Earth, alongside a wealth of information in support of Concave Earth; everything you asked for is within the OP&#39;s post.  </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t you spend 5 minutes reading this post?  How much time have you devoted to learning about Flat Earth theory?  I&#39;d suggest you not remain willfully ignorant to information, especially if you are really considering Flat Earth as truth, as I do take that as a sign of openness which I appreciate.  You might find something that piques your interest.  </p>
