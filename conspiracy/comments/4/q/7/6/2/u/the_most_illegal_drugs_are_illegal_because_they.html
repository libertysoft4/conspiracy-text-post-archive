        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Redemption Song</strong></p>

<p>Everyone in college has has smoked cannabis is aware of the Marcus Garvey quote, <em>&quot;Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds&quot;</em>, sung cheerfully by Bob Marley in <em>Redemption song</em>.  A song to which one is inevitably exposed, given the community. The quote is frankly the one line I remember from that song.  I think that was the point.  (No I don&#39;t blame pot for not remembering the rest of the lyrics--my memory has always sucked)</p>

<p><strong>Cannabis breaks mind control</strong></p>

<p>No, there&#39;s no NIH study or pubmed article.  This is a folk belief with anecdotal evidence.  However, some smart people in the past have believed this to be true, and there are so many users from a wide variety of backgrounds who believe this to be true. So I conclude from that there must be at least <em>some</em> truth to it.  </p>

<p>After all, anyone who smokes cannabis and watches tv or listens to radio immediately burst into laughter in the throes of their high, simply because what they are hearing is preposterous: &quot;what I&#39;ve gotta drink your beer to be sexy...whaaaat?&quot;  As the cultural programming becomes quickly prescient to the awareness of the intoxicated, advertising is suddenly perceived as hilarious and weird--perhaps even alien.  You begin to wonder who and what&#39;s behind all this applesauce.  In one puff, you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist, doubting everything about the world around you.  And this is a good thing.</p>

<p>Which is bad for the establishment that wants to keep this technology under lock and key x forever, peons.</p>

<p>To some degree, cannabis (thc) is considered <a href="https://rootsnwingz.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/drugsinfoisbeautiful.png">a mild psychedelic.</a></p>

<p><strong>Psychedelics</strong></p>

<p>Psychedelics wildly alter world-view and rewire the brain.  The psychedelic experience alters chemical pathways in the brain, which is perceived as the dissolving of conceptual boundaries, basically rewiring your system as you experience it.  Some could say it&#39;s the active consciousness of the dream world, or &#39;dreaming awake at the end of time&#39; (mckenna).  </p>

<p>Several non-deliriant psychedelics (tryptamines dmt,psilocybin) and dissociative ketamine have the quality of stimulating neurogenesis, which is regrowth of brain neurons.  DMT plays a role in the immune system by upregulating some cytokines and downregulating others--it seems to be released during times of biological stress.<sup><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005052">[1]</a>.</sup>  This is germaine to the discussion because inflammation of the nervous system (such as from a stroke) stimulates neurogenesis (cell regeneration / turnover) in the same way as a cut stimulates scar tissue.<sup><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074747">[1]</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18662748">[2]</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22985767">[3]</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2707502/">[4]</a></sup></p>

</ul>

<p>You have a neuropolitical right to these substances because they are the only medicine for spiritual disorders; they also happen to be the only substances that actually, <em>truly</em> work for curing depression and mental illness--the other pharma drugs just &#39;treat&#39; them x forever--these <em>cure</em>.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s another &#39;secret&#39; reason they are illegal.  Because they work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had cleaner experiences on Mushrooms than LSD. Personally i aslo think it&#39;s important to try either of them in a calm environment, anything relating to nature works best. Forests, meadows, coast or even in your back garden at night. </p>

<p>Nature will resonate with you and feelings of &#39;oneness&#39; aren&#39;t uncommon. Neither are deep insights into the nature of existence and reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy both, and feel that they each have something to offer. However, LSD, although a fascinating chemical, being a synthetic makes shrooms undoubtedly more profound in several ways, imo.</p>

<p>The fact that they can be found naturally occurring in the wild and can be picked and eaten as they are really says something insofar as the plant/human dynamic is concerned. Why are they here? Where did they come from? Why does eating them cause most people to have profoundly moving, life-altering spiritual experiences, with long lasting positive psychological effects? Is it just us - are the caribou tripping too? They tend to be a somewhat occulted recurring theme in ancient religious context as well..</p>

<p>Also, when I take a low to medium dose of shrooms, I am infused with an unmistakable feeling of &#39;presence&#39; is the best way I can describe it. A warm, comforting female presence, a &quot;shroom spirit&quot; you might say.  After the trip, I am always left feeling pleasant, with an &quot;everything is as it should be, always was and ever will be&quot; sort of outlook on existence, which is comforting. </p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, at 1/8th (3.5gs) to heroic doses, it is a completely different story. The rollercoaster ride up can be outright scary, and LSD is much gentler in this regard (at least for me) especially because shrooms tends to make me nauseous on the come up. </p>

<p>Acid tends to linger for a while after you&#39;ve come down, personally I enjoy it (lots of laughter, sillyness) but shrooms, poof, they are quickly gone, and it <em>feels</em> like they are 100% out of your system, in fact it is a bit bewildering considering how monumentally fucked up one can be and in a few short moments feel completely sober with shrooms. It is very very clean, in fact, one feels full of vitality after the trip. </p>

<p>I agree fully about tripping in a natural setting. It is the way to go. I can lay back and watch the clouds all day...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always heard about the importance of a calm environment, but now consider this nearly impossible considering our mind is a collection of memories of the past. If we find our lives mostly stressful and unwholesome, how much could a wholesome environment for that one day really help? I would think one would have to immerse oneself in such a calm environment for an extended period of time (while sober) to really be in a truly positive state of mind.</p>

<p>Not enough in all honesty. If you have stressful, anxious mind you shouldn&#39;t do them anyway, it&#39;s not worth the risk of a bad trip or experience. It can also depend on your past experiences with other drugs as well however, if you have smoked cannabis, done MDMA or other substances and had no negative experiences then you could also be fine with psychedelics. </p>

<p>But it does honestly comes down to your frame of mind at the time in your life when you choose to try them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done mushrooms twice. The first time was one of the best nights of my life and the second was one of the worst. It had to do with the state of mind I was in going into it. The first time I was just going about my life normal and was in a pretty good, happy place. The second time I had some serious issues I was dealing with and they came out during my trip.</p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t risk doing any serious mind-altering substances if you are not in a great place in life. Pot, however, I <em>do</em> recommend if you are dealing with some personal things. There have been many times where being high has allowed me to see things from a different perspective or to be more reasonable about something. I think it has made me a better person overall.</p>

Ketamine made me a gnostic, first experience with <em>angelic pronoia</em> and archon paranoia.  Liked it maybe too much.  Mushrooms made me believe in Jesus... as an &#39;alien&#39; force of good.    Each mushroom experience has made me feel more, not less, sound of mind.  Should be legal.

<p>I ended up moving into a communal monastery where I found very deep and genuine interactions. Before I made this move, I was feeling this cognitive dissonance (&quot;psychosis&quot;), but I felt that it was simply a force that led me to a higher state of consciousness.</p>

<p>I have a pretty rad document you would enjoy. It speaks about the three kinds of physical and psychological qualities that, when mixed over and over, create the different varieties we see in this world. It&#39;s like the RGB of reality.

<p>&quot;Flying through space time. Wave at the pixel creatures emerging from the cracks in the floor. Which way is down? Why am I falling sideways?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel alive. I should drive. Why don&#39;t we dive, into another realm...&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I can&#39;t move. Why is it so hard to get going... AHHH. Now I&#39;m on the floor.

<p>&quot;And let the mind wander, from here to yonder star, as that part of your brain, which you&#39;ve never seen, is interacting, driving you in...&quot;</p>

<pre><code>Sane thoughts. I&#39;m cooler now. I&#39;m so thirsty. I think I can sit up now... OMG... That was intense. What time is it?

<pre><code>Swallow the crispy funky crackers, a gift from the gods. Chew chew chew, but try not to spew. 
It can be gross, but it&#39;s worth a dose. Magic fungus, what will you show me today?
</code></pre>

<p>0:30</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m feeling fine. Such a responsive mind. No pain for me. I actually feel free.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>The stomach gargles, spurts and cramps. Oh fuck, did I just shit my pants!? 
Just a fart... phew... that was weird. Stay calm, stay cool. It&#39;s not insanity, as you feared.
</code></pre>

<p>1:00</p>

<p>&quot;Magic waves upon the floor. Colors I have seen before. The walls contain smooth flowing shapes. I would eat this, if I were an ape.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>&quot;But aren&#39;t you an ape?&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Who said that?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>&quot;It&#39;s me. The all pervasive everythingness that flows through all existence.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m a Jedi!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Not quite. Ponder this: What makes me any more real than you?&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;What I... don&#39;t follow... the floor. Does Alex Gray know about this? They&#39;ve stolen his art work...&quot;</p>

<pre><code>Everywhere I look, I see the mushroom crook, bending down to greet me, and bending back to push me, farther into a visualization, no... a feeling. I can feel you looking at me. Is this how things will always be? Have I broken my mind?
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t do that. Worry and fear have no place here. Leave your doubt with this iridescent trout.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Glub glub. I lub you. We&#39;re the same. The trees, that plane. 
You are part of us, and we&#39;ll never let you go.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>4:00</p>

<p>&quot;Already? Time really flies... Flies... like those one&#39;s right there, leaving purple cobwebs in my hair, suddenly not there... so I relax, and they surely reappear. Wow! I have hair!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>The benevolent clouds look down upon me as I stare into the all consuming darkness that is the 
cosmos stretched above me, like a special showing of the greatest living art to have ever occurred. 
This life, this experience, this is all a gift. 

I cry tears of joy, but I feel no judgement. Surely some would call me a wuss, but I&#39;m removed from it. 
I can&#39;t feel that self-inflicted wound?
</code></pre>

<p>6:30</p>

<p>&quot;And I lift my mug of brew, reluctant as I do, for I can not stop my mouth, from laughing, giggling, as brew trickles south.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>The music is so awesome, the atmosphere, choice. Alone, or am I?, I raise my voice. &quot;What song is this?&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;The stereo&#39;s been off the whole time?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>Where did a chorus so fine, find a brain like mine?
</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s the fungus. We&#39;re you&#39;re friend. Everything is absolutely wonderful. The perceived differences between objects are exactly that, perception. They are not as unlike as you assume. But now, we are running out of room.</p>

<p>And like a train slowly breaking for the upcoming station, my brain realizes with hesitation, that every journey has a bend, and likewise, an end.</p>

<p>&quot;So how was your weekend? We went to see the new movie.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ate some &quot;bad food&quot; and talked to a metaphysical trout about the <sup>overbearing</sup> <sup><sup>existence</sup></sup> <sup><sup>of</sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>life</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>and</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>the</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>interconnectedness</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>of</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>all</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>things</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>in</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>existence.</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>We</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>are</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>all</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>one</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>body,</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>one</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>mind,</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>one</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>experience.</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I&#39;ve always liked your posts on here. I&#39;m happy to oblige.</p>

<p>However, I think I still have one more that I&#39;d like to get out. It concerns a combination of hallucinogens <strong>I DO NOT recommend.</strong> (The dosage of the plant varies wildly, much like Salvia Divinorum. You could follow what I did, to the letter, and overdose and die. I got lucky. I know a few that weren&#39;t as fortunate. I&#39;ve probably caused irrepairable damage to my heart from what I did.)</p>

<p>So I begin:</p>

<p>As the human mind flexes, forever searching for a nexus (probably around the solar plexus) it decides upon a route, that is overgrown with doubt, but I have my friend, the trout.</p>

<p>So mix as I do. A little of the common leaf, to serve as a base, a bit of lotophagi&#39;s delight, to brighten up my face, finally the emerald sorceress, her plant has no place. But upon this night, her I do embrace.</p>

<pre><code>Fire cleanses as it consumes. See through my work as it spews.
Now hold it close and don&#39;t let go. Keep it there so you will know.
</code></pre>

<p>Once, twice, thrice, did I kiss, but something seemed amiss.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t any different. Did I do something wrong. Perhaps I should&#39;ve used a bong. I will wait, but how long.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>And as I sat in solitude, my ears picked up a queer tune.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Maynard should be wailing loud, but... what is with... the crowd.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>50s big band music feels &quot;my room.&quot; But I am not there.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;This is not my room.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>No one else seems to care. In fact, they scare! Without faces anywhere!?
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Oh fuck, what have I done. I&#39;m not here with anyone.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I see, as in, I can only see the large dance hall that was once my bedroom.
Inside, humanoid creatures twist and loom. Greyscale, no color in bloom.
I fear my world is closing in. In a panic I look again.
</code></pre>

<p>I see the most beautiful woman, in a golden dress, dancing in my room. Where once was grey, green has taken hold. She wears a mask of abyssal darkness. To me, she looks.</p>

<pre><code>I hear nothing. But I hear her question.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Accusingly, yet pleasant.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;This is my room. Why are you here.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Without a word she spins in dance, and vanishes from my glance. I look around the room, and see my old bedroom.</p>

<p><em>&quot;... comes back around, to show you everything. Let&#39;s you choose what you will not see and then Drags you down like a stone, or lifts you up again. Spits you out like a child, light and innocent...&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve tripped many times, but never have I been unable to make something go away, at will. That was real. Too real.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I retire to the implied safety of the adjoining, smokey room.
I am relieved to see it has not changed.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Why am <strong>I</strong> here? Why are you in my room?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>As the brain counts change, trying to make sense, I feel estranged, from my common sense.
As I ponder, into my room did wander, a treat for the eyes.
For as I look about, I perceive a scorpion, of enormous size.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;FUCK!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I leap from the chair, and secure a baseball bat. But OMG where is it at!??!
I scan around the room, certain of my doom, when it reveals itself.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;DIE!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I strike truly, but to my dismay, the little bastard, got away.
In an instant I receive his riposte. I feel the stinger pierce my skin.
Searing pain... Must escape... 
</code></pre>

<p>I fall onto the dance floor, hard wood. Smells like pine, though. I look back unable to find the room I just left.</p>

<pre><code>Dread is my friend, for he stays with me, regardless of my wishes.
Oh to have my trout friend. I don&#39;t get stung by fishes.
</code></pre>

<p>But experience, preparation, and training save me.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;That&#39;s it. Breathe in... and out... In... and out...&quot;
&quot;This is not real. I am under the influence of a mind altering substance.&quot;
&quot;This is not real. I am okay. I am fine. Everything will be okay.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I repeat my mantra to keep sane. The scorpion escapes back to the aetheral plane, from which it came. I no longer feel its imparted pain. But upon a wooden floor, I sit. The situation, it does not fit. For my room is carpeted, and this new place is... not... real...</p>

<pre><code>A host of green, to complacent to be mean, make quite a scene.
Dancing across the floor, never daring to get too near a door, I sit and watch... unexpected gore?
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Why are you here?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>She has returned, but golden lace, has been replaced, with a rotting face, her mask, displaced.
I do not answer, instead I swear. Am I still in my underwear?
</code></pre>

<p>Like some twisted Michael Jackson video, faceless humanoids dance, zombie-like, jerking to and fro. They ignore me completely, only the woman acknowledges me. In some carnal ritual they begin devouring eachother, ripping flesh and limb with tooth and nail.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I think I was doing better with the scorpion.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Again I wander from the dance, still in my underpants, but when I arrive I am in a trance.</p>

<pre><code>I look at my surrounding, as my fears are drowning. Bigger still, everything gets. Shrinking, am I, to the size of my pets.
Like little Alice did before, I must do, once more. What potion did I quaff? Why do I feel un-safe?
Without missing a beat, my next foe desires to meet. And as I lose my mind, I pray that I will go blind.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Spiders made of serpents? WTF are you?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>&quot;What happens if he repents?&quot;
&quot;Another soul for you.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>As I have surely lost my mind, a moment of clarity, do I find. Somewhere deep behind, a whisper, a child.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Piper can save you.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>And so I try. I do not eat it, so gross it makes me cry. So instead it sizzles, to burn and fry.</p>

<pre><code>Hurry up. Hurry up. I donh wanth... to...
</code></pre>

<p>So hard to sit. I am so heavy. So very heavy. Like planets crashing into one another. I am gravity.</p>

<pre><code>Spidews, burble, donh wanth... noth real... Imth fine...
</code></pre>

<p>I lose consciousness.</p>

<p>I awoke the next day, on the floor of the adjacent room. Tool&#39;s lateralus was still on loop. My baseball bat survived. No more hallucinations that could not be dismissed, disbelieved. Never again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree, the reverse tolerance is brilliant. I attribute it to becoming less toxic, I consider salvia to be a detoxing herb so it would make sense that once she does her thing for a while you become more receptive. </p>

<p>I also found it amazing that it made alcohol and processed foods taste putrid. After regular salvia use, taking a sip of spirits or taking a bike of a chocolate bar was insane... so wrong. </p>

<p>But regardless, psychedelics are certainly not simply about the visuals, it&#39;s about the <em>feeling</em> and your personal journey.  Art is someone elses journey, a vicarious experience, at best, and useless at worst.  I&#39;ve even had trips where visuals were minimal, but the <em>feeling</em> and experience were still intense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like some awesome, intense experiences.</p>

<p>Directed towards u/melmelcom, but also you: what 2D image or even 3D virtual reality experience could possibly transfer these feelings/experiences?  It&#39;s just impossible.  There will be no virtual reality psychedelic experience, although I am sure they will try to pass it off as one.  To restate my grandparent post, these psychoactive chemicals <strong>do</strong> something to your brain <em>other</em> than alter your visual reality.  People who haven&#39;t experienced psychedelics tend to just think you see pretty shapes and colors, and maybe see things.  <strong>Such a confusion is part of the deception.</strong>  If that&#39;s all it did, and there was a slight risk, I&#39;d probably avoid them. But because I <em>know</em> it&#39;s so much more, psychedelics are much more attractive, especially with an admittedly slim to none risk of going insane, or whatever they say happens.</p>

<hr/>

<p>On sharing experiences: </p>

<p>I had a particular memorable Salvia trip where I could see an infinite number of paths my physical body and reality could play out.  It was like my movement could be expressed in an infinite number of ways; a thought that probably seems easy to philosophize on sober (something along the lines of parallel worlds,) but in this trip <strong>it was really happening</strong> ... or at least I perceived it to be happening; the exploration of multiple paths of time.   That is, time and it&#39;s usual steady traversal direction was completely under my control and I was free to explore different &quot;paths&quot; for a few minutes until I came back.</p>

<p>Truly mind bending.</p>

Let me ask you this, for these visuals, you have to have seen the man made structure and have a concept of it in your head. If someone done DMT thousands of years ago I extremely doubt they would see these new age structures. I believe its the same for these entities/&quot;gods&quot; we see.We know the basics of what we imagine they are like. Fuck dude some people see memes when they are blasting off. It is all man made shenanigans. When you die DMT gets released in your brain. I believe this is something humans have developed as a coping mechanism for death. I have had near death experiences before. Your mind/body does absolutely crazy things. In terms of thoughts/feelings/emotions nothing is out of the realm of possibility.

<p>I don&#39;t know if we are alone or not. But DMT showed me how much there is I can&#39;t see on a day-to-day basis. </p>

<p>The DMT experience is far too organized to be a random evolutionary quirk, or at least that&#39;s how it feels to me. Unfortunately no one is studying it in detail and relation to evolution. This is far more potent than the tradition &quot;intelligent design&quot; argument we hear from bible thumpers. The inherent math and potency of the message is astounding. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not sure about the DMT being released in your head when you die thing, I&#39;ve read that&#39;s an urban legend. </p>

<p>The following is all lies:</p>

<p>LSD is a PITA because finding ergot is not the hard part, it&#39;s getting enough ergot to &quot;safely&quot; infect your grain, so that you have a sizable amount to work with, <strong>without losing a fucking limb to gangrene.&quot;</strong> That, and it&#39;s incredibly difficult to accurately make LSD, and not one of 100 analogues near it.</p>

<p>DMT extraction is pretty straight forward. You need an acid, polar and non polar solvents, and time. It can take a long time to leech all the materials you want, from the plant matter.</p>

<p>The most dangerous part (or so I hear...) is making the best solvents for the operation. Chlorine gas is a cunt. Buy high quality masks, and don&#39;t forget to check your filter.</p>

<p>However, you can find DMT fucking everywhere. If I go outside, right now, I can point to 3 plants that contain at least 0.01% DMT, if not more. You can readily harvest enough plant matter to make a few grams of DMT. That should last you a year, or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You inhale 2-3 big puffs. Keep it in as long as possible, you should within seconds feel the on come. This is when you should just sit back and let it happen. Close your eyes and this is when it REALLY starts. Your whole body will tingle and &quot;something&quot; will tell you that something big is gonna happen - JUST LET GO. My experience from this point forward was basically me shooting out of my body at great speed into space. I could actually see myself leaving the atmosphere and going into space. After few seconds of intense visual stimuli - I found myself sitting on a disc? Next moment this red orb hovered closer to me and started showing me scenes. Almost like a movie that is playing at high speeds - I dont know if it was my own future, past or someone else&#39;s. Felt as if I was shown important information so I tried to remember but it is just too fast. Then I could feel the effects wore off and I could feel myself grounding back to my body. This is all happened in like 5mins. </p>

<p>It is one of the most crazy experiences you will ever have. No acid, mushroom trip is anything like it. </p>

<p>Oh, this was also not DMT - it was Changa. Changa is basically the same. Short trip but more intense than DMT - but same basic compound structure. </p>

<a href="https://www.shroomery.org/">https://www.shroomery.org/</a> </p>

<p>I spent months reading these website before I decided to experiment. I did all drugs I could find (except heroin - too scared of needles) for 2-3 years and stopped. Never got addicted, never stole money, never skipped work/family, had a stable job in corporate. Now I just take LSD every 6-8 months to see where I go. </p>

<p>I have encountered a few entities, most of the time they are unlike anything I have ever seen. No definable shape - just almost like essence/energy. Never direct communication. This DMT trip was also my first encounter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it a copout when it&#39;s the truth? When you sleep, different parts of your brain shut-down. When you remember your dreams, enough of your brain was active that you can recall what you were thinking at the time, but so many other parts of your brain were turning off &amp; on that it comes out as nonsensical &amp; you struggle to understand what&#39;s going on &amp; fail. It&#39;s similar to how optical illusions work, or the way we compensate for the blind spot in our eyes. Paranoid schizophrenia is when a person is incapable of identifying anything as being random &amp; meaningless, so they find patterns everywhere, even when none exist.</p>

<p>LSD just adds &quot;noise&quot; to your brain&#39;s processing. It&#39;s like listening to a song you&#39;ve never heard before while white-noise is playing over it. The more of the drug you take, the louder that noise gets &amp; hallucinations are like you botching the lyrics as you try to sing along. Instead of singing, it&#39;s nearly everything your brain does.</p>

<p>Malfunction is a perfectly apt description.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trolling or trying to be mean, I&#39;m trying to help you understand your own mind. You believed <em>something</em> for a long time. Atheists believe in the world existing without magical unexplainable gods, agnostics believe in <em>nothing</em>, unwilling or incapable of forming a belief about the topic.</p>

<p>At some point the belief that material reality is all there is became scary to you, so you ran from it to something more comforting. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because you&#39;re starting to come to terms with your own mortality or what, but fear is the #1 motivator in life.</p>

<p>And, again with the passive-aggressive berating by saying you&#39;re &quot;One peg <strong>up</strong> from agnosticism.&quot; which you imply is above atheism.

    <div class="md"><p>That was not my intention. Having beliefs that differ significantly from the mainstream can be very ostracizing to some people, so an atheist in a rather spiritual/religious community might want to be included or at the very least not demonized for it even if they don&#39;t believe in the things the community does. Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to be labeled an atheist because he doesn&#39;t like the behavior he&#39;s seen of them. Saying &quot;I had a life-changing experience&quot; is usually enough of an excuse for people to say they changed their beliefs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with the cliche of the rebellious teenager who defies their parents rules/orders or beliefs simply to shit-stir, but by that age their beliefs are probably so well ingrained into their mind that it becomes too hard to change for real. And again, once someone has labeled themselves something for long enough they might find it too hard to change without a good excuse.</p>

<p>I knew better than to &quot;profess my atheism&quot; until I had my own place, and a stable job. I did this for reasons you mention. I didn&#39;t want to be ostracized, lose a source of income, and be the living embodiment of the prodigal son parable.</p>

<p>You bring up excellent points to support your argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Atheism is, in the broadest sense, the absence of belief in the existence of deities. Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you arguing that all atheists strongly believe that there are no deities based on no evidence? I would wager most atheists are open to the possibility of there being things greater than us that we don&#39;t understand. It would be highly arrogant and obviously incorrect to assert that our species even remotely understands the true nature of the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>7 dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms in silent darkness was the Red Pill for me.  It established firmly the Self-realization shifting paradigm that in fact our true nature is consciousness.  We are the voice in the dark.  We are the ones who choose.  We are the ones who speak.  We are the ones who create. We are the ones for which every experience is made available. </p>

<p><em>&quot;The particular brain regions that were silenced or disconnected from each other by the drug also provided insight on the nature of psychedelic experience and the therapeutic potential of psilocybin. Two regions that showed the greatest decline in activity were the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).</em></p>

<p><em>The mPFC is an area that, when dysfunctional, is linked with rumination and obsessive thinking. “Probably the most reliable finding in depression is that the mPFC is overactive,” says Carhart-Harris.</em></p>

<p><em>The PCC is thought to play a key role in consciousness and self-identity. “The most intriguing aspect was that the decreases in activity were in specific regions that belong to a network in the brain known as the default network,” notes Carhart-Harris. “There’s a lot of evidence that it’s associated with our sense of self — our ego or personality, who we are.”</em></p>

<p><em>“What’s often said about psychedelic experience is that people experience a temporary dissolution of their ego or sense of being an independent agent with a particular personality,” he says. “Something seems to happen where the sense of self dissolves, and that overlaps with ideas in Eastern philosophy and Buddhism.” This sense of being at one with the universe, losing one’s “selfish” sense and vantage point, and feeling the connectedness of all beings often brings profound peace.&quot;</em>  <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/24/magic-mushrooms-expand-the-mind-by-dampening-brain-activity/">Source</a></p>

<p>Psilocybin  (Psilocin, 4-hydroxy-DMT) actually turns of the majority of the brain as shown by fMRI scans.
Yet we are far more aware, conscious, sober, clear, intuitive, loving, understanding, compassionate and creative. 
Consciousness is non local to this ape body.  Once You realize this, all fear is vanquished forever.  Also Your priorities shift from seeking materialism and accumulation to seeking novel experiences in life. 
The global cabal uses fear and debt to control humanity.  Once fear and desire for petty sense objects is vanquished, You become a Sovereign. 
Sovereign spiritually and intellectually because of establishing a heart (soul) and mind (ego/personality) connection. </p>

<p>We are the all Eternal Individual Consciousness.  The Awoken will create the new set of games and experiences on Earth.  </p>

<p>My vote goes to Venus Project, a Resource Based Economy and becoming a type 2 civilization like the one in Star Trek.  </p>

Psychedelics are the teacher you love because you are both the student and teacher. You learn to have an independent mind which is a dangerous act when it comes to the government. Even though you don&#39;t do anything because you know efforts may be futile, how many others like you are realizing the world for what it is? That&#39;s pretty awesome in itself and soon things will change.

<p>Cathy O&#39;Brien mkultra whistleblower: &quot;Marijuana Disrupts Mind Control Programming&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just had a thought about this. Ever notice how the push for legalization has come at the state level, on a state by state basis? Yet, even while this has been going on, the Federal government has steadfastly continued to pursue and prosecute.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason for this is that, at the state level, they aren&#39;t aware of the real reason why cannabis is illegal. The Feds (and the MkUltra folks) know that cannabis negates their programming. Maybe this is why they still don&#39;t want to legalize even when individual states are doing so?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and I think it&#39;s time that if the government won&#39;t fix their hypocritical legal conflicts, the nonconstitutionality of it; and they want to claim sovereign immunity so you can&#39;t sue--for example--the DEA, then another thing we can consider is this: sue the individuals.</p>

<p>Do individuals that happen to be government employees also have sovereign immunity?  If so, in what type of lawsuits?</p>

<p>Where I&#39;m going with this is: you sue the employees of the DEA, individually&gt;  You sue the director of DEA for making shit decisions.  You sue him for all the reasons you have, throw everything at him.  You make the injuries all the people with the illnesses like cluster headaches or migranes or mental illness that have been on &#39;treatments&#39; that have not worked, costing them time, money, emotional despair, and ---you may not know this but as psychiatric patients are &#39;figuring out their medication&#39;, the different medications can have profoundly behavior-altering effects that can cost those individuals their jobs.</p>

<p>Is the DEA director going to pay for those damages, by class-action, with a potential plaintiff size of millions, with injuries spanning decades?</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking trillions in damages.  An amount neither he nor his family could pay off for thousands of lifetimes.</p>

<p>If this is at all possible, by all means call Erin Brockovich and give her activism steroids and aim her squarely at DC.  I&#39;d say take them all down, even retroactively to past directors and decisions makers in the DEA all the way back to Nixon.  </p>

<p>That movie is incredible to watch stoned.  It is so nuanced and you&#39;ll catch every one.  I thought the movie was good because I was high, so I watched it again for like the 8th time just a few years ago and nope, it&#39;s just a great movie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is undoubtedly a massive conspiracy; the smearing, the injected fear (fear of bad trips, induced schizophrenia and psychosis,) the prison time, the insane confusion between psychedelics and narcotics, opioids, amphetamines etc ... and more.</p>

<p>Psychedelics <strong>will</strong> free your mind if used intelligently, in a personally controlled manner, and therefore not abused.  Marijuana is just a taste of it though.  Salvia, LSD, and Shrooms are advised.</p>

<p>Never met anyone who never came out of their trip (and I know a lot of people that have tripped hard.)  I presume the danger of this happening is close to zero, but I wouldn&#39;t discount it totally.  You should be much more reserved in experimenting if you are confirmed to have &quot;underlying mental problems&quot; whatever that might entail.</p>

But the people most likely to be programmed for some reason or other aren&#39;t exactly up to doing a walkabout or going through prolonged meditation.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that about other drugs, not marijuana so much or opioids since they&#39;ve flooded the nation with that for a &#39;reason.&#39;  If that were true about marijuana Im sure that they would do everything in their power to stop marijuana from becoming legal anywhere if that was the case, unless it&#39;s just another big experiment.. When they started talking about legalizing marijuana I kept thinking &quot;okay so what&#39;s their angle why would they do this, why would they let this happen ? &quot; My conclusion was that they would make marijuana legal Nationwide because it makes people complacent, less prone to resistance if they ever declared martial law or came at people violently, it would pretty much be no contest because the majority of the people would be too high to be a serious problem for them to handle it would actually help them ... I always think about what the other probabilities why they do what they do &amp; it&#39;s never because they&#39;re doing something nice it&#39;s unfortunately always because there&#39;s an angle.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I feel like this is part of that outdated &quot;stoner&quot; stereotype that we&#39;ve become accustomed to over the decades, but I don&#39;t buy that to be true at all. I think it <em>can</em> be true and <em>is</em> true in many cases, but it is hardly the norm. From my experience with pot and from those around me who do it, I&#39;ve seen it have many effects, positive and negative. The &quot;Heyy mannnn&quot; stoner does exist, I believe, but I think it is more from a result of abuse rather than use, and is more related to people who were bound to abuse some substance one way or the other. If they didnt&#39; discover pot, then it would have been alcohol, coke, sex, whatever, pick your addiction.</p>

<p>As for someone like me, I smoke regularly and have been doing so for many years now and I don&#39;t feel any different mentally than I did when I was younger. In fact, I think using pot recreationally, not abusing it, has made me prone to wanting to fight for what I believe in and not letting people run me over. But weed <em>is</em> a drug and it <em>can</em> be abused just like any drug. You have to be smart about it. When done under the right context, I feel that it be greatly beneficial to <em>most</em> people. But everyone is different, and not everyone can handle it like I could. If I had not started using pot, then I don&#39;t feel like I would have the intellectual curiosity that I have now. I love getting high and opening myself up to possible conspiracies, human history, and the future of humanity. I&#39;ll smoke and listen to a lecture because I find that stuff fascinating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the internet isn&#39;t freeing our minds, it&#39;s doing the opposite. try to imagine a world where no one watches TV, reads the newspapers or browses the internet. Completely cut-off living IRL. Whatever bad happens would be known to only neighbours and witnesses on the location and they either will be or won&#39;t be able to sort it out. But millions of people won&#39;t be hearing about that one incident or 100s of such incidents. Everyone will go about their life, work and leisure without any news from unrelated people, except the occasional long distance phone call. I think if this kind of world existed, fewer bad things will happen, because the motive of the people doing the bad-things, i.e. to let the vast majority of their targets know how bad things can be, are or will be, won&#39;t be achieved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can call it a conspiracy, but they&#39;re just drugs. The effect you&#39;re getting is just your body processing the substance and getting that garbage out of it. Whether it&#39;s Sugar, Alcohol, THC, or Psilocybin, it&#39;s poison that needs to be purged, and people get attached to the process of purging it. Every time you take a drug you are processing something -- going through a trip -- and just like being sick it doesn&#39;t end until it&#39;s all out of you.</p>

<p>Cannabis becomes less and less of a psychedelic the more you use it, with chronic use it gets to the point where you&#39;re as dumb as a donkey. Psychedelics become ineffective over time. With so many people embracing cannabis it looks like it&#39;s becoming abundant and legal, THC&#39;s starting to look like the new sugar. Psychedelics are far from being the most illegal drugs, look at heroin and methamphetamine, they cause serious problems for people ...</p>

<p>Now spiritual insight and curing mental illness? I&#39;ll leave you with fasting and meditation. There is no need to use drugs, the real cover-up is that your body is an alchemist that provides you with everything you need. So when you go back to taking comfort in delicious food, mesmerising TV shows, and your favourite websites, and your mind wanders to who&#39;s preventing you from feeling content and complete with nothing more than your next breath, grab a mirror and have a look at the true oppressor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this right. Op didn&#39;t laugh at media manipulation until they had done drugs cause it was then they noticed it?</p>

<p>If that is so drugs and awakening are really not the focus here. You just want to get high. Its OK to admit it. Hell first time I did weed I wanted to get high. I fucking did too. </p>

<p>Then I wanted something more so I did MDMA. Then shrooms, then meth, then ketamine and so on and so fourth. It didn&#39;t awaken me to some truth it made me high which is what I wanted. Worked great too.</p>

<p>This culture of people today just wants to ignore the shitty aspects of reality and need an excuse to ignore it. So you find a reason. You don&#39;t need drugs to have awakening. If you do then you will never be truly enlightened. You will just be a drugie. </p>

<p>Hell I was but quit on my own cause I grew up. Don&#39;t really miss it either. I have a mortgage, insurance payments, and a job. Also have a family to support. That&#39;s where many of you lack that something in your life. You are just self indulgent and need to please yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy both, and feel that they each have something to offer. However, LSD, although a fascinating chemical, being a synthetic makes shrooms undoubtedly more profound in several ways, imo.</p>

<p>The fact that they can be found naturally occurring in the wild and can be picked and eaten as they are really says something insofar as the plant/human dynamic is concerned. Why are they here? Where did they come from? Why does eating them cause most people to have profoundly moving, life-altering spiritual experiences, with long lasting positive psychological effects? Is it just us - are the caribou tripping too? They tend to be a somewhat occulted recurring theme in ancient religious context as well..</p>

<p>Also, when I take a low to medium dose of shrooms, I am infused with an unmistakable feeling of &#39;presence&#39; is the best way I can describe it. A warm, comforting female presence, a &quot;shroom spirit&quot; you might say.  After the trip, I am always left feeling pleasant, with an &quot;everything is as it should be, always was and ever will be&quot; sort of outlook on existence, which is comforting. </p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, at 1/8th (3.5gs) to heroic doses, it is a completely different story. The rollercoaster ride up can be outright scary, and LSD is much gentler in this regard (at least for me) especially because shrooms tends to make me nauseous on the come up. </p>

<p>Acid tends to linger for a while after you&#39;ve come down, personally I enjoy it (lots of laughter, sillyness) but shrooms, poof, they are quickly gone, and it <em>feels</em> like they are 100% out of your system, in fact it is a bit bewildering considering how monumentally fucked up one can be and in a few short moments feel completely sober with shrooms. It is very very clean, in fact, one feels full of vitality after the trip. </p>

<p>I agree fully about tripping in a natural setting. It is the way to go. I can lay back and watch the clouds all day...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always heard about the importance of a calm environment, but now consider this nearly impossible considering our mind is a collection of memories of the past. If we find our lives mostly stressful and unwholesome, how much could a wholesome environment for that one day really help? I would think one would have to immerse oneself in such a calm environment for an extended period of time (while sober) to really be in a truly positive state of mind.</p>

<p>The claim comment never even mentioned any distinction between &quot;bad trips&quot; and &quot;good trips&quot;, just the possibility of tripping for <strong>5+ fucking years</strong>.. it could be bliss for 5 years, how cool would that be?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I&#39;ve always liked your posts on here. I&#39;m happy to oblige.</p>

<p>However, I think I still have one more that I&#39;d like to get out. It concerns a combination of hallucinogens <strong>I DO NOT recommend.</strong> (The dosage of the plant varies wildly, much like Salvia Divinorum. You could follow what I did, to the letter, and overdose and die. I got lucky. I know a few that weren&#39;t as fortunate. I&#39;ve probably caused irrepairable damage to my heart from what I did.)</p>

<p>So I begin:</p>

<p>As the human mind flexes, forever searching for a nexus (probably around the solar plexus) it decides upon a route, that is overgrown with doubt, but I have my friend, the trout.</p>

<p>So mix as I do. A little of the common leaf, to serve as a base, a bit of lotophagi&#39;s delight, to brighten up my face, finally the emerald sorceress, her plant has no place. But upon this night, her I do embrace.</p>

<pre><code>Fire cleanses as it consumes. See through my work as it spews.
Now hold it close and don&#39;t let go. Keep it there so you will know.
</code></pre>

<p>Once, twice, thrice, did I kiss, but something seemed amiss.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t any different. Did I do something wrong. Perhaps I should&#39;ve used a bong. I will wait, but how long.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>And as I sat in solitude, my ears picked up a queer tune.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Maynard should be wailing loud, but... what is with... the crowd.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>50s big band music feels &quot;my room.&quot; But I am not there.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;This is not my room.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>No one else seems to care. In fact, they scare! Without faces anywhere!?
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Oh fuck, what have I done. I&#39;m not here with anyone.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I see, as in, I can only see the large dance hall that was once my bedroom.
Inside, humanoid creatures twist and loom. Greyscale, no color in bloom.
I fear my world is closing in. In a panic I look again.
</code></pre>

<p>I see the most beautiful woman, in a golden dress, dancing in my room. Where once was grey, green has taken hold. She wears a mask of abyssal darkness. To me, she looks.</p>

<pre><code>I hear nothing. But I hear her question.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Accusingly, yet pleasant.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;This is my room. Why are you here.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Without a word she spins in dance, and vanishes from my glance. I look around the room, and see my old bedroom.</p>

<p><em>&quot;... comes back around, to show you everything. Let&#39;s you choose what you will not see and then Drags you down like a stone, or lifts you up again. Spits you out like a child, light and innocent...&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve tripped many times, but never have I been unable to make something go away, at will. That was real. Too real.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I retire to the implied safety of the adjoining, smokey room.
I am relieved to see it has not changed.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Why am <strong>I</strong> here? Why are you in my room?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>As the brain counts change, trying to make sense, I feel estranged, from my common sense.
As I ponder, into my room did wander, a treat for the eyes.
For as I look about, I perceive a scorpion, of enormous size.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;FUCK!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I leap from the chair, and secure a baseball bat. But OMG where is it at!??!
I scan around the room, certain of my doom, when it reveals itself.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;DIE!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>I strike truly, but to my dismay, the little bastard, got away.
In an instant I receive his riposte. I feel the stinger pierce my skin.
Searing pain... Must escape... 
</code></pre>

<p>I fall onto the dance floor, hard wood. Smells like pine, though. I look back unable to find the room I just left.</p>

<pre><code>Dread is my friend, for he stays with me, regardless of my wishes.
Oh to have my trout friend. I don&#39;t get stung by fishes.
</code></pre>

<p>But experience, preparation, and training save me.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;That&#39;s it. Breathe in... and out... In... and out...&quot;
&quot;This is not real. I am under the influence of a mind altering substance.&quot;
&quot;This is not real. I am okay. I am fine. Everything will be okay.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I repeat my mantra to keep sane. The scorpion escapes back to the aetheral plane, from which it came. I no longer feel its imparted pain. But upon a wooden floor, I sit. The situation, it does not fit. For my room is carpeted, and this new place is... not... real...</p>

<pre><code>A host of green, to complacent to be mean, make quite a scene.
Dancing across the floor, never daring to get too near a door, I sit and watch... unexpected gore?
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Why are you here?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>She has returned, but golden lace, has been replaced, with a rotting face, her mask, displaced.
I do not answer, instead I swear. Am I still in my underwear?
</code></pre>

<p>Like some twisted Michael Jackson video, faceless humanoids dance, zombie-like, jerking to and fro. They ignore me completely, only the woman acknowledges me. In some carnal ritual they begin devouring eachother, ripping flesh and limb with tooth and nail.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I think I was doing better with the scorpion.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Again I wander from the dance, still in my underpants, but when I arrive I am in a trance.</p>

<pre><code>I look at my surrounding, as my fears are drowning. Bigger still, everything gets. Shrinking, am I, to the size of my pets.
Like little Alice did before, I must do, once more. What potion did I quaff? Why do I feel un-safe?
Without missing a beat, my next foe desires to meet. And as I lose my mind, I pray that I will go blind.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Spiders made of serpents? WTF are you?&quot;</p>

<pre><code>&quot;What happens if he repents?&quot;
&quot;Another soul for you.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>As I have surely lost my mind, a moment of clarity, do I find. Somewhere deep behind, a whisper, a child.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Piper can save you.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>And so I try. I do not eat it, so gross it makes me cry. So instead it sizzles, to burn and fry.</p>

<pre><code>Hurry up. Hurry up. I donh wanth... to...
</code></pre>

<p>So hard to sit. I am so heavy. So very heavy. Like planets crashing into one another. I am gravity.</p>

<pre><code>Spidews, burble, donh wanth... noth real... Imth fine...
</code></pre>

<p>I lose consciousness.</p>

<p>I awoke the next day, on the floor of the adjacent room. Tool&#39;s lateralus was still on loop. My baseball bat survived. No more hallucinations that could not be dismissed, disbelieved. Never again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it a copout when it&#39;s the truth? When you sleep, different parts of your brain shut-down. When you remember your dreams, enough of your brain was active that you can recall what you were thinking at the time, but so many other parts of your brain were turning off &amp; on that it comes out as nonsensical &amp; you struggle to understand what&#39;s going on &amp; fail. It&#39;s similar to how optical illusions work, or the way we compensate for the blind spot in our eyes. Paranoid schizophrenia is when a person is incapable of identifying anything as being random &amp; meaningless, so they find patterns everywhere, even when none exist.</p>

<p>LSD just adds &quot;noise&quot; to your brain&#39;s processing. It&#39;s like listening to a song you&#39;ve never heard before while white-noise is playing over it. The more of the drug you take, the louder that noise gets &amp; hallucinations are like you botching the lyrics as you try to sing along. Instead of singing, it&#39;s nearly everything your brain does.</p>

<p>Malfunction is a perfectly apt description.</p>
