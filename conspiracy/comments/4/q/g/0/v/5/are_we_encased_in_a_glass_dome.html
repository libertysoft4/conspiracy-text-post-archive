        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about flat earth/hollow earth/globe earth and the arguments for each.</p>

<p>One topic that is often overlooked is the question of what is actually up there. Is there a glass dome, or just the vacuum of space?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching videos of people making rainbows indoors.</p>

<p>Both videos I&#39;ve found, involve using a mirror and water:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXccpwytjL8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXccpwytjL8</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp81xT7_bQY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp81xT7_bQY</a></p>

<p>We can see with our own eyes that rainbows form in the sky when it rains, which provides the water.</p>

<p>But where does the mirror come from?</p>

<p>According to mainstream science, rainbows are formed by light bouncing off the inside of <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/Lesson-4/Rainbow-Formation">raindrops.</a></p>

<p>If this were true, how come we can&#39;t make a rainbow with a water hose <strong>indoors</strong>?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen videos of rainbows being made with a water hose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m_sYGKZyQ">outdoors</a>, but never indoors.</p>

<p>Perhaps the light bounces off the glass dome surrounding the earth and then bounces off the water when it rains...</p>

<p>To answer your question of why no-one has a video of a rainbow being made with a hose, indoors... Ask your folks if you can do it in their house.

failing that, do it in your own home and film the results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a tough one to answer.  I wish I knew.</p>

<p>I suspect there are entry/exit points at the poles, and I also imagine that there are many &quot;cells&quot; like ours.  </p>

<p>The Nazi&#39;s endorsed a &quot;swiss cheese&quot; model of the universe meaning that there are many many holes in the universe and we exist in just one of them.  This leads some to believe they actually did find a way out of this world we live in, and they left their main propaganda agents behing to perpetuate the idea that the Nazi&#39;s lost and to prop up the space program to discourage others from finding the truth.  This is a little off topic from your question but I thought you might find it interesting.  </p>

<p>If you look into the deepest holes ever dug, you find the Russians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">Kola superdeep bore hole.</a>  It reached 12km after a year, and then failed to make anymore progress in the following two years and ultimately gave up.  </p>

<p>That is sort of paranormal/supernatural if you ask me.  Why wouldn&#39;t we be able to make it past 12km?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t even create equipment that can penetrate the crust.  We have yet to actually reach the mantle that we are told absolutely exists.</p>

<p>Also, sampling from the borehole did not show that the rock was more dense as they dug deeper, and there was even water present at depths beyond where water should be able to exist.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To scientists, one of the more fascinating findings to emerge from this well is that no transition from granite to basalt was found at the depth of about 7 km, where the velocity of seismic waves has a discontinuity. Instead the change in the seismic wave velocity is caused by a metamorphic transition in the granite rock. In addition, the rock at that depth had been thoroughly fractured and was saturated with water, which was surprising. This water, unlike surface water, must have come from deep-crust minerals and had been unable to reach the surface because of a layer of impermeable rock.</p>

However, Islam is praised and they are more devout to Allah than most Christians are to God/Jesus.</p>

<p>TPTB don&#39;t want us dead.  They cannot obtain unfathomable wealth without slaves to build their empire.  However, in order to mask their own existence, they train us all to hate downward, meaning that we are trained to hate the entitled, the poor, minorities, rather than rally with them against the oppressors that hold us all down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but these overlords profit from wars and incarceration.  It is order out of chaos.  (Much like the big bang theory.)  It keeps them safe when we are at each other&#39;s throats.  Keep in mind there are way less of them then there are of us.  We must not direct our attention towards them for their own safety. </p>

<p>Also keep in mind that these overlords believe eugenics and that the world is overpopulated.  They don&#39;t want to kill us all, but anytime they can force us to kill each other it accomplishes one of their objectives without any action on their part.  They also believe in Social Darwinism, and believe stupidity and ignorance is a sin, so these manufactured wars (not just between countries but between classes as well) help them determine who the stupid people are and it is their belief that these people deserve to die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well remember that I endorse the concave model, so I don&#39;t think that organic beings are traveling here from other planets.  </p>

<p>Yeah I guess demons are closer.  Beings that exist beyond our limited scope of perception.  Perhaps they are the makers of this world.  Perhaps they use us as some sort of energy source that depends on our suffering?  It&#39;s really hard to say, but I do believe that higher intelligence and higher realms exist.  I do believe that certain people can channel information from these realms.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah it wouldn&#39;t be outer it would be inner space.  The planets would be smaller than earth, and although they may still be spherical, I don&#39;t believe they are solid masses that we can stand on.  It sort of explains the Fermi paradox if you think about it.  </p>

<p>Aliens haven&#39;t reached us because the only surface that can harbor organic life is the surface of the earth.  The universe is electric and completely contained within the inner celestial sphere.</p>

<p>I still think there are satellites, but they aren&#39;t orbiting around us, they are orbiting the sphere within the enclosed earth.  </p>

<p>Man&#39;s greatest attempts to dig through the crust have only reached 12km.  I mentioned this in an earlier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4qg0v5/are_we_encased_in_a_glass_dome/d4sp5ut">comment.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they use seismology and sonar as proof.  No man has ever reached the mantle.  When they dug that Kola Superdeep borehole they found a number of things that contradicted their expectations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to find out for sure.  My ultimate goal is truth whatever it may be.</p>

<p>I mean if I found out for sure that the concave earth theory is correct, it would bring me comfort.  It would mean we serve a higher purpose and that it isn&#39;t over when we die.  It means there is a greater understanding out there that can be achieved.  It means that our actions are likely being observed.  </p>

<p>Do you see how it would be reassuring?</p>

<p>I mean an alternative is that we are being harvested as an energy source by some sort of parasitic extra dimensional beings, but even then, we aren&#39;t just completely meaningless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be leery of TPTB putting the clamp down if you discovered THE truth. Obviously they&#39;ll go to lengths to keep it hidden if that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>As far as comfort of a higher power, I think once enough anecdotal evidence reaches a certain point concerning God&#39;s existence - which it certainly has in my book - coupled with my own thoughts, experiences and beliefs, I know we&#39;re here for a purpose. It&#39;s just that purpose if countered with a demonic/fallen angel/metaphysical trickster detour plan.</p>

<p>Not to sidetrack, but the limited free will I believe God gave all humans is at play here. He doesn&#39;t force us to choose His path for us, but rather lets us choose between His way and the world&#39;s way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then we agree.  I think it is sort of preposterous to look around and deduce that this is all random.  </p>

<p>I also think you are right, IMO right now our world is rearing it&#39;s ugly head and it&#39;s our job to remain loving and to serve others and to seek truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about where the radio waves aren&#39;t blocked by the celestial sphere? From a broadcasting antenna, the radio waves go out in all directions. Some will go directly &quot;up&quot; towards the celestial sphere, but others will pass the celestial sphere. Others will reflect and bounce past the celestial sphere.</p>

<p>The celestial sphere would have to be at quite a low altitude to avoid this. Probably low enough that aircraft would crash into it.</p>
