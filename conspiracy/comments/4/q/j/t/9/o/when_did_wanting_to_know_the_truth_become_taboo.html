It seems the more shootings/terrorism happen the less we are affected. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t care, it&#39;s that we are just... numb. The more often something happens the more normal it becomes. I feel like this is exactly what is happening with Clinton. I used to be massively angry at every new discovery that was coming out and as it&#39;s getting closer to possible indictment I feel more and more numb. How did we get here and how can we possibly win against this mind control? When did wanting to know the truth become taboo?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only question that you have that I can answer is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When did wanting to know the truth become taboo?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is 1967.</p>

<p>Origin of the term Conspiracy Theory.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Crimes_Against_Democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Crimes_Against_Democracy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967.[20] The program was directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize “conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and judgments. The CIA told its contacts that “parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conspiracy theory,</p>

<p>A contemptuous term used primarily by the main stream media to slander anyone who questions their monopoly on truth.[1] 
<a href="http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html">http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html</a></p>

<p>In 1967, the CIA Created the Label &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; ... to Attack Anyone Who Challenges the &quot;Official&quot; Narrative</p>

<p>“Conspiracy Theory”: Foundations of a Weaponized Term
Subtle and Deceptive Tactics to Discredit Truth in Media and Research
<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/conspiracy-theory-foundations-of-a-weaponized-term/5319708">http://www.globalresearch.ca/conspiracy-theory-foundations-of-a-weaponized-term/5319708</a></p>

<p>The mind control came into being when Edward Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud, working for Chesterfield cigarettes, had &#39;experts&#39; publicly call  for women to smoke cigarettes , calling them &quot;torches of freedom&#39;. Women by the millions took up smoking.</p>

<p>Bernays wrote the book on propaganda  which has been solidly proven to work. Governments around the world have used his system ever since. Just have experts repeat whatever you want people to believe  and they will take it as the final truth since &#39;experts&#39; have already done the research for them. They have no need to look into the truth themselves, its already decided by the experts. So &#39;experts&#39; in news and politics can manipulate the public into any belief that is good for the powers that be,  without worrying about a plurality of opinion going against their statements.</p>

<p>Some of us will be immune to such manipulation but then there is the term &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;  to keep us ineffective.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a copy/ paste from my earlier comments about Bernays,</p>

<p>&#39;People will believe absolutely anything that&#39;s  repeated to them by &#39;experts&#39; no matter how implausible.&#39;</p>

<p>Edward Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud who outlined the categories of of both Public Relations and Propaganda found that people could be reliably manipulated by the simple method of having &#39;experts&#39; repeat any idea in the media. He proved this while working for Chesterfield Cigarettes by causing millions of women to start smoking.</p>

<p>That idea has been documented to work spectacularly and repeatedly since the 1920&#39;s.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s his book explaining his invention of propaganda in pdf format.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great response. Few additions.</p>

<p>Here is the CIA doc #1035-969 that defines &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;;
<a href="http://thewebfairy.com/masonic/cia_document.htm">http://thewebfairy.com/masonic/cia_document.htm</a></p>

<p>Important to note that this memo was sent to MSM news outlets instructing them on how to &#39;deal&#39; with those pesky Truth seekers. Here is some selected text from the Memo:</p>

<p>&quot;To discuss the publicity problem with [?] and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors), pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics are without serious foundation, and that further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition. Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.</p>

<p>b. To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should pro- vide useful background material for passing to assets. Our ploy should point out, as applicable, that the critics are</p>

<p>(I) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in,
(II) politically interested,
(III) financially interested,
(IV) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or
(V) infatuated with their own theories.&quot;</p>

<p>Bernay&#39;s &#39;Propaganda&#39; is critical to understanding how the world works. </p>

<p>I also would highly recommend Aldous Huxley. In particular the talk below, and his book Brave New World Revisited. (Huxley was an insider).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RX-iUfPJ9I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RX-iUfPJ9I</a></p>

<p>In the above Huxley explains how 20% of any population are easily hypnotized, 60% are moderately susceptible to hypnotism, and 20% are basically immune to it.</p>

<p>To the original poster we are here because of a whole host of Mind Control techniques being used constantly through all forms of media; print, radio, TV/Film, Internet. So the first step is to stop exposing yourself to the media. Just because you are aware of Mind Control techniques does not make you immune from their affects. There are many methods and layers of it in modern societies.</p>

<p>The Truth has always been taboo. All Systems of Control (Government, Religion, Education, Law, Finance, etc.) employ some level of deception in order to manipulate the populace. And the above systems are 1000&#39;s of years old. What is different today is the sheer scale (mass media and worldwide) of deception being employed, corruption so large it can no longer be hidden, unsustainable systems hitting their breaking point (Central Banking fiat Ponzi scheme), and add to that the Internet which has helped expose and spread the Truth.</p>

<p>The Truth is only taboo to those who benefit from deception. There is currently (and arguably always has been) a War on Truth. And certainly one tactic is try and make the Truth taboo. What is different is because of the Internet, this &#39;War on Truth&#39;, is plainly visible and easy to find for those who wish to see.</p>

<p>Look at the most profitable legal drugs... the top one is a heart-disease related one, the second is one for after a heart attack, the third is for acid reflux disease (or eating lots of shitty food), the fourth is for asthma and COPD (lovely air we breathing eh?) the sixth, seventh, AND eighth most profitable? anti-psychotics.</p>

<p>...but here is how 9/11 went down, some 19 crazy Muslim fanatics hijacked four airliners tunnelled one underground, one crashed into the Pentagon, then two flow into two skyscrapers which collapsed three steel framed skyscrapers, WTC7 collapsed at actual freefall for 2.25 seconds out of pure sympathy.</p>

<p>We then found the mastermind 10 years or so later, murdered him and dumped his body in the ocean <strong>out of respect</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even earlier, it started with the Fall of Constantinople, since that is when &quot;Truth&quot; has been moved into central Europe.</p>

<p>1517 is the time when &quot;Truth&quot; reached critical Mass and widespread coverage due to printing press.</p>

<p>So you see, it took &quot;Truth&quot; 64 years to create it&#39;s own resistance army.</p>

<p>We&#39;re now 30 years into the 2nd Reformation (internet discovery) and all ready the Resistance movement is formed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what form the next war will take , but i know it will be brutal and i know that if we don&#39;t set our objective to Abolish the central banking system and abolish International Groups (WTO , IMF, BIS etc) that war would be meaningless and a waste of life , a waste of time and our war to lose.</p>

<p>I disagree.  Most people, as long as they have a job, food, and entertainment, do not care about anything else.  Why should they when they are content with that?  The very small minority are the inquisitive types that long to see the big picture while also holding onto the minutiae.  One can only hope that the latter band together enough to get the ball of change moving until it hits a tipping point.  Only then will everyone begin to care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it has been a long time coming, but looking back it seems like shouting down truth seekers was really ratcheted up during Bush&#39;s first term. It became so easy to call someone a traitor or unpatriotic if someone questioned just about anything that came out of DC.  </p>

<p>Now what do we have to show for it, our (major network) &quot;journalists&quot; just read statements and memos released by the government without questioning the content. The only people who question what is said only do so if the memo is from someone or a group from an opposing political party.  </p>
