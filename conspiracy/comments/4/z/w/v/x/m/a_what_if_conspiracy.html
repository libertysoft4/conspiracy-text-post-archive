    <div class="md"><p>Putin is not playing the game right. He should be making his country hate Americans, but the fool is pointing at the American government and our corrupt political system.</p>

<p>To further a plan where he is in collusion, it would be much more effective to isolate his people from the West. I&#39;ve got a lot of friends in software who are from both Russia and the former USSR.</p>

<p>We know too much about Russian society, and dialogue is too free to make his stance compatible with the Hegelian dialectic. China, on the other hand... is an easier sell. It could be that Russia is out of the loop, and China and the West are colluding.</p>

<p>I only know a few Chinese people, and it appears that they have their press locked down. They are quite insular, and that would fit the narrative quite well.</p>

<p>The USSR looks like it may have been in collusion with the west in a Strategy of Tension, but that might have broken down when the wall fell.</p>

<p>Russia could be a country that is trying to recover from being in the grips of the international movers, just as we are. Glasnost and perestroika seem to be against the global agenda, in the way they occurred.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep my eyes open, though :)</p>

<p>Their central bank Presidents meet up one night every 2 months to discuss what will happen to us all, next. Their power is that they control all of the money. There is no greater power than that.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s proof of their being &#39;in bed&#39; together.</p>

<p>As members of the BIS they are not real competitors against their fellow members.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have almost perfected mind control. Watch a DAARPA talk on mind matters. They can already put memorys in our brains and we would believe them to be real. Imagine when they match that with radio frequencys. They could convince us to believe whatever they chose. They even spoke of being able to take brainactivity from criminals and psychopaths and look for it in children. The man who spoke about it even suggested doing something about that child might be something to consider......</p>

<p>Clones are definately possible. I heard a rosswell conspiracy that was incredibly convincing even though it was a bit out there. Thats strangefor me because I usually stick to critical thinking conspiracys as opposed to belief and speculation. But it was a very convincing explanation.</p>

<p>I have also heard the alien life returning theory. I believe they have anti grav from nazis. I think the idea has merit and it would be a brillant idea as most people, especially UFO&#39;ers would fall for it. Then they can rule the world through these &quot;benevolent&quot; aliens.</p>
