<p><strong>The date and location of the speech</strong>:</p>

<p>Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York City
April 27, 1961</p>

<p>That was a speech right after the Bay of Pigs invasion. </p>

<p>April 17, 1961 – April 19, 1961</p>

<p>Where the USA tried to launch a full scale invasion of Cuba, and it failed
because the Soviets and Cubans knew they were going to attack. And the 
invading forces were badly outnumbered. </p>

<p>It was a monumental failure on the part of the USA. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13066561">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13066561</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/bay-of-pigs-invasion">http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/bay-of-pigs-invasion</a></p>

<p>This speech is him talking to the press after the failed invasion,
and basically asking them to keep certain machinations and movements
of the US government secret from the citizens. </p>

<p>The Bay of Pigs invasion failure it what prompted him to say what he did. To quote
his speech directly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. <strong>The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some</strong>; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--<strong>for reducing this threat or living with it</strong>--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.</p>

<p><strong>This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements</strong> of direct concern both to the press and to the President--two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, <strong>first, to the need for a far greater public information</strong>; and, <strong>second, to the need for far greater official secrecy</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So right there he is asking the press for greater official secrecy. Then he goes on about how we are opposed to secret oaths, proceedings, and societies. And to quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The very word &quot;secrecy&quot; is repugnant in a free and open society</strong>; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.</p>

<p><strong>But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation</strong> to reexamine his own standards, and to recognize the nature of our country&#39;s peril. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort based largely on self-discipline, to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of &quot;clear and present danger,&quot; the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public&#39;s need for national security.</p>

<p><strong>Today no war has been declared</strong>--and however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe. The survival of our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared, no borders have been crossed by marching troops, no missiles have been fired.</p>

<p><strong>If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security</strong>. If you are awaiting a finding of &quot;clear and present danger,&quot; then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read the entire transcript for yourself, he is clearly asking the press to censor the news in light of the Soviet Communist expansions. 
The Cold War. </p>

<p>But context is always important, because snippets of a speech with entire paragraphs and 14 minutes removed. 
Well, that&#39;s not truth, it&#39;s misinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking once again about context. </p>

<p>Kennedy said, they conduct the Cold War. </p>

<p>He was clearly referencing the Eastern Bloc Powers, 
meaning the Soviets and communist countries. </p>

<p>Which makes sense because this speech was right after the Bay of Pigs invasion failure. </p>

<p>And less than a year before the Cuban Missile Crisis. </p>

<p>Context sets up meaning. </p>

<p>A speech means nothing without the context of it&#39;s meaning. </p>

<p>Official historical description:</p>

<p>Description:
This folder contains a press copy and a reading copy of President Kennedy&#39;s address to the American Newspaper Publishers Association at a Bureau of Advertising dinner held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. In his speech President Kennedy addresses his discontent with the press&#39;s news coverage before, during, and after the Bay of Pigs incident, suggesting that there is a need for &quot;far greater public information&quot; and &quot;far greater official secrecy.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s a speech about communism and the soviets. </p>

<p>His speech was never about the Illuminati, the speech didn&#39;t &quot;get him killed&quot;. I&#39;m addressing the meme of this belief. </p>

<p>Some fucker edited the audio clip, cut out the context and entire points inbetween sentences. </p>

<p>It became an internet meme. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s a bullshit one. </p>

<p>And people refuse to believe otherwise even when presented with ALL the information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just like to mention that while this Speech is attributed to JFK&#39;s view on the Soviets and the press, he made it right after the Bay of Pigs which was an operation that would have never happened had JFK gone with the original plan: OPERATION NORTHWOODS. Now, taking into context that JFK had just shot down the US government after they were attempting to perpetuate a false flag... I would be more than happy to bet that he IS talking about a ruthless and monolithic conspiracy, and that those conspirators were close to home. Some times a sentence/paragraph/speech can have two meanings, and I think we were all getting the same type of warning from JFK that we got from Eisenhower during his &quot;Military Industrial Complex&quot; speech. </p>

<p>The paragraph before it. Remember he is giving this speech to the press and journalists
at a dinner gala held for them. This speech is directed solely at the press. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years.

</blockquote>

<p><strong>So right there he is asking the press for greater official secrecy. Then he goes on about how we are opposed to secret oaths, proceedings, and societies. And to quote</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then he reiterated the need for official secrecy by emphasizing the expansion of Communism. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>There were TWO SIDES to the cold war.  One of those sides was also coming from within the US government; more specifically the national security state.  </p>

<p>Every time in every post on this topic I have read from you could also be referring to the CIA/Security State apparatus, which was an enormous concern of JFKs.  Every time you say &quot;communism&quot; or &quot;USSR&quot;, just replace with &quot;CIA&quot; and you can make the same argument.</p>

The site was a remote swampy area on the southern coast of Cuba, where a night landing might bring a force ashore against little resistance and help to hide any U.S. involvement. Unfortunately, the landing site also left the invading force more than 80 miles from refuge in Cuba&#39;s Escambray Mountains, if anything went wrong.</p>

<p>That&#39;s more garbage: Here is David Talbot, author of &quot;The Devil&#39;s Chessboard&quot; talking about the situation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But they had this very acrimonious split over CIA-led invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, where Kennedy felt he had been lied to and sandbagged, and forced into supporting this invasion. I think that the plan all along was the CIA had wanted the invasion to fail, but Dulles hoped and was completely convinced that Kennedy would be forced to send in the full might of the U.S. military to save the invasion and to crush Castro. When Kennedy didn’t do that and refused to escalate it into an international crisis, it provoked this split within the Kennedy government that led to Dulles being forced out of power, much to his shock. He had never been treated that way by a president).</p>

<p>You really need to stop citing disinfo sites.</p>

<p>Here is Russ Baker&#39;s article on disinfo sources.</p>

<p>Further noted, and I&#39;m pretty sure they are related, is that the Carlyle Group acquired the JFK Library... <a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/2014/06/29/carlyle-groups-latest-acquisition-the-jfk-library/">http://whowhatwhy.org/2014/06/29/carlyle-groups-latest-acquisition-the-jfk-library/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet, consider this: The ultimate globe-girdling corporation is playing a major role in preserving the memory of a president who at the time of his death was engaged in what may be described as mortal combat with outfits not unlike Carlyle—if smaller and less global. (I write about this in my book Family of Secrets but you can learn a lot more about JFK versus the corporations in Donald Gibson’s Battling Wall Street: The Kennedy Presidency.)</p>

<p>Kennedy was locked in grim battle with oil and steel and banking interests, hated by mining giants and soda pop companies, resisting pressures from the burgeoning defense industry, and on and on. The list of the offending and the aggrieved was endless. Executives were taking out ads to excoriate him, and even showing up at the White House to practically spit in his face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kennedy was a figurehead of the northeast and national security establishment until the Cuban Missile crisis changed his mind in &#39;63.  Only then did he fight back against the CIA.</p>

<p>This speech was clearly, as OP shows, a way to get the press to censor the news.</p>

<p>He&#39;s saying that the enemy: communism, is a global conspiracy, and therefore the only way to fight it is with secrecy.  Though the American press traditionally valued openness, Kennedy is saying that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; - Soviet communism - is too well organized and we&#39;ll have to censor the news to win against it.</p>

<p>The quote you posted is what Kennedy is trying to accuse communism of, to convince the U.S. press that fighting such an enemy requires giving up its own values.</p>

<p>When we look at operation mockingbird, we see this come to fruition.  This is a smoking gun, not about a U.S. illuminati, but about how the U.S. civil society sold out its values in the name of war and power.</p>

To make it seem as if Kennedy somehow is against this ruthless conspiracy he addresses is flipping the meaning of the speech, he is asking the media not to report on his mistakes. The Kennedy family is one of the bloodlines that goes back the furthest, along with the other 12 bloodlines of billionaires. You should understand that these families go way back, and have been colluding to rip off the 99% for centuries including faking news events, hoaxes, getting us into wars, and bailing out banks and corporations that actively break our constitution.</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>This folder contains a press copy and a reading copy of President Kennedy&#39;s address to the American Newspaper Publishers Association at a Bureau of Advertising dinner held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. In his speech President Kennedy addresses his discontent with the press&#39;s news coverage before, during, and after the Bay of Pigs incident, suggesting that there is a need for &quot;far greater public information&quot; and &quot;far greater official secrecy.&quot; </p>

<p>The facts and context are clear.  During this speech Kennedy is supporting the national security state and asking for censorship.</p>

<p>Kennedy started as a figurehead of the elite, but his mind changed after the missile crisis.  He did a 180 and was assassinated.  This speech was before that.</p>

<p>His change of heart occurred after the Cuban missile crisis a year or two later.  He didn&#39;t start dismantling the CIA until then, so your timing&#39;s off.</p>

<p>But forget timing.  The speech is about censoring the news because communism&#39;s a big &quot;conspiracy&quot;.  That is what it is about.  Your interpretation of it doesn&#39;t match the speech at all.</p>

<p>But shillery, don&#39;t worry, your tactics won&#39;t work because people can read both our comments and see the plain facts for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after his inauguration, in February 1961, <strong>President Kennedy authorized the invasion plan. But he was determined to disguise U.S. support. The landing point at the Bay of Pigs was part of the deception</strong>. The site was a remote swampy area on the southern coast of Cuba, where a night landing might bring a force ashore against little resistance and help to hide any U.S. involvement. Unfortunately, the landing site also left the invading force more than 80 miles from refuge in Cuba&#39;s Escambray Mountains, if anything went wrong.</p>

<p>But they had this very acrimonious split over CIA-led invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, where Kennedy felt he had been lied to and sandbagged, and forced into supporting this invasion. I think that the plan all along was the CIA had wanted the invasion to fail, but Dulles hoped and was completely convinced that Kennedy would be forced to send in the full might of the U.S. military to save the invasion and to crush Castro. When Kennedy didn’t do that and refused to escalate it into an international crisis, it provoked this split within the Kennedy government that led to Dulles being forced out of power, much to his shock. He had never been treated that way by a president).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet, consider this: The ultimate globe-girdling corporation is playing a major role in preserving the memory of a president who at the time of his death was engaged in what may be described as mortal combat with outfits not unlike Carlyle—if smaller and less global. (I write about this in my book Family of Secrets but you can learn a lot more about JFK versus the corporations in Donald Gibson’s Battling Wall Street: The Kennedy Presidency.)</p>

<p>Kennedy was locked in grim battle with oil and steel and banking interests, hated by mining giants and soda pop companies, resisting pressures from the burgeoning defense industry, and on and on. The list of the offending and the aggrieved was endless. Executives were taking out ads to excoriate him, and even showing up at the White House to practically spit in his face.</p>

<p>And when the group the CIA put on the beach of Cuba started getting beaten, Dulles thought that would force Kennedy&#39;s hand and make him bring in the american military for air support and kick off an out and out war with the Russians.</p>

<p>Another little known fact, is that we also sponsored a coup in France just a few days later which also failed, but the evidence linking it to the CIA was not as strong. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_putsch_of_1961">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_putsch_of_1961</a> and <a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/2015/10/20/jfk-assassination-plot-mirrored-in-1961-france-part-1/">http://whowhatwhy.org/2015/10/20/jfk-assassination-plot-mirrored-in-1961-france-part-1/</a> Kennedy, who spoke with de Gaulle during this, was to have offered his military support to help him but &quot;could not account for his own CIA&quot; or something very similar.</p>

<p>To out and out say he is talking about communism and the soviets is foolish considering he and Bobby were working on building a dialog with the soviets.</p>

<p>Kennedy&#39;s enemy was his own CIA and this sounds more like a plea to get the press on his side rather than spouting CIA propaganda.</p>

<p>Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst had this to say: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/">http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, John Kennedy had problems of the same kind, and he fired Dulles. And that was a no-no. You don’t fire people like Dulles. Kennedy embarked on a new course. He talked with Khrushchev, he had people, interlocutors, who talked with Castro, and, worst of all, he issued two executive orders, saying that 1,000 U.S troops would be pulled out of Vietnam by the end of 1963 and the bulk of the rest by 1965. He was going to give up Southeast Asia to the Commies, and God knows what would happen next with the dominoes falling and Indonesia, and my God… So he was killed by the “deep state.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he was the President, and he had obligations. </p>

<p>The Soviet Union was a threat to the interests of the United States, he was Commander in Chief, that was his role. 
Listening and reading that speech I can only say he was asking the press to find a good middle ground so America&#39;s advances against the U.S.S.R. aren&#39;t compromised. That is a reasonable request.</p>

<p>His presentation seems to suggest as well that in competing with the enemy, the values that have founded the United States must not be sacrificed. He asked the media to be reserved in what news they publish.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with everything the United States government is doing today but this was over 50 years ago. The U.S. has been the globes only superpower for over 25 years now and the U.S.S.R. has long been dissolved. Although the Soviet Union fell apart, America still seems to continue as if the cold war never ended, it&#39;s a totally different beast today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting post. I think it&#39;s clear JFK is calling for measured censorship from American news publishers when dealing with delicate Cold War information.</p>

<p>Of course, it can seem like JFK is instead speaking of an Illuminati that was out to kill him if you believe in The Conspiracy (which I do). But don&#39;t fall into that trap.</p>

<p>Not everything about the JFK administration is clouded by the conspiracy. I&#39;m not even sure how much he knew he was a target. He was a fatalist, but in the end he kept going about his job as if things were normal. Would he really make a speech about the Illuminati to the public? </p>

<p>(It wasn&#39;t an &quot;Illuminati&quot; by the way. It was just a few Vietnam hawk hardliners and a fired spook deputy.)</p>

<p>But no.  Too many people on this sub are too far down the rabbit hole.  They haven&#39;t come out the other side yet, so they think everything is a conspiracy and no matter what proof you show them to the contrary they will simply refuse to accept it.  They will deny it is legit.  </p>

<p>Look, this kind of idea has been around forever.  People on youtube 6 years ago were trying to push this garbage.  JFK wasn&#39;t NOT pushing to have the AZC registered as a foreign entity.  He was talking about something that was intentionally hidden.  People knew and understand what communism meant and what it represented.

    <div class="md"><p>That is the context of the speech.  The other poster at the top has it correct.  JFK talking about a ruthless conspiracy IS what we&#39;re talking about.  I have listened to the speech many times.  I won&#39;t take your single view on it because there is MORE happening at this time during JFK&#39;s presidency than you are talking about.  It&#39;s not <em>just</em> about this one speech alone.</p>

<p>That is what I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally see it as a reference to the CIA, Mobsters, Bankers, Tycoons that were running everything behind the scenes and who he ended up going head to head with. Remember it was these same globalist elites that organised the cold war. Kennedy knew these people and knew what they were upto.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate people like you so much. &quot;Realists&quot; who can&#39;t wrap their heads around the fact that a very small group of elites controls the media and most global policies. People like you who throw up these defenses because they lack the ability to wrap their heads around the power structure of a group like Bilderberg are contributing to the brain dead masses.</p>

<p>Also, you say context is important, and yet your argument is that he&#39;s calling for discretion from the media, when in fact the exact opposite words are spoken during this speech. you are a fool</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got a very good point with this. Reading through his speech, he&#39;s praising the merits of a free democracy (which everybody like to hear), but at the same time he&#39;s saying we&#39;re in such a difficult situation that some of the previous transparency is going to have to disappear. The overall message is very different with the edits.</p>

<p>Have an upward vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very concise way of putting it. </p>

<p>I agree the meme of the speech is a gigantic distraction from the real conspiracy of his assassination. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally pointing people in a wrong direction, and allows for wild attribution to dozens of different theories. </p>

<p>All because some guy took a small snippet of a speech, edited out key information, in an attempt at deceiving people, probably as a joke. </p>

<p>But it fits into a confirmation bias belief structure. </p>

<p>Because according to a lot of people here, real historians are shills, or blah whatever. </p>
