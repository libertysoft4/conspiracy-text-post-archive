Every now and then I would feel a loud boom below my house in the valley.  I used to shrug it off as sonic booms but it sure did happen a lot.  This was near hales bar marina in marion county.  Turns out it wasnt sonic booms.  It was the ground, rock or moutain slowly breaking in the valley.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For real dude?  Finding news of the military pulling out and going home would be easy enough, but nobody accounted for every piece of equipment.  Jade helm 15 was the largest military exercise of its kind ever.  It was huge news.  Units all over the country took part.  Even my buddies unit on Virginia was in Texas.  But once it was over there was no story.  Nobody counted every piece of equipment going out.  They couldn&#39;t have!  </p>

<p>And think about it.  If they left all that equipment there, hundreds of units would still be without.  It would take decades to replace all that gear at the governments place.  And they certainly didn&#39;t leave men there to man the equipment.  That&#39;s a lot of people that still haven&#39;t come home if that&#39;s the case!  </p>

<p>My point is I don&#39;t have to prove they removed all the equipment.  Yea they could hide it all if need be, but there&#39;s no way to explain billions of dollars of equipment suddenly disappearing like that.  Even on a trillion dollar yearly budget.  Not to mention the people needed to man and perform routine maintenance and upkeep on said equipment.  </p>

<p>You behave as if I&#39;ve made a wild claim and somehow the burden of proof is on me to provide something that obviously doesn&#39;t exist, but no &quot;proof&quot; would prove my point to you.  It would be written off as faked or not enough to prove that it&#39;s all been removed.  It&#39;s ludicrous to even pretend like something like that exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw mile-long convoys of tanks and Humvees being moved across the country to be put into place--but not a single piece of footage of any of the vehicles ever being moved back.</p>

<p>Not one.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s pretty safe to conclude that Jade Helm was not this &quot;temporary operation&quot; it was claimed to be in the press releases.</p>

<p>The Powers That Be are pretty nervous about something. And a lot of really smart people (in pretty high places) are murmuring about an economic crisis related to the dollar&#39;s collapse as the world reserve currency.</p>

<p>If that happens, hyperinflation will come to the US--with the resulting social unrest.</p>

<p>The Alex Jones types played up Jade Helm as if it was this martial law operation for the sake of martial law.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see it that way.</p>

<p>I see it as a government that isn&#39;t evil, per se--but scared. That it is placing equipment and personnel in positions to try and minimize the riots and looting that will foreseeably take place once the economy takes a massive hit.</p>

<p>Imagine massive standing populations in the inner cities, if their EBT cards suddenly don&#39;t work. (This won&#39;t be like the Great Depression, where most of the country was still agrarian and could grow their own food on farms. This won&#39;t be a hardy nation of rugged individualists, but a bunch of dependent entitlement-accustomed people who will panic when the government doesn&#39;t pony up.)</p>

<p>I was listening to one General on radio talking about contingency plans related to this stuff.</p>

<p>He said that, in all the modeling they did, about 90 million people would die within the first 30 days of such a collapse. </p>

<p><em>90 million!</em></p>

<p>Almost one-third of our entire country&#39;s population.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to even wrap your mind around that.</p>

<p>But it could very well happen. More easily than you think.</p>

<p>Most Americans have no idea that there&#39;s a trade war going on right now, and that an international currency crisis is occurring [that the media is dutifully not reporting]. They have no idea how close to an &quot;economic re-set&quot; the West is.</p>

<p>Once that happens, the military is going to be asked to stanch the bleeding of the predictable social unrest. [See: Venezuela, as an example.]</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think operations like Jade Helm were motivated by evil--but by fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right around the time Jade Helm was being mobilized, a high-ranking British finance minister made the news for warning people to stockpile water and food (for fears related to an upcoming economic meltdown): <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/whoa-british-official-warning-public-stock-up-on-food-water-canned-goods-cash-enough-to-survive-1-month-banks-may-closestock-meltdown/">http://investmentwatchblog.com/whoa-british-official-warning-public-stock-up-on-food-water-canned-goods-cash-enough-to-survive-1-month-banks-may-closestock-meltdown/</a></p>

<p>In related news, Germany (a few weeks ago) just warned its own populace to do the same thing (although they used as their cover a possible jihadi attack. But a jihadi attack isn&#39;t going to cut off supply lines permanently). So we can dismiss it as a cover-story. Their real fears are probably related to the coming economic implosion. Here&#39;s an article on them telling their populace to prep: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-security-stockpiling-idUSKCN10W0MJ">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-security-stockpiling-idUSKCN10W0MJ</a></p>

<p>The article starts out with the sentence: &quot;For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the German government plans to tell citizens to stockpile food and water in case of an attack or catastrophe, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper reported on Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p>The Czech Republic followed Germany in recently asking its people to start prepping: <a href="http://halturnershow.com/index.php/news/world-news/264-first-germany-tells-citizens-stockpile-food-water-now-czech-republic-warns-citizens-prepare-for-the-worst">http://halturnershow.com/index.php/news/world-news/264-first-germany-tells-citizens-stockpile-food-water-now-czech-republic-warns-citizens-prepare-for-the-worst</a></p>

<p>And, in the US, FEMA has quietly been putting up signs like this: <a href="http://allnewspipeline.com/images/FM05Xf2.jpg">http://allnewspipeline.com/images/FM05Xf2.jpg</a></p>

<li>Footnote: What it looks like is that a global conflict is shaping up. The Anglo-American banking grid is being challenged for the first time by Russia and China. If they succeed in creating a second, alternate banking grid, the US dollar would collapse over night. The historical solution to a threat like that is war. A massive military conflict between the US and Russia/China will immediately cut off supply lines to places like Germany, the Czech Republic and Britain. (Which is the <em>real</em> reason why these European countries are getting so nervous. They&#39;re going to be caught in the middle. It&#39;s probably also the real reason why Brexit was allowed to happen in the UK. In the event of a war that hamstrings Europe, the United Kingdom might set up separate supply lines by hooking back up with their former colonies and bypassing Europe altogether.) . . .

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, the government is damned if they do damned if they don&#39;t. They have well known scientists talking about major potential natural disasters occurring any time now as they are over due. It&#39;s not a bad move to set up some preemptive measures in case of the worst. They got caught off guard with Katrina and there was public outrage so they want to avoid that again I&#39;m sure. It is easy to put it into some sinister context and people will believe what they want to already. Confirmation bias is always something to consider. There are videos of these places so they exist but if they&#39;re planning on them being prison camps... I guess time will tell, however I doubt it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still don&#39;t understand the whole FEMA camp thing. I mean it doesn&#39;t make any sense. Why move us to where they would have to feed and tend us instead of leaving us as we are but instead unable to feed and tend ourselves by cutting off our bank accounts and branding us crazy in society? The whole brain washing - fema camp theory doesn&#39;t hold water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the Wikipedia page this conspiracy has been around since the 1980&#39;s so I THINK (key word) we&#39;re safe let&#39;s be real if they&#39;re going to do it, they would&#39;ve done it. Also do they really have the infrastructure OR the money OR the contractors willing to do so? Look honestly this is probably one of the most contreversial conspiracies I&#39;ve personally heard as it&#39;s just really not believeable. Do you honestly think the military would put us into those camps? With Obama&#39;s approval rating of around 15% lol. Even if they brought in NATO troops UN Troops it still wouldn&#39;t be enought IMO! Nato has like 13k troops and the UN has like 110k so let&#39;s be generous and say 15% of OUR military will do it so that&#39;s about 300k troops for a total of 423k troops against roughly 100M gun carrying Americans (According to NBC News) let&#39;s say we get 50M of those to fight or even 25M, I think we got a decent chance! Unless they bring in Russia/Chinese troops then RIP</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is what it is. If they can keep a conspiracy this huge this quiet, they honestly deserve to kill us all. Like building a supposed 800 CAMPS! That&#39;s pretty impressive. Just like people who see the FEMA coffin liners why would they waste money on burrying us? Why not just burn us?</p>
