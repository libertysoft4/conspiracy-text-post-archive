    <div class="md"><p>this perpetual debt is <em>planned</em> this is not side effect of debt based capitalism ... think about it, the banks are private business, and like every private business, profit is the most important thing.</p>

<p>so how do banks make profit? when they loan money. so in their insterest it is to lend as much money as possible.</p>

<p>does it matter  what that money will be spent on? not really, does it?</p>

<p>so banks lobby <em>hard</em> to governments to take on as much loans as possible.</p>

<p>and incompetent governments don&#39;t know what to do with all this money and the easiest way is to spend it on military. the usa alone spends more than half of GDP on military alone.</p>

<p>every&#39;s one happy, well military and banking lobbies that is</p>

<p>all these wars and military spending is motivated by banks and nothing else, all wars agaist terrors are just a fucking farce to spend as much money as possible.</p>

<p>the solution is simple, burn down the banks. (also in metaphorical sense, we just need to make them go bust, Mr Robot), the money should be FREE or at least the profits from it should be SOCIALIZED.</p>

<p>Apparently, the amount for that (for stuff like social security) is several times as much as the debt. I&#39;ve heard figures as high as $150 Trillion being quoted by reputable experts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It works like this...</p>

<p>Vote for me and I&#39;ll make sure there&#39;s lots of government spending on all sorts of good stuff where you live.</p>

<p>The competing candidate makes similar promises. People are fooled into thinking that the money for all these things is going to come from somewhere else.</p>

<p>You are right in that some of this spending is for everyone&#39;s benefit. But a lot of it is not. Like military spending for example. It always gets political support because the military industrial complex is widely distributed around the US.</p>

<p>Congressmen sell the idea to the voters that it&#39;s a good thing because of how much $$$ will be spent in their state. But nobody seems to stop and think about how their limited benefit will contribute to a deficit and debt that affects everyone. Even worse, it affects the next generation as well because that $20 Trillion is going to be around for a loooong time.</p>

<p>A really radical choice would be to trim that $500 billion/yr spending and put more of it towards things that create more jobs/benefits per dollar. Maybe even run a small budget surplus and pay a bit of the debt off each year... instead of always racking up more.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what a financially responsible household does. People are just kidding themselves if they think the country should be run differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That defence spending is so important because it does create jobs, no congressmen was to cut it and see factories close in his district.</p>

<p>You could redirect it to civil uses, rebuilding infrastructure, building public transit that is so sorely lacking in America but then you&#39;d get people complaining that this is a violation of the free market and not the governments job.</p>

<p>A national healthcare system would cost about half what America currently pays for healthcare, so there is a massive saving right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It subsidises the hightech industry and R&amp;D but in a way that is extremely wasteful and expensive so it is extremely beneficial for the companies that get the money and also the population has been trained to accept uncritically and not to question defense spending so such decisions get to be made with no public interference where as civil spending would see people wanting to get involved.</p>

<p>You could just put money into pure research and develop a computer.</p>

<p>Or you could develop a rocket that needs a computer to guide it, build thousands of rockets, test them, deploy them, heighten tensions as a result of their deployment and bring the world closer to nuclear confrontation, eventually dispose of them and then need a better trap, etc - many more jobs created and much more money spent.</p>
