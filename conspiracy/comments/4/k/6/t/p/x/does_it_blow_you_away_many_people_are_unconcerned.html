    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually just that the poorest half of us humans own as much as the 62 richest capitalist scumfuck humans</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2016-01-18/62-people-own-same-half-world-reveals-oxfam-davos-report">https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2016-01-18/62-people-own-same-half-world-reveals-oxfam-davos-report</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Oxfam report An Economy for the 1%, shows that the wealth of the poorest half of the world’s population has fallen by a trillion dollars since 2010, a drop of 38 percent. This has occurred despite the global population increasing by around 400 million people during that period. Meanwhile, the wealth of the richest 62 has increased by more than half a trillion dollars to $1.76tr. The report also shows how women are disproportionately affected by inequality – of the current ‘62’, 53 are men and just nine are women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where did the poorest half&#39;s wealth go? Paying these guys rent every month.</p>

<p>1) Wall St. crashes the economy on bad loans to underpaid serfs</p>

<p>2) Gov&#39;t prints money, borrows different money (that the serfs have to pay back later). Printed money goes to banks with 0% interest, and to directly &quot;buy&quot; &quot;bad assets&quot; ie houses. Borrowed money (that the serfs have to pay back later) goes to pay for drones and wars and healthcare</p>

<p>3) Gov&#39;t hires Wall St. to manage the money that they &quot;invested&quot; in the economy (ie the wealth they stole using printed money). Gov&#39;t gives <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4k6vvw/meet_the_oligarchs_larry_fink_may_be_the_most/">most of the wealth to one rich white dude</a> to &quot;manage&quot; for them in an no-bid contract</p>

<p>4) Serfs keep having to pay more rent for the same house as the real estate market bubbles up from all the cheap government cash</p>

<p>5) People realize it&#39;s sham and start buying gold and guns</p>

<p>6) Drones and killer AI robots. The end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can. An honest economy would be democratic, meaning that the workers would own and control the means of production (the factories, farms, shops, etc). The problem with a capitalist economic system is that wealth accumulates in the hands of a few. Money is to the economy as blood is to the body: its not useful if its not circulating around. A worker owned (i.e socialist) economy would distribute wealth more evenly and improve the functioning of the economy and the distribution of goods and services. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m an &quot;FIer&quot;. I practice frugality in order to achieve financial independence. When you hear &quot;the rich get richer&quot;, they get richer because they can save much larger proportions of their earnings than a huge majority of the population does. There are select opportunities that they can exploit, but the main cause for &quot;getting richer&quot; is due to spending below their means, which anyone can practice.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing this for a couple of years. For an example, I earn in the low six-figure range and I bought my car for $1,200. Firstly, that&#39;s much less than tons of people earning less than me so the savings margins are relatively enormous. Secondly, I&#39;ve been doing this since I was earning just shy of $30K, when I drove a shitbox I bought for $800 (~2.7% of my gross). I try to practice this across the board. Basically what I&#39;m driving at is that being wealthy is not a mandatory prerequisite for wealth accumulation. </p>

<p>Myself and a few close friends are a circle of FIers. A friend of mine earns around $50K and drives a $2,000 Toyota, and another friend owns a company and is well into the seven figure range (or more, I&#39;m not sure) and drives an early 2000&#39;s Merc he bought for $20,000. </p>

<p>Another area I disagree with is where the other person said, &quot;Money is to the economy as blood is to the body: its not useful if its not circulating around.&quot;. This is really a fundamental misunderstanding of the issue. The argument from that person is that the rich are getting richer, but the key reason is because they <em>are not</em> spending it. So, an average person should pick up the habit of saving to join in on the rich&#39;s bandwagon. Spending to spend would be naive. <a href="https://fee.org/articles/consumer-spending-drives-the-economy/">This article</a> from the Foundation for Economic Education should dispel any worries that the economy will experience some sort of crash or strain if saving more income will be adopted by a majority of the population. The author does a great job of breaking it down, here: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Granted, personal consumption expenditures represent 70 percent of gross domestic product, but journalists should know from Econ 101 that GDP only measures the value of final output. It deliberately leaves out a big chunk of the economy—intermediate production or goods-in-process at the commodity, manufacturing, and wholesale stages—to avoid double counting. I calculated total spending (sales or receipts) in the economy at all stages to be more than double GDP (using gross business receipts compiled annually by the IRS). By this measure—which I have dubbed gross domestic expenditures, or GDE—consumption represents only about 30 percent of the economy, while business investment (including intermediate output) represents over 50 percent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recommend you read the whole thing if you have the time. It&#39;s pretty fascinating if you&#39;re interested in that sort of thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not so sure the sacrifice is a sacrifice. Think about it this way, when you don&#39;t spend money on one thing, you CAN spend it on another (or save). In neither case do you lose anything, you simply don&#39;t get the instant gratification. I suppose you could say you are sacrificing the instant gratification, but sacrifice means you give something up... you never had the gratification, you were seeking it. You could as easily seek financial independence. Delayed gratification.</p>

<p>Further, if you save by putting your resources into productive infrastracture, is that a sacrifice? Let&#39;s say I install a big garden and orchard. Costs me a few grand. Now in the future this investment will pay off many more times in yield. Again I am ending up with more in the long run, but somehow that INSTANT gratification is what is &quot;sacrificed&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, pretty much every asset of mine is about as cheap as I can possibly find it. I split my time between my office and a shoebox in DC that I bought for ~$85,000. You can go on Trulia or Zillow and find a few that are probably in your price range. Having an agent actively search for you will help you a lot. My options were to buy a slightly larger place in the ghetto or a shoebox in an okay part of town. I did buy a reinforced door &amp; frame just to be safe but it has yet to receive action. It&#39;s been a peace of mind thing for me. There&#39;s only been one or two safety issues so far and nothing directly aimed at myself so it&#39;s been a good deal for me. </p>

<p>This is exactly the danger of this whole 1%/99% debate.  It conceals the true source of our problem.  People think if they had more money, then they would have access to the resources of our parents&#39; generation.</p>

<p>This flies in the face of reality, however.  Reality says we are staring dead in the face of abject resource exhaustion and environmental collapse.  As basic resources become more scarce, they get more difficult to obtain regardless of how much money you have.  </p>

<p>Many people will disagree.  I expect many downvotes, or at least enough to hide this comment.  But even if we fixed our broken wealth distribution, it means prices would simply go up and we would be no better off than before.  The problem here is resource exhaustion, and you can&#39;t fix that with more money.</p>

<p>More money just means you burn up resources faster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother problem altogether.  I don&#39;t usually go down that road because people have visceral or even violent reactions to this, but the cold fact is that economic &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;growth&quot; is what is destroying this planet.  It doesn&#39;t have to be this way, we could design an economic system where growth does not obliterate the trophic webs that keep us alive, <em>but we haven&#39;t.</em>  Furthermore, we are running out of resources to actually make the change.</p>

<p>It is probably too late, so I&#39;m taking Michael Greer&#39;s approach and trying to learn how to live in technological regression before it is necessary.  Of course I&#39;m typing this on a goddamn laptop so you can see how well <em>that</em> is going.  But I&#39;m better this year than I was a couple years ago when I was working in the technology field and had built my whole life around tech.</p>

<p>I will certainly read your link with interest, but I should say that my belief before I do is that it sounds likely that the author has not appreciated that paying back debts would reduce the total money supply (and one can therefore state with some certainty, that if we all became savers rather than borrowers there would be a crash).</p>

<p>*edit - I&#39;m halfway through the article and it has &quot;real money supply&quot; as one of the top ten indicators. As I said, if everyone paid off debts, the total money supply would reduce. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, yeah. I think you&#39;re spot-on with the geographical point of view being that you could be born in Somalia or have some sort of major disability. I think to be fair though, that it&#39;s assumed that we&#39;re talking of those in the U.S. with any start-point. I do not think that socialism is the answer, but I do agree that there are some major issues in America for those starting out. College tuition costs are astronomical as with medical costs and several others which will drastically help reduce debts (and a more broad understanding of budgeting in general, a shocking part of the US society is depressingly financially illiterate), but I believe that socialism is not the answer and that reform for those areas will be more suitable than a governmental and/or societal change.

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism != Communism. You are describing the failure of Communism. Socialism worked well but like any process was corrupted and but led to few advances (Concorde was brought to us by a Socialist system, it was taken away by a Capitalist one...). The capitalist system became the norm, and it has definitely led to huge technological advances through investment.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also population explosion to consider. The early industrialisation required lots of workers to build factories, build engines, mine for minerals. All things that meant the &quot;worker ants&quot; didn&#39;t live as long, so the little bit of money that sloshed around worked.</p>

<p>With the arrival of technology, and a cleaner environment through replacing dirty processes, there are less workers required through automation, and people living longer. That little bit of money that was sloshing around has to maintain a larger population for longer. The Capitalist system doesn&#39;t really allow the return of that money to the (former) workers, where the Socialist system did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The UK was still a Socialist society until the 1980s, as were most European states of the time. Calling the China and USSR socialist is false advertising. Much like in a capitalist system, branding is everything, much like China branding itself a Peoples Republic. The ideology may have some roots in Socialism, but they are not what would generally pass for Socialism in the West. Both are now technically Capitalist societies, though China still has toes in its Communist past.</p>

<p>Inequality in &quot;socialist countries&quot; as you describe it was indeed rife in Monarchistic / Empirical times, through Industrialisation. Socialism formed to bring rights to workers being damaged, maimed and mistreated by the Industrial Nobility (The Capitalist&#39;s Capitalists). Non US-Model Governments had (and maintain) a balance of &quot;socialist&quot; banners and &quot;capitalist&quot; banners. There is still a huge disparity, in that the vast majority of the current &quot;working class&quot; have far fewer representatives per head of population than the &quot;upper classes&quot; primarily due to voter apathy.</p>

<p>Inequality in &quot;socialist countries&quot; has grown rapidly post-Capitalisation. Just because the have-nots of today have more than the have-nots of yesteryear does not make the Capitalist system better. Where socialist ideals want the &quot;haves&quot; to provide more towards the &quot;have nots&quot;, the capitalist system and globalisation encourage the &quot;haves&quot; to keep what they like and invest centrally in what are essentially rich-man ponzi schemes, rather than reinvesting locally in benefice of the communities who have supported them.</p>

<p>An example of socialist systems encouraging philanthropy - there are many. There are still clubs and sporting facilities across the UK which were gifted to communities by families made wealthy in the Industrial period, housing built by mill owners for their workers across Northern England. Cant speak in such detail for the rest of Europe, but you wanted an example. Not perfect, but a damn sight more than an annual Christmas party with a plastic cup of the cheapest sparkling white wine available. Can you imagine a call centre owner building affordable housing for his employees? </p>

<p>The pipeline moves as fast as people spend. A good economy means a fast flow of cash in the pipeline. The elite found a way to punch a hole in the pipeline so the cash leaks into their private tax havens. At least 50 percent of all money is being sucked out from this hole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In every game I&#39;ve ever played that has rankings, a tiny portion of the players has most of the coins. This is a reality.</p>

<p>Some of them have figured a way to game the system. Some of them play (work?) all day at the game and know the best way to grind.</p>

<p>Historically, I&#39;d say there&#39;s better distribution of wealth now globally than any other time in history. Consider that for thousands of years, Lords and Kings and Churches had everything and peasants had enough to hopefully survive the winter.</p>

<p>The solution has never been to take the wealth from the Lords and give it to the peasants. They&#39;ll just use it to breed more peasants.</p>

<p>The solution is to allow the skilled tradesmen to acquire property and status with his hard work.</p>

<p>The Left thinks they can tear down The Orange One by holding him up as a rich fat cat who is unconcerned with the common man. They don&#39;t understand that poor people admire and respect wealthy people who are successful at business (but not those who acquire wealth through political influence peddling).</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not surprising. And keep in mind it &quot;wealth&quot;. Owning assets priced at a certain amount doesn&#39;t mean anything. If suddenly we have a giant volcano explode and cause a famine, suddenly the farmers and people with seeds and greenhouses will have 80% of the wealth in the world, the other 20% will be the military/guard they will hire to protect them and their food.</p>

<p>Owning Walmart doesn&#39;t mean anything unless &quot;Walmart&quot; as a brand means something.</p>

<p>To fix this problem we need to get rid of nation states and form into tribes. Governments should be no bigger than a city.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kinda agree with you and disagree with you. I think its totally possible what you are saying but that it will need a more decentralized approach. So things like 3d printing, bitcoin, solar/wind/ they also developing smaller scale nuclear reactors, so the eventually the project doesn&#39;t cost billions and can be implemented with out a giant gov $$$$ backed program. </p>

<p>To get to that point tho, I think our government is going to need more power. More power in the sense it has been loosing tons of it to the markets. We have been deregulating for so long, the republicans doing everything to dismantle the gov and then point at it and say, &quot;look see the government can&#39;t work for&quot; ignoring the fact they are ones ruining it. Not that the dems are much better, repubs are just more actively ruining shit. </p>

<p>I understand the problem with the climate for instance, but I refuse to do anything about it. I never ever stop and think about the environment. It&#39;s useless, whatever I do, it will not change anything. So I pour my thinner down the drain, drop plastic packaging in the bushes and never try to minimize my energy use. Why should I? One 5 minute gas burb of some fracking plot in the middle of nowhere and years of me trying to cut down on emissions are nullified. A neighbour getting their third child? Their offspring will offset my environmental gains threefold. Some random plane doing another lap in the waiting cue? There goes the life long &#39;win&#39; of me driving an electric car. I will not spend a second of my life trying to fix this while the big players are not even remotely concerned. Fuck that.</p>

<p>Same goes for the disproportional distribution of wealth. What can I do? Nothing. Keep working, bow down and mind my own business. Let others sort it out. They don&#39;t stand a chance. The current situation is natural, &#39;normal&#39;, nothing &#39;wrong&#39; with it. This is how we do it. Huge numbers of people will perish or get grinded into mush by the daily struggle for survival while some will flourish and revel in unimaginable riches. Who said it should be different? What is it you guys want? Humanity prevailing or just you getting rich? The first will happen and while we might not stand a chance, those belonging to the succesful, wealthy group are set up for victory. With them, we all win. Look at it like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s actually a very good question.  The main way I feel that we as a whole (and individually) can help this progress happen is, as I’ve said on various occasions before, by collectively putting down the indoctrinated racism that’s been brain washed into us that causes us to hate and be antagonistic toward one another.  We need to put it down and come together as the one human species that we indeed most definitely are.  Once we do that, then we can help one another without having to rely on the fake, artificial means of exchange known as fiat currency.  We don’t <em>need</em> money in the way it’s been used in this civilization.  Money is an indication of the dishonesty and selfishness that we currently have for if those characteristics of dishonesty and selfishness didn’t exist, then we would be able to help each other and feed each other and clothes and protect each other and exchange goods and services without needing to bribe one another through the use of that artificial device called money.</p>

<p>Everything I said, of course, is <em>much</em> easier said than done in this age apparently (unfortunately), but I feel it’s definitely what would help usher in a new civilization and way of being.</p>

<p>One thing that we can all do <em>now</em> and today independent of dropping our bank accounts and trying to live without using any money, however (a practically impossible in this society), is definitely put aside the racism and prejudice that has been indoctrinated into us - that causes us to hate each other and be antagonistic toward one another.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is good in religion - yes - but it has also been greatly responsible for much, much harm on the planet, and a LOT of it is simply a dark, corrosive force designed to incite hate and fear in people, and to control and enslave the population.  I feel that the sooner humanity can get <em>rid</em> of all religion and moves toward real and <em>true</em> spirituality, the better.</p>

<p>These are just some ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this answer. This is the level of discourse we need to be engaging in. I agree with you mostly but would like to add other, any and sundry &quot;isms&quot; as they are all as fake as our money.  I do believe that humans enjoy the process of exchange, so I find a form of value holding exchanges medium desirable. However I believe that the labor we each perform should not be the sole determinant of who we are seen to be. Nor should our current experiences and events one must tend to in life (illness , unemployability due to trauma and so on)cause one to become homeless. We can so better. I do like the idea of the Aurum....it would be nice to a have arefinable medium of exchange that would still hold value. It is very nice to see ideas in here that are worth spreading. I believe if those of us that can raise our level of intelligent communication do so, we got this. This will raise our spiritual selves and standards, as we grow into our real roles as human beings with free will. Namaste</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t disagree with this.  Barter would not be bad.  Nothing wrong with the exchange of goods and services.  Using a debt-based fiat currency paradigm seems to have resulted in much deceit and manipulation in this civilization for sure, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the labor we each perform should not be the sole determinant of who we are seen to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On one level, I agree.  On another, however, I guess it might all depend upon what one classifies as “labor”.  I mean labor can almost mean anything that takes “work” or “effort”…and EVERYTHING takes work and effort - even thinking.  As such, if one takes an open, holistic, all-encompassing approach to the definition of what labor is, then perhaps labor can indeed be a pretty good/decent determining factor of one’s worth.  Our worth and use as “labor” can be based upon our intelligence, our thoughts, our actions, what we contribute - to ourselves, to society, etc…</p>

<p>If, however, you’re looking at and defining “labor” simply as the work we do in the common “work/9-5/punch in punch out” manner, then I would agree with you that our labor shouldn’t be the sole determinant of who we are seen to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor should our current experiences and events one must tend to in life (illness , unemployability due to trauma and so on)cause one to become homeless.</p>

<p>Fully agree.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Much</em> better - by far.</p>

<p>I understand that, and do not think it is a bad idea.</p>

<p>A gold standard would at lest be a viable, doable step in the right direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biggest flaw in this thinking is that wealth is a fixed pie. It is not. Wealth can be created and wealth can be destroyed. </p>

<p>While income disparity is troublesome, you have to look at the one entity that has always served to facilitate this; the state. Look at the growth in gov. spending in the US in the last 50 years and look at the income disparity. They have grown right alongside each other. This is no coincidence. Economic freedom has decreased at the same time. Capitalism is a profit and LOSS system, but the elites have hijacked gov&#39;t to use it to protect them from the losses. </p>

<p>There is a reason that the elites aren&#39;t sticking their money in the campaign coffers of free market advocates. There is a reason the ultra-rich aren&#39;t backing candidates that want to really limit government. There is a reason the ultra-rich aren&#39;t standing against the FED. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s talk in here about &quot;honest economies&quot; implying that massive wealth concentration wouldn&#39;t occur in an honest market. However, there&#39;s some research that suggests that this is an end result of a free and honest market. Here&#39;s an article with information:</p>

<p><a href="https://frrl.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/a-computer-simulation-why-the-rich-get-richer-and-the-poor-lose-everything/">https://frrl.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/a-computer-simulation-why-the-rich-get-richer-and-the-poor-lose-everything/</a></p>

<p>From my understanding, generally speaking, the rich get richer because they can afford to leverage larger deals. For example, in an honest exchange or investment, a man with $10 in the bank can only lose $10 total (bankruptcy) but is also limited to gaining (a ball park figure) of $10.</p>

<p>A man with $10,000 dollars in the bank, however, can make a much bigger leap in wealth than the $10 guy. Additionally, in a competitve market, the $10k guy can repeatedly challenge the $10 guy until forcing the less funded man into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s the TL;DR version. Check out that link for a better explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope it does not surprise in the slightest, too many live in their own little bubbles (plus trivial distractions and major problems) to even think let alone be concerned with the bigger picture of humanity as a whole, also greed is a HUGE obstacle here. Money is a tool and a tool like any other can be used by a person or for any benevolent or malevolent reason, i think money was never needed in the 1st place anyway and i bet most know who created it and could only speculate for what reason but right now we all know is for deception and control.</p>

<p>Eventually most will have an epiphany and time will come when enough is enough just like in the past... the only question is will the good and just people win and create a better tomorrow that will last or will the cycle repeat in a loop &#39;till the end ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, yeah. I think you&#39;re spot-on with the geographical point of view being that you could be born in Somalia or have some sort of major disability. I think to be fair though, that it&#39;s assumed that we&#39;re talking of those in the U.S. with any start-point. I do not think that socialism is the answer, but I do agree that there are some major issues in America for those starting out. College tuition costs are astronomical as with medical costs and several others which will drastically help reduce debts (and a more broad understanding of budgeting in general, a shocking part of the US society is depressingly financially illiterate), but I believe that socialism is not the answer and that reform for those areas will be more suitable than a governmental and/or societal change.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I do believe that humans enjoy the process of exchange, so I find a form of value holding exchanges medium desirable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t disagree with this.  Barter would not be bad.  Nothing wrong with the exchange of goods and services.  Using a debt-based fiat currency paradigm seems to have resulted in much deceit and manipulation in this civilization for sure, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the labor we each perform should not be the sole determinant of who we are seen to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On one level, I agree.  On another, however, I guess it might all depend upon what one classifies as “labor”.  I mean labor can almost mean anything that takes “work” or “effort”…and EVERYTHING takes work and effort - even thinking.  As such, if one takes an open, holistic, all-encompassing approach to the definition of what labor is, then perhaps labor can indeed be a pretty good/decent determining factor of one’s worth.  Our worth and use as “labor” can be based upon our intelligence, our thoughts, our actions, what we contribute - to ourselves, to society, etc…</p>

<p>If, however, you’re looking at and defining “labor” simply as the work we do in the common “work/9-5/punch in punch out” manner, then I would agree with you that our labor shouldn’t be the sole determinant of who we are seen to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor should our current experiences and events one must tend to in life (illness , unemployability due to trauma and so on)cause one to become homeless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fully agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can so better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Much</em> better - by far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do like the idea of the Aurum....it would be nice to a have arefinable medium of exchange that would still hold value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold">Aurum</a> - TIL…</p>

<p>I understand that, and do not think it is a bad idea.</p>

<p>A gold standard would at lest be a viable, doable step in the right direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe if those of us that can raise our level of intelligent communication do so, we got this. This will raise our spiritual selves and standards, as we grow into our real roles as human beings with free will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very well-said.  Agreed, sir.</p>
