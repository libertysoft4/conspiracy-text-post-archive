<p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/23795-large-area-coverage-dangers.html">During the 1950s and &#39;60s, the U.S. Army dusted chosen American cities from coast to coast with a fine powder of a fluorescent, potentially toxic chemical.

<p>The act of government spraying of civilian populations with bacteria, mosquitoes, chemicals, and other substances is already an established fact. The only question is whether or not they continued doing so. </p>

It is an 8 hour video, and features various activists and professionals on the subject. It debunks any questions with empirical, scientifically tested, factual information. My favorite speaker starts around 1:24:00.</p>

<p>Not a great video when the very first point is easily debunked. </p>

<p>In my small country, most commercial jets you see are from the same national air carrier. One clear day I had a family member taking a flight north which would take him over my region. I watched the jet on an app then saw it overhead, leaving a contrail as far as the eye can see which lasted for a long time. </p>

<p>The first &#39;expert&#39; in this video suggests such a thing is laughable behaviour for a contrail. Well... Unless our national airline, of which I have both pilot and engineer friends working there, is spraying chemicals from a jet which also has passengers onboard...he is wrong and delusional in his old age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s evident you didn&#39;t read anything posted to this thread. I dont understand your overall point of contention. This issue is not whether or not these systems exist, but what they are being used for. Are you aware more than 40 countries are involved in weather modification today on a regular basis? These are facts. Weather modification has even been extended to the public. You and I purchase and schedule &quot;clear weather&quot; event from many various geoengineering and weather modification companies who extend their services to the public. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/atmospheric-geoengineering-weather-manipulation-contrails-and-chemtrails/20369">http://www.globalresearch.ca/atmospheric-geoengineering-weather-manipulation-contrails-and-chemtrails/20369</a></p>

<p><a href="Http://www.Artificialclouds.com">Http://www.Artificialclouds.com</a></p>

<p>And if you care to do your own research, here is a list of weather modification companies you can purchase services from:</p>

<p>North American Weather Consultants;<br/>
Weather Modification, Inc;<br/>
Western Weather Consultants;<br/>
Meteo Systems;<br/>
Atmospherics, Inc;<br/>
International Weather Modification;<br/>
WET International;<br/>
Ice Crystal Engineering (flare provider)</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to note that not all cloud seeding is done by private companies; much is done by local governments (e.g., SW Texas Rain Enhancement) or utilities (e.g., Snowy Hydro, SMUD) that conduct their own modification events.</p>

<p>Perhaps tell your buddies to stop posting videos of contrails and saying its aircraft spraying chemicals?</p>

<p>Even in the link you just posted it shows that cloud seeding is done via bright flares, and is done by turboprop aircraft.</p>

<p>The claim is not that all contrails are chemtrails.  In fact, the claim is actually that chemtrails are noticeably different than contrails.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and there is a worldwide conspiracy involving all major airlines who are involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The claim is not that it is worldwide, or that it involves every major airline.     </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wrong again.  You can effectively geonengineer with a very small number of aircraft.  If I recall correctly David Keith (one of the leaders in the field) claims you could do it with 6 aircraft.    </p>

<p>Stop trying to make geoengineering sound like some crazy tinfoil conspiracy theory.  It is a serious proposal, and one which has already been demonstrably deployed.  There are numerous geonengineering studies that have been done by NASA (such as SPICE).  You really think the Koch brothers aren&#39;t interested in geoengineering technology?  It is the one and only thing that can keep their oil empire from collapsing.  </p>
