    <div class="md"><p>What would you see as an acceptable source? Do you believe that every single scientific publication, and by extension literally millions of scientists and engineers over the past 60 years from all over the world, all decided to separately try and keep so many secrets for something they had nothing to do with? For what purpose exactly?</p>

<p>You think millennials (for example) go to university to study astrophysics, astrobiology, rocketry, aeronautics etc get told at some point during there degree that, hey guys please don&#39;t look  into this too much because it&#39;s a conspiracy and therefore nobody can know! All these millennial redditors have decided to keep this secret as well, for what exactly? What would all of those people <em>possibly</em> have to gain?</p>

<p>Sorry dude, NASA went to the moon several times. It was difficult and dangerous and incredibly expensive. People died doing it. They went.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know but I can think of an analogy. 9/11 was an inside job and a fraud. I don&#39;t imagine that based on this fraud Metallurgists, Architects, and engineers changed their theories on the melting point of steel and fire-code. I don&#39;t think they dramatically altered the textbooks even though by definition, such an event should be actually groundbreaking in these areas. A steel highrise structure has never before collapsed from a fire in all of history. This event should merit a complete overhaul in the design in building structure. But it doesn&#39;t, and it won&#39;t, because it is conveniently ignored that a steel building collapsed from fires. So; when you ask if physics students are told not to look into the details because they might notice a conspiracy, I think the answer is that most people who did realized there is a conspiracy, and the rest are clueless or were suspicious but then read some shitty Popular Mechanics article that had enough pro-government spin to bring them to heel.</p>

<p>Space missions typically try to go over the van allen belts as radiation can damage electronics, the van allen belts aren&#39;t sphere but have gaps around the poles. so by changing the inclination of the orbit it&#39;s possible to pass over the top of the van allen belt. </p>

<p>How did the Americans track that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t answer the question, because quite clearly, the Soviets were not able to track Apollo 11. They would have known the whole NASA story was a charade, but they had no hard evidence to prove it was fake, only the absence of evidence that it was genuine.</p>

<p>As you well know, the Soviets had the technology to send unmanned craft to orbit the moon, and to land on the moon (and take rock samples) and come back to Earth, but they knew sending humans to the moon and bringing them back alive was not possible because of the extreme levels of radiation within the Van Allen Belts, and on the lunar surface itself. So did the Americans, and that&#39;s why they faked it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How mature. You can save yourself the effort because we both know the answer - the Russians didn&#39;t send men to the moon for the same reason the Americans didn&#39;t. They simply didn&#39;t have the technology to send a craft with a sufficiently robust design to protect human occupants - the fuel/weight ratio was too great to get into orbit.

<p>Again, you need to educate yourself. A statement like that makes you look like an imbicile.</p>

<p>Now if you grew up in America, went to public school in America, I understand and empathize with your lack of knowledge. I did the same. You know what they didn&#39;t teach us? Well, a lot of things. One of them was that there even WAS a Soviet moon program, let alone what it accomplished and when and why it stopped.</p>

<p>The advantage to the Internet, though, is you can find information on damn near anything.</p>

<p>In short.</p>

<p>If you read the link there was a tad bit more to it, failure with the rickets being the biggest problem. They did continue the research and testing into the 70s.</p>

<p>But what I don&#39;t get is how you guys can accept both NASA and the USSR having sucessfully landed un-manned missions on the moon, yet one radiation belt stops them from landing humans there. Radiation doesn&#39;t kill you quickly in most cases. There was a Japanese man that was in Nagasaki and Hiroshima when the bombs were dropped, that died in the 2000s. </p>

<p>Ok, the Van Allen Belt is bad for you, now imagine you can shield against X% percentage, would you take the risk on flying through it to be one of the first people to land on the moon? If I got ok odds on surviving back and forth, I would. </p>

<p>And you didn&#39;t awnser my question... do you accept submarines existing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, lets say that they do exist. Ok? Now, there are many types of subs, most using diesel engines for power, but some that use nuclear energy. How are those people, packed into a a metal can with a nuclear generator and the radiation coming from it,  alive and kicking today? Shielding. Yup. I went all five year old on it. </p>

<p>Now, if we are able to build shileds against radiation in a submerged vessel, why jn the world shouldn&#39;t we be able to build shields on space shuttles? Well, we did. And we do. </p>

<p>It is rather silly how greatly some people protest against man landing on the moon. We have the tech. We had the tech. Greater minds then you and me worked on doing it, and did it. Couragous men trusted their lives to others in the hope of going where noone had been. And here you are, calling thousands of them liers for some unknown reason (Like, why would they fake it? Never been given an awnser there. Just been called a hoax and that&#39;s that..). </p>

<p>I truly am sorry that you are driven to go against the stream when it comes to this. Like, do you accept that the planet we stand on is spherical in shape? Do you accept the Earth rotating around the sun? Do you accept submarines? Airplanes? Satellites?... Do you accept that there are smarter people than you out there? People doing their best to advance our species in the fields of science and math, medicine, computing and others... </p>

<p>Never before have we had so much information in our hands as we do with the internet and computers. And you use it to try and shit over the people that spent years to bring mankind on the fucking moon.</p>

<p>This is amusing me greatly. Just how much thrust do you think would be required to fire a nuclear class submarine into deep space? </p>

<p>The shuttle is a flimsy aluminium can that has never left low earth orbit, and has therefore not got anywhere close to the Van Allen Belts. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the point - the sheer weight of a craft with sufficient lead cladding to protect humans from solar radiation, would be too heavy for us to get into deep space, with current technology. It was an insurmountable theoretical problem for Wernher von Braun, and it still is today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we have managed to get some &quot;flimsy aluminium cans&quot; into the air... just look at jets. So if we can do jets, why not shuttles? </p>

<p>And you seem to be missing the point of people willingly risking their own life to accomplish this. Look , for example, at the Chernobyl disaster, where 3 guys took on more radiation then any man had ever done before... they didn&#39;t die within seconds or minutes or hours. One went on for days, long enouh for his skin to start falling off. They knew the risks, they knew there was no happily ever after if they did what they did.... but to save others, they gave their lives. The people that go into space know well that they might never take off, they might never leave the atmosphere, they might never return, but they are willing to risk their own lives in the hopes of furthering our hnderstanding of what is beyond our planet. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s good that my tjoughts on the matter amuse you so greatly. If your lifes work is to try and &quot;debunk&quot; the &quot;propoganda and hoaxes&quot; of NASA, all the power to you. I on the other hand will amuse myself with dreams of what might just come off our explorations into the unknown, hoping for the safety of those that go where I will never be and smkle over the faqt that my nieces will grow up into a world made better by people pushing the bounderies of science for the betterment of the human race. But you, and your kind, will never take away from the human race that yes, we did. Yes, we can. And yes, we will once again. </p>

<p>Whole lotta &quot;should be&quot; and &quot;must be&quot; out of people like you without a single statement as to why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it appears smooth as the rest of the moon.</p>

<p>Well yes, it does. The lander left no impact crater on the the smooth, hard rock layer of the moon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you suggesting that a car-sized metal object falling at a high speed would leave no crater?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it would.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what happened. The module wasn&#39;t hurtling towards the surface of the moon, it was touching down quite gently- all of 3 mph by its final burn. And in close of photos of the landing surface, marks are visible showing the pressure from the landing thrusters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of the scientific/engineering information about space is in the public domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it is. There&#39;s a whole heck of a bunch of information about space in the public domain. If you have enough money (and intelligence, that&#39;s <em>really</em> important), you can get there yourself. That&#39;s what Space X is. A privately owned organization that learned how to get there with the info scientists figured out already. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The secrecy involved with space agencies should tell you the answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, space agencies are now private organizations, so yeah, they&#39;re aloud to be as secret as they want. As far as the previous era of space exploration with NASA goes, you have them to thank for things like glow-in-the-dark paint, memory foam, Tang, and <em>everything else they ever invented</em> since releasing everything they ever invented for public use was part of the stipulations for their operations. </p>

<p>We went back. A few times. </p>
