    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I believe it began with the assassination decade, and they are sorely piqued and irritated that it has taken so long though they have successfully reduced the wages and wealth of our once prosperous working class an our back in the 60s/70s down right privileged professional middle class. </p>

<p>Here are  the numbers for our pitiful median and average wages. </p>

<p>Average:  $44.6K/year      Median: Pitiful:  $28.9K/year</p>

<p>Those incomes do not allow home buying, and barely cover the rent.
$44- $55K/year earners.  It is not enough to buy a home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But here&#39;s the thing: Trumps not a politician. Never was. Friends with Hilldog, yes. Long time. Perhaps they colluded to make sure that she got the nomination. The oligarchal powers that be set in to motion to make sure that this exact scenario happens. Maybe they new ahead of time that Bernie was going to get into the race. NOw that I think about it, I am wondering what the timeline is to when Bernie announced, and Trump announced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re starting to see things more clearly, although I will admit it is not easy navigating all the bullshit and carefully crafted <em>false</em> bullshit.  One thing you <em>can</em> be sure of is that while the people who are orchestrating this &#39;election&#39; are many things, they are definitely not as stupid or ignorant as they <em>pretend</em> to be. </p>

<p>It&#39;s comical that people assume whoever is running this circus sideshow isn&#39;t aware of the public sentiment towards not only Hillary and Trump, but also towards the GOP and DNC establishment, and the media.  They know <em>exactly</em> what people are thinking, it&#39;s one of the reasons they spend so much time monitoring everyones social media and  digital life (remember, its not just the government that&#39;s doing this, but also the corporate world(i.e Wall St and the large Tech companies)). Once you accept the fact that none of what has transpired so far in this race has been by accident and that the will of the public is very accurately gauged by these individuals things start to make a lot more sense. It is worth noting that whomever they are, they seem to control pretty much the entire media (both television and many popular websites) and have no problem making them fall on their swords to achieve the desired effect. It is obvious the media don&#39;t <em>actually</em> have a problem with Sanders and Trump the way they <em>pretend</em> to, because if they did actually dislike them, they would simply ignore them and deny them any exposure.  Yes, they will talk up Hillary, but only because they know mainstream media approval is abysmally low and people will naturally dislike anyone the media appears to be cozying up to. </p>

<p>So then it&#39;s no surprise you&#39;ve got a guy like Trump faux-fighting with SJW&#39;s, old-dinosaur GOP members, the media, and anyone else they want him to <em>appear</em> to be being attacked by.  It invokes a carefully designed response in the demographics they want to be attracted to Trump: to make him appear to be &#39;fighting the establishment and all the other undesirables&#39; that particular group doesn&#39;t like so they will gravitate towards him in support. </p>

<p>They do the same thing with Sanders: paint him out to be a victim of media bias and the DNC establishment because they <em>know</em> people hate both of those entities.  They also know most people view Hillary unfavorably amongst the left (this is no secret, she has been strongly disliked by anti-war progressives, of which there are many, since &#39;08 atleast) and is hated intensely by the right (while it is true that the right can&#39;t stand Sanders views on &#39;socialism&#39;, they are nonetheless far less offended by him than Hillary, who embodies many of the things that create a strongly negative <em>emotional</em> response for them (heavily entrenched in the establishment, hyper-feminist, etc))</p>

<p>So at this point, it <em>appears</em> that Sanders or Trump is the one they want to win, despite the fact that Hillary seems to be willing to sell out to anyone and everyone to win.  There is also a third possibility: a seemingly &#39;neutral&#39; or &#39;centrist&#39; candidate appears on the scene late in the game to soak up all the less-zealous votes that are turned off by Hillary and Trump and are, for one reason or another, not able to find Sanders palatable.</p>

<p>The <em>real</em> question at this point is: Who is orchestrating this and why did they choose to set things up specifically in this manner? Who stands to gain the most by it? </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t try to tell me Trump is some multi-billionaire, and this is conspiracy so I can say openly, I would guess Trumps flailing and nearly collapsing empire is getting props from hidden sources.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence, like the income producing television shows, his role as Mr. Birther in 2012, those curious reports about stated income on some documents.  If the Republicans actually nominate him, and I believe the polls are not to be believed, he is not-electable, so look how nice this ends up, another President Clinton to fulfill the demands of the globalists, or a Republican picked by the House.</p>

<p>Or Trump could just be another Reagan, GW. the one who will sign the documents and tell the public lies about what they really mean. </p>

Scenario Trump secure Republican nomination.  Hilary secure democratic nomination, but is losing in internal, external polls against Trump.  Justice department at the behest of Obama (Obama hates Hilary) moves forward with indictment.  Hillary is forced to drop out.  But who will replace her? We can&#39;t have an election where Trump has such a strong advantage especially such a polarizing figure.  No problem says Obama lets just push back the election to allow the Democrats time to select a new nominee......still waiting as infighting continues.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your voting and gerrymandering is at fault here. A two party system with an increasingly polarized country leaves no sane option. You done goofed. what you need is reforms of your voting system. Hopefully the option exits to vote on or make it available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;m not even wasting my time. I hope others follow suit. 
I haven&#39;t watched broadcast/ cable TV in a yrs. I&#39;ve avoided social media (besides Reddit &amp; Tumblr) for months now. So, I have really no idea what&#39;s going on news- wise. And I&#39;m more than ok with it. 
I am stingy with my dollar, and try not to endorse propaganda (like the turd movie), 
My mind is so uncluttered. My mind is free.</p>
