<p>Of all the things currently being forced down people&#39;s neck, religion strikes me as the most obvious ruse.  Regardless of if you&#39;re religious or not, the fundamental differences between a Buddhist and a Christian is marked.  </p>

<p>And for the &quot;grand authority&quot; of the Catholic Church to declare that it doesn&#39;t matter what religion you are is... strange.  The message sounds good, don&#39;t get me wrong.  All the one world messages sound good if you just listen to the propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Beast from the Earth</p>

<p>11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. 12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. 14 And he deceives those[e] who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. 15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or[f] the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above quoted text is revelations 13.  Regardless of if you believe in this stuff, the people trying to make it happen ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN IT!</p>

<p>One world religion, and one world currency are both covered in this text.</p>

<p><strong>Check this insanity out</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>President George W. Bush told Jacques Chirac that Gog and Magog were at work in the Middle East: &quot;This confrontation is willed by God,&quot; he told the French leader, &quot;who wants us to use this conflict to erase his people&#39;s enemies before a New Age begins.&quot;[65] </p>

<p>Seriously crazy shit.  Again, regardless of if YOU believe, the people driving the boat absolutely believe!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their god is Satan (Azazel, Baal) he is ruler of this world until the return of the messiah. They pretend to be Jewish, Muslim, Christians and any other religion they can get their hands on.</p>

<p>The real religion they follow is the same one that Baalam set up for them. To trick the children of Israel into falling. This false god was Satan, it is the god of this world.</p>

<p>They make good seem bad and bad seem good. They use media in order to change our thought patterns and without a Bible and understanding, one falls victim. That&#39;s why they push the atheist narrative. It makes people open to accepting what is to come, which is the doctrine of Lucifer.</p>

<p>American Blacks, Native Americans and Hispanics are the real people of Israel. Our families have been genocide by our brothers, Edom. They also stole our culture, this is what Jesus referred to as the doctrine of the Nicolaitans. It is the religion that Baalam set up for Edom after they realized they needed to make the Hebrews fall in order to conquer the world.</p>

<p>This is the reference to Santa Clause (Satan Claws) and Old Saint Nick. Baalam had the children of Israel worship idols and eat things offered to sacrifice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Jacobs trouble will begin</p>

<p>Anyone who is from the real lost tribe of Israel will be massacred by the Zionist in a last attempt to keep world control. Speaking in terms of day to day normalcy, basically what we refer to as a false flag (the cabals way to push prophecy) will happen, not sure if it&#39;s because of riots starting or protesting but in the midst of it, people will be killed.</p>

<p>I always had the date stored mentally because it is 6/6/6 6 month, 6 days 2016 ends in 6 and 2+1 = 666/3</p>

<p>What really caught my attention was this story</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to fusionlacedillusions.com,  files are now being reviewed and analyzed , along with this elaborate deception that has been occurring for years.  Apparently, there had plans in place to fake an ‘Apocalyptic Event’ lasting for ten days next month. <strong>From June 6 to June 16</strong>, a wide variety of events were planned to trick the masses into believing it was witnessing prophesied events.  There were many other deadly plans in store for humanity, but most of those plans have been stopped in their tracks by the alliance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not the story itself, it&#39;s the fact that the 10 days of tribulation in this false news story seems to be relevant to the Book of Jeremiah and Revelations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 2:10King James Version (KJV)
10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; <strong>and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I know, &quot;Hey freethoughtsopen you&#39;re a stupid Bible Pusher&quot; but I&#39;m only trying to awaken what you already know. Satan is real, therefore YHWY is real.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_U8keF19XU">Strange Details Behind PRINCE Blood Sacrifice to Baal!! THEY KILLED HIM</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8hEyZvI2aw">Temple of Baal Arch in New York &amp; London Not Canceled - Illuminati Exposed</a></p>

<p>Edom is building Baal (SATAN) temples in 2016, if you don&#39;t believe in god, you seriously need to recheck your critical thinking. </p>

<p>If all these so called &quot;Jews&quot; praise YHWY then why are they doing EXACTLY what ESAU/EDOM/Cain was doing in the Bible?</p>

<p>Revelations 3:7,8,9</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking of conspiracy, once the cat was let out of the bag, people from all branches of life began looking and found lies everywhere, even within conspiracy itself! Once it was open, it could not be closed, think about it, can you go back to being who you were after years of conspiracy? Of course not!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p>

<p>9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why they hate Christianity (whites religion) and why they hijacked Judaism (blacks religion). The Irish were very prominent in defending what was the last of Black Rulership before the great fall of the black race and white washing of Edom began. In which the Transatlantic Slave Trade, Genocide of the original North and South Americans took place (Hebrews).</p>

<p>Edom has always been in the background, they don&#39;t teach us about the devil, they know that if they keep it a secret, they can use it as a weapon. Which is why they control all of the churches in our time and have for centuries! The real Gospel has been held hostage by the same people we were supposed to protect it against.</p>

<p>TLDR: The Zionist hate what America has become, blacks and whites getting a long and integrating with each other. The further we come to the one world organization, the worse it will become because it means that the Hebrews have a chance to come back. This in turn causes friction between Jacob and Esau (nations) in which a massive war will take place that involves mind, spirit and body, what we refer to as WW3.</p>

<p>Therefore I believe a false flag will happen in attempt to undue what Obama has done so far but it will not work YHWY&#39;s own words mention this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Romans 9:13King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need more things to google, google who is Baalam and read the story. </p>

<p>Welcome to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where the end of the world is always tomorrow. There is a lot of decent information but also a lot of purposely placed content. Keep your eyes open because Satans works are everywhere. I think this is the strongest it&#39;s ever been as recent events have correlated to perfectly close to prophecy, thus producing the Nostradamus effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be okay with it, do everything in your power to warn the people. This is no time to be cowering in fear and accepting fate (I have to fight with myself over this all the time). Spread the Gospel, if even in tidbits. The people need it and it will become much more apparent in the near future, don&#39;t let them conquer your soul.</p>

<p>The one world government will be controlled by the Messiah, not by Satan for 1000 years. Satan has confused the people just like he confused them with religion. This prophecy is not only in Hebrew text, it&#39;s in Native Americans as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the god botherers certainly have clout with humanity. Humans need to believe in something bigger than themselves, need to have hope. This keeps our potential always in check and always just out of reach.</p>

<p>Fuck religion of any kind. One of the ultimate control tools. Right next to money.</p>

<p>Solution</p>

<p>Stop swallowing the perpetual disinformation, become informed, trust yr instinct/intuition which is that little butterfly in yr gut and proceed accordingly. Use the system instead of letting it use you.</p>

<p>The low levels know the religious aspect, yet the higher you go the more into the occult and esoteric you get. This is how the true cabal retain power/control. It&#39;s very much self fulfilling prophecy, for the ones who wrote the books are bringing their content to fruition... The priest class has been and still is alive and well.</p>
