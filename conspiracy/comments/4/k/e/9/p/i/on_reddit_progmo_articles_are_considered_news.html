    <div class="md"><p>It really bothers me that they can organize and brigade right out there in the open and the admins don&#39;t care. But then again, I honestly like them organizing in the open, too. At least they have <em>a little</em> transparency, even if it&#39;s not true transparency and many Redditors who don&#39;t spend a lot of time here are deceived. I find it really interesting, too, because I don&#39;t think other &quot;stealth marketers&quot; for different industries active on Reddit do this - which makes me wonder why <em>they</em> do it, if they&#39;re anticipating some crackdown on the activity at some point in the future and can point to this and say, &quot;Obviously we were obvious, we weren&#39;t technically astroturfing.&quot;</p>

<p>Just one guy runs over 200 propaganda platforms, and his limit on them on Voat, plus yet more on other websites. </p>

<p>He does not allow pro GMO commentary, and he&#39;s trolled and witch hunted people like me by making dedicated submissions about us. </p>

<p>He very clearly has paid Reddit to advertise his anti GMO creations. His latest is an anti CRISPR subreddit. CRISPR is a technology that not only has the potential to create fantastic ag products, it has the promise to cure people of terrible diseases, yet privileged people campaign against it. </p>

<p>If you do a search on Reddit for anti GMO vs pro GMO submissions, the vast vast majority are anti Monsanto/anti GMO.</p>

<p>Based on the history of this subreddit, it&#39;s highly unlikely my comment will remain, most pro GMO commentors are censored in r/conspiracy.  </p>

<p>90% of the Anti-GMO crowd is just sick of being poisoned with round-up on nearly all their wheat/corn which is basically soaked in it. the same shit half the fucking planet has designated a full blown carcinogen. you know it has to be pretty fucking bad when CHINA!, fucking China, has banned any of these products from being allowed in to their country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pesticides and GMO are different things.</p>

<p>Growing plants with pesticides is mostly because we don&#39;t do more GMO. For instance we could take genes from a plant that is resistant to pests naturally and splice that into a commercial crop so we could remove the need to use pesticides.</p>

<p>The issue with GMO is there is a lot of unknown. They have the potential to be used for good such as adding more nutrition and pest resistance. It all depends on how GMO is used that makes the difference, but pesticides and GMO crops are very different things. Pro GMO people tend to agree that presticides are bad and that is a good reason to invest into more GMO to make crops healthier for people.</p>

<p>Corn and wheat being the two worst offenders for this. the GMO pesticide resistance isn&#39;t the core problem, its that we are adapting this food so we can soak it in a fucking carcinogen pesticide and not die, just because its the cheaper option.

<p>people don&#39;t have as much of a concern when it comes to frost proofing oranges with fish genes, but the whole monsanto/round-up thing is based on a completely different problem they have created just to save/make more money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that people are anti GMO and not anti-monsanto and anti-bad GMO use. Being anti GMO can seem anti science as you squash a lot of potential good because of corporate mis-use.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Golden rice is a variety of rice (Oryza sativa) produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible parts of rice.[1] It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin A,[2] a deficiency which is estimated to kill 670,000 children under the age of 5 each year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is why I find it hard to be anti-GMO. I am very much anti-corporate mis use of the technology but I can&#39;t rule out GMO as having a potential good. Add in that climate change will be an issue in the future and we are going to need crops that can handle the rapid changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm golden rice... isn&#39;t that the one that show negligble benefits and did not actually address the problem in any meaningful way?</p>

<p>was it not found to simply be a poor attempt at creating a cheap solution to food extremely poor in nutrition already?</p>

<p>i have yet to see a single independent study that shows benefits to golden rice consumption in addressing the vitamin A deficiency. in most cases using half the money that has been wasted on it, would have had a much higher impact in providing proper nutritious food to those people. not to mention would have none of the risks associated with the patented GMO crops infecting neighboring non GMO crops in their vicinity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s there in the wikipedia entry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2009, results of a clinical trial of golden rice with adult volunteers from the US were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The trial concluded that &quot;beta carotene derived from golden rice is effectively converted to vitamin A in humans&quot;.[28] A summary for the American Society for Nutrition suggested that &quot;Golden Rice could probably supply 50% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A from a very modest amount — perhaps a cup — of rice, if consumed daily. This amount is well within the consumption habits of most young children and their mothers&quot;.[29]</p>

<p>It is well known that beta carotene is found and consumed in many nutritious foods eaten around the world, including fruits and vegetables. Beta carotene in food is a safe source of vitamin A.[30]</p>

<p>The Food Allergy Resource and Research Program of the University of Nebraska undertook research in 2006 that showed the proteins from the new genes in golden rice showed no allergenic properties.[31]</p>

<p>In August 2012, Tufts University and others published research on golden rice in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showing that the beta carotene produced by golden rice is as effective as beta carotene in oil at providing vitamin A to children.[32] The study stated that &quot;recruitment processes and protocol were approved&quot;.[32][33] In 2015 the journal retracted the study, claiming that the researchers had acted unethically when providing Chinese children golden rice without their parents&#39; consent.[34]</p>

<p>so the study you want to cite, was actually shit canned for its unethical practices regarding human experimentation and a lack of informed consent? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the IRB concluded that there were a number of problems in the way Tang conducted the study. For instance, she provided &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; that the study &quot;was reviewed and approved by an Ethics Review Board in China in accordance with prevailing standards.&quot; It also found that some of the consent forms had not been obtained before the trial started, and there was &quot;some evidence that the dates on some consent forms were changed and that other consent forms may have been inappropriately signed.&quot;</p>

<p>Most people you guys and gals abuse on here <em>aren&#39;t</em> anti-GMO, as Nogrim explains pretty well below. But the science-light, trolly and abusive way too many pro-GMO marketers argue here (and in other comments sections around the web) cause consumers to want to throw the babies out with your bathwater.

<p>Whether you&#39;re wrong or right (on Golden rice, I believe you&#39;re wrong, but it&#39;s irrelevant to this thread) - It&#39;s bad outreach and thoroughly dysfunctional advocacy.</p>

<p>The golden rice stands out to me as dangerous, though, especially given our very limited understanding of RNA transfer.</p>

<p>And Roundup - I find a lot of GMO advocates are really pesticide/herbicide-supporters in disguise. (I mean - the biggest culprit there is wheat, which isn&#39;t even GMO, yet GMO advocates tend to get everything mixed up when discussing Roundup and its components - or deflect and only discuss glyphosate.) It&#39;s really wrecking our micro- and macro-biomes (see also our waterways, the Great Coral Reef, etc.) and it kills me that so many are persecuted for trying to research this stuff. We can&#39;t get off the planet yet, how is selling more kilos of Roundup more important than our next 100 years survival?</p>

<p>The Tyrone Hayes - Atrazine debacle is what really woke me up. For the longest time, if you Googled &quot;Tyrone Hayes,&quot; it would autocomplete &quot;quack&quot; and the first Google-paid ad was a link calling him a quack and glorifying the safety of Atrazine. Site sponsored and created by a non-profit, funded by a number of agrichemical companies, naturally.</p>

Once again you&#39;re full of shit, the countries where they are doing Golden rice trials such as indonesia are some of the largest sweet potato producers.  Most sweet potatoes will easily allow people to meet daily requirements of vitamin A.  And they DO NOT need a GM variety to produce vitamin A.  Proper hybridization and cultivation easily produces sweet potatoes with massive amounts of vitamin A.  GM food is almost exclusively being used as a way of patenting food and controlling agriculture.  I don&#39;t doubt that GM technology can have many great uses, but the seed controllers now are parasitic, crony capitalist scum. </p>

<p>Two of the top three are heavily censored anti GMO propaganda subreddits, and they&#39;re basically paid advertisements. The third one has finally moved from the top to the third position, and says: &quot;Gross, Never Eat GMO&quot;. </p>

<p>r/Monsanto, is one of the over 100 anti ag tech propaganda websites on Reddit that are heavily censored. Pro GMO  or pro Monsanto commentary isn&#39;t allowed, they&#39;re circlejerks. </p>

<p>Everyone in here is allowed to comment in pro GMO subreddits, they don&#39;t censor or ban for mere dissent. Only those harassing pro GMO commentors(and there are many of them), have ever been banned within the pro GMO or subreddits where actual farmers hang out, as opposed to the thousands of armchair farmers on Reddit who think they know better than farmers what&#39;s good for them. </p>

I&#39;m not pro-banning, but the derailment and the absence of authentic discussion when we get brigaded by you guys and gals is ridiculous and very &quot;anti-science.&quot; It also really doesn&#39;t help your mission. I&#39;ll be honest - as someone who&#39;s not anti-GMO but is anti-specific GMOs and pesticide/herbicides and wants more federal $$ in research, testing, and quality control, I really don&#39;t understand how the pro-big-ag &quot;advocates&quot; on reddit actually help the cause - the attacks and low discourse really turns people off and makes them more suspicious of GMO tech than they would otherwise be (it also muddies the water and doesn&#39;t help consumers understand the tech - which I assume is one of the tactics Big Ag purposely engages in so that they can smear those who want more, better research).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the hundreds of subscribers to GMO Myths have only been banned and censored from r/conspiracy and other heavily censored anti GMO propaganda subreddits. They don&#39;t get harassed and banned by mods in AskScience, Science, and the many other subreddits where garbage isn&#39;t allowed. </p>

<p>Many pro GMO commentors have had to have administration ban Redditors making sockpuppet accounts to harass and troll the pro GMO commentors. I myself got a message to get AIDS and die a couple of days ago. </p>

<p>Several pro GMO scientists have received death and bomb threats, and have been harassed though FOIA requests and cherry pickings and misrepresentations of their Emails. </p>

<p>Trials of products are routinely threatened or even vandalized and destroyed, and I&#39;m not commenting about crop products that will be sold to farmers, I&#39;m commenting about products that are part of non profit projects. </p>

<p>There&#39;s literally at least two subreddits created for the sole purpose of harassing and trashing a well respected science communicator and a journalist. They&#39;re hate subreddits, and defense of the their two targets isn&#39;t allowed.</p>

<p>You are a liar, but feel free to show a copy and paste of other Redditors leaving you &quot;rude nasty&quot; comments. </p>

<p>Most pro GMO Redditors have been nice considering how many hundreds of times lies are posted and upvoted, like  the oft repeated rumor about terminator seeds, which have never been sold. Look how many times people try to spread that lie here in this subreddit: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=terminator+seeds+site%3A+reddit.com%2Fr%2Fconspiracy%2F&amp;amp;rlz=1CAACAG_enUS567US571&amp;amp;oq=terminator+seeds+site%3A+reddit.com%2Fr%2Fconspiracy%2F&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.9609j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">https://www.google.com/search?q=terminator+seeds+site%3A+reddit.com%2Fr%2Fconspiracy%2F&amp;amp;rlz=1CAACAG_enUS567US571&amp;amp;oq=terminator+seeds+site%3A+reddit.com%2Fr%2Fconspiracy%2F&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.9609j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8</a></p>

<p>We get it, you&#39;re frustrated because fewer and fewer people are buying into the nonsense. Expect that to get worse as the lies are debunked and claims of harm don&#39;t come to fruition years after it was claimed they existed. </p>

<p>The consensus is right there with climate change and vaccines, and that&#39;s not going to change. </p>

<p>Thank you for proving my point - with both your personal attacks and ignoring what I had to say and changing the subject to derail.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/organicrusader">https://www.reddit.com/user/organicrusader</a></p>

<p>Notice the accounts had to be banned by administration. Notice my account isn&#39;t banned. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll also notice many of the pro GMO commentors are long time Redditors that comment about all sorts of subjects. Several are educators with degrees, several are actual farmers. Compare to you and others that routinely harass, witch hunt, mischaracterize, make false accusations, and lie about pro GMO commentors. </p>

<p>No degrees, no science background, no experience farming, just ideologues. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an 11+ year Redditor and have only had to make new accounts to escape attempts to doxx and harass me. </p>

<p>Under all of my past accounts and this one, I&#39;ve never much ventured into this subreddit, I don&#39;t waste my time doing that, and I won&#39;t anymore. </p>

<p>We always have to tell you folks herbicides that don&#39;t kill your lawn grass have been a thing for decades, herbicide tolerance was already a thing before GMO non selective herbicide tolerance products. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all OK with alternatives to glyphosate too, which may be on the way, but for now, it&#39;s actually way way down the list as far as substances used everyday with the potential to cause harm. Hell, alcohol is more dangerous, including as a potential carcinogen. </p>

GMOs can be beneficial, however, there is still much to learn on them and whatnot since they are still new and we don&#39;t have big and independent multigenrration studies done by multiple independent teams in the long run. Mainstream health sciences and peer review is a joke.</p>

There are also many studies showing inconclusive and even harm from certain GMO products and whatnot. I doubt Monsanto et al would be the Humanist way to imlement GMOs. There is much potential for GMOs, but they should be studies rigorously. Companies such as Monsanto are owned and operated by certain anti Humanist global elites. Many Monsanto crops require more and more Roundup, which contains the carcinogen, glyphosate.  </p>

<p>Anyway, anyone actually interested should look into <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/17/478415310/top-scientists-say-gmos-are-safe-but-dont-always-deliver-on-promises">http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/17/478415310/top-scientists-say-gmos-are-safe-but-dont-always-deliver-on-promises</a></p>

<p>The headlines look rosier than the report, which is much more even-handed about their benefits and drawbacks. They link to a great appendix that points you into the report for specific items you might be interested in.</p>

<p>Stop using Roundup, it&#39;s killing our waterways and our gut microbiota. Stop buying products that rely on it, like conventional wheat and oats, GMO corn/soy/cotton (where possible, this can be impossible) and non-organic produce if you have the means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your background wasn&#39;t my question. My question was:</p>

<p>How did you find this thread?</p>

<p>I&#39;m especially curious as you&#39;re posting comments about how GMOs are great, but that&#39;s not the topic of this thread at all. The topic is explicitly talking about how discussion about GMOs is suppressed and derailed (and in fact, your comments here actually do derail the discussion, which is kind of ironic, but that&#39;s beside the point).</p>

<p>Can you please share how you found this thread on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Keyword searching, another sub link? Thanks in advance.</p>
