    <div class="md"><p>I watched an interview with a Soviet journalist who said that Reagan collapsed the Soviet Union by negotiating with OPEC to crash the price of oil. The Soviets (who had some of the largest oil fields on Earth) relied on their oil production to keep them solvent. When the price crashed, they were bankrupted--and the result was that they collapsed.</p>

<p>As Russia re-emerges onto the global scene [and the neocons are calling for his ouster] one can imagine that a similar ploy was enacted.</p>

<p>But a massive problem occurred: Unlike the 1980s, derivatives contracts made such financial manipulation backfire on the West. How? Think of a derivatives contract as an insurance policy. Companies that need oil on a regular basis (and don&#39;t want to engage in complicated accounting practices to keep up with its day-to-day price-shifts might want to negotiate a steady set price. It&#39;s just easier for their book-keeping if they have one fixed price to build into their expenditure list. Many energy companies that produce electricity, for instance, took out contracts with companies like Goldman Sachs to negotiate a fixed price from an oil producer [like Saudi Arabia]. As the middle-man, Goldman Sachs promised to make a contract for $100 a barrel. No matter where the price goes, they&#39;re contractually obligated to pay Saudi Arabia that fixed price to deliver oil to Energy Company X. Okay, but what happens when the oil price crashes down to, say, $30 a barrel? Goldman Sachs is now stuck losing $70 per barrel. Here are the facts: Goldman Sachs is worth an estimated $900 billion, but it owes $52 trillion in derivatives. In other words, they&#39;re insolvent. Same thing with Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Deutschebank, etc. </p>

<p>By crashing the price of oil, they inadvertently took down the whole Western banking grid.</p>

<p>(This has massive geopolitical implications since NATO, for instance, is largely funded by Goldman Sachs and Deutchebank. For all intents and purposes, NATO is merely the operational arm of these investment banks. NATO is merely its muscle. If these banks go down, NATO is suddenly insolvent.)</p>

<p>Reagan could afford to do what he did to the Soviets because in the 1980s, derivatives contracts were illegal. In other words, he could operate more or less in a void. But, in the 21st Century, the landscape changed with all the banks now tied into the system. By attempting a Reagan replay, they accidentally took out the entire Western financial system.</p>

<p>I think you mean <em>owns</em> $52 trillion in derivatives (notional). They are not actually insolvent right now, but a black swan event or even just a large market movement has the potential to bankrupt many of these firms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Derivatives contracts have maturity dates.</p>

<p>Dates upon which payment comes due.</p>

<p>If your total assets are $900 billion and you owe $52 trillion, yeah: That&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like a sovereign government where you can service debt seemingly forever (and inflate the money supply to keep paying off the people to whom you owe money).</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs, Deutschebank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are not the US government that can scam the system indefinitely and stay one step ahead of their creditors. These derivatives contracts have a finite shelf-life. And when they come to maturity they HAVE to be paid off--or else these institutions default. And that&#39;s when they collapse. Like Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p>

<p>Institutions just as big have fallen.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not in fact &quot;too big to fail&quot;. 2008 was just about the last time that governments could bail them out. Now the total debts of these investment banks exceed total global GDP. They&#39;re now in the hole to the tune of 2 quadrillion dollars. That&#39;s 22 times the total GDP of all nations on Earth--<em>combined</em>.</p>

<p>So the US government can&#39;t bail them out in 2016 [like they could in 2008].</p>

<p>It&#39;s gone beyond the point of no return.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve (at last count) had what? Four trillion in assets?</p>

<p>They simply don&#39;t have the cash to bail out Goldman Sachs. Nor does the entire US economy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ballooned to cartoonish levels.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: And for the record, to put the $2 <em>quadrillion</em> derivatives bubble in context, the total value of the entire US economy is $225 trillion. (That includes the assets of every man, woman and child--and every corporation. Plus all the assets the government holds.)

<p>Me too.  Nothing material changed about the oil market - fracking and oil sands are super expensive compared to cheap underground reserves, yet suddenly wholesale barrel prices went into never-never land.</p>

<p>Punishment for Putin, regime change for Venezuela, no more easy cash for ISIS and other middle eastern players we don&#39;t like.  One wonders what we had to give the Saudis to be allowed to do this.</p>

After all, our oil is the heaviest, so it&#39;s extremely difficult to mass produce it at levels such as SA&#39;s. However, SA will run out of oil eventually at this rhythm, so the only ones who will benefit are the present generation and maybe the next. Expect a change in that area in future decades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, very obviously. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because the OPEC contracts from WWII are expiring, and giving the BRIC oil cartel an opportunity to start delivering oil without using the dollar as standard currency. That will cause the value of the dollar to plummet. Those oil contracts are the next biggest thing after the Bomb, which turned us into a superpower. And when BRIC gets itself set up, our economy will tank. So we&#39;re trying to tank them first, and buy them up to stave off competition. </p>

<p>You could call it a massive, international non-competitive practice. And you would be right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Derivatives contracts have maturity dates.</p>

<p>Dates upon which payment comes due.</p>

<p>If your total assets are $900 billion and you owe $52 trillion, yeah: That&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like a sovereign government where you can service debt seemingly forever (and inflate the money supply to keep paying off the people to whom you owe money).</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs, Deutschebank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are not the US government that can scam the system indefinitely and stay one step ahead of their creditors. These derivatives contracts have a finite shelf-life. And when they come to maturity they HAVE to be paid off--or else these institutions default. And that&#39;s when they collapse. Like Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p>

<p>Institutions just as big have fallen.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not in fact &quot;too big to fail&quot;. 2008 was just about the last time that governments could bail them out. Now the total debts of these investment banks exceed total global GDP. They&#39;re now in the hole to the tune of 2 quadrillion dollars. That&#39;s 22 times the total GDP of all nations on Earth--<em>combined</em>.</p>

<p>So the US government can&#39;t bail them out in 2016 [like they could in 2008].</p>

<p>It&#39;s gone beyond the point of no return.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve (at last count) had what? Four trillion in assets?</p>

<p>They simply don&#39;t have the cash to bail out Goldman Sachs. Nor does the entire US economy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ballooned to cartoonish levels.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: And for the record, to put the $2 <em>quadrillion</em> derivatives bubble in context, the total value of the entire US economy is $225 trillion. (That includes the assets of every man, woman and child--and every corporation. Plus all the assets the government holds.)
