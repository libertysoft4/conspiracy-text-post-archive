    <div class="md"><p>Respectfully disagree. We the people have the power (money). Every year USA consumers spend over 11 TRILLION dollars. This money buys the assholes a lot of influence, but ultimately it is up to we the people to foot the bill.</p>

<p>How many people bitch and moan about wasting money on war? 1 trillion in Iraq over 15+ years? Who cares... when compared to about 175 TRILLION in consumer spending during that period.</p>

<p>General Boycott is the tactic these assholes will respond to, and nothing else short of violence. I&#39;d how we the people are smart enough to play the boycott card and have the assholes play the violence card. Nothing like some (more) moral high-ground.</p>

<p>Think back to SOPA and GoDaddy. GoDaddy changed their lieing tune in about 48 hours once their bottom line was threatened. Same thing applies to any comany or the aggragate eCONomy.</p>

<p>The problem IMHO is what to do AFTER we smash the eCONomy. We the people should stop financing the shit-show via boycotts and focus those dollars/power into infrastructure. Gardens and the like. Stuff that will not be dependant on dollars to provide our future needs. Find something you keep spending on, and solve it once and for all.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it: Our employers HAVE to pay us. We do not have to buy their shit.</p>

<p>&quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&quot;
-Max Planck</p>

<p>tl-dr; we need to stop playing in the eCONomy and start building the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a tribal community system without the notion of personal possession is the only way we can live in perpetual peace.  We are too large and diverse a country to have things like the Federal Government. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;ve gone too far in chasing progress for the sake of progress and forgot to consider that maybe we have not improved our lives over the &quot;savagery&quot; of the native peoples with all our civilization.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a perfect utopia all planned out or anything, but I do think we need to return to simple living and local sustainability.  Each small community should provide themselves with as much of what they need as possible, if not <em>everything</em> they need.  Trade should be only a pleasure that benefits both parties.  </p>

<p>No human should control another.  Decisions should be made through communication and participation in your community, and taking personal responsibility for your stake in the community is a value I think we should be instilling over &quot;take a selfie and brag to your friends&quot; or whatever.  </p>

<p>Why us ?</p>

<p>Cuz the controllers needed <em>somebody</em> to do the work for them that they were unwilling to…and I guess it just fell on us.</p>

<p>And by “us”, I don’t mean “humans”.  We were around before the vehicle of the human body was created.  By “us” I mean the intelligent non-corporeal identities that <em>inhabit</em> the vehicle of the human body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what are they doing if we&#39;re somethings slaves.</p>

<p>That’s a question the answer to which need not be understood in order for our being a kept species to still be very much the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t do fantasy.</p>

<p>Neither do I.  If you think what I linked is fantasy, then you have quite a long way to go still before you understand what’s really going on on this planet.</p>

<p>Definitely lots of aspects of humanity.  That&#39;s for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you believe that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a belief.  It&#39;s an intelligent assessment based on the study of relevant information and data - a far different, more potent thing altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how do souls enter a body ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One need not understand the mechanics of ensoulment to understand that there is a dynamic of power manipulation on this planet and that there are groups overseeing and in charge of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#39;t make sense, sounds like fantasy.</p>

<p>Understood.  Most things one doesn&#39;t understand do indeed sound like fantasy.  Turning a basic flashlight on would be considered veritable magic to a Sentinelese bushman who&#39;s never seen such a thing before in his life.</p>

<p>End all foreign free trade deals. Return to protectionist policy.</p>

<p>End all foreign alliances. Let the rest of the world pay for its own defense.</p>

<p>Deport all illegals immediately. Shoot any who resist deportation. Build a wall on the southern border.</p>
