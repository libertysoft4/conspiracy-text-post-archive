<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6p1zxKnDeM">Putin himself</a> says what <strong>history has recorded</strong> , that communism and bolshevism were completely jewish political movements. </p>

<p>Maybe less then 10% of jews were bolsheviks, but 90% of bolsheviks were jews. </p>

<p>In my country, Romania, the communist party, before the great liberators of the Red Army came in, was comprised of ~10 Romanians and a couple of hundred jews. </p>

<p>Bolshevism was a completely Jewish idea, put in practice by bolshevik jews, for the benefit of bolshevik jews. </p>

<p>Conversation I had with an apologist a few weeks back.  He couldn&#39;t accept such truths until this one critical aspect came out.  Putin has been just recently released information that some 90% of the Bolsheviks were all ethnic Jews.  These are the same disgusting people who murdered the Tsar and his family in cold blood, then wiped out how many millions of Russians?   More than the so-called Holocaust (the one they demand be capitalized)  Seems very strange, to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you joking ? </p>

<p>The International Red Cross Report on the Victims of War from 1948 numbers the victims of all german camps at 275000. Now, one must remember that the Red Cross had access to the German camps, but not to those in the USSR. The number of people that went up in smoke didn&#39;t even break 1 million until the 50&#39;s. </p>

<p>In Europe it&#39;s a crime to say these things. In my country, for example, I can go to jail for up to 2 years if I talk about these things on a public platform aka in the press, at a rally, on radio/tv . Nobody was ever convicted or charged, mainly because most of the population (after 50 years of communist utopia) at least suspects these things are fishy. People here, in private, have a much better opinion of the German Army then of the Allies. </p>

<p>&quot;The Nazis might have killed the Jews, but the bad guys won WW2&quot; is a common thing to hear among Romanians. </p>

<p>But no, I wish I was joking.    This very inconvenient truth is not something widely discussed.  Id someone today heard it, they would very likely discount outright as &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot;  ZThese very easily verified tidbits spell out a lot to the world.  They still resist learning or accepting these truths.  </p>

<p>As were witnessing it fall apart all around us now, will they learn this time?  How many engineered financial collapses does one need to go through to determine, 1.

<p>The loser, if he endorses the winner, always has his campaign funds transferred to the DNC (and thus the winning campaign). More than election fraud, you really ought to be considering the idea that your bolshevik jew hero WAS NEVER ACTUALLY RUNNING and always intended this to happen.</p>

<p>Instead of “TRUMP IS JUST RUNNING TO MAKE HILLARY WIN”, why <em>wouldn’t</em> “SANDERS” make sense there? I omitted “more”, because the former makes zero sense. What better way to hide your crime than to accuse your opponent of doing it? That has been used innumerable times in the past by… well, you won’t like this, but jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is capital-generating private property.</p>

<p>Which wouldn&#39;t exist under marxism. </p>

<p>Therefore, the Reddit owners <strong>can&#39;t</strong> be marxists, QED.</p>

<p>On top of that, Hillary Clinton is super not a marxist. The Democrats aren&#39;t anywhere close to marxists. I&#39;m an anarcho-communist, I know marxism and marxists. Look around on any of the communist-oriented subs here on Reddit, and see how much support you find there for Clinton or even for the default Reddit subs. </p>

<p>The Democrats are a capitalist party, same as the Republicans, and have been for <em>at minimum</em> the last 116 years. </p>

<p>The problem is that as a result of the Cold War, the default term for somebody politically that you don&#39;t like is &quot;Marxist!&quot; without any thought or consideration to their <em>actual ideology</em>. Even Bernie Sanders isn&#39;t a socialist, much less a communist, as he&#39;s not calling for worker control of the means of production. At best you could call him a social democrat, and communists take a very dim view of social democrats as it was German social democrats who killed Rosa Luxemburg and basically held the door open for right wing fascists. </p>

<p>Is that enough of an argument?</p>

<p>Bullshit. Reddit is only &quot;open and accessible&quot; for their paying corporate clients. The average user can go fuck themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is important that all Redditors are able to speak freely and voice their opinions without fear of being attacked or ridiculed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, but actually very dark. More freedom from &quot;attack or ridicule&quot; means less freedom for people to express themselves, ask tough questions or have a dissenting opinion. All they have to do is continually expand the definition of &quot;attack or ridicule&quot; until it includes anything they don&#39;t want you to say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although some users help finance Reddit, we cannot treat them differently than any other user.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Straight up fucking lie. Reddit has been turned into the website equivalent of a call girl. Pay them enough money and reddit will do whatever you want.</p>

<p>Which wouldn&#39;t exist under marxism. </p>

<p>Therefore, the Reddit owners <strong>can&#39;t</strong> be marxists, QED.</p>

<p>On top of that, Hillary Clinton is super not a marxist. The Democrats aren&#39;t anywhere close to marxists. I&#39;m an anarcho-communist, I know marxism and marxists. Look around on any of the communist-oriented subs here on Reddit, and see how much support you find there for Clinton or even for the default Reddit subs. </p>

<p>The Democrats are a capitalist party, same as the Republicans, and have been for <em>at minimum</em> the last 116 years. </p>

<p>The problem is that as a result of the Cold War, the default term for somebody politically that you don&#39;t like is &quot;Marxist!&quot; without any thought or consideration to their <em>actual ideology</em>. Even Bernie Sanders isn&#39;t a socialist, much less a communist, as he&#39;s not calling for worker control of the means of production. At best you could call him a social democrat, and communists take a very dim view of social democrats as it was German social democrats who killed Rosa Luxemburg and basically held the door open for right wing fascists. </p>

<p>Is that enough of an argument?</p>
