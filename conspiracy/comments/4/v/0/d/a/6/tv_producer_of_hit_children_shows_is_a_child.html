        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Daniel Schneider I believe might of molested many young girls who were part of his shows for years. The information here is what is confirmed or has been deeply researched and not stitched to make some elaborate lie. 
In these links posted below you will find the vines, stories, and facts to back what I am saying. 
Lets get on with it, shall we? Dan was outed by 4 different actors or people in the buisness with a handfull of other producers calling out their shady buisness practices and what was going on behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Check out the Crazy days and nights blog and scroll down to the comment made by &quot;himmmm&quot; 
This user known as him was first to be believed to be Robert Downey JR, though it seems to be 4 men who are out for vengence who have worked in the film industry for years. The way the comments are structured and the statistics back their argument well, and only people in the bizz know it. 
Here is what the anon had to say: </p>

<p>&quot;Go back and READ the comments by L ? they are correct. 
As for Dan S.?  You were right about probably messing up his game. He&#39;s a monster. The WORST predator alive. And if you wonder why nobody will confront or charge him? He&#39;s in charge of multiple HIT SHOWS for Nick which rakes in oceans of money. Tens of millions of dollars multiplied by many years and many shows (not to mention his merchandising royalties). So Viacom-Nick warn him to cool it ? then pay for his damn lawyers. 
What about the parents? No tweener parent who shoved their kid into the limelight from birth is going to cross him either, and risk career suicide and loss of revenue (and residuals and future career). No matter how bad it beep up the kids. Especially if there&#39;s MULTIPLE kid actors in the family. And the kid&#39;s agents are complicit too. Just ask the Spears family. A LOT of settlements get paid out of Viacom&#39;s accounts. 
As for the rest of the guesses ? I wish I had time to read and think and ask others but I have to run. I do know the Joanie Loves Chachi and the Erin Moran thing were correct. Good guessing &quot;L&quot;?now, WHO was that big shot Tutor?? So well connected?&quot; -himmmm </p>

<p>Later on the media pushed it under a rug saying they were &quot;losers and butthurt&quot; people who worked in the industry and closed the case. Though, we had absoluetly no two sided argument from these &quot;journalists.&quot; 
Reason we see this as evidence is because this user actually has outed certain actresses who were abused sexually. </p>

<p>Jennete Mcurdy has made two vines to Dan S, while working on another show. This was deeply disturbing also, very off putting and almost like a intentional under the radar call out to his abuse and how he used her. 
Another vine was her showing,her bruises on her body to Dan. 
You can watch them right here: 
<a href="https://youtu.be/xdNZjxJ0ifg">https://youtu.be/xdNZjxJ0ifg</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA83HVLnmmU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA83HVLnmmU</a></p>

<p>Actresses are great masking themselves into a character, but as you watch it over and over you sort of hear a cry for help. </p>

<p>Amanda Bynes and Jamie Lynn Spears were part of sex scandles with Dan Schneider years ago, and its to be believed that Dan is the father of Jamie Lynn Spear&#39;s daughter. If you read this article you will find out the sick truth that there has been no father confirmed:</p>

<p>Casey Aldridge, former boyfriend of Britney&#39;s younger sister Jamie Lynn, has dumped the 16-year-old claiming he is not the father of the baby. 
Aldridge is wanting Jamie Lynn to submit to a paternity test. People close to the couple have said their relationship has been &#39;shaky&#39; for months.&quot; 
&quot;Casey doesn&#39;t want to be with her until he&#39;s sure that he&#39;s the father.&quot; said a friend.  Rumours have circulated that she is pregnant by an older TV producer Dan S.  Earlier in the week, Jamie Lynn was seen attending a parenting class.&quot; </p>

<p>This would also explain the overall facial and certain genetical features on the child being similar. 
I believe that Nickalodean paid high and tried very hard to make sure no one would know of this rumour, and to this day no one questions it. </p>

<p>Even Amanda Bynes has went through certain traits that are very prevelant in sexually abused children. She has personality disorders and went into hardcore drugs, got in trouble with the law, and even made tweets about her father putting mind control chips into her head and other tweets about abusive nature from people near here. She is a total train wreck now and this was linked to child stardom, and I believe Dan aswell. 
This displays her mental illness growing, losing sight of her true self. Its very disturbing so beware, but this is very prevelant in sexually abused children. </p>

<p>Her disdain for her father might been grown for forcing her into this situation due to the high money income Amanda brought in. </p>

<p>This video here is just being used to show the interviews and numerous other stuff with Jamie Lynn, I do not think its some MK Ultra illuminati story. The video is good for the first 10ish minutes. Thats just me tho. Enjoy this video</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/EmdO74y1D9k">https://youtu.be/EmdO74y1D9k</a></p>

<p>Mind control being a symbolization for her father making her quiet and telling her to keep going as he abused her emotionally, and dan affected and destoryed her further. </p>

<p>Here it is: 
<a href="https://youtu.be/hY4mv8NEgyo">https://youtu.be/hY4mv8NEgyo</a> 
<a href="http://www.conspirazzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/amanda-bynes-microchip-brain-mk-ultra.jpg">http://www.conspirazzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/amanda-bynes-microchip-brain-mk-ultra.jpg</a></p>

<p>There are also numerous other interviews and such supporting this theory but it would take years to pick at every single one. Though watching her life spin into what it is now,has mostly something to do between the end of the Amanda Show and her issues now. We must ask ourselves; how and why. Is this Dan forcing her into splitting her personalities on Amanda Show to dizzy her judgement? Is it symbolization of a mad man hurting a child? What is this? </p>

<p>Pedophilia is so bad in Hollywood for children and I am standing up for all the kids who could of been safe and sound. I am not saying Dan is, I am saying there is so much evidence it should be looked into. </p>

<p>Here is a fantastic passage from a user on the forums I go on: 
Hollywood is creepy place, to say the very least. While Im not in the business, I know people who are on a personal level, and they have told me things that have made my skin crawl. The following article is a summary of some the things they have openly talked to me about. </p>

<p>The theme of pedophilia in Hollywood is all too common; I mean ridiculously common. Its all hush-hush because of the amount of money and executive power most of these people have, but regardless, stories get out.; 
Stories like parents who are familiar with the business whoring their own children off to known pedophile producers and have no problem doing so because theyre usually abusive themselves and want their child to become the familys cash cow. Many parents who unfamiliar with the business dont realize what theyre getting their child into beforehand, but when their child confides in them after being inappropriately touched by a producer, the parents dont want to file an accusation and ruin everything that child has essentially built for them. 
Child stars are often molested at a young age, and then become hyper-sexual by the time they are in their late teens. By then they are willingly **** any and every producer they can for gigs. While theyre getting money and fame in exchange for sex, they may not feel guilty about it at the time because they are being instantly rewarded for their behavoir, but as these stars get older and less desirable to producers, and get less famous, the actions of their youth come back to psychologically haunt them, resulting in meltdowns and erraticbehavior. Just look at stars like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Macaulay Culkin, Amanda Bynes and many others, it becomes apparent. 
One of the greatest examples of an alleged child predator producer is Dan Schneider, who created and wrote Zoey 101, All That, Victorious, iCarly, The Amanda Show, Drake &amp; Josh, and What I Like About You, and is the most successful writer/tv executive in Childrens Entertainment Television for the last thirty years.&quot; </p>

<p>Also here is a thread of him displaying his foot fetishes in the numerous TV shows he has been part of. What is really freaky and I will link it below; he asked children on Twitter to take pictures of their FEET. No joke here it is </p>

<p>And a thread full of evidence to back this </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is almost impossible to make it in Hollywood in some way without selling your soul, even if only in a metaphorical way.</p>

<p>Pedophilia and other atrocities are the norm in Hollywood. People know this and they do not care. They continue to support terrible movies and music. It is funny that these days one does not solely have to reply on pop music or culture anymore because there are endless of amounts of films and music out there.</p>

<p>I am a woman and im supposed to be into celebrities and crap like that. It is like idol worship. </p>

<p>Does anybody watch movies anymore? They are absolutely terrible. If you even have average intelligence, you can figure out all the plot points within minutes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just rambling, but fuck hollywood.</p>

<p>Sorry but that&#39;s the most absurd thing I&#39;ve ever read. Film is a visual medium and people watch for more than just plot points. And besides, there&#39;s still plenty of great films being put out that are concerned with narrative, you just clearly aren&#39;t paying attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much are you watching? How much do you care to? It&#39;s fine if film isn&#39;t really your thing, but if Deadpool (lol) is all you can name then you just aren&#39;t exposed to the same things that most others are. I know it&#39;s easy to see the sequels, remakes, derivative blockbusters and get jaded, but those are never what people are talking about at the end of the year. Even when some of the more sappy, predictable award bait comes, there&#39;s still so much great work coming out, in and out of the studio system. </p>
