        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I just heard some crazy shit.</p>

<p>There was a chick crying next door outside and I couldn&#39;t help but find out what was going on.</p>

<p>Her house she&#39;s renting was just bought out from her previous owner. The previous owner calls her and tells her the new owner is a scammer. The check used to purchase the property bounced.</p>

<p>The new owner of the property has a fake name. Dream green Abu mohammed or someshit. They LLC&#39;d on Mecca street in Detroit. The checks are sent to an address in Dearborn that&#39;s not registered to any company.</p>

<p>This new landlord called her up and told her he needed her birth certificate, ss and license. She refused to hand over her birth certificate.</p>

<p>He calls back and says he needs to raise her rent to 550. She can&#39;t afford 550 and negotiates down to 450.</p>

<p>He then starts sending her threatening messages stating that he&#39;s going to evict her and gives her an ultimatum. Vacate the property immediately and collect 75$ or she&#39;s out at the end of the month regardless.</p>

<p>She tells him that she can&#39;t move within that time and is unwilling to negotiate. He gives her a typical mafia threat.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t know me and the people I know. You don&#39;t want to mess with us.&quot;</p>

<p>After asking around I think this guy is related to </p>

<p><a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Courts/2016/07/06/A-man-charged-with-providing-financial-support-to-al-Qaeda-was-indicted-today-on-charges-he-tried-to-arrange-murder-of-federal-judge-in-Toledo.html">http://www.toledoblade.com/Courts/2016/07/06/A-man-charged-with-providing-financial-support-to-al-Qaeda-was-indicted-today-on-charges-he-tried-to-arrange-murder-of-federal-judge-in-Toledo.html</a></p>

<p>The name of the LLC they are working under is 10 sons and 2 sisters or someshit and everything about them links them to Dearborn.</p>

<p>I think these guys are going around and buying property in order to acquire identification and launder money.</p>

<p>She called the local police and they aren&#39;t taking the threats seriously.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I just want to let everyone know that the young lady went directly to detectives downtown and handed over her phone conversations and text messages. I&#39;ve also handed them the articles you guys linked. I personally think feds need to get involved due to his behavior and profile.</p>

<p>DO NOT contact this guy or harass him. He probably is really dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Not only that, but even without a lease, you can show proof of precedent - i.e. show all the check stubs or credit card receits, etc or your rent payments establishing what your actual rent amount is.  That way you&#39;ll have at least some sort of legal argument for how much you&#39;ve actually been paying.</p>

These days, busting scams on local TV news seems to be a pretty big ratings booster (all the main channels in my city have a reporter that does nothing but that, every night), she could use that to her advantage if any of this is true. Especially with the terrorist angle. Good luck to her either way.</p>

Any angle they can use to sensationalize shit...but on this occasion, that tendency by the MSM can actually be used to the girl&#39;s advantage if they really play up all the horrible shit that&#39;s in fact <em>really</em> happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be a local &quot;renter&#39;s rights&quot; type of organization (either in the city or the state).  Every state has different laws which govern real estate--but in general I don&#39;t hink it&#39;s possible for a new building owner to just call up a renter and inform them &quot;I&#39;m the new owner, Fuck You rent is now $xxx.&quot;  Obviously none of this matters if the renter is facing a crime syndicate--but you would think the police would definitely want to know.  Always much better to go to the station and talk to someone in person than over the phone.  </p>

<p>One of the most important things to consider is:  IS THE RENTER UNDER A WRITTEN LEASE and when does that contract end?
When new owners buy a house with a renter--they are taking over whatever contract that renter is under (sometimes there is NO CONTRACT, but just a month-to-month).  Every state has different laws--so best thing to do is for her to go to the police station--they might even help her find a local/county or state renter&#39;s rights organization...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the detectives told them since the check bounced that Mr. Blue has no rights as a landlord.</p>
