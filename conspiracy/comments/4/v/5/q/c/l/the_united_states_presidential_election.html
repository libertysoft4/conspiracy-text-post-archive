    <div class="md"><p>i believe that voting counts yeah. what i think we dont account for is the psychological grip they have on us where we think ourselves into saying nothing can happen. if the majority voted for someone other then the main two, even if they didnt let it happen as it were the uproar would be undeniable, the exit poles and the people would know something is wrong so really we are the ones that keep ourselves in this charade </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can keep your head down and keep voting and waiting for that &quot;change&quot; they keep talking about...</p>

<p>Or you can wrap your head around the fact that you are being lied to by people who don&#39;t care about you, who are actually <em>opposed</em> to you, and you allow them to stay in power by supporting them and obeying their policies.  Instead of laughing at the militias being railroaded by the mainstream media, or kissing every cop&#39;s ass that gets shot because people (of all races) are sick of the unaccountability and constant harassment- you need to realize that this is how the change will come about.  Not by &quot;voting&quot; LOL.</p>

One is a fiercely venal social climber, hand picked and vaulted into the nomination by a depraved aristocracy.

    <div class="md"><p>I favor Trump, 6 months ago I wouldn&#39;t have, and when he announced it a year ago I just laughed out loud. I ended up listening to him and he changed my mind, even with his tendency to speak without a filter. I do not think he is racist or trying to divide our country, in fact I feel he wants us to come together. I try not to buy into conspiracy theories, but it seems some are indeed legitimate and that is troubling. I do not dislike Democratic citizens, I actually feel like they are being screwed by the DNCs choice this time because of the blatant corruption. I also feel I should point out I&#39;d have no trouble voting for a woman if she was actually qualified and had good policies for the country. I do not favor globalism, I instead see the world kinda like I see the United States, with each individual state governing itself the way they see fit, but with some overlaying rules that each should follow. It seems corruption is the biggest enemy across the world, if we could only rid our cultures of it completely.</p>

<p>As you can see I&#39;m honestly not very good at being articulate, but I hope my point was made. Respect is the greatest thing we can give each other in all facets of life. </p>
