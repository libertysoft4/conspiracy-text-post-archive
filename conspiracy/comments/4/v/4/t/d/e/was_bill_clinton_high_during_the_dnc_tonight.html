    <div class="md"><p>One of the youtube comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay in all seriousness I asked my wife (registered nurse who works with the elderly full-time at a care home) to have a look at this a few times and and this is her take: The movement starting at 0:01 is involuntary - some kind of seizure - but the second movement starting around 0:04 is voluntary, ON PURPOSE, to cover up the first movement and make it look like the whole thing was voluntary. She says it&#39;s obvious when you look closely by the way Hillary &quot;comes back&quot; into conscious control at 0:03 - 0:04 then sort of mimics the same movement but consciously rolling her eyes at the same time in a silly way. In other words, Hillary KNOWS she has something wrong with her brain and was prepared instantly to try to cover it up in public.﻿</p>

<p>Not dementia, watch his speech.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I watched the speech and am not convinced that it isn&#39;t the early stages of Frontotemporal Dementia, or perhaps vascular dementia, only affecting certain areas of the brain. FTD is different than Alzheimer&#39;s in the respect that memories (especially long-term) and speaking abilities are preserved until much farther into the progression. </p>

<p>My father-in-law has FTD. He was a contractor and, even when he could no longer figure out how to operate a light switch, he could speak eloquently, and for hours, about his past. He usually started with when he first met my MIL and told a long story about the details of how they met and how their life played out (Clinton&#39;s speech gave me flashbacks of that). He could still give advice on building a house as he sat wetting his diaper. The story was always the same (until his memory really started to go) and he could recite it, at will. He also kept up with current events and could articulate on sound bytes of things he picked up from the news.</p>

<p>Some of the drugs that he was given would afford him moments of extreme clarity; and he could fake normal for a certain amount of time. Long enough to convince his family practitioner that he was fine, and long enough to convince a car dealership to sell him a car despite terrible credit, poverty-level income and no recent employment history. He would then drive home into oncoming traffic because the dementia first affected his ability to navigate in space and time. Even when he seemed normal to most everyone, I detected a certain vacancy in his eyes; very similar to Clinton&#39;s.</p>

<p>Considering Clinton&#39;s lifetime of speaking history and articulate speaking abilities, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to learn that he was in the early stages of FTD and still able to pull of this speech.</p>

<p>My FIL has visual neglect and was frequently surprised by unexpected things in his field of vision. I often observed him react in the same way that Clinton did to the balloons. I also noticed various examples of possible aphasia during the speech. After pushing himself to remain coherent for periods of time, my FIL would always crash and sort-of check out; again just like Clinton was doing in the audience.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be very curious to hear an analysis of the footage by a dementia expert.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> One more note. One of the first symptoms of FTD is difficulty with gait. Watch his handler rein him in on the balloon video. </p>
