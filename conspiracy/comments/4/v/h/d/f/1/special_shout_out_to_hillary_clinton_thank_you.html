<p>It&#39;s kind of funny that Sanders&#39; campaign showed that you can pretty easily appeal to the youth vote. You just have to change your policies to be more leftist. They aren&#39;t going to win over many millennials by trotting Katy Perry onto the stage. </p>

<p>Sorry, I have to disagree.  The DNC trotted out every celeb they could lasso in for an appearance, as if random celebrities have more worthy opinions than literally anyone else.  They&#39;ve stepped the freakshow up a notch, beyond ridiculous.  I was embarrassed for this country.  They should consider just merging the Oscars night and the DNC.</p>

<p>Why does everything have to be a comparison?  In the past, the democrats could seemingly be held to a higher standard.  Those days are of course, over.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The DNC is richly deserving of being attacked due to the fact that only days prior, Wikileaks proved how corrupt they are.  Maybe you should look into that just a little bit.  There is no feasible choice this election cycle.  This entire charade was manufactured for &#39;murican consumption, in order to place a corrupt oligarch into the highest office there is.  These two nothings are the choices they force us to make, and out of 300 million+ americans, they are supposedly the best suited to lead us.  The notion is so absurd it&#39;s disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just find the whole Presidential race very sad.</p>

<p>On one side, you have a shamelessly corrupt criminal who is, in all likelihood, extremely ill and medically unfit to hold office, hiding it from the voting public.  One who is attempting to continue a family dynasty by riding on her adulterous husband&#39;s coattails.</p>

<p>On the other?  A racist, sociopathic, spray-tanned nutter who was originally a complete joke that has now gone too far and must be seen to completion.  He is very quick to draw attention to his record on job creation, but he has zero political experience and his political &quot;success&quot; seems to involve delivering soundbites to the gullible and the clinically stupid, while his business &quot;success&quot; appears to consist of repeatedly bankrupting his own vanity-project companies in order to cash out.</p>

<p>These are the products of a country with a population in excess of 300m people.  As a British person, I have to ask &quot;What the fuck happened?!&quot;  If this were the UK you&#39;d be asked to choose between Cherie Blair or Philip Green.</p>
