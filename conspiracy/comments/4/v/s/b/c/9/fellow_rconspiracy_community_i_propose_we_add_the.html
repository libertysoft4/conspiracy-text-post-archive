    <div class="md"><p>The MSM really is the most important piece to the puzzle. The whole reason people don&#39;t question 9/11 or any other major conspiracy theories is because the media doesn&#39;t, and people just assume that if there was anything worth reporting, it would be reported. We obviously know this to be untrue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. But here&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering.</p>

<p>How much is red team channels and pundits going to report on this? Because you have to consider two things: if one side&#39;s doing it, you know the other side is. And number 2, reporting on it may awaken people to question and inquire if red team is doing it.</p>

<p>They&#39;re pigeon holed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Thats basically what confirmed for me that he was the people&#39;s choice. The right choice. With all the cheating and downplaying the RNC did to Trump (i mean, look at what happened in Colorado) and he STILL won? He won against all odds, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING was against him, except for one thing, the people. The people were for him and the people are for him, he is the <em>only</em> candidate who is <em>for</em> us, so we are for him.</p>

<p>I may not be able to vote due to imperialism. But if i could, me,  and everyone that i talk to, would vote for Trump. </p>

<p>On another note, from the get-go, i knew something was off with Hillary, (too reptilian hahaha) and now im <em>convinced</em> that <em>she</em> is the number one enemy of the united states of america, its morals, its way of life,  democracy, the liberty and hope it supplies to everyone born on this earth. </p>

<p>I have never felt so negative towards a candidate, not even local ones. </p>

<p>On May 18, &quot;Morning Joe&quot; co-host Mika Brzezinski said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz &quot;should step down&quot; because she had favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders throughout the primary. One week later, Brzezinski doubled down, saying, &quot;My contention all along has been that [Wasserman Schultz] has been in the tank for Hillary from the get-go, and it&#39;s been quite obvious.&quot;</p>

<p>The repetition seemed like no big deal at the time, but now hacked DNC emails show that in between Wasserman Schultz and her staff flipped out, pressuring MSNBC to make Brzezinski and partner Joe Scarborough tone down their criticism. Clearly, it didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Trump said that he thought that the Russians had Hillary&#39;s emails. (And probably so do several other groups) and that if they have them they should release them because it&#39;d be helpful (a half joke but would be nice if it happened). </p>

<p>The DNC Leak (separate issue) was blamed on the Russians by the Dems. There were even a couple of posts here and one or two on twitter who said that they would deflect away from a whistleblower by blaming the russians. Then on cue, they did. Coincidentally not long before the leaks a Dem staffer was killed in a burglary gone wrong - but nothing was stolen. He was on the phone to his gf who said that he told her everything was fine before ending the call. A few people have suggested that he was connected to the leak. It seems that he would have had the appropriate access, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that he did it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In
the conduct and management of the affairs and procedures of the Democratic National Committee,
particularly as they apply to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential nomination process, the
Chairperson shall exercise impartiality and evenhandedness as between the Presidential candidates and
campaigns. The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the
Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party
Presidential nominating process.</p>

<p>The DNC&#39;s own rules state that they must remain impartial during the nominating process. &quot;Backing the Democrat of their choice&quot; as you put it is exactly against their own rules. </p>

<p>So, what do we have here? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>A CNN Producer asking a member of the DNC that they&#39;re going to interview if there are any points they want to make, and telling him they&#39;ll stay &quot;Dem focused&quot;, meaning they&#39;re going to focus on Sanders v. Clinton. Which shows CNN coordinating ahead of time with the DNC to attack Sanders in an interview.</p></li>
<li><p>A member of the DNC asking if there is any &quot;newsworthy oppo&quot; that can be brought up in the interview. &quot;Oppo&quot; is slang for &quot;opposition research&quot;. Have they dug up any dirt on Sanders that they can bring up in the interview. Which shows that the DNC was working against Bernie Sanders in the primary when they&#39;re supposed to be nonbiased.</p></li>
<li><p>A trio of DNC members are asked if they &quot;want to offer Jake Tapper questions to ask us&quot;. Which means they&#39;re going to have an interview where the guy being interviewed has already given the interviewer the questions they want the interviewer to ask. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The literal definition of <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=dictionary%20collusion">collusion</a> is </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is secret cooperation to deceive others into thinking that it&#39;s a nonbiased interview with a nonbiased CNN and a nonbiased DNC, with the interviewer asking actual questions instead of being no more authentic than a goddamn infomercial. </p>

<li><p>A CNN Producer asking a member of the DNC that they&#39;re going to interview if there are any points they want to make, and telling him they&#39;ll stay &quot;Dem focused&quot;, meaning they&#39;re going to focus on Sanders v. Clinton. Which shows CNN coordinating ahead of time with the DNC to attack Sanders in an interview.</p></li>
<li><p>A member of the DNC asking if there is any &quot;newsworthy oppo&quot; that can be brought up in the interview. &quot;Oppo&quot; is slang for &quot;opposition research&quot;. Have they dug up any dirt on Sanders that they can bring up in the interview. Which shows that the DNC was working against Bernie Sanders in the primary when they&#39;re supposed to be nonbiased.</p></li>
<li><p>A trio of DNC members are asked if they &quot;want to offer Jake Tapper questions to ask us&quot;. Which means they&#39;re going to have an interview where the guy being interviewed has already given the interviewer the questions they want the interviewer to ask.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The literal definition of collusion is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is secret cooperation to deceive others into thinking that it&#39;s a nonbiased interview with a nonbiased CNN and a nonbiased DNC, with the interviewer asking actual questions instead of being no more authentic than a goddamn infomercial.</p>

<p>You claim this is &quot;just standard interactions between sources and reporters&quot; and your coworker claims it&#39;s &quot;common knowledge&quot;. Great. Let&#39;s see all the emails made public showing the pre-interview arrangements between the media and the people they&#39;re interviewing. If it is standard, if it is a common and accepted practice, then there&#39;s nothing to hide. Let&#39;s have the interviewers and interviewees release to the public ahead of time, or even concurrent with the interview, the emails with the negotiations over what will and won&#39;t be discussed in the interview.</p>

<p>If those aren&#39;t open to the public, then they are <strong>secret</strong>. They&#39;re definitely <strong>cooperation</strong>, you don&#39;t dispute that. And if the image presented is that it&#39;s just an interviewer asking &quot;the tough questions&quot; to an interviewee, and we can&#39;t see what goes on behind the scenes to arrange those questions, then that image presented is <strong>deception</strong>.</p>

<p>Which makes it the dictionary definition of <strong>collusion</strong>. </p>

<p>Who said subpoena? If they aren&#39;t a secret, the organizations should have no problem <em>voluntarily</em> releasing those, in the interest of nonbiased transparency. If they have nothing to hide they have nothing to fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a difference between the DNC agenda to push Hillary and collusion to outright rig the primaries for Hillary? It seemed pretty obvious the DNC would go with Hillary 4 years ago, Bernie is an independent who declared himself democrat for the election. I guess my question is, does what the DNC did actually equate with rigging the primaries? Because political parties are a part of the democratic process, they&#39;re just another interest group and if you read the federalist papers, it&#39;s pretty clear they are inevitable and a side effect of the type of government we have. So as an independent institution, they have an agenda and Bernie was not part of it. Maybe I&#39;m confusing something but if someone could clear this up for me, that&#39;d be great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that fraud may be the one reasonable allegation, if the Party claimed to be neutral, leading Sanders supporters to donate to a campaign that was only allowed to continue for show.

Trump does seem like an asshole through and through but I prefer that to this darth sidious/emperor palpatine act that Hillary Clinton is all about. </p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t support Bernie either at this point because he is also quite obviously a sellout </p>

<p>Right, with the 1984 ref, but how is voting for Hillary vs Trump have anything to do with it? While people are busy trying to get a third party 5%, Trump may walk into the white house. When people say Democrats are the SAME and JUST AS EVIL as the reich wing, it makes me puke</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the most success bringing up problems that affect them, and bring up ways it affects them. </p>

<p>For example: someone who hates the current media monopolies, bias, net neutrality or is sick of not having internet/cable provider options - tell them about how the monopoly problem came about bc of Bill Clinton&#39;s <strong>Telecommunications Act of 1996</strong>. Clinton tried to sell it as a &#39;job creating&#39; and &#39;competition creating&#39; act. In reality it just fucked us over and moved media comp ownership from about 70 companies to just 6 monopolies. A repeal of the New Deal Communications Act of 1934. </p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s destroyed a lot of New Deal reforms, regulations, and relief programs that came after the Great Depression. I&#39;m a fiscal conservative - but know that these programs were vitally important to our countries economic growth and stability. Clinton undid a ton of them. Most catastrophic was repealing the Glass-Steagall Act - that deregulated Wall Street and led to the 2008 recession and bank monopolies. </p>

<p>TL;DR - use the Socratic method to lead HRC supporters to the truth that matters to them. Don&#39;t fight them or insult them, just speak about the points that matter to them. And why HRC will shit on those things that matter to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! It&#39;s important to open the dialogue. For older generations who are entrenched in partisan thinking and trust tv, it may be a harder battle. Always monitor your expectations on your audience. </p>

<p>In my opinion, I wouldn&#39;t argue pro trump - for ppl entrenched in est. media and haven&#39;t woken up, I&#39;d take this on slowly. </p>

<p>The most clear argument is playing the original Russia quote in full, and perhaps that whole rally - then play how top officials responded after spinning the story out of control saying trump is working with Putin to rig the election.  It&#39;s a great example of how fascist our media is. </p>

<p>I recently had success just telling my close friend who fears trump to just watch CNN as it is - the Clinton Narrative Network.  It&#39;s on nonstop in his office, and I told him to just look behind the curtain when he watched next time. Know that CNN is a huge Clinton donor, and a result of the TelComAct of 1996.  He volunteered a few days later, &quot;Omg, you&#39;re totally right, it&#39;s all negative trump news all day, everything about Clinton is skewed to her advantage, but it&#39;s mostly anti Trump hysteria&quot; </p>

<p>I was really pleased to hear that he took the time to look critically. The same way psychologists let ppl come to the realization/opinion on their own,  the more impactful. </p>

<p>Bernie was always too &quot;radical&quot;, meaning of course that the general population from both sides of the aisle loved him for his common-good policy plans, but he&#39;d be horrible for the Big Interests.... that decide elections.</p>

<p>The nomination was probably part of the package she was offered for dropping out in 2008, along with the SoS job.</p>

It is true that this type of bs has been going on for years, but it&#39;s more difficult to hide stuff from the public than it use to be.

    <div class="md"><p>Then you&#39;ll have no trouble showing us instances in which the collusion you allege actually had an effect on acquiring a second party&#39;s compliance in putting an illegal scheme into practice. I&#39;ll wait right here.</p>

<p>The DNC leaks do show the DNC staffers broke the organization&#39;s charter, which requires neutrality in the primaries. I think Sanders or his voters probably have legit civil lawsuits for fraud. But collusion and conspiracy requires evidence of two independent parties arranging to defraud. The most egregious of the leaks just don&#39;t show that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Thats basically what confirmed for me that he was the people&#39;s choice. The right choice. With all the cheating and downplaying the RNC did to Trump (i mean, look at what happened in Colorado) and he STILL won? He won against all odds, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING was against him, except for one thing, the people. The people were for him and the people are for him, he is the <em>only</em> candidate who is <em>for</em> us, so we are for him.</p>

<p>I may not be able to vote due to imperialism. But if i could, me,  and everyone that i talk to, would vote for Trump. </p>

<p>On another note, from the get-go, i knew something was off with Hillary, (too reptilian hahaha) and now im <em>convinced</em> that <em>she</em> is the number one enemy of the united states of america, its morals, its way of life,  democracy, the liberty and hope it supplies to everyone born on this earth. </p>

<p>I have never felt so negative towards a candidate, not even local ones. </p>
