        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve found footage of these cars, some melted down to their very frame, but there was no fire. It&#39;s mind-blowing. I&#39;ve listened to Dr. Judy Wood Speak about this; she seems to think there was technology behind 9/11 that helped to, as she says, &quot;dustify&quot; the contents of the buildings. </p>

<p>She ultimately comes to the conclusion that this technology is possessed by our military, and is not public knowledge. If you ever went inside the towers, you know how much steel and other metals were in there. All the elevators, door knobs, filing cabinets--everything. It was reduced to dust. Even with a combination of thermite or thermate and RDX or other explosives, the &quot;dustification&quot; of all these pieces is impossible. </p>

<p>Do you guys think that there might have been a technology used that day in combination with thermite and RDX to turn those buildings&#39; contents into dust? It certainly might help explain these cars that seem to have been (sometimes only partially) toasted but without fire.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever studied the Hutchinson effect, you understand that matter can be manipulated using a combination of frequency and magnetism. That might not be related to what happened, but it&#39;s just an example that there are some things we don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>I lost a family member that day. My cousin worked for an agency called Marsh Companies (you might know them as Marsh &amp; McLennan). His remains were never recovered.</p>

<p>I just want truth. That&#39;s all I want. That&#39;s my closure. More was going on that day than planes, thermate, and RDX. I want to know what we&#39;re not being told. That&#39;s my closure.</p>

<p>EDIT: To all the people going on and on about how I&#39;m advocating for some Death Star space beam, I DON&#39;T KNOW. That&#39;s my conspiracy theory. I am preaching the gospel of I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s ultimately why we&#39;re all here. But I will tell you one thing I do know--the debris from each tower should have been over 200 feet high, but barely peaked above ground level. Yes thermate was used. Yes RDX was used. However, that still doesn&#39;t explain how THAT much metal was turned to fine grey dust. If you&#39;ve ever been in the towers, you saw how much metal was in that building. It was an ungodly amount, and that&#39;s just in the parts I saw. 50,000 filing cabinets in each tower and only 1 was recovered, shriveled up to the size of a basketball and STILL had unburnt paper attached to it? Something more had to have happened that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Dr. Wood, there should have been a pile of debris over 200 feet high, even taking into account the underground portion. I saw ground zero from street level after only a few days with my own eyes. Not even remotely close. There was technology at play that day that is the stuff of science fiction. </p>

<p>EDIT: 
This is a comment I made from further down in the thread, but I think it&#39;s important that we all remember why we are here in this community. If we attack each other, it will destroy us.--</p>

<p>This subreddit exists because we see past the lies. We understand the histories of wars and we understand false flag events. We understand that war benefits certain powerful people. We understand that the current wars we are fighting are illegal wars. We understand that this is the way things have been since even before Waterloo where Rothschild financed both sides, then sent false reports of a Napoleon victory to England so that he could buy the country for pennies on the pound. We understand that the sinking of the Lusitania was encouraged the same way the attack on Pearl Harbor was encouraged. We understand the Federal Reserve and IRS. We understand fiat currency and fractional reserve banking. We understand that JFK attempted to print &quot;United States Notes&quot;, and that he vowed to &quot;Crush the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the wind&quot;. We understand that there were never any &quot;boys floating in the water&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin. We understand that we have been systematically lied to by those sworn to protect us. We&#39;ve read the Northwoods document. We know governments have no problem killing their own people in order to advance their agendas. We see these things. People think we&#39;re crazy, but we know better. The media has conscripted an army of individuals to discredit us, to label us as tin-foil hat wearing nuts, but we shouldn&#39;t care. We are in search of what matters most- truth. </p>

<p>Freedom is not more important than truth. Because to be free without truth is the freedom to live in a lie.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Also, this whole &quot;YOU DON&#39;T AGREE WITH MY WAY OF THINKING, THEREFORE YOU ARE A PAID SHILL, SHILL, DISINFORMATION AGENT, etc, has got to stop. We are all in this together. Not many people see what we see. Please can we keep it constructive? </p>

<p>Because the steel was &#39;evaporated&#39; like swiss cheese, the glass was undamaged, so were the tires (rubber).  Rubber melts before steel.  Vinyl on the dash warped but not melted; leather and upholstry undamaged.  Only the metal parts.</p>

<p>Also, there would be evidence of hydrocarbons, soot, ash, etc on the tops of cars--that would be imminently evident even from the photographs.  </p>

<p>That didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>The cars were up to several blocks away, where people (firefighters/police/ambulance) were.  They&#39;d have been hit by falling fiery jet fuel also.  None were.   People had no fear of this happening, nor had any idea a building could suddenly collapse.</p>

<p>Your entire explanation has at least 7 problems with it.  I mean, you can get real or you can continue to deny facts to yourself, thereby justifying the cruelty in the world both here and abroad that you yourself have helped enable by spreading disinfo such as this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rummy was questioned about <em>high tech weapons</em> being used/experimented <em>in theatre</em> by a female reporter...at the time Donalds left hand was heavily wrapped in a gauze<em>bandage</em>.</p>

<p>There were other reports that came out where people in Theatre were reduced to <em>child sized</em> corpses, where their skulls were decimated but oddly enough their clothing didn&#39;t burn.</p>

<p>There&#39;s Video testimony of the <em>telling</em> but no footage.</p>

<p>On 9/11 some odd behavior of those trapped in the towers: They were stripping off their clothing but not covering their faces? </p>

<p>In a fire, if trapped, you wet down what you can and get low, right? Many of the Victims that day were videotaped standing erect and stripping off their clothes.  Were they being Microwaved? </p>

<p>Kid, very few in here will admit that the massive structures of WTC 1 thru 7 were 
all compromised that day! There are available images of the entire Foot Print of the WTC PLAZA! </p>

<p>Seven buildings were <em>mortally</em> destroyed that day as well as the Deutsche Bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you&#39;re right about buildings 1-7. There are overhead shots showing the entire WTC compound demolished. WTC 6 looks eerily similar to the Oklahoma City Federal Building. The core was completely taken out and the entire building was gutted. The only thing keeping it standing partially were its supporting columns. 9/11 wasn&#39;t just about traumatizing America and the world and launching the PNAC agenda and gaining public support for the global war without end. That compound was targeted. We all know that building 7 housed the CIA&#39;s largest HQ outside of Langley, and some of us are aware of the El Dorado task force, an entity that might have exposed corruption at the highest level of the Bush administration. Other targets were the Department of Naval Intelligence, Marsh&#39;s Silverstream connection to AIG, among many, many others. </p>

<p>9/11 was the perfect crime because it killed about 400 birds with one stone. The entire plaza was destroyed because evidence needed to be destroyed within the chaos. I will always study that day not only because I lost someone, but because I&#39;m fascinated by it. I&#39;m fascinated by the way the highly-controlled media fed Americans the narrative written by the government and the people took it as fact without question. </p>

<p>9/11 was the culmination of the programming that took place in what Adam Curtis would call &quot;The Century of the Self&quot;. They won. Americans are in the palm of their hands. Their fear tactics have worked. 9/11 tested that--it was the ultimate test, and it was a complete success. </p>

<p>When you support Judy Woods you are talking about space beams. Like it or not you will always be supporting disinformation space beams with her. She&#39;s filed copyright violations on people&#39;s yt vids that debunk or question her and gotten them taken down or suspended for a short time she&#39;s a snake in the grass.

<p>The swiss cheese cars are evidence of an energy weapon, but they could be a misdirection.  It could be the case the cars had NOTHING to do with 9/11 and are used to tie future conspiracy people up in knots.

<p>You have a car that has been COMPLETELY toasted all the way down to its skeletal structure, and 2 feet from it is a car that looks completely untouched.

    <div class="md"><p>Look, arguing back and forth isn&#39;t constructive. Did you ever go inside the towers? If not, you can&#39;t appreciate the magnitude. There was SO much metal. And when those towers came down, it was fine grey dust. I&#39;ve researched this for thousands of hours, and at a point, the last thing I believed might be involved was some top secret military directed-energy weapon. But after combining my personal accounts with the lack of debris and the anomalous nature of these cars, science fiction (as far as we know) is the only thing that makes sense. Sorry if I sound crazy to you, but it&#39;s the truth. Cars were toasted a mile away. Some only partially (only the door handles melted off, everything else pristine, etc). Some are reduced to their skeleton, but the leather seats are in nearly perfect condition. The bottom line is that sure, some of the cars may have caught fire, but a lot didn&#39;t. That&#39;s what&#39;s scary. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get to the bottom of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yoooo but no one is saying it was &quot;space age&quot; technology. yes, there were planes that day. yes, islamic extremists were partly responsible. but those planes and the terrorists with box cutters were certainly used to take focus off of what really happened that day. i don&#39;t know what it was, but stop being a little bitch telling people they&#39;re &quot;not trying to get to the bottom of anything&quot;. this person lost a loved one to 9/11. our government let it fucking happen, new age technology or not. they financially profited from the death of thousands of americans, and they are, to this day, working with terrorist groups. god forbid someone who lost a loved one to this bullshit tries to debunk it. get over yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No proof or evidence, huh? The saddest part about what you just said is that the largest (or lack thereof) body of &quot;evidence&quot; was right in front of your eyes the whole time. Those towers should have left debris piles 20 stories high. But they barely left piles that were one story high. Again, if you never visited the towers, you can&#39;t appreciate the immensity. There was so much metal in those buildings. And that metal was turned to powder. The building would have had to be build out of RDX-mixed concrete to pulverize that much metal. And I think a part of you knows that, and it scares you. That&#39;s the natural reaction. We are afraid of what we don&#39;t understand. But something was at play. I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well could be. If you subscribe to the drone theory (that the planes that hit the towers couldn&#39;t have been the actual standard commercial jets due to their insane speed at 1000 feet exceeding the Max Flight Envelope by an impossible margin, so they must&#39;ve been modified) then the attachment everyone sees on the bottom is something called the Flight Termination System, and the small flash you see right before impact with the towers on both occasions is the module self-destructing. Those planes may have very well been equipped with some sort of energy tech. But not enough to vaporize the majority of the contents of those massive buildings I would imagine. The bottom line is that we just don&#39;t know. Anything is possible.There&#39;s no wrong answer at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is funny because the comment directly above is calling me a shill. Under ground thermonuclear demolition is how it was done. It&#39;s literally the only explanation for the way the debri pile was absent and the fact that there was molten steel found buried in the ground weeks after demolition. The explanation for the dust you mention is covered in the literature about the subterranean thermonuclear demolition technique. The detonation literally vaporizes a pocket of rock below the building, this is called the crush zone. The energy travels up the structure changing the thermodynamic characteristics of the steel and concrete making it very brittle, this is called the crash zone. This doesn&#39;t explain your cars to my knowledge, but it explains the absence of rubble. This isn&#39;t a theory that was cooked up to explain the towers, this is a preexisting technique.</p>

I will divulge one detail. My Cousin, Russ, made cell phone calls to his wife and mother. They had gone up to floor 90-something to get away from the smoke and fire pockets. He made the comment to his wife that there was no smoke and he could breathe fine, and the thermostat read 72, but no matter what he did, he felt like he was burning up. He said &quot;It must be 120 degrees in here. I&#39;m pouring cold water on myself but I just keep getting hotter.&quot; He was being cooked. I&#39;m convinced of that.

<p>But I&#39;m sure you sleep just fine knowing the 19 Arab hijackers were the ones who pulled it off. Open your eyes dude. There should have been over 200 feet of rubble from each tower, and it was barely above ground level. Where did it all go?</p>

<p>With weird ones, imagine them in their original positions close to WTC and what could have caused the damage there (surrounding car on fire causing door paint to melt but not touch interior etc).</p>

<p>People write books about this stuff, and then people write books with the sole purpose of debunking that book. And so on. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t seem to all be open-minded and tolerant. People react to certain hypotheses the same way most of America reacted to the Twin Towers coming down as they watched on CNN. They immediately deny anything except their own narrative. We conspiracy people can be very closed-minded, and no, the irony of that is not lost on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is I don&#39;t know whether the Hutchinson effect comes into play here at all. I simply used that as a precursor to the fact that there are just some things we don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>The video I provided shows a reproduction using electromagnetism and sound waves. A solid iron bar is mangled, shrunk, and its properties rapidly altered at the flip of a switch. Pretty interesting.</p>

<p>The general consensus, according to the massive amounts of literature I&#39;ve consumed and footage I&#39;ve seen is that the government is approximately 50 years ahead of the gen pop in terms of technology. This includes weapons technology.</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla was on to something. But his research and findings are suppressed. I personally believe that the guy who built the Coral Castle in Florida, USA knew something we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know. That&#39;s the purpose of this community. We talk about it. We keep an open mind and discuss these things. At least that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to be. Sad to say that isn&#39;t always the case.</p>

<p>This subreddit exists because we see past the lies. We understand the histories of wars and we understand false flag events. We understand that war benefits certain powerful people. We understand that the current wars we are fighting are illegal wars. We understand that this is the way things have been since even before Waterloo where Rothschild financed both sides, then sent false reports of a Napoleon victory to England so that he could buy the country for pennies on the pound. We understand that the sinking of the Lusitania was encouraged the same way the attack on Pearl Harbor was encouraged. We understand the Federal Reserve and IRS. We understand fiat currency and fractional reserve banking. We understand that there were never any &quot;boys floating in the water&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin. We understand that we have been systematically lied to by those sworn to protect us. We&#39;ve read the Northwoods document. We know governments have no problem killing their own people in order to advance their agendas. We see these things. People think we&#39;re crazy, but we know better. The media has conscripted an army of individuals to discredit us, to label us as tin-foil hat wearing nuts, but we shouldn&#39;t care. We are in search of what matters most- truth. </p>

<p>Freedom is not more important than truth. Because to be free without truth is the freedom to live in a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t argue with that. There&#39;s video on Youtube of Lloyd England, the man who had the &quot;light pole go through his taxi cab window&quot; as the &quot;plane knocked it over before flying into the Pentagon&quot;. When the camera is rolling, he sticks to his story 100%, but when he believes the camera is off, he essentially admits that he was recruited by the government through his FBI-employee wife to be part of a black operation to help stage the event. When he thinks the camera is off, he says something like &quot;Do you know what history is? It&#39;s not the truth, it&#39;s HIS-STORY. Look man, I didn&#39;t ask to be involved in all this, I&#39;m not supposed to be involved in all this. This is big-time, world event stuff. I&#39;m a small man. I don&#39;t need to be involved in this. This type of thing is for people with money and all this. That&#39;s not me. As long as that camera&#39;s on, we can&#39;t be seen crossing the street together.&quot;</p>

<p>So yes, Lloyd&#39;s taxi proves that things were planted. My only question in this situation would be, why the inconsistencies? If you toast a car but leave the seats unburnt, conspiracy theorists will have a field day.</p>

<p>Look up the video of Lloyd and his taxi. Hearing him stick to his guns so hard when the camera is rolling and then hearing him say the things he says when he thinks he isn&#39;t being recorded is pretty chilling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Everyone should watch the Lloyd England video. Especially folks who still believe the government narrative. I remember the first time I saw it. My stomach dropped. It proves that civilians were recruited, a plan was made for them, and they were sworn to secrecy under penalty of god knows what. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to oust Lloyd. After all, he was careful. He didn&#39;t DIRECTLY come out and say &quot;YES I WAS PART OF AN INTELLIGENCE BLACK OPERATION AND WAS TAUGHT TO PLAY MY PART AND NOW I REGRET IT.&quot; But if you can read between the lines, that&#39;s exactly what he said.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve researched what happened that day for most of my adult life. It is one of my obsessions, for obvious, and not-so-obvious reasons. I love my country, but the people running it have got to go. We need to listen to our founding fathers more. If we did, we wouldn&#39;t have a central bank, and everyone in power would be replaced from time to time to prevent the massive corruption we are seeing today.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">Environmental anomalies at the World Trade Center: evidence for energetic materials</a></strong> is a  Peer-reviewed scientific analysis of the environmental data collected at Ground Zero in the months following 9/11, that indicated that violent incendiary fires were occurring, that could not be put out, dispute millions of gallons of water being poured over the site and the use of chemical fire suppressants</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Investigators monitoring air quality at the World Trade Center, after the September 11th attacks, found extremely high levels of volatile organic chemicals as well as unusual species that had never been seen before in structure fires. Data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicate striking spikes in levels of benzene, styrene, and several other products of combustion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only thermite, which contains its own oxidant and therefore cannot be extinguished by smothering it, can explain this evidence</p>

<p>its likely that WTC1 and WTC2 had missing floors, no steel or concrete pans for much of its interior. hollow towers.</p>

<p>its also pretty obvious that WTC7 was empty that morning, no Saloman Bros or Citigroup (missing since 1999), no govt agencies working there at 6am or 8am. zero survivor stories from WTC7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well could be. If you subscribe to the drone theory (that the planes that hit the towers couldn&#39;t have been the actual standard commercial jets due to their insane speed at 1000 feet exceeding the Max Flight Envelope by an impossible margin, so they must&#39;ve been modified) then the attachment everyone sees on the bottom is something called the Flight Termination System, and the small flash you see right before impact with the towers on both occasions is the module self-destructing. Those planes may have very well been equipped with some sort of energy tech. But not enough to vaporize the majority of the contents of those massive buildings I would imagine. The bottom line is that we just don&#39;t know. Anything is possible.There&#39;s no wrong answer at this point.</p>
