    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is quite true.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, evolution isn&#39;t something to believe in or not believe in. It&#39;s more like a fact. We see it in the fossil record. Over vast expanses of time, fewer species become more species. Less specialization becomes more specialization. And it&#39;s clear that later organisms do derive <em>somehow</em> from earlier ones.</p>

<p>When a natural process leaves tracks that are plainly visible, I stop thinking about it in terms of belief or non-belief. :)</p>

<p>The next question is, how do we explain this phenomenon we see? And of course, our main way is that big and complex body of interrelated propositions called Darwinian theory (including neo-Darwinian).</p>

<p>Here, too, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s usefully approached as something to believe or not believe. The vast majority of us don&#39;t even know what it says. So how are we supposed to accept or reject it?</p>

<p>I&#39;d say, let&#39;s all learn some Darwinian theory first, and then we can make some decisions about it.</p>

<p>Even then, it&#39;s unlikely to be a believe/not believe, accept/reject kind of deal. The model is likely to be a useful approach to some questions but not all.</p>

<p>Edited to add (sorry, I got cut off): So the Darwinian model is much like any scientific model. Even though it holds up rather well within its domain, it could stand certain improvements, and of course it doesn&#39;t answer all the questions about life. The rational thing to do is to use it where it&#39;s useful.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I don&#39;t see Darwinian theory and <em>some kind of concept like Intelligent Design</em> as mutually exclusive. What I mean is, some principle or process that is more &quot;teleological&quot; than random mutation <em>may be</em> responsible for new variations that natural selection can act on. I strongly suspect that this is the case, even though science hasn&#39;t discovered or described any such process yet.</p>

<p>For a long time, Darwinian and Lamarckian theories were held to be mutually exclusive, with Darwin winning out and Lamarck being tossed out the window early on. About 20 years ago, I saw something that amazed me. A book came through our approval plan (at a university library) titled something like &quot;epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance: Lamarckian dimensions of&quot; blah blah something something. The book discussed a growing body of research that pointed to the validity of Lamarck&#39;s discredited idea, namely the inheritance of acquired characteristics.</p>

<p>All fields are chock full of this kind of stuff. Anyway, that&#39;s how I look at it, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got to be precise and accurate in your use of terminology, or else we won&#39;t know what we&#39;re supposed to be debating about. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you mean that <em>evolution</em> is a conspiracy. Evolution is a very broad term that means development-- and specifically, you probably mean development of one or more living species over very long timespans. Evolution is abundantly evident in the fossil record. The only way this observation could result from a conspiracy is if some supernatural being arranged the fossils this way in order to fool people. </p>

<p>What you probably mean is something more like: Darwinian evolutionary theory is a conspiracy. I do know some Darwinian theory, but I&#39;ll need you to explain what you mean by saying it&#39;s a conspiracy. </p>

<p>And of course, participants in this thread would have to know their Darwinian theory in order to discuss it meaningfully. I find that very, very few people have this knowledge. That&#39;s no knock on them. It&#39;s like any other highly technical discipline. Most people have no reason to study it. </p>

<p>It&#39;d be OK if it stopped right there, but a lot of people seem to think they have to render an opinion on it, and that&#39;s where we run into trouble. </p>

<p>This is a quote from the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the femur, the head is spherical and rotated anteriorly; the neck is elongated and oval in section and the lesser trochanter protrudes medially. While this suggest that Orrorin was bipedal, the rest of the postcranium indicates it climbed trees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder how they could use a small part of the cranium to determine that this animal climbed trees, this is probably just my ignorance of science.</p>

<p>I&#39;m skeptical of Europeans gaining lactose tolerance through a mutation. Mutations in general are harmful because they damage DNA, no new information is added to the genetic sequence during a mutation.</p>

<p>Is being able to digest lactose an evolutionary advantage? Galactose is found in sugar beet and you can get starch by eating potatoes.</p>

<p>Besides, it is impossible to prove that Europeans didn&#39;t always have lactose tolerance to some degree.</p>

<p>The mudskipper fish is around today, because it is able to live in both water and on land. My point is that a fish cannot go out of water and suddenly start mutating and survive.</p>

<p>Miller-Urey used a condenser with circulating water, they also removed products as soon as they were formed, this would not have been possible on a primitive earth.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t always damage DNA, but they can change DNA. In regards to mutations generally being harmful, <a href="http://www.gate.net/%7Erwms/EvoMutations.html">this</a> link lists just a few beneficial mutations that have been observed by scientists. </p>

<p>Chlamydomonas is a unicellular green algae capable of photosynthesis in light, but also somewhat capable of growth in the dark by using acetate as a carbon source.  </p>

<p>Graham Bell took Chlamydomonas and kept them in the dark. By doing so, he killed the Chlamydomonas that were not able to properly take in carbon from the acetate they were placed on.</p>

<p>The key thing is that Chlamydomonas are <em>already</em> able to survive in the dark.</p>

<p>All Bell did was simply get rid of those who can&#39;t fix carbon properly from organic matter.</p>

<p>If you got rid of all tall people, would you then say that humans have &#39;evolved&#39; to be shorter? Of course not. Evolution is about animals gaining <em>new</em> proteins, enzymes and organs. </p>

<p>Evolution is not culling organisms with certain traits.</p>

<p>Yet it happened anyway. You also can&#39;t take a sea fish and put it into fresh water, yet there is salmon which can live in fresh and salt water.

<p>You were stating there are no transitional fossils. Well, there are as you have seen and since humans evolved from apes then it would make sense that an early hominid would have  a similar brain volume to an ape.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re going to be told these are bad points. They&#39;re really not. Maybe overstated slightly. The wording could be tweaked. But you are pointing at real problems, genuine puzzles. I&#39;ve studied Darwinian theory extensively and appreciate its explanatory and predictive power, but unlike a lot of people who devote a lot of time and effort to it, I gladly acknowledge that it&#39;s got some gaps in it, and there are questions it doesn&#39;t even address. If I say this, I get downvotes from both the Darwinians and the creationists. XD</p>

<p>Anyway, have an upvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is complete bullshit. Not because it&#39;s morally repugnant, but because you mobilize the language of human population genetics without understanding or caring about that field in the slightest. If you ever did formally study it, if you grasped even its most basic principles and findings, these opinions of yours would immediately strike you as fundamentally absurd. I mean right on the face of the matter. </p>

<p>Tell me I&#39;m wrong. Tell me you&#39;ve done coursework in human population genetics, or hell, any population genetics. Off the top of your head, name, oh, let&#39;s say three of your favorite theorists in that field, or even in evolutionary theory in general. I&#39;m betting you don&#39;t have three favorite theorists in that field, and the reason is that you don&#39;t actually give a fuck about that field. You just misuse its terms in service to your pet theory, which is, yes, racist. I mean textbook racism. And strictly not supportable by science. </p>

<p>But hey, I could be wrong. So tell me. </p>

<p>Or if you don&#39;t give a flying fuck what science says, and you&#39;re going to keep believing what you believe, no matter how many current papers and books are cited to the contrary, then that&#39;s fair. I can respect that. Just say so. It&#39;s the pretense to scientific currency that&#39;s galling. </p>

<p>In case anyone is wondering why it&#39;s extremely hard to find any working research scientists in human population genetics who are also white nationalists, or black supremacists, or any kind of racist like that, then wonder no longer. There isn&#39;t any elephant in that room. The science simply negates any such concept of race. </p>

<p>For Asian Americans, a changing landscape on college admissions</p>

<p>In a windowless classroom at an Arcadia tutoring center, parents crammed into child-sized desks and dug through their pockets and purses for pens as Ann Lee launches a PowerPoint presentation.</p>

<p>Her primer on college admissions begins with the basics: application deadlines, the relative virtues of the SAT versus the ACT and how many Advanced Placement tests to take.</p>

<p>Then she eases into a potentially incendiary topic — one that many counselors like her have learned they cannot avoid.</p>

<p>“Let&#39;s talk about Asians,” she says.</p>

<p>Lee&#39;s next slide shows three columns of numbers from a Princeton University study that tried to measure how race and ethnicity affect admissions by using SAT scores as a benchmark. It uses the term “bonus” to describe how many extra SAT points an applicant&#39;s race is worth. She points to the first column.</p>

<p>African Americans received a “bonus” of 230 points, Lee says.</p>

<p>She points to the second column.</p>

<p>“Hispanics received a bonus of 185 points.”</p>

<p>The last column draws gasps.</p>

<p>Asian Americans, Lee says, are penalized by 50 points — in other words, they had to do that much better to win admission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for being nicer than me in your response. :-)</p>

<p>I am too personally harsh in my responses a lot of times. It&#39;s not constructive. I apologize for that part.</p>

<p>On to matters of substance. I&#39;m aware of old Watson! It&#39;s kind of hard not to be. He himself is kind of an elephant in the room.</p>

<p>I agree completely with Professor Steven Rose, who is also quoted in your Fox News article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steven Rose, a professor of biological sciences at the Open University in Britain, was quick to dismiss Watson&#39;s comments.</p>

<p>&quot;This is Watson at his most scandalous, &quot; Rose told the Times of London. &quot;If he knew the literature in the subject, he would know he was out of his depth scientifically, quite apart from socially and politically.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a reason we can say things like that with such confidence. It has to do with the <em>actual characteristics</em> of the entities under discussion: IQ tests, heritable/biological determinants of intelligence vs. environmental/developmental/cultural influences, the <em>actual genetic characteristics</em> of these different populations, and the operational definition of the term &quot;race&quot; itself (hint: as used here, it is a popular or folk concept that cannot be operationally defined in biological terms-- i.e., it is not a biological concept <em>at all</em>).</p>

<p>In terms of every one of these areas, these statements about genetics and race are strictly incoherent. They are not scientific propositions at all. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re &quot;not right.&quot; From a scientific standpoint, <em>they&#39;re not even wrong.</em> Anyone who studies psychometrics (like IQ tests) or human development or human population genetics understands these things immediately.</p>

<p>In addition, Watson does avoid a crucial error that I think is very common among people who believe that race stuff: he knows that aggregate statistics are not deterministic at the individual level. That&#39;s extremely important.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the next part, and now I see what your complaint is. I will agree with you here. The situation you&#39;re describing is <em>just absolutely fucked,</em> no doubt about it. I&#39;m a lefty who is left of Liberal, but I generally sympathize with liberal causes, and I do think that ethnic minorities (in the sociological sense of the term) have historically got the shit end of the stick in American society. So you&#39;d probably expect me to yell at you for rejecting this Affirmative Action crap, or at least &quot;yes-but&quot; it to death. Like &quot;yes it&#39;s unfair BUT...&quot; I know we do that.</p>

<p>So lemme quit that right now. No buts, it&#39;s just unfair. A travesty and a mockery. I oppose it. If that&#39;s your elephant in the room, then I see it too.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m against race-based discrimination, how can I fail to oppose this garbage?</p>

<p>I think affirmative action programs are an unfortunate <em>result</em> of thinking that race is an objective biological reality that determines anything. It not only fails to make amends for institutional racism. <em>It is institutional racism.</em> You cannot build policies that make sense on a foundation of false beliefs. Instead, you get crap like what you&#39;re describing here.</p>

<p>I see another thing that may bother you. I think you call it white genocide. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d put it that way, but I do see this trendy backlash against white people and European culture that is every bit as evil as any other kind of racism. I thought diversity meant we celebrate all cultures and all peoples. This is just shifting hatred around. So now it&#39;s cool to bust on white males of European descent just because of who they are? It&#39;s appalling, and I&#39;ve seen it. It&#39;s real.</p>

<p>After I sent you my nastygram up there, I was driving around, and I thought, I wish I&#39;d said that if you&#39;re proud of European traditions and culture, and you don&#39;t want it negated and denigrated and erased just because of the bad parts, or because it&#39;s now the fashionable thing to hate, then I say more power to you. You don&#39;t even have to justify that scientifically, with any statistics. You&#39;re proud to be of European descent. I wonder if that&#39;s ok to say in public these days? Anyway, thumbs up from me.</p>

<p>Thanks for a chance to see it your way.</p>
