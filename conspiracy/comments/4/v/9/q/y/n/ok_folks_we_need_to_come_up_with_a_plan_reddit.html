        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Censorship is a funny thing.</p>

<p>The notion invokes images of propaganda photos and homogenized imaging on telescreens. It invokes the concept of a totalitarian iron fist that has but one virtue compared to the present situation; it is in your face.</p>

<p>In order to effectively censor and control the narrative, relatively few things need to be actually controlled, and like any good virus, survival comes from not destroying the host.</p>

<p>Twitter and Facebook arbitrarily apply rules regarding hate speech, harassment and violation of privacy. They remove inconvenient &quot;trends&quot; from news feeds and &quot;autocomplete&quot; in searches as a form of soft censorship.</p>

<p>Reddit does then same and then shadow bans users from being able to communicate the always existing &quot;other side of the story&quot;.</p>

<p>Remember, when you are only hearing one side of the story, you are just being manipulated into buying into that narrative. Only with 2+ reference points can you triangulate something approaching reality; a more accurate map of the territory, if you will.</p>

<p>Google does the same with their search results and auto complete suggestions.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has been shown to be completely biased and controlled in recent years, removing cited and credible edits and information under the pretense of requiring &quot;consensus&quot;, while entries clearly crafted by a publicist are left alone, or controversial thinkers have heavily editorialized entries to damage their credibility.</p>

<p>Between Google, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and Reddit, the &quot;internet&quot; that most people use is under the control of people with vested interest in preventing you from hearing the entire story. Effective communication between people that aren&#39;t even necessarily dissenters so much as pragmatic or skeptical has been compromised to a degree of untrustability.</p>

<p>In addition to this, PACs such as Correct The Record and HBGary and Ntrepid have created software to generate hundreds and thousands of sock puppet accounts that fill threads with misinformation, uncertainty, party line propaganda and all in a way that sounds convincingly like an actual user. The numbers of these automaton users easily approach an amount that can cheat the various systems to generate trends or karma in an effort to organically manipulate the system. This offers a level of plausible deniability to the platforms; &quot;we didn&#39;t scam you, the system works the way it we said it does.&quot;
These bot armies tell the brainwashed what they want to hear to feed their confirmation bias, and keep the undecided and under-informed from feeling confident enough to commit to a point if view. They also exist in numbers enough to give professional victims the &quot;harassment&quot; they need to get attention, and MSM outlets something to point at to confirm their narrative as well.
Back when the Ashley Madison scandal went down, everyone focused on the &quot;who was cheating&quot; part and laughed when most if the female users were bots. The real scary part is that these bots were convincing enough to tell the actual warm blooded users what they wanted to hear and convince them they were human.
People still fall for the &quot;chat bot&quot; advertisements with little (if any) modern AI implementation through simple psychological manipulation. Loneliness, insecurities, defensiveness, etc.</p>

<p>We need a place to communicate or a way to signal that we are &quot;on the level&quot;. One might think of the Blade Runner tests, and this might not be too far off.</p>

<p>We also need to know that there is always a ticking clock counting down from when a platform begins to gain popularity to when they are viewed as a valid means for advertisers to gain money. Then the platform has to decide whether they will sell out and start being manipulated, or they will have other platforms labeling them a harbor for internet criminal activity and forcefully shut down.
That is to say, we must be prepared to be dynamic. The moneyed interests are never to be trusted implicitly.
We need to learn how to spot these things and how to educate other. We also need to recognize when we are outmatched by the brainwashing. Trying to convince someone that is unwilling to consider alternative viewpoints will only set yourself at risk. You will be labeled as conspiracy theorist, racist, antisemite, islamophobe, homophobic etc. Anything to brand you with a credibility removing label.
Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn again and rend you.
These people are essentially pure ego, not willing to consider that there is a difference between what the believe they and the world are and what reality is. They can&#39;t handle that they are wrong or should see things differently in any way. I am not certain that there is a way to change those minds without a slow deprogramming process based on the already employed manipulation tactics.
If Facebook suddenly stopped throwing propaganda into timelines, a large cross section of people would flee facebook in search of a place to be fed the propaganda they love so much. They don&#39;t want the truth, they want to be told they are the normal ones and that they are right. They want the hug box. They want the echo chamber.</p>

<p>A few months ago there was a post where a person made a modular 3d printed rail gun. I do not enjoy the idea that the logical conclusions for the state of things are either submission or violent revolt, but it is wise to be prepared.
Better to be a warrior gardening in a time of peace than a gardener dying in a war.
The significance of this rail gun is less about that specific design, and more the concept. 3d weapons aren&#39;t new, and the government is actively trying to regulate any firearm designs made by by 3d printers.
Our advantage is that they are only thinking in terms of gunpowder bullets. Bullets are always going to be an issue (if you play many video games you know this) because they are in limited supply. At best, if you have a rig, lead, gunpowder and new primers, you can reuse casings.
Weapons that do not require ammunition are great for those circumstances, but a rail gun uses magnetism to fire any magnetizable metal pellet at incredible velocities. Relatively quiet as well, in some cases. This changes the limitations away from bullets and over to power and batteries.
Solar powered battery charges or kinetic setups are becoming more available and I think this could mitigate some of that. There are also gaussian gun designs that aren&#39;t as powerful (yet) that use only magnetism.</p>

<p>Bottom line, we need to start figuring out how and where to share these ideas and information in a way that wont be censored or used against us. We need to stay dynamic and adaptive. We need to be creative with how we will protect ourselves in a sustainable way. If there&#39;s an actual revolution, it appear hopeless if you focus on militarized police taking everyone&#39;s firearms based on registries, and the looking presence of drones and fighter jets. However, the concept of a rail gun exists independent of form, and you can create one at home with the right perfectly available supplies that would be powerful enough to punch holes in heavy machines. There are all manner of other &quot;futuristic&quot; types of things that aren&#39;t taken seriously purely because no one has needed them yet with the availability of fire arms. Incapacitating sonic emitters could not only make a sound so grating and loud it could be considered weaponized, imaging an area denial security systems based on low frequency tones vibrating a corridor such that it is physically painful or otherwise incapacitating to walk on, or shakes vision so much they are effectively blind.</p>

<p>Anyway, it may sound ridiculous, but we need to think in terms of Walking Dead style scenarios. Not that there are zombies, but that we need strategies for survival in a situation where all existing resources have been eliminated and infrastructures have either broken down, or exist solely for the benefit of the &quot;party members&quot;. The guy on the Primitive Technologies youtube channel may be the only one left in the end simply because he has a recalibrated concept of shelter and food sources. </p>

Like a logical framework that any &quot;real&quot; person that doesn&#39;t have an agenda to push would easily respond to without thinking instead rather that a set of questions that someone can memories the answers to.
A decentralized platform sounds great, but we would still need to have an expectation that it isn&#39;t &quot;censor-proof&quot;...that type of hubris sunk the Titanic...and we need a contingency plan for migration from platform to platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Reddit - Big Brother is Watching You</em></strong></p>

<p>Here we go, me attempting to tiptoe around the hot potato! I have had my fair share of warnings...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> All the major Reddit subs are being censored extensively. It happens from behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information on Reddit. If your post contains articles or reveal crimes about the following subjects: The US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economic Data, Economic Inequality, Social Unrest, the Corporate Owned Mass Media or certain well connected individuals - if you do, you will become a targeted of their censorship. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Their favorite methods: 1) Algorithms that automatically detect specific wordings 2) Banning independent media outlets. 3) Subtle vote rigging. 4) Manual removal of posts. 5) Intimidation. 6) Banning of accounts. 7) Allowing Strolling by Chills &amp; Fund-its (it rimes!). It is a very smooth and professional operation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> Reddit has now fully established a core of loyal followers and employees. If they don&#39;t want you to see what is going on, you won&#39;t see it, by design not accident. We can&#39;t fully observe the process, nor can we tell the entities apart. We can make patient observations. We can take notes. Patterns emerges. We are not allowed to talk about our observations or criticize &quot;them&quot;, that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. Catch <del>17</del> 22! (<strong><em>Example:</em></strong> r/conspiracy)</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Reddit</a> has censored most of the independent media, with an increasing zeal, mainly because they are compromising the narratives of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. The alternative media punches holes in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, lies and polarization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5)</em></strong> Reddit has become a cesspool of irrelevant trivia and celebrity gossip. Like mainstream TV it is now merely there to distract and entertain us with stupidity. This is how Reddit are dumbing us all down, turning all the forums into a mere shadow of their former glory, echo valley&#39;s full of idiots padding each other on the back.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>List of Systematic Censorship Committed by Reddit (Corporate Owned Mass Media)</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Update June 2016:</em></strong> </li>
<li>Censorship of voter fraud in the democratic primaries, by Reddit.</li>
<li>Censorship of Clinton&#39;s secret server scandal, by Reddit. </li>
<li>Censorship of Deutsche Bank and Italian banks approaching bankruptcies, by Reddit. </li>
<li>Censorship of Central Banks by pumping billions (???) into the markets, by Reddit.</li>
<li><p>Censorship of ISIS/Al-Sham/Al-Qaeda soldiers moving from Turkey into Syria, by Reddit.       </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Update July 2016:</em></strong> </p></li>
<li><p>Censorship of news about Clinton and the DNC committing voting fraud, by Reddit. </p></li>
<li><p>Censorship of news about Syria and Ukraine, by Reddit. </p></li>
<li><p>Censorship of Turkish false flag coup, by Reddit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I will update the list on a regular basis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the shit. Doing the hard work for me. I am currently working on something in the same vein but not the same, if that makes sense... a cataloging of the various techniques and corporations involved.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also working on a history series of sorts that reflects how people have been manipulated en masse through situations analogous to this. I don&#39;t think that the censorship network have thought about the direct line drawn through a pretty specific type of event that takes place, otherwise I&#39;d say more, but I don&#39;t want to set off some kind of mass scrubbing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s mainstream and accepted and nothing will be done about it... that&#39;s the problem. What you&#39;re saying assumes that MOST people know how to reason critically.
Or you are assuming that most people are self aware to know when their critical reasoning skills are flawed. Why do you think that all of the &quot;healthy at any size&quot; stuff gained traction? People want to believe that they are perfect the way they are, so telling people to &quot;learn to reason critically&quot; will have a small few thinking &quot;yeah, I should learn that&quot;, and the rest will think either &quot;Yeah, you all need to learn how to reason critically&quot; or &quot;Who the fuck are you to say I can&#39;t reason critically&quot;. And nothing changes.</p>

<p>While the events are unfolding, and the FUD and CTR are being spread, that&#39;s when the appropriate action has to take place, and what you&#39;re saying is that eventually people will understand that some fuckery took place and think they&#39;ll know better when it takes place next time, but comfortable in the belief that they&#39;re too smart to be had so they don&#39;t question enough of what happens.
And while you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s almost mainstream, &quot;truthers&quot; is still used as a pejorative, just like &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; or &quot;skeptic&quot; or whatever else. You can&#39;t say something like &quot;I don&#39;t think that carbon is the only thing to blame for climate change...while we should certainly be MORE responsible and possibly eliminate all carbon emitting machines, there are planetary and galactic forces at work, waste treatment plants generate orders of magnitude more greenhouse gasses than cars do, and first world nations calling for a carbon tax have a vested interest in keeping developing nations from taking advantage of the same carbon emitting factories that launched them into the first world during the industrial revolution&quot; without being simplified to a &quot;climate change denier&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two competing factors at play here: scale of audience and relative trust among the active participants. There&#39;s no technical or social solution to this problem. You can&#39;t have both. </p>

<p>Reddit at large (meaning the defaults and larger subs) has a very broad reach yet a very small level of trust. We are confident that there are shills, trolls, censors, and rigged voting schemes that serve to obfuscate any real discussion outside of a narrowly defined window. You cannot really know who you&#39;re talking to, who&#39;s up or downvoting the comments, and what is being censored. </p>

<p>I moderate a sub with about 5,000 subscribers (~100-250 active) that deals with many of the topics that this sub does. We have a much smaller reach, yet a much higher level of relative trust. I don&#39;t know who the people I&#39;m talking to are on the other side, but I do know the thoughts and ideas of a lot of the more active users. We&#39;ve built up the community from the ground, and have developed a culture that respects common civility and critical thought. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t censor any content, though we do censor trolling and users attacking other users instead of their ideas. To my knowledge, the admins aren&#39;t censoring anything at our level. I&#39;ve not seen it nor heard reports of it. It&#39;s possible but I doubt it. </p>

<p>This sub is a mix between the two, but probably with a higher relative ratio of bad-faith actors. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I don&#39;t think censorship at this point is quite as absolute as your post seems to imply. At the high level, the FB/Google/Twitter/Reddit defaults level, yes, I do believe many topics are outright censored. </p>

<p>Yet at the more granular level, such as this sub and the one I mod, it&#39;s more about containment and distraction. They keep these smaller forums from leaking out by ridiculing them in the default subs, and they keep them divided by sowing them with plenty of disinfo to keep us arguing about which is the real truth. And by and large, that works. </p>

<p>I would suggest if you want to receive good info, find or start one of these smaller enclaves. If you want to disseminate it, it becomes much harder. They don&#39;t need to silence you; they just need to shout louder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The powers that be control by making order out of chaos.  If things go chaotic, they have plans to exploit the chaos and end up on top.  They love it when we hang our hat on a collapse of society type of scenario.  They own the media.  They can control the message and make our slaughter look like protecting the innocent and the infrastructure.  It&#39;s all about controlling us, via controlling our minds, via controlling our perceptions, via controlling our information.</p>

<p>We need to unite, not scatter and fight among each other for scraps.  We should look toward decentralized open source peer to peer based encrypted communication.  We need to communicate.  We need to be able to find out the truth.  We need to avoid censorship.  We need to be able to communicate with each other and publish without fear of punishment.  We can make such systems.  We just have not imagined and coded them yet.  </p>

<p>Text is cheap, 1 byte per character in fact.  We could make a peer to peer based forum system that stores many copies of the data on many PCs.  It wouldn&#39;t have to be the entire copy on all PCs, nor would it have to be just 1 copy on single PCs.  It could be perhaps 10 or 100 copies of the same data on 10-100 PCs.  The system can be setup to restrict traffic to small amounts over a period of time, so as not to abused by hackers or those sending big videos or images.  Alongside it could be torrents supported by magnet links, that covers the larger videos and images.</p>

<p>The forum could be setup in a format like reddit.  It could even have a nested hierarchy so that admins could setup their own tree within it to avoid damage.  For instance instead of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a>, it could be servicename/underground_underlords/forum/conspiracy.  Then if some entropy oriented spiritual anus (a corrupter) decides to shit all over the platform, at least underground_underlords still has good forum names available.  Perhaps even a consensus of banning corrupt trees could be employed to limit the size of the collective database.</p>

<p>Anonymity could be guaranteed within the system by employing something like TOR.  Also, non-anonymity could be supported by the bold to ensure a lack of infiltration of paid entropy oriented spiritual anuses, black holes sucking out value and adding below worthless shit, in other words useless eaters.  Sudo-anonymity could also be made with restricted access tokens as a form of authentication.</p>

<p>This whole thing would have a lot of parts, but its security could be held together by a cryptocurrency system similar to Bitcoin.  The system would ensure genuine authentication as well as reward participation in the offering of one&#39;s Internet bandwidth and computing resources.  Perhaps the use if ASICs could be deterred by requiring the participation of storing and serving the forum database.</p>

<p>It could run through VPNs if ISPs start actively blocking the service.  Perhaps other means could even be employed to circumvent ISP level censorship.</p>

<p>There are many other ways to do this I&#39;d bet.  We need to invent them.  If we get it done right, people will flock to it and stick with it.  It would be an evolution of Internet communication software that is far more immune to censorship and surveillance.</p>

<p>VPNs</p>

<p><strong><em>So many websites</em></strong> are blocking VPNs now.  This to me is evidence of the influence of these bastards.  VPNs have basically become unusable.  Even if you are on one, you either get blocked flat out or the website spins and is unreachable.  I believe they are fighting VPNs by DNS poisoning the VPN&#39;s nameservice provider (usually 2 servers).  It doesn&#39;t seem possible (that I&#39;ve found) to use your own DNS with VPNs, even if hardcoded in software (as in named explicitly in your internet settings)---it seems it&#39;s overridden.  </p>

<p>DNSCrypt similarly is attacked by state actors.  I tried DNScrypt on linux and it worked VERY well for about 2 days, then suddenly, without changing anything, it stopped receiving responses.  My guess is that the DNS server I was using was attacked and that service was stopped, likely with a DDOS attack on the dnscrypt port / NS ports, typically tcp/udp 53</p>

<p>Other DNS servers I&#39;ve used that aren&#39;t googles (ie not 8888 or 8844) are routinely nonresponsive, making it a kind of cat-and-mouse game of updating my dns list of free nameservers.  I refuse to use AT&amp;T&#39;s simply because like most ISP&#39;s DNS servers they are misconfigured and slow / problematic</p>

<p>My point is that some group is very adept at unpunished, unpublicized DDOS attacks, and I suspect it&#39;s the CIA and that&#39;s why they are using the AWS (amazon web services) or some other CDN like limelight or cloudflare ; you see with amazon, they can direct amazon to DDOS websites and servers using amazons botnet (AWS is effectively a botnet); and so they can takedown DCMA violators, subvert websites, etc. and they don&#39;t need Amazon&#39;s permission because they are the fucking cia and a mafia that can put a bag over Bozo&#39;s head and drop him into a river if he doesnt&#39; comply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use a VPN daily and rarely see it blocked. The key is to find a decent provider and change servers if necessary. The service I use has its own DNS server, and each server for their VPN service relies on a different DNS server of its own if not the service&#39;s itself. So there you go.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a DNS server to use, in particular, I would recommend <a href="https://cloudns.com.au/">CloudNS</a> with <a href="https://dnscrypt.org/">DNSCrypt</a>, <a href="https://www.comodo.com/secure-dns/">Comodo</a> or <a href="https://www.cloudns.net/main/">OpenDNS</a> (in that order).</p>

<p>If you want to take it a step further, you can chain / cascade VPNs, by connecting to one VPN (i.e. a private VPN) in your host/primary OS and then connecting to another (private or public) in a guest/VM OS; or take it a step further and connect to tor once connected to your (one, or ideally two) VPN servers, and primarily to encrypt any and all sensitive data, and to use a secure OS (i.e. a secure Linux distro, or if you must use Windows to at least run DWS prior).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theoretically, nothing. Except what if all mentions of a particular site are removed from existing platforms and suppressed from search results. And look at the reddit alternatives that cropped up... I don&#39;t see them mentioned here (which is why I&#39;m not mentioning the name for fear of autobot censorship), and the one I&#39;m thinking is borderline unusable because of how much of the content seems to be reactionary distillation of pretty extreme points of view. And for all we know, just like you can employ places like HBGary to have a bot army to SUPPORT a narrative, you could have a second bot army to create users on a competing platform to spew hate speech in an effort to justify a shut down.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll attempt to be cynical without being condescending. One aspect is recognizing that social media is just a conglomerate of shit other people produce. So, one option is to expect more of the producers. The other is to unplug and, instead of viewing Q &amp; A&#39;s with a preferred millionaire who has pre-planned answers (to pre-planned questions), engage in civil discourse off-line. Truly, all politics are local but many people are distracted from their own local level. So, those hopeful of a revolution may start there. This is where some form of impact can be made.</p>

<p>As for the consolidated media and profiteering social media sites, I believe there to be no hope. The owners of these operations simply have entirely too much money and entirely too much of a vested interest in the hierarchy. There&#39;s little hope in benevolent sociopaths tossing you a bone. </p>

<p>I suppose the scenarios you describe become most relevant when you want to take over the game and upstage said sociopaths. That&#39;s a very threatening situation to people who&#39;s entire existence is predicated on power. A different option, and one bewildering to the powerful, is to simply walk away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about survival in a situation where walking away is not really an option. To exist within this society you have to accept that you will never truly own the land on which you live and that you are really just a part of a people farm.</p>

<p>And I have unplugged from essentially all social media save for linked in, and that has nothing to do with opinions so much as it helps with work.
You are correct about the revolution starting at a local level, but that is still predicated upon a truly informed collective of people having the ability to communicate.
As far as the social media being shit other people produce part...to many in the world, that is just a &quot;real&quot; as real life, and SJW type support this notion the the degree that &quot;cyber bullying&quot; is taken too seriously to have the honest response be &quot;walk away from the computer&quot;. They believe whatever they see in their timeline/newsfeed as honest because they don&#39;t question anything, and when companies have created hundreds of sockpuppet accounts to give the illusion of a conversation in support of or creating doubt against something, it legitimizes things in their minds. They also have bullshit tv shows that marginalize any questioning as conspiratorial nonsense or fear mongering.
The greatest opposition to a revolution will not be counter revolutionaries. It will be the complacency of the uninformed and lazy that don&#39;t take anything seriously until they are lined up against the wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re likely discussing the same side of the same coin. My point is that moreover those aspects of society emerge because they are very specific to survival within all societies. It pays, at least figuratively, to be a victim because it subverts responsibility. So, its existence is neither astonishing nor unlikely to dissipate.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make a crude analogy in that its like a bunch of ugly girls hoping to get backstage with the rockstar. The rockstar will never let them in. Its always going to be the hot girls. But, for some reason, effort keeps getting made to be fucked by some demigod. I&#39;ll extend this analogy to anyone that equates appreciation from a boss with working extra hours or that a few simple tweaks will fix this society. Or even those feeling this society is even worth existing within.</p>

<p>In my opinion, we exist in an environment where a very lukewarm definition of revolution occurs. Some changes are made to the edifice but overall the end goal remains the same...the desire to become the demigod that is lusted after. I posit a shift in mindset must occur prior to true revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this. I think that the best systems work when you have 100% open source on information. When reddit makes a &quot;new algorithm&quot; they should be 100% transparent and show us how it works, code and all. Most people wouldn&#39;t read it, and if there&#39;s some kind of fuckery to be done, then there are improvements to be made.</p>

<p>I think that if most systems in business were completely open source, things would be better. However, I think that ideally, the world would be better if you could only export and import raw materials and not finished products, and therefor not labor, things would be better. Countries have different commodities in their raw form, and if something like Sony was required to have a factory in any country it wanted to sell the product, there would he less exploitation of workers, and jobs for more people. The various countries would also retain a value to others. Those without mineral resources would have more of an agriculture focus. If there were some countries that had a &quot;better version&quot; of whatever product, that&#39;s a quality control issue.
And hopefully that would cut down on all the bullshit that we don&#39;t need and never needed but were told we needed and now we can&#39;t live without.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s not bad but I would much rather a system that encourages us to use local resources as much as possible exporting technology more freely. A patent system that rewarded the creator while empowering entrepreneurs to use it to their full potential. 
that and finding systems that work for us as social animals. 
I mean imagine if we encourage free higher education supported and encouraged families. And not just in terms of producing kids but in a system that included our grandparents as much. I mean who better to run things than those with the most experience. </p>

<p>It&#39;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet">&quot;freenet&quot;</a>.  It&#39;s slow because no one cares about the project and so it hasn&#39;t improved.  It&#39;s largely considered to be some kind of enabler of child porn; but they say that about cryptography generally or any remarkably subversive tool.  Remember, it&#39;s a gun that kills people.

<blockquote>
<p>as a reddit that&#39;s built on bitcoin.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That way, revisions are always there and the hash (md5/sha512) of the text is stored in the blockchain; either as a memo, a color, so you know it&#39;s been screwed up or not.  Alternatively, the revisionable text could be encrypted, chunked, and then stored as micropayments to a bitcoin address that represents the wiki&#39;s article.  edit: The text could be cached in a database in decrypted cleartext storing the hash also, and that hash is routinely checked. If something happens to change that hash, you immediately know it&#39;s been modified / wrongly falsified in the db; and so you re-decrypt and re-store the database&#39;s cached copy.  Or the users&#39; wiki client is instructed to fetch a decrypted copy from the blockchain. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Anyway, it may sound ridiculous, but we need to think in terms of Walking Dead style scenarios. Not that there are zombies, but that we need strategies for survival in a situation where all existing resources have been eliminated and infrastructures have either broken down, or exist solely for the benefit of the &quot;party members&quot;. The guy on the Primitive Technologies youtube channel may be the only one left in the end simply because he has a recalibrated concept of shelter and food sources. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to think like this then start acquiring skills. The Primitive Technology guy goes out in his free time and tries all these skills and anyone else interested in learning such skills should do the same.  It isn&#39;t enough to have knowledge or equipment (though it can help) one must also have the experience of applying said skills.</p>

<p>When I was a young&#39;n my father was very adamant about me learning all the basic skills necessary to survive on my own away from the &quot;things of man&quot;. He believed that learning the hard way makes the easy way that much easier. I was 14 when I did my first solo survival trip. It was in the Trinity Mountains in late summer. My father dropped me in the back-country with a sheath knife, a compass, a topo-map, matches in a water-proof container, and the clothes on my back. We established a location for me to head to and I had nine days to do it. And I did it.</p>

<p>Some might consider that extreme or abusive, but my father prepared me with skills and knowledge before that. We did hikes and identified edible plants. We would go hunting and he taught me trapping and snaring (which kept me fed on more than one excursion). He taught me basic wilderness medicine (he was a combat medic in Vietnam turned pharmacist). All of this and more before I was dumped in the back-country. </p>

<p>So take the time to identify and learn all the skills that you think should apply, then go out and find someone knowledgeable and learn from them. Empower yourself with skills and knowledge and you will find that the stricture placed upon you by society can be easily shirked. Empower yourself and attain freedom, wallow in luxury and remain domesticated. ;-)</p>

My dad was a big believer in &quot;Murphy&#39;s Law&quot; (there are many but the primary being &quot;whatever can go wrong, will go wrong at the worst possible moment&quot;) and had a tendency to view it as the one universal law. He used to tell me &quot;Preparation is the bane of Murphy.&quot; I can tell you from personal experience that this is truly the case. It won&#39;t keep Murphy at bay, but it will reduce his severity by orders of magnitude.  Remember: Murphy abides, so be prepared. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take a look. It isn&#39;t just pedantry though. I have said this many times and people (or bots) try to misunderstand what I am saying... I am not opposed to discourse, but the most dangerous &quot;interlopers&quot; are the ones that appear neutral.</p>

<p>Think about how many times you have seen comments like &quot;I was a huge Bernie supporter, and I am no fan of Hillary, but we have to stop trump so it makes sense tor everyone to just vote for her&quot; or to be more meta &quot;look, I &lt;some kind of anecdote about how I am just a normal one of you folks and we have the same values&gt;.

<p>I was saying that assuming that <em>all_platforms_can_be_infiltrated_censored_or_shut_down</em> we need a strategy so that people that don&#39;t want to just lay down and take it can find each other and communicate when they are alone and unable to communicate through normal means.</p>

Otherwise, what is the point of all that wealth?  They don&#39;t really want to be Scrooge McDuck, jumping around in their gold coins all by themselves.  This is their weakness, because this same art and free expression can push people towards complete opposition to their policies and power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about the general problems you&#39;ve brought up. There&#39;s a fundamental flaw in any anonymous forum, electronic based in particular. It&#39;s that there&#39;s no reliable, scalable way of verifying a person&#39;s identity and attributing opinion or discussion to that person.</p>

<p>This allows infiltration, astroturfing, and general trolling. The only way I see around it is actual public discourse - as the Greeks and Romans used to do. This way the local population is aware of outsiders or &quot;troublemakers&quot; and knows to look critically at whatever they say. Likewise, community members who have displayed admiral moral qualities would be seen as having more credit to their &quot;name&quot;.</p>

<p>Could this system be implemented electronically? Possibly. But the problem of scalability remains.</p>

<p>Essentially, anonymity is both a boon and a bane. I&#39;m of the opinion that it&#39;s currently more of a bane - and it&#39;s being used quite effectively against the populous at large. For example, forums are easily infiltrated, public sentiment is manufactured at whim, and even our political voting is manipulated without anyone being the wiser. We just don&#39;t know what our <strong>real</strong> neighbors are thinking. And this is supposed to be a privilege?</p>

<p>If we are truly a democratic society with freedom of speech and opinion, we need to be mature enough to accept and understand wild differences of opinion among our brethren <strong>without hostile conflict</strong>. As it stands, it seems that we&#39;ve been trained to hide our voices behind a protective wall of anonymity - yet this wall has now been transformed into a cage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When all of a society&#39;s concerns were for the most part local, local public discourse was sufficient. The Athenians for the most part wouldn&#39;t have cared or needed to care about what was going on in the other regions of the Mediterranean, or even the other Greek city-states, unless it had to do with war or rumors of war. There was a bit of cultural exchange and exchange of ideas, through merchants and scholars, yet none of this was essential for their own city-state to thrive. </p>

<p>In today&#39;s world, the concerns are global. In the US, we cannot run our own self-sufficient communities without paying tribute to the state unless we are prepared to defend ourselves from the state, which we cannot. In other countries, they cannot hope to have democratically elected leaders without defending themselves from the foreign meddling of the US or other larger powers. </p>

<p>I think public discourse in person is important, and we should do what we can to increase it in our communities, but we still need a way to reliably communicate with others outside of our localities. Neglecting to do so makes us easier to control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that&#39;s the idea behind local elected officials. People who &quot;go to bat&quot; for local interests on the larger stage. I wonder if such a system worked better earlier in US history since local populations were much smaller. For example, a mayor might preside over a few hundred or thousand locals. Now we&#39;ve got mayors representing millions.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should have scaled up our representational structure to match population growth. Increase the number of local mayors to match the population? Of course, this does add to the bureaucratic burden.</p>

<p>In any case, I agree, but don&#39;t know how to address the larger communication issue without allowing subversion and misdirection to occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that we are all here and stare at these shit screens means we have already lost.  Man is meant to experience reality.  We have been hacked a long time ago and there is no way around it.  Man has become lazy and is satisfied with a virtual existence.  The ancient Greeks used to mandate that all citizens must go to watch the dramas.  It is the experience of viewing another&#39;s experiences and mistakes that shows our brain that we do not want to go down such and such a path.  It is our mind&#39;s ability of foresight that prevents us from living.  Many of us here foresee the future but we will not act.  We will just sit on Reddit and bitch about it, and then maybe go watch a Hollywood movie of someone saving the world and drink some scotch.  You know every civilization archeaologist&#39;s have uncovered has been found to ferment beverages.  Just more bullshit evidence of man trying to escape reality.  Let&#39;s all be honest that we hate this fucking place and we all have to pretend that reality is something which it is not.  That is the only way the mind can cope with it&#39;s abilities to understand and see the consequences of our actions.  There is no real escape, evolution cannot be stopped.  It is not us who is evolving by the way, it is technology.  Technology will replace us all, human&#39;s are obsolete creatures and the future is not ours.  The only way humans can survive (and we won&#39;t) is to become relevant in forms of physical competition once again.  We are physical beings and the body must not be treated separately from the mind.  The mind may want to believe in stupid shit like immortality but the body has evolved from constant cycles of death and rebirth.  We must embrace our mortality and nature (our true creator) if we wish to see our children have any future whatsoever.</p>

<p>Like an algorithm walks through tests to arrive at a conclusion, or anything else. We can&#39;t just set out to do something and expect to reach any good result.</p>

<p>However, of we conceptualize what a workable solution would &quot;look like&quot;, can arrive at an &quot;ideal form&quot; that nothing could ever actually &quot;be&quot; but would be close. Then we work backward to broader and broader generalizations of starting circumstances.</p>

Censorship is a funny thing.
The notion invokes images of propaganda photos and homogenized imaging on telescreens. It invokes the concept of a totalitarian iron fist that has but one virtue compared to the present situation; it is in your face.
In order to effectively censor and control the narrative, relatively few things need to be actually controlled, and like any good virus, survival comes from not destroying the host.
Twitter and Facebook arbitrarily apply rules regarding hate speech, harassment and violation of privacy. They remove inconvenient &quot;trends&quot; from news feeds and &quot;autocomplete&quot; in searches as a form of soft censorship.
Reddit does then same and then shadow bans users from being able to communicate the always existing &quot;other side of the story&quot;.
Remember, when you are only hearing one side of the story, you are just being manipulated into buying into that narrative. Only with 2+ reference points can you triangulate something approaching reality; a more accurate map of the territory, if you will.
Google does the same with their search results and auto complete suggestions.
Wikipedia has been shown to be completely biased and controlled in recent years, removing cited and credible edits and information under the pretense of requiring &quot;consensus&quot;, while entries clearly crafted by a publicist are left alone, or controversial thinkers have heavily editorialized entries to damage their credibility.
Between Google, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and Reddit, the &quot;internet&quot; that most people use is under the control of people with vested interest in preventing you from hearing the entire story. Effective communication between people that aren&#39;t even necessarily dissenters so much as pragmatic or skeptical has been compromised to a degree of untrustability.
In addition to this, PACs such as Correct The Record and HBGary and Ntrepid have created software to generate hundreds and thousands of sock puppet accounts that fill threads with misinformation, uncertainty, party line propaganda and all in a way that sounds convincingly like an actual user. The numbers of these automaton users easily approach an amount that can cheat the various systems to generate trends or karma in an effort to organically manipulate the system. This offers a level of plausible deniability to the platforms; &quot;we didn&#39;t scam you, the system works the way it we said it does.&quot; These bot armies tell the brainwashed what they want to hear to feed their confirmation bias, and keep the undecided and under-informed from feeling confident enough to commit to a point if view. They also exist in numbers enough to give professional victims the &quot;harassment&quot; they need to get attention, and MSM outlets something to point at to confirm their narrative as well. Back when the Ashley Madison scandal went down, everyone focused on the &quot;who was cheating&quot; part and laughed when most if the female users were bots. The real scary part is that these bots were convincing enough to tell the actual warm blooded users what they wanted to hear and convince them they were human. People still fall for the &quot;chat bot&quot; advertisements with little (if any) modern AI implementation through simple psychological manipulation. Loneliness, insecurities, defensiveness, etc.
We need a place to communicate or a way to signal that we are &quot;on the level&quot;. One might think of the Blade Runner tests, and this might not be too far off.
We also need to know that there is always a ticking clock counting down from when a platform begins to gain popularity to when they are viewed as a valid means for advertisers to gain money. Then the platform has to decide whether they will sell out and start being manipulated, or they will have other platforms labeling them a harbor for internet criminal activity and forcefully shut down. That is to say, we must be prepared to be dynamic. The moneyed interests are never to be trusted implicitly. We need to learn how to spot these things and how to educate other. We also need to recognize when we are outmatched by the brainwashing. Trying to convince someone that is unwilling to consider alternative viewpoints will only set yourself at risk. You will be labeled as conspiracy theorist, racist, antisemite, islamophobe, homophobic etc. Anything to brand you with a credibility removing label. Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn again and rend you. These people are essentially pure ego, not willing to consider that there is a difference between what the believe they and the world are and what reality is. They can&#39;t handle that they are wrong or should see things differently in any way. I am not certain that there is a way to change those minds without a slow deprogramming process based on the already employed manipulation tactics. If Facebook suddenly stopped throwing propaganda into timelines, a large cross section of people would flee facebook in search of a place to be fed the propaganda they love so much. They don&#39;t want the truth, they want to be told they are the normal ones and that they are right. They want the hug box. They want the echo chamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say whatever you want about the weapons thing, but as I said, I&#39;d rather be non-violent. But it&#39;s better to be prepared to protect yourself and never need to act, than to be unprepared and only have the option to submit.
If you think think that shouldn&#39;t be considered, then you haven&#39;t read about Turkey in the last weeks.
If you think it&#39;s crazy to think that the government would ever take weapons away, sure they aren&#39;t doing it right now, but look at what happened during Hurricane Katrina. The National Guard took plenty of weapons away from entire blocks of residents just to make sure they didn&#39;t have them.
And the point of what I said about weapons anyway is to point out that we need to be thinking of creative solutions to problems instead of restricting our thinking to solutions that have already been presented to us.
How about this...Think about the Walking Dead again... How are they washing their clothes? They aren&#39;t really, and that might not seem like that big of a deal, but they gloss over some things. In the civil war, there was a huge problem with grey back ticks and other parasitic insects infecting people. What about socks? In the Vietnam war, they had to constantly change socks because of various fungal infections that could eventually render you immobile. How would you prevent any number of infection scenarios from taking place coming from a fairly sanitized society?
In the US most everyone has central heat and air. How well would you be acclimated to living IN YOUR OWN CITY without these things? Inside a house with no AC in Texas is deadly; the entire house heats up from the sun hitting the shingles and becomes unbearable. If you don&#39;t believe me, go into your attic and hang out in the summer time.
Food can&#39;t be stored for very long without refrigeration and most people don&#39;t think about how you don&#39;t have to refrigerate things that are still on the vine or living in the ground. Most of what you see in a revolution type scenario is either remarkably peaceful, like you may be thinking, where there is no violence (if you think that&#39;s possible, show me one historical precedent that isn&#39;t a huge exception) or it shows a scenario where people are starving for lack of grocery stores, and defenseless for lack of guns and ammo.
I&#39;m saying that if you only think in terms of guns and ammo and even bows and arrows, you&#39;re still creating a huge blind spot, and that can be a metaphor for all sorts of things.</p>
