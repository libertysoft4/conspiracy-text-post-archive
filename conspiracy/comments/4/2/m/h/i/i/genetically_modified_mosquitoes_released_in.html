        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This seems like a case to me where mankind&#39;s arrogance may have backfired on us.</p>

<p>Here is Oxitec back in 2015 proudly announcing that their GM mosquito has decimated the local mosquito population in a field trial:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.oxitec.com/press-release-oxitec-mosquito-works-to-control-aedes-aegypti-in-dengue-hotspo/">http://www.oxitec.com/press-release-oxitec-mosquito-works-to-control-aedes-aegypti-in-dengue-hotspo/</a></p>

<p>Releases of the genetically engineered Oxitec mosquito, commonly known as ‘Friendly Aedes aegypti’, reduced the dengue mosquito population in an area of Juazeiro, Brazil by 95%, well below the modelled threshold for epidemic disease transmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/img/locator/city/049/1249-juazeiro-do-norte-locator-map.jpg">Here</a> is a map showing where Juazeiro is located.</p>

<p><a href="http://outbreaknewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brazil.png">Here</a> is a map showing where all the deformed babies are being born.</p>

<p>Zika was first confirmed in Brazil in may of 2015, but had been seen in other nations before. Question: Why didn&#39;t it cause an epidemic of birth defects in any other countries? How exactly would you miss a tenfold increase in children born with most of their brain missing? Zika in Brazil does not seem to behave like the Zika we were familiar with before.</p>

<p>How could the Zika catastrophe be linked to genetically modified mosquitoes? </p>

<p>The OX513A strain of male mosquitoes released in Juazeiro creates larvae that normally die in the absence of antibiotics, which is supposed to help decimate wild mosquito populations when these males are released in the wild. Problem here being of course, that &quot;life, uh, finds a way&quot;. <a href="http://www.econexus.info/publication/release-gm-mosquito-aedes-aegypti-ox513a">An estimated 3-4% of the larvae survive to adulthood in the absence of the tetracycline antibiotic</a>. These larvae should then be free to go on and reproduce and pass on their genes. In fact, they may be the only ones that are passing on their genes in places that have their wild mosquito population decimated by these experiments.</p>

<p>What is the effect on these mosquitoes that grow up with a mutilated genome? It is thought that this should introduce a fitness cost, that is, they should have greater difficulty surviving. What do we know about these mosquitoes? Has adequate research ever been done on how a genetically mutilated mosquito copes with viral infections? Could the mosquito be more susceptible to certain pathogens, that it then passes on to humans? If a pathogen like the Zika virus can thrive in the mosquito without restraint, it could evolve into something far more dangerous than its original incarnation, pulling the lever on the slot machine with every replication until it hits the genetic jackpot.</p>

<p>Is it too much to ask for a moratorium on these type of genetic experiments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say meddling with nature I obviously mean meddling in a way that nature couldn&#39;t have done so by itself.
It is one thing to cross breed animals and see what happens on a slow natural level but it is a completely different ball game when we induce sudden mutations that could never have happen, not even accidentally. 
See the difference there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t very educated are you? There is nothing special about these mutations that prevents them from happening naturally. You really have no idea what you are talking about. It&#39;s in no way a &quot;completely different ball game&quot; DNA is DNA. Just like pure H2O is the same as pure H2O from a hot springs. Same makeup and everything. Pretty basic chemistry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately for you I actually have a BSc [hons] degree in a biological field and worked for many years in pharmaceuticals. I am no microbiologist, there you are spot on. 
But DNA is not made up of H2O. It is made up of base pairs of nucleotides, which in themselves are made up of sugars and phosphates. </p>

<p>Now, with DNA the old saying is true that the sum is bigger than its components. I do not want to give you a lecture, because you are so highly educated already, but do you know what happens when there is a sudden mutation within the DNA? Do you know how it translates to the RNA and hence to the whole building plan? </p>

<p>Do you know how rarely there are mutations that work? 
Not very often. Usually when ONE organism has a mutation in their DNA, they usually die because the mutation is unviable.</p>

<p>IF and that is a big IF, they survive and reproduce they MAY pass on this mutation, which still MAY correct itself OR if it is actually useful, it COULD get passed on. This procedure will take many many generations to actually spread through a whole species.</p>

<p>What humans have done is cheat nature and evolution, by suddenly releasing a mutation into the wild, which had no chance to be &#39;tested&#39; by nature in order to see what impact it will have.</p>

<p>[Just for you , I explain: One sudden natural mutation, compared to a million manmade].</p>

<p>Now, in all your wisdom please tell me how this is natural? There is ABSOLUTELY no way where suddenly a million mutations could happen naturally and be alive from one day to another. </p>

<p>And please remember DNA is NOT made out of water. LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know that.  I said that &#39;establishing&#39; the mutations will usually fail as they are mostly either useless or detrimental. Once good enough to emerge in offspring, it still takes several generations for it to establish itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What humans have done is cheat nature and evolution, by suddenly releasing a mutation into the wild, which had no chance to be &#39;tested&#39; by nature in order to see what impact it will have.&quot;</p>

<p>There is an erroneous assumption in this statement that somehow &quot;nature&quot; will &quot;cleanse&quot; species of ostensibly bad mutations. The key assumption is that these mutations are objectively &quot;bad.&quot; The problem is that many mutations are bad only in certain situations (or good in certain situations and any variation on that theme) which is why you see situations like the buildup of neutral mutations that end up being extremely beneficial in particular environments, or exaptations, etc. My point is that what is &quot;fit&quot; for one organism is not the same for another and it is highly dependent on environment and time (especially as the environment is changing--see Red Queen hypothesis). </p>

<p>You appear to be implying that some sort of &quot;outside&quot; selection, that has nothing to do with humans, needs to remove the mutations. Because of the above reasons, that most likely would not case. We don&#39;t see this in real life. The arsenic in apple seeds is bad for humans but it is good for the plant. Natural selection did not eliminate that mutant because it was bad for humans. There are plenty of organisms that have &quot;mutants&quot; or traits that are bad for us but good for the organism. Natural selection might even preserve those traits! </p>

<p>Also, you appear to be suggesting that the selection on a plant is depending on where the mutation came from. In the hypothetical situation of, let&#39;s say, a rogue plant, once it is released, it is then &quot;tested&quot; by nature. How is that different from a mutation spontaneously occurring in a seed? Once a mutation appears/exists, it is by definition in the wild. If you had two plants with the same traits but one was made in a lab and one was mutated &quot;naturally,&quot; they&#39;d still have the same phenotype and thus are acted upon by natural selection/the environment in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>If you are implying that somehow selection on humans by this mutation needs to happen, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Whether the mutation in X organism came from a lab or arose naturally, if it affects human populations, it still will. You would still see the negative effect on humans, the same one the supposed GMO would have. For example, let&#39;s say some berry was mutated and now it creates some poison. If a person eats it, they die. If the berry was modified to have the poison mutation in the lab, it would still kill the person. If the berry appears in nature, it would still kill the person. No matter what the original mutation source was, the selective pressure on either the pathogen or humans would be the same because the phenotype is the same (i.e. making X amount of X poison).</p>

<p>Additionally if you think large scale mutations can result in pathogens that severely decrease our numbers; it is a possibility (which is why I don&#39;t support that new controversial research where scientists engineer new flu variants to make new vaccines--airborne pathogens are just way too transmissible to mess around with IMO) but there are also &quot;natural&quot; pathogens that have high lethality, like ebola, as a fairly successful virulence strategy.</p>

<p>&quot;[Just for you , I explain: One sudden natural mutation, compared to a million manmade].&quot;</p>

<p>But a &quot;million... mutations&quot; DO happen in nature. See speciation by polyploidy in Asteraceae or whole genome duplication events as hypothesized in teleost fishes (there are signatures in the vertebrate genome that suggest vertebrates underwent a whole genome duplication event--mainly that many genes occur in multiples of 4--you would expect a high number of genes in multiples of 3 if most copies arose via normal gene duplication via transposons). Additionally there have been plenty of chromosomal mutations that duplicate part of a chromosome, taking adding a bunch of new mutants (and yes different copy number count as mutations). There are a few examples if you compare chromosomes of primates.</p>

<p>And for the record, I was a PhD student in evolutionary biology at a top 20 research uni but Mastered out (There was drama in my lab--long story. I&#39;m going to complete it elsewhere.). I also volunteered as an undergrad for a very short time in a lab looking for genes to be used in GMO plants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m personally pretty skeptical about the claims here, but you are the person who&#39;se made the most incorrect claim I&#39;ve read so far. Your claim that DNA is just DNA is too simplistic, and because of that you&#39;re just wrong. The way that most modifications on non-bacteria are made is by using either a polymerase or virus and then inserting an active sequence of DNA. </p>

<p>A few major concerns pop up with lab genetic modifications vs natural modification
Firstly, most of the methods lead to DNA which is orders of magnitude more unstable than normal DNA, leading to horizontal transfer across the genome. This is in part due to the tails used needing to initially bind with foreign DNA, since they had to once readily unbind from something else for the initial implanting they are generally much more prone to repeating that later.</p>

<p>Another effect is that promotion is much more poorly regulated in GMO than natural mutations, since in nature besides base sequence there are steric effects that lead to proper regulation of promotion.  These genes have sequences called promoters which bind due to some stimuli, and this binding allows for gene readout to begin after it. 
In viral techniques, there is a growing concern since it seems that in some cases active viral genes is also transferred to the organism. Sometimes it&#39;s because we thought they were inert, other times its just carelessness. </p>

<p>For animals the two primary sources of mutation are a single base pair being incorrectly replaced, or an extra insertion of a base pair. Both are much less likely to result in adverse steric effects and the cell can trigger aptosis if the error is particularly egregious. If not aptosis, then it still has to get through natural selection if a gamete mutated poorly. GMO is a very interesting technology, heck I&#39;ve done bacterial genetic modification before, but I think it&#39;s far too underdeveloped a field for people to foolishly claim that it&#39;s indistinguishable from nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The risk of mutation is still present in a regular organism. It&#39;s far too paranoid to assume that somehow GMOs are going to automatically be more dangerous when random mutations can also have just as much danger potentially. It&#39;s not proper risk assessment to place such an emphasis on GMOs. It&#39;s still DNA and chunks of DNA in a &quot;natural&quot; organism can behave similarly too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that scale probably has a large impact, and the degree of control we now have over the mutations.</p>

<p>It was not previously possible to directly splice DNA together, but you could get pretty close most of the time with crude methods.</p>

<p>Likewise it was also not previously possible to introduce hundreds of thousands of instances of the exact mutation at the same time, nor reproduce the exact mutation millions of times in a lab and have them all ready to be released at the same time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are particularly wrong, but I would not say that the degree of manipulation we are able to do now, is anywhere near what can happen naturally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really good post. Great job, OP.</p>

<p>We do have to remember that correlation doesn&#39;t mean causation. It could be tied to the realease of these genetically modified mosquitos, but rather than the genome being the culprit it could simply be the mass amount of mosquitos released drove up the rate of infection in mosquito communities. Competition could have driven out infected mosquitos to repopulate other areas which then led to more zaka virus infections in humans.</p>

<p>Either way, I think you are correct in the release of genetically modified mosquitos being to blame for this increase in Zaka virus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The information presented here is incorrect. Assuming the article tries to establish a connection between the release of the GM mosquito and Zika related Microcephaly cases, the geography is way off.</p>

<p>There were two releases of the mosquito: <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/dengue-fighting-mosquitoes-are-suppressing-wild-populations-brazil">http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/dengue-fighting-mosquitoes-are-suppressing-wild-populations-brazil</a></p>

<p>2011 in Itaberaba: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Itaberaba,+Juazeiro+-+BA,+Brazil/">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Itaberaba,+Juazeiro+-+BA,+Brazil/</a> &amp; April 2015 in Piracicaba: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Piracicaba,+SP,+Brazil/">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Piracicaba,+SP,+Brazil/</a></p>

<p>Here is the map for Zika related Microcephaly cases: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/X284kJT.png">http://i.imgur.com/X284kJT.png</a>, (extrated from page 7 of <a href="http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/zika-microcephaly-Brazil-rapid-risk-assessment-Nov-2015.pdf">http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/zika-microcephaly-Brazil-rapid-risk-assessment-Nov-2015.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>As you can see the geographical proximity between the two is way off, not by cities, but by states. Thus it is improper to suspect these GM mosquitos have any relation to Zika related Microcephaly cases with the evidence presented in this article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you’re one of those people terrified by the prospect of GMOs in your food supply, you’ll likely be even more terrified by a planned experiment in the Florida Keys: releasing millions of GMO mosquitoes near a residential neighborhood to neutralize particularly nasty strains of two potentially deadly tropical diseases — dengue and chikungunya — <strong>that are growing threats in the United States.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were 11 cases of chikungunya in all of Florida in 2014, doesn&#39;t seem like much of a growing threat to me. When the establishments top mouthpiece, The Washington Post says we should all hope to get bit by a GM mosquitoes, it really means we should all hope NOT to get bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I must say I am a staunch GMO supporter, and while this post does point out an interesting coincidence, but there is a lack of biology/genetics to back this up. All that was done here is raise some questions of some importance, and as someone else pointed out, correlation does not mean causation.</p>

<p>In a lot of ways, it underscores the need for some sort of mosquito population control- GMO or not. A more simple (and likely, in my opinion) is that the GMO mosquito failed to control the population in time to prevent this outbreak from occurring. Viruses mutate very rapidly, and this attempt at curbing the mosquito population growth may have failed, or just altogether come too late.</p>

<p>Alas, the heart of the former conspiracy theorist in me does go a fluttering when I read this, but the skeptic in me finds it lacking at this time. While I&#39;m no authority, I will need to see more evidence than this. Like I said, it is a coincidence that the place where the GMO mosquito was released is where this mosquito-born viral outbreak seems to have approximately started. But with consideration to the idea that where you would release GMO mosquitos would likely be one of these &quot;high-risk&quot;/mosquito populated areas, it does seem to explain why these two events would co-occur: simply because there are a lot of disease bearing mosquitos there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is quite possible for viral pathogens to pick up DNA/RNA (depending on what it&#39;s core is) from hosts and even transfer its own DNA into the hosts permanently. This can be seen with human DNA having about 7% viral components from past infections (distant past). One can then surmise without too much difficulty that this is happening from the wild-type Zika with the GM mosquito and being passed from them into us and again placing their DNA into ours. So picking up that GM DNA and having it incorporated into its own strand and then ours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple explanation is: There&#39;s a bad mosquito problem in this part of Brazil. Mosquitoes transmit diseases like dengue fever. They released GM mosquitos in this area to fix the problem which are supposed to die early. Unfortunately, they survived because of tetracycline in the environment. So the GM experiment failed and the mosquito problem is still a problem. Now there is spread of another mosquito-borne virus, Zika. </p>

<p>Basically all these two independent facts mean is that this is the epicenter of mosquito activity in Brazil. </p>

<p>Zika, 4 strains, fully sequenced, 2016 from the Center for Technological Innovation, Brazil</p>

<p>The releases of GM mosquitos took in 2011 and 2012, fortunately people sequenced zika before that</p>

<p>Zika 01-AUG-2006</p>

<p>So lets compare. This isn&#39;t anything amazing, the viruses are tiny, this is rare in biology but we can actually eyeball the data since you could fit a whole viral genome on a single A4 sheet of paper.</p>

<p>View the alignment online:
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolresult.ebi?jobId=mview-I20160203-123326-0036-25505577-pg">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolresult.ebi?jobId=mview-I20160203-123326-0036-25505577-pg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/alnviz/results/8144137">http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/alnviz/results/8144137</a></p>

<p>If you take a peek at the last 2 links you can see that while they&#39;re not identical since viruses change over time naturally the differences are almost all small changes with no big new chunks of code added.</p>

<p>From a quick scan through eyeballing it, the only chunk of new bases was a 15 base sequence that doesn&#39;t show up in any piggyBac.</p>

<p>Zika is small, only 10,000 bases long and it&#39;s hard to hide anything big in it.</p>

<p>piggyBac is not tiny, ( <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=piggybac">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=piggybac</a> ), you wouldn&#39;t have to do any amazing analysis to see that it&#39;s not been added in there.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to trust me, look for yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have other critical thoughts on genetically modified mosquito. </p>

<p>What about the shift in food chain caused by releasing gm mosquito? I feel that has effect like dropping  a nuclear bomb - changing natural environment microbiology a lot. </p>

<p>A lot&#39;s of bacteria and viruses which were interacting outside of human eye went out. And new ones, deprived before at the place or carried from distant places will find it&#39;s new home there. The result can be (behind the other) a rise of new mosquito tribe which carry and transmit some new shit in their blood.</p>

<p>Well those species are not new. I bet zika virus and aedes mosquito exist for milleniums but it&#39;s rare appearence near human places makes it come noticed only by special interest virusologists. But now those new species become celebrity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s still uncertain for me if zika outbreak caused directly or indirectly by gm mosquitos or not. And i feel it will not be easy to find out the truth because of strong  grant-driven-motivation behind this story.</p>

<p>Is it too much to ask for a moratorium on these type of genetic experiments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst I understand your caution, this type of thinking basically ends with no one being able to do anything because there might be problems associated with it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole are of knowledge called &quot;risk management&quot; which is commonly used in cases of this type. If you think someone just sat down and created a slightly modified mosquito and didn&#39;t cover many, many possibilities then I think that just sounds unlikely.</p>

<p>Some good sources to back up your view, although I&#39;m not personally sold on this one. At least you did a lot more groundwork than virtually every other submission here, so keep on with that!</p>

<p>Incidentally, unrelated fact here - totally natural mosquitoes are responsible for more human deaths than any other cause throughout history. I&#39;m not sure we could improve on that on our first go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem with using risk analysis in bio-medical/genetic engineering is that any attempt to quantify the risk is a guess at best.  </p>

<p>They do risk analysis when building bridges, and it works very well.  This is because most of the risks are known.  Earthquakes, other weather events, tolerances on the structural materials, etc...</p>

<p>With bio-medical research, especially something like this where the product is released into the wild, there are literally millions upon millions of factors.  Further these various factors can compound upon each-other in un-predictable ways.</p>

<p>Due to these concerns, it&#39;s virtually impossible for us to say: &quot;If we release X into the ecosystem, there is a risk a of result x, risk b of result y, etc...  There are simply to many compounding factors. </p>

<p>In drug research, they don&#39;t really attempt to predict the risk factors.  They do in the early stages, but then human trials are performed.  We use the risk data from these trials in the risk analysis.  When a product is being released into a full-fledged eco-system, there&#39;s really no equivalent to controlled trials that can be performed.</p>

<p>You do realise that that there&#39;s no way of telling that this won&#39;t happen entirely without human intervention in virtually any life-form? Every virus that exists out there could suddenly turn into some unstoppable pandemic at any moment. I suspect there are subtle reasons why this hasn&#39;t happened to date.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t write off billions of years of evolution quite so quickly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s far more likely that &quot;If we release X into the ecosystem&quot;, it will be promptly eaten by something we didn&#39;t expect to do that.</p>
