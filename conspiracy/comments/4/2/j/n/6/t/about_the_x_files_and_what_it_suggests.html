What do you guys think?    </p>

<p>P.S. I loved the show back when it was on in the 90s and Early 00s. Added fuel to my beliefs that big brother isn&#39;t so nice. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people on <a href="/r/xfiles">/r/xfiles</a> are crapping on the premiere for its conspiracy talk, but that&#39;s what the whole show has always been about. I thought it was a good episode and it was interesting to see them talk about stuff like 9/11, FEMA camps, Project Bluebeam, chemtrails, etc. O&#39;Malley is definitely supposed to be like Alex Jones. They got pretty political about government surveillance and whistleblowers.</p>

<p>I very much doubt that you&#39;ve actually read his book where he says that the Bilderberg Group and Soviet Union meet at least once a year under polar ice caps in nuclear subs because it is impossible to bug and that he just happened to read about it in a classified file that was laying around.</p>

<p>Or that his theory on JFK was that the driver was the gunman.</p>

<p>His book is just filled with trash talk of other researchers and crazy things he read in classified documents that just happened to by laying around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They pretty much say as much in the first movie(I think it was the movie. I haven&#39;t watched the show or movie in a few years). Fox meets up with a conspiracy author who has info he needs. When Fox finds out the author is writing a new book about Fox&#39;s theories about the truth the author says &quot;why do you think they lead you to me. I need a new book and they know everyone will think of you as a loon if I write about you.&quot;</p>

Honestly, I interpreted as a warning and instilling the idea of society breaking down soon.

    <div class="md"><p>It actually was kind of interesting talking about the NSA, 9/11, Wikileaks in a hour long show.</p>

<p>And just another thought after watching the X-Files.  We typically take the NSA or FBI spying as a one-off surveillance without checks and balances.</p>

<p>But the X-Files premier had me thinking, why would they do this?  Maybe there is a conspiracy in the government pushing for these programs?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, about a month ago, an act called the CISA (Cyber Information Security Act or something like that) was smuggled at the back of a bill about NASA and space. It basically states that the govt can spy on you and compile data on you and do it completely unhindered. It can request that your Internet Service Provider give over your data, and they are required to as a result of this law. Hope that clears this up a bit :)</p>

My guess is that conspiracy theories are so main stream now that TPTB are working to control the direction they take and ensure further science fiction ridicule. Thus the topics the X-Files covers are officially sanctioned as acceptable and being directed. What the show refuses to dive into might be more interesting to note.</p>

If the conspiracies in the new one are more realistic then yeah that makes me wonder about the intentions of the show.</p>

<p>As far as the theory it&#39;s to encourage revolt. That has been a big theme in media in recent years. Just look at the movies aimed at the youth. Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze runner, etc. A lot of them involve some kind of revolution at some point.</p>

I already know the contents of what he was talking about but it was his &quot;it will start on a Friday&quot; that caught my attention because of an advertisement I saw several times during the Panthers-Cardinals game: the upcoming <em>Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> movie is due for opening on March 25th in the U.S., which is a Friday.  Why is that relevant?  Because I remembered the scene in the Will Smith movie, <em>I Am Legend</em> when it showed this:
<a href="http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/i-am-legend-batman-superman.jpg">http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/i-am-legend-batman-superman.jpg</a></p>

<p>Just as how the bad guys will leak shit to get into our minds so can the good guys. In either case they might not realise it&#39;s true but they&#39;ve open it as a possibility even if fake. </p>

They are winning, not because they are corrupt and abusing power, but because they are committed and they clearly see the end goal. God himself was threatened by this before, why was it evil?

    <div class="md"><p>I just cant wrap my head around why TPTB would want people thinking about the things they brought up in this show. I mean sure it could be wrapping truth in the ridicule of the fiction of a TV show, but if they&#39;re actually revealing at least some truth, it seems like they&#39;re shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to try to stay positive yet guarded and assume this is soft disclosure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Also, it was a way to get people to buy the whole season on amazon video streaming, with the temptation of a theme of government disclosure.  However, instead then they did a cheapshot bait and switch, going for &#39;cheap&#39; creature feature episodes culminating in episode 3, a lame attempt to parody Grimm and being somehow <em>worse and more cringeworthy</em>.  So now that amazon has my money, I am seriously considering asking for it back, telling them that pilot episode was so different from the other episodes that it might as well be a different show.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll report back if they allow it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched the episode its just too good. The intro monologue + opener alone gave my an orgasm.
Scully still hot and Mulder still burning for the Truth. Even Joel
Mchale as Alex Jones was good.</p>

<p>We need more than 6 Episodes. Sheeple need to see the Thruth. Even if they think its fiction it still works and provokes thought. Its the ultimate call for the search for Truth. Every last one of us has to become Mulder or Scully.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like someone who hates cats deciding to spend all their time in <a href="/r/cats">/r/cats</a> just to tell others they are wrong to like cats. It&#39;s not only obnoxious, it&#39;s pointless.</p>
