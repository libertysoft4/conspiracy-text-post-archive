<p>The Disappearing Witnesses was written in July of 2014. Since then, so many other players have disappeared that it&#39;s hard to keep track of them all. Here are a few that I think are noteworthy.</p>

<p>Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe has since decided to retire after 37 years on the force and 14 as Chief !! He has been under scrutiny for his response to the Sandy Hook shooting including the firing of Thomas Bean, who claimed to have been too traumatized by the shooting to return to work and is still collecting disability to this day!
Kehoe was also chastised for his leniency regarding his old friend Lt. George Sinko, who was reportedly on his post on an off-duty assignment doing traffic control at a construction site rather than responding to the largest school shooting in the history of CT ! The Chief punished him with a written reprimand which was severely criticized by the rest of the Dept. as being too soft.
Many have wondered how something such as “Operation Juicebox” could be conducted right under his nose as well. Operation Juicebox, you may recall, involved Newtown Police Officers Steven Santucci and Jason Chiklos, who were arrested and charged with the sale and distribution of steroids, opiates and cocaine !!
Kehoe will retire in January and is probably wishing it was here already ! God forbid he should have to perjure himself again by lying under oath in a FOIA Commission hearing!</p>

<p>Attorney General Eric Holder, notorious for his 1992 quote “We basically have to BRAINWASH people to view guns in a different way”, announced his resignation in September, 2014. His involvement with Sandy Hook became apparent as we learned that he had met with Gov. Malloy just two weeks before the event to discuss “Project Longevity” which was to allocate millions of dollars in Federal Funding to CT to promote gun control !!</p>

<p>Lt. J Paul Vance is another one of the main players that has left the scene. He was, of course, the mouthpiece of the CT State Police for over 19 years ! Why was he transferred to oversee the Traffic Division?
Most of us remember him as the main spokesmen who stated that “If it doesn&#39;t come from this office, it is considered misinformation.”</p>

<p>“One thing is becoming somewhat of a concern and that is ‘MISINFORMATION’ that’s being posted on social media sites. It is important to note that we (the royal we) have discussed with federal authorities that these issues are crimes. They will be investigated statewide and federally and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified.”
Many of us thought that he was repealing our first amendment right to ask questions, as more questions than answers were forthcoming in the hours and days after the story broke. “Official Sources” had proven themselves to be unreliable, at best, and conflicting more often than not !
J Paul Vance was a perfect example of that, as he stated that the body of Adam Lanza was found in the hallway, despite the fact that the CT State Police Report clearly stated that the body of Adam was found inside a classroom. Vance had been on scene all day long. Surely he should have known the location of the body.</p>

<p>Eric Langlois was the photographer who was responsible for capturing images of what appeared to be police officers participating in a drill outside of St. Rose of Lima school at about 3:00 PM on December 14, 2012. The officers appeared to have a man in custody, but minutes later he could be seen laughing and talking to them as if they were acquainted.
Eric went missing on June 11, 2013 after being dropped off at a lake by his wife to retrieve his bicycle which he had somehow crashed into the water the day before. Here is another strange “bicycle accident” story reminiscent of Douglas Cottle (Father of Alison Parker), who also died as a result of a biking accident.
The 33 year old&#39;s body was found more than a week later and the mystery still remains as to how and why he drowned.
Oddly enough, Eric&#39;s specialty in photography was the “morphing” of images- blending images to create a new one. Many of the researchers investigating Sandy Hook have speculated that at least some of the images used to depict the deceased children were perhaps created by altering images of their older siblings. Was Eric involved in the fabrication of these images ? Or was he eliminated because he saw too much at the St. Rose of Lima school ? We may never know.</p>

<p>There are many others who have been removed from the spotlight. Rick Thorne, the heroic janitor, who opened so many doors with his keys that day that the key “broke off in the lock”. He&#39;s never been photographed, interviewed or seen !
The elusive Kevin Anzelotti, the head custodian who was on vacation the week of Dec 14 has never been photographed, interviewed or see- despite being subpoenaed for a FOIA Hearing by Wolfgang Halbig.
Janet Robinson is another key player in the Sandy Hook story who moved on quickly after the incident. As Superintendent of Newtown Schools, she was responsible for cultivating a bizarre relationship with Asian schools and especially China, which she had visited several times and, in fact, had entertained Chinese Delegations on many occasions. Why were the Chinese in Newtown CT of all places, and why was Janet Robinson so soon to leave?
Ted Varga was the only male teacher at the Sandy Hook School on December 14, and was reported to have somehow gotten out through an emergency exit, but returned to help 4 other teachers escape through a window. His story of being at a meeting with the other 4th grade teachers when the shooting began (who was with the 4th graders?) is nearly as ridiculous as the claim that one of them escaped injury by hiding behind a “pile of donated Christmas gifts”! Despite being hailed as a hero, Ted Varga was never interviewed and left Newtown immediately after. In March of 2013, I recall seeing a FaceBook post from him showing that he was in Norway !! I wonder how he got there- if he ever existed at all.</p>

<p>With the suspected involvement of Domestic Homeland Security, it is no surprise that Janet Napolitano also stepped down as Secretary of Homeland Security less than a year after the Sandy Hook massacre. She moved on to become President of the University of California, home to another obvious shooting hoax called the Isla Vista Shooting.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Fox was supposedly the psychiatrist that treated Adam Lanza at the Yale Child Study Center who conveniently disappeared to New Zealand after losing his license for having sex with a patient. His name was concealed from the public for nearly a year and, by the time it was revealed, he was able to claim that the requirement for him to retain medical records had expired! In fact, it had only been 5 years since he had treated Adam, and the Law requires him to retain those records for SEVEN years !
Despite this fact, no attempts were ever made to retrieve those records, Dr. Paul Fox remains in New Zealand, and none of Adam Lanza&#39;s medical records have been made public.</p>

<p>State Police Commissioner Reuben F. Bradford left his post much earlier than expected just over a year after the incident. Bradford had served just 3 years as Commissioner after leaving a high paying job as Director of Security for the NFL to come to CT State Police. I wonder if his connections helped secure the singing performance of the Sandy Hook Choir at the Superbowl.</p>

<p>Michael Compare, a Milford CT Police Officer, who was so moved by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings that he volunteered to assist Newtown police in the aftermath, committed suicide on June 22, 2015. What was eating him up on the inside ? Like so many of the players who have left the picture, we may never know.</p>

<p>Jennifer Sredzinski is another notable character that has been murdered. On August 25, 2014, she was found beaten and dying in her Monroe, CT neighborhood. It took nearly 4 days for police to report her death as “suspicious”, leading neighbors to think that the cops had been concealing something.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Jennifer had been a 911 operator for nearly 20 years, there is no concrete evidence that would confirm that she was the “Jen” who Robert Nute told to “Hang up the phone” on Dec 12, 2012. In fact, it was Jennifer Barocsi who received an award for her role in the Sandy Hook incident, which would lead one to belive that she was the one working with Nute that day.
<a href="http://www.newtownbee.com/%E2%80%A6/dispatchers-nute-receive%E2%80%A6/129665">http://www.newtownbee.com/…/dispatchers-nute-receive…/129665</a></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Jason Chickos is also named as an award recipient in the aforementioned article. He was arrested along with 7 others for distribution of Cocaine, Oxycodone, and steroids in the Operation Juicebox investigation conducted by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
Chickos was convicted of distribution of steroids (only) and was sentenced to 2 years probation, 1200 hours of Community Service and $1,000 fine. He was facing 10 years and $500,000 in fines.
That seems pretty lenient when you think about Jon Reich and his 3rd degree misdemeanor resulting in a $50,000 bond and now a $100,000 warrant issued for his arrest !</p>

<p>The list goes on and on, and perhaps we will never know the whole story of who was involved in the Sandy Hook Hoax, but there sure was an exodus of players that were so heavily involved that have now been removed. - VIA FB SHH Group</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started at the very beginning to see if this claim carried any weight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is another strange “bicycle accident” story reminiscent of Douglas Cottle (Father of Alison Parker), who also died as a result of a biking accident. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to do a little bit of research to figure out the claim you&#39;re making here.  </p>

<p>Allison Parker is the reporter who was shot on air last year, whose father is an actor, and has since become an anti-gun lobbyist.</p>

<p>Allysa Parker is the daughter of the guy you are referring to here.  Her daughter is listed as a victim of the Sandy Hook shooting.</p>

<p>It took me so long to figure that out, that I really can&#39;t devote the time to fact checking the rest of this.  Deaths are easy to label as suspicious, and people die all the time.  I&#39;m pretty undecided on the SH conspiracy.  It&#39;s definitely something that COULD have happened, and school shootings are terrible tragedies- this would be up there as one of the most horrible mass shootings, next to the norwegian nationalist&#39;s attack on the youth camp.  But... as far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility, that something like this could be concocted as a propaganda drill.  I&#39;ve seen stranger things and some of the presented evidence is questionable</p>

<p>On the one hand, I know that these families have been put through the ringer.  If the story is TRUE (which is likely is), then their being barraged with skeptics is unfortunate and my heart goes out to them for their continued suffering.  On the other hand, they&#39;ve been made into PR reps (some of whom have taken up that mantle on their own accord), and as such are open to public scrutiny.  If there is a legitimate question about the validity of the story it SHOULD be scrutinized.</p>

<p>That said- this &quot;evidence&quot; is really hard to qualify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;That said- this &quot;evidence&quot; is really hard to qualify&quot;, 
I thought the same exact thing as you, until I read the first couple chapters of Jim Fetzer&#39;s &quot;Nobody Died At Sandy Hook&quot;. That book absolutely blew me away, and I was certain the Sandy Hook Massacre had happened as portrayed (one of the Supposed children that was killed is the daughter of someone who works in our company, and we were legit devastated.) After Reading Fetzer&#39;s piece, and asking around with coworkers, things began to make a twisted sort of sense.  But, even confronted with cold, hard, facts pointing to the truth, some people will absolutely never allow their minds to process that their government could do something so heinous and disgusting, although they have a history of doing just that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in conspiracies. The Dunblane Massacre in Scotland, which was pivotal in UK gun control, was very likely tied in with systematic pedophilia coverups that have recently roiled the public in the UK.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/frederick-forsyth/488066/Frederick-Forsyth-on-major-cover-ups-airport-ethnic-screening-and-the-French-media">http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/frederick-forsyth/488066/Frederick-Forsyth-on-major-cover-ups-airport-ethnic-screening-and-the-French-media</a></p>

<p>Hungerford, was probably legit.</p>

<p>If you have a personal tie in with Sandy Hook, I don&#39;t really want to question that.  I have personal experiences that I would never post online.  People wouldn&#39;t believe me because I&#39;m anonymous and a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.  I can&#39;t question your experience, because there&#39;s nothing particularly believeable or unbelievable about it.  </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ll read the book, though from what I&#39;ve seen, there isn&#39;t enough information to draw a conclusion.  The videos I&#39;ve seen are crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>theres a MSM photo of pizza being delivered to the firehouse dated 12/13/12. the EXIF data is absolutely clear.</p>

<p>the photoshopped OBESE bikerdude type firefighter types who were seen (photoshopped into the street scenes) do not and never were SH firefighters, theres an award/recognition group photo of the SH people, and they all are lean mean fit active firefighter types.</p>

<p>it takes time to clean out a firehouse and remove all the <strong>hoses and tanks and associated crap</strong> to the outside, yet the SH firehouse was emptied of gear (seen outside at 10:30am in aerial photos) and FEMA drill/exercise supplies and crisis actors are inside according to photos from that morning.</p>

<p>yet in less than 45 minutes the SH firehouse had been transformed for the event.</p>

<p>the prominent local Newtown Bee photographers all are missing from Twitter for that week (12/10/12 onwards) and a couple of weeks after, that suggests a drill and follow-up period.</p>

<p>CNN showed live on 12/14/12 the early morning raid by SWAT on Rose St. Lima. drone footage not helicopter</p>

<p>Gene Rosen, claimed in his many interviews to have sheltered kids for two hours or so, yet is seen in the aerial footage time stamped 10:30am or 10:40am at the firehouse. 45 minutes or so after the &#39;shooting&#39;, he lied to the MSM he lied for money and fame !!!, they need to recover their &#39;interview&#39; fees they paid him..</p>

<p>ditto the SHES footage, a drone not a news helicopter, other drones can briefly be seen in some footage flying under the &#39;News 12&#39; one. you cannot make this shit up, maybe some can...</p>

<p>TV shows the SWAT state troopers breaking open a shed door (afternoon shadows), yet the Newtown police were documented  as being the first ones on scene searching the back of the school and woods, they walked past an already broken open shed door. a logical impossibility without a time machine or a two day drill.</p>

<p>the Firehouse planter, the real one is made from square cross section railroad sleeper/ties, the studio set one is made from 2x8 planks of wood, the MSM filmed some of the grieving family footage in a studio before the drill/exercise.</p>

<p>SHES was an amazingly incompetent drill/exercise, only sold because MSM lies, and 90% of people don&#39;t care about the news or reality. either theres some serious chemicals in the water or people today are dumb as a box of rocks.</p>
