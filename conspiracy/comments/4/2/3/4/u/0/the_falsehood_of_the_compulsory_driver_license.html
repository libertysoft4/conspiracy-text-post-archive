<p>That&#39;s from Thompson v. Smith, a 1930 Virginia Supreme Court case: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3467100988685921366&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=6&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholarr">https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3467100988685921366&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=6&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholarr</a></p>

<p>Look right underneath the part you quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exercise of such a common right the city may, under its police power, regulate in the interest of the public safety and welfare; but it may not arbitrarily or unreasonably prohibit or restrict it, nor may it permit one to exercise it and refuse to permit another of like qualifications, under like conditions and circumstances, to exercise it.</p>

<p>The regulation of the exercise of the right to drive a private automobile on the streets of the city may be accomplished in part by the city by granting, refusing, and revoking, under rules of general application, permits to drive an automobile on its streets; but such permits may not be arbitrarily refused or revoked, or permitted to be held by some and refused to other of like qualifications, under like circumstances and conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, well since &quot;legal trifles&quot; were your entire post I figured that&#39;s what you wanted to focus on... I mean, if the legal arguments don&#39;t matter to you then why are you quoting them or linking to a page that&#39;s full of them?</p>

<p>As for unalienable rights... You have the right to travel freely on public land, just not in a car. There the states have said that you need a license. Driving a car on public land is not one of our most basic human rights. If you want to travel on public land without a license, get a bicycle or walk.</p>

<p>Like $ay putting an arbitrary date that&#39;s only significance is that it is on that same day years later, and revoke the license on the premise that it must be revoked because there is a special date stamped on it which means that you are not you anymore, not til you poney up some dough. </p>

<p>They used commas there, not periods. So that should be read like this:</p>

<p>That should not be read any other way than the way it was written. You&#39;re hearing what you want to hear. Don&#39;t tell me I have to omit words too in order for things to fit a world view that does not ever add up. Blatant semantic slide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you need to try to think for yourself rather than let someone else explain to you what government exists for. It&#39;s all a product of human imagination and completely arbitrary. Who the hell can tell anybody else what government exists for. It&#39;s not as if God came down one day and said &#39;hey, governments only exist to secure your freedom.&#39; No, somebody one day made an argument that the only reason government should exist is to secure our freedom. And he convinced a bunch of other people that his idea made sense. Not everyone agreed with him, and they still don&#39;t. So how can you come and tell me that&#39;s what government exists for. Who said so? Why did they say so? How could that even work? Do you know the difference between the meaning of freedom and the meaning of liberty? You should look into some of the classical thinkers on the subject of government, like Locke and Rousseau. Take an on-line course in political theory. Educate yourself in order to think for yourself about what government should be. And then realize that if that&#39;s how you think government should be, you are going to need to struggle to change government to look like that. You can&#39;t just go around telling people that &#39;government exists to secure our freedom&#39; like it&#39;s some kind of fact handed down from on high. You&#39;ve got to convince people that this is what government should be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You: &quot;Who the hell can tell anybody else what government exists for?&quot; </p>

<p>What the fuck else would government exist for other than to secure the people&#39;s rights and freedom? 
To take people&#39;s freedoms away? </p>

<p>In a perfect world, people could live peacefully on their own without a system of control to guide them. But people aren&#39;t perfect, and there are those who would pose a danger to others. And so government arises to secure people&#39;s safety and freedom. It&#39;s not complicated.</p>

<p>Only those who think for them self can govern them self. 
Think for yourself. Yes, please do. And everyone else too. That would be the dream world.
Except that&#39;s not what happens. The great majority of people don&#39;t want to think for them self. People want to be controlled and babied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree people don&#39;t want to think for themselves. But it&#39;s also important that when they do start thinking for themselves that they don&#39;t simply follow simplistic slogans. To think for yourself doesn&#39;t just mean embracing someone else&#39;s ideas (which yuou may have heard from someone else at a seminar or on a blog or facebook page). </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to think deeper than slogans like as &#39;government exists to secure our freedom.&#39; Well, as you pointed out in your reply to me, that statement is basically a truism -- what else would government exist for. But it&#39;s too simplistic. What does Freedom mean in the first place? And who gets to decide what it means? The slogan doesn&#39;t distinguish between &quot;freedom to&quot; and &quot;freedom from.&quot; Also, what happens when people&#39;s freedom&#39;s conflict with each other? If the government is there to secure my freedom to own weapons, what about people who say it exists to secure their freedom to live their life without fear of random gun violence? Does your freedom to own private property also mean that you have the freedom to pollute on said private property, even if the pollution seeps into the groundwater and poisons the water that I should have the freedom to safely drink? </p>

<p>TL;DR: Life is complicated, and real problems can&#39;t be solved with simplistic slogans. Thinking for yourself is hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your basic rights do not include driving irresponsibly and recklessly. As the roads are publicly shared with others it goes without saying that everyone drives safely and responsibly. 
Behaviour that brings harm to another, through negligence or intention, is held accountable for criminal activity. 
That is when government steps in: to bring justice for crimes already comitted.
Crimes need actual victims. 
It is not the government&#39;s job to nanny and baby us, with seat belt laws and vehicle driver licensure. 
Does passing a competency test prove the ability to drive safely? No it does not.
Who&#39;s better at driving? Someone who has driven for 30 years, but never had a license.  Or a 16 year old who just got their license?</p>

<p>Right, the roads are PUBLIC. That means they are for everyone, not just you.</p>

<p>And everyone (collectively) has decided, through their local and state governments, that it&#39;s better for all drivers to be licensed, all cars to be registered, and for all drivers to be insured.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like that, you&#39;re free to drive your car around on your own private property without those things.</p>

<p>Driving a car on public roads is not inalienable right.</p>
