        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The International Trade Commission will present its findings to congress in 2 days, with the ITC presenting the idea that the TPP will have a positive economic impact and thus recommends congress to vote yes on it: 
<a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-trade/2016/05/itc-report-wont-unstick-tpp-just-yet-214310">http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-trade/2016/05/itc-report-wont-unstick-tpp-just-yet-214310</a></p>

<p>This means in 2 days, congress will be able to vote pass the TPP for the first time. Now that it has gotten the rubber seal from the committee that oversees and gives expert recommendations on international economic issues. </p>

<p>Congress and the President could move it quickly like the PATRIOT Act, which passed in 4 days, spending one day each in committee, senate, house, and with the president. Very fast. Ready to go, just over a month after 9/11. Especially now that the election is becoming more and more locked down, if it&#39;s Hillary vs Trump that ensures a Hillary win and thus a win for the existing establishment. If they know they have Hillary in the pocket because of the design of our two-party system, they can start doing things that anger the public again without fear of losing their positions of power. </p>

<p>The <em>latest</em> this can be passed is 1 year 9 months from now. If it is delayed longer than that, for whatever reason, then the whole TPP is considered null and void and the whole thing goes back to the drawing board. Not only in the US, but in all 12 nations participating. This is only true in the US that it will void it for all the other countries, so it&#39;s extra-important to delay it at one or many of the 4 stages of US passage in to law if possible. Obama isn&#39;t going to veto the TPP, and Hillary likely won&#39;t either. So it&#39;s got to be at the congress level this has to be delayed or stopped. If anyone has any good ideas, let&#39;s hear them now, because the window for TPP passage is opening in 2 days. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Really all you can do is contact your representatives, and to tell as many people as possible to do the same. In the end, though, if tptb want it then it will pass, no matter how much the US citizens say they don&#39;t want it. The PATRIOT act, NDAA, CISA, etc. all received as much negative attention as TPP, and nothing stopped them. Congress is already bought and paid for. So whatever tptb actually want, they&#39;ll get Congress to sign it into law.</p>

<p>Unfortunately nothing short of mass revolt will actually stop these things from occurring. A vast majority of people are too comfortable with how their lives are to attempt such a thing.</p>

<p>This is obviously a very cynical thought, but I still have hope. More and more people are waking up everyday, and technology is almost outpacing government. There have been significant advances in self-sufficient tech (hydroponics, 3d printers, cryptocurrencies, etc.) So hopefully there will be a massive shift of consciousness in 30-40 years that will end up undoing what the leviathan has created. I just don&#39;t see it happening in the &quot;near&quot; future. Hopefully tptb don&#39;t round us up for the culling before then... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are ways of making it happen that are nonviolent, we just need to study revolutions like the velvet revolution or the &quot;pots and pans&quot; revolution of Iceland. People need better techniques to get the precise changes they want, because if things go the violence route... well the US government&#39;s military and police system is one of the biggest and best in the world, I&#39;ll just put it that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, for sure, I always prefer non-violent approaches. It&#39;s just that for these types of revolts to occur requires a scale of cooperation that is virtually impossible to achieve with the level of spying that occurs today. You would have to convince everyone that you plan with to not have their mobiles on their person during &quot;meetings&quot;, and to not share <em>anything</em> over the internet regarding your plans. If any info were to leak to the spies, your &quot;group&quot; would be infiltrated the moment that it became large enough to actually matter.</p>

<p>Do you think you could convince people outside of your group that there are nefarious actors infiltrating your secret group? Most people get their info from MSM which would shit on you hardcore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no way to maintain secrecy for any sizable group, it would just have to be all out in the open perhaps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you try to organize any kind of revolt in the open, even if it is non-violent, again the MSM will shit on you. Sure, you&#39;ll get media attention, but every time people hear about someone revolting against government most of them figure they&#39;re just crazies. The Waco siege was a good example of this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say that revolution is impossible, or that you&#39;re stupid for thinking we can achieve one. It&#39;s just that people in &quot;developed&quot; countries are very pacified due to how convenient life has become. People fear that if they revolt against their governments, even if it is non-violent, that everything will return to the stone age. They fear they will lose their McDonald&#39;s, gas stations, movie theaters, etc. That fear keeps them happy with shrugging things like the TPP off, because it&#39;s &quot;just another law&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s why I said to let everyone you know to call their representatives. If they ask you why then you can explain why the TPP is bad, and maybe push in other topics you find important. It&#39;s really easy to discuss this stuff on the internet, but having face-to-face conversations with your friends/family is far more helpful. Sure, it&#39;s not easy, especially if they have different political opinions. However, the more you share this with them face-to-face the more they will look into it on their own, because they&#39;ll see that it is actually important to you who is their friend or family member.</p>
