<p>Coincidence, I recently posted what seems to be a rather prescient concept on this same theme (copy and use search): r/C_S_T/ comments/ 4iyd7j/ premise_the_usa_would_be_grand_if_it_was_smaller/</p>

<p>edit: It makes me wonder what kind of lame brains run this country. I read much in financial news, and there is plenty speech regarding national deficit (something like 16 trillion). If the Fed owes this debt, dump the Fed. If the US Treasury owes the debt, we have two easy outs. Cancel the US corporation (the government is literally a business, not a country). Either leave it gone, or revert back to the organic constitution. Either way, the entity that owes the debt is gone, so the debts are void, same as when a person dies. Without some binding contract to pass the debt, it disappears. Duuhh.</p>

<p>Revision of title: news will not be televised by the current establishment. However, if the establishment is re-organized, it might be.</p>

<p>consider all these releases to be <em>cum grano salis</em></p>

I am trying to find the ties that this is a sign that the writing for Clinton is on the wall. I could see how the Clinton Foundation, her being POTUS and EagleVale (son in law&#39;s hedge fund) would work in tandem to use American $$ to bail out Greece in turn making Chelsea and her husband billionaires. I think they are all closing up shop because they know the FBI is going to drop the hammer. Also, the guy lost roughly 360 Million, which seems more like he Ponzi&#39;d everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so skeptical of any news that&#39;s as good as this, maybe I&#39;m jaded by the hordes of disinformation we get doused with. I&#39;ve always been a proponent of the idea that there are enough good people in the world to prevent the new world order from unleashing their mayhem fantasies on the public, and if this is all true, then maybe there was some merit to it after all. But I&#39;ll keep up on this. The currency system is obviously broken beyond repair at this point, and without a reset, truly reclaiming our government can&#39;t truly happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In trying to find more information on this, it looks more and more like disinfo, maybe even complete trolling. News of this coup was brought up back in early March, whereas the more recent reports say it happened a couple of weeks ago and was the real reason the White House was put on lockdown.</p>

<p>Likely just more attempts at pacification, or, an act of desperation on behalf of those who know the truth is picking up steam. That, or just some fanfic someone came up with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are probably right, these rumors are off the mark. Good chance the CIA is behind it, but there are too many sources that seem legit to think it is complete nonsense. What I do, is think about the plausibility. Fact: Trump and Sanders are no-go choices for the CIA/NWO. HRC is an albatross around their collective neck. Scenario: Set up Paul Ryan as temporary pres. and GOP nominee for 2016. Problem solved? Very plausible. Ergo, Trump has a choice to make. I have a nifty idea what could be one option, but no time for that here, will be posting the idea on r/c_s_t soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think it&#39;s very possible that the global financial system is on the cusp of being transformed, though. The system can&#39;t last forever, and it would be of no surprise to me if nations were already working on a gold-backed currency that replaces the debt-based model. How this will affect America&#39;s economy, I&#39;m not quite sure, but it won&#39;t be positive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Demise of the Fed has been in the financial news for years. If you listen to the videos, they are saying the Eccles bldg, in DC and the NY Fed are shut, no lights, no one going in/out. We will know before long if something spooky really happened. The Fed is one of the main features of interest (ha ha) in the financial world.</p>

<p>Did you know there is a new type of &quot;gold backed currency&quot; which takes that name seriously? It is a dollar-sized sheet of polymer with a small amount of gold deposited as a film on the back. The polymer is clear, with black ink on front. The brilliant gold color makes these notes truly beautiful. Probably not to be in the USA future as official money. We are going to a cashless society. But the Au notes may be available here as collector&#39;s items.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi again, u/slim_. There are several documentaries on this, not sure now if all are listed above. Will check them next opportunity. While all of these sources are tainted with idiotic crap, I have been looking at the story for about 2 years. I believe it is true, more or less. It just makes more sense to me than anything else. I guess we will know for sure come July 4. The crap may be intentional. It&#39;s a cloaking tactic I call &quot;code blogging&quot;. The idea is posted in r/c_s_t, my new fav sub. I have other posts there, scroll thru the last few days using the &quot;new&quot; tab.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s all true, we (north) Americans are going to be owing a debt of thanks to the USMC, <em>Semper Fidelis.</em> And, I suspect Karen Hudes had much to do with it (in her role as whistle-blower for the World Bank).</p>

<p>PS. u/slim_, did I ever advise you to read 2.Perspective.pdf ? Anyone who likes to know about conspiracies would be thrilled. (book is free to download)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t seen the PDF, go ahead and link me.</p>

<p>At this point...I have to think <em>something</em> is happening. If high-ranking officials in our military have figured this all out and gotten together to do something about it, then I&#39;m genuinely shocked. There would have to be a lot more done than simply storming the white house, but again, this is pretty far beyond my grasp.</p>

<p>If nothing happens come July 4th, as I suspect will be the case, then we can probably brush this off. But even so, there&#39;s undoubtedly and economic transformation that will go down before very long. It&#39;s just a question of how bad the American people will be affected. Since there&#39;s a growing amount of info on all this, I&#39;ll keep up, and hope (pray?) for the best.</p>

<p>As far as code blogging...it makes sense. From what I gathered, it&#39;s a technique of intentionally making absurd claims while still putting informative material in it. All it takes is one or two mentions of reptilians and aliens before people treat is as disinfo, so if there was some double-trickery going on, it would be quite clever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey there, u/slim_; Answering in reverse order: discrediting the witness is about as old as trials. All it takes is one or two slip ups and the LIE alarms go off gong gong gong. So like you say, protect your ass by delivering some obvious lies, and slip in the dangerous truth. Plead insanity.</p>

<p>The financial collapse scenario has been a staple of financial newsletters for years. Of course, they are right, given the given. But as I will soon be posting, Black Swan events don&#39;t have to be bad. If this one comes in for a landing 7/4, Hallelujah; ain&#39;t we got fun!</p>

<p>In one of the videos, it said this counter-attack against the &quot;Khazarian Mafia&quot; has been in prep since 1979. 38 years. And the list of minions may be around 2 million. I&#39;m thinking that is probably a gross exaggeration, but I would believe a few hundred thousand. I&#39;m no bleeding heart, so it would be ok with me if they are all tried in military courts, where the penalty for treason is to face a firing squad. Next question, do they have enough bullets? Look back in the news for the billions of rounds purchased recently by various gov&#39;t agencies. They have plenty of ammo. (wink)</p>

<p>The high ranking military; they had to wait to get a Marine in the Joint Chiefs office (Semper Fi). Martin Dempsey was a Knight of Malta (Jesuit). They had to wait to get hold of gold, because USA the Republic has no money of its own, which they must have according to international law. The Pope came to sign off on recognition of the new Republic, hidden in W Virginia. Other news suggest the Pope must be replaced (Jesuit).</p>

<p>One thing has me a little worried is that the amount of gold that will be on the world market may devalue existing holdings of gold. I guess that is small potatoes compared to being rid of the K Mafia.</p>

<p>The independent and indie reporters will be having a field day, no competition from the mainstream. The MSM is part of the scam, and its brass will be under indictment along with Congress and the Supreme Court, and probably a bunch of lobbyists and industrial contractors. What a mess!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the pdf. Now I can&#39;t find it. The title is A GRANDFATHER’S ENCOURAGEMENT
To Our Next Generation, but all I find is the summary which is 45 pages. The original is 1103 pages, profusely illustrated. Didn&#39;t I tell you about this one before, and you were reading it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating stuff. I&#39;m just a little confused that we&#39;ve gone 2 months since this &quot;coup&quot; and very little that we see has really changed. Obama is still around and doesn&#39;t appear any different than before. Then again, this could have something to do with his extreme apathy towards his job at this point.</p>

<p>The only change I guess I can think of is that I haven&#39;t seen any planes spraying chemtrails over the past few weeks...lol. But to think that the ammo they bought will be used to OUR benefit is still a stretch, and would serve as a wonderful pacification disinfo tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi again, u/slim. I just came back here to correct a calculation error in the years. </p>

<p>Ah, not only the ammo to use in firing squads, but the FEMA camps to hold them, and maybe some of them to go to the gas chambers they had prepared in Beechgrove IN. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IulDDQ-yXk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IulDDQ-yXk</a>   <a href="http://americanholocaustcoming.blogspot.com/2009/02/confirmed-amtrak-deathcamp-of-beech.html">http://americanholocaustcoming.blogspot.com/2009/02/confirmed-amtrak-deathcamp-of-beech.html</a></p>

<p>If there is something missing from the next FOMC meeting in mid-June, that would be a big &quot;tell&quot; the Fed is caput. <a href="http://www.profitf.com/calendars/fomc-meeting-schedule/">http://www.profitf.com/calendars/fomc-meeting-schedule/</a></p>

<p>The videos I&#39;ve seen so far focus on USA, but say there is a dragnet in Europe too. This project must be a monster to prepare, and be certain no failure, because the Khazars have no mercy. They are said to do ritual sacrifice of human infants, and evidence has been collected to indict. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I definitely believe the human sacrifices. There&#39;s far too many people out there talking about it as if it were legit. Judging by the ceremonies we&#39;ve seen on video they&#39;re participating in, I have little doubt there&#39;s worse in more private settings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just such a wild twist to have the FEMA camps and DHS ammo buy-ups actually be intended for capturing the elites, rather than protecting their interests by going after the normal citizen. I was never a big believer in the FEMA camp predictions of horror and mass arrest, so this would actually make a little more sense to me.</p>

<p>Anyway...regardless of what&#39;s true, we&#39;re in for an entertaining few decades ahead of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/Slim, did you see the video of Ben Fulford? He makes a bunch of pie in the sky promises, including immortality! Funny thing is, I follow advancements in technology, and barring some catastrophe, the tech people are on the cusp of outrageous advancements. (They call it the &quot;hockey stick&quot; for a graph that goes from near horizontal then up exponentially.) For instance immortality, they now have chemicals that can lengthen a person&#39;s chromosome telomeres, a key to longevity, and 3-d printing is supposed to be able to print spare organs for transplant, using the person&#39;s own stem cells, so no immune rejection. Stuff like that. Get into it more by visiting my own personal sub r/evolutiontechnology. But please do find time to listen to the Ben.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical of Ben, mainly because he&#39;s given all these dates on which things should be happening in the past, with absolutely no fruition of any of them.</p>

<p>BUT as all my previous messages...I can acknowledge the truth of what you&#39;re saying, that immortality is probably well within grasp at this point. I just have a difficult time putting myself behind anything these days with all the varying disinfo.</p>

<p>I thought a bit more about the code blogging concept, and you know, there&#39;s got to be something to it. The whole &quot;light alliance&quot; and &quot;reptilian alien&quot; comments just seem so out of place within the context of their discussions, it&#39;s as if it really IS intentionally interjected as a diversionary tactic. It just makes no sense. But that being the case, some interviewees have gone on record saying the coup d&#39;etat is more or less a fantasy and things still need to be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious if anyone did the search. Because i did, and the article claims that John Dunford with the help of aliens disposed the cabal, had obama step down and is acting as interim president... While that would be awesome it seems like something out of a movie. </p>

<p>Can you post more info on this? I mean it kind of adds up. John is/was the joint chief and a general for the marines (every marine I&#39;ve ever met has had honor). Just, why now and not 50 years ago?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for looking into this, u/snipthetipthensip; first off, it&#39;s Joseph, not John. There are several youtube vids on dunford. Simply do a search on there for him. I&#39;m still looking into the story, but dealing with a time-squeeze. I&#39;ve got your username, and will send you a message with what I turn up, next few days. This is a big story.</p>

<p>Biggest rumor so far, Paul Ryan is already acting president, Dunford as VP. O&#39;Bummer and Biden split, as in exited separate ways. Question is, will Trump bow out to leave Ryan the nominee, or will he do something else? I have an idea, will be posting in r/c_s_t soon. Got to go back to work now.</p>
