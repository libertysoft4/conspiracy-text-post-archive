        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this is the right place, but I don&#39;t have all the evidence yet, though I have more than SRS and the reddit Admins would be comfortable with, because hey SJW&#39;s aren&#39;t the only people who know how to infiltrate.</p>

<p>As you may know, for some time SRS has been brigading and doxxing people very publicly, against the reddit content policy. When the admins are questioned both privately and publicly (<a href="/r/announcements">/r/announcements</a> &amp; <a href="/r/modsupport">/r/modsupport</a>) they either say there are no issues with doxxing or they&#39;re not aware of any doxxing from SRS... Despite it being on the sub.</p>

<p><a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> exploded with activity and as a result the mods began modding people who could help, but accounts weren&#39;t effectively screened so they managed to get infiltrated. Once in the doxxing and bans started, <a href="/u/CISwhiteMaelstrom">/u/CISwhiteMaelstrom</a> was first, and SRS publicly took credit for it... I mean come on, they&#39;re actually admiting to doing it. Mods they couldn&#39;t dox have been suspended or removed and now <a href="/u/lil-z">/u/lil-z</a> is in charge, the moderators have been purged.</p>

<p>What happened during this, oh <a href="/r/european">/r/european</a> was banned by the admins... We were very strict on who became mod of european and there was no way it could be infiltrated, I was doxxed and threatened, however I&#39;m a very &quot;Bring it on&quot; type of guy, I&#39;m certainly not scared of a couple of weedy anarchists breaking into my house, it&#39;s one way for them to end up either getting shot or their arses kicked. My employer (who has been called) laughed in their faces on the phone. Unable to to dox or infiltrate european depite trying, it was quarantined and effectively let to die. The admins have been silent on it, won&#39;t answer what we breached in the content policy (Because we didn&#39;t). SRS are now proclaiming victory in modmail and thanking admins for their help.</p>

<p>A little worrying that admins are getting involved in something so petty, but how long is this going to go on for? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to pose another idea. </p>

<p>Admin is SRS. Now may sound stupid, but let&#39;s look at what happened with Voat. When the whole iama thing happened and Victoria deal happened.</p>

<p>Reddit shift happened. Akto was going on about the massive influx of traffic quite a bit. Also when fatpeoplehate and coontown shifted to Voat it seemed more and more was being talked about how shitty Reddit was getting. </p>

<p>Shortly there after someone from SRS claimed that they got PayPal donations to retract the service. Also froze the account. It was said because of the pedofile association. Thing was that as soon as akto was informed he deleted it. </p>

<p>He wouldn&#39;t comment, but I am pretty sure that it was an account that only posted that and was soon deleted as some speculation was going. Reddit admin has a history of siding with SRS cause drama brings users.</p>

<p>Everytime drama comes along they are behind it in some way or another. Its what makes users come into the fray. Content adds revenue.</p>

<p>Plus all the threats. Ugh had one users threaten to torture my son and murder him. The name was tied to SRS going 3 years back with threats and somehow I was the first one that reported it? Well admin took 3 days to respond and was snarky about it.</p>

<p>They banned the user it was unsettling cause they also found my Facebook account. SRD users were even advocating the user like it was funny. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t so I did my own thing and found them. Reported it to a local PD and they said they would handle it. Since then I have been banned from all the SRS controlled pages. I got a notification of being banned from 23 different sub&#39;s at once. </p>

<p>The thing is that Reddit is about making money and they do that thru conflict. You don&#39;t tow the line you get banned. Always remember that if they fuck with you don&#39;t target that person find someone else in the ranks and target them.</p>

<p>You only need to find one. The rest will fall in line. Its college kids doing this. They cower once you find their identity cause its what gives them the power to do this. Strip it from them and get authorities involved when they break the law.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t post the info online cause it won&#39;t do anything. You will be the only one to act on it. So report it to the law and make shit stick. </p>

<p>These people are all affiliated with one another outside of Reddit in other social media. Chances are the use goggle chat to speak with each other. So they will have profiles. </p>

<p>EDIT.</p>

<p>I want everyone that reads this to notice something. Each comment I have made in here within the last two days is down voted within one minute. This is most of the most people can do. It shows you what&#39;s the most important to these people.</p>

<p>Acceptance. Now you think about that. Its a weakness they have. Something you can expolite to your advantage. </p>

<p>How many here care about the acceptance of others you couldn&#39;t even borrow a cup of sugar from? I don&#39;t cause I dont know any of you on a personal level.</p>

<p>Now I do know many on a personal level. Been to their homes. Had dinner with them. They do matter to me. Now these people going thru Reddit to discredit you they care about acceptance of a complete stranger.</p>

<p>Think about how you can use that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand these peoples mentalities. I will explain it to you.</p>

<p>They feed off of victimization. Meaning that you will validate the bad guy mentality of you to them if they find out you targeted one. Its pointless really to go after them I have found cause when you take one down three more join the fray.</p>

<p>So many youth today are angry cause of whatever reason. They use that anger for shit they think can cause the most harm. Sure you as an adult will feel better for retaliation to someone cause fuck them right?</p>

<p>I ruined this kids life possibly. If they got a felony then that is fucking it! They could get kids out of school. If they were going into education then that&#39;s done. </p>

<p>I mean damn it really sucks to think about it that I could have caused this just cause they typed some words. Knowing full well they wouldn&#39;t act on it, but just to prove a point I went as far as I could. </p>

<p>Who is the worse one really? Me for retaliation or them for provocation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering when the reddit meta discussion would return. Reddit is a liberal machine, if all the young adults were conservative in some bizzaro world episode of our lives; then the narrative would still be heavily controlled possibly even more so. There are not a lot of people out there who don&#39;t know reddit is compromised, or they could care less because something they are patiknate about doesn&#39;t get censored. </p>

<p>I mean ask yourself; over the last year and a half how many times has censorship happened to a point that brought a lot of traffic here due to shenanigans else where? Yet people so ill love using it simply because it is easy, intuitive, and already has a lot of content established. Digg 2.0, yet they&#39;ve gotten better at keeping people around.</p>

<p>It seems to me there will always be a minority to silence something. I&#39;m just waiting for the day for something really big to go down Ellen Poa on crack. However based on how much crap reddit and her admins have pushed on their people, and people still participate (even myself) it doesn&#39;t leave much for the imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This shit will never end. Reddit will never &quot;go back to the way it was.&quot; Impossible. If anything, the effects of media and censorship will consolidate Reddit into the large liberal mainstream subreddits where they can control certain topics, everything else will be silenced and only circle jerk echo chamber subreddits will exist, usually rather empty.</p>

<p>Something will ultimately replace reddit. But it won&#39;t be another &quot;site.&quot; Something else will need to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to simply laugh at the notion and dismissing it sort of shows your bias towards a specific ideology. Do we so soon forget the years of Bush Jr. and putting the shoe on the other foot; how compromised fox news was during his tenure? Sure TRUE conservatism would dictate not having mass media control over information as it supposedly seeks less and less over reaching government. Do the people in power who call themselves conservative really opperate that way? No.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d also like to point out the &quot;conservative&quot; English majority and the prime minister giving the ability to cable providers to opt in for porn access. Israel&#39;s &quot;conservative&quot; government manipulating pretty much every media outlet in the world, and Brazil&#39;s new conservative government that attempted to block whatapp (that 10million brazilians use) for 72 hours, but was only locked for 24.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mods cannot delete comments, only &quot;remove&quot; them. This means that the comment will still be visible to the submitter but not other users.</p>

<p>Reddit admins (ie employees) are tough on subreddits which are seen to be encouraging brigading or attacks on other subreddits. This sub has been accused of brigading in the past. The mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are therefore going to remove any posts (like yours) because not doing so could be damaging to the sub.</p>
