    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand the FEMA camp thing. Much like I can&#39;t understand how if SHTF and everyone suddenly couldn&#39;t pay their mortgage that the banks would just take our zillion homes instead of leaving us in them paying what we could. How do they recoup their money if no one has any?
Why put us all in FEMA camps? Wouldn&#39;t it be easier just to take us out and pop a 25 cent bullet in our heads? I mean... if they just want to thin the herd... couldn&#39;t they just announce a &quot;flu&quot; or epidemic of some type and claim that all the non-sheep that were quarantined just succumbed to the fake epidemic or something?
It just seems like a lot of work and cost involved with retraining and feeding us as prisoners. There seems to be a thought process that I&#39;m missing.
TL;DR  why bother with FEMA camps. Why not just bump us off?</p>

<p>What they dont mention in the article is the supposed suicide note left. </p>

<p>Ill just quote the most pertinent info for your question from the supposed note.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the American people knew what this government is planning, they would rise-up and overthrow it. If I or anyone else in the federal government revealed what is coming, we would be killed anyway, so now I will reveal what I know.</p>

<p>We in federal law enforcement have been drilling for several years to control riots and uprisings from a coming financial collapse and widespread bank failures. The drills involve life-sized images of American men, even women and children, whom we are told to shoot for &quot;practice&quot; and to &quot;get used to it.&quot;</p>

<p>We have been told that the economy is terminally ill and will fail in 2016. We are also told the banks are all insolvent and the FDIC doesn&#39;t have nearly enough funds to bail out depositors.  We are told these events are unavoidable and it is imperative that the government survive when people rise-up over this.</p>

<p>When the collapse takes place,  detention camps created under the FEMA REX-84 program in the 1980&#39;s to house illegal aliens whom we were going to deport, will instead be used to imprison American Citizens whom the government feels constitute a &quot;threat.&quot;  American citizens will be rounded-up without warrants and imprisoned without trial for God knows how long.</p>

<p>These camps have been equipped to carry out Hitler-scale killings! An actual &quot;purge&quot; of Americans citizens by the very government which they, themselves, created and pay for!  I cannot be party to this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;When the inevitable collapse begins to take place, electric power to the entire country will be shut off, as will all forms of communication. All banks will be immediately closed; no one will be able to get any money because all ATM&#39;s will be offline. Credit, Debit and EBT cards will not function.  Anyone without cash will have no way to get any.  The Emergency Alert System will be used to takeover all broadcast stations and tell the public this is a result of a cyber attack.  </p>

<p>But while the American people patiently await things to get back to normal, the government will unleash round-ups of citizens they deem militants or dangerous.  With all civilian communications out, and all TV and radio stations taken over by the Emergency Alert System, by the time word spreads of what is taking place, the government will already have the upper hand.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should really read the entire note on your own, I have no idea if it is legit or not, but it strikes some key points that I have been following for well over a decade. This guy wasnt told the entire story, but enough so they can &quot;train&quot; for what is going to happen. I also dont think a economic collapse will be the trigger, but a world cataclysmic event is most likely going to be the trigger. One thing is for sure, police dont think twice about blowing away a civilian anymore, so you should take what this guy says seriously. </p>

<p>TL:DR
Its easier for the government to use the camps to round up &quot;preppers&quot; and local militiamen (things like that) and take them all out at once before they realize who their real enemy is.</p>

<p>Divide and conquer, pretty simple really. </p>

<p>Is this what is really going to happen? who really knows :/</p>

<p>I have heard that some of them are being converted into warehouses and that they have an alarming amount of security although I haven&#39;t seen any of this myself.</p>

<p>Even if there is no deeper conspiracy here regarding Wal-mart, the fact that this many discount stores are closing is a very bad sign for the state of our economy.</p>

<p>Edit:  Not to mention these &quot;Walmart express&quot; locations put countless local retailers and groceries out of business and now they are gone.  It will be tough for certain areas to recover especially in rural AL and GA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember.  And those locations were closely guarded 24-7 by militarized police.  </p>

<p>It could be that those initial 5-6 were the pilot program and now they are rolling out the next phase.  As the economy weakens, Walmart should strengthen as more consumers look for discounted goods, but these stores are closing...  I don&#39;t claim to know what&#39;s going on but there is more to it than meets the eye.</p>

<p>I happen to do commercial real estate research and analysis, and I can tell you that Dollar General&#39;s are popping up everywhere like crazy which makes sense, and the same should be happening to Walmart but it seems that the opposite is true.  When you consider that Walmart is large enough to have been included in the initial TPP discussions it makes it even more suspicious IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a interesting youtube video, and i cant seem to find it off the top of my head. </p>

<p>If you google &quot;closed walmarts overlayed on old underground tunnels&quot; you should find some information.</p>

<p>But the theory is that back in the 60&#39;s or 70&#39;s a tunnel system was dug out underneath the united states. And for the last decade they have started expanding and enlarging their network. Supposedly these closed walmarts are sitting nearly right on top of these supposed old tunnel systems. If you beleive what these people are saying, then they plan on using the walmarts as deployment points to quickly and quietly move troops and weapons with out anyone seeing them. </p>

<p>Found the video I seen that had the original map. The guy who created this video brings up many valid points. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k5QM7g3GIA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k5QM7g3GIA</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone live near one of the renovated ones? Several of the ones that remained open underwent major renovation and had tons of beige cargo containers outside them, along with some suspicious people milling about.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of advocating the FEMA camp nonsense, because seriously, life just seems too short. But I recall a post on some conspiracy forum by a person, claiming to be an expert, about how someone noticed these renovated / closed Walmarts are almost always near train tracks (presumably for easy FEMA processing). But I just realized that my local Walmart is under renovation, is with 3 miles of two sets of train tracks going different directions (N/S and E/W) and a soon-to-open FEMA office. They are going in to an old, gross building that belonged to a for-profit chain of colleges. Anyone have any insight on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what is happening at their locations, the fact that 269 Walmarts are closing worldwide is a bad indicator.  These walmarts put a lot of people out of business that couldn&#39;t compete with their prices and they can&#39;t just re-emerge overnight.  This will effect a lot of people whether you take it seriously or not.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind that Walmart is one of the companies that has had access to the TPP text.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet, it IS business as usual. Do you realize they have over 11,000 stores worldwide? They are closing 2.3% of them, and most of those locations have already been replaced with &quot;supercenters&quot; that are nearby or at least in the same market. They are closing mostly the small &quot;older&quot; stores, and the Neighborhood Markets. </p>

<p>The company is getting older. Many times, it&#39;s faster/cheaper to build a NEW store and close the old one (sometimes, they open one next door or across the street!).  Closing and replacing 2.3% of stores of a company that has stores/buildings that have been around since the late 1960&#39;s (or the late 1980s for most of their stores) isn&#39;t a big deal.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s also not forget that their sales have increased by +-$10 BILLION, EVERY YEAR for the last decade or more. And have <em>averaged</em> $17.4 BILLION increases every year for the last decade. <a href="http://www.statista.com/graphic/1/183399/walmarts-net-sales-worldwide-since-2006.jpg">Graph</a></p>

<p>This is about cutting costs and &quot;streamlining&quot;, so they can be more profitable. It&#39;s not about closing stores to somehow create some super-secret warehouse of some sort. It&#39;s also NOT any indicator AT ALL of any negative economic indicator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I agree and disagree with you.  This is not an indicator of economic weakness for Walmart.  Walmart is enormous and their stores are virtually always profitable.  I am familiar with the way Walmart strategically opens and closes stores and although it sounds sensational that 269 Walmarts are closing I agree that this will be but a drop in the bucket <em>for Walmart.</em></p>

<p>That being said, Walmart cannibalizes local retailers and grocers by undercutting their prices.  They only buy from vendors that can produce enough to stock each and every shelf of each and every store which allows them to regulate consumer pricing by getting wholesale prices themselves.  </p>

<p>But as you pointed out, many of these Walmarts that closed ARE profitable.  They may not be leaders in revenue but the vast majority of these closed locations made money.  A lot of them had only been at their location for a year and in some cases less.</p>

<p>Once a Walmart has been in a rural area for a couple of years, that area becomes dependent on them.  This will have significant economic impact for many rural families not to mention the employees themselves.  </p>

<p>Perhaps this is business as usual for Walmart, but at the very least, this is yet another example of a global corporation lining their pockets at the expense of the consumer (aka we the people.)  </p>

<p>On top of all of this, in some cases these sites that used to be Walmart are becoming sites for suspicious police and military personnel/equipment.  We the people don&#39;t truly know what&#39;s going on in the TPP but Walmart does, and this is a blaring example of just how little of a fuck they give about we the people.</p>

<p>I realize that Barack Obama would contend that I am &quot;peddling fiction,&quot; but Sports Authority just went bankrupt and closed all stores, Home ownership is going into the shitter, and Dollar Generals are seeing unfathomable profits.  Not to mention Walmart just laid off thousands of unskilled employees.  </p>

<p>The economy is declining regardless of whether you choose to accept it.  Although I agree with you that Walmart is not going to take the hit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s 269.  154 in the US.  </p>

<p>You are right in a way, Walmart themselves will likely not be affected significantly by this, but as I have said elsewhere the rural communities where these Walmarts are closing will be devastated, and it is unclear why such a massive company that is resistant to downturns in the economy would close so many stores, especially not all at once.  This is a bad sign for the consumer, but more importantly to the investors who may divest if they believe Walmart is on the decline.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a great point, but then why would a company decide to close a store that is profitable?  It goes directly against the capitalistic model.  There must be something more to gain from this beyond the profit that these locations were generating.  That is what I find odd.  That coupled with the rumors of police activity at the closed locations. </p>

<p>All that aside, we can agree that this is probably not a big deal <em>for Walmart</em> and for the record I am envious that you can play a game with your girl without her biting your head off.</p>
