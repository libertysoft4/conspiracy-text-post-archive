<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4g7jay/updated_compilation_of_confirmed_conspiracy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4g7jay/updated_compilation_of_confirmed_conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>This post here was very popular, for good reasons that are probably different for everyone.  So at some point in the future we will be adding it to the sidebar in one format or another.</p>

<p><strong>Looks like the best way to do it is going to be as a wiki page, so that it can be updated/maintained by multiple contributors instead of just one user.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;d need to add a lot more confirmed stuff onto it, otherwise it&#39;s more of a limited hangout.  In my opinion it&#39;s OK to have such a fixture in the sidebar, but it would need to be expanded and not under the control of one user, otherwise it leaves the sub vulnerable, I would prefer to see the mods put together a more comprehensive list, under mod control.</p>

<p>Also most of the links go to Wikipedia, that means outsiders can come in and &#39;cleanup&#39; the information whenever they wish, really we could do with each &#39;confirmed conspiracy&#39; posted in a place which cannot be interfered with, certainly not on Wikipedia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good points. The definition of &quot;confirmed&quot; is itself unclear. Also many, perhaps even most, officially confirmed conspiracies  are limited hangouts - where the real conspirators (and their intentions) are concealed behind some hapless patsie or faceless terrorist group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your point? Is the point to compile a list of every single conspiracy in the history of mankind, or give people a starting step as to open their minds to the possibility of these things happening?</p>

<p>They&#39;re all confirmed as happening right? Despite public opinion claiming the contrary for an extending period of time, while also grouping those who claimed its truth as &quot;crazy&quot;?</p>

<p>So in 3 minutes I&#39;ve given you a list of things that were thought to be conspiracy that were fact, and were de-classified by the same organizations who actually conducted these projects.</p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;ll be happy to provide the definition of &quot;confirmed&quot; since everyone else seems to have issues with it.</p>

<li>Confirmed is if wikipedia says it&#39;s confirmed, because that is the establishment admitting it was a conspiracy---because wikipedia has been outed as controlled by the establishment by at least 3 people verifying that fact here including myself on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which brings me to another way something can be confirmed:</p>

<p>How many unrelated whistleblowers does it take for you to be convinced it&#39;s confirmed?  2, 3, 10?  20?  What&#39;s your number.  Let&#39;s decide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I considered it confirmed if wikipedia says confirmed (you&#39;ll see most of those are) and has references to US gov documents exposing it; or if there is videographic evidence that is corroborated by at least 2 government whistleblowers.  I consider that a triangulation.  I can talk more about the methodology, but since I wrote the list, it really comes down to me making an arbitrary judgment call on what is &#39;confirmed&#39;, but if you think something is not confirmed (OKC bombing is a great example) I can break that off into a &#39;unofficially confirmed, but c&#39;mon&#39; section</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like a good methodology. We want to be applicable for future entries in the registry, and this should work.</p>

<p>The problem arises, I think, when a conspiracy has been &quot;confirmed&quot; but this confirmation may be hiding something else. The example I used from your list was the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, which (like 9/11) unquestionably involved a conspiracy, but the people who were officially blamed were not necessarily the real culprits/masterminds behind that conspiracy. </p>

<p>Some &quot;confirmations&quot; are limited hangouts or decoys.</p>

<p>My point is that list is not a limited hangout just because mistakes.  You gotta stop calling everything a false flag or limited hangout and learn to trust your fellow <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> person.

<p>I have to wonder why you&#39;re even here if you think we are out to get you.  Seems like an easy problem to solve, start a new sub, you&#39;re the only mod, and then you know the mods aren&#39;t out to get you.  It&#39;s ridiculous to sit back and moan about the mods being a part of some plot to hide this information when we were the ones to sticky it in the first place.  Hell if we wanted to hide shit from you we wouldn&#39;t have public mod logs and we would just delete the shit we wanted to hide.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong about my thoughts, well I apologize, and I&#39;m not saying that sarcastically.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&#39;m suspicious of a lot on this sub and reddit in general. Probably not anything to do with the mods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was defensive.</p>

<p>There are a lot of issues with this sub and Reddit that probably aren&#39;t the faults of mods.</p>

<p>I enjoy this subreddit and Reddit in general, but I have no doubt that information is controlled in various ways.</p>

<p>This is a message board, so you&#39;ll get all types of responses. I wasn&#39;t trying to be melodramatic. I was only pointing out a conspiracy I had in a conspiracy subreddit.</p>

<p>I feel your response was in poor taste. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I do have a reason to be defensive, you literally implied that we were up to no good trying to make this post hard to see and do just enough to please the user base.  It was a stupid assumption on your part.  I have little patience for chicken little BS directed at the mod team, especially considering that this sub is the only one of its size/traffic that publishes it&#39;s mod logs!</p>

<p>The sticky was taken down because that&#39;s what we do with ALL stickies after they&#39;ve been up for a while.  People want some level of permanence with this list so we are actively working that out, keeping a sticky up forever keeps us from using stickies for a multitude of other things we frequently use stickies for so it&#39;s simply not an option.  </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t what his was all about, this isn&#39;t all about anything at all.</p>

<p>It was a sticky, it was eventually unstuck after a time.  Nothing unusual happend.  beyond that it was a great post that we are considering turning into a wikipage and having linked in the sidebar.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so exhausted with all the assumptions that because we unstickied a post there is some sort of mod corruption.  </p>

<p>Your &#39;viewpoint&#39; shows you have no interest in trying to inform people who are uninformed</p>

<p>To inform people who are uninformed we needs posts here to get as many upvotes as possible, so by handicapping all our posts we&#39;re going to get less of those &#39;uninformed&#39; people who we want to get to.  At least if we add &#39;confirmed conspiracies&#39; into the sidebar we won&#39;t be handicapping all our latest submissions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about balance, there are lots of important factors, but we&#39;ve got to make sure we don&#39;t lose our reach, I&#39;m all for improving legitimacy, it&#39;s one of the top priorities, as is reaching as many people as possible.</p>

<p>How is providing proof of known conspiracies at the top of the sub a &#39;handicap&#39; of other posts? To me that&#39;s not a valid viewpoint at all. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top post gets a significant amount more upvotes than the one in second place, lots of people are only passing by, the top post gets more of their attention.  By putting a sticky above the posts which have been naturally voted to the top, we stop the democratically elected ones getting as many upvotes and hence from getting as much attention/views around Reddit, so the sticky reduces our reach around Reddit, making it less likely that we&#39;ll be spotted by non-regulars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leaving the same post at top time all year isn&#39;t going to help much as the algorithm is time-dependent, if a new post gets a lot of upvotes early on and makes it to the top of the sub, it then has the potential to go viral around Reddit bringing in huge numbers.  If a post which had been there for months suddenly receives all those votes the same won&#39;t happen.  We&#39;ve also got to factor in that the regulars can only vote for it once.  It&#39;s in the interest of the sub to regularly get new posts at the top which get many upvotes, bringing a lot of visitors to this sub, then once they&#39;ve run out of steam get replaced with the latest fresh post which does the same.  By having a sticky at the top for months which has already ran out of steam (due to the time-dependent Reddit algorithm), the sub will have a reduced reach around Reddit, while the regulars will still come there will be far fewer newbies and passers-by i.e. fewer of the people we most need to influence.</p>

They sticked the informative post for a bit, good move, get the information out, but now move it out of the way to get new info out and expand the reach of the sub.

    <div class="md"><p>I never understood this list. For it to be a &quot;confirmed conspiracy theory&quot;, it would have to at one point not have been confirmed, but still out there as a theory.</p>

<p>This list just seems like a bunch of conspiracies of bad stuff people in power has done. I don&#39;t think anyone specifically theorized about most of the stuff on the list specifically prior to the declassification or whatever.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, seems like a pretty important distinction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking for the same thing...it would have been really interesting to read about the groups or people who wrote about the conspiracies before they were revealed true.  I&#39;m wondering why that can&#39;t be included.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a look at the list. I think maybe some historic (older than 200 years) conspiracies should be added too. This will help drive home the point that conspiracies are not only taking place, but are as old as human civilisation.  There really are endless examples in Roman history  for an area which is widely known in the west (most users on this sub i guess?). Maybe we could do some posting on the history request subs asking them for some specific historic conspiracies to add. This is a great idea btw.   </p>

<p>Lmao at the in-fighting in the comments. Get it together people. We are a minority in our beliefs. We need to stick together and put the spreading of this information first. Lots of people are waking up these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good Idea, I completely agree. In the future we may even vote to create a list of very mind intriguing/blowing unconfirmed conspiracies. You know what they say, if the heart believes-it&#39;s true ! I might wanna reformulate my post later but I think you got the idea.</p>
