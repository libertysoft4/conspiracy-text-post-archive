        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know where to turn to find the answers that I seek. It seems knowledge is hidden in the universities and institutions all scattered on a need to know bases. People specialize in specific fields, but really no one really knows the whole picture of what really is going on. If they know they are not telling me! I am tired of listening to conspiracy theories, because they seemed to be designed by the system, made to confuse the population. Stupid ideas of reptilians, NWO, human clones, New agey etc, etc. I am not buying any of it. All sounds to me like a big giant hoax. Someone is pulling the strings and if you are that someone please tell me what the hell is going on. Why? Because I am tired of the game. I am tired of it all, and I need to know, so I can find peace. Please stop torturing me... I want to break free from the shackles of the mind, and I am willing to do almost anything to break free.</p>

<p>The internet is all about youtube, facebook, twitter, instagram. Sites designed to monitor your social circle, and your circle of influence. Designed to categorize you as a human being. Video games designed to distract you from asking to many questions. School is there to make you specialized in a specific field, and make you an obedient worker. Television is nothing but an idiot box spewing lie after lie, and making you live life vicariously. Not covering the whole story. Media is just giving snippets of information and shaping public thoughts, giving quotes about how the economy is this or that. Fucking tired of this bullshit.</p>

<p>Then there is religion. It categorizes people based on believer and non-believer. There is countries with borders designed to keep people in place of control. Stupid politics. Grown ups always talking about politics and how they can do something about the situation. They can&#39;t do shit! They are helpless. </p>

<p>Stupid gender wars designed to make us hate the opposite sex. The government taking care of the children now. No longer is men the head of the household. In charge of guiding the family. The male is suppose to be the head! The wise old man! What the hell is up with that? </p>

<p>Now look at our environment it is gone to shit. Pollution everywhere. We humans rely so much on gasoline. Technology to provide free clean energy is kept hidden. That is what I want. Free clean energy, but no. This is not given, but suppressed. Our food has turned to shit. </p>

<p>It seems the more the population grows the more life gets worse and worse. More crowded the less resources available. The more people applying for jobs. Really makes you pissed off about the world. Everyone seems to be getting ahead, while I am sitting back talking shit about the world. Well you know what. I don&#39;t know what else to do. I don&#39;t know where to turn to for the answers that I seek.</p>

<p>This is what I am doing about it. Making it life goal to journal my life for 90 days. It hurts to think so negatively, but It is better to be neutral in emotion to all of this. I have taken steps to get more discipline. Basically what I want is this.
1. I want to make a portal to other dimension.
2. I want free unlimited, clean energy
3. I want to live forever, in a state of neutral emotion
4. I want to know everything about the world and all there is to know</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Vedas helped me understand what&#39;s going on. We took birth in the last phase of this planet called Kali Yuga. It is described as an age of quarrel, dissent, and hypocrisy. Everything gets spoiled. Everything that is presented as knowledge is ignorance. Everything that is presented as moral is immoral. Everything that is presented as good is bad.</p>

<p>Because we are disillusioned to thinking that we are just human beings (the body and mind) and no more, we suffer greatly. When one understands his true nature of spirit soul, he is able to transcend this doomsday and find true peace even in the worst conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Bhagavad-Gita: As it is&quot;, is a good place to start IMHO.</p>

<hr/>

<p>On your original question, I believe money is the main control mechanism. You even mention &quot;more ppl applying for jobs&quot;, do you assume jobs are the basis of the &#39;system&#39;? Most people spend half their time collecting dollars and the other half spending them on lifestyle. Again, the control you speak of seems to be right there, money.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t NEED all the crap we call middle-class. Like video games, vacations, new cars etc. All distractions as you mention, but those distractions of the result of spending a lifetime collecting and spending dollars.</p>

<p>If we assume that dollars are the foundation the house of lies is built upon, it only makes sense to strike at them. Remeber a few years ago GoDaddy backed SOPA (the piracy bill). Reddit organized a boycott agaisnt them, their bottom line was threatened, and GoDaddy changed thier position (lies surely). Money talks, bullshit walks.</p>

<p>The control corupto-corps have is a derivative of the dollars we the people spend on their products. Only by removing their means to corrupt will we have a chance at a fair system. Asking politicians to stop accepting bribes likely will not work.</p>

<p>The rubber meets the road every time we give up our power/money for something that does not reduce our future reliance on dollars. By engaging in a general boycott we can simultaniously remove support from a corrupt system AND build our own support systems.</p>

<p>For example, spend some money and labor today to install a garden. In the future you can get dollar-free foods directly from your labor. You get healthy food, Monsanto get nothing.</p>

<p>Another way to think of it is like this: The employers HAVE to pay the employees, but the employees do not have to spend/give the money back.</p>

<p>By general boycott I don&#39;t mean stop paying taxes or rent/mortgage, that will land you in hot water. OTOH there are now laws mandating consumer spending. Things like healthcare are &#39;waking up&#39; people in droves. Why? It is hitting thier bottom line.</p>

<p>ps - USA consumer spending is over 11 TRILLION per year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The great mystery is... That you are a slave in a very complex slavery system. So it has been for all of time. The rest is misdirection. See Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems the more the population grows the more life gets worse and worse. More crowded the less resources available. The more people applying for jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all a result of the engineering of the slave holders. They control the resources including land and housing, they control the value of the paper you receive for working that you use to buy the resources, they also control the majority of job offering businesses, and they also control the population density through immigration, sterilization methods, and the trending perception of promiscuity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good allegory to represent how we are kept under this illusion that we are not slaves when really we are. I think being stuck staring at shadows on the wall can be considered enslavement of the body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that was never Plato/Socrates&#39; point. The whole being chained to a wall in a dark cave isn&#39;t supposed to be the focus of the allegory. The point is that the people are unable to perceive things as they really are, they instead must discern the way of things based on what they see... the shadows on the wall. It&#39;s about being ignorant of the world outside of the cave. The people chained in the cave are not enslaved, they are ignorant. The point of the allegory is to get out of the cave and see the light, which means get an education, seek enlightenment. Again, it&#39;s not about breaking your chains, it&#39;s about overcoming your ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, even if you were in a favorable society that was full of opulence and freedom, you would still be imprisoned by the time factor, which destroys the body we live in. We are in an illusion. We put so much importance in the body and mind that we inhibit. To escape illusion, we must expand our consciousness outwards to include everything and understand everything in their proper relationship. Understanding the true reality in this way, one is indifferent to favorable and unfavorable circumstances. Gold and iron will look the same. Birth and death look the same. We will cease to be affected by things that happen to our own body and mind. We will instead live within everything and everything will live within us.</p>

<p>You must find love, not fear. If you find love for the root of existence, you will be indifferent to everything around you and be absorbed in constant bliss and peace, even after the death of your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This train of thought seems to stem from daoism, which I truly believe is true.  A simplistic explanation to explain both our animalistic and godly tendencies.

<p>However, as I post there are 3 others who have offered input; all worth of investigating &amp; understanding.</p>

<p>Your last paragraph reminds me of a quote regarding journeys &amp; destinations. &quot;Life is a journey, not a destination&quot;. Also, &quot;Two roads diverged in a wood. and I - took the one less traveled by. And that has made all the difference.&quot;</p>

<p>I imagine your &quot;wants&quot; &amp; &quot;goals&quot; will change during your 90 day journal experiment. </p>

<p>The PKD volumes may offer you some insight. I suppose you have researched Stargate Tech &amp; are an engineer of some sort. Nikola Tesla diagrams &amp; papers discuss free energy. Meditation/Yoga/Breathing Exercises may help you find moments where TIME/SPACE become less burdensome. Becoming omniscient is probably unattainable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I see things:  There are two major powers fighting for control of the world right now.  </p>

<p>Side A: Old power, they&#39;ve been in control ever since there was recorded history.  Slavery and addiction are their main tool set.  They are very jealous of other cultures and will artificially place themselves on a pedestal to stroke their ego.  If you don&#39;t go with their program they will collectively work to degrade and destroy your country/culture by various means.  Their goal is for humanity to revert to a earlier scientific state so their control is easier to manage.  They do not want full disclosure of other alien races nor do they want to promote any sciences unless it contributes to our enslavement.</p>

<p>Side B:  New World order/New world power.  Revenge of the Nerds.  They rule by means of information and adapting to conditions to ensure the population willingly participates without force.  They aren&#39;t 100 percent good, but more of a balanced system.  They use advance mathematics, science, intel and AI as tool sets.  They want to grow the human race and expand across space and time.  They want a type 1 planetary civilization.</p>

<p>The final battle plan between the two is generally called Armageddon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never deny that your ideas of injustice and perfection stem from ideas and streams of thought that have always been influenced by the entity/ies that you now relent. You have given many &quot;I want...&quot; statements, which is normally how anyone relates, using the self, but what you are asking for necessitates the denaturing, the distillation of the ego so it can be one with the id. The true nature of our reality is even unknown to those who manipulate others the most. In fact, they are likely in-line with the thinking you have exhibited in your post, but have selfishly sought solutions to the &#39;problems&#39; that they deem worthy to address. In short, I empathize greatly with you, have worn the shoes you are wearing, but would caution you from viewing the world as one occupied by sheisters. Instead, I find it more accurate that the world is occupied by and run by egotistical ignoramuses. Don&#39;t misunderstand, there are plenty of smarts to go around, but they are used for deriving schemes which in fact appear as beneficial to, but in acctuality control and subjugate, the populous en masse. Imo, this idea, that control of others could ever lead to long-term benefits for ANYONE is ignorant.</p>

<p>The divine inspiration of the bible is truth. </p>

<p>Satan is real and fully intends to play out the events detailed in book of Revelation through his agent Lucifer. </p>

<p>The fallen angels have been corrupting the hearts of humanity since the days of Adam. </p>

<p>Polytheism, atheism, scientism, spirtualism are all tools they employ to distance you from the one true God and to keep you from knowing your divine creator  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That presupposes that there is no absolute truth and nothing can ever be &quot;known.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe that to be a falsehood.</p>

<p>Truth is absolute, not relative.</p>

<p>Therefore they are varying degrees to which people can be aligned to truth.</p>

<p>I realize that&#39;s not a popular opinion in the age of moral relativism, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less true.</p>

<p>God&#39;s law exists and is enforced regardless of your feelings about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t pray for me. That is the saddest sad of all the sads. Your remarks are off the charts thoughtless because all of your &quot;truths&quot; are based on the Bible. If the Bible was the unquestioning cource for Truth, why isn&#39;t the entire planet Christian? Or, if all truths are in the Old Testament, why are we not all Jewish? I am attracted to scum like you because you believe that your opinion, inspired divinely, is the ONLY opinion and must be taken seriously. Anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with your Judeo-Christian slant is a &quot;poor soul&quot; wasting their time. You&#39;re the poor soul dude. You&#39;re the one living a lie. I know one huge truth that makes me more aware of the universe than someone like you: I don&#39;t know a damn thing. </p>
