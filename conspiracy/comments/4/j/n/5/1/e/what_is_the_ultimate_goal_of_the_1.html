    <div class="md"><p>Install a one-world federal government with centralized power. This is why they&#39;ve created the EU, and been wanting to consolidate powers by creating the African Union; American Union; Middle Eastern Union &amp;amp; Pacific Union.
You can see the schema with organizations such as the UN; IMF, all these worldy organization, while publicly appealing lead us towards a centralized government. The plan is to have a cashless society running on one world currency. Then you essentially control the whole world.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not inherently against a world government. However the crucial difference here is that the intentions behind this group (calling themselves the elite) are nefarious and very dangerous. They are the same people who funded both sides of World War conflicts and the subsequent wars (Korea; Vietnam; 9/11). These are all mechanisms that use fear and economic scarcity to herd the population in one direction. The reason we shall all be concerned by this is that this affects us directly in every day lives.</p>

<p>So whats the goal? Terrorizing the population to keep us under control and as slaves to the higher order.</p>

<p>Legendary comedian George Carlin said it best when he said </p>

<p>&amp;gt; Bullshit is the glue that binds our nation together.</p>

<p>&amp;gt; We have a Bill of Privileges. Not a Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>Reading Brave New World or 1984 is a good idea. The shocking part is that most of these worldly event like Terrorism were being anticipated for as far the 50s and 60s. In other words, it&#39;s not serendipitous but very carefully planned out.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone uses these technologies. Plus it is much harder to synchronize and track that sort of information.</p>

<p>If they require newborns to get RFID implants then it doesn&#39;t matter what the citizens do they <em>will</em> be tracked. If you remove the implant, or use radio interference, they would be able to detect that. Then they would jail you and give you another implant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s not the real world, because they are not a mandatory thing. They do currently exist however, and can be tracked/&quot;hacked&quot;. Just like how people can remotely steal your credit card info while you&#39;re walking down the street.</p>

<p>If the time comes that they are mandatory, then someone, even if it is not a government, will be tracking people. There are plenty of nefarious people out there that will not hesitate to do so in order to steal money and identity info. It would be easy pickings if newborns were required to get these implants.</p>

<p>Sure, my post was quite cynical towards governments, but it&#39;s not far-fetched considering all of the spying that we <em>know</em> they are doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, chips tied to your financial accounts, no money will exist in physical form making it impossible to participate in any monetary transaction without it being known what was purchased, who sold and who bought, and as a result all transactions will go directly through their system. There will be no black market because you will not be able to spend money without the okay of the government, because it is only accessable through your RFID chip. There will be no cash, they are attempting already to abolish physical tender now. They want complete control over every aspect of your life. That is the end game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would people not then just turn to something else for black market dealings? For example you buy a laptop or TV or something with your chip, they see you bought a TV, but then you trade that TV for a gun or something else. This theory seems like it would take a very long time to come into fruitation seeing as how the world is not anywhere close to uniting like they want never mind all the different currencies and countries without even a nation-wide electrical grid for the people. It just seems to me impossible in the way it&#39;s being explained I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know how you feel. However, you must keep a cool head. The more you know about their plans, the more you can anticipate their moves. And honestly, whatever you do, if you do it with a conscious mind, that is without the trappings of the system (which thrives on materialism and profiteering) , and with humanistic intentions, I believe you are already moving away from that direction.</p>

<p>The most important thing is for people to realize this. We are all like screws and cogs in the big machine because the pyramidal system works on compartmentalizing every action, thus keeping the people out of the real agenda. But if people simply realized what is it that we are working for, I think this can end and we would enter a new Age, one where we can correct the mistakes and set sail towards becoming an interstellar civilization. It may take some time, it may be beyond our lifetime but I&#39;d say it&#39;s a noble goal enough to strive for.</p>

<p>I suggest you reading more about it. Books from Jim Marrs or as I recently did, David Icke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve often wondered the same, what is their ultimate goal. Already they have pretty much all the money and most of the power so what else could they be after? Also I have to ask what is wrong with the rest of us that we are going along with this nonsense. I mean all anyone needs is food, air, shelter, and water to live, other people as well but those are the basics to exist.</p>

<p>What is wrong with us that we work jobs we hate, have hardly any time with our family because we must pay for the basics that should be there for everyone&#39;s benefit and up until a few hundred years ago they were. We get in cars that pollute, require oil that time and again destroys the ecosystem at many stages of obtaining it(Alaska, gulf of Mexico,  etc.) Its insane we keep shoveling money into hastening our own demise. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t quite comprehend the importance or value of money. I mean when you think about it, is there value in it inherently? Its worth only what we all agree it&#39;s worth, but this game is rigged. Its like we are all trying to play monopoly when all the properties have hotels on them and the safest place for you to land is jail.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think enough people ever really sit and think about what kind of life we actually live. Everyone is trying to get the house the nice car the best schools and all of the status symbol junk that means nothing in the grand scheme of the universe. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard a single story of a man on his deathbed wishing he could go back and work more so he could get those Jordan&#39;s or that bmw sedan or whatever possession you wish. You can&#39;t take it with you and rich or poor we all have the same fate, so why do we keep going along with this? It feels like insanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Feels kinda weird for people who live in luxury and have no regard for human life to strive for a utopia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think along the lines of the plot to the movie Kingsman: Secret Service. If you haven&#39;t seen it I won&#39;t spoil it for you. So instead I&#39;ll give a different but similar explanation.</p>

<p>Humans are actually over-populating this planet. Back in 1950 the population was <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762181.html">a little over 2.5billion</a>. All those &quot;citizens&quot; who are starving, poor, etc. are a threat to tptb. We outnumber them to the point that if even something like 30% of the population were to revolt they would almost stand no chance without nuclear war. Obviously nuclear war is bad for everyone on the planet, so they don&#39;t want to have to do that.</p>

<p>We also consume vast resources on this planet. Think of all the beef eaten in the world. It all comes from cows that require huge amounts of foodfood, which in turn requires huge amounts of land for farming. Not to mention they literally fart methane which <em>greatly</em> contributes to global climate change. Now take into consideration all of the other resources used and contributions to climate change that originate from us &quot;citizens&quot;. </p>

<p>So by slowly stripping away people&#39;s freedoms they can prevent mass revolt because most people do not see this as a problem unless it happens immediately. If you had a time machine to go back to even as recent as the 80s and told everyone about the massive spying that NSA, GCHQ, Mossad, et. al. are doing, noone would believe you.</p>

<p>Eventually when they have total control they can begin mass depopulation. In fact it may already be happening, just on a much smaller scale (think the vaccines, glyphosate, chemtrails, etc.) Once the culling is over they&#39;ll raise their children and everyone that is left to see all of this as a good thing. They&#39;ll convince them that it took great courage to protect the earth and the future human generations from the leeching psycho &quot;citizens&quot; that kept pumping out babies by the billions. Then the cycle will start all over again, and in a couple thousand more years the same stunt will be pulled...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could it be teetering for a long time? The whole point of teetering is instability. If it&#39;s been doing that for a long time, then it&#39;s stable by virtue of how long it hasn&#39;t fallen. If something stays in a given state for a long time, then it&#39;s probably more accurate to say that it&#39;s sitting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, obviously &quot;the 1%&quot; exist in the sense that some people are the richest 1% of people in the world.  But they aren&#39;t some single, unified group with any kind of agenda or plan.  Beyond wanting to stay rich, and mess about on their giant yachts or whatever it is they do, they don&#39;t have any &quot;ultimate goal&quot; as OP asks.  The rest of it is just a facade - a form of advertising.  Being part of the 1% is just another thing we&#39;re supposed to aspire to.  Keeps the economy ticking over, which is all anybody in power is really interested in doing.</p>
