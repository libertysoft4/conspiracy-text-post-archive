<p>They are far too comfortable in their lives to give a shit. Go to some mediocre job that pays alright, eat fairly well, excellent entertainment. It&#39;s not a bad life. So when we get down to quality of life for the majority this system is working pretty well. We collapse this thing and millions starve and die from lack of medical care. Be outraged all you want, but there is no alternative unless you want innocent blood on your hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem is leadership.</p>

<p>The people still need a strong leader to take them in the right direction.  To represent their views and rights.  This takes a special kind of person.  </p>

<p>Hopefully a person that does not really want any kind of power in the first place.  </p>

<p>The leader needs to be backed up with very smart people as well.   Even if we can trust that the leader is acting in our interest, how can we also guarantee those around the leader share the same ideals and are not corrupt?</p>

<p>The people can riot in the streets and crash the banks and start the revolution, but for it to mean anything, a new system has to be put in place that everyone agrees on.   That could take years.  Maybe people keep working during that time, maybe not.   It would however, certainly be a different world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing. Old leader can just as easily be taken over by a new who is equally as corrupt. I think for any real change people need to be willing to sacrifice their comforts. People need to become less reliant on the benefits society has to offer, only then do they hold the cards and not be easily misguided into the same situation we are currently in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think people will be willing to sacrifice their comforts. It&#39;s going to take something much bigger to get people to want change. They are going to have to LOSE it. The standard of living in this country is too high for people to actually give a shit and the PTB know this, so they keep it going for as long as they can. If the economy crashes, you can almost expect people to revolt because they won&#39;t have jobs to go to, they won&#39;t have gas in their cars and they won&#39;t be able to buy food. It&#39;s going to get really ugly before real change happens. I just don&#39;t think. at this point, anyone has or will have the power to change it on the inside without the whole thing crashing down first. </p>

Peoples comforts are given to them to keep them inactive as your post claims.  Are people truly happy though?

Fire has been around for hundreds of thousands of years, ample food for a minority of the world population however our diets are horrendous in the first world, the wheel has been around for thousands of years, life expectancy over 30 has been a rarity more so in civilization with hard labor slavery, poor hygiene, and close proximity.  Your arguments are not the definition of happiness.  They are merely aspects of security.  A happy healthy individual is much more complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is.....we as a human race would probably let things hum along fine, and without a doubt have the | A) know-how B) supplies and C) Compassion | as a people to provide for every human being on the planet, without any war or strife. Literally probably all basic human survival needs could be covered for every human living on this planet. I do not think that that is a stretch of the imagination at all. It is human greed that does the damage. And the greed has spread through manipulative programming. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t REALLY know what&#39;s going on in the environment......the water you drink, the air you breathe, the energy wavelengths you are exposed to daily. There is no telling what has been done and what&#39;s planned on the horizon by a misled group of &quot;eliters&quot; not out for the benefit of all humanity. Look at the U.S. - things are getting bad economically for the country on an industrial level, but smoke and mirrors have clouded everything and the public knows next to nothing about economics (neither do the economists, but that branches out into the corruption of true economic study to begin with), so they just blindly follow along, listening to the media and government spout false data to them. Meanwhile, pensions and 401k&#39;s are being looted.</p>

<p>This is all engineered to fail. And it is failing now. There are just way too many distractions present for a person to keep a singular focus for more than an hour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humanity could no doubt provide for the basic needs of everyone on earth. In doing so people like US citizens would have to drastically sacrifice their standard of living. That&#39;s the greed you&#39;re thinking of, the greed everyone of us willingly participates in everyday. So if you think it&#39;s unjust for those in power to hoard wealth and deny food/services to the poor; go sell all your shit and become an aid worker. You can&#39;t have a fantastic standard of living and get pissed the phantoms in charge withhold the same from others. Take responsibility for your part in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care about the hoarding of wealth by those in power. They are idiotic based on the fact that you don&#39;t need a tremendous amount of wealth to live comfortably as a human. My standard of living is actually pretty basic. I wear $4 underwear and both the socks I am wearing right now each have a small hole in them. ;) So, I think I am doing my freaking part here.</p>

<p>What I have a real problem with is withholding resources from people for basic survival, creating false economic upheavals and collapses to further a grand chess game amongst the hidden hands of nations, and the vice-grip of control held over mass populations.</p>

<p>I feel that if We The People could get military leaders with balls, we could take back our government from the powers that be, and after trials or tribunals for certain treasonous acts of our &quot;elected leaders&quot;, imprison the guilty.  We could press the restart button without too much trouble.  No doubt some would have to die, just to show that we mean business.

<p>Currently we have managers who are incapable of leadership and when a leader does poke their head up it gets removed quick smart.</p>

<p>The &quot;system&quot; we all choose to acknowledge as being the framework for our existence is fundamentally flawed and will never have a true leader. I for one, don&#39;t require a leader to tell me how to live my life. My inner moral compass already does that for me. </p>
