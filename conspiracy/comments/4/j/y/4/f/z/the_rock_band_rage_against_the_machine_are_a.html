<p>Hilary has already stolen this election.  </p>

<p><a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/65557-rage-against-the-machine-launch-countdown-website/">Rage just announced a countdown and a new website.</a></p>

<p>They only existed as a creative entity during the Clinton years.  And they never really had much to say about that slimeball president.   And they disappeared when there was a president, and a chain of events that were overtly worth 10 RATM albums.   </p>

<p>I bet they&#39;re gearing up to do so again, because the election is already bought.  They&#39;ll rant about everything but the incoming war criminal president.  </p>

<p>(Edit:</p>

<p>I need to say somewhere that this is just a theory that sprung to mind after I noticed a coincidence.   More of a &quot;something to think about&quot; than an idea that I am actually invested in.   I was a teenager in the 1990s, and a fan of their work then.   I&#39;m interested to hear if they have new music, because their last album was really great, musically.  But, again, it is a coincidence worth paying attention to.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably just a coincidence, but a strange one at that.   </p>

<p>I think PE was brilliant and truly revolutionary.   I became skeptical of RATM when they disappeared for the Bush II years.   Hell, they should have released 8 albums between 2002 and 2004 alone.   There was more than enough fuel for song material.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of those things where neither the Clintons nor the band intentionally contributed to the rage being completely mis-directed and a decade too early. It happened, instead, because another band with a more encompassing message and during the right time period would not have been allowed to be in the mainstream.</p>

<p>I was in high school and college for the entire decade of the 90&#39;s. RATM was music which almost none of the audience who listened to it gave a shit about the Zapatistas or the federal reserve. The Government had done nothing but give us a great life. </p>

<p>RATM&#39;s audience were rich white kids who had access to affordable college and jobs waiting for them in an economy that was booming during a time of (in the mainstream) little to no war or strife. The cold war had just ended, America had won! Bill could do no wrong (Lewinsky made sure no one really paid attention to what he was doing)! The economy was great! Pop culture was at its apex! </p>

<p>It was all illusion, because the machine was working so well even the band didn&#39;t know how to properly rage against it.  They had legitimate complaints but they were largely about minority issues in a country that just didn&#39;t give a fuck about anybody who wasn&#39;t white.</p>

<p>Truth is, the band had to sellout to the machine to even be heard in the mainstream.</p>

<p>The song during the closing credits of The Matrix works supremely well as an ironic wake-up call. I guess pop culture has been used to control the masses by appearing to be on their side while actually serving the ruling class. Shocking. </p>

<p>My point is that the most apparent Matrix is a false one designed to lead those who seek to break free right to the entrance of the next... and so on. Enough layers and many will stop early, thinking they are finally free.</p>

<p>Also, I agree with you, they are cashing in and aren&#39;t going to say anything truly disruptive or the label won&#39;t release their music or promote their tours or any of the shit they need from the machine to get what they want. Don&#39;t be too hard on them, though, they have good intentions. Almost everyone does...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>One of their biggest hit singles had an anti-Clinton lyric.  I&#39;m not going to give it to you, because this post is asinine and deranged.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This would make them a political tool of the Bushes, then.  But then you&#39;d have to explain Tom Morello&#39;s solo career.</p>

<p>I spent plenty of hours listening to RATM between 1993 and 2003, and I don&#39;t remember them saying much about ol&#39; Wild Bill, especially in a hit single.   You <em>could</em> cite that lyric.   </p>
