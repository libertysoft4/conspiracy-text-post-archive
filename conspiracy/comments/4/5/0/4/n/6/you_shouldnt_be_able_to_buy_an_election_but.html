    <div class="md"><p>Nah, we’re not barbarians. Torture or prolonged punishment are in no way something we should support.</p>

<p><strong>Argon hypoxia.</strong> Takes less than a minute, is virtually free, is painless, and is guaranteed to work. That’s literally all the more complicated capital punishment should be. Not this stupid combination of chemicals, not a firing squad (WAAA PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA FROM THE SHOOTERS; get over it), not a guillotine (though that’s actually the second most humane way of executing someone), etc.</p>

<p>It’s the ultimate “we’re better than you” to those who deserve the punishment. Dispassionate, swift, impersonal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although, for any other crime I would agree, to the point I don&#39;t believe in capital punishment due to the issues surrounding the current judicial process and the false positives that are overwhelming higher than reported - for her type of crime, where the sum of her suffering would be negligible at best compared to the harm she&#39;s directly or indirectly inflected upon others.</p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t a popular position, but, I really hate governmental corruption, I think it&#39;s the most deplorable crime against the citizenry.</p>

<p>Edit: It&#39;s insidious and corrupts those around assuredly.</p>

<p>On a different note it actually blows my mind the Democratic party (let alone any American) would be comfortable letting someone under a criminal investigation make a bid for presidency. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an ELI5: Let&#39;s say you work at the Pentagon. It is illegal for you to copy, say, US Navy fleet movement plans, to your personal hard drive - as these are marked from classified to top secret, for example. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much a specific statute, more of a litany of laws. She could probably be charged with some of the following:</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 793 – Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information
18 U.S. Code § 798 – Disclosure of classified information
U.S. Code § 1924 – Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material</p>

<p>And then the big one is 18 U.S. Code § 1519 — Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations, because she knowingly had the server destroyed, so there&#39;s no way of actually proving that the files were in fact &quot;removed&quot; or &quot;handed over&quot;.</p>
