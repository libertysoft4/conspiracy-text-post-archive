        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Aside from all the flat earth stuff you hear about, it seems to me that even without that no one should trust NASA just because they&#39;re part of the US government. I&#39;m not saying the regular people who work there are bad though, they&#39;re just regular folk. But NASA is a quasi military organization and therefore wouldn&#39;t it make sense that one of it&#39;s primary methods of achieving its aims is deception. But I&#39;m curious as to how people perceive NASA and if possible I&#39;d rather not turn this into a flat earth argument, aside from flat earth, what do you all think of NASA?</p>

<p>Edit: I should add the reason I ask is because the conspiracy minded people I know around here anyway won&#39;t ever criticise NASA or any science in general. They accept everything and anything from them and you can&#39;t even questions it. It&#39;s weird to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. NASA is directed by the US Department of Defense, and uses national security to classify its information.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/offices/ogc/about/space_act1.html">National Aeronautics and Space Act</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 20102. (b)  Aeronautical and Space Activities for <em>Welfare and Security of United States</em>.-Congress declares that the general welfare and security of the United States require that adequate provision be made for aeronautical and space activities. Congress further declares that such activities shall be the responsibility of, and shall be directed by, a civilian agency exercising control over aeronautical and space activities sponsored by the United States, except that activities peculiar to or primarily associated with the development of weapons systems, military operations, <strong>or the defense of the United States</strong> (including the research and development necessary to make effective provision for the defense of the United States) <strong>shall be the responsibility of, and shall be directed by, the Department of Defense; and that determination as to which agency has responsibility for and direction of any such activity shall be made by the President.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the &#39;national security&#39; defense, the command structure of NASA goes through the DoD and the President. We&#39;ve all seen &#39;national security&#39; used whenever convenient, and we&#39;re all aware the President is a figurehead of the deep state. Meanwhile, the United States has been in a &quot;National Emergency&quot; since they wrote a law defining it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth shit is blowing up and once you look at it and realize the theoretical nature of gravity, its pretty insane.</p>

<p>Before I get downvotes this has nothing to do with flat Earth, but no object on Earth can have enough mass to attract another (even though x and y axis force s are totally independent), gravity doesn&#39;t pull the inner planets into the sun, or the moon towards the Earth, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the idea is that &#39;gravity&#39; is really just an electromagnetic attraction, right? i like it, but i&#39;m still wrapping my head around it.</p>

<p>if that&#39;s the case, though, i don&#39;t understand why &#39;mass&#39; isn&#39;t attracted in a polar manner. shouldn&#39;t the earth attract one pole and repel the other?</p>

<p>but yeah i completely agree that flat earth is being used to cover for something real about the earth. i think the earth&#39;s poles each have an oasis of green life, due to the electromagnetic nature of earth. and that implies the <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> theory is right, which implies we can just snatch energy out of the aether, tesla-style</p>

<p>The equations taught in an introductory physics sequence for the gravitational and electromagnetic forces take a similar form (kqq/r<sup>2</sup> vs. Gmm/r<sup>2),</sup> but gravity is not reducible to electromagnetism.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an astronomy nerd, yeah I trust the scientific data NASA has presented to the public. However, you are right. Their higher channels are through the DoD and the executive office. I believe there are A LOT of things nasa has discovered/invented that has not been shown to us. With the defense budget as big as it is, and much moolah disappearing into thin air, I&#39;m willing to bet the MIC is developing weapons optimized for outer space and militarized spacefaring vehicles. It goes against an international treaty, but if you can put the cork on the bottle and lockdown LEO, you win the planet. </p>

<p>The stuff that is made public are vanity projects and actual important scientific discoveries for the sake of science. But who knows, just a gut feeling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m no NASA insider so I have no idea.  But if you research a little you will find that they have multiple communication channels between Houston and the astronauts. Anytime something odd comes up, it instantly switches to a secure (non-public) channel.  That alone proves they are hiding something.</p>

<p>Same thing goes with the video feeds. There are countless recorded video feeds that will play for hours and then once something anomalous happens, the feed is <em>interrupted</em>. Additionally, the ISS moves at <a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/282-How-fast-does-the-Space-Station-travel-">17,000 miles per hour</a> , 5 miles per second. It hauls ass. Yet we are to believe they all these anomalies floating in space near the ISS also just happen to be moving at the exact same speed and in the same direction? If they are all just ice crystals, then why does NASA tend to cut the feed?</p>

<p>There are many examples of published photographs by NASA that have clearly been manipulated/edited with no explanation. Either intentional blurring or backgrounds being blacked out for some reason or another.</p>

<p>There are anomalous objects that have been photographed from satellites that nobody will talk about. For instance the structure on <a href="https://www.google.co/search?q=structure+on+phobos&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">Phobos</a>  that was mentioned here by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaiSfn8jlxY">Buzz Aldrin on C-Span</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t broadcast my entire life to the world, does that prove I&#39;m hiding something? Nasa runs a strict PR program and when odd things come up, it&#39;s best to not broadcast your internal communications to avoid being picked apart by armchair astronauts. </p>

<p>Are you saying its Aliens? Because I want you to think about how much more advanced an alien race would have to be to make it to earth. If aliens didn&#39;t want us to see them, we wouldn&#39;t see them. If they did want us to see them, NASA couldn&#39;t stop it.</p>

<p>The best you have is a blurry picture of a rock on Phobos and an astronaut trying to spark interest in space exploration to get more funding. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that NASA isn&#39;t the only one with satillites. In order to supress information like that, they would need cooperation from literally every agency that has satillite capability. News channels, weather stations, radio comm companies.... do you really think that all these entities would willing and/or able to keep a secret like that?</p>

<p>What about all the explorers who physically go to the poles? Does NASA keep a sentry up there to confiscate cameras and intimate the people into not talking?</p>

<p>Well I don&#39;t see why all of them couldn&#39;t be lying together sold as a franchise as a great way to extract money from their populations. That being said, I can see some aspects of NASA, just like every other agency, having some legitimacy and doing some if not lots of real work too. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m more concerned about why people aren&#39;t more critical of NASA. It seems like NASA gets a free pass and most people just refuse to be critical and literally turn a blind eye. </p>

<p>A great example of another country PERHAPS scamming their people are bubbles coming from Chinese astronauts. I mean, how is something like that explainable? IT should really make people want to look deeper, and yet it doesn&#39;t and the conversation just gets shut down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay fine, lets say my argument is incorrect and everything is perfectly compartmentalized. I&#39;ll take a different direction. What have they been faking? What&#39;s the purpose? What do they gain? Money can&#39;t be it, there isn&#39;t that much money comparatively. Why would all of the space agencies of the world be in concert in deceiving everyone? It just doesn&#39;t make sense. There&#39;s so much for humans to gain from outer space, and exploring it. 
Also, I think your example is good, but it&#39;s on such a small scale. And how did they get caught? I&#39;m genuinely curious.</p>

<p>EDIT: I looked at the video. Mildly strange, but is it not possible for water to have come from the craft itself? Or a piece of debris is what it looked like to me. Does look weird though.</p>

<p>there are a lot, and I mean a lot, of examples that I just can&#39;t ignore. Problem is, most of them are being brought up by flat earthers these days, so it&#39;s not an easy conversation to have. In fact I have no desire to talk about flat earth at all, but, many of them have been examining NASA relentlessly and have found many major flaws in what they present us with. The most obvious one being that almost all but one image of the earth from NASA is a composite. Why can&#39;t they just point a camera at the earth? There should be millions of images of the earth, but there aren&#39;t, there is in fact only one that&#39;s not a composite that shows all of the earth, the blue marble that shows all of the earth. </p>

<p>The whole moon landing things seems suspicious too, especially with nasa coming out now saying they don&#39;t even know today how to get past the Van Allen belts. </p>

<p>Not definite proof of anything mind you, but questions abound and those who answer, especially those in power, seem to be unable to have an open discussion about what&#39;s going on with NASA without resorting to ad hominem attacks. So whenever a large group of people aren&#39;t even able to entertain an idea, in this case that NASA is a part of the military and full of shit, then you have to wonder how we&#39;ve all become so closed to finding answers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well it matters because composites aren&#39;t photos, they&#39;re just made up, look here for example <a href="http://cdn.petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2013/08/driftingaway1.jpg">http://cdn.petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2013/08/driftingaway1.jpg</a></p>

<p>Does a city exist in a little bottle somewhere? No! The way to tell if a photograph is real these days in to have a raw file, it&#39;s like a digital negative, then you know that someone actually took the photos. If someone makes a composite, then the whole thing is open to debate, and in the case of NASA, I know they have crews of full time artist creating photo realistic images of mars and other planets (just google any planet and see what comes up, real photos? No!! All fantasy composites. Why? Why can&#39;t we just have a regular photo. Some people&#39;s phones can take raw photos, it&#39;s really easy! Another example, is why can&#39;t the ISS turn it&#39;s cameras away, change the aperture (I&#39;m a professional photographer so I do know what I&#39;m taking about) and get some great shots of space. It never does this, doesn&#39;t that seem odd to you? </p>

<p>But I have no problem with agreeing to disagree, but I still think my point stands, where are the photos.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s because real pictures seldom turn out good, composites would always guarantee a great shot. But yes they definitely should show real pictures, even if they look shit. And take pictures of outer space, or things like the moon and mars? With the former, I&#39;m pretty sure they have to do a very long exposure shot to pick up planets that far away. And maybe the camera is fixed in one place? I&#39;m sure you know more about cameras than I do so I may have no idea what I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>The photos of that comet or whatever that they intercepted is real. So is the picture of Pluto, isn&#39;t it? There&#39;s definitely real ones out there. But there definitely should be more, undoctored photos.</p>

That being said, I&#39;ve actually looked into many space photos before, and each time I trace a photo back to it&#39;s source, it turns out it&#39;s a composite. There is no reason for this. None. well I&#39;m sure there is, but nothing logical. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re probably right in the sense that just because I&#39;ve checkout a couple of photos and they turned out the be fake certainly doesn&#39;t mean that they all are, but it still does suggest something. Imagine I was telling my wife I was off each night to go to work, but never could I provide her with any proof other than artist renderings of my boss and work place.

<p>(I can&#39;t find the clip where he really goes off but I&#39;ll find it shortly)</p>

<p>why all the vitriol and personal attacks. Why not just address flat earth points. Why? I mean ok, it&#39;s crazy, I get it, but let&#39;s have a quick talk about it. Why does everyone go bonkers. </p>

<p>Anyway, back to the cameras though, it&#39;s just weird. Camera&#39;s are very advanced now, and to have one full time on the earth, considering all their other wonderful achievements, seems like child play to me.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another example</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;The colors are only approximately what an intrepid explorer would see from the Moon,&quot; the researchers write in a blog post on the Arizona State website, &quot;because the human eye is fully sensitive to all colors across the visible wavelength range, whereas the [wide angle camera] sees through a set of narrow band filters,&quot; the researchers write. The team goes on to admit that the compositing and color correction &quot;may be misleading in a purely scientific sense,&quot; but emphasize that this is all done for the purpose of creating a photograph that best represents what we&#39;d see if we were on board that spacecraft. &quot;</p>

<p>taken from here <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/18/10585198/nasa-new-earthrise-photo-earth-moon-apollo-8">http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/18/10585198/nasa-new-earthrise-photo-earth-moon-apollo-8</a></p>

<p>so ya, see, not a real photo because a regular camera just wouldn&#39;t do it...</p>

<p>it&#39;s reeks of bs to me. </p>

<p>I hope someone corrects me though, I&#39;m always open to being wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the logical reason would maybe to keep people interested? If they see a picture of an object and it&#39;s really drab and not impressive, they might scoff and be like &quot;that&#39;s not as cool as I thought it would be&quot; or whatever. Not a very strong theory on my end but that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got right now. That&#39;s a pretty good comparison, I would like to see a #nofilter picture of earth and Mars and all that jazz.

<p>Neil is an asshole, too much ego. I do think flat earth is hilariously stupid, but sure he should (I&#39;m assuming he doesn&#39;t I haven&#39;t watched the video yet) debunk each of the points in turn. </p>

<p>And I think having a camera always pointed at earth is important for weather data, cloud patterns, volcanic ash clouds, all sorts of stuff. And the fascination in our planet of course, maybe even ego a bit haha. 
I think that they&#39;re launching (or maybe have already launched?) a big telescope soon, that will be able to see farther and more stuff than the good old Hubble scope.</p>

So whenever a large group of people aren&#39;t even able to entertain an idea, in this case that NASA is a part of the military and full of shit, then you have to wonder how we&#39;ve all become so closed to finding answers</p>
