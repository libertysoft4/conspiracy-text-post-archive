        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d never heard of this until I noticed someone included it in their top 10 most intelligent shows.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubicon_(TV_series)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubicon_(TV_series)</a></p>

<p>It was cancelled due to &#39;low viewership&#39;, despite AMC being very proud of it and it generally being received very well.  Its conspiratorial, secret society theme was <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/12/rubi-d02.html">&#39;too close to home&#39;</a>, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s not on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon, nor are there plans to release it on DVD.</p>

<p>The fact that it&#39;s not even to be released on DVD means it needs a look.  I imagine it&#39;s still on bittorrent and usenet.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: so I&#39;ve been watching rubicon and I get why they are suppressing it.  Here&#39;s a short list so far, and I&#39;m halfway through the season.</p>

<ul>
<li>Show is about a &#39;fictional&#39; intelligence consultancy called API or American Policy Institute which employs analysts who interpret data from the various alphabet agencies for meaning and actionability.  I guess they don&#39;t want people to know that our intelligence is not intelligent enough to do intelligence that they have to hire people.</li>
<li>FBI raids API offices because of an alleged leak.  The employees are held there and each given a polygraph test.  One of the main characters is asked if he ever cheated on his wife.  The tester said, &quot;it&#39;s important that you&#39;re honest about any <strong><em>potential vulnerabilities..anything that can be leveraged against you in exchange for information&quot;</em></strong>  Mr. Test asserts he hasn&#39;t cheated on his wife &quot;it&#39;s telling you I&#39;m lying.  But I never cheated on my wife.  Write that down please&quot;.  To which the tester said, &quot;<em>Maybe you haven&#39;t cheated on her but in my opinion you will. In your mind you already have.</em>&quot; --  &quot;I love my wife.&quot; -- &quot;Let&#39;s move on.  Are you a member of any terrorist organizations.&quot;</li>
<li>OK towards the end of the season, Will discovers that the there are people receiving the analysis and direction from API who are profiting from world military events, disaster, etc; and even says he believes they are engineering those events.  <strong>There you have it: Rubicon was saying what we say here all the time, that the global spook networks are false flagging and profiting</strong>  This is why Rubicon was not only canceled but pulled from the shelves.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>relevant : Brilliant but troubled code-cracker Will Travers ( James Badge Dale ) works as an analyst at a federal agency in New York City. Unstable since losing his wife and daughter in the 9/11 attacks, he considers quitting until his father-in-law and mentor dies in a train accident that Travers suspects wasn&#39;t an accident at all.</p>

<p>probably woulda gotten into 9/11 only not in the way that &quot;they&#39; want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serenity and Firefly were epic.  I really liked Joss&#39; Dollhouse a lot also--thought it was an excellent concept; but talk about being close to home (the concept of monarch sex robots / superspies....through the contrivance of scifi brain reformatting)  It&#39;s why it didn&#39;t survive, though Whedon would never say so.</p>
