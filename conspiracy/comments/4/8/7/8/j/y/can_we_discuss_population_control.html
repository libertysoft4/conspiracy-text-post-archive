        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It took our species millions of years to reach one billion people just over a century ago. In my lifetime alone, we have increased from 6 to 7.5 billion. I think everyone would agree that this exponential growth is unsustainable and possibly our greatest threat as a species, much more than climate change in my opinion.</p>

<p>We rarely hear it discussed in the media, or in public for that matter. I often read conspiracies involving people worried that one thing or another is population control, and everyone seems to hate the idea of it. Of course the leaders we have in power are the last ones I would trust to be in charge of deciding who gets to have children, but what is the correct answer here? How will this be implemented in the future?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, let&#39;s talk about population control, but let&#39;s talk about it honestly, for a change.</p>

<p>The populations of white, Western nations are stable or falling. They are not increasing. Whites are not contributing to the human overpopulation problem in any way, shape or form. It is not our problem.</p>

<p>The overpopulation problem is a problem of blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. They are the ones you need to criticize if you are angry about overpopulation. They are the ones who need to be addressed if you want the problem fixed.</p>

<p>So if you are so concerned, go tell blacks to have fewer babies. Tell Asians that they must have smaller families. Let me know how you make out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your wrong about the Asians actually. Their birthrates are falling too. In Japan for example it&#39;s actually a growing crisis. The difference is basically first world vs third world. The third world has high birthrates, and the first does not. Probably due to a number of things. Feminism in the 1st world, social security, etc.</p>

<p>But yeah it always annoys me how people concerned with population control suggest stuff like young White couples adopt an African child instead of have one of their own. That&#39;s genocide. You don&#39;t fix the problem that way. You fix it by promoting birth control in Africa in exchange for some better infrastructure or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got this sort of figured out, but kinda confused.</p>

<p>You are totally correct that our exponential growth is the greatest threat to us as a species.</p>

<p>What you miss is that we already killed ourselves, by creating climate change that is now beyond unstoppable.</p>

<p>So, population control is a done deal.</p>

<p>Now, the interesting part relates to the media, the government, and so on.  Well, consider this: the catastrophic climate change model requires that the oceans absorb heat from the climate, and become warmer.</p>

<p>NASA has released observations claiming that the oceans are warming, based on surface temperatures mostly.</p>

<p>But the US Navy, and all the other world navies, go to great lengths to measure the temperature of the ocean in volumetric models, using sonar refraction to make a 3-D map of the warm and cool bodies of water within the ocean.</p>

<p>So, the US Navy knows a yes-or-no answer as to whether we have destroyed the climate.  And they haven&#39;t said anything.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, there are all sort of pieces of information indicating that the elite are either trying to get off the planet, or otherwise preparing for a major disaster.</p>

<p>So, I think you have your answer in what&#39;s going on around you.  Population control is happening right now.</p>

<p>The elite aren&#39;t planning to save everybody, only themselves.</p>
