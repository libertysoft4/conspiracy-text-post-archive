<p>I&#39;ll always support free speech just as I&#39;ll always rail against perversions of it which represent dominance by a minority willing to step outside the legal bounds (vote brigading, multiple accounts etc.) to create a flase impression of majority opinion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually quite relevant here to mention the fact that Hitler was legally elected (Brownshirts).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lack of independent media and freespeech  helped dark triad Hilter rise to power. American corporate funding also didn&#39;t help. More freespeech could have prevented the rise of Hilter. A strong independant media could have exposed Hilter for the evil man he was rather than being voted Time magazine man of the year.

    <div class="md"><p>Free speech is awesome.  A minority of hateful people diverting rational and polite discussion into generalized hatred of a religious or racial or cultural group is exactly what Hitler did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed man of the year was meant to denote &quot;best&quot; man of the year.  Did Time expose him for the monster he was known to be? The mainstream media was as  at fault,  maybe more, for the rise of Hilter than the brownshirts. Hilter wasn&#39;t named man of the year in 1943 even though he was the most influential man of that year. This is just a corporate PR spin from a rag of a magazine called Time. F the mainstream media. Absolute freespeech and an independent diverse media is the answer.  Not the problem. Censorship pushes speech underground. Adults don&#39;t like to be treated like children and told what they can or can&#39;t say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, censorship does suck.  I have not argued that the posts I dislike be censored.  Only that those comment have changed this sub from a place for rational discussion into a hate-filled circlejerk.</p>

<p>Also relevant is that years ago when I worked in a copy shop someone brought in a vintage 1933 (I think October) NYT page with a front page article talking about how great Mussolini&#39;s Italy was.  This was, of course, about 1 year before the plot that Smedly Butler alleged was the planned time for a fascist takeover of America.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the mainstream media tells us the truth, just that a grossly biased anti-Jewish bias serves a different yet no better agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rational debate and the validity and eloquence of my views are irrelevant.  99% downvotes of things that even slightly suggest that that all Jews aren&#39;t evil or that the post is applying a double standard, is antisemitic etc. are silent.  The vast majority of the respondents who bother to post anything either accuse of being a shill or assume I am a Jew generally provide nothing in the way of rebuttal, just routinely snide and often sometimes bigoted insults.  </p>

<p>These people are an over-represented virulent minority that render cogent argument and rational debate completely moot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of ugly on Reddit in general. I posted something about a possible sleeper cell being taken out and a bunch of whiny racists jumped in to bitch about the fact that the news covered some Muslim guys dying and used it to rail against both Muslims and Blacks. Our top-voted post the last few days was a stupid (and incorrect) meme about the wage gap - which was not even a conspiracy - that brought every sexist teen and his pappy out to play.</p>

<p>But there were a lot of good comments in both threads, too, and actually some good conversation if you could get past the &quot;LOLZ Feminsmsms/Mooslims/Blackz ow my ballz&quot; brigaders (most of the culprits weren&#39;t regulars to the sub).</p>

<p>This, unfortunately, is Reddit, and, I fear, the world at large (look who the media wants us to choose from for President, ffs - an avaricious fascist or a sentient circus peanut fascist) and there&#39;s shit-all we can really do about it except keep rowing through it. Or turn off the computer and stop talking to friends/relatives/strangers forever...</p>

<p>Sometimes it sucks, I know I questioned and still do question myself for spending too much time on Reddit after my couple of arguments with the lolboys (none of which were regulars, btw), but I like it here, I like the people here, I like the topics and discussions here, and if I can wade through the stupid, there&#39;s a lot of good to be had and a bunch of good, smart, and well-meaning people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your choice to leave, I guess, but the best way to combat bigotry and stupidity is to point it out. Pretending it doesn&#39;t exist ain&#39;t gonna help, letting it pass uncommented on ain&#39;t gonna help, either (also, metathreads are likely not to help - better to comment in whichever threads you&#39;re referring to to combat propaganda if you believe it to be propaganda).</p>

<p>As I said.  8 years here.  The last 4 have been a complete waste of time as my opinions and those of others that don&#39;t fall into step with bigotry are not really visible because they are so heavily downvoted.  Pointing out that that graph was a eogery got downvoted <em>after</em> it was removed from the link listings on /conspiracy which means that people messages otehrs to come downvote me which means that antisemites are using the same tools to notify one another of posts and links to downvote/comment on as are the ultra-zionists they hate so much.  360-shitfest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a steady increase over the last 4 years. Now we&#39;re up to videos of Hitler posts calling on non-Jews to rise up against their Jewish masters with titles like &quot;He was way ahead of his time&quot; that get 66% approval. Also posts like this with flagrantly false titles that get 90% approval and slurs in the comments are generally ignored by mods.</p>

<p>White supremacist sites have been openly discussing using this sub as a recruiting ground for years. The irony is they&#39;re using the same tactics that Hasbara and JIDF groups are using to control relevant discourse on /worldnews and elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just see the great strength of Reddit as being its great weakness: one person&#39;s individual opinion used to matter.

However if you tell someone with the mental capacity of a 10 year old that Jews are evil and emphasize that to the exclusion of the evils of non-Jews you just breed hateful, misinformed drones.

Reddit has come to have a significant portion of users with the mental capacity of 10 year olds, thanks in large part to their slightly less idiotic leaders herding their flocks of idiots here to preach the word of Lord Idiot.</p>

<p>Well, I pointed out that that site was flagrantly antisemitic (&quot;All Jews are liars&quot; and shit) and I got downvoted.</p>

<p>I pointed out that another <em>re</em>post of a Hitler speech all about how Jews control everything and need to be overthrown was dangerously close to hate speech (that was the second posting of it in about 3 months) and I got hated on by people crying &quot;I&#39;m not antisemitic, how dare you accuse me of that?!?!?  Those posts wound up around 72% and 65% approval respectivley and I got downvoted for pointing out that they were nothing other than neonazi recruitment videos.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/47vlhm/oscarssowhite_may_need_to_be_updated/">this</a> gem from just a day ago.  It&#39;s a photoshopped pol showing Jews win all the Oscars.

<p>That post had 5 points, and your comment had 3 points. Dafuq you talking about? You&#39;re proving my point.</p>

<p>Hate speech? Are you fucking kidding me? Learn that others will have other opinions and there is no such thing as &quot;hate speech&quot;. The most vile speech is to be protected, if we want free speech (that&#39;s the damn point of it, not to protect popular speech). Grow a thicker skin. Sounds like you want a safe place.</p>

<p>That&#39;s as far as I read, go find a safe place. I must warn you though, there is no such fucking thing as a safe place. Deal with it. There are ignorant/vile people in the world, and rather than censoring them, you should engage with them. Maybe you could help change their views/educate them.</p>

<p>OK.  I happen to believe that black Americans should rise up and overthrow white Americans and end their oppression.  #Blacksupremacyisright.

<p>OK. I happen to believe that black Americans should rise up and overthrow white Americans and end their oppression. #Blacksupremacyisright. Now, consider if I say this endorsing the views of someone who was in part responsible for the murder of millions based on an attempt at racial supremacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool beans, that&#39;s your right. Just because some one says it, and then some deranged person does it, doesn&#39;t make you responsible/guilty of that persons actions. Speech !== actions. Actions are punishable. There are no thought crimes. This is what you&#39;re apparently not understanding....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call hate speech what you want but advocating or even defending Hitler&#39;s views on Jews is as hateful and pathetic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe to you, but to others it&#39;s not. You&#39;re not guaranteed to be not offended. This whole, I&#39;m offended, shut up, is what is destroying the country. There are no guarantees of not being offended. You can try and create a safe place as much as you want, but guess what, they could offend someone else. See? You in college or some shit? You don&#39;t seem like you have real life experience. </p>

<p>Also, there is evidence that there was no Hitler final solution to kill Jews. There was no &quot;holocaust&quot;. Prejudice, yes, but no different than what the US did to American Japanese/Germans/Italians. The only difference is, that Europe was the stage of the war, not the US. Historians are re-investigating that history. But, people like you, would call that anti-Semitic. Facts are not racist/prejudiced. Facts are facts, even if you are offended by them. Grow the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;m not campaigning to criminalize advocating hate speech.  One of the necessary downsides of freedom of speech is that people have a right to be stupid and say stupid things (within broad limits).  I just don&#39;t want to be a part of a sub that has been perverted towards hat speech when it was designed to be about conspiracies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m offended, shut up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never did I say I was offended.  I&#39;ve heard retarded shit like this my whole life and there&#39;s virtually nothing that will offend me.  I&#39;m saying it&#39;s stupid and it belongs in a different sub and that I mourn the loss of this sub as anything of than a place for people to circle-jerk about hating Jews.</p>

<p>I with these poelpe would shut up, but again, just saying they&#39;ve ruined the sub.  I report slurs and shill accusations...  The rest is just the disintegration of this sub as place for people to politely discuss politically hidden facts into a place to irrationally hate on a huge and diverse group of people based the actions of a few.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no &quot;holocaust&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not reading past here.  I&#39;ve examined all the evidence presented to that effect and it is all both flawed and decisively contradicted by much more robust evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>That is an opinion you may hold.  I strongly disagree, but your saying that does not contradict the spirit of this sub.  I have not and will not complain about it as it is not categorically a defamation of an entire race of people.  I disagree, but we&#39;ll let that one lie.</p>

<p>In the case of Jews it has to do with cultural cohesiveness and spending wealth within one&#39;s own community.  The International Jew by Henry Ford is rightly considered antisemitic but it goes into this aspect of cultural economic self-reinforcement and suggests that other groups should engage in the same centralization of wealth based along cultural lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we agree then. I would say Jews successful bind together and rise to the top of whatever society they inhabit, and for this reason almost always exert a disproportionate amount of influence for their numbers. I would say this is the reason that they&#39;ve been kicked out of so many societies and that when someone brings this up they&#39;re called anti-semetic. </p>

<p>So if you agree with all this then what is the problem? That&#39;s all anyone is saying and you&#39;re calling them anti-semetic, but you just said it was true. Do you not see a problem with an extremely small group rising to the top of and exerting a huge amount of influence on a society? Would you not think it was a problem for the U.S. or any society if 80% of movies were made by Nigerian people, Nigerian people owned every television station, and most record labels, and Nigerian people ran the Federal Reserve, and most banks, and Nigerian people were over-represented in almost every branch of government, etc.?

<p>Of course.  That&#39;s not the issue.  The issue is that increasingly in this sub all that is put on Jews, not the unscrupulous billionaires who exist in every society and religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a consistent religious minority sucks.  Jews haven&#39;t been expleeled from any nations as recently as would be relevant to Laplander-Americans.  The vast majority of the expulsions and pogroms came during a time and in a place where and when Christians persecuted other Christians for being the wrong kind of Christians.  What do you expect would happen to members of a small and relatively prosperous non-Christian religion?  Scapegoating for everything that goes wrong which is exactly what&#39;s going on in this now irrational sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey man, yeah the internet is shilled, fuck social media and all that but don&#39;t let it all get to u. trust your discernment and try to focus your energy on fixing this mess (be aware they need people to quit for bots to work better on people, keep up the up/downvotes guys...unfortunately it affects opinions too much still)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You love that we bombed out the middle East not because your a white American, but because your a Jew.  Israel first, right?</p>

<p>Btw, it&#39;s not conspiratorial at all to go to a conspiracy site and start demanding that one group become off limits. But your just doing, like I said, what&#39;s in your nature. Criminalising anti Semitic opinions is always on the to do list, intellectual freedom be damned.</p>

<p>By the way, &quot;diahreah monkey&quot; what&#39;s with you people and the constant scatological references?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For about 10 minutes.  A gang downvoted comment falls under the &quot;show more comments&quot; category.</p>

<p>Essentially your &quot;point&quot; amounts to &quot;it&#39;s visible for a couple minutes even though people actively hide it from any further visibility&quot;.</p>
