    <div class="md"><p>That started in the 1930s with the Frankfurt School’s hegelian dialectic. It’s nothing new.</p>

<p>On Reddit, you are forced to make a username to contribute. While you don’t have to connect it to an e-mail, you have to do so to comment more than once per few minutes. So, really, you have to connect it to an e-mail. This creates an identity that a user develops over time and craves to make “important.”</p>

<p>All the individual identities on Reddit crave one thing: Upvotes–for comments and posts. This means that a Reddit user is willing to sell a part of who they really are in the quest for more positive votes. This identity is no longer a true representation of who they really are (were). It is a pseudo-reality that only exists in the world of Reddit. Their ideas, comments, postings, and even language has been influenced and changed all for the sake of the coveted upward pointed arrow.</p>

<p>Truly anonymous posting is void of this. I can be who I want to be, post what I want to post, and say what I want to say without having to think about what you fucks think. Your opinions don’t do anything. Anonymity gives other users no way to devalue my identity. Reddit, by its nature, explicitly gives other users a way to devalue who and what you really are, what your really think. and what you really want to say.</p>

<p>Reddit, while claiming to be for “content,” is really against it. One poster on Reddit even showed a part in the basic coding of Reddit’s popularity system where votes over time earn the “front page” status quickly. What gets looked at more over a short period of time: the interesting post about something everyone should know, or some stupid fucking cat? The cat, because it’s easier to see, easier to read, and easier to process. It’s a joke.</p>

<p>Sure, Reddit has some positives, but it all boils down to this: Reddit allows other users to have the power to alter your way of thinking for the sake of favor among them. Anonymity does not. Oh, and one more thing. Reddit’s administrators censor and delete anything with which they do not agree. Not only are other users altering your beliefs, the site owners are, as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People create subreddits and moderate them initially. Once subreddits get to a certain level of popularity they <em>might</em> be included as default subs. The default subs are required to play by certain rules basically. </p>

<p>All of that is accurate as far as I know, but I could be wrong. Regardless, the politics sub seemingly shouldn&#39;t try to censor the topics discussed so long as they relate to a political nature.</p>
