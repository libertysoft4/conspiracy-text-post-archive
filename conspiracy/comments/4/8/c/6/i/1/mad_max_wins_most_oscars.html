    <div class="md"><p>Hi thanks for your great comment.  No I&#39;ve been banned 27 times.  This is one of the greatest action movies of all time that was ruined by this remake then decorated with 6 Oscars.  Not talking about your normal jew hate although I&#39;m on board.  This is as horrible as remaking Annie with black people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever seen Mad Max or The Road Warrior?  This was another remake because Hollywood has no new ideas.  They screwed it up so badly it was heartbreaking.  I hate child molesters and WA fits that.  Made Mad is a cult classic and the remake didn&#39;t need a new storyline with chappy costumes and an idiot playing a guitar.  This is movie magic that was regurgitated quite horribly.  Giving this movie 6 Oscars is a conspiracy because not only was the movie a disaster it shows that Hollywood will tell you that it&#39;s not and to buy it.  Thanks so much for your silly opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why and how would you make those assumptions.  Mad Max was the original and the Road Warrior not MM2 was the sequel.  Thunder dome was made way too late and was a piece of crap.  I&#39;m a huge fan of the originals.  Thunder dome was a money grab.  Not a film school knob and no you didn&#39;t come close to blowing my mind.  You must be an eastern arsehole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movie sacked ass and had no business collecting awards.  It looked like a child&#39;s movie with a stupid dumb looking villian.  The original movies are awesome and I credit him however he is old and tired now and he sucks at his job.  The academy s decision not to give a black person a nomination was their right even if you don&#39;t agree but to give this movie Oscars was a slap in the face to any minority.  This movie is shit.</p>

<p>Do you have a strong opinion as to which film should have won according to any of those wacky/technical Oscar categories?</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna jump on the &quot;good movie&quot; bandwagon here.  It was pretty good.  Charlize Theron was amazing.</p>
