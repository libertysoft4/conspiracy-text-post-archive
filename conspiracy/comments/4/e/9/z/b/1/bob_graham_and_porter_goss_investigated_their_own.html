<p>After growing pressure, Congress established the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, a joint inquiry of the two intelligence committees, led by Graham and Goss. Goss and Graham made it clear that their goal was not to identify specific wrongdoing: Graham said the inquiry would not play &quot;the blame game about what went wrong from an intelligence perspective,&quot;, and Goss said, &quot;This is not a who-shall-we-hang type of investigation. It is about where are the gaps in America&#39;s defense and what do we do about it</p>

<p>The Meeting</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Bob Graham and Porter Goss were with the man who paid for 9/11 as we were being attacked, also before that. The man was never seriously challenged about his role. Then Graham and Goss pointed fingers at Saddam Hussein and or the Saudi&#39;s, away from themselves. This is a tangled mess of links that together tell a story of treason.</p>

<p>Associated Press item dated May 30, 2002.</p>

<p>&quot;The morning of Sept. 11, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss were doing what the two intelligence committee chairmen frequently do - having breakfast together at the Capitol. With them was then-Pakistani intelligence chief [Mahmud Ahmad]. [General Ahmad&#39;s] task was to persuade Afghanistan&#39;s Taliban leaders to hand over terror suspect Osama bin Laden. As the three men talked over the knotty problem, an aide handed Goss a note saying an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. A few moments later the Capitol would be evacuated, and the following month [General Ahmad] was fired.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the Times also revealed that on September 11 -- while the attacks were in progress -- the two current Co-Chairmen of the Joint-Intelligence Committee investigating the 9/11 attacks, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) and Representative Porter Goss (R-FL), met for breakfast with the ISI Chief who had ordered $100,000 wired from Pakistan to terrorist leader Mohammed Atta in the days immediately preceeding the attacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general28/linked.htm">http://www.rense.com/general28/linked.htm</a></p>

<p>According to the FBI, Indian Intelligence and several press reports, the ISI Head was instrumental in providing financial support to the 9/11 terrorists. General Mahmoud Ahmad had allegedly ordered the transfer of $100.000 to the presumed 9/11 ring-leader Mohamed Atta.</p>

<p>How fitting that this is the same House Intelligence chairman Porter Goss who was having breakfast in D.C. on 9/11 with Pakistan&#39;s security chief, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad—who was later revealed to be hijacker Mohammed Atta&#39;s bagman.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/pressclips/2004/08/food_for_though.php">http://blogs.villagevoice.com/pressclips/2004/08/food_for_though.php</a></p>

<p>A Times of India (10-12-2001) story by Manoj Joshi revealed that Pakistani ISA Director-General Lt. General Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after the U.S. attacks -- confirmed by top sources in India, because of evidence produced by India showing his links to Mohammed Atta, the terrorist hijacking leader.</p>

<p>The Times said that &quot;U.S. authorities sought his [Ahmad&#39;s] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh on the instructions of ISI Lt. General Ahmad.&quot; Senior [U.S.] government sources &quot;have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit off-topic but still related.</p>

<p>The Warren Commission which immediately followed JFK&#39;s assassination was started by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lyndon B. Johnson (ex-VP, POTUS) </li>
</ul>

<p>It consisted of some interesting characters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allen Dulles - head of CIA.</li>
<li>Gerald Ford - later POTUS.</li>
<li>John McCloy - President of World Bank, Chase chairman, Ford Foundation chairman, Rockefeller Foundation trustee, chairman of Council on Foreign Relations until succeeded by David Rockefeller. Had a long history with the Rockefeller family, while in Harvard they taught him how to sail.</li>
</ul>

<p>McCloy had doubts of the official narrative, until head of the CIA changed his mind:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notably, he was initially skeptical of the lone gunman theory, but a trip to Dallas with CIA veteran Allen Dulles, an old friend also serving on the Commission, convinced him of the case against Oswald.</p>

<p>He stated that any possible evidence of a conspiracy was &quot;beyond the reach&quot; of all of America&#39;s investigatory agencies, principally the FBI and the CIA, as well as the Commission itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next up, the Rockefeller Commission. This one also investigated the JFK assassination and the CIA&#39;s illegal domestic activities. This is the commission that publicized MKULTRA.</p>

<p>The Rockefeller Commission was created by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gerald Ford (POTUS) and Nelson Rockefeller (VP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you guess who censored the report and redacted the 86-page section on CIA assassination plots? <em>Dick fucking Cheney</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The changes included removal of an entire 86-page section on CIA assassination plots and numerous edits to the report by then-deputy White House Chief of Staff Richard Cheney.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay now fast forward a bit to 9/11 - good old Dick Cheney and the Halliburton war machine. But what&#39;s he up to now?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Energy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Energy</a></p>

<p>Dick Cheney (ex-VP), Jacob Rothschild, Rupert Murdoch (owns News Corp) and James Woolsey (ex-CIA director) are on the board of directors for an energy company looking to extract oil from the Golan Heights. Where&#39;s that located? Right between Israel and Syria.</p>

<p>Where am I going with this? No idea, but it&#39;s damn interesting.</p>
