        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it&#39;s a safe assumption that Goldman-Sachs didn&#39;t pay a fortune to hear shitty speeches from the Clintons. Those &quot;speaking fees&quot; were clean, laundered, public money that was paid for services rendered earlier in their careers. </p>

<p><strong>What prior service would Goldman-Sachs so happily pay millions for and consider themselves getting the bargain of the millennium?</strong></p>

<p>Bill Clinton&#39;s repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act (also known as the Banking Act of 1933) of course. This one, singular task performed by the Clintons led to the trillions of dollars stolen from the American people by Goldman-Sachs and other Wall Street firms since its repeal.  </p>

<p>For all those who doubt I&#39;m right, just consider this... Goldman-Sachs lobbied heavily for the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, but lobbying a sitting President is tough when you can&#39;t just dump a truckload of cash in his lap. There&#39;s... questions.</p>

<p>However, solemn promises can be made behind closed doors for a massive cash windfall to hit the Clinton&#39;s bank accounts sometime AFTER his terms are done, but that cash has to be public and squeaky clean, and there&#39;s one sure-fire way for a former President and a First Lady to earns millions without ANY impropriety - the lecture circuit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfect. Absolute plausibility and deniability of any quid pro quo deals.</p>

<p>Just show up and blather for an hour or so and collect your cash. Easy-Peasy. Only one problem... you gotta look like you gave full value for their money. You gotta look like you &quot;told them what they want to hear&quot;, and while that may be problematic on the campaign trail, at least it avoids the question of <em>&quot;Saaaay... why would a smart, cagey firm like Goldman-Sachs repeatedly pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to hear someone scold them about their shady practices, to &quot;cut it out&quot;?</em> </p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t of course, that&#39;s silly. </p>

<p>But you can bet your ass they <em>would</em> promise to pay the equivalent of a few hundred bucks (a few years later) to a bank President who hands them the keys to the vault and looks the other way while they rob the bank blind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. It just looks like common sense to me, but I&#39;m getting backlash from people that claim this scenario is outlandish. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a simple case of following the money. If you&#39;re in a position of power such as the Presidency, and when you&#39;re done with that office companies that benefitted greatly from your actions in office suddenly start paying you a king&#39;s ransom for an hour&#39;s worth of talking about yourself, then the elephant in the room is... why? </p>

<p>Is the power of your celebrity worth millions to simply show up and bathe your employees in the golden light of your smile? They&#39;re ALREADY your employees, making bank themselves in your employ in the rigged financial sector.</p>

<p>What did you <em>really</em> do to earn that money? What did you do in office that helped them so much, that they want to shower you with millions for a few hours&#39; worth of policy babble and anecdotes?</p>

<p>Could it be the fact that you broke the lock installed in 1933 and then let them in to loot the vault a few years ago? </p>

<p>Nah, that&#39;s just unfounded conjecture I guess. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Fear.</strong></p>

<p>These are very, very, powerful people who aren&#39;t above taking your job or even your life if you get in the way of their juggernaut money train.</p>

<p>They take your cell phone and your boss instructs you and everyone else about the shitstorm that will follow if anyone fucks with these people and records in pictures, video or audio ANYTHING that goes on there. </p>

<p>You&#39;re literally taking your future career and possibly your life in your hands by taking a chance like this. What are you, an international spy? So well trained you can plant that cell phone without security (who&#39;s watching all the wait staff like hawks) seeing it and busting you?</p>

<p>The brave person with the balls of steel who recorded Romney by placing a phone behind the buffet table decoration and catching the &quot;47%&quot; remark got lucky and got away with it. They&#39;re on to that little trick now, so good luck. They sweep the AC vents, and check for hidden recording devices everywhere now, so you better be 007 with a Q or sneak a cell phone in and be at the ready and fearless enough to pull that sneaky shit off today.</p>
