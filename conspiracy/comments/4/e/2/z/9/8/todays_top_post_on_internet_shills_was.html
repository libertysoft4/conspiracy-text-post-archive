        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Definition of &quot;Handicapping&quot;:</strong> Removing a submission for a period of time to allow a competing submission to take its place as the top post. This is a hidden form of censorship typically disguised as a &quot;mistake.&quot; This is similar to a form of censorship where the mods remove a post during peak traffic times. There is a lot less backlash from the users if a post was reinstated. </p>

<p>This case of handicapping is an anomaly. It doesn&#39;t appear on the conspiracy mod log, so I decided to document it here. </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4e0tac/i_just_need_to_vent_this_obvious_reddit/">Link to post in question</a></p>

<p><strong>Screenshot showing that it was removed and then reinstated:</strong>  <a href="http://imgur.com/Tj1pDgU">http://imgur.com/Tj1pDgU</a> (I noticed this post dropped to number 2 around the time it was reinstated. Total duration of removal: 1hr 25 min)</p>

<p>This post is currently ranked number 2 on this sub, formerly number 1 and was obviously going to stay there. </p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Many users are simply not aware of the fact that shilling on Reddit and other social media has been openly admitted to. You may recal when <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/28/why_reddit_moderators_are_censoring_glenn_greenwalds_latest_bombshell_partner/">Reddit was censoring Greenwald&#39;s story on internet shilling.</a> I created a subreddit to archive information like this where people can easily educate themselves on the overwhelming proof of shilling, the whistleblowers, the mainstream media admitting to it, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Timeline of events:</strong></p>

<p>I posted a comment plugging <a href="/r/shills">/r/shills</a> and that can be found <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4e0tac/i_just_need_to_vent_this_obvious_reddit/d1w5fnv">here</a> at 14:19. Somebody removed the entire post 20 minutes later at 14:39. Finally, once a sufficient amount of time without upvotes had passed at 16:05, the link was approved at about the same time another link had displaced it as the top post, effectively censoring this thread for the vast majority of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers. </p>

<p><strong>Background information describing why &quot;handicapping&quot; is a problem on Reddit:</strong></p>

<p>The top post in any subreddit gets fed to the main front page of all subscribers to that subreddit. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has over 300,000 subscribers, but only between 500-1000 people actually in the subreddit at any time (see sidebar). This is because most people click the links on their front page and don&#39;t bother clicking the comments most of the time. A small percentage of people go into the comments, and a small percentage of those actually participate. These people are the ones who have a chance at seeing this submission that is now ranked number 2. They have to actually click the subreddit and check out the posts. As you can see, the difference between the top post and the 2nd is massive in terms of how many people view the content. The only other way these people can see the submission is if they dig through 3 or 4 pages on their main front page. (This post is currently ranked 131 for me, or 6 pages deep if I click &quot;front&quot;)</p>

<p>The ranking system for Reddit (hot) is based on how many upvotes a submission has and the time since it was posted. The older a post is, the more likely it will drop down the &quot;hot queue.&quot; Since this post was prevented from receiving upvotes for 1 hour and 25 minutes, it was &quot;aged&quot; without any upvotes, giving it a handicap on the ranking system. During that hour and 25 minutes, it should have been given X amount of upvotes, which would have kept it on the top slot, which would give it more upvotes so that it continues to float there for the rest of the day. </p>

<p><strong>Conspiracy Moderator response:</strong> <a href="http://imgur.com/MAztG23">Screenshot of the conversation</a>. TL;DR: Maybe an admin removed it, or there was some kind of glitch. The removal does not appear on <a href="https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy">https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>its happened to nearly every iteration of this sort of platform, digg comes to mind pretty quickly, once people realized it was rigged it was abandoned.</p>
