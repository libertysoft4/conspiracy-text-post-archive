    <div class="md"><p>I think those things are very possible. I rule nothing out because I may never be in a place to decide authoritatively one way or another in this lifetime. I am using this life to gather information and hopefully access some of the hidden realms to figure out if I have any sole purpose for my existence.</p>

<p>One interesting fact I just found out: my favorite tree is the Weeping Willow tree. I thumbed through a book called The Pagan Book of Days, by Nigel Pennick. In it, I found out that in the Celtic tree calendar, it is the 5th month (April into May). This coincides with my birthday, so it just hit me that perhaps the reason the willow is my favorite tree is that it marks the time period in which I was born. Thought that was cool, and further increases my curiosity on the mystical level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of it is real just maybe not in the way we define them. People with mental health issues are meant to be healers but the way we treat/ medicate them hinder their abbilities and break their minds further. Demons/ghosts/aliens/monsters are all real except they are not seperate categories. All of them and all of us are the same, we are just different forms of living things. If you think about how huge the universe is, and how much of our earth is unexplored/empty, there is a lot of room for beings we have yet to fully understand. They are all probably here they are just beyond our understanding, really good at hiding, and those that find them are often killed or devoured. I may be biased seeing as I kind of want all these things to exist.</p>
