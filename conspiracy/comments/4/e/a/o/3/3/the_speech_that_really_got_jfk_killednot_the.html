        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On June 10th 1963 JFK gave a speech at American University. In it he spoke of peace not as an ideal to strive towards, but as an attainable goal. Something within the reach of america in his lifetime.  The Military Industrial Complex was none too thrilled and it cannot be overstated how entranced Kennedy had Americans, most of them would have ran through a brick wall for him.</p>

<p>JFK was the last and only credible threat to the merchants of death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The military leaders and CIA couldn&#39;t believe JFK called their bluff regarding a Cuban War.</p>

<p>Allen Dulles sabotaged the Bay of Pigs fiasco, placing mediocre personnel in place for the invasion. He felt JFK would be pressured into war with Cuba after the unsuccessful invasion. JFK had other ideas and began a Washington political battle leading to Dulles&#39; ouster at the CIA and later JFK&#39;s life. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It has long been clear to almost all intelligent people who study the evidence that the Warren Commission was a cover-up. Something like 80% of those polled admit they don’t believe the Warren Commission report and we must assume that the other 20% are very gullible. Some have also studied the so-called conspiracy theories—the alternate theories, that is. But it should be equally clear that the alternate theories are, in most ways, just as full of holes and just as poorly constructed as the standard theory. Like the Warren Commission report, the alternate theories also read like propaganda. The style of all counter-stories, in whatever form, has been just as fishy as the Warren Commission story. To those of us trained to look at form as well as content, the counter-stories also read like a script, or like a transparent effort at mind control.</p>

<p>Let me suggest to you that both sets of stories were created mainly as misdirection and disinformation. This is not to say that all alternate theorists are controlled by the government or by anyone else. It is only to suggest that alternate theories—in all forms but one—seem to be encouraged by the government and the powers that be. We have always assumed that alternate theories would be frowned upon or discouraged, and yet we have never seen much real effort at suppression. In fact, in most cases, the dissemination of alternate theories would seem to be abetted by the mainstream, not suppressed. You should ask yourself if the alternate theories and theorists might be selling the main lines of the desired story just as fully as the standard theory. For the powers that be, it may not matter whether you believe there was one shooter or many, or even whether you believe that the CIA or FBI was involved. <strong>The only thing that is critical is that you believe Kennedy was assassinated that day</strong>, and the alternate theories sell that fact with even more emphasis and gusto than the Warren Commission. As it turns out, the alternate theories make a much greater hero out of Kennedy than the standard theory, and it may be that this is a welcome side-effect to the real conspirators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK came from a super wealthy family whose father had been an open supporter of fascism, even as an American Ambassador. JFK was not particularly progressive in his policies, or liberal in his ideology. I&#39;m not saying he was a reactionary or super conservative, but he was also not the progressive peacenik icon into which he has been manufactured. </p>

<p>In fact most of the policies hippies attribute to him are actually Johnson&#39;s, who was able to use the state of shock that followed JFK&#39;s assassination to push a few liberal-leaning policies that would otherwise have had no chance in hell, e.g. civil rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Late the conversation but you have the right track of questions. The main #1 question to start is &quot;How did old Joe Kennedy acquire his riches?&quot;</p>

<p>The answer is that he was one of those stock market investors who in the 1920&#39;s 1. manipulated stocks 2. did not give a fuck about the consequences 3. helped undermine trust in Wall Street and thus ushered in the Great Depression</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAH! Reagan was a puppet with nary a thought in his head. He did exactly as he was told. George Bush was running that shit show with his intelligence connections and wealthy friends. And after his assassination attempt by Hinkley, who was friend&#39;s with the Bush&#39;s, he pretended to run the country while Bush handled things.</p>

<p>So even if Bush was behind everything wrong with the administration, Reagan was as good of a president as any inanimate object could be.</p>

<p>He deserves zero recognition.</p>

<p>America&#39;s stockpile in 1980 was     23,368 and in 1985 it was 21,392.</p>

<p>Down to zero in the case means 2 thousand less. It wasn&#39;t until the end of the cold war that they went down by half. Which is obvious and not at all attributable to Reagan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were many crucial moments that depended solely on Kennedy. One of those moments in specific serves as testament to the fact that John Kennedy himself was our only salvation: when the Soviets sent more ships carrying nukes to Cuba after we already told them to get rid of the ones stationed there. </p>

<p>All of Kenny&#39;s top advisors were arguing pre-emptive nuclear strike on Russia. What saved the day was Kennedy&#39;s personal opinion that there were only two people in the world that that option truly depended on, and that they were both equally afraid of it. It was this overriding personal opinion held by the leader of America during the very height of the Cold War that kept America cautious enough to avoid nuclear war in general (despite the military industrial complex&#39;s influence) and, specifically in the situation I described, caused Kennedy to ignore all of his military advisors. The Soviet ships ended up turning around.</p>

<p>It was John Kennedy&#39;s handling of the Cuban Missile crisis, the event that marks the highest point tensions reached between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, that first rocked the Soviet notion that the Americans cannot be trusted or reasoned with and that negotiations with  them were impossible. The main thing Americans fail to notice when looking back on this moment of history is that, despite how the situation was presented to the American public, the Soviets were <strong><em>not</em></strong> the aggressor when they stationed nukes so close us. They only put them in Cuba due to ours in Turkey. Our nukes in Turkey was the one condition the Soviets had for not having nukes in Cuba from <em>before</em> they even put them there, and JFK&#39;s decision to agree to that demand was the only thing that brought the crisis to an end.</p>

<p>It was the extremely unique personal virtue of John Fitzegerald Kennedy, and extreme luck of the American people, that granted them the only anti-establishment President of the century during this darkest moment of theirs. President Kennedy permantly altered the course of the Cold War in the direction of <strong>peace</strong> by showing the Soviets that it might be possible to trust Americans, at the same time that he showed Americans that it&#39;s possible to work with the Soviets and be able to diplomatically resolve conflicts between them. </p>

<p>The Cuban Missile Crisis itself, as well as the dreadful fear it instilled on both societies (US &amp; USSR), was a symbol of how much of a runaway effect the tensions between the two superpowers became and marks the climax of tensions due to the cultural dissonance of two opposing societies. The way that President Kennedy handled this situation made reverberating cultural waves in both societies that prevented the relationship between the two superpowers from ever again reaching that level of tension. In conclusion and to put it simply, none of this would have come about had Kennedy echoed the military industrial complex&#39;s agenda and worked in unison with the rest of the political establishment like every other President would have. </p>

<p>EDIT: Added a bit of clarification in the last paragraph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done some of my schooling in the US, I know the official narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>What I meant is that it doesn&#39;t seem like you understand the virtue of JFK as President of America. As a sidenote, he was our only Catholic President. You gave me an article instead of just stating your point, so I&#39;m deducing that it&#39;s &quot;Kennedy put the missiles in Turkey and Italy while knowing the vast nuclear advantage America had over the USSR in both quality and quantity, and that the Soviet missiles in Cuba did not alter the strategic nuclear balance.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re being extremely ignorant. Catholicism has nothing to do with it. I&#39;m referring to the anti-establishment aspect. The way he was the only non zionist President we&#39;ve had.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I asked you honestly what the hell your point was with those articles and you completely ignored it. There are articles for every point of view out there. I&#39;m interested in what <em>your</em> point of view is. Do you even have one or do you just believe whichever articles best fit your preconceived notions?</p>

<p>What a weak argument and pathetic cop out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should look more into these topics--he was quite the opposite regarding all of those things.</p>

<p>The Bay of Pigs was a disaster, but it was one that he was pushed into doing by the CIA and military leaders who gave him bad information and in some ways wanted to set the U.S. up for failure to make Kennedy look bad. Afterwards, he said he wanted to smash the CIA &quot;into a million little pieces,&quot; and he fired Director Allen Dulles. He created a lot of enemies in doing so.</p>

<p>He was far from hotheaded when it came to negotiations with the Soviets and he and his brother&#39;s handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis (with the help of a highly intelligent and skilled administration) would be considered one of the crowning achievements of his presidency by many--especially as far as foreign policy goes.</p>

<p>Of course it was mainly a PR stunt, as the terms were ridiculous. It was mainly a &quot;we&#39;ll get rid of our nukes if you get rid of yours first Ruskies.&quot; Which the American admin knew damn well the USSR would never accept. But it provided a great PR fodder for the American admin at the time, as it allowed to paint themselves as the ones wanting &quot;peace&quot; and the Ruskies as the big bad nuke bears. </p>
