    <div class="md"><p>I would first recommend a mindfulness practice to take control of Your mind/senses and get to where no thoughts are running/ruining Your consciousness.
Next step I would recommend transcendental meditation.  There are some that report DMT like experiences after a certain level of proficiency in TM.</p>

<p>If You don&#39;t have time, You could try MDMA and psilocybin together.  MDMA will keep You feeling good while the psilocybin does the healing energy work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s clarify something. Psilocybin is a tool, much like a hammer, a screwdriver, or some nails. If you hold the hammer in your hand with a few nails in your pocket, and take no action, nothing will get built. You have to put in some work too. Eating drugs, or combinations thereof, WILL NOT cause spiritual awakening in and of themselves. The drugs are a conduit for self-driven experience.</p>

There&#39;s a lot of work to be done, drugs are merely tools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used Self and Other in reference to creating desirable experiences in our consensus &quot;reality&quot;.  Believe me I understand about Oneness, I&#39;ve been there with an overdose on LSA.  Knowing it doesn&#39;t make one a perfect saint automatically.  There are still groups of people I must allow myself to forgive who&#39;ve caused me pain and suffering in life (freight brokers come to mind).
Karma, Causality (cause/effect) make sense when one has experienced the Oneness.  You&#39;re only ever hurting aspects of the Self when in ignorance, derived from the limitations of the human mind, we think we are separate and hurting others.
Of course negative actions come back, because You&#39;re hurting Your Self.  Nobody is outside the Oneness of all creation, both manifested and unmanifested. </p>

I don&#39;t recommend that.  Depersonalization/Derealization is the worst thing that can happen to one following a gargantuan dose. </p>

<p>I recommend going light. 
Especially with non-DMT based psychedelics such as LSD/LSA.
I prefer DMT based psilocin  (4-hydroxy-DMT) because DMT is already endogenous in our body. 
Mushrooms are the best in my experience.  </p>

I honestly didn&#39;t know about the dosages and since it was my first extraction with any substance I didn&#39;t even know/believe if it was going to work.  I followed the directions for extraction to the letter but just due to ignorance and inexperience with the substance I really went overboard and took way too much.  </p>

I understood then why people commit suicide.  Most don&#39;t want to quit the world.  People want the unbearable pain to stop. 
It gave me an incredible understanding and compassion for people suffering this way.</p>

<p>In those 3 months prior I tried to get mushrooms from people I met and knew and nobody came through for me.  If I had taken a psilocybin dose it would have cured my depression for the next 18 months as it has in the past. 
Instead I now have Depersonalization/Derealization disorder which I have to take modafinil and hemp oil for to keep my symptoms under control.
It&#39;s really sad that one of the best if not the best anti-depressant drug (psilocybin) is not available legally for people that are suffering.
I really hope Bernie gets into office as he has as vowed to end the war on drugs. </p>

You can&#39;t just wholly depend on consuming mushrooms to not get depressed. Sure they help but you can&#39;t depend on them for it.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t pity myself.  I&#39;m just describing the facts.<br/>
It is easy to say go find a hobby and physical activities when my job during the time working 18 hour days as an over the road truck driver and staying on the road for 3 months at a time meanwhile only to return home and still be broke because the job doesn&#39;t pay enough.<br/>
I&#39;ve recently sold my truck and am now lookin for another job outside the deregulated trucking industry that has been going down hill since deregulation in the 80s. 
This trend of blaming people for suffering is not good.  Describing reality honestly is not self pity.  I&#39;m sorry You feel that it is.  Many on this planet suffer far worse under this global corporate fascist police state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is blaming you for suffering. I&#39;m just saying that the way you word things and blame external forces sounds like you refuse to take any personal responsibility. It&#39;s not healthy to have the mindset of &quot;the only thing that can fix me is mushrooms because the world is unfair.&quot; self pitying and defeating behavior is temporarily gratifying but not a solution to a problem. I&#39;m just saying, try to stay open minded rather than focusing in on one solution for your self pity party. </p>

<p>Edit: also I worked as a freight broker so I can tell you that your sob story about an unregulated trucking industry is bullshit. Plenty of drivers make tons of money and certainly don&#39;t drive 18 hours a day which is illegal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, a freight broker.  It makes sense now that You&#39;re a person with zero compassion for others.
Please don&#39;t drag me into a pointless exercise of will and facts which You would lose as I have unlimited time to eviscerate ignorance with knowledge and wisdom.<br/>
Over my 12 year driving career I&#39;ve talked to many &quot;brokers&quot; and they&#39;re professional liars by default.
I&#39;ve pulled loads that the broker gets paid $12,000 for sitting on his ass answering phones and only pays the owner operator $2000 who has to drive a heavy load across mountains with snow and ice.  Meanwhile it is truckers who do %99 of the work and suffer a shortened life span (17 years) by virtue of just living this lifestyle (stress, shitty food, not enough time off etc.) let alone never have a real home life, family and friends.
18 hour days is normal if You want to turn miles.  Old School truck drivers do not run Regs because they can&#39;t afford to.
The only reason the DOT was created was to force the wholesale creation of massive monopolies.
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/28/trucking-used-to-be-a-ticket-to-the-middle-class-now-its-just-another-low-wage-job/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/28/trucking-used-to-be-a-ticket-to-the-middle-class-now-its-just-another-low-wage-job/</a></p>

<p>Owner operators went from making doctor level income before deregulation to barely making ends meet and running 10 to 11 months out of the year.
When operating costs are over $1.00/mile yet brokers want to pay $1.3 to $1.5 per mile when company drivers make minimum $0.40/mile You come here claiming good money? You&#39;re delusional or a liar.
Minimum freight charge for dry van should be $2.50 and we still wouldn&#39;t be where it was in 1980 if adjusted to inflation which would be $3.60 today.
Brokers are the reason this industry sucks and truckers aren&#39;t making any money.  You&#39;ve directly profited from the corporate fascist policies of deregulation and the suffering of others.  Trucking is the worst job in this country and the only industry i know of without a minimum wage.
Try going over the road for 11 months out of the year and come come broke and tell me this industry is awesome.  Please, this is just me venting a fraction of my capacity. 
Why are You even in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  I think <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a> might be better for someone of Your character and nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol wow, way to label people based on a job, that really matches your open minded peace and love hippy narrative. First off, no one forced you to be a truck driver.  Either way, I know plenty of drivers that locked down dedicated routes, with my assistance and/or others, and made thousands a week working 3 to 4 days. The fact that you weren&#39;t motivated enough to build relationships and network in an industry completely built around such is your fault and your fault alone. Although with your shit attitude and victim complex it makes a lot of sense as to why you wouldn&#39;t be able to build a good relationship with a logistics coordinator, broker, or customer. The government doesn&#39;t owe you for your failures at your job. Routes are paid for based on supply and demand. Your numbers are complete and utter bullshit. During winter in Buffalo for example you can&#39;t pay anyone enough money to do certain routes.You exemplify everything that is wrong with sad unmotivated Sanders supporters that think he&#39;ll save them with free shit. Get a grip, homie.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders&#39; favorable rating in National polls was only 4% last year January and now is at 44% and the chart shows a gradual steady climb while Shillary&#39;s approval rating is dropping like the Panama Papers on billionaires.</p>

<p>This is despite the corporate infotainment propaganda networks consistent attacks and slander against Bernie Sanders over the past year.  He&#39;s still rising in National Polls.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure but psychedelics are not a magic pill towards ultimate Self realization and piece of mind.  They are great for people who need help now to heal from some form of physical or mental trauma, however they must be respected, understood and taken only with the proper intent set and setting. 
If one takes psychedelics and then does not endeavor to develop a daily spiritual practice of some sort then it&#39;s kind of a moot point. 
The goal ought to be greater wisdom, understanding and ultimately compassion which will bring Piece of Mind.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;ve learned from my experience with LSA and Depersonalization/Derealization.</p>

<p>The love of self cannot proceed, so long as the judgement of others is not released.  We are all One.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hold no resentment.  If You read up on Depersonalization/Derealization which is what I have now after LSA, the suffering of existential terror gives one a first row seat into this &quot;reality&quot; and after produces an enormous amount of compassion.  As a matter of fact if I encounter someone who claims to suffer from DP/DR yet still carries and displays judgements and resentments towards &quot;the other&quot; chances are they are not experiencing DP/DR. 
DP/DR to me feels like all matter/energy is all one consciousness and Oneness that we are really only fragments of the same totality. 
The anxiety and fear comes from feeling like all of this consensus &quot;reality&quot; is one infinitely looping fractal pattern out of one&#39;s control and feeling disassociated from ones incarnation aka avatar (human existence) on earth and it not feeling real but a projection/thought.
Others also seem unreal as the physical mind falsely perceives the Oneness meaning my consciousness is the only authentic and co-creating one and everything else is &quot;fake&quot;.
I wouldn&#39;t wish this existential terror on those we think are the worst of us on Earth. 
I do believe we are all One, but the human mind cannot integrate this in real time which causes this DP/DR.
I do think this is a possible reason we invented morality and religion.  To try to be more magnanimous to each other as an effort to live the Oneness in our daily lives.  Unfortunately, this original human effort (religion) has been corrupted and now resides solely with ego driven petty aspects of the Self. </p>

I&#39;m not here to crusade for anyone, neither for nor against reddit.<br/>
To me this site is a path towards connection with people.
I&#39;ve lived long enough on the fringes of society the past 12 years as an over the road trucker that I have very few real world friends and even those are people that I either worked for or with at some point.
I joined a little over a year ago and the site was already fucked by then.  I had no say in it.   Now people throw around the word &quot;shill&quot; like it&#39;s no big deal.
I have no interest in proving or disproving anything.  I&#39;m honestly expressing myself and what I see happening in reality from my perspective.  That&#39;s all one can expect of anyone.
Divide and conquer, problem-reaction-solution, shill this, shill that, it&#39;s all being used to control the narrative in every form of media including reddit.  One should expect this given the globalist predicament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my entire psychedelic history:</p>

<ul>
<li> one does of 3.5 dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms alone.</li>
<li> roughly 2 years later, another psilocybin mushroom trip with 7 grams each with my wife.</li>
<li> Dec/2015 approx. another 2 years later, the worst/best trip ever all in one.  extraction of 1500 Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds total (took 750 each with my wife)</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<ul>
<li> A fellow redditors comment about Salvia made me remember that I did in fact take that on two occasions and each was smoking a bowl of 80x extract.  I really don&#39;t consider it a &quot;psychedelic&quot; experience for me personally because each time I had no conscious recollection of what happened during the trip although I filmed myself and was apparently enjoying myself.  All I remember is the comedown which had unpleasant &quot;return to body&quot; effects that caused me anxiety for 3 hours after the trip.</li>
</ul>

<p>So no DMT.  Not for a lack of trying, but as an over the road trucker between 12/2004 and 12/2015 I never had a real life and no real friends in Metro Detroit where I live.
I originally heard of DMT from Joe Rogan (of course I did).
Which led me to read (well actually listen on audible) Rick Strassman&#39;s book &quot;DMT:  The Spirit Molecule&quot; and other books like &quot;Supernatural&quot; by Graham Hancock and I watched the DMT documentary on Netflix.
I was fascinated with DMT for a long time but could never manifest it in my reality so to speak.  And I never wanted to risk ordering from the internet as I value my &quot;freedom&quot; in the open air consumer zoo versus prison.
I wish I did that instead of LSA, I&#39;d probably be just fine now since DMT doesn&#39;t alter one&#39;s own sense of self from what I&#39;ve read.
Do You mind sharing Your most profound insights into reality and the human condition from Your consciousness traveling using DMT?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s awesome that you read &quot;Supernatural&quot; by Hancock! It&#39;s one of the books I recommend most on this subject; I think he does a great job showing the likely reality of shamanism for an empirical perspective. The other really fantastic one is &quot;The Cosmic Serpent&quot; by Jeremy Narby.</p>

<p>For anyone not familiar with this subject, here&#39;s the documentary he referred to, &quot;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&quot;
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m actually currently in the early stages of working on a web site with another redditor about the DMT phenomenon! I have hundreds of trip stories collected and some stuff written. It&#39;s really difficult to reach a lot of people about it, as you can imagine, since people are very wedded to materialism, which they tend to view as the only alternative to organized religion, with total ignorance of shamanism. I&#39;m happy to share the trip stories with anyone interested- PM me- but I don&#39;t want to clog up this sub.</p>

<p>The short version for me is that I&#39;ve 100% encounter non-human, &quot;alien&quot; intelligence, sentient forces way too powerful to put into words. As far as a real breakthrough, the realism and power of it, whatever your expectations are, multiply them by about a thousand. I mean, it&#39;s absolutely unbelievable. Life matters, death isn&#39;t absolute, there&#39;s something else going on here. For me I&#39;ve tried to take the ball and run with it, because the place DMT shows us is real, and I&#39;ve been working for years on accessing it (at least somewhat) just through meditation, without DMT. And I can get in there, especially with a little weed. There&#39;s a separate universe tucked in our minds, perhaps embedded in our billions of miles of DNA in our bodies that scientists don&#39;t know the function of. There seems to be an interconnected web of intelligence that must exist at the atomic or sub-atomic level. If you look it&#39;s not hard to find it, but people are aught up in addictions to substances that tend to block these experiences, like alcohol, coffee and cigarettes. Put that stuff aside, though, and work with DMT in particular, and you find the most extraordinary worlds behind your closed eyelids, filled with intelligence and all sorts of beings or entities.</p>

As an observer with no actual experience of DMT, I can only go by what people report.  Based on people&#39;s reports, it seems to me that DMT allows the non-local &quot;consciousness/soul&quot; of the individual to untether from the limitations of the body and actually travel into space/time and other dimensions.
It seems like a vehicle for consciousness travel.  In Your experience, do You think this assessment is sound?  Are You able to direct the experience through concentrated focus of will or other methods like affirmations or chanting mantras?
The DMT phenomenon is the single most mysterious subject that I&#39;ve ever encountered other than DP/DR which causes people to trip without drugs and perceive consensus reality as an artificial matrix and/or dream.</p>

I don&#39;t really consider it a traditional psychedelic because I filmed myself while I was on it and I can&#39;t consciously remember anything from the experience, only the horrible physical side effects during the comedown that takes over 3 hours.
I only tried Salvia twice and each time it was smoking a full bowl of 80x Salvia &quot;extract&quot; (i don&#39;t remember what it was called).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did too much man. There&#39;s like 6 stages to a salvia high. If you can&#39;t remember what happened, you hit stage 6 which is just too much.</p>

<p>S - SUBTLE effects, Relaxation and increased sensual appreciation may be noted. This mild level is useful for meditation and may facilitate sexual pleasure.</p>

<p>A - ALTERED perception, colors and textures are paid attention to. Thinking becomes less logical, and more playful.</p>

<p>L - LIGHT visionary state. Closed eye visuals (clear imagery with eyes closed).</p>

<p>V - VIVID visionary state. Complex three dimensional realistic appearing scenes occur. With eyes closed you experience fantasies. So long as your eyes are closed you may believe they are really occurring.</p>

<p>I - IMMATERIAL existence. Individuality may be lost; one experiences merging with the Divine.</p>

<p>A - AMNESIC effects. Loss of consciousness. The individual may fall, or remain immobile or thrash around. Dangerous!</p>

<p>Aim for stage V and I.</p>

<p>There are still many people out there who have no idea that shilling is openly admitted to, even on Reddit. If most people don&#39;t know that something is an advertisement or propaganda, their guard will be down. This is not like a commercial on television where you have a healthy skepticism of the claims made because you know the content is sponsored. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just so everyone knows, it looks like one of the mods here removed this post for a while and then approved it. <a href="http://imgur.com/Tj1pDgU">http://imgur.com/Tj1pDgU</a></p>

<p>It was removed for an hour and 25 minutes, meaning it received no upvotes for that time and thus was given a severe handicap on Reddit&#39;s ranking system. It&#39;s no surprise this post is now number 2 in this sub, blocking 80 or 90 percent of the subscribers from seeing it. </p>

<p>Edit2: The mods claim they are not responsible for the removal. </p>

<p>I lived in New Hampshire for a while, so I got to see a lot of Bernie&#39;s work in nearby Vermont and he really impressed me with his ethics and intelligence.  I&#39;ll take whoever pops up on the Dem ticket, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>someone who doesn&#39;t have the same opinion as you do about something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that when examining the facts, you realize that her entire history in politics seems to revolve around shady dealings.</p>

<p>I think people should form their own opinions about things, but when the information they are basing that on is wrong or slanted, your opinions are being manipulated by those who hold power. That&#39;s not to say that Reddit/Bernie don&#39;t try to distort the truth for their own means, but the coverage from the MSM should tell you everything you need to know about who&#39;s really a threat to the status quo. Maybe you&#39;re the type of person who wants more of the same, but one would hope the recent revelations of the Panama Papers would make someone reconsider this notion. </p>

<p>The most powerful tool the media has is to <em>not</em> talk about something- even bad press is still good press these days. I mean people can act like Trump/Hillary having all these negative stories about them almost every day pushes voters away, but in reality they&#39;re hearing their names, they&#39;re forming opinions about these people, whereas if you don&#39;t talk about someone, then they&#39;re not going to seek out to know more about them. More importantly they&#39;re distracting us from talking about the real issues. I mean seriously, abortion? Gay rights? Not to downplay their importance, but these are issues of the 90&#39;s that we are literally going back in time to talk about, and have no real bearing today on the direction our country is going. We have presidential candidates who believe climate change is a hoax, that is patently ridiculous.</p>

<p>You see it all the time with these stations, like something <em>extremely</em> important happening in political dealings abroad, i.e., the TPP, and the media seems to literally go out of it&#39;s way to talk about <em>anything but</em> the thing that is most pressing to the realities of our situations. So while yes, I think people should form their own opinions about things, and yes Reddit can be an echo chamber for Bernie supporters- but when you see this history keep repeating yourself and finally hear someone who says &quot;hey, no, this is bullshit&quot; it&#39;s hard not to support them, even if you don&#39;t necessarily agree with all of their policies. A lot of what we saw with the Ron Paul campaign back in the day has been happening to Bernie; i.e., a lack of media coverage/bias of media against his campaign, strange circumstances that prevented him from sharing his message or measures in place to prevent potential voters of his from being properly represented.. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to go off on such a tangent, and I don&#39;t mean to make assumptions about you as a person, but I&#39;m tired of people just accepting that choosing the President should be picking between &#39;the lesser of two shit-heads&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had a basic understanding of market economics you would realize this isn&#39;t going to be a vote for the lesser of 2 shitheads it is already a vote for the lesser of 4 idiots.</p>

<p>Also, Bernie is getting at a minimum 20x the coverage Ron Paul ever had and clearly is getting enough coverage for people to vote for his giveaway packages in the primaries. Unlike Ron Paul who ran on principle, Bernie runs on a very simple platform &quot;I will give you stuff and take the money to pay for it from the rich.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if those businesses which are to be taxed more had been paying a livable wage to begin with, didn&#39;t take government subsidies, while getting tax breaks and stashing profits off-shore we wouldn&#39;t need to take the money from those who got their large sums of money through likely nefarious means. Whether you like it or not the government needs money to keep society running, and decimating the middle class while allowing the corporate plutocracy take over is <em>not</em> the way to solve our problems. </p>

I abhor what Trump stands for, and Cruz is going to bring WWIII, but Hillary will solidify the oligarchy&#39;s rule.  So bern it up with Bernie Sanders or burn it down with Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The_Donald is more of an example of this to me, than Hillary&#39;s sub. When your subs stance is to immediately censor any dissenting opinion about Trump, and inundate <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> with shitposts, it drowns out the other opinions. A few months ago, viewing reddit by all by the hour was a good way to see which posts would hit the front page, but since The_Donald, the amount of upvotes you see on posts by the hour is substantially lower because of the amount of posts by this sub which drown out the rest of posts being made. </p>

<p>Seriously, if you were to go back a few months and compare the number of  comments on new posts from other more legitimate subs with the number that we&#39;re seeing today and I think you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s substantially lower. A lot of what&#39;s on the front page are posts that have been vote fudged by the admins to make it seem that Reddit isn&#39;t in a very strange place right now. What we&#39;re seeing is an infiltration by the corporate infrastructure with troll accounts that exist for the very purpose of distracting and dividing Reddit&#39;s collective userbase. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html">Here&#39;s</a> an article detailing how this happens in other countries. Reddit and Facebook are almost certainly engaged in this in our current election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what gets to me. Everyone has  had a political opinion and a favorite candidate, but there&#39;s always a realization that others have a different opinion. Sometimes this leads to arguments and anger between both sides, but I&#39;ve never seen something quite like the Bernie supporters on this site. </p>

<p>Listen, I&#39;m a republican supporter in most cases, and I realize that for the past 8 years, I was in the minority and America decided we should have a Dem in office. Great, I&#39;m not happy about it, but I accept defeat and continue on. With Bernie supporters, it&#39;s like they fail to realize they are stating an opinion and not everyone agrees with them. Everything they say is a fact, and the only reason he&#39;s unable to get votes from his own party is a conspiracy. Not because there&#39;s true Hilary supporters out there, not because everyone doesn&#39;t agree that his policies are a good idea. Every time they see a Hillary supporter, it&#39;s a $hill. Every time he loses a state, it&#39;s because there&#39;s a conspiracy to hide his message and turn away his voters. Like, seriously, just chill out and accept the fact that not everyone agrees with you. </p>

<p>All of these candidates and all presidents have supported and enacted socialist programs. Therefore they&#39;re socialist right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know there are arguments that FDR made the depression worse for poor people with the New Deal, right? And that WWII led to richest, most badass country, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet after all this, the grand promise of an end to the suffering was never fulfilled. As the state sector drained the private sector, controlling it in alarming detail, the economy continued to wallow in depression. The combined impact of Herbert Hoover&#39;s and Roosevelt&#39;s interventions meant that the market was never allowed to correct itself. Far from having gotten us out of the Depression, FDR prolonged and deepened it, and brought unnecessary suffering to millions.</p>

<p>Even more tragic is the lasting legacy of Roosevelt. The commitment of both masses and elites to individualism, free markets, and limited government suffered a blow in the 1930s from which it has yet to recover fully. The theory of the mixed economy is still the dominant ideology backing government policy. In place of old beliefs about liberty, we have greater toleration of, and even positive demand for, collectivist schemes that promise social security, protection from the rigors of market competition, and something for nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s awesome that you read &quot;Supernatural&quot; by Hancock! It&#39;s one of the books I recommend most on this subject; I think he does a great job showing the likely reality of shamanism for an empirical perspective. The other really fantastic one is &quot;The Cosmic Serpent&quot; by Jeremy Narby.</p>

<p>For anyone not familiar with this subject, here&#39;s the documentary he referred to, &quot;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&quot;
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m actually currently in the early stages of working on a web site with another redditor about the DMT phenomenon! I have hundreds of trip stories collected and some stuff written. It&#39;s really difficult to reach a lot of people about it, as you can imagine, since people are very wedded to materialism, which they tend to view as the only alternative to organized religion, with total ignorance of shamanism. I&#39;m happy to share the trip stories with anyone interested- PM me- but I don&#39;t want to clog up this sub.</p>

<p>The short version for me is that I&#39;ve 100% encounter non-human, &quot;alien&quot; intelligence, sentient forces way too powerful to put into words. As far as a real breakthrough, the realism and power of it, whatever your expectations are, multiply them by about a thousand. I mean, it&#39;s absolutely unbelievable. Life matters, death isn&#39;t absolute, there&#39;s something else going on here. For me I&#39;ve tried to take the ball and run with it, because the place DMT shows us is real, and I&#39;ve been working for years on accessing it (at least somewhat) just through meditation, without DMT. And I can get in there, especially with a little weed. There&#39;s a separate universe tucked in our minds, perhaps embedded in our billions of miles of DNA in our bodies that scientists don&#39;t know the function of. There seems to be an interconnected web of intelligence that must exist at the atomic or sub-atomic level. If you look it&#39;s not hard to find it, but people are aught up in addictions to substances that tend to block these experiences, like alcohol, coffee and cigarettes. Put that stuff aside, though, and work with DMT in particular, and you find the most extraordinary worlds behind your closed eyelids, filled with intelligence and all sorts of beings or entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s clarify something. Psilocybin is a tool, much like a hammer, a screwdriver, or some nails. If you hold the hammer in your hand with a few nails in your pocket, and take no action, nothing will get built. You have to put in some work too. Eating drugs, or combinations thereof, WILL NOT cause spiritual awakening in and of themselves. The drugs are a conduit for self-driven experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right.  It takes actual work to achieve the goal.
The work of reading, contemplating, meditating, living, experiencing, choosing, doing,  failing, suffering, understanding, adjusting, removing self-imposed limitations and learning to create and manifest desirable experiences for Self and Others.
There&#39;s a lot of work to be done, drugs are merely tools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, a freight broker.  It makes sense now that You&#39;re a person with zero compassion for others.
Please don&#39;t drag me into a pointless exercise of will and facts which You would lose as I have unlimited time to eviscerate ignorance with knowledge and wisdom.<br/>
Over my 12 year driving career I&#39;ve talked to many &quot;brokers&quot; and they&#39;re professional liars by default.
I&#39;ve pulled loads that the broker gets paid $12,000 for sitting on his ass answering phones and only pays the owner operator $2000 who has to drive a heavy load across mountains with snow and ice.  Meanwhile it is truckers who do %99 of the work and suffer a shortened life span (17 years) by virtue of just living this lifestyle (stress, shitty food, not enough time off etc.) let alone never have a real home life, family and friends.
18 hour days is normal if You want to turn miles.  Old School truck drivers do not run Regs because they can&#39;t afford to.
The only reason the DOT was created was to force the wholesale creation of massive monopolies.
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/28/trucking-used-to-be-a-ticket-to-the-middle-class-now-its-just-another-low-wage-job/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/28/trucking-used-to-be-a-ticket-to-the-middle-class-now-its-just-another-low-wage-job/</a></p>

<p>Owner operators went from making doctor level income before deregulation to barely making ends meet and running 10 to 11 months out of the year.
When operating costs are over $1.00/mile yet brokers want to pay $1.3 to $1.5 per mile when company drivers make minimum $0.40/mile You come here claiming good money? You&#39;re delusional or a liar.
Minimum freight charge for dry van should be $2.50 and we still wouldn&#39;t be where it was in 1980 if adjusted to inflation which would be $3.60 today.
Brokers are the reason this industry sucks and truckers aren&#39;t making any money.  You&#39;ve directly profited from the corporate fascist policies of deregulation and the suffering of others.  Trucking is the worst job in this country and the only industry i know of without a minimum wage.
Try going over the road for 11 months out of the year and come come broke and tell me this industry is awesome.  Please, this is just me venting a fraction of my capacity. 
Why are You even in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  I think <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a> might be better for someone of Your character and nature.</p>
