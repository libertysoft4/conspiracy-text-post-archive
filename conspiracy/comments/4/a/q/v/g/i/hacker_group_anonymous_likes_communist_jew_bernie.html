<p>I am also speaking generally, though. You are so quick to attack people and often don&#39;t back up your claims or attacks on the claims of others with actual evidence, preferring personal insults. That seems to be a common theme by regulars here towards natural conspiracy skeptics.</p>

<p>My post was not purposely misleading or dishonest and I didn&#39;t tell any lies or commit slander. Talk about overstating things.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting question, but it&#39;s not relevant to the fact that Bernie Sanders is a reliable Zionist/pro-AIPAC vote and that Sanders has spent his entire, decades long career as a Washington insider funneling the tax money of working class Americans to the rather wealthy Zionist entity.</p>

<p>No wonder Sanders wants to raise taxes - that way, he can send even <em>more</em> of American&#39;s tax money to the foreign state of Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said before, Bernie Sanders is certainly <em>for</em> sending the tax money of working class Americans to Israel.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is also the Senator that sabotaged the Audit the Fed bill, thereby protecting Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, and the wealthiest 1%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump and Clinton are both just as bad as Sanders when it comes to the Israel lobby - yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Sanders has proven - by his record - that he has zero interest in taking on the Israel lobby, nor doing anything substantive for the working class. Sure, he wants to raise taxes - so he can send more money to Israel.</p>

<p>Sanders and Clinton are both for disenfranchising the working class with mass immigration of cheap labor. At least Trump is against that. Plus, Trump and Sanders are far better than Clinton on trade deals.</p>

<p>But Sanders&#39; bad qualities far outweigh his good qualities (the few that there are) and it&#39;s all irrelevant because he isn&#39;t going to win, he&#39;s going to drop out and endorse Hillary, because that is the kind of conventional, political shill that Bernie Sanders actually is.</p>

<p>Maybe if you were an American informed about American politics you would know that.</p>

I actually wonder if he&#39;s been given the nod to hang on rather than drop out as the FBI are eroding Hillary&#39;s trust level slowly but surely and just might get something to stick to the teflon bitch. I still think Trump would probably win ultimately though as he&#39;s the one saying what most people really want to hear. </p>

<p>I view Socialism as the step to Communism about the same way as I view marijuana as the step to heroin. The statement has some merit especially ideologically, but in reality rarely leads to the feared outcome, and is primarily used now as a rhetorical device. No one would say marijuana is heroin, and people shouldn&#39;t interchange socialist and communist, it is misleading.</p>

<p>Tax the rich, attack the fed constantly, raise wages, free public school, free healthcare -= an attempt to finally help people have a basic standard of living</p>

<p>Both had anti imperialist policies.</p>

<p>Why is Bernie so opposite of Ron?? Where do u get this from? Honest guys who never wavered from their POV, that want to help the people...</p>

<p>What are you not seeing? Bernie is so far from some evil corporate freak, you guys are killing yourselves. You hate the poor so much that you have become anti left no matter what? Is that it ?? Wtf?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie calls himself a &quot;Socialist,&quot; he praised the Communist regime in Cuba, the Communist regime in Nicaragua (the Bernie Bros call themselves &quot;Sandernistas&quot;) and he honeymooned in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders calls HIMSELF a &quot;Jew&quot; and said his identification was important to him. He has also spent his entire decades long career as a Washington insider funneling the tax money of working class Americans to the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine and has a virtually 100% pro-Israel voting record.</p>

<p>So - what are you complaining about? &quot;Communist Jew&quot; is an accurate description of Bernie Sanders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A genuine, honest, human being who&#39;s been talking about the disenfranchised WORKING CLASS, for 30 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s NOT honest, he&#39;s NOT genuine, and all he has done is TALK - at least when it comes to working class Americans.</p>

<p>When it comes to wealthy foreign Israelis, Sanders has actually delivered for them.</p>

<p>What is sickening is you trying to purposefully deceive people about Bernie Sanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He went against Israel more then any other politician you are a liar. Praising a leaders policies, HONEYMOONING SOMEWHERE, and having supporters call make a funny name out of a old freedom fighting group is somehow evil and a secret tell for how he is bad? You clowns are really messed up in the head. It&#39;s sad, even the &quot;awake&quot; types just can&#39;t figure it out... You just don&#39;t get it.. Idk if it&#39;s that you haven&#39;t been in the street, or in a poor area, or in a workplace, or generally experienced life.. So you sit home and act conspiratorial and fuck yourself over by attacking the only Jew who isn&#39;t owned by Israel? And you STILL don&#39;t know what communism is? WTF?? The Cold War propaganda STILL HAS YOU BRAINWASHED HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE. M O R O N forreal.   Show me anywhere, literally anywhere, one second of footage that shows Bernie as a stooge for the eiite, or special interests, or any controlling entity.. PLEASE.   Otherwise FOH because your ruining this for all of us.  You are the type who would have called OCCUPY WALL ST communist If a real revolution would have taken place.</p>

<p>Everyone wants revolution.. When movements spring up, when a honest leader comes around, you commit counter revolutionary acts. If you were Cuban you would have fled and been a wannabe capitalist.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because you have no heart, AND no brain. </p>

<p>What has to happen for you guys to man up and fix your communities? Trump? Hyper conservative rule? What!? What do you want from life? Fear? Hate? War? Starvation wages? Rape prices for school? Rape prices for hospitals? Multinational corporation rule??</p>

<p>You realize that it was people like you and Putin loves cats that acted as pawns or the ruling elite to fight back against all positive change right? </p>

<p>What is communism? Feeding your family?  Affordable education? Being healthy? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU DEVILS WANT. HOLY FUCK I WANT TO JUST BREAK DOWN IN TEARS WHEN I SEE PEOPLE LIKE YOU. DONT YOU GET IT????! WE AEE DYING IN THIS ECONOMIC WARZONE. CHILDREN ARE BEING RIPPED APART OVERSEAS. WE ARE FUCKING STARVING. PLEASE GOD PLEASE WAKE UP AND HELP YOUR GODDAMN COMMUNITY PLEASE. </p>

<p>WE CANT DO IT WITHOUT YOU. YOU CANT BE ADVERSARIAL TO ALL POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL ORDER. ITS THE POOR VS THE RICH. YOU ARE WORKING FOR THE RICH.. HOW CAN YOU BE SO MORALLY BANKRUPT AND BRAINWASHED BY ANTI FREEDOM PROPAGANDA. IF YOU WORK 40 HOURS YOU DESERVE A BASIC STANDARD OF LIVING PLEASE DONT TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THE KIDS IN THE STREET WHO ARE FIGHTING THE HI TECH RIOT COPS THAT YOU ACT AS AN AGENT FOR.</p>

<p>WAKE UP PLEASE. THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO THE &quot;conspiracy&quot;. WORLD.. AND ITS IN THE STREETS. JOIN IT OR BE A FASCIST FREAKSHOW THAT SCREAMS COMMUNISM WHEN PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY </p>
