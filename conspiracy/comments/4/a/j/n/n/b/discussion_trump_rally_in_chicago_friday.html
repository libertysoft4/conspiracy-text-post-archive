        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Just as Trump and his supporters have the right to assemble and speak, his opponents likewise have the right to peaceably protest.  They do not have the right to overrun Trump’s rallies, nor to silence opposition.  This is an important point.  The rights we enjoy in this nation are not enjoyed the world over.  We have the opportunity to speak and debate and engage in the free flow of ideas.  This is the very foundation of the civil society.  The first step toward tyranny is to remove that ability.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This ideology says, “If I don’t like what you have to say, it’s perfectly justifiable to shut you down.”  Of what else is such an ideology capable?  History gives us the answer, and it’s deeply troubling.  To be sure, it’s a long road from point A to point Z, but for those to whom the end justifies the means, it’s a smooth, straight road.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking a sub full of progressive liberals of their own actions are justified?  Good luck with that.  They claim to be open minded and impartial, but they&#39;re just as bad if not worse than those on their &quot;other side&quot;.  Too blind to see it, or they do but don&#39;t care.  They&#39;re authoritarian fascists, but believe themselves to be on the &quot;right side&quot;; they&#39;re the &quot;good guys&quot; and everyone with a different opinion is evil.  They will stick their heads in the sand or run away rather than entertain any cognitive dissonance.  Pathetic, really.</p>

<p>Again, you need to describe where the right of assembly comes from, whose rights it protects, and who it protects those rights from.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t established that anyone&#39;s rights were actually violated. When you do, I&#39;ll be willing to carry the discussion further.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really struggling here to help you with your willful ignorance problem. Do the research. Go learn for yourself the answers to those two questions about the protections. When you do, you might re-word your question or even change your position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. </p>

<p>You are a condescending fuck that thinks you are much smarter than you are. </p>

<p>You have made no points of value on this thread. Your justification whatever your political candidate of choice does demonstrates your lack of awareness as you believe in the false left/right paradigm. In short, your &#39;dumbassery&#39; has been on display since your first reply and was easily brought out. </p>

<p>There is still time to take your head out of your ass. But you won&#39;t take it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very familiar with the text. I know exactly what it means, to whom it offers its protections, and from whom it offers its protections.</p>

<p>But you have admitted you do not, so how can you use that as the source of the protection of the right to peaceably assemble?</p>

<p>I&#39;m really struggling here to help you with your willful ignorance problem. Do the research. Go learn for yourself the answers to those two questions about the protections. When you do, you might re-word your question or even change your position.</p>
