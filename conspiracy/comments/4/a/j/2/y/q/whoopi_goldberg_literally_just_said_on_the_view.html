<p>No. It&#39;s history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox News wasn&#39;t even around 25 years ago. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. Fox didn&#39;t join the effort until 1996. But Hillary has been dogged by constant smears and lies from the right since setting foot on the national stage in 1991. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current onslaught of never ending bullshit really didn&#39;t get super ramped up until Sept 11 2001. </p>

<p>I have no idea what you are referring to here. But you might want to familiarize yourself with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hunting-President-Ten-Year-Campaign/dp/0312273193">the actual history</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hillary sucks, that&#39;s why people don&#39;t like her. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m curious: What exactly do you base this on? The opinions you hear from your brethren on the far-right? 
Because you could not be more wrong if you tried.
Sure, conservatives, wingnuts, lunatics, and psychopaths don&#39;t like Hillary. But she&#39;s been the front-runner to win the presidency since the campaign started in early 2015. She remains the favorite to beat Trump. And she has received more popular votes than Trump and every other candidate in the primaries so far. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She&#39;s a bad politician, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll grant you she&#39;s not a very good campaigner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>either a murderer </p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL. I see you&#39;ve been drinking the wingnut / lunatic Kool Aide. Tasty, isn&#39;t it!?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She laughed about the murder of Gaddafi. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gaddafi may have had some nice policies, but he was also a brutal butcher, tyrant, despot, and dictator -- an authoritarian strongman. In other words, just the kind of person I would expect a conservative to root for. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Libya had a higher standard of living than Japan or Brazil, and the highest in all of Africa, what a terrible regime. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What has happened in Libya is tragic, but don&#39;t pretend it was a peaceful paradise until Hillary showed up. The country was in an active state of revolution, and Gaddafi was going around the country killing civilians en masse. The US didn&#39;t do anything to help, but the disaster was well underway before we intervened to prevent some of the killing by Gaddafi. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious: what do you think happened at Benghazi? What are your sources for information about this? I&#39;m especially interested because you renounced the GOP. Does that mean you also renounce the GOP talking points and sources on Benghazi? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the collective effect of &quot;blow back&quot;.</p>

<p>I said nothing about blow back, but the reason I was one of the few Americans opposing the Iraq invasion in 2002 and 2003 is because it was obvious that the invasion would be a disaster and lead to dramatic blowback harming America. Just like previous foreign policy blunders led to 9/11.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious: Have you voted for Republicans in the past? And who are you voting for if not Republicans? It sounds like you hate Democrats, too. </p>

<p>Basically none. I think you could justify US intervention for humanitarian purposes - like, to stop a genocide. And you could justify some US intervention if it TRULY was necessary for US security. But 95% of US foreign policy over the last 60 years cannot be justified and has been disastrous for the US and the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you don&#39;t acknowledge reality when it comes to the 25 year campaign by the right to smear Hillary, there is a separate question about what Whoopi Goldberg meant. And what she meant was that Hillary has proven for almost 3 decades her resilience in the face of non-stop lies and attacks from the right wing smear machine. Which is of course impossible to dispute. Anyone with even slight familiarity with the history since 1991 could witness the history with their own eyes. The GOP and all it&#39;s appendages have been coming after Hillary for 25 years and they have never been able to lay a single finger on her. Every effort to smear her and destroy her has failed. No matter how concentrated the effort, no matter how many lies, she just keeps on surviving -- because there is no basis to the lies at all.</p>

<p>The information was classified years afterwards. It wasn&#39;t classified when it was sent to her. At least not the vast majority of what was eventually deemed classified. Furthermore, she was only doing what the previous 3 Secs of State did. Her 3 Republican predecessors all say this is a non-story. It&#39;s  a non-story. It&#39;s a story that Fox News and the wingnut hoarde of the GOP are pushing because they will pick up any cudgel they can find to swing at her, whether it has merit or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The regans did so much good&quot; </p>

<p>It was a dumb comment, she was trying to be gracious in recalling the life of someone who had just died. She was trying to be respectful. And said something stupid. I can live with it. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s telling her followers to phyically attack people who disagree with her. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s offering ethnic cleansing as a national policy. It&#39;s not like she wants to ban Muslims from entering the country. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s offering to commit massive war crimes. In other words, compared to Trump, it&#39;s pretty funny the best you have is she said something nice about Nancy Reagan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look don&#39;t get me wrong Fox news is beating to death the Email thing. Now the reason for this &quot;scandal&quot; is Clinton had a private server set up in her home allowing her to do some work in a home office which is odd when you think about it. Now the last 3 Secretary of States: Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright. From what we know about their communication habits Albrights and Rice didn&#39;t use much emails because there are other ways to communicate. Now for Powell the reason he doesn&#39;t have any person emails is because he didn&#39;t use a personal sever to communicate. Clinton acted before she stopped to think of she could or should it seems to be a habit with her. Clinton is being mentioned in the same breath as Stephen Kim and David Petraeus.  For what its worth not only Fox news it&#39;s taking about it, so is the BBC and Washington post.</p>

<p>Do you think my dislike of Clinton is proof of my Trump support well big surprise I don&#39;t like Trump either he does and says more obscure things than Hillary or Sanders combined. The fact that she watered down the Regans involvement, or lack there of, in AIDs epedimic is laughable. Not only did they ignore it but then they retroactively created legislation banning homosexuals from donating blood which means even today if i get leukima and need a blood transfer my brother who would be a match can&#39;t donate to me. Clinton tied to rewrite history whether on purpose or accident i don&#39;t know either way she&#39;s a ignorant twit i hate that bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Negative fucking 35...37</p>

<p>Read the comment from the perspective of someone that wants to support Hillary because of what is mentioned in the comment.</p>

<p>The GOP, Fox, etc. only exist to smear &quot;any high profile Democrat.&quot; No other reason. Some are caught up in the campaign, and are successfully marginalized...</p>

<p>&quot;But not muh Hirrary!&quot; She&#39;s been able to endure the smear campaigns and lies of the GOP machine. She is the blade of grass that breaks the GOP lawnmower.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the perception of her, something I do not have. I see her as a career criminal that is always looking for new leverage, and new money. BUT, UncriticalEye gave us a glimpse into what the opposition believes about Hillary.</p>

<p>Why is he/she/attackhelicopter being downvoted for such an enlightening statement?</p>

<p>Despite countless GOP investigations and millions of wasted taxpayer dollars that have never produced a single shred of evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. You believe she&#39;s a criminal because your &quot;ideas&quot; consist of what has been repeated shit into your skull by Rush Limbaugh and his peers over the past decades. If you could think for yourself, you might wonder why there isn&#39;t any, you know, evidence that she is a criminal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I look at her involvement in Watergate, on, and decided that she is a criminal. Vince Foster is one good example, but also the acts committed by her husband while he was Governor, leave quite a few unanswered questions.</p>

<p>I can, so you&#39;re taking this all too personally. You attack those that try to defend your opinion, so maybe your negative karma is well deserved.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I suppose you mean White Water. So, you &quot;decided she is a criminal&quot; after you &quot;looked at her involvement in&quot; White Water, even though she was never found guilty of anything. How can you justify calling her a criminal when she was totally exonerated by several massive Republican-led investigations that dragged on for years?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vince Foster is one good example</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vince Foster is an example of how Republicans will literally accuse the Clintons of <em>anything.</em> Again, this was investigated extensively. No one who knows anything about it believes Hillary had Foster killed. This is just more BS made up by the Republican smear machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think people that have &quot;a favorite&quot; candidate tend to not want to know or believe the worse; which IMO is a bit naive. i <em>would</em> want to know as much as possible as no one is perfect, but to think that any U.S. politician is without <em>dirt in their closet</em> is just scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is this sarcasm? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. It&#39;s history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox News wasn&#39;t even around 25 years ago. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. Fox didn&#39;t join the effort until 1996. But Hillary has been dogged by constant smears and lies from the right since setting foot on the national stage in 1991. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current onslaught of never ending bullshit really didn&#39;t get super ramped up until Sept 11 2001. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what you are referring to here. But you might want to familiarize yourself with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hunting-President-Ten-Year-Campaign/dp/0312273193">the actual history</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hillary sucks, that&#39;s why people don&#39;t like her. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m curious: What exactly do you base this on? The opinions you hear from your brethren on the far-right? 
Because you could not be more wrong if you tried.
Sure, conservatives, wingnuts, lunatics, and psychopaths don&#39;t like Hillary. But she&#39;s been the front-runner to win the presidency since the campaign started in early 2015. She remains the favorite to beat Trump. And she has received more popular votes than Trump and every other candidate in the primaries so far. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She&#39;s a bad politician, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll grant you she&#39;s not a very good campaigner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>either a murderer </p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL. I see you&#39;ve been drinking the wingnut / lunatic Kool Aide. Tasty, isn&#39;t it!?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She laughed about the murder of Gaddafi. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gaddafi may have had some nice policies, but he was also a brutal butcher, tyrant, despot, and dictator -- an authoritarian strongman. In other words, just the kind of person I would expect a conservative to root for. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Libya had a higher standard of living than Japan or Brazil, and the highest in all of Africa, what a terrible regime. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What has happened in Libya is tragic, but don&#39;t pretend it was a peaceful paradise until Hillary showed up. The country was in an active state of revolution, and Gaddafi was going around the country killing civilians en masse. The US didn&#39;t do anything to help, but the disaster was well underway before we intervened to prevent some of the killing by Gaddafi. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are either one smoothly sarcastic poster or someone in need of a closer examination of real history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know the history far better than you do, my friend.</p>
