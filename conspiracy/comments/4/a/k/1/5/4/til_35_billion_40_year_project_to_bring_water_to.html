<p>The Great Manmade River by Muammar Gaddafi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t020rj-QK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t020rj-QK4</a></p>

<p>Say what? Gaddafi !?  I don&#39;t know the facts about Gaddafi&#39;s practices to make an informed decision but it really makes one wonder what other propaganda bullshit and depictions about &quot;them&quot; we&#39;ve been spoonfed.  Why do politicians demonize anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with them and ignore all the good they&#39;ve done?  </p>

<p>When the fuck are we going to grow up and act with some integrity?  Maybe that&#39;s the problem -- we allow our politicians to blatantly lie to us (&quot;Read my lips. No new taxes&quot;) and never hold them accountable.</p>

<p>I see that this is old news to this group ... wow, talk about an eye opener:</p>

<p>folks here don&#39;t get how big a deal Gadafi was to the good of africa and that&#39;s why he was killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its too much to cover but if you want look into Libya what it was like before and after he attacked and look into what the US military is up to in Africa right now especially in regards to drone strikes. 
You should also look into his connection in Kenya as in his family and political influence.
If you have time to spare look into how he&#39;s grown the prison industrial complex in the USA as well and remember he did a good deal of it with the help of Clinton your media and the rest of the sold out system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems rather pessimistic, no?</p>

<p>Change is never easy.</p>

<p>There is a cliche <em>&quot;If it is easy, it probably isn&#39;t worth doing.&quot;</em></p>

<p>It is going to take time to tear down this false dichotomy of &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality.  We need to focus on what we have in common (positive) instead of focusing on our differences (negative).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that this is basically the equivalent of saying that someone destroyed the US Interstate Highway network in a minute?  The pipes are laid out over literally thousands of miles with dozens of reservoirs etc.  It is impossible to even begin to &#39;blow it up&#39; in a minute.  Nice conspiracy.  </p>
