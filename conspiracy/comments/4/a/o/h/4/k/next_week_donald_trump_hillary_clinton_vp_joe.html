    <div class="md"><p>Why are they doing this?</p>

<p>Because they want campaign donations from Jewish donors and they want to avoid bad coverage by the Jewish press.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t Israel, per se. The problem is American Jews, who act as essentially agents of a foreign regime.</p>

<p>Funny, that accusation is considered an &quot;anti-semitic canard&quot; because people have said it a lot. People say it all the time because it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>The solution is MORE Zionism. Jews should move to Israel and leave America for the Americans. We can trade and have diplomatic relations of course, but it&#39;s obvious we need our own countries.</p>

<p>That way everyone is happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>israel owes its entire existence to the West. They are a charity case, just like they always have been. They need America more than ever. Especially with all the enemies they&#39;ve made in the middle-East. There are a lot of gentiles who contribute to their chosen way of life back in America.</p>

<p>Saying they need their own countries is wrong. America needs its own country but if you remove the parasite, it dies. The parasite will do whatever it needs to to survive.</p>

<p>No, it is. Without Israel they don’t have a regime, and thus would actually be beholden to our laws.</p>

<p>Anti-Semitism is nothing but the antagonistic attitude produced in the non-Jews <em>by</em> the Jewish group or individual. This is a <em>normal</em> social reaction.</p>

<p><strong>– Albert Einstein</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shut it down!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am well aware of the tactics you, my Zionist brethren, use to quiet anyone who attempts to expose any of your subversive acts.</p>

<p>If the person is a Gentile, you cry, “You’re anti-semitic!” which is nothing more than a smokescreen to hide your actions. But, if a Jew is the person doing the exposing, you resort to other tactics.</p>

<p>First, you ignore the charges, hoping the information will not be given widespread distribution. If the information starts reaching too many people, you ridicule the information and the persons giving the information. If that doesn&#39;t work, your next step is character assassination. If the author or speaker hasn&#39;t been involved in sufficient scandal you are adept at fabricating scandal against the person or persons. If none of these are effective, you are known to resort to physical attacks. But, NEVER do you try to prove the information wrong.</p>

<p>So, before you start your efforts to quiet me, I offer this challenge:</p>

<p>You Zionists assemble a number of Zionist Jews and witnesses to support your position; and I will assemble a like number of anti-Zionist, pro-American Jews and witnesses. Then, the Zionists and the Anti-Zionists will state their position and debate the material in this book as well as related material — the debate to be held on public television.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s explore the information and let the American people decide for themselves if the information is true or false.</p>

<p>Isn’t that a fair challenge?</p>

<p>Certainly, you will willingly accept the challenge if what I have written is false.</p>

<p>But, if you resort to crying, “Lies, all lies,” and refuse to debate the material you will, in effect, be telling the American people that what I have written are the true facts.</p>

<p><strong>– Jack Bernstein</strong>, <em>The Life of an American Jew in Racist, Marxist Israel</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The goyim know!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this hostility, even aversion, had only been shown towards the Jews at one period and in one country, it would be easy to unravel the limited causes of this anger, but this race has been on the contrary an object of hatred to all the peoples among whom it has established itself. It must be therefore, since the enemies of the Jews belonged to the most diverse races, since they lived in countries very distant from each other, since they were ruled by very different laws, governed by opposite principles, since they had neither the same morals nor the same customs, it must be therefore that the general cause of anti-Semitism has always resided in Israel itself and not in those who have fought against Israel.</p>

<p><strong>– Bernard Lazare</strong>, literary critic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s already chock full of all the Jewish money he needs, as his business network is full of Jewish partners. He even got bailed out by no less than George Soros himself.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s campaign was started by three Jewish Democratic lawyers with ties to the Clintons, let&#39;s not forget.</p>

<p>The latest polls show that Israelis themselves favor Trump over Clinton. And why not? Trump has a Jewish family and Jewish grandchildren living in Israel.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t need any more Zionist support because he&#39;s more of a Zionist than all the other candidates. Trump actually made campaign commercials for Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Trump is going to headline AIPAC and speak of his great love for the foreign state, the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have an old copypasta, since you’re both apparently too lazy to do work on your own and simply accept whatever you’re told by the media.</p>

<p>Trump has done more in half a year to publicly smear the media than anyone else has managed in decades. The media centers–the news aggregators like Fox and MSNBC–are the primary means of controlling the population. If Trump was controlled opposition, he wouldn’t be taking a massive steaming dump on the Jew’s best and primary means of getting what they want in America. The news networks know nobody watches them anymore and the Democrats and Republicans know that nobody wants to vote for either of them anymore. But they need the people to believe otherwise, because that’s how the Emperor’s New Clothes charade is maintained. People who question or attack the parties and the media machine that promotes them are by definition eroding the Zionist control over America. Trump isn’t controlled opposition. Old videos of him show him holding the same general opinions and political leanings that he does now, and he is directly attacking the things that allow Jewish elites to maintain a stranglehold on Washington.</p>

<p>Recall Tolkien’s works. “I think a servant of the Enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.”</p>

<p>If Trump was controlled opposition, he would superficially appear to be a bad goy, but his policies would all serve Jewish and Israeli interests.</p>

<p>The exact opposite of this is true. He superficially appears to be a good goy, but all of his policies are bad for Jews and Israel–or at least, bad for the Jews and Israeli interests who wish to directly control and influence us. He’s not controlled opposition. He’s a Jew-wise bull in a china shop. The worst possible enemy of the establishment. He threatens to break the monopoly of both sides of the aisle. That’s why both parties are attacking him, just like both sides attack the Tea Party because it threatened to wake up the 60% of the US population that doesn’t vote, the vast majority of which are conservatives. Even worse, his mere presence and standing up to the monolithic machine has caused some of the Neocons to start uncucking themselves.</p>

<p>Huckabee has spent the last three decades hiding his power level because he knew it was the only way to get anything done, and now he’s coming out swinging on Trump’s side. We saw something absolutely unprecedented during the GOP debate. We saw the entire Republican lineup shitting on the moderators and their bullshit agenda. That has literally never happened before. And who started the fire? Trump did. Does that sound like a good goy to you? If the GOP wants to snub Trump, they’re going to have an internal struggle to manage it–between the people who had given up hope and become part of the machine and those who were willing accomplices.</p>

<p>And if they do snub him for someone like Bush or Rubio, they’re going to risk not only a political schism that would split the conservative base between the progressives and the traditionalists, but  also further risk an Independent winning the Presidency, which is the one thing that would spell certain doom for both parties.</p>

<p>Because once the people realize an Independent can actually win again, the Emperor’s New Clothes charade is over, the false dichotomy is broken, and the genie can’t ever be put back into the bottle.</p>

<p>WorldNetDaily (lol): <strong><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/02/dump-on-trump-night-debate-means-war-on-gop-kingpin/">TRUMP: AS PRESIDENT, I CAN&#39;T TAKE ISRAEL&#39;S SIDE</a></strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s what the HEADLINE says, but see what <em>THE DONALD</em> <strong><em>actually says</em></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the debate, Blitzer began a round of questions on foreign policy by addressing the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis. <em>He quoted Trump as having previously said, “Let me be sort of a neutral guy. I don’t want to say whose fault it is. I don’t think it helps.”</em></p>

<p>Blitzer then asked Trump, “How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America’s closest ally in the Middle East?”</p>

<p><strong>“Well, first of all I don’t think they do under President Obama, because I think he has treated Israel horribly,” began Trump. “Alright? I think he’s treated Israel horribly.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama treated Israel WHAT??? Now Trump starts with bragging about how Kosher he REALLY is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump added, “I was the <strong>Grand Marshal</strong> down Fifth Avenue a number of years ago for the <strong>Israeli Day parade</strong>. I have <strong>very close ties to Israel</strong>. I’ve <strong>received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.</strong> As president, however, there’s nothing that I would rather do [than] bring peace to Israel and its neighbors.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, <em>THE DONALD</em> is <strong><a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/articles/eatme.09.17.04.gif">Certified Kosher.</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He then insisted, “I think it serves no purpose to say you have a good guy and a bad guy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It’s probably the toughest negotiation of anywhere in the world, of any kind, OK? But, it doesn’t help if I start saying <strong>I’m very pro-Israel, very pro-Israel, more than anybody on this stage. But it doesn’t do any good to start demeaning the neighbors.</strong> Because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.”</p>

<p>Trump said he can’t do that as a negotiator while taking sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, if you believe that <em>THE DONALD</em> is not a Zionist sycophant, you&#39;re willingly deluded. </p>

<p>Sorry. I wish we had at decent candidate running - I really do, but they&#39;ve all bough, sold, repackaged and rebranded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is slandering Trump?  The media is giving Trump free press every single day.  More press than they give anyone.  They cover all of his speeches and rallies as news events so they don&#39;t have to follow equal time rules.  They never force him to answer questions.  He has an open line to Fox and Friends, Morning Joe and Good Morning America where he can call in any day to talk about whatever the hell he wants.  The guy is a media darling.  They WANT Trump to win.  You are out of your mind if you think otherwise.  When the press wants to hurt somebody they simply ignore them.  Look at what they did to Ron Paul in 2012.  They just completely boxed him out.  Whenever he would finish well in a poll or a primary they would ignore it.  None of his rallies were covered and the only time he was given any press was when they wanted to talk about how he is unviable as a candidate.  Trump is on the air morning, noon and night.  He&#39;s not fighting an uphill battle.  He&#39;s being carried.  </p>

<p>This DoubleD dude is obviously one of the many Trump shills that have been trying to brainwash this forum lately. Somehow a billionaire, with ties to the Clintons, endorsements from the Klan, and an advocate for water boarding, is the conspiracy candidate? Please, this is nothing more than propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re all in cahoots together. Trump is a long time personal friend of the Clintons. Trump&#39;s strategy all along has been to poison the well for the GOP, and make unlikeable candidates sound reasonable in comparison. I initially thought he was there to put Hillary against Jeb Bush, but it seems plans have changed slightly.</p>

<p>The media is slandering Trump?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>YEP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media is giving Trump free press every single day. More press than they give anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost as though he’s the most profitable, given that the people love him. Like Ron Paul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They never force him to answer questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure they don’t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They WANT Trump to win. You are out of your mind if you think otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re a complete lunatic. The media is owned by marxists and non-Americans. The last thing their handlers want is Trump, but he’s the best thing for their ratings. He’s saving the fucking country by forcing them to cover him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s not fighting an uphill battle. He’s being carried.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The tide has turned. They know that they’re at the end of their rope, and they know that soon they’ll be hung by that very rope. Physically. There WILL be hangings. There won’t be enough lampposts in Europe or North America. QE3 has failed them. No amount of printing can save them. When the next economic collapse comes–and it will come SOON–they will be forced to accelerate their timetable and play their last card: a global monetary union.</p>

<p>No one will accept this. Europe is already burning and the EU will collapse in a glorious display of freedom. They did too much, too fast, and it will end in their extermination. They’re forced to cover Trump because too many people support him. They know what the public would do if they did not. Silencing him wouldn’t work, because he already uses social media, already has a massive distribution system in his commercial empire, and his initial message was too powerful to ignore. Trump would simply use networks that aren’t the Big Four to get his message out. He has the money to do so, after all. The have to cover him or they lose what little, pathetic ratings they have left. Did you know that MSNBC has less than 20,000 viewers in at least one timeslot? ANEMIC!</p>

<p>All they have left is subversion–it’s all they ever had. If he’s denied the nomination after getting enough delegates, the leaders of the RNC will be killed, end of story. If he’s denied it from voter fraud, this will be uncovered. They’re thinking about throwing Romney into the New York, New Jersey, and California primaries simply to try to steal votes from Trump, but doing that exposes them for the world to see, too. There is no path going forward in which the GOPe survives, other than killing Trump, which only creates a martyr.</p>

<p>The global system–not just American slavery–is collapsing. It’s our task to see to it that it happens as quickly as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so I guess I&#39;ll just quote myself on this one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love how trump supporters are so convinced by his WORDS that he is sincerely in their corner on their side, fighting for them. You know what that sounds like. EVERY politician since I can remember promising things that the &quot;majority&quot; want, once they get elected they accept whatever orders they&#39;re given and push any agenda the Gov&#39;t wants. Remember Obama and his change, his love for transparency.
Just look up any politicians campaigns promises and lets see how many they keep on average. To think that someone whose clearly playing the &quot;political game&quot; by the rules its weird to see so many people convinced the rich guy with no want or needs is totally on the side of the downtrodden and poor. But you may ask &quot;how did we get so downtrodden and poor?&quot; well you have billionaires and politicians to thank for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;But no by all means lets vote in a &quot;billionare&quot; Politician he&#39;ll definitely be the best of both worlds and nor the opposite.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see real reason you think Trump won&#39;t act like Trump. If it barks like a dog, acts like a dog, eats like a dog, then it must be a cat. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get mislead, I (personally) think that all the choices aren&#39;t really choices they&#39;re all different side to the same coin, if you will.

<p>The national debt, internal and external, cannot be settled save by the destruction of the Federal Reserve and the renunciation of all US debt. There is more than a dollar of debt for every dollar in existence. It’s mathematically impossible, and thus the debt itself is irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible doesn&#39;t say that, its the damn zionist preachers preaching lies. The Bible says the man that will sit in that temple is NOT Christ.  The Bible says that all who deny Christ are antichrist. Therefore, the Jews are antichrist. The Bible says <em>Those who deny the son hath not the father.</em> Therefore the Jews don&#39;t have God. Revelation says twice, <em>behold, I will make them of the</em> <strong>synagogue</strong> <em>of satan.</em> Luke 21 says that the true followers of Christ will be brought up to the <strong>synagogues</strong> to be killed. Jesus Christ said to the Jews, <em>if God were your father, you would love me!</em> and they <em>crucified</em> Him. I can show you all the verses about the truth. The Bible exposes the Jews. The Christians that believe otherwise are just deceived by the media and their preachers.. I&#39;m sorry for blowing up your feed, but I don&#39;t want you to believe that zionism has anything to do with Christ or the Bible, because it doesn&#39;t. Please, I want you to know that. It drives me bananas how deceived these people are when they claim to be Christians, but they won&#39;t even pick up a Bible and see what it actually says. Instead they go listen to preachers that are just totally perverting the truth.</p>

<p>You seem to be under the impression that they operate by trying to convince voters to support their &quot;cause&quot;. THEY DON&#39;T.

They don&#39;t pussy-foot around, hoping to get well-meaning but IDIOT (sorry) Evangelical Christians to support them - they are only an insignificantly minor part of their game, which relies on the well-oiled machine built from decades of close in-group cooperation and ethnocentrism to build their wealth, status and power, and to use it, with laser precision, to manipulate and control Western political leaders. </p>

<p>Pound-for-pound, Jews are the wealthiest and most politically powerful people on earth. They work VERY closely with one another to achieve shared goals, and they know exactly where and how to apply pressure to make Western political leaders do their bidding.</p>

<p>It is a science, and they are VERY good at it. </p>

The problem is that our country has a very large number of evangelical Christian voters who believe that the messiah will come once Israel is a 100% Jewish state and they vote accordingly.  They don&#39;t just think that because the Jews told them to.  They think that because their Bible told them so.  Zionist Jews and Christians are peas of the same pod as far as that goes.  Their end game is the same:  make Israel a Jewish state.</p>

<p>You’re a complete lunatic. The media is owned by marxists and non-Americans. The last thing their handlers want is Trump, but he’s the best thing for their ratings. He’s saving the fucking country by forcing them to cover him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s not fighting an uphill battle. He’s being carried.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The tide has turned. They know that they’re at the end of their rope, and they know that soon they’ll be hung by that very rope. Physically. There WILL be hangings. There won’t be enough lampposts in Europe or North America. QE3 has failed them. No amount of printing can save them. When the next economic collapse comes–and it will come SOON–they will be forced to accelerate their timetable and play their last card: a global monetary union.</p>

<p>No one will accept this. Europe is already burning and the EU will collapse in a glorious display of freedom. They did too much, too fast, and it will end in their extermination. They’re forced to cover Trump because too many people support him. They know what the public would do if they did not. Silencing him wouldn’t work, because he already uses social media, already has a massive distribution system in his commercial empire, and his initial message was too powerful to ignore. Trump would simply use networks that aren’t the Big Four to get his message out. He has the money to do so, after all. The have to cover him or they lose what little, pathetic ratings they have left. Did you know that MSNBC has less than 20,000 viewers in at least one timeslot? ANEMIC!</p>

<p>All they have left is subversion–it’s all they ever had. If he’s denied the nomination after getting enough delegates, the leaders of the RNC will be killed, end of story. If he’s denied it from voter fraud, this will be uncovered. They’re thinking about throwing Romney into the New York, New Jersey, and California primaries simply to try to steal votes from Trump, but doing that exposes them for the world to see, too. There is no path going forward in which the GOPe survives, other than killing Trump, which only creates a martyr.</p>

<p>The global system–not just American slavery–is collapsing. It’s our task to see to it that it happens as quickly as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christian zionism is still a <em>huge</em> movement in the US. Look at pastors like John Hagee, and Joel Osteen. Those quacks have thousands of followers, and they both basically preach Christian zionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible doesn&#39;t say that, its the damn zionist preachers preaching lies. The Bible says the man that will sit in that temple is NOT Christ.  The Bible says that all who deny Christ are antichrist. Therefore, the Jews are antichrist. The Bible says <em>Those who deny the son hath not the father.</em> Therefore the Jews don&#39;t have God. Revelation says twice, <em>behold, I will make them of the</em> <strong>synagogue</strong> <em>of satan.</em> Luke 21 says that the true followers of Christ will be brought up to the <strong>synagogues</strong> to be killed. Jesus Christ said to the Jews, <em>if God were your father, you would love me!</em> and they <em>crucified</em> Him. I can show you all the verses about the truth. The Bible exposes the Jews. The Christians that believe otherwise are just deceived by the media and their preachers.. I&#39;m sorry for blowing up your feed, but I don&#39;t want you to believe that zionism has anything to do with Christ or the Bible, because it doesn&#39;t. Please, I want you to know that. It drives me bananas how deceived these people are when they claim to be Christians, but they won&#39;t even pick up a Bible and see what it actually says. Instead they go listen to preachers that are just totally perverting the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. The media is amping up Trump to make money. Take it directly from the CEO of CBS Les Moonves - he loves Trump because Trump makes him lots of money <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/03/16/trump-campaign-ads/">link</a></p>

<p>This DoubleD dude is obviously one of the many Trump shills that have been trying to brainwash this forum lately. Somehow a billionaire, with ties to the Clintons, endorsements from the Klan, and an advocate for water boarding, is the conspiracy candidate? Please, this is nothing more than propaganda.</p>
