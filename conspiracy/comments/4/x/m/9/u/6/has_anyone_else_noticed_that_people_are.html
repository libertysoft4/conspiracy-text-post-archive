        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been keeping track of this in a notebook. I&#39;m seeing 50% or less of drivers signalling when changing lanes in NC.  This used to be &lt;1-3 instances in 100 drivers that would do this, usually on the highway where it matters less.  Now it&#39;s 1 in 2-3, on regular streets also.  I don&#39;t know if this is a local trend, but it&#39;s not only inconsiderate it&#39;s dangerous.  I&#39;ve almost been in an accident several times from people failing to indicate.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to honk at people now even though &quot;it&#39;s rude in the south&quot;, if they are ahead of me in a one late and they slow down to turn but don&#39;t signal.  Why shouldn&#39;t I, they&#39;re not only breaking the law, if I didn&#39;t see their brake lights, I might hit them.  </p>

<p>I think this is significant, AND a conspiracy because something is happening that is very strange.  Perhaps everyone is so pissed off that their suppressed anger about what&#39;s happneing in america is manifesting itself in road rage type passive aggression.  </p>

<p>Or maybe I CERN-shifted  / berenstein&#39;d into yet another universe where people don&#39;t indicate anymore and I&#39;m the last unicorn who tries to let others know what I&#39;m doing on the road so they and I both feel safe.</p>

<p>I saw one guy in a 3 lane road go from left most to center without signalling, then pass and go into rightmost in front of a bus without signalling and then slammed brakes, almost brakechecking a full bus.  I was in the center lane, behind the bus, trying to keep a space cushion.  This stupid car almost caused a pileup.  </p>

<p>I am telling you becasue this was not an isolated incident.  I saw several of these types of violations all day long in Asheville, NC.  I recall when I was in college, I got a ticket for illegal lane change by a police in Atlanta, GA, and not using the signal to change is illegal in NC as well.</p>

<p>I see all kinds of weaving through traffic, inattentiveness at stoplights (texting on their iphone), etc.  And they don&#39;t seem to care.  I don&#39;t personally have a problem with people futzing with their phones at lights--after all, they are super boring and an indication of poor planning (ie: turnabouts are better), but at least be considerate to others by holding it up on your steering wheel,  so you know when to put that shit down and drive when the light turns green.</p>

<p>I think these &quot;my road&quot; / &quot;you aren&#39;t there&quot; behaviors are a litmus test for the coming shitpocalypse</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get this feeling everyone is collectively giving up, because a lot of people see the writing on the wall. There&#39;s a general malaise, waiting for the next big bad thing. I think people also just want this fucking election to be over. People are stressed out, sleep-deprived, underpaid, overworked, or can&#39;t find work. Many people are losing hope because they realize the path we&#39;re headed on as a nation. It&#39;s stressful and lots of people are on drugs, both legal and illegal, to calm themselves that also that cause them to pay less attention to their surroundings.</p>

<p>People are just overloaded. Like brain overload. I see it on so many people&#39;s faces. Our culture is just overwhelming and everyone has so many problems that they weren&#39;t expecting because the economy is so bad. </p>

<p>I like that you keep track of the numbers, I really enjoy that kind of quantitative analysis because it&#39;s rock solid and can be repeated if the theory distracted driver is true, which I believe it is. Except for that mandela/cern stuff, which I&#39;m going to assume was a joke. Poe&#39;s law makes it hard to tell sometimes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it wasn&#39;t a joke... so not poes law.  I keep an open mind about the mandela effect, I lived in the 70s and it wasn&#39;t &#39;stain&#39;.  It&#39;s too many things that are changed.  Like c3po&#39;s silver leg.  Oh?  you didn&#39;t know?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t decided if the CERN/Mandela thing is <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/A4276BA6-CF6E-8995-4C91-9ED993EC7D98#-202">occult mockery as control grid stuff</a> ... or a real phenom.  I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s &#39;false memory&#39; because so many people remember it being a certain way, then more examples come to light like jcpenny.</p>

Like they&#39;re sleeping through life, just consuming and taking in all of the lies and propaganda. The only time a little life comes into one of them is when I question one of the lies. These people have been taught it&#39;s never okay to be angry unless its someone questioning mainline thought. I see it all over this website too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.</p>

<p>Have you heard of the 100th monkey effect?  It&#39;s the idea that novel behaviors get adopted and then become the norm, transmitted through some unknown force, perhaps as resonant patterns, or indications that we live in simulation....</p>

<p>kind of like how in grand theft auto you never see this one rare model of vehicle, but when you do, suddenly there are like several of them in a row of different colors.  This is because the game &#39;caches&#39; models.  Maybe our universe has caching features also called social behaviors or events</p>

<p>This simulation saves RAM when it can. It&#39;s why 11, 22 and other master numbers pop up everywhere. It also explains certain synchronicities. </p>

But being it&#39;s a pet peeve of mine, I remember being pissed off maybe once every 3 months, now it&#39;s daily.  once i saw it happening, I started tracking.  But just from a historical knowledge I know it was &lt;3 of 100 would change lanes without signalling because it&#39;s illegal.  I bet cops are noticing.  Actually no, scratch that, they are some of the worst offenders.  They turn their lights on and zip through an intersection, then turn them off.  bastards</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few days ago, I was driving behind a cop, who took the turn into my neighborhood (he / she lives there as well), without even bothering to use a turn signal. It was a left turn, and the cop must have known that I was driving behind. I&#39;m still thinking about it to this day... The whole double standard aspect of it. If the situation was reversed, I would&#39;ve definitely gotten a ticket. The cops in my area have nothing better to do than issue tickets for bullshit reasons. I&#39;m actually still angry, and desperately wanted to pull the cop over in my neighborhood, but that would&#39;ve ended badly, hehehe.</p>

<p>Today, I was stopped at a red arrow, waiting to turn left, and the suv in front of me just straight up turns on red. It was safe, no cars were coming, but that got me thinking about the psychological aspect of doing that. These small acts of rebellion, in a society that we feel so powerless within. Also, the suv turned right into a development shortly after, so it wasn&#39;t like he / she was rushing to get somewhere. It was clearly a small rebellion of sorts. We feel so hopelessly trapped within our lives, within a system which only wishes to enslave us even further, that we turn to these micro rebellions. I actually do that as well, within my day to day life, in many ways. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s healthy or not, since it&#39;s just a form of self-pacification, but that&#39;s the thing... we don&#39;t know what else to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate seeing your post about this. I have noticed within the last two weeks that driving has now become really... terrifying. There was always the one reckless driver who crossed 4 lanes of traffic, but the frequency has definitely increased. More than that, I&#39;m starting to also see more major car incidents on the road.</p>

<p>I experienced a few close calls to the point that I was convinced I was going to be in a car accident myself. Probably self-fulfilling prophecy, but I got into a minor parking lot incident last week. And I pride myself on being a decent driver. </p>

<p>I like the thought that a fellow commenter mentioned, that it might be a &quot;collective conscious&quot; deal. It&#39;s hard to maintain a positive perspective when I feel bombarded by the anger and general dissatisfaction that I believe is manifesting itself on the road. That being said, it&#39;s always darkest before dawn. Perhaps people are waking up and this is merely the beginning of real change. </p>

<p>Keep safe OP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im behind you on this one, meaning, I agree. I noticed more accidents recently than ever before and I&#39;ve had more thoughts on collect consciousness theory and have experienced it first hand. But another thought I had was strange was a fear of driving. Usually i just drone out when I drive but I found this thought to be very peculiar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have, but I just assumed that somewhere in the last 9 years of being away that people stopped using them around here or that they&#39;re so used to driving on back roads that they forget to use them on the main ones. It wasn&#39;t an issue for me when I was still living in Utah a few months ago, but it has been in Arkansas since day one of moving back. It&#39;s funny you should mention it when all of us are beginning to notice the same thing. I wonder what the link is. Facebook usage? Television? Alcohol consumption? I don&#39;t know, but with the current state of things I can&#39;t imagine why people would just hand a police officer an excuse to pull them over like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I meant without time travel and CERN universes.</p>

<p>I meant what would be seen as culture/society itself fell apart, but the world kept moving without noticing as bureaucracy propped up the nation. What would create art, culture, genuine political movements, etc.. real human interaction and connectedness has fallen away. However, enough infrastructure is in place that we can still go on as consumers so no one has noticed.</p>

<p>I think this is significant, AND a conspiracy because something is happening that is very strange. Perhaps everyone is so pissed off that their suppressed anger about what&#39;s happneing in america is manifesting itself in road rage type passive aggression.</p>

<p>Honking your horn at people under the illusion that doing so will compel them to follow the laws is also a passive aggressive behavior.</p>
