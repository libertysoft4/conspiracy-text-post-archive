        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the link to my post for those who did not see.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4xgsdh/eli5_why_are_tobacco_and_alcohol_not_considered/">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4xgsdh/eli5_why_are_tobacco_and_alcohol_not_considered/</a></p>

<p>Is this censorship?</p>

<p>Edit: This was the response I received from ELI5 mods: &quot;It&#39;s a loaded question asking for debate/discussion/opinions. Not ELI5 material. Subs like <a href="/r/changemyview">/r/changemyview</a> are far better places for such discussions.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not agree with this.  My question was not loaded, I see questions like mine posted all the time.  The conversation was informative, and users were engaged enough for the post to make it to the front page. They seemed to have trouble with the actual content users were responding with, even though all rules were being followed. IMO, that is censorship.  Ugh, what has the world (and reddit) become.</p>

<p>Edit 2: After a short (respectful) discussion with the moderator, <a href="/u/rhynchelma">/u/rhynchelma</a> , the final answer I received is &quot;Sorry. We just do not have the time to argue every moderation decision. Good luck on another sub.&quot; </p>

<p>Edit 3: For anyone interested in my full conversation with three ELI5 mods. I don&#39;t buy anything, but had to play nice. This post was third on the front page when it was deleted... Their reasoning and nonchalance frustrates me. (Start at bottom and read upwards)</p>

<p>Edit 4: And now every comment and this entire post is being heavily downvoted... Why does it have to be like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s <em>extremely</em> common. More common than you would imagine. They remove posts and ban people commonly. Think of reddit as the social media American version of RT, only more censorship, and they pretend not to have a connection to propagandizing people.</p>

<p>the reddit admins post reddit webstats on the admin blog - Eglin Air Force Base has commonly been the #1 visitor / &quot;most connections to reddit&quot; out of any city in the entire world. Eglin AFB is also where the military runs &quot;online information operations&quot; and &quot;inform &amp; influence activities&quot; (which are exactly what they sound like - online propaganda posting and discussion influencing to &#39;inform and influence&#39; readers).</p>

<p>This used to be used on foreign websites, but seeing as reddit has an international audience I&#39;m sure it counts - and the law forbidding the use of military propaganda on Americans has been repealed anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they&#39;re posted periodically on the reddit.com blog  which is posted/run by the admins here, I don&#39;t have the link to that post bookmarked so you can go look for it if you want. Just try &quot;reddit blog webstats visitor statistics eglin&quot; on google if you don&#39;t feel like searching through all the admin blog posts. Eglin AFB has been the #1 source of connections to reddit multiple times.  </p>

<p>I stopped looking at the reddit blog and admin posts years ago though so I don&#39;t really know if you can still find them.  I was always sort of curious how long it would be before even that level of transparency on reddit disappeared.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really surprised considering the apparent move to &quot;upvoted.com&quot; or whatever, but according to archive.org the reddit blog post showing Eglin AFB in the top visitor stats was alive until at least 2016-07-04. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604042751/http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20160604042751/http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the same thing happen to me on Facebook recently. I never post anything controversial, and decided in one comment to share a You Tube video of a Chicago Board of Elections meeting this spring with no inflammatory text or anything. I was shocked that it was automatically deleted repeatedly, even after trying from my cell phone, laptop, bitly links, etc. And I wound up here like you. Keep digging, there are still a few bastions of free speech online. Maybe the good thing is they are starting to do it to regular ppl like us who would never question the powers that be otherwise. They are starting to be too obvious with too many people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;loaded question&quot; thing is often used as an excuse to get rid of anything that provokes an emotional response.</p>

<p>Sometimes you get trolls who post a loaded question because they&#39;re hoping to start some arguments. In your case however, it seemed like an intelligent and thought-provoking question.</p>

<p>So this is a pretty good example of somebody (reddit) making sure you have freedom from arguments by taking away your freedom to ask a question. This is how it works... just disallow certain things and then keep on stretching the definition of what&#39;s unacceptable until it includes anything you don&#39;t want to hear.</p>

<p>The other day I commented on a post on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. It said something to the effect of</p>

<p>&quot;Bump and upvoting for justice. I don&#39;t support Trump nor do I support Clinton. But if i&#39;m not mistaken it IS now a criminal investigation. She should be investigated and they the FBI should come to a conclusion.. but I also believe Trump should be questioned due his links/ties to Jeffrey Epstein&quot;</p>

<p>I went on to say that the scandal could and may very well have been false and was just people falsely accusing others hoping something sticks to the wall.</p>

<p>Received a ban an hour later.</p>

<p>Also, on the side bar one of the rules are &quot;no dissenters&quot;. This REALLY makes me question humanity. People will infringe on your right to free speech so long as it fulfills their agenda.</p>

<p>somewhat a racist and religious hivemind there since reddit banned r|coontown and r|niggers though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand that  <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> is a subbreddit for a candidate just like <a href="/r/sandersforpresident">/r/sandersforpresident</a> and <a href="/r/hillaryclinton">/r/hillaryclinton</a> , so you won&#39;t be able to post negative thing about them. This is why <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/PoliticalDiscussion">/r/PoliticalDiscussion</a> exist, but as you can see they are biased as well while they shouldn&#39;t and this is the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s gotten really bad around here pretty quick.
It makes me sad that such a well-established venue for people to really come together has been totally compromised.</p>

<p>It used to be a great place to find alternative news and livestreams for news events (since I&#39;m not on social media it was my go-to) and just in the last few months it&#39;s nearly impossible to find those things here.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s unfounded removals like OP&#39;s or burying posts in megathreads, it&#39;s basically an organized movement to water down and add static to the info and discussion people come here for.</p>

<p>So sad, and I&#39;m sorry that happened to you, OP.</p>

<p>ETA: Did anything ever come of Voat?</p>
