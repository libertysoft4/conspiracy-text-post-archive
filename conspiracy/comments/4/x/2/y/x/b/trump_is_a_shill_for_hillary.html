    <div class="md"><p>If he wanted to lose he would sit around, and do nothing. Instead of holding rallies daily. Or maybe he would just hold a big rally, take the stage, then start shouting &quot;Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!&quot; for 40 minutes straight so the media&#39;s narrative of him being racist, and coming unhinged would actually be true. As it is he is running a normal campaign except every MSM news channel is watching his every word like a hawk for the chance to get a sound byte to use against him. While Hillary mostly just hides her failing health, and has people killed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very sad to see.  And the worst part, probably, is having to watch Libs like Mika Brezinski gloat in the most self-righteousness on their high horse demanding we give up on the election and crown Hillary in August. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that gives me suspicion that this could be true is from how the media has played out. When he first announced he would be running for the Republican nomination every media source was going bonkers for this guy. For months there was talk about every aspect of trump covered even by Clinton&#39;s media regime. Every time that Clinton would win one of her states the media would congratulate her but then shift focus back onto trump as this would both distract the masses from Shillary&#39;s blatant rigged primaries and get trump a whole lot more attention as he had not yet won the Republican nomination. Now once Shillary won her spot and Trump the same all positive - attention grabbing stories were all shifted to Anti-Trump stories. Out of the 18 years that I&#39;ve lived this election is the biggest pile of shit I&#39;ve ever seen unfold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how it played out but the assumption that Trump was in on it is incorrect I think. I think it&#39;s more that once they noticed Trump was most likely going to beat Jeb Bush they decided to let him win, and wait until Clinton was nominated to completely go full bore biased 24/7 Clinton shilling. What&#39;s happening now was not the original plan because they would have preferred that no candidate was mentioning illegal immigration, or free trade/TPP like little Jebbie wasn&#39;t going to. But they have dealt with the hand they were given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This should be your indication that he is not the establishment pick. At first they were calling Trump a clown and stating there was no chance. As he became dangerously close to being nominated and now, the media treats him like he is dangerous.</p>

<p>He is dangerous for everyone making money on the current status quo. </p>

<p>Yes, there are other billionaires striving for control of the country. There are nationalist billionaires out there that are not making the money they could be because older families are keeping them out. </p>

<p>They have closed out the national market to people like trump and cant get access to the global market.</p>

<p>To me it makes since why trump is running. Even if its for a selfish reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive suspected him to be a Manchurian Candidate for sometime now. The deciding factor has not been his latest rhetoric but the moment he announced Mike Pence to run as VPOTUS. If you really wanted the lose out on feminist and women votes all around and non-religious voters you don&#39;t bring Mike Pence onboard. The guy is a walking Old Testament.</p>

<p>Edit: also note the timing of that announcement was right after the DNC and leaks. I looked at my wife and said well if he had a chance he just blew it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Hillary did not directly created ISIS, it was poor policy and miss management of the ousting of Al-Qaeda and then the release of radical detainees when we pulled out. All proof positive that she has -10% any clue wtf she is doing. Destroy a country to hunt down militants, create more strife, do nothing to better our relationship with the people, then leave, confirming the believes of the local people, generating more extremism. There is also debate if Al-Baghdadi was an extremist pre-detention or became and extremism due to his multiple years as a detainee. Prisons create better criminals and detainment centers create better, more connected extremists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pay to play = Hillary and Bill meet with leaders of war torn countries (like Congo) that have vast natural resources that the local companies do not have the revenue or advantages to access, such as oil, gold and diamonds. The a Canadian mining billionaire donates 81mil to the Clinton Foundation. Bill and Hill go to their buddies in the Congolese rebel armies and say &quot;let this guy mind for gold, he&#39;ll give you a cut&quot; and the first ever mining contract is awarded out of thin air. BTW,thats a real story and his name is Marc Rich, pardon by Bill then created Glencore, ltd. A Swiss company that is raping african countries</p>
