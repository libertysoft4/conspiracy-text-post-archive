<p>TLDR; 
I faxed them a physical, updated FOIA request, since the FOIA request via the web totalfailed because of their system.</p>

<p>UPDATE1</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4xvx16/fda_foia_request_declined_because_it_was/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4xvx16/fda_foia_request_declined_because_it_was/</a></p>

<p>UPDATE2</p>

<hr/>

<p>UPDATE3</p>

<p>I called last night and got a &#39;call back at business hours&#39;.  No voicemail.</p>

<p>I called FDA&#39;s FOIA office today and got an answer in which it was &#39;dead air&#39;.  I said, &#39;are you on mute&#39;?  Waited, hung up.  I called back, sent to voicemail.   I called back again, got a black female who wasn&#39;t super helpful.  She wouldn&#39;t even look up my FOIA request.  She said the failures &#39;weren&#39;t person&#39;  just resubmit, you might try faxing.  I asked her if there would be any reason my request might fail if I faxed it, then I read her my request.  She said it should be fine if I faxed.  </p>

<p>UPDATE4 -- So then I re-wrote it to be very clear both in intent and what I wanted and then I drove 50 total minutes to staples to fax it because I don&#39;t own a fax machine.  I faxed it and have confirmation.  I attached 2 additional pages with 100 links to NIH.GOV articles demonstrating the medial value of cannabis.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Hello, I&#39;m making an FOIA request for the following information:</p>

<p>1) The full legal names of every staff member, any lobbyist representatives, any outside agencies and/or their members, and any other decision makers involved in making the decision that Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica (aka marijuana, marihuana, pot, hashish), including their chemical analytes THC and CBD were considered by the FDA to be &#39;of no medical value&#39;, each and every time this decision was made historically, all the way back to the Nixon administration and/or the ratification and adoption of the UN&#39;s 1971 Convention on Psychotropic substances if those records beyond 1971 are not available.</p>

<p>2) When the above decisions were made, and by which FDA department</p>

<p>3) The research that was considered in making those decisions, at each time the FDA considered this matter.</p>

<p>4) A statement, under oath and subject to perjury, that the FDA has considered ALL of the research that has been published on NIH; or a statement under oath and subject to perjury, that the FDA hsa NOT considered ALL of the research that has been published on NIH; or a statement under oath and subject to perjury, that the FDA specifically will not consider the research on NIH in addition to an explanation why it has chosen not to do so.  </p>

<p>The reason for #4 is that we believe the FDA is incorrect in it&#39;s recent decision. Here is a sampling of research that proves your past decisions to consider cannabis &#39;of no medical value&#39; is incorrect and we the public are seeking to correct that error.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for receiving my FOIA request and fulfilling it to the best of your ability, and to a maximum compensation of 500 for making this information available to me.  This FOIA request has been posted online as well, on reddit, so that as community representative people are aware of our due diligence.  </p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when doing a FOIA request you have to be extremely specific, I dont know exactly how it is organized in the USA but I can tell you now that if one does something similar in australia they charge you about $6 per page + Research time ( which is about $70 a hour)..</p>

<p>If you give them a overly broad request ( like you did to the FDA) they will simply respond with, we believe this will take X hours or research, and result in a minimum of Y pages. Please send us a cheque for $z and we will be happy to begin the request.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you don&#39;t mind but I copied and re-worded some of your letter to be used as a FOI request to our government here.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we were brave enough to debate this topic and as you can expect it didn&#39;t go the way one may have hoped.</p>

<p>&quot;The latest evidence from the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is that the use of cannabis is a significant public health issue (‘Cannabis Classification and Public Health’, 2008).</p>

<p>Cannabis can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society. Legalisation of cannabis would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery that this can cause to families.</p>

<p>Legalisation would also send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs. </p>

<p>Despite the potential opportunity offered by legalisation to raise revenue through taxation, there would be costs in relation to administrative, compliance and law enforcement activities, as well as the wider costs of drug prevention and health services.</p>

<p>The UK&#39;s approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities; help dependent individuals through treatment and wider recovery support; while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply and tackling the organised crime that is associated with the drugs trade. The Government will build on the Drugs Strategy by continuing to take a balanced and coherent approach to address the evolving challenges posed.</p>

<p>There are positive signs that the Government’s approach is working: there has been a long term downward trend in drug use over the last decade, and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009/10. The number of adults aged 16-59 using cannabis in the last year in England and Wales has declined over the last decade from 9.6% to 6.7%, with cannabis use amongst young adults aged 16-24 and young people aged 11-15 following a similar pattern.</p>

It was the CIA file on myself.  they said, they may or may not have a file on me, and if they did they woudln&#39;t be obligated to share it, so stop asking.  Of course they said that in a smarter way.  The other branches of us intelligence gave me a &#39;we have no file on you&#39; response.  Which means its someone else who cut the brakes in my van.

    <div class="md"><p>I left a marine once, about a decade ago. I ended up going through four cars in six months, one brake line cut, one fuel tank tampered with, complete with locking gas cap being broken, one rearview window knocked out, and one more cut fuel line. I filed police reports. Got case numbers. Went six months later before a court date to get copies and no one could find any of it. 0_o when I got beat half to death about a year later, they managed to lose the file on that too. I don&#39;t doubt that all those files are hanging out somewhere along with my childhood medical records, which mysteriously also got lost when I got moved from Europe to here. Me, jaded? Nah, I know all my shit exists, thanks to snowden I know somewhere there is a copy. So yeah, figuring out some of the whys has been a bit of a thing. Maybe I should file some foia&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as random. Opinions get ya listed, Mk ultra flyers at a VA hospital back in the eighties, maybe generational studies I.e. Edgewood &amp; my dad, your guess is as good as mine. I don&#39;t ever dismiss T.I.&#39;s and I will never say there is no gangstalking, not that I am saying that&#39;s what happened here. I am steady looking for the whys. At least now no one thinks you are crazy when you point out there are lists. </p>

<p>Autofuckingincorrect decided to change what I wrote, had to fix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I left a marine once, about a decade ago. I ended up going through four cars in six months, one brake line cut, one fuel tank tampered with, complete with locking gas cap being broken, one rearview window knocked out, and one more cut fuel line. I filed police reports. Got case numbers. Went six months later before a court date to get copies and no one could find any of it. 0_o when I got beat half to death about a year later, they managed to lose the file on that too. I don&#39;t doubt that all those files are hanging out somewhere along with my childhood medical records, which mysteriously also got lost when I got moved from Europe to here. Me, jaded? Nah, I know all my shit exists, thanks to snowden I know somewhere there is a copy. So yeah, figuring out some of the whys has been a bit of a thing. Maybe I should file some foia&#39;s.</p>
