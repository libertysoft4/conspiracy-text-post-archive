<p>Duckduckgo (Does have google results but also own)</p>

<p>startpage (same story more or less as duckduckgo)</p>

<p>And believe it or not Bing.com is pretty fair it seems while it&#39;s from Mircosoft</p>

<p>Yet even with these search engines you can&#39;t escape the geofencing they got going on in certain countries.
I live in a &quot;free democracy&quot; or so they claim but I&#39;m more then positive that i get filtered results on ISP level </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no! How&#39;d I get that job, the pay sucks. I&#39;m no guru and I don&#39;t claim to know everything you might need hipping to but I&#39;ll try this time  since I at least have a clue about Ixquick/StartPage. I&#39;m pretty sure the world would be a better place with more rather than less of them.</p>

<p>Ixquick was  an independent stand alone search engine. Apparently not enough people used it and it&#39;s gone now even though they were very good. </p>

<p>The other half of the very same, company, StartPage,  is still left standing. They&#39;re overseas and feel like they are safe to operate more securely there. </p>

<p>You ask your search terms at  StartPage </p>

<p>StartPage then asks Google but gives no information to Google about  who it  is that&#39;s  asking them.</p>

<p>Startpage  claims it doesn&#39;t record any information about you such as your IP address.</p>

<p>I have 2 programs that tell me when there are tracking applications or third party applications on any given page  that are meant to spy on you. They are Ghostery and Privacy Badger. Both of them report there are no such applications at StartPage</p>

<p>Some pages have twenty or more and there are six  potential trackers  on the reddit  page I&#39;m typing to you on now.</p>

<p>StartPage&#39;s  claims about privacy are great but  I have no way to know if that&#39;s the hard truth. They do seem sincere and feel that superior privacy is their basis for gaining users. That alone  beats nearly all of their competition who don&#39;t even make good privacy claims. </p>

<p>OK, Un guru me  please. I&#39;m not all knowing or anywhere close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NBT ty first of all for even addressing this...please let me explain ..[.because i could seem like what a stalker or equally kinda nafarious.] but i was simply trying to find that snoo..thingy page link that you sent to me because i realized i got my [real] sister on reddit and she should look at her page ... you know what i m refering to ...right so itried going back in my  pages but i started getting confused [i am way  too reactive  and then we had 2 friday nite BERN dance parties to coordinate so way too hard to find thru my comments.... so i said to myself let&#39;s look in KBT cuz i am certain you have way more restaint or stuff to do on any given saturday ... and right on top was that link which coming from your arena i know would be effective but it also had google on it so that part was confusing .... so now you know why i was in your comments skroll ok so no worries right? 
but it caused me even more hmmmm what the hell because i have realized that they deleted [or else you deleted which would not bother me half so much] half of our conversation which i do not begin to know why they would do that or what we typed that needed deleting unless you deleted it which i would find more acceptable since you were at least half of the conversation but their censorship is confusing to me andso unnecessary and i ultimately had to find the snooy thang in my own history which when i finally pulled up her page it wasnt even half worth it  .....altho that search link is worth it [something productive always outta something completely wasteful]</p>

<p>anyway Knights you have absolutely no obligation under anything in the universe to ever send me any more of your koolness butunderstand this  i have now officially pegged you as smart and even moreso as  KOOL so you have to realize thats on you ;0  [but honestly it would be nice if you thought i might find something interesting that you would consider sending it my way] godsspeed knight before tomorrow [ iswear thats a tarot reading right there,,,,definitely thinking  wands  ... kinda magical you must realize thru the given  koolness...] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh my goodness you did say that my bad but ty greatly relived there has been so much censorship lately its like you see one thing in the morning and its scrubbed by the time you want to actually read it ... </p>

<p>anyway someone mentioned this to me so you might want to check it out ... [ i am actually confused by it ..of course!... but you &#39;ll get it cuz you are smart....]</p>

<p>check out naver.com. korean, but search for &quot;big&quot; terms, macro topics like &quot;wikileaks&quot; -- scroll past the korean results and look for the english language results that tell you what India, or Britain, and even some American places are saying, from the perspective of a search engine that isn&#39;t google. even duckduckgo still kinda uses google, they just kindly anonymize our asking of the question .. but it&#39;s still American-centric. naver, after the korean results, is really eye opening. &quot;bernie sanders&quot; as a search, or &quot;wikileaks&quot;, for instance. I doubt it would find a precise phrase as easily like &quot;what was Hemmingway&#39;s third novel?&quot; … google will take you to the wiki entry, but naver might choke on that precision. so go large with keywords... the results page is all in korean, but there are interesting links in English and they give a little english quite from each search result .. just that their algorithm is completely independent of google!...
hope that was meaningful ... but probably something you already knew...[[[ ooo ps let me know  does Ghostery and Privacy Badger. Both of them report there are no such applications at this page?TY ]]]] </p>

<p>here is something i do understand that you most likely did not  ...i do not know if i would have picked the knight card for you but since you picked it for yourself and you do know best intuitively i am guessing suit..... THE MESSAGE:</p>

<p>[also the symbolism of the card:   The knight is on a horse and it&#39;s moving, representing the fast motion of your actions and the need to go on. He is holding a piece of wood (the wand) and it is sprouting leaves at the top, another indicator of energy sprouting. He is surrounded by a desert, showing the fire that you are in. If his horse stops, its hooves will get hot and burn. If you stop moving, the &quot;fire,&quot; the dead energy, will burn you and slowly bring you down. There are flames sprouting from his helmet and armor on his arms. Also, notice how the horse is riding to the left, the left path. Many people associate &quot;left hand paths&quot; as non-traditional ways of thinking. It indicates that the need to move around, use your energy and act on instinct is possibly new to you. You might need some practice to acquire this skill.]</p>

<p>just saying but of course there are three other suits that you might find more kindred connection to ... ps did that concept of private search engine pass the test in your opinion or is startpage a better option TY for being so much fun!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why ty knight of possible wands which is fire btw  [ i mean maybe you are coins more earth .... but essentially i know very little about tarot you picked your key sos i was just guessing HA] .... you do strike me as a creative and very independent type  and very smart that comes across very strong you definitely know what you are talking about on these threads that is quite obvious [smart  as you know which is why the wands sprout the green leaves of energy which is a wonderful stroke of magic to conjure ] but alas i know mostly numerology so i can only tell you that you picked the K to start your persona which happens to be a master vibration [never to be ignored] of pyschic proportions and i am certain no mistake in tune with a more deeper inner you [that suits you btw just saying]......numbers never lie they vibrate and as pythagorus said music is math made audible and we know music is the ether that surrounds the planets ....this is what ive been listening too whilst typing to you ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=283Cp-Ru5E4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=283Cp-Ru5E4</a> </p>
