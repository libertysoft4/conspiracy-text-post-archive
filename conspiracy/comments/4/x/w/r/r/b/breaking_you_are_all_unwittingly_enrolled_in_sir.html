        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Manners</strong></p>

<p>Someone--I think maybe John Taylor Gatto--once said of the American Ruling Class was that there was really one thing that distinguished the rich from everyone else and it was: and this is a surprise: manners.  That they weren&#39;t smarter, in fact many were C students or worse (ie: al gore, gwb. clinton), it&#39;s just that many were sent through aristocrats schools like governor&#39;s school, finishing school (hillary -- all girls school, &#39;yummy&#39;), prep schools, where the vulgarities are punished out of them and they get a rolodex of influential people.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s even said that the only reason the ruling class elites go to ivy league schools is not for the education as everyone thinks in order to gain membership in one of their frats / sororities, because this membership is far more helpful at getting a high career position than any alumni group ever could be (my alumni group has helped me 0% in life, btw)</p>

<p>So the thing is: if you are reading reddit, then very likely you aren&#39;t a part of that world.  But that&#39;s ok, because i&#39;m here to tell you that thanks to the US Military Intelligence, you&#39;re going to get that education right now, and it&#39;s free.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Mrs. Snobworths Bore-ding School</strong></p>

<p>You should thank the American Ruling Class for giving you a free education in etiquette.  I mean really we complain about the costs of stuff and about socialism, but really, they&#39;ve come up with a way for your tax dollars to work for you.</p>

<p>Here is how it works.  </p>

<p>You go on the internet, and you express yourself like anyone would.</p>

<p>Then you are brigaded by 1-5 trolls/shills/sockpuppets making your opinion wrong, to try to &#39;ease&#39; you into a more establishment point-of-view...you know the &#39;correct view&#39;.  And call them what you will, they might also be called <a href="https://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/native-informant/">&#39;native informants&#39;</a>, becase after all, it was privileged/entitled white male land/slave/houseowners built this country and designed its laws and elections to only give the appearance of freedom while actually preserving the covert fascism exported from Brittania, and that selfsame demographic represents the ranks of the military intelligence sockpuppetry campaign that feeds said trolls.  Hey-0!</p>

<p>Here at News11 we managed to interview a troll.  Here&#39;s an inside look at the mind of a troll.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are mean, and we are terrible.  We attack you personally.  How?  We call you names, old chap.  Tell you how foolish you are.  You&#39;re going to get a wet one in the ear by god.  A thump on the side of the neck.  By lash or leash you&#39;ll see it our way, by Jove.  Or a right kick in the rump to send you on your way.  If all else fails, we&#39;ll accuse you of being an antisemite or racist or chauvinist--a bigot of some kind.  We don&#39;t like to use that card because it&#39;s just so overdone.  We like to think we have more style than that now. </p>

<p>I mean loike after all, we get points not for vulgarity but for how deep the psychological injury is that we see the targets complain about it for days...that&#39;s when we high five each other at lunch time...see this conspiracy nutter on reddit, she&#39;s quite mad I think--user bigblackhawk, she thinks she so clever she knows something about GMOs we don&#39;t.  So like, 3 yrs and 25 sub paginations ago she said something about how she failed to feed her new kitten when she was 12 because she was an inattentive teen bitch.  It still haunts her and she&#39;s like 55 now.  So just mention that cat, or cats dying, or animals being abused and neglected... and that bitch will go away fowevah, loike, fowever she will!  Isn&#39;t that roight, mate?  Yeh, Bringhamton knows, he did it just last week to some other chap.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, their techniques can be quite effective.  The end result of their <del>meddling in your affairs</del> assisting you to see the orthogonal worldview is that the intended target either loses all misapprehensions, becomes silent in while considering their <em>faulty</em> opinions, or perhaps most optimally--as it is the intention of said programme--the target adopts the <em>preferred establishment view</em> as her/her own and <del>becomes bodysnatched</del>learns to love the system by parrotting conventional views to others.</p>

<p><strong>Obamlingtons Primer for Young Goys and Burls</strong></p>

<p>During the course of this education, you&#39;ll learn several more things from our <em>native informants</em>.  You&#39;ll learn what bullying is and what it accomplishes, especially when you stand up to it, only to find that you must fight and fight every day, against anonymous hoards until you come to one inescapable conclusion: standing up to bullies simply does not work.</p>

<p>Your operant conditioning tax dollars at work, and it should make you as happy as Kim Jong Un in a vaseline factory.  Because it gives you choices--something we prize greatly in America, the land of the free-- you can either leave, or never share your opinion, or only express yourself in ways that are not meaningful or are conventional, or are within a prescribed spectrum of allowable parameters!  Choices are nice to have and we&#39;re <em>so</em> glad we have them.</p>

<p>And if you should feel strongly to dissent, you may do so only if it&#39;s so preposterous as to be taken as jest.  Everyone loves clowns, especially children.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is most important: by seeing the vulgarity of the bullies, day in and day out; and by agreeing with the public consensus that vulgarities are low-class, anti-intellectual--which they are--you begin to see a pattern emerge.</p>

<p>People start to argue more meaningfully.  They avoid adhominems for fear of being perceived as a controller, or mistaken as a native-informant.  After all, no one likes to be taken as a poseur or pretender.  </p>

<p>So in this way, our native informant friends are helping us develop a more rich dialogue, more impressively sourced material, more cogent narratives.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, we&#39;ll all be eating cake together on the streets because all the tables and dining halls from castle to kitchenette are on fire.</p>

<p>Would you be a dear and pass us a napkin?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the foundation of Reddit&#39;s system, you know. Say the &quot;wrong&quot; thing and you&#39;ll be downvoted so far that you can&#39;t post more than once every ten minutes. You&#39;re literally silenced for saying things that others don&#39;t like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting concept, I wrote a paper about this back in college, concerning the relationship between internet and art, and how the rise in &quot;amateurs&quot; would devalue art, and how we as a society would value art when it has no monetary value (due to piracy, streaming, revolting against greedy business practices, etc)- how would we determine what is &quot;good&quot; and I brought up social media and reddit that uses trending and the popular vote system. Reddit is very flawed in this way because, as the saying goes &quot;what&#39;s popular isn&#39;t always right, and what&#39;s right isn&#39;t always popular&quot;, and so there are numerous accounts of a redditor posting an unpopular opinion or idea and being bombarded with down votes only to be right, and subsequently praised, in the future.<br/>
It&#39;s easy to actually see this throughout history, as all great and revolutionary ideas have been ahead of their time, and met with resistance, but I think it&#39;s a dangerous precedent to set for the internet, especially since reddit is so popular and it&#39;s influence on public opinion is so massive. This site is how most people get their news and stay informed, and all people are influenced to think a certain way in regards to what they see, and if they&#39;re not seeing a real and honest depiction of the world, then we won&#39;t get honest and real remedies for the situations we&#39;re facing.  </p>

<p>I know this is kind of off-topic in regards to it being about music- I liken it to people getting &quot;garbage&quot; music, and in turn demanding &quot;garbage&quot; music, and then that turns into the status quo and influences standards, etc, etc, and it sets a dangerous precedent for art in society.  </p>

<p>I think the same goes for all other aspects of life, especially, like in alot of current situations, we except bigoty, violence, theivery and deception as the norm.  </p>

<p>EDIT: And in this case, it&#39;s not necessarily being done implicitly, but just by people not agreeing with one another and adopting a herd mentality and discrediting anything they don&#39;t believe with, on the internet, that seeps out into our daily lives.  </p>

<p>So what you are getting at is the truism of &#39;we have to be the change we want to see in the world&#39;.  Even though it&#39;s rough, because there seems to be an abundance of critics and corresponding scarcity of auteurs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I used to think that quote was a cliche (and it is, but the kind of cliche that loses it&#39;s potency over time), but I recently started reading Buckminster Fuller and he said the same thing, in a different way, but he actually lived his life to be change he wanted to see in the world- he denounced the idea of working for a living and he saw that if we didn&#39;t turn our world around in a few years (this was the 1980s) that we would soon reach a point beyond no return. He indeed never &quot;worked for a living&quot;, and sought to only serve mankind, and he&#39;s changed humanity forever.  </p>

<p>Now what if everyone could do that?<br/>
I think we can.<br/>
He thought we could.  </p>

<p>In his book, <em>Critical Path</em>, he outlines the history of the world- talking about the global elites subversion of people throughout time- detailing the development of our economic systems, how the Church and the Roman Empire both perpetuated the Flat-Earth myth to maintain their power, how J.P. Morgan was involved in WWI, and many other interesting ideas on how the capitalist elites took over the government through Eisenhower, established the C.I.A (what Bucky refers to as &quot;Capitalism&#39;s, Invisible Army&quot;) started the Cold War, or what Bucky calls WWIII, to destroy socialism, their primary enemy, and control the world(diving into the USSR, Latin America, a lot of issues in the Middle East). He even predicted the billion dollar bailouts of large corporations by taxpayers in the 2000s.<br/>
He then outlines his ideas about how to create a society where everyone can survive, as he believed we had the technology for everyone in the world to live comfortably without working, and he believed in harnessing the power of the sun and gravity to meet our energy needs. 
He <a href="https://bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/dymaxion-world">built self-sufficient homes, vehicles and lavatories</a>,  he conceived a &quot;one ocean, one continent&quot; map to help people grasp a better understanding of their place as &quot;passengers aboard the Spaceship Earth&quot; <a href="https://bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/world-game">(he also used this map to present the idea of a universal 100% effecient power grid that supplied power for one hemisphere while the other hemisphere slept)</a>. He came up with the concepts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization">&quot;ephemeralization&quot;</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller">&quot;synergetics&quot;</a>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity">&quot;tensegrity&quot;</a>.<br/>
The dude was a remarkable human being and he truly embodied being &quot;the change you want to see in the world&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I AM NOW CLOSE TO 88 and I am confident that the only thing important about me is that I am an average healthy human. I am also a living case history of a thoroughly documented, half-century, search-and-research project designed to discover what, if anything, an unknown, moneyless individual, with a dependent wife and newborn child, might be able to do effectively on behalf of all humanity that could not be accomplished by great nations, great religions or private enterprise, no matter how rich or powerfully armed.- Buckminster Fuller  </p>

<p>Back to art.<br/>
Historically art has been the epicenter of revolution and civil disobedience.  Art was used to subvert the authorities power without their knowing, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to maintain the integrity of our artistic culture- because of course some art should for entertainment and leisure, but there&#39;s a dire need for &quot;protest&quot; art. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that Bob Dylan was around in the &#39;60s. He was a voice that everyone heard in a time when everyone needed it- what if he had relegated to playing with The Turtles??<br/>
He gave a voice to those who needed it, and he even turned against those who supported him because of his own intuition- by going electric- and he changed culture forever. It was okay to not be a wonderful singer, and it was okay to play whatever instruments you wanted. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not one of those people who likes to say &quot;Music was better in the &#39;60s&quot;, but I&#39;m not seeing a lot of protest singers today.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s more off topic of my point, but what I was trying to say is I think there&#39;s a moral standard that should be maintained in art, because at the very least if you can&#39;t find it in art, where can you find it? I think the internet has such a strong influence because most people aren&#39;t expressing their own opinions, but opinions of others, and worse we do have people actively subverting our information- so an artist can have their career destroyed <em>just. like. that.</em>, and people are robbing themselves of life-enriching art, the kind of art that makes this whole thing called life bearable. The same sort of subersion we so online in politics and social commentaries is happening in the art and culture world too, yet I think it&#39;s on a more subconscious level where IF WHAT YOU SAY ISN&#39;T POPULAR, IT&#39;S WRONG!, and that&#39;s very dangerous.   </p>

<p>EDIT: I also wanted to talk about how I feel like, adding on to my last sentence, there&#39;s this really weird divisive dilemma happening where people, because of social media, feel <em>realy entitled</em> to their opinions, and <em>really hold on them, for dear life</em> and &quot;if you disagree, you&#39;re wrong/idiot/fag/derogatory statement!&quot; and the climate of the internet makes it okay, in a weird way, and that&#39;s something we&#39;re going to have to deal with in the coming years.<br/>
I do think it is (it being the very extreme and almost violently held beliefs and opinions people are expressing, and any other view is wrong) part of &quot;the plan&quot; though, because it&#39;s a classic example of &quot;divide and conquer&quot;.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never thought that timeout thing was good or fair.  It certainly hasn&#39;t stopped trolls. </p>

<p>I have to say though, things were REALLY bad when the stormfront people were still around.  Imagine conspiratard people attacking everyone all the time.  That&#39;s what it was around 2012-2013 ish.  Pao kicked them out.  And her reward: she was a shitty SJW and they got her fired.  I never felt that handling of this situation was right.  I mean this new guy is much worse of a person.  ANd she actually did help.  For example, I don&#39;t feel censored in this sub (go outside of this sub tho...which makes me wonder...about honeypots and corrals). </p>

If you are interested in how this works, the editor from EIR gave a talk in the 90s which I posted about how Brittania brainwashed the world.  It&#39;s a 100% total awesome talk.  Everyone should listen to it.  It will change your worldview.  I had to fact check him on some thigns and turns out, yep, EIR pretty much nails it 100/100 by my count.  I haven&#39;t caught them saying anything wrong or omitting something super important  (omissions are sometimes just mistakes...that is the out)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll reiterate what i wrote some time ago on the guilt-trip TPTB try to shame politically curious people into (it something i elaborated on TRP concepts so to be clear, thinking about the dichotomies between sexual game and political game)</p>

<p>Basically you don&#39;t give them satisfaction. You embrace things as they are, but you refuse to feel guilty for that. Even more so, you feel glorious. Faked if it needs be, but after emotionally adjusting it can be real. I know i feel it often after some self training.</p>

<p>Basically be condescendent. Prove your point by agreeing and amplyfying theirs so that the absurdity is revealed, tackle the weak points and never stop feeling good about it. Then the troll has 2 options: ignoring you and saving what&#39;s not lost yet or try again to bait you into heated conversation (where he wins by default). Only now you got him baited and can proceed to troll him yourself with the one-liners he loves so much. </p>

<p>Ignore politics in real life as much as you can, show non-concerned, then when people try to make you care you can just spew some ugly truth laughing like it&#39;s nothing to you. Pretend you don&#39;t really care. That leaves no anchor. In the end, the hurt one will be the deluded troll/sjw because you reversed their game. Instead of accepting the doubt they try to push on you, the guilt, and the emotional process, you dismiss it as childish non-sense and with it perhaps the conversation too. </p>

<p>If you go &quot;I know the truth and i&#39;m mad about it&quot; you are easily baitable and likely will be.
If you instead are &quot;it&#39;s just fucked up lol, who cares&quot;, they&#39;ll be disappointed at how easily you can skip their bait.
As bonus, potential deluded sjws that act as useful idiots may start doubting their naive worldview.</p>

<p>Basically act the same as an elite player, only with different beliefs to push. The key is to not have an obvious, emotional-based core to your opinion.
First remember not to care beyond small-talk, then present your informed opinion. It&#39;s the only way you disarm the trolls in real life. For online, the first part is my strategy.</p>

<p>The only way you can make your opinion win is to not hold it as a part of your identity, or if you do to make it untouchable from the outside.</p>

<p>Else you become some kind of reverse SJW on which they are free to shit upon. The average &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as perceived by the mass. You have informed opinions, now work on how to preserve and spread them subvertly. The elites didn&#39;t win by protesting in plazas, they won by silent subversion and exceptional steadyness in their purpose.</p>

<p>Instead of being the protester, you may become the guy who rally thousands who would have stayed at home that day. And that&#39;s the guy that makes a difference and can have the best laugh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting concept, I wrote a paper about this back in college, concerning the relationship between internet and art, and how the rise in &quot;amateurs&quot; would devalue art, and how we as a society would value art when it has no monetary value (due to piracy, streaming, revolting against greedy business practices, etc)- how would we determine what is &quot;good&quot; and I brought up social media and reddit that uses trending and the popular vote system. Reddit is very flawed in this way because, as the saying goes &quot;what&#39;s popular isn&#39;t always right, and what&#39;s right isn&#39;t always popular&quot;, and so there are numerous accounts of a redditor posting an unpopular opinion or idea and being bombarded with down votes only to be right, and subsequently praised, in the future.<br/>
It&#39;s easy to actually see this throughout history, as all great and revolutionary ideas have been ahead of their time, and met with resistance, but I think it&#39;s a dangerous precedent to set for the internet, especially since reddit is so popular and it&#39;s influence on public opinion is so massive. This site is how most people get their news and stay informed, and all people are influenced to think a certain way in regards to what they see, and if they&#39;re not seeing a real and honest depiction of the world, then we won&#39;t get honest and real remedies for the situations we&#39;re facing.  </p>

<p>I know this is kind of off-topic in regards to it being about music- I liken it to people getting &quot;garbage&quot; music, and in turn demanding &quot;garbage&quot; music, and then that turns into the status quo and influences standards, etc, etc, and it sets a dangerous precedent for art in society.  </p>

<p>I think the same goes for all other aspects of life, especially, like in alot of current situations, we except bigoty, violence, theivery and deception as the norm.  </p>

<p>EDIT: And in this case, it&#39;s not necessarily being done implicitly, but just by people not agreeing with one another and adopting a herd mentality and discrediting anything they don&#39;t believe with, on the internet, that seeps out into our daily lives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never thought that timeout thing was good or fair.  It certainly hasn&#39;t stopped trolls. </p>

<p>I have to say though, things were REALLY bad when the stormfront people were still around.  Imagine conspiratard people attacking everyone all the time.  That&#39;s what it was around 2012-2013 ish.  Pao kicked them out.  And her reward: she was a shitty SJW and they got her fired.  I never felt that handling of this situation was right.  I mean this new guy is much worse of a person.  ANd she actually did help.  For example, I don&#39;t feel censored in this sub (go outside of this sub tho...which makes me wonder...about honeypots and corrals). </p>
