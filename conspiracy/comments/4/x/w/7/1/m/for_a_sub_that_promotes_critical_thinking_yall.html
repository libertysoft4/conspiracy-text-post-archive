    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It is difficult in general to find critical thinking and intelligent responses on Reddit. I stay because eventually I find good content, but mostly it is people trying to be the loudest voice in the crowd without actually trying to improve the conversation.</p>

<p>A good example is the recent debacle on the WikiLeaks subreddit. Someone posted obviously misleading information so I (and others) called him out on it. He eventually admitted to finding out that he was incorrect but refused to edit his original post. He agreed that it was misleading but it appeared that he was so proud of all of his many upvotes that he refused to delete the misleading post and repost a new thread with accurate information.</p>

<p>Even though I was right by calling him out for spreading misinformation, and the WikiLeaks mods even added a &quot;Debunked&quot; tag to his post, I am still receiving downvotes for attempting to bring truth to the sub.</p>

<p>I&#39;m somewhat new to Reddit, but at least this situation helped me to realize some people just don&#39;t want to hear the truth and will get angry with you for trying to bring it into the conversation. I decided to unsubscribe from that sub when I realized the majority there appreciate misinformation more than truth.</p>

<p>Edit: I fixed a typo, and realized how long this rant/post was so here is a TL;DR:</p>

<p>Everyone is different. Some are critical thinkers and some hate hearing the truth. Pick your battles and avoid the subs that avoid the truth.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just something so enjoyable about guiding someone to the place where they must either admit that they don&#39;t know why they believe what they do, or resort to ad hominem attacks to try to silence you.</p>

<p>Admitted, it&#39;s not a good strategy for accumulating &quot;karma&quot;, but all reddit karma ever meant was that you could flick the collective consciousness&#39; bean really well.</p>

<p>I think many posters here already acknowledge that her <em>&#39;winning&#39;</em> the Presidency is the plan under motion and all actors have been put into position to ensure that. If you want to preach to hardcore delusional Trump supporters that won&#39;t even entertain him being a paid actor, you might want to head to, yes, r/thedonald or /pol/.</p>

In fact, just look to be elections last year and notice how many republican governors were elected. Notice how many people attend trump tallies in comparison to Clinton. I believe the media has finally become state propaganda, and the voters will tell them it didn&#39;t go unnoticed in November. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly you dont understand the subs point, it&#39;s not about the inimitable win for Hillary Clinton, just because something is going to happen doesn&#39;t make it right. Also I personally have nothing against seeing someone else&#39;s views but when you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re wrong. And so how hypocritical of you to say thought out response with nothing say why you&#39;re blanket statement is right. We should all roll over and take more of the same senseless beating that&#39;s been going on for years, decades even. The fact Hilary Clinton can have so many damaging facts come out about her and walk out of it uninhibited is absolutely wrong. So wether you like it or not this sub is far from an echo chamber for one and two, just because Hilary is going to win wether we like it or in no way makes it justified. None of us are in denial, we are all just coming to realize the system that we live in that sooo many choose to be in denial about.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People do die every day, but not to a &quot;&quot;theft&quot;&quot; in which nothing was stolen.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, while I do think that arguing on semantics is stupid, &quot;winning&quot; implies it was fair, at least to me.</p>

<p>As far as Elliott Smith goes, you do bring up a good point, I wasn&#39;t aware of that. You should probably open with things like this rather than making an entire post saying &quot;you&#39;re an echo chamber&quot; without things like this.</p>

<p>That could very well be the case, although it&#39;s still sketchy in my opinion, and it still doesn&#39;t clear up Seth Rich&#39;s story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty ive never met an actual Clinton supporter. Her &quot;support&quot; is all manufactured. Im sure there are some idiots out there that do blindly support her but not enough to even come close to the Trump machine. Not saying Trump is better saying Trump has the popular vote by a longshot. I personally think they are both jack asses and 3rd party voting should be the only option at this point but the reality is that the election is just a facade. </p>

<p>We KNOW Clinton is a horrible person that has done horrible unspeakable things. What Clinton/Obama have done to the stability of the world makes Trump look like a carebear.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right about this sub.  The anti-Hillary hysteria looks like it&#39;s being paid for.  When the top anti-Hillary post has 4500 upvotes, and the next closest is 200, it just looks like someone&#39;s buying upvotes.  And the same ten posts on every page, reposted over &amp; over.</p>
