        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Clintons have gotten to Seth Rich&#39;s parents (Joel and Mary) and have completely silenced them.   It is obvious to see the before/after of when the order of silence took place - immediately after Julian Assange made his announcement regarding Seth and his possible link to the Clinton&#39;s emails.  </p>

<p>Prior to that announcement, his parents spoke freely and lovingly about Seth; immediately after Assange&#39;s announcement, the Rich&#39;s were silenced and only a Democratic spokesman (<strong>Brad Bauman</strong>) would speak for them and would do so disparaging any and all people who believed of the Clinton&#39;s involvement (with Bauman calling these people <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/08/family-of-slain-dnc-staffer-seth-rich-blasts-nutters-for-spreading-harmful-wikileaks-conspiracies/">&quot;nutters&quot;</a>). </p>

<p>Take a look at this timeline of Daily Mail articles:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3685119/DNC-staffer-27-dies-shot-multiple-times-4am-Washington-DC.html">July 11:</a>  Joel and Mary talk lovingly about Seth; for example, his mother Mary saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Our son may have had a short life but he had a very wonderful life that he smiled and enjoyed.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3688415/Father-DNC-staffer-Seth-Rich-tells-son-wanted-make-difference-phone-girlfriend-nurdered-deserted-Washington-DC-street-family-prepares-funeral.html">July 13</a>:  This was the Daily Mail&#39;s headline (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>EXCLUSIVE: DNC staffer&#39;s</em> <strong><em>father tells</em></strong> <em>how his son, 27, who &#39;wanted to make a difference&#39; was on his cell with his girlfriend when he was murdered on a deserted Washington DC street as family attends his funeral</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3724508/Parents-slain-DNC-staffer-Seth-Rich-ask-help-three-weeks-slain-DC-street.html">August 4:</a> Seth&#39;s parents continue to call out for help in finding his murder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Mary Rich has appealed to the public to help catch her son&#39;s killer</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aug 9:  Julian Assange announces the reward for information/capture of Seth&#39;s killer.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3726250/Enemies-Hillary-Bill-say-27-year-old-murder-victim-Seth-Rich-suspected-leaking-DNC-emails-belongs-Clinton-Death-List-people-ties-couple-died-time.html">Aug 10:</a>  <strong>Immediately after that,</strong> Joel and Mary Rich are silenced and are no longer allowed to speak to the press.</p>

<p>They now have to have a spokesman speak for them.  This spokeman is <strong>Brad Bauman</strong>, who is a <strong>Democratic operative.</strong>  This is his current position, per his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradbauman">LinkedIn page</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Managing a crisis communications and full service public relations firm</em></li>
<li><em>Providing strategic communications advice to Democratic candidates and labor unions</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Brad Bauman has turned the narrative from finding Seth&#39;s killer to that of disparaging the current coverage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Outrage at Julian Assange for implicating murdered DNC staffer in email leak and offering $20k reward</em> </p>

<p><em>&#39;Some are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good,&#39; a spokesman for Rich&#39;s parents told Daily Mail Online</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Once again, the Clinton&#39;s have silenced people they don&#39;t want to talk.  This time it is the parents of murder victim Seth Rich - Joel and Mary Rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed a definite change on r/politics since 8/10. I figured it was because they clearly turned the knobs to 11 after Trump&#39;s 2nd Amendment comments and then realized they had been way too obvious and went way overboard. It was a total joke. Maybe something else caused them to release their r/politics bear hug though.</p>

<p>Some of the donor confidentially and highers are out in the open from the DNC leaks.  If it was me on that side, I would be very nervous.  They are making enemies with a lot of people out there.</p>

<p>Ask yourself; who would go from asking for help in finding a murderer and when that help comes (5 days later mind you) the help is shunned away? It doesn&#39;t add up at all. Good job ppinting this out; i hope a lot of people see this.</p>

The host kept saying that the local police were investigating the &quot;failed robbery&quot; and everybody should just let this poor man rest in peace by inferring that those who suggest the DNC had anything to do with Seth&#39;s murder should feel ashamed.
