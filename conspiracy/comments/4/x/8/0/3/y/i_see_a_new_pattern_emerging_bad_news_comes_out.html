        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m talking about Hillary being involved with the funding and arming of ISIS because she was Secretary of State during the Iraq war and the DoD&#39;s supplies have repeatedly ended up in ISIS hands and has been documented repeatedly.</p>

<p>So wikileaks comes out with this damning claim about clinton directly funding ISIS, and the next day Trump makes the &quot;2nd amendment people&quot; comment and goes full bonkers, and then immediately after starts talking about the ISIS being funded by Hillary stuff. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same as this sub, where the truths are mixed with crazy derailing comments, so that people throw the baby out with the bathwater because they want to avoid the crazy. Trump is the IRL version of that, they allowed him through because he speaks the truth, but he&#39;s a wannabe dictator crazy guy. It&#39;s like you can&#39;t say anything bad about Clinton, because the rebuttal is always an enraged &quot;Do you want Trump to win, asshole!?&quot; Trump has been an amazing boon to the Democratic Party. As long as he says something, it&#39;s automatically untrue. So any inconvenient truths can be filtered through him by the media focusing on HIM saying it, as if he were the only one saying it, and then the message is lost because people reject the messenger. </p>

<p>So I say yesterday &quot;Hillary played a big role in funding and supporting ISIS&quot; because the wikileaks info comes out, and then today Trump says the same, and now I look like a crazypants Trump supporter and everyone is trying their best to ignore what I&#39;m saying, for the good of the country as they see it. Because Trump must lose, so Hillary must win, so this Hillary-ISIS connection must be ignored at all costs. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It&#39;s been organized as a two party system to funnel people in to making &quot;obvious&quot; moral choices, a system which is exploited by Hillary and many other elected leaders. </p>

<p>People will ignore true information if you make the source of that information look bad. So if any true info goes through Trump, and the media focuses on him saying it over anyone else, most people will ignore the info. Amazingly advanced PR/propaganda tactics that I hope everyone understands thoroughly, because we will be seeing a lot more of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it. This was even the premise of a big piece in a Norwegian MSM newspaper (the biggest one) yesterday. The MSM itself, even though it&#39;s on Hillary&#39;s side, is actually openly acknowledging this problem. It&#39;s starting to be really obvious that Trump is a Clinton plant, and that he&#39;ll crash his own campaign to make sure she wins, despite how criminal she is.</p>

<p>When even the Clinton-friendly MSM is starting to complain about how Trump is making Hillary look good, you know something is wrong with the guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Interesting that is being talked about in Norwegian MSM. And then after losing he&#39;ll probably be appointed as a cabinet member or get some super-beefy government contract or something, as a payoff, in addition to all the fame he is getting now (which he obviously craves). I could easily imagine them having this agreement, or their handlers having this agreement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i was a little nervous that trump was going to win because of the supreme court justices, but if it&#39;s a bunch of gun control justices coming from hillary that&#39;s just as bad as a bunch of conservative justices coming from trump.  it&#39;s like abortion and civil liberties vs. guns.  </p>

<p>trump is definitely a plant.  there was that news story about how the clintons called him up and got him to run, they used to be friends, probably still are.  that&#39;s why all the republicans were super nervous about him getting elected in the first place. </p>

<p>it&#39;s crazy to watch donald trump do this to his image, i guess when you&#39;re a billionaire it doesn&#39;t really matter very much, and he&#39;s used to being disliked already anyway.  </p>

<p>it&#39;s all just an illusion of choice.  if jill stein would&#39;ve been smarter and kept her opinions on wifi to herself and distanced herself from the homeopathic side of shit, she still wouldn&#39;t have won, but would have set a precedent of getting at least double digit votes in the election for a third party.</p>

<p>people go on about how great it&#39;s going to be to have the first woman president, and how it breaks the glass ceiling, but they&#39;re not seeing the other side of the precedent that it sets, which is that an ex president&#39;s significant other is going to become president.  that harks back to monarchy in britain.  king and queen shit. a terrible fucking precedent.  bloodlines and dynasties right out the open.  they&#39;re not even trying to hide it anymore.  </p>

<p>tldr:  no matter what everyones fucked.  we&#39;re going to lose more of our rights.  trumps a plant.  it&#39;s just an illusion of choice.  royal blood lines sucked three hundred years ago and they still fucking suck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t intend to imply it was a bad thing to vote for third party. The person I was responding to made it out to seem like they didn&#39;t want to vote at all. I attempted to make the argument that they should cast their vote for a third party instead of not voting. If you don&#39;t think the person(s) in power aren&#39;t fit to govern (no confidence) then it&#39;s time for a regime change. Voting third party wouldn&#39;t get that (my opinion), but it&#39;d send a message and that message carries more weight the more people participate.</p>

<p>If a lot of people do, that message is that a regime change is imminent if things don&#39;t improve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s like they&#39;re in a race to be the most outlandish, only Hillary&#39;s stuff is actual important stuff she did while acting as Secretary of State, whereas Trump&#39;s day-to-day scandals are mainly personality-based and based on his mouth that is out of control. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s interesting like you said that when Clinton makes a big fuck-up, instead of Trump standing back and letting her make a fool of herself, he seems to instantly up the ante himself! It&#39;s like he&#39;s keeping pace with her, but her email leaks are setting the pace. Which to me just reinforces the idea that he is there to ensure that Hillary wins, whether he knows it or not. Both parties are bought out by the same military-industrial and big money interests, that at least is very clear at this point. </p>

Otherwise, the media will ignore his speech, and so will a lot of people.  However, if they think Trump called for an assassination, or kicked a baby out of his rally, they might check out a clip on youtube (or it even may end up on the news) of Trump saying something important, spliced in with the &#39;gaffe&#39; that drew the viewer in in the first place.

    <div class="md"><p>Right, so look at this way.  Your Joe Blow, 43 year old factory worker who just got laid off, has never been into (or even understood) politics, and rarely watch the news.  Now suddenly, you hear about this funny politician who&#39;s &quot;literally Hitler&quot; and is kicking babies out of his rallies, you see the clip, and hear that China is devaluing it&#39;s currency to give it an unfair advantage in manufacturing.  You&#39;ve never been into politics, but this resonates with you, and so you start watching full Trump rallies and eventually, for the first time in your life, decide you are going to vote.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is what Trump has been doing, he&#39;s luring in huge numbers of people who have never voted before, and have never been into politics, in an environment where the media is against him and he has(had) limited funds to work with.  For most, this would be an impossible task, and yet through this peculiar method, we are seeing results.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unintentional or surprising from  a man with an IQ of 156, who has written a book that includes quite a bit of information on how to work the media, to be planning out complex moves like this.</p>

<p>You might think what he&#39;s doing is stupid, but you are looking at it from your politically-minded perspective, as well as with whatever ideological biases you may or may not have.  People like you only make up a certain percentage of the potential-voting population, there is huge swathes of people that will respond to different things than you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Full disclosure, I am a Trump supporter.   I don&#39;t think Trump is in on it at all.   The media just manufactures a controversy where there is none to take attention away.   The baby thing was a huge farce, you have CNN with fictitious articles up when they have anchors admitting on air they are trying to help her get into office, and yet I can&#39;t find a single, actual thing that makes Trump to be the person I used to also be fooled into thinking he was.   They are doing everything they can to smear the man.   Nobody who is as crazy as they say he is can be as successful as he has been.   They can&#39;t even get his exes or former employees to say anything bad about the guy.   The fact that their most legit bad finding about him was an incident of acting up in 2nd grade while the entire globalist establishment of both parties is scared shitless of him is enough to make me think he is genuine.</p>

In my honest opinion it was Cruz that really freaked them out because he is a boy scout (love it or hate it about him) that doesn&#39;t bend on principals. I clearly remember guys like Mitch McConnel and John Boehner being much more vitriolic towards Cruz than they&#39;ve been to Trump...I mean doesn&#39;t Trump play golf with Boehner? And seriously, how can you ignore that Trump IS friends with the Clintons?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was a huge celebrity and businessman for years.  He tried his hand in politics with the reform party years ago, until it got taken over by people he didn&#39;t want to associate with.  I don&#39;t think he wanted to be involved, but he can see the writing on the wall now with what the globalists are really trying to do in destabilizing the U.S. to the point of no return.  </p>

<p>The media has never gone after a single candidate like they have with Trump.  This isn&#39;t normal liberal media shilling.  This is an insane amount of word twisting and flat out making shit up.  They are going after Trump at a level that far surpasses what they did to Romney and McCain.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t need to manufacture anything. Trump really just is that outlandish. On being interviewed on his whole &quot;Obama founded ISIS&quot; remarks, while on a conservative talkshow, he <em>doubled down</em> and said he meant them <em>literally</em> while the host pitched him every conceivable out. He actively and consistently made his words seem worse to the general public and got a conservative pundit to have to defend Obama by saying that he didn&#39;t think he founded or supported ISIS.</p>

<p>I think a good Occam&#39;s Razor explanation is that Trump actively doesn&#39;t want to be president but wants all the attention that comes with it. He&#39;ll milk this for what it&#39;s worth since he knows he&#39;s never going to have a better time in the spot like while simultaneously guaranteeing he&#39;ll never have any actual real responsibilities post election.</p>

<p>Nothing potential about it.  Telling people that Mexico will pay for a multi-billion dollar border wall is pure bullshit.  Giving people a truly horrific math lesson is pure bullshit.  It&#39;s not potential.</p>

But if I could only choose one of the two, I&#39;m honestly not sure, but I&#39;m 51/49 towards Hillary because at least we wouldn&#39;t lose as much face internationally, and wouldn&#39;t be run by a hothead. But in reality the same result would come from either of them being elected, that is more war and more money for the banks and military-industrial complex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See that is where you lost track of the big picture. Hillary won&#39;t just be more war and more money for the banks and military-industrial complex...business as usual. It is more serious than that.  They are working towards an agenda and she is to continue that agenda. Once Hillary has the majority in the supreme court the constitution is over, meaning this country is over.  Trump and Hillary don&#39;t matter. The only thing that matters is that the supreme court opening is filled by a judge that will actually follow the constitution instead of reinterpreting it to fit the needs of the agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve already admitted that Hillary would sell out to the military industrial complex, banks, and war. So that argument cancels it&#39;s self out. They will both sell out.  But one plans to put a constitution following supreme court judge in and the other plans to put a sell out judge in. That is the only difference. Trump is the lesser evil. Trump&#39;s judge will save what&#39;s left of the country from being dismantled until we can take it back somehow. Trump equals hope for the future. Hillary equals submission to the end of America as we know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I edited my post to explain a bit more. But basically I think theres a lot of people who think they&#39;re &quot;doing the right thing&quot; by ignoring any bad information about Clinton that might help Trump win. They feel by ignoring and shunning this information, they&#39;re doing a moral good for the nation and future generations. Especially since they see the bad news coming from Trump, a guy who is a known liar. </p>

<p>So instead of there being a national discussion about how Hillary had a role in funding ISIS to overthrow Assad, we are instead watching a media focused on laughing at a clown saying violent nonsense, of which there are some truths thrown in there too. But everyone dismisses the truths, because it looks like Trump came up with these ideas himself, because the media frames it that way. So hundreds of millions of good-intentioned Americans are being very very quiet right now despite knowing deep down something is wrong. The willful ignorance, in the name of the good of society. Those are the well-intentioned bricks that are paving the road to hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pattern i&#39;ve noticed is that he always slips a &#39;gaffe&#39; (intentionally) into a speech around the same time as something important.  Otherwise, the media will ignore his speech, and so will a lot of people.  However, if they think Trump called for an assassination, or kicked a baby out of his rally, they might check out a clip on youtube (or it even may end up on the news) of Trump saying something important, spliced in with the &#39;gaffe&#39; that drew the viewer in in the first place.  IRL click-bait, basically.</p>
