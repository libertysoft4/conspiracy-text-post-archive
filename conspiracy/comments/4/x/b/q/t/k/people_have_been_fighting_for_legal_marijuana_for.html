<p>It might also end all these cozy relationships with bureaucrats/functionaries that are ultimately responsible for signing off on many of these decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading a ton and there is a model that hasn&#39;t been tried where the people are the government. Instead of two separate entities, there is just one. It&#39;s a bit of a long explanation but I am sure it would work. The idea is to remove power from the few and scatter it over the people and each person has equal power as an adult. That&#39;s mixed with a genius economic system called &quot;sacred economics&quot; would transform this nightmare into a paradise within a year. I only wish people had a bit more courage because a lot of them are scared to take a new direction even though they are standing in the middle of a burning building. There would be no need to fight the government. We can do it and disregard the government like they don&#39;t even exists. Overtime, they will give up. Also, we defund them by not paying anymore in taxes. I understand people get scared but fear is the real enemy. Once that&#39;s put aside, everything is easy. It will be a blast and we will all have a lot of fun in the process as well. I&#39;m talking the time of your life. People will feel alive again and we will get closer together which is actually very important. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is the easiest and probably the best way to make an immediate and resounding point.</p>

<p>Unfortunately even people that seem informed will often argue about how you have a responsibility as a citizen to pay your taxes for the services you receive as part of society. They have zero idea that the lion&#39;s share of your taxes go to private financiers to cover the ever increasing interest on &quot;borrowed&quot; money.</p>

<p>But yeah…a nation wide effort to get people to stop paying taxes would send a strong message.</p>

<p>You&#39;d also get attacked by the &quot;sanctify the military&quot; people. They would scream far and wide about how the non payment of taxes puts the heroes fighting for your freedom at risk.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people that simply will never wish to be unplugged from the safety of their media constructed reality</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All these fears are just fears. The idea is to roll with the punches and stay responsible as a people. We encounter problems daily and fix them. We have 300 million people to work with here. We only need a centralized location (probably online) to communicate. </p>

<p>The secret to eliminating fear is love believe it or not. It acts as light against darkness. People are freezing up because of fear but if we came together like a giant family and expressed comradery and love, these fears will disappear and unblock our path to progress. The government wants us to only worry about ourselves because they know it weakens us. When we serve each other and ourselves at the same time equally, we are unstoppable. In this form, massive accomplishments will be made very, very quickly. That&#39;s when people will have an epiphany and realize how powerful a cohesive group is and they will connect it all together. They will realize what it took mentally to alter the future. Basically, they will have to treat everyone like family in order to unblock fear and move forward as a unit with a set of agreed upon goals. All these steps are needed. People can&#39;t move forward while frozen in fear. We may lose some people due to a retaliation of some sort, but we have to keep trucking forward to what I feel deep in my soul to be a paradise.  </p>
