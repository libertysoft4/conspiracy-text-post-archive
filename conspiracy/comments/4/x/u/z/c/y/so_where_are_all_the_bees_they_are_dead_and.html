    <div class="md"><p>Its not just the pesticide, there are some locations where this pesticide has no effect. We spent a few weeks in invertebrae zoology discussing CCD. There is multiple combinations of factors dwindling the bees down to nothing. Lack of available habitat, temperature changes, varroa mites, and the livestock esque treatment of honey bees now. We have controlled settings with specific diets and antibiotics prescribed to honey bees. Like humans and other livetock, it affects their ability to adapt to the natural world. Yes pesticides are bad, but there&#39;s way more to this story that people need to be aware about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copypasta from your link: <em>&quot;Several possible causes for CCD have been proposed, but no single proposal has gained widespread acceptance among the scientific community. Suggested causes include: infections with Varroa and Acarapis mites; malnutrition; various pathogens; genetic factors; immunodeficiencies; loss of habitat; changing beekeeping practices; or a combination of factors.[10] A large amount of speculation has surrounded a family of pesticides called neonicotinoids as having caused CCD</em>&quot;</p>

<p>And you type that the Wiki basically blames it on neonicotinoids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im just saying neonicotinoids have the most backing as to the reason. Its all theory, but a combination of things is highly likely. Yet again, we have a logical fallacy on r/conspiracy, a red herring. dont address the actual info, but bring up something completely different. The ultimate point here is that its not natural that the Bee population is collapsing and is a sign of things to come, just shit on all the evidence, attack the person and bring up random info that castrates the argument, not this time broseidon, king of the brocean. Logical fallacies aside, you make a point, the jury is out on why, but that doesnt matter. the fact is that its happening and at an alarming rate. Do you spend most of your time just counter arguing or do you actually come to your own conclusion</p>

<p>How much quality research have you done to draw that conclusion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dont address the actual info</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you providing information based on quality research you&#39;ve done yourself, or at least tried to look for sources who are? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you spend most of your time just counter arguing</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> is one of my favorite sites, let me put it that way. I don&#39;t do much arguing in there though, that&#39;s more like my choir most of the time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you actually come to your own conclusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not qualified to do that, but I&#39;d bet if you polled the most qualified people, I think they&#39;d say the number one problem for domestic honey bees are diseases and pests that plague them. Apiarists even employ pesticides themselves, which would probably surprise the appeal to nature crowd that&#39;s always arguing pesticides shouldn&#39;t even exist. </p>

<p>Headline® fungicide helps growers control diseases and improve overall Plant Health. That means potentially higher yields, better ROI and, ultimately, better profits. And that means more than just money in the bank. It can help secure a family&#39;s future, fund a college education, finance an equipment upgrade or maybe buy just a bit more of a vacation for the whole family. Perhaps that&#39;s why Headline fungicide is the nation&#39;s leading fungicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I confess to deliberately attracting them. I&#39;d say watermelon and squash top their list though, so I didn&#39;t really need to plant any flowers; bumblebees love the tomatoes, which don&#39;t even produce nectar. And then there&#39;s the 30 foot jacaranda which decided to bloom all summer this time; basically a giant flashing bee beacon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just bees either...I live out in a very rural and wooded part of Maine, USA. The bugs during the summer time are usually quite abundant. It&#39;s almost a shock this summer there are hardly any bugs at all. I would get a pile of dead June bugs by my flood lights weekly. This year I didn&#39;t see any but a few. Now, the region is witnessing a <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/07/05/maine-seeks-help-tracking-bat-colonies-as-die-off-continues/">die off in the bat population.</a></p>

<p>Every night in the summer time, my flood lights would attract a big swarm of bugs. The bats would feed off of the bug swarm like Tuna hitting a school of sardines...This year there&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s very eerie and a bit disturbing. I would say there is definitely something major going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve waited to put this somewhere so people will know so...I&#39;ve lived for 60 years in Boston and this is the first year ever there aren&#39;t any nighthawks making noise at dusk and after dark.  I heard one squawk 3 times about two months ago and not another one since. Onlne other people all over the US have asked the same question online.  What happened to them?  There isn&#39;t any good answer.  There isn&#39;t the usual amount noise from june bugs (buzzing in the trees), or katydids (click sound from trees), and I think they&#39;re late to arrive this year.  There are so few crickets and all this is scary.  I was out one night on a busy steet and there was just silence with a few crickets in the distance.  With all the street lights there should have been plenty of insects but there aren&#39;t.  Never before has this happened and it&#39;s just awful.</p>

<p>I thought of Monsanto, Fukishima, and maybe because this was supposed to be the year of locusts someone might have done something with pesticides to prevent them from coming out of the earth.  Or chemtrails?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the cause may be up for debate, but the quantifiable number of bees or their overall movement is alarming. If bees are the largest portion of insect pollination for our edible crops and they are disappearing, its a concern. The lack of scientific theory to reach an observation does not always mean the observation is inaccurate. </p>

<p>At the time of my posting OP didn&#39;t have the same post. It&#39;s been edited. So I was commenting on his VERY low effort post.  Now I seem like a jackass because he linked to Wikipedia in his edit. </p>

<p>Still super low effort but it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t agree with what he&#39;s trying to get across, I was only commenting on his lack of sources and effort. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t comment here often, I realize. I just don&#39;t like seeing posts that are so.. I don&#39;t know. Kinda simplistic. </p>
