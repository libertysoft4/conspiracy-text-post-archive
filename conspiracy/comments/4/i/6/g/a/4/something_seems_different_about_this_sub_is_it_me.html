    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I don&#39;t have a horse in this race...</p>

<p>If we could rewrite the script of &quot;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090305/">Weird Science</a>&quot; and create a leader of this current establishment; I fear they would be assassinated.</p>

<p>I am an old fashioned idealogue; who appreciates candid honesty, humble dedication &amp; realistic platforms. Rarely are these character traits found in politicians.</p>

<p>Our system is broken. A broken machine cannot really produce items without errors/problems.</p>

<p>Would Robert F Kennedy Jr run? I am not a democrat/republican, but many would assume lib/Dem if I throw out that name.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bealibertarian.com">John McAffee</a> is running, but he likes speed/meth/coca a little too much for me to be comfy with him.</p>

<p><a href="https://garyjohnson2016.com">Gary Johnson</a> is running, and he seems like a decent fella, but he has said some things over the past that produce pause for me.</p>

<p>We both know POTUS is just a person behind a desk in the oval office who gets intel &amp; is constantly struggling to appease more than they offend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain your views. If I had to choose I would choose Trump because he is a far better choice than Hillary and at this point that&#39;s who it seems it will come down to. </p>

<p>However, there are a lot of things that he says that make me rather apprehensive. For example, he basically said something along the lines of killing Snowden for being a traitor. That is a huge red flag for me. But, the thing I like the most about him is that he wants to put America first, which he could totally pull a Obama or Bush and make a 180 as soon as he gets in office.</p>

<p>In the end you are very correct in stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A broken machine cannot really produce items without errors/problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump only cares about himself. His business dealings and political behavior are proof positive - he&#39;ll say anything to get what he wants, then turns around and reneges once he&#39;s gotten it. I can&#39;t see any major miracle or come-to-Jesus moment that would change him suddenly should he become POTUS. Tigers don&#39;t change their stripes, and hucksters don&#39;t ever stop huckstering.</p>

<p>Edit: I was going to go find some examples and post them for you for illustration, but a Google on &quot;Trump&#39;s broken promises&quot; yields as many stories as &quot;Clinton&#39;s scandals.&quot; Voluminous and daunting - and, like Clinton, there&#39;s decades of it. But the info&#39;s out there if you want to go digging. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why more people in conspiracy aren&#39;t for Bernie.</p>

<p>Trump supporters that are strongly anti bernie seem to be either against bernie for flimsy reasons (flimsy arguments like bernie is for war or for israel--no he&#39;s not, on either); or they are very jingoistically / nationalistically anti-communist and so they conflate social democrat with communism and think bernie will put us all into gray prison uniforms at gattica style fema camps or something, when he really just wants to give everyone free healthcare and school and stop imprisoning people for smoking pot.  They attack supporters calling them &#39;bernie bots&#39; when honestly bernie supporters are far more informed than any other by my estimate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, it doesn&#39;t matter how smart you are.  They&#39;ll still fool you.  Or they won&#39;t but it won&#39;t matter because you won&#39;t have power unless you climb their ladders and become a player, which no one wants because it means committing a bunch of crimes along the way.</p>

<p>In fact, the smarter you are, the higher you generally go in education.  By the time you are at a PhD level you&#39;ve been inculcated into a cult of reasoning and thinking and knowledge that is very inflexible, so they&#39;ve got you.  What this ultimately means is that the smartest people are also the dumbest.  Are they going to invent anything?  No.  Inventors are almost always these outsiders who stopped college halfway because they realized it was horseshit and then they studied all sorts of things on their own and broke all the rules.  Invention is actually disruption, whereas phd culture is establishmentarianism and stasis.  I said almost always, please don&#39;t get on my case like a 20 yr old girl about generalities thank you</p>

So, we have misrepresentation there.

Your only proof of snowden being a limited hangout is that you&#39;re parroting others who are equally incorrect.  There has been and will be no proof of this, only conjecture, propaganda and taint.  The evidence has been &quot;why hasn&#39;t he released all the documents&quot;--clearly he&#39;s a hangout.</p>

<p>No, he needs to keep leverage.  Also, he doesn&#39;t leak stuff, Greenwald does.  If you saw his documentary you&#39;d understnad his reasons for slow leaking and they are valid, it would be too easy to do a media blackout if he released them all.</p>

<p>You would not be able to verify eschelon without snowden, nor would you know about xkeyscore, quantuminsert, the JTRIG forum spy documents, the social media manipulation &#39;sensemaking&#39; strategy, the extent to which stingrays are used and several ther projects that Snowden docs uniquely addressed.  Yes we were aware of mass surveillance efforts before snowden but the extent of them was not known.</p>

<p>You need to educate yourself before you start spouting nonsense.  Seriously, you need to focus specifically on how you&#39;re wrong about Snowden.  He IS a hero.  Say what you will of Sanders but you need to take back the Snowden remark because you&#39;re quite simply incorrect.</p>

<p>Bernie enthusiasm is not manufactured either.  I&#39;ve held &#39;honk for bernie&#39; signs.  No one mind-controlled me or paid me to do this.  The others with me were equally excited at a candidate that was different from any other in decades</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is often a confusion on here as to what a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; actually is.<br/>
Recently some guy posted a link to a webpage that explained the circumstances around the Irish Rebellion/Easter Rising of 1916. ..There was no actually conspiracy related to the article, it was basically a short, poorly written history lesson.<br/>
However when I asked why they were posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> i was downvoted and nobody wanted to provide a reason for it. (nobody else commented, just downvoted)  </p>

<p>I&#39;m still confused as to why they thought that was a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Not all posts @ r/conspiracy are &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some folks here have come to the conclusion that the Crown is a major player in the bankster/NWO/child sex abuse/masonic-whatever uber-conspiracy.  Hypothetically... and without getting too deep into the mysteries of the Catholic church... the Easter Rising is an example of a failure in that conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Either that or NWO-paid astroturfers are trying to plant fear porn into the minds of Irish and Irish Americans by reminding them of their oppression.  They want that famous Irish temper to be the spark.   </p>

People on here love to throw &quot;shill&quot; around, like if you disagree with something that gets posted in Conspiracy you&#39;re automatically a government paid agent hell bent on suppressing the masses. It&#39;s counterproductive to this sub. </p>

<p>That&#39;s sure a nice way to describe the rampant shilling.  It&#39;s all because people disagree that the shill label is applied?  I&#39;m afraid not.  Stick around long enough, and you&#39;ll see certain individuals responsible for posting apologist lies and attacks who strictly cover a short list of very blatant subjects.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4i6ga4/something_seems_different_about_this_sub_is_it_me/d2w3gs9">Link</a></p>

<p>I know how often I seek out people who discuss things that I don&#39;t care for, just so I can set them all straight, REPEATEDLY - every single time its brought up, while exclusively utilizing well documented <a href="https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">forum disruption tactics</a>.  Perfectly normal behavior that must just innocently mirror the methods and purpose of shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It most certainly is.  To believe that just by dumb luck EVERY SINGLE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT (minus 1) is directly related to John &quot;Lackland&quot; Plantagenet, King of England (1166 - 1216).  Yeah, not a soul on this sub has ANY relation to old John here in their genealogy, yet the shills will claim up and down that being related to him is somehow common.</p>

<p>They told us the US won it&#39;s freedom through the revolutionary war.  That French bankers &quot;helped&quot; bankroll it.  Yet as soon as we won, we couldn&#39;t arrange full debt payment to the loser King of England fast enough.  The victor seldom if ever pays his debts to the loser of the war.</p>
