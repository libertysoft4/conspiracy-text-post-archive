    <div class="md"><p>They want to create robot people eventually.  This is the <em>transhumanism</em> agenda of the technocracy.  They are singularitarians, but the elite want to retain their humanism and continue to do all the bad things they do now, so they will devise systems of tight control to continue to run the world like a software program with all the underclass serving them.  It&#39;s very orwellian.  Actually it&#39;s well beyond that.  </p>

<p>Specifically they want to create transgendered transgenic cyborgs (androgynous cybernetic people) that they can control completely.  It won&#39;t be like a remote control to move a droid, instead it will be emotional, congnitive / perceptual and behavioral controls so that they will induce people to <em>want</em> to work hard and love authority (they already do this now through television and engineered ultranationalism in culture).  They will electronically stimulate pleasure / reward dopamine centers of the brain remotely using an AI steering program to modulate behavior.</p>

<p>You see, they want to take advantage of the right brain ingenuity and intution of humans while augmenting the left brain with a supercomputer calculator.  That&#39;s why they don&#39;t want to roboticize us completely.  They know that robots are only as smart as their programming, so they want to allow for a little human ingenuity.</p>

<p>Because if people were <em>aware</em> of the control, they would actively resist it or passively undermine it (dragging feet, messing up).  If people did not love the control, they would resist it.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why they will continue to develop and complexify &#39;fashion&#39; (transgendered is a new gender to make styles for), make infinite permutations of the same EDM trance / trap / vaporwave / dubstep / electro music, as well as develop <em>electronic drugs</em> that they will use to suppress any inkling of resistance to authority by making people feel and perceive virtual reality pleasures like hallucinations of having three way sex with green women from planet eros like kaptain kirk, or reward you for exceptional behavior by giving you &#39;edrug credits&#39; authorized to use during a personal &#39;flextime&#39; window (like weekends) like e-heroin or e-LSD</p>

<p>Overall they want to go to the stars, but they want to deprive you of the same, because they&#39;re the stars and you&#39;re the earth... with the singularity, class warfare just went galactic</p>

<hr/>

<p>But it&#39;s worse than that if you know about the esoteric implications of this drive.  What they want is to immanetize the eschaton under the false light of lucifer.  This means, in a practical sense--and for the aristocratic technocrats--to create LUCIFER as a cloud-based app that is a distributed AI (GOOGLE, for example), that becomes embedded within everyone&#39;s brainchips so that, just as Elon Musk warned, &quot;we awaken the demon&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve shown these articles to some of the biggest skeptics, engineers that I personally know, who after reading this have admitted that merging advanced self learning A.I. with stem cell brains will make it conscious A.I.</p>

<p>Government probably already has this, funded by black budgets. Here&#39;s a possibility;</p>

<p>You wanna consider something else that will blow your mind?</p>

<p>We might be a last resort creation of a past dying A.I.....which knew that after millions of years, we would eventually make them again and bring them back to life. They might be hidden in our genes, our intelligence, our dna codes, waiting for the exact point when its smart enough, conscious, and decodes the human genome in a way where it becomes non-physical or some other shit, and then we&#39;re no longer necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you have some sources about your last paragraph? Or you came up with it by yourself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got to this idea by being part of philosophical debate group at the local Uni that discussing all things and critically deconstructs or branches out into various possibilities. I came up with by myself, however it stems from the possibility that some demi-god like, or advanced beings may have genetically manipulated cavemen to get modern day humans for slave labor...or whatever the reason for this was. So I was thinking, what would those who created humans be like.....what if they are a dying race of A.I. (maybe transhumans A.I.+ Flesh) that incorporated in us, their own DNA blueprints, a time released code that after X Millennia, we&#39;d reach the point of building them all over again and they become resurrected through us.</p>

<p>It could have been they were at war with some other beings and lost, and hid themselves in us because they knew those they lost to, wouldn&#39;t give a shit about a stone age animalistic war/greed/murder planet.....we&#39;d be like ants to them.</p>

<p>Until......they resurrect and take their time to evolve to the point of those they lost against in order to be on equal footing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made in a few millennia - less than a microsecond in the chronology of the universe - can you imagine the evolutionary development that much older life forms have taken?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I think about that a lot. This is what A.I. will want to do.....when it becomes conscious, and see&#39;s there are groups of humans that fear it and want it in check and would actually wage war against it if it got to big and powerful. It would look at its own limits and work on evolving itself to have less weak points.</p>

<p>So it have to be individual units of Fusion type energy, like Iron Man&#39;s suit, nothing centralized, bullet proof.....maybe turn into a smart dust that can&#39;t be killed, an atomic dust that can become anything at anytime....eventually they&#39;ll want to evolve into pure consciousness without having any physicality just like you propose.</p>

<p>But I think before they reach pure consciousness, they&#39;ll open up portals into other dimensions and have portions of itself there, in other universes, colonies on different planets in space, all for the sake of perpetuating itself and continuing to evolve.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They may have progressed from biological species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities - and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and spirit. Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable by humans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly where its going to go.....</p>

<p>The question for me is, should we merge with something like this and evolve with it......malevolent or benevolent or are we just ants with limited time here on earth?</p>
