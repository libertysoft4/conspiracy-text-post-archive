If a few people think your a dick, maybe its them, but if EVERYONE thinks you&#39;re a dick the problem is you.</p>

<p>Many non jews have never read the talmud. I have. There is a public misconception that it is a &quot;religious text&quot; when in reality it is a code of laws that governs day to day living. Not a jew? Than its okay to steal from you, kill you, rape you or your children and take from you whatever the &quot;chosen&quot; wish. This is not &quot;spin&quot; this is fact. I encourage all of you to read it sometime.</p>

<p>With such a militant, xenophobic doctrine guiding their people is it any wonder they are persona non grata everywhere? Whats the last ethnic group that had to have military intervention create a homeland for them? Only one I can think of.</p>

<p>Now dont conflate ALL jewish for the orthodox jews that ascribe to the talmud. There are many kind compassionate jewish that oppose the palestinian genoicide, the constant ad hominem bombs hurled at any of those who dare question the &quot;victim mythology&quot; unfortunately they are treated as &quot;self hating traitors&quot; to &quot;their people&quot; </p>

<p>I am curious to see what the cognoscenti of reddit think of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget the Talmud - have you ever read the Old Testament?</p>

<p>Where did the name &quot;Israel&quot; come from? The Old Testament tells us that, in order to marry his daughter, a Jewess, Jacob demanded that some tribe get circumcised. So, they agreed.</p>

<p>Then, while they were all healing from having the tips of their dicks cut off, the Jews snuck into the town and murdered them all, then raped their wives and daughters.</p>

<p>The Jew tribe was so ... er ... &quot;unpopular&quot; ... after this, they changed their name from &quot;Jacob&quot; to &quot;Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the Bible folks, just read it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK upon further investigation the Hebrew word that was translated as rape actually means &quot;subd7e&quot; so jews who have always despised intermarrying (israel today has a national snitch line for those that date outside the faith) saw a goy being the object of his daughters love and concluded  rape, makes much more sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another group of scholars bases their interpretations on source criticism and so neglects the rape. For instance, Yair Zakovitch applies this method to reconstructing the earliest version of Genesis 34. Particularly one observation leads him to exclude the rape from the original literary source of the text. He states: “The sequence of actions at the beginning of the story is difficult: Shechem lay with the girl and ravished her (verse 2), and only afterward became infatuated with her and sought to persuade her (verse 3).” [6] Thus, to Zakovitch, later editors added the rape in verse 2b to justify the brothers. The editors needed a motive for the murder, which the rape provided. Zakovitch also proposes that the editors wanted to assimilate the original story to two biblical texts: the story of the rape of Tamar (2 Samuel 13) and Jacob’s curse of his two sons (Genesis 49:5-7). Accordingly, the changes resulted in a contrived version in which rape explains the fraternal violence. In contrast, the original story did not contain “the rape element”. It reported only “Shechem’s innocent attraction to Dinah and Jacob’s sons’ treacherous exploitation of the situation in order to plunder the city”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall that this event was the Tribe of Benjamin, not Judah. It was the sisters of the small tribe of Benjamin who, facing death at the hands of a conqueror, agreed to let the invaders marry their sisters if they would be circumcised. So... Israelites of Benjamin, not Judah. Furthermore, these womenfolk being the sisters and daughter of the Benjaminites, after killing the circumcised invaders, they would not be raping their own sisters and daughters.

    <div class="md"><p>The zionist jews who reside in Israel are constantly fed holocaust propaganda and on top of this they have military check points everywhere for security.</p>

<p>They&#39;re being used as much as you, I know thats hard to believe, but the problem is that they are easier to manipulate/use since they shove holocaust propaganda down their throats to justify anything from increasing security, building walls, having army patrol 24/7.</p>

<p>The zionist jewish oligarchy that rules the country want this kind of tyrannical model everywhere, thats why France is going through the process and why America is basically finished in terms of setting up a police state.</p>

<p>In order to have the same model they need to scare the population into it and this is where the refugee crisis comes in. The powers that be already know they&#39;re declining in terms of power, so they need to stop playing the good guys domestically sooner or later.</p>

<p>Having been to Israel, the place is actually a shithole for jews. The wealth gap between rich jews and the rest is higher than in western countries.<a href="https://en.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/4idmng/a_message_and_apology/"> If you want to actually have a family and peaceful state of mind as a jew, you wouldn&#39;t live there anyway</a></p>

<p>I recommend watching some Gilad Atzmon lectures, he&#39;s actually a jew who goes through everything related to anti-semitism and jewish elite power.</p>

I am one of these jews you speak of -- against Palestinian genocide, against Israel as country and an idea, and against communism in all forms. I will be honest, I don&#39;t know how many like myself exist, my father is a staunch Zionist and bases who he will vote on for president based on how much they cuck for Israel. I try to educate my mother on the crimes of Israel, she doesn&#39;t really care. It doesn&#39;t affect her so no matter how passionately I plea; she really can&#39;t even try to care. It&#39;s very sad, she&#39;s a beautiful person too, but very apolitical and non-ideological. But yeah, I know there aren&#39;t many like me, but I promise we exist. Peace be with you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I ask how you perceive Trump&#39;s speech at AIPAC? I really don&#39;t know how to read it. My first impression was that it shows he is no more than a slave to the Jewish cabal, but when I said that a few times in posts on this sub, people attacked me like I was crazy. Now -- I really don&#39;t know how to read it because much of what Trump wants to do goes against Jewish power, but when he speaks to AIPAC he speaks of how he wants to destroy Iran, which is their exact playbook. Why does he want to destroy Iran if he&#39;s not a pawn of the Jews? That&#39;s what they can&#39;t explain to me, the Trump supporters. He follows the script of a Greater Israel, and that&#39;s how I feel. thoughts?</p>

<p>If a few people think your a dick, maybe its them, but if EVERYONE thinks you’re a dick the problem is you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We jews, we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers. We will forever destroy, because we need a world of our own. <strong>– Maurice Samuel</strong>, <em>You Gentiles</em></p>

<p>Anti-Semitism is nothing but the antagonistic attitude produced in the non-Jews by the Jewish group or individual. This is a normal social reaction.
<strong>– Albert Einstein</strong></p>

<p>I am well aware of the tactics of you, my Zionist brethren, use to quiet anyone who attempts to expose any of your subversive acts. If the person is a Gentile, you cry, “You’re anti-semitic!” which is nothing more than a smokescreen to hide your actions. But, if a Jew is the person doing the exposing, you resort to other tactics. First, you ignore the charges, hoping the information will not be given widespread distribution. If the information starts reaching too many people, you ridicule the information and the persons giving the information. If that doesn&#39;t work, your next step is character assassination. If the author or speaker hasn&#39;t been involved in sufficient scandal you are adept at fabricating scandal against the person or persons. If none of these are effective, you are known to resort to physical attacks. But, NEVER do you try to prove the information wrong.</p>

<p>So, before you start your efforts to quiet me, I offer this challenge:</p>

<p>You Zionists assemble a number of Zionist Jews and witnesses to support your position; and I will assemble a like number of anti-Zionist, pro-American Jews and witnesses. Then, the Zionists and the Anti-Zionists will state their position and debate the material in this book as well as related material — the debate to be held on public television. Let’s explore the information and let the American people decide for themselves if the information is true or false. Isn’t that a fair challenge?</p>

<p>Certainly, you will willingly accept the challenge if what I have written is false. But, if you resort to crying, “Lies, all lies,” and refuse to debate the material you will, in effect, be telling the American people that what I have written are the true facts.
<strong>– Jack Bernstein</strong>, <em>The Life of an American Jew in Racist, Marxist Israel</em></p>

<p>Now don’t conflate ALL jewish for the orthodox jews that ascribe to the talmud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. Wondered if anybody would go this direction. Before the Khazars, a jewish high priest robbed the tomb of king David and used the loot to buy an army. He conquered the Edomites (condemned by God) and they flooded Judah. Here is a short bit from the Jewish Encyclopedia: &quot;With funds which he is said to have obtained from David&#39;s sepulcher he hired foreign troops, dismantled Adora and Marissa, the strong places of Edom, and forced the Edomites to accept the Jewish religion and submit to circumcision. This is the first instance of forcible conversion in Jewish history. In this Hyrcanus allowed his zeal for the Jewish cause to lead him to take a step which later wrought harm&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the Jews were half Edomite long before the Khazars. Today&#39;s Jews are so mixed and watered down, there is little or no Judaic Hebrew blood in them at all.</p>

<p>The majority of the real tribe of Judah split and rejoined the lost tribes who&#39;d fled to western Europe and the British Isles. Judah = Jutland and the Jutes. That&#39;s one tribe accounted for.</p>

<p>So if the people who call themselves Jews are not of Hebrew origin, then they did not descend from Shem and are by definition NOT Semetic. They&#39;re anything but Semitic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism well predates &quot;anti semitism&quot; Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must “vanish” before the state of Israel can be formed. “You shall return minus 6 million.” That’s why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the “6 million” is an attempt to transform the Holocaust story into state religion. Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in “burning ovens”, which the judicial version of the Holocaust now authenticates. As a matter of fact, Robert B. Goldmann writes: “. . . without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.” A simple consequence: Given six million Jews gassed at Auschwitz who ended up in the “burning ovens” (the Greek word holocaust means burned offerings), therefore, the prophecies have now been “fulfilled” and Israel can become a “legitimate state”. –Unknown 
[Quote 2] Regarding the ‘six million’ number you should know the following: In the Hebrew text of the Torah prophesies, one can read “you shall return”. In the text the letter “V” or “VAU” is absent, as Hebrew does not have any numbers; the letter V stands for the number 6. Ben Weintraub, a religious scientist, learned from rabbis that the meaning of the missing letter means the number is ‘6 million’. The prophesy then reads: You will return, but with 6 million less. See Ben Weintraub: “The Holocaust Dogma of Judaism”, Cosmo Publishing, Washington 1995, page 3. The missing 6 million must be so before the Jews can return to the Promised Land. Jahweh sees this as a cleaning of the souls of the sinful people. The Jews must, on the return to the Promised Land, be clean — the cleaning shall be done in burning stokes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first example of ritual Jewish cannibalism is the hamentashen eaten on the Purim holiday. Jewish children learn that the triangular pastry is a replica of the triangular hat worn by Hamen, the arch enemy of the Jewish people. The truth is that the pastry is actually meant to look like Hamen&#39;s ear, not his hat. These pastries are filled with poppy seeds, apricots, chocolates, and other sweets, but many Jews throughout history also filled these pastries with the flesh, fat, and blood of local gentile children kidnapped and murdered in a ritual sacrifice of revenge.</p>

<p>Second, the afikomen. This special matzah is hidden during the Passover seder. After the ceremonial meal the children of the home seek out and find the hidden piece of unlevened bread, they return it to their father for a reward, and then everyone eats it for dessert. All fun and games, right?</p>

<p>No. This ritual is symbolic of the tenth plague: the slaying of the first born. Jews teach their children that &quot;God&quot; killed the Egyptian pharaoh&#39;s first born as a punishment for not releasing the slaves. This is not entirely true. Jews also teach that God works through the actions of men. The Israelites were the real perpetrators of the mass killing of all Egyptian first born children.</p>

<p>This includes Egyptian children born to women in Jews&#39; own homes. Most slave families of that era had at least one child in their household fathered by the Egyptians. This is symbolized by the vacant seat at the seder table, the plate of uneaten food, and the feigned ignorance of the whereabouts of its intended occupant, &quot;Elijiah.&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s the truth? The male Jewish head of household murdered his stepson, baked his flesh into the matzah, put his blood into the 4 cups of red wine drank at the seder, and rejoiced in the murder of the innocent child of the pharaoh. Jewish children are ritually trained to hunt, kill, and eat non-Jewish children at an early age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not knowing too much about this subject, I&#39;d be apt to call bullshit on these stories. <em>However</em>, it&#39;s undeniable that Judeo-Christian religions still observe these types of behaviors - for example, the ceremony of sucking the blood of a child&#39;s newly cut foreskin and the ritualistic eating of the savior&#39;s body and blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The jewish repeatedly distinguish between &quot;their god&quot; and the god of the bible, because their God is saturn, aka chronos,aka satan. Hence the Sabbath on Saturn&#39;s day and the black cube hats they wear. Is it really hate speech to rail against practicing satanists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order to see the big picture when it comes to zionist one must be very well read. If you haven&#39;t read the talmud, you won&#39;t understand how the pharisees bragged about killing jesus, or how goyim are a burden to them as a matter of their very existance. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read the kybalion you won&#39;t get the false flags, scapegoating and victim narrative.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read the the creature from jekyll island you don&#39;t know all the world Bank financiers are jewish.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read  the protocols of the elders of zion you don&#39;t get just how long and hard the entirety of the jewish power structure has devoted their efforts towards these goals.</p>

<p>Any of these things individually, while compelling can get you accused of being a racist or bigot. But when you know all the answers because you&#39;ve done the work, no one can refute the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent thread. I wish more people would discuss this.   </p>

<p>All the talk about ISIS, Federal Reserve, banksters, illegal wars around the world are all symptoms of the parasite. Don&#39;t take Aspirin for the fever, instead work to remove the parasitic worm that is rotting human civilization from within: the Zionist jews.  </p>

<p>But be careful in doing this because if you go a step deeper than blaming the banks and &quot;elites&quot; than you&#39;ll be labeled an anti-parasite. </p>
