    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about the delay.</p>

<p>Here is an article that gets into the debates needing to be sanctioned and how participants in unsanctioned debates will not be allowed to participate in future presidential debates if they win the nomination</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sorry-bernie-sanders-no-inter-party-primary-debate-for-you/article/2565521">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sorry-bernie-sanders-no-inter-party-primary-debate-for-you/article/2565521</a></p>

<p>Quote from the article:</p>

<p>&quot;The Republican National Committee did not mince words, telling the Washington Examiner there would be no such debates.</p>

<p>&#39;The RNC has made clear that if any Republican candidate participates in an unsanctioned debate they will not be allowed to take part in any of the other RNC sanctioned primary debates,&#39; RNC spokesman James Hewitt said.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is some more info on the Commission on Presidential Debates (sorry for wiki)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates</a></p>

<p>And here is an article on why this very commission is being sued and being accused of blocking 3rd parties from being able to participate in the sanctioned debates</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/romney-obama-join-forces-in-lawsuit-against-debate-commission/article/2580665">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/romney-obama-join-forces-in-lawsuit-against-debate-commission/article/2580665</a></p>

<p>Here is an article from a few months ago when Cruz tried to get Trump into a 1 v 1 unsanctioned debate</p>

<p><a href="https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/01/what-are-the-penalties-if-trump-and-cruz-debate">https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/01/what-are-the-penalties-if-trump-and-cruz-debate</a></p>

<p>It looks like the rule they site was update in 2014</p>

<p><a href="https://gop.com/rnc-approves-debate-rul/">https://gop.com/rnc-approves-debate-rul/</a></p>

<p>&quot; Proposed Amendment to Rule 10</p>

<p>Insert the following as section (h):
There shall be a Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates, which shall be composed of thirteen (13) members of the Republican National Committee, five (5) of whom shall be appointed by the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and each of the four (4) regions shall elect two (2) members, one man and one woman, at its regional caucus at the RNC Summer Meeting in each even-numbered year in which no Presidential election is held. The chairman of the Republican National Committee shall appoint the chairman of the Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates from among the members thereof. The Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates shall have the authority to sanction debates on behalf of the Republican National Committee based on input from presidential campaigns and criteria which may include but are not limited to considerations of timing, frequency, format, media outlet, and the best interests of the Republican Party. Each debate sanctioned by the Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates shall be known as a &quot;Sanctioned Debate.&quot; Any presidential candidate who participates in any debate that is not a Sanctioned Debate shall not be eligible to participate in any further Sanctioned Debates. &quot;</p>

<p>The intellectual loafers know very well that Karl Marx manipulated Hegel’s “metaphysical dialectic” in order to elaborate that deceptive “dialectical materialism.” Evidently, Karl Marx took from Hegel’s work all the metaphysical principles that Hegel gave to his work, and with the leftovers Karl Marx elaborated his deceptive dish. Thus, it is not irrelevant to repeat in this lecture that Marx, as the author of such a lie, of such a farce, of such Communistic dialectic, never believed in it, and therefore he did not have any inconvenience in confessing his feelings in the heat of the assembly when saying, <strong>“Gentlemen, I am not Marxist.”</strong></p>

He spent the days leading up to this saying he would love to debate Bernie any time.  Then Bernie agrees, so trump says only if they raise $10 million for Women&#39;s charity.  They called his bluff so he backed out knowing he was going to get stomped in front of everyone.</p>

<p>Trump is a fool though, and he didn&#39;t realize until later that he was entering a lose/lose with Sanders.  He needs to pull Sanders supporters for the general, but if he plays nice his own supporter base will call him weak for not yelling down &quot;the commie&quot;.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s an issue that most people have no understanding of, and would have him attacked even more as being &quot;out of touch&quot; or even delusional.</p>

<p>This is not a vote-winning issue.  I have no idea what he thinks about this but either way, he&#39;s quite right to do nothing before he&#39;s elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so Trump speaks of it, and gets called countless names, attacked all the time. I&#39;m not telling you to vote Trump or anything but damn, admit when I have a point. Bernie even backed off Hillary&#39;s emails... I like what Bernie represents but if he wanted the nomination he should have attacked Clinton sooner. Trump has been the presumptive nominee for what, 3 weeks? he&#39;s already unloaded on Clinton 10 times what Bernie has... </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even calling Bernie chicken. I&#39;m not 10 years old. my point is, hold both him and Trump to the same standards. if Bernie did talk about auditing the fed like Trump has, you would be praising him (and rightly so IMO). but for you to bend your reasoning to support Bernie no matter what he does, that&#39;s a problem. </p>
