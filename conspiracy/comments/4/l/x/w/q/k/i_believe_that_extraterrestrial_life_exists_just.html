    <div class="md"><p>My belief is slightly different.  I think the UFO phenomenon is undeniable.  There are crafts flying around here that are not publicly identifiable.  I just don&#39;t think these crafts are inhabited by ET&#39;s.</p>

<p>I also think differently from you about other planets, but this is a little further out there.  I think the only surface in the universe that you can stand on and live and thrive is right here on earth.   I do not subscribe to the idea that the &quot;planets&quot; and stars floating around in our sky are physical bodies that can be traveled to.  </p>

<p>This takes a bit more explaining, but to stick to your initial point, when you look at the big proponents of the ET search you get organizations like the Rockefeller foundation.  The ET phenomenon is just too convenient in covering up other narratives that I have since began to suspect are false.</p>

<p>I am getting way ahead of myself, but in summary, IMO there is such thing as higher intelligence.  ET&#39;s that evolved on distant planets and came here to see what&#39;s up with us?  Not so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The planets in our solar system may perhaps be spherical.  I think that much could be true, but I do not think you or I could stand on Mars for instance, and I certainly don&#39;t believe that there are rovers driving around there.</p>

<p>My belief comes from my recent fascination with the concave earth hypothesis.  I had been exploring it and trying to grasp it and once I did I realized that it explains the observational qualities of our universe equally well if not better than the Copernican hypothesis.  </p>

<p>It also explains why there are no experiments that demonstrate the movement of the Earth. (rotation or revolution around the Sun)  It also explains the seemingly recent rise of the flat earth discussion, and it also explains why NASA&#39;s earth pictures all contradict each other and look fake.</p>

<p>Then I found this documentary: <a href="https://gwwdvd.com/">https://gwwdvd.com/</a> and it changed the game for me.  I unfortunately could not find a free version, but I rented it and it is probably the best thing I have watched in years.</p>

<p>The conclusions of this documentary are staggering, but I think it misses the mark slightly.  </p>

<p>They conclude that the universe is in perfect balance such that the Earth is the center of gravity of the entire universe which is why we cannot measure it&#39;s movement.  The sun in their model is still more massive, but it is tied up in the gravity of all the other galaxies in perfect balance so that the Earth remains still and the entire universe rotates around it.  </p>

<p>They provide proof from the very mouths of famous heliocentrists like Galileo, Einstein, Newton, etc. and their model is appearedly backed by sound science, but I think there is a simpler explanation.</p>

<p>Instead of assuming that the massive and infinite universe all whirls around us, I find it more easy to believe that the earth is a shell and we live on the inside.  The universe is spherical and it rotates within this shell.  Gravity is a push outwards from the center of this sphere and light arcs towards the center as illustrated <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/horizon-tent.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Concave_hollow_Earths.svg/536px-Concave_hollow_Earths.svg.png">here.</a>  In this sense, the <em>heavens</em> (heavenly bodies) are directly above the heads of each and every person on earth.</p>

<p>This explains why we can see boats that are further away than we should be able to on a convex ball, but they still disappear bottom first.  This also explains how the sun and moon would set appearedly bottom first.</p>

<p>Then there is Cyrus Teed and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreshan_Unity">Koreshan Unity</a> who endorsed this model in the 1800s who invented the Koreshan Premise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A straight line extended at right angles from a perpendicular post will meet the surface of the earth at a distance proportionate to the height of the perpendicular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The experiment became called the <a href="https://www.floridamemory.com/fpc/KOR/KOR2141.jpg">rectilineator</a> and it has been reproduced many times since then.</p>

<p>in 1982 an Egyptian Mathematician by the name of Abdelkader actually created a working mathematical model for the inside out universe in which he uses the simple concept of <a href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt668/emat6680.f99/challen/inversion/index.html">inverting the circle</a> to model the cosmos.  I actually used his idea to calculate the altitude and speed of the ISS using the concave hypothesis in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4l149x/what_is_the_moon/d3l28u8">this comment</a></p>

<p>Basically the concave hypothesis is equally as useful in modelling our universe as the Copernican hypothesis.  When you add the bogus NASA photos and the rectilineator it causes me to lean towards concave.</p>

<p>I do not expect any reader to take my word for it, but I would invite anyone to give the model a chance to sink in and then just consider the world in both contexts and I think you will find that the concave hypothesis is preferable.  It places us inside a closed system similar to our mother&#39;s womb rather than a random accident hurling through an infinite vacuum.  Instead of the stars being millions of light years away, they are close and they were put there for us by someone who didn&#39;t leave things up to chance.  </p>

<p>I am not a religious person.  I am not trying to will this hypothesis to be true.  If anything I wanted space to be real because I wanted to contact aliens.  But the fact is somewhere along the journey it dawned on me that this is a better explanation of our universe than anything I have come across.  I implore you to do your own research and I am happy to elaborate on what I have said.  I am still trying to get my hands on Abdelkader&#39;s full works and once I do I will do a full write up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that surprised me!</p>

<p>Would you say all other properties arc toward the center and perhaps change in scale too? Meaning, we have sent satellites further from Earth than 6370km, and that would require the space to condense the closer to the center you go, and time to slow down, and so on, so that it appears that the satellite or anything has actually traveled as far as we think.</p>

<p>There are also geosynchronous satellites that can be viewed at night and for them to stay in place in the sky means they have to be around 42k km away.</p>

<p>Btw, checking how large something should look is simple trigonometry, &quot;atan((diameter of object / 2) / (distance to object)) * 2&quot; gives the angular size. Edit: divide the size by two and later multiply is because otherwise the triangle would not be a right triangle. But you can split the actual viewing triangle in half which makes two right triangles.</p>

<p>If you came to the conclusion ISS is on the exact orbit it should be, which you can check quick from someones photograph against moon and calculate it&#39;s angular size, it might not mean anything bad for your theory if everything would &quot;condense&quot; the closer to the center you go.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I will be back with some questions =)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes!  That is impressive intuitive thinking.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have Abdelkaders work, but I have skeptical commentary by Gardner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After  inverting  the cosmos,  Abdelkader  then  applies  the same  inversion  to all the laws of  physics.  The result  is a consistent  physics that  cannot  be falsified  by any conceivable  observation  or  experiment!  Of course the  equations  for the laws  become  horribly  complex.  Light  rays  follow circular  arcs,  the velocity  of light  goes  to zero  as it  approaches  the center  of inversion,  and all  sorts  of  other  bizarre  modifications  of laws  are required.  </p>

<p>To an observer  in  this inverted  universe  everything  looks  and  measures  exactly  the  same  as in the  Copernican  model,  even  though  the heavenly  bodies  become  minuscule.  Day  and night,  eclipses,  and the orbits  of the  sun, moon,  and  planets-every  thing-can  be explained by  suitably  inverted  laws. Instead  of the  earth  rotating,  the shrunken  celestial  bodies  revolve the  opposite  way around  the earth’s  “axis.”  Because  light  follows  curved  paths,  the sun seems  to set as  usual  below  the “horizon”  as it  travels  a conical  helix,  six months  in one direction  and  six  months  in the  other.  The  Foucault  pendulum,  Coriolis  effects,  and other inertial “proofs”  of the  earth ‘s rotation  are all accounted  for by the  drastically  modified  laws.  </p>

<p><strong>Could  you  confirm  the theory  by taking  off in  a spaceship  to  see if  you  would  quickly  reach the  other  side  by following  a  diameter  of the  sphere?  No,  because  the closer  you got  to the  center  of inversion  the smaller  your ship  would  become  and  the  slower  it would  move.</strong> You  would soon  find  yourself  traveling  through  what  would  appear  to be vast  galaxies.  If the universe  before  inversion  was  open  and infinite,  you  would  never  reach  the  center.  It would  be a singularity  at which  your size  and  speed  would  be zero,  and  time  would stop completely.  Of course  you  could  avoid  the singularity  and  get to the other  side.  but the  trip  would  take  as long  as traveling  to the outer  edge  of an expanding  Copernican  universe,  and back  again.  The  fastest  way  to get to the  other  side  would  be to fly around  the inner  surface of  the hollow  earth.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s how the &quot;inverting the circle&quot; equation wore works, because no matter how far away any point p&#39; is outside the circle, the point p inside the circle must be smaller than the square of the radius of the circle, so p will never reach the value of r which means it will never reach the center of the circle.  In Cyrus Teeds and Abdelkader&#39;s model they both accounted for a center sphere that was of more considerable size than just a singularity so that was subtracted from the radius of their models.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, thought it would make no sense without such thing, but with that inversion it does at least first sound like it would work out.</p>

<p>Why do you think this model is probable?</p>

<p>In your original post you said it would explain the lack of studies of Earth&#39;s movements, for example rotation around the Sun. If the Earth was hollow and it was the Sun that is moving I think it should be easy to check it by shining something powerful towards the Sun and checking the reflection. If the Sun moves, the point where you would need to aim the beam would be in front of the apparent movement, in other words take a lead, but if it is the Earth going around the Sun you would not need to lead the beam (almost) at all. At least now I don&#39;t see how the arcing or scaling (inverting) would affect the situation.</p>

<p>Another question I started to think is would you see the other side of the Milky way from the other side of the planet? As the Milky way is visible from either side of the planet, it would need to be a thin sphere before the next closest galaxy and so on, but how would it be formed if it would look just like it does? It&#39;s easy to think you would see the &quot;backside&quot; of it by going to the opposite side of the planet, but if not, then I cannot wrap my head around how it and the rest of the universe would be layed out.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess I&#39;m quite skeptical about the theory, but it is interesting. Don&#39;t take me as trying to only shoot you down, I&#39;m trying to understand how a model like that could work, but at the same time of course I raise the questions that seem the most obvious to me that would break it. Though, if someone has really put thought into it, it&#39;s probably me not understanding how it works and probably it would look identical to the accepted model where the Earth is not hollow.</p>

<p>Does the theory talk about what is beyond the surface of the Earth? Nothing? With the inverting, scaling whatever you would call it, digging down would mean you would start moving faster and faster as you become bigger and bigger, so I&#39;d guess it&#39;s ground to infinity.</p>

<p>I am not sure how this would prove anything.  Concave, convex, moving, or non moving, the apparent relative motion of the sun would be the same.  Maybe I am not understanding your point, but I don&#39;t think this would be conclusive.</p>

<p>The part you are struggling with is the part that I had the hardest time dealing with as well.  </p>

<p>Remember that the light would bend towards the center, so you wouldn&#39;t be able to see through the center and on to the back of of a galaxy on the other end of the sphere.  See if <a href="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/whatcuriosityinthestructure-hollowearthinscience-100502151904-phpapp01/95/what-curiosity-in-the-structure-hollow-earth-in-science-42-728.jpg?cb=1272813577">this image</a> helps.</p>

<p>I am not quite understanding where you are confused, but remember that in this model that space is spherical and rotating.  In the northern hemisphere you would see the north celestial pole and in the southern hemisphere, the southern celestial pole.  Equatorial constellations would be rotating daily so in 6 month intervals you would see different constellations in the sky just like in the Copernican model.  I hesitate to bring up this source because he is so easily dismissed based on his character and beliefs beyond the concave hypothesis, but Steven Christopher does have a pretty good virtual depiction of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xypm-XKw4_A&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">how the planets and stars would move.</a></p>

<p>In order for the models to work, most proponents suggest that there is spherically shaped glass holding in the cosmos, and within this sphere is water.  I am unsure exactly why it must be filled with water, but the glass in the sky phenomenon does explain how we are able to see circular rainbows outdoors, but not indoors with out an additional reflector.</p>

<p>Yes, Abdelkader uses his same theory to suggest that a drill bit would get larger and move faster but I personally do not subscribe to that idea.  The deepest we have ever been able to dig is about 12km and then we mysteriously cannot go any further.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">Kola Superdeep Borehole</a> drill reached it&#39;s maximum depth of 12km in 1989, but then failed to make any more progress in the next three years and they gave up in 1992.  I think it is more likely that there is a limit to our world.  If I am being honest this phenomenon doesn&#39;t make sense in the convex hypothesis either.   </p>

<p>I will need to track down a source on this but it is rumored that Hitler was a convex hypothesis guy, and he viewed the universe as a series of systems of caverns much like swiss cheese.  Apparently he believed he could somehow reach another system through the poles.  Some posit that he was successful, and he left his main propaganda agents behind (through project paperclip) to take over NASA and space travel to cover his tracks.</p>

<p>I think the most complete model is Cyrus Teeds, and he wrote a book called &quot;The Cellular Cosmogony: Earth is a Concave Sphere, with Proof&quot; that I am currently reading.  Smarter people than I have admitted that his model is empirically indistinguishable using optical experiments.  </p>

<p>If I am completely missing the mark on any of my responses maybe you could frame your question a different way?</p>

<p>The experiment that fucks up the Copernincan model and suggests that the Earth does not move is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">Michelson &amp; Morley</a> experiment and it is difficult to reconcile with a moving Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The relative motion would be the same between the Sun and the Earth no matter the model, but the effects of shining a say a laser to the Sun behaves different depending on which is orbiting which, which one is the one moving. As light has a delay of 8min from Sun to Earth, if it was the Sun moving, we would see in the sky the Sun at a position that is where it &quot;actually&quot; was 8min ago. But if it is the Earth orbiting the Sun, the Sun stays in the center and the location in the sky is not old at all (the image is, but not location). That was what I meant that if you shined something at it, some beam of which&#39;s reflection could be detected we could perhaps detect the amount of that reflection and if we figured by taking a appropriate lead when aiming the beam the reflection was stronger then it is the Sun moving, and vice versa.</p>

<p>I need to figure out more about the model to ask about the visibility of galaxies, I really don&#39;t understand it so better not try explain the question better, it is probably just wrong as I don&#39;t get it yet.</p>

<p>The M&amp;M experiment assumes no special relativity. If we do, then it worked just as it should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All theories are created in response to something, or at least most, and I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with that. You make observations and find a solution that satisfies the things seen. Keep doing that and we have a better and better model all the time. Not a correct one, but better than the previous usually.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right we cannot see the Earth move by any optical device, except relative to something else of course, but we could determine if it is the Sun moving around the Earth (or in it I guess), or if the Earth is moving around the Sun, by an optical experiment which I described.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t find it peculiar as that applies to everyday things too, everything is relative and there is no absolute. Even in the inverted model that would apply.</p>

<p>About the star footage, is that not just an out of focus star? Depending on the lens system used in the camera the image will change. Here is an example of focusing / collimating a telescope <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY_fFI0bdOw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY_fFI0bdOw</a></p>

<p>That is what I tried to ask, about how the Milky Way should need to be a thin sphere and after that (inside that) would be the next closest galaxy, as a sphere too, and so on, all the way into the center of the Universe.</p>

<p>That kind of a model where everything is a sphere inside another sphere ... inside the Earth would make it look like like it in reality does. My question was formed poorly, I should have just asked whether galaxies are spheres inside each other or are they separated from each other like how we see them.</p>

<p>I can see how this concave Earth theory can be made to work for the most part, but what still bugs my mind is how it should be measurable whether it is the Earth or the Sun moving, by shining a beam to it and measuring the reflection or the amount of it. I haven&#39;t yet dug if such measurements have been done, for example can the Sun be ranged with a powerful enough laser and has it been done. If so, that in my mind should prove this theory to one side or the other, depending how the laser was aimed at the Sun. Of course it could be that the arcing does affect this in a way that it makes both of the situations look identical, but I have yet to understand if that is so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it is. At the moment i have no ideas for an experiment that would be easy to do with common easy to get items. It&#39;s hard as everything I can think of comes to being identical with or without inversion, or arcing, only the model changes.</p>

<p>I googled about the Sun laser range finding and apparently that has not been done nor is yet even possible, so I can forget about that one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fun thought experiment no doubt, though I don&#39;t find the theory likely, just because I don&#39;t see where it makes things simpler or would explain something unresolved. I have searched for experiments in youtube, but they seem to always fail to take something into account, like arcing, some parameters arc while some don&#39;t, or nothing arcs except the surface of the Earth. Though, it seems the model is by no means simple so I don&#39;t blame people forgetting to apply aspects of it to everything while making experiments. I guess my Sun ranging could be an example of that too =)</p>

<p>Has this model something to do with religions or creation? I think you compared it to a womb and said all things are placed for us with no mistakes made (if I remember right what you said), do you feel this would explain some aspects of some religion or anything related easier?</p>

<p>Also, in this model, has the Universe grown, how did it come to being?</p>

<p>Edit:
I was thinking of what you quoted from Einstein. If no optical experiment can determine the Earth&#39;s movement, it is odd that they, or nobody else, never noticed that light arcs everywhere. Some experiments like M&amp;M and many similar ones would have shown either differences in timing or light end location. Timing because depending on the apparatus&#39; orientation some light paths (arcs) are longer than others, and that either causes a timing mismatch or light travels the faster the more curved it is and then only a location mismatch would be noticed. The arcing suggested by this model is so huge that is should be apparent in small test devices.</p>

<p>An other oddly simple thing came to mind that I didn&#39;t think before, is it explained why the Sun doesn&#39;t seem to look smaller when it&#39;s coming up / going down, or close to the apparent horizon at least, as at that point it should be the furthest from you? Same goes for the Moon and all the planets too, and in a perhaps smaller degree the image of Milky Way. This could perhaps be explained away with the &quot;condensing&quot;, the inversion, but then it should work not based on how close something is to the center of the Universe, but how far away it is from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This I hadn&#39;t thought of because the M&amp;M is famous because it produced a &quot;negative result,&quot; but it was only negative because the hypothesis was that it would demonstrate the spin of the earth.  The results of the experiment are not quite zero however.  They show a very small existence of what they call &quot;ether.&quot;  So the light did not quite stay perfectly in phase which would have produced a true negative result.  </p>

<p>Not sure what I think about that I will have to read more.</p>

<p>I prefer not to cite religion as evidence especially since I myself am not religious, but I do think the model does necessitate a creator.</p>

<p>It also puts some of the bible in better context.  I won&#39;t quote scripture but for instance before the &quot;great flood&quot; the sun stopped in the sky and water poured out of the heavens, which would obviously be impossible in the Copernican hypothesis.  Also the bible does constantly refer to us being &quot;in&quot; the earth rather than &quot;on.&quot;  The firmament in the sky to separate the waters from the waters.   The &quot;heavens above&quot; make more sense.  Nowhere does the bible refer to the earth moving, although it does refer to the stars and the sun moving. </p>

<p>As other concave advocates say it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abdelkader says his main reason for believing in his inverted model is the relief it brings from the anxiety of thinking the universe is so immense that the earth fades into insignificance.  Braun earlier expressed the same emotion by writing that once you accept his model the fearful distances of billions of light years. the infinite emptiness and senselessness&quot; of the Copernican model disappears. A Freudian would say that the inside-out universe expresses an unconscious urge to return to the warmth and security of the womb.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly not evidence.  But if the concave hypothesis is indeed true it makes us intimately related with our creator.  Like instead of having an infinite universe as his creation he has a smaller and limited system that was placed here specifically for our existence.  </p>

<p>It makes the Fermi Paradox make more sense.  There would be nowhere else in the universe that life could evolve.  </p>

<p>I mean you say it doesn&#39;t make anything make more sense, but what about the fact that the earth shows no apparent movement.  I mean just think of the common flat earth arguments that you should weigh more at the north pole than you do at the equator.  If you launch a cannonball straight up it lands perfectly near where it was fired.  </p>

<p>If you apply Occam&#39;s Razor to the M&amp;M experiment which conclusion would you draw honestly?  Special relativity, or the fact that the earth does not move?</p>

<p>One major problem with the concave hypothesis is the fact that NASA and the military industrial complex would have to know.  They would have had to experience the glass in the sky and know how to get a geostationary satellite to work, etc. which would involve a decent amount of people to be in the know.  I don&#39;t think this rules it out, I mean the military did shoot nukes into the sky in an operation called &quot;Operation Fishbowl,&quot; (which actually makes a bit more sense.) but still it would have to be an actively suppressed conspiracy by NASA and most other militaries.</p>

<p>I think you should watch that documentary I linked when you get a chance.  It&#39;s long but it is inspiring and very thorough.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After writing that I started to think about ring laser gyros and why they don&#39;t measure the spin of the Earth, I somehow assumed it after the quote from Einstein, but in fact they do, and googling reveals a precise enough one have been built in the 90&#39;s. It measured both the wobble of the Earth and it&#39;s spin. For the gyros to work they need some aspects of special relativity. Edit: <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-12/tum-fed122211.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-12/tum-fed122211.php</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re right I haven&#39;t watched the documentary yet, but maybe yeah I should. I guess it answers many of my questions.</p>

<p>My feelings at the moment are that the theory would be much more likely if the glass bowl things were forgotten, or half suns and Moons like that youtube guy suggests, as then it would not conflict as much and make these problems like NASA knowing too much. An inverted Universe I guess could work and would pose no problems orbiting the Sun or the planets, or landing on the Moon, but put glass in there and it becomes too weird for me ;) Occam&#39;s Razor at that glass point takes me back to a model where we or the Sun are not in the center of the Universe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty much a mainstream guy in the sense of believing into theories, but just as a curiosity I will point that I at least somewhat believe the Earth is a growing, or at least was, entity. Where this got started was looking at the map, how all the continents fit together and how unlikely it sounds that they were once clumped at one point of the planet and the rest was water.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>about the cannonball, does it really land on the same spot? It should not and because of the same fact (most) space rockets are launched east to conserve energy. On the poles they would land quite close. Is there actually something to show for this argument?</p>

<p>They fail to see that moving &amp; rotating reference frames are two totally different things, the latter is in reference to the former, and does not mean light speed varies when the frame is rotated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, what a documentary. Could have been cut to 30 minutes, the first 2 hours didn&#39;t contain anything, and the later part then the CMB experiments which were new to me in this sense, but wow did they know how to make it long. But that said, the CMB anisotropy is interesting indeed! Have to read more about that.</p>

<p>I though the first 2 hours would have been what the documentary was and the next 2 hours explained their theories how they see the Universe. Do you have another suggestion for a good documentary about the concave Earth where the glass etc are explained?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the CMB experiments are what pushed it over the top for me.  It makes the electromagnetic model that Steven endorses work.  </p>

<p>Did the CMB map of the cosmos resemble a Yin Yang to you?  </p>

<p>I agree the documentary is very long and I wish there was a condensed free version, but nonetheless I think it was well done.  </p>

<p>Most of the evidence presented like the galaxies in concentric spheres and the CMB radiation aligning with the earth strike me as evidence of the concave hypothesis, did you get that impression?</p>

<p>I will see if I can find a good documentary, I know I have seen one.  Steven sort of touches on everything but it is pretty scattered amongst years of videos.  I&#39;ll see what I can find.  Honestly the only person making videos is Steven.  Most of the best evidence I am finding are in books like Teed&#39;s.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I watched a bunch of Steven&#39;s videos but it&#39;s impossible to get a good idea about the theory and answers to the basic questions. With luck I found some, and I&#39;m sure too there are good docs but it&#39;s, especially for me as I don&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;m looking for, hard to find one.</p>

<p>No I did not get that impression, but did get an impression that Earth might be more special than we generally think, or that the errors of the previous theories accumulate to make the finds look like that. I don&#39;t have any knowledge about the specific experiments, but surely there are no devices that can just measure distance to a galaxy (as I found googling about the laser ranging, how it is impossible at the moment at longer scales), so it might just require one assumption to be wrong and the whole picture changes. I&#39;m not ready to accept it as is, from a documentary where they cherry picked information and made sometimes pretty wild conclusions, and at times did not understand the things they were speaking of. That does not in any way make the CMB map any less interesting and possibly ground breaking, but the doc did not give any answers, just jumped to the conclusion that Earth must be in the center of the Universe.</p>

<p>What I have never thought about is the idea that it&#39;s expected the Universe is homogeneous and looks pretty much the same no matter where from you look at it. In a cold deterministic world that might be a good assumption, but as we have free will, I assume so does everything else in a degree, and thus the Universe can do whatever it wants and not be nicely evenly organized, but just the opposite. If there is nothing outside of it, then it has no limits as it created itself. I don&#39;t mean free will would explain the CMB findings or how galaxies were found to be in concentric spheres, but I guess they should not expect to find homogeneous stuff anywhere.</p>

<p>Yin Yang was the first thing that came to mind when they wrapped it to a sphere yeah :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read your reply again and did not notice previously that you said Steven is the only one making videos. Bummer. He should do a comprehensive wrap up of the whole model as he clearly does spend a lot of time already with it.</p>

<p>Also what I left out from my reply to your question did I get the impression those things were pointing at a concave Earth model - I don&#39;t see why it needs to be concave. Just as well it could be that the Earth is convex and in the center of the Universe, and why not even throw a glass bowl surrounding us ;) I don&#39;t think either model is likely, but I have a lot to read &amp; think about the CMB findings.</p>

<p>By the way, the ring laser gyros, if they really can measure the Earth spin (and wobble perhaps), would that wreck the concave Earth model? My guess is partly yes partly no, as the spinning Universe in the center of the Earth might somehow be said to effect the speed of light in the gyro. How they are normally understood is the two paths become different length when the gyro is spun and thus it causes a interference pattern, not that the speed of light would change because of ether or some other reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would also like to add that it does make our equations for relativity and distant galaxies make more sense.</p>

<p>The galaxies are considered to be vast and distant, so the calculation for their mass doesn&#39;t match with the speed that they rotate.  They require much more mass to allow for enough gravity to keep the systems in the galaxy from being propelled out into space.  </p>

<p>So in order to fix this, we assume the existence of dark matter and black holes that have to make up over 90% of the matter in order to make Newtonian equations balance.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it more intuitive to assume that these galaxies are actually smaller, which allows for them to spin faster without propelling their star systems out of orbit while still allowing for Newton&#39;s gravity equation to balance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But isn&#39;t that what the inversion takes care of? The smaller something is due to being closer to the center, the more &quot;condensed&quot; it is, thus actually being the same in mass if you invert it back.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right here.  The mass would be smaller due to inversion but so would the distance so the equation should still be the same.  </p>

<p>This goes back to my earlier claim that these galaxies are not made up of suns and planets.  I believe that they are something else and therefore do not need to adhere to Newtonian physics.</p>

<p>The amatuer footage of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5xFd1gvkdk">stars while zoomed in</a> does produce a perplexing result, which further suggests to me that stars are not suns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a very different perspective to what I would of originally thought and never considered it as a response to such subject as ET&#39;s but it is definitely an eye opener. Very informative and a lot of points that are extremely hard to deny. </p>

<p>To be honest, I was a little put off at the start with it basing it off religion but in terms of NWO, I found it very interesting in parts discussing secrets within Luciferian societies and religions. </p>

<p>A very good view and summary of our age</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I joined reddit to join the search for ET&#39;s.  I was certain they exist and I was sure that I could find what I was looking for by collaborating here.  At the time there was a user named u/theearthisnotmyhome and his content was fascinating.  (I often wonder what happened to that guy.)</p>

<p>Since then though my views have changed.  I no longer believe that organic species that travel in physical crafts can navigate through space and reach us.  That being said, I do still entertain the notion that extra dimensional entities do exist, and they can often be interpreted as ET&#39;s.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your sentence in the broader context of the universe is likely true (i believe this to a 99.99<sup>n</sup> chance).</p>

<p>The real question is wether or not you ponder their existence on this planet.</p>

<p>I find that&#39;s more likely than history going the way we are told. But in between are many layers of chance and mistery that we may not cut through without direct, undeniable evidence.</p>

<p>However if you want strong indication that such beings likely walked this earth (and maybe still do if that was the case), you may want to read the ancient sumerian tales and epics. They contain a lot of datas about so called angels and celestial beings.</p>

<p>Not to dismiss all gnostic literature about the serpent and the archons, which by a later account probably talk about the same.
In between these are also a handful of cultures (mesopotamic, babylonian, akkadian, the ones of the nag hammadi, i don&#39;t remember more at the moment).</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only truly unbiased sort of indication although you will have to pierce through the propaganda (myths) of the time.</p>

<p>Oh yes i forgot the Torah since i take that&#39;s the source of most ancient astronauts theories you may already have heard of (likely yet another account of the same stories from different pov - or a different recollection)</p>

<p>The cool thing about those characters are that they are protagonists of a lot of preserved documents free online so it&#39;s quite an easy search if you want to.</p>

<p>I personally prefer clay tablets and ancient scrolls to modern propaganda about this field, but can&#39;t recommend any author in particular.
The best things i have read as interpretations came from people that commented and compared numerous sources.
That said it&#39;s silly to not be able to read the proper language as there is no guarantee on the accuracy of translations (by ignorance or malice).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The relative motion would be the same between the Sun and the Earth no matter the model, but the effects of shining a say a laser to the Sun behaves different depending on which is orbiting which, which one is the one moving. As light has a delay of 8min from Sun to Earth, if it was the Sun moving, we would see in the sky the Sun at a position that is where it &quot;actually&quot; was 8min ago. But if it is the Earth orbiting the Sun, the Sun stays in the center and the location in the sky is not old at all (the image is, but not location). That was what I meant that if you shined something at it, some beam of which&#39;s reflection could be detected we could perhaps detect the amount of that reflection and if we figured by taking a appropriate lead when aiming the beam the reflection was stronger then it is the Sun moving, and vice versa.</p>

<p>I need to figure out more about the model to ask about the visibility of galaxies, I really don&#39;t understand it so better not try explain the question better, it is probably just wrong as I don&#39;t get it yet.</p>

<p>The M&amp;M experiment assumes no special relativity. If we do, then it worked just as it should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I watched a bunch of Steven&#39;s videos but it&#39;s impossible to get a good idea about the theory and answers to the basic questions. With luck I found some, and I&#39;m sure too there are good docs but it&#39;s, especially for me as I don&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;m looking for, hard to find one.</p>

<p>No I did not get that impression, but did get an impression that Earth might be more special than we generally think, or that the errors of the previous theories accumulate to make the finds look like that. I don&#39;t have any knowledge about the specific experiments, but surely there are no devices that can just measure distance to a galaxy (as I found googling about the laser ranging, how it is impossible at the moment at longer scales), so it might just require one assumption to be wrong and the whole picture changes. I&#39;m not ready to accept it as is, from a documentary where they cherry picked information and made sometimes pretty wild conclusions, and at times did not understand the things they were speaking of. That does not in any way make the CMB map any less interesting and possibly ground breaking, but the doc did not give any answers, just jumped to the conclusion that Earth must be in the center of the Universe.</p>

<p>What I have never thought about is the idea that it&#39;s expected the Universe is homogeneous and looks pretty much the same no matter where from you look at it. In a cold deterministic world that might be a good assumption, but as we have free will, I assume so does everything else in a degree, and thus the Universe can do whatever it wants and not be nicely evenly organized, but just the opposite. If there is nothing outside of it, then it has no limits as it created itself. I don&#39;t mean free will would explain the CMB findings or how galaxies were found to be in concentric spheres, but I guess they should not expect to find homogeneous stuff anywhere.</p>

<p>Yin Yang was the first thing that came to mind when they wrapped it to a sphere yeah :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read your reply again and did not notice previously that you said Steven is the only one making videos. Bummer. He should do a comprehensive wrap up of the whole model as he clearly does spend a lot of time already with it.</p>

<p>Also what I left out from my reply to your question did I get the impression those things were pointing at a concave Earth model - I don&#39;t see why it needs to be concave. Just as well it could be that the Earth is convex and in the center of the Universe, and why not even throw a glass bowl surrounding us ;) I don&#39;t think either model is likely, but I have a lot to read &amp; think about the CMB findings.</p>

<p>By the way, the ring laser gyros, if they really can measure the Earth spin (and wobble perhaps), would that wreck the concave Earth model? My guess is partly yes partly no, as the spinning Universe in the center of the Earth might somehow be said to effect the speed of light in the gyro. How they are normally understood is the two paths become different length when the gyro is spun and thus it causes a interference pattern, not that the speed of light would change because of ether or some other reason.</p>
