        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello to all :) I was thinking of UN-NATURAL food (and we call it in our country GMO lol :D) why we (all around the world, the most in western countries) have that much of them? We all know these arent good for our health (i can only hope that everyone knows) but whats the essence of their point/plan - by &#39;people from the top&#39;?
Yeah, also we know their plan is to make &#39;us&#39; more stupid and make &#39;us&#39; easier to manipate, control...but...they also want a LESS people on the Earth...== smaller number of people =&gt; easier to &#39;do what they want to do&#39;...but isnt this also their plan..maybe? (i was thinking about it ~2 weeks ago):</p>

<p>To change our &#39;hetero hormones&#39; to &#39;homo hormones&#39; (because difference between gays and &#39;normal&#39; are harmones) so by changing it - World will have more gay, so it means less preductivity of new lifes/new children...so like i said (we all know) reduce the number of people = easier for controlling</p>

<p>*Maybe GMO isnt changing our hormones, but Yep, food is totally unnatural now and it does something with hormones, have too much additives and ect...to be honest, dont know much about that &#39;wrong&#39; food (cuz im trying to avoid it) but its easy to figure out that these food dont contain anything logic to eat...:D i hope you understood what i wanted to say, so im hoping for some rational replies, thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>Everything causes cancer. The sun causes cancer. Well toasted bread causes cancer. What you&#39;re referring to is a study in which they fed and injected rats with toxic doses of the active chemical every day until they got cancer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is just one of those things that just &quot;sounds scary&quot;, sort of like &quot;reclaimed water&quot;. The truth is that it&#39;s harmless to humans. I&#39;m sure if you drank a jar of roundup you&#39;d feel nauseous but the fact of the matter is that our bodies are of a different size and chemical makeup than the insects targeted by roundup, and it&#39;s not harmful to us. There are infinite things that are harmful to one species and not another, and everything is toxic in a large enough dose. </p>

<p>Also there have been extensive studies conducted on the safety of this stuff, well outside of the corrupt FDA. In regards to Roundup and GMO&#39;s in general the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it&#39;s safe, so you&#39;d have to double down and say the scientific community is in on the grand conspiracy, in which case most of what we &quot;know&quot; about anything goes out the window. GUESS IT&#39;S A FLAT EARTH AFTER ALL GUYS!</p>

<p>Yes, but Nestle has been considerably worse and you guys aren&#39;t flipping your lids over their products.</p>

<p>Genetic Modification does not belong to Monsanto. Monsanto is just another corrupt, soulless business and it&#39;s silly to use it as an argument against genetic modification.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting a conspiracy to feed people genetically modified food which somehow made them sterile then I can tell you right now that there are FAR more cost effective ways of accomplishing that and it&#39;s an absurd to use that as an argument against GMO&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this:
Look at the environmental effects of pesticides used, not just the use on the actual plants but also the production of these chemicals produces runoff.  Also many pesticides lead to soil degradation. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that pesticides and GMOs can be replaced.</p>

<p>They increase yields, in a system that <a href="http://harvestpublicmedia.org/content/tossed-out">has a huge problem with waste</a>.</p>

<p>So maybe we should focus on fixing food waste issues?</p>

<p>Small, local, poly-culture farms would be the ideal fix. Reduction of shipping, reduction of food waste, increased job opportunities. </p>

<p><a href="http://scitech.au.dk/en/roemer/5-2015/ants-are-as-effective-as-pesticides/">Use nature</a> to deal with pests/disease.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier/faster/more productive to spray weeds with pesticides, or you could just pull them out of the ground with a shovel, or get a couple of goats which will graze on weeds. But that&#39;s not quick enough for today&#39;s fast paced world, so continue to put on a hazmat suit and spray toxins?</p>

<p><a href="https://ucanr.edu/repositoryfiles/ca3607p14-61827.pdf">here&#39;s a study showing the benefits of poly-culture and how leaving some weeds help keep away pests/disease</a></p>

<p>Eliminating one part of the natural cycle of things has never worked out well. Nature is a self regulating system.  We find something that destroys one (or more) pest/weed, and some system is disrupted, or it becomes resistant and even stronger than before.</p>

<p>Yes, we are a long ways from mapping a whole genome. But each gene has a specific purpose, like a piece of furniture in a house. There&#39;s a gene for eye color. We know that&#39;s what it does, and that&#39;s all it does.</p>

<p>Imagine you&#39;re walking through a mansion. You don&#39;t know what lies on the other end of the mansion, but you can recognize a chair or a painting as you walk by it. And if you move the chair or change the upholstery you know it won&#39;t affect the fixtures in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that&#39;s the way of the world and it&#39;s hard to do it any differently, especially in regards to matters as expensive as this. I can&#39;t imagine a nonprofit GM institution faring very well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. The reason genetic code is so extensive is because of how specific each gene is in purpose. The gene for eye color truly is just a gene for eye color and I&#39;m fairly certain we know that just as well as we can know anything in science.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, yes. But few people get to enjoy the privilege of being able to not pursue profit. Sadly, the most progress in science occurs when there&#39;s potential profit involved and I suspect that&#39;s what it will take with genetics. Especially with the paranoia surrounding it... The general people don&#39;t support GMO&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genes don&#39;t do just one thing. Exon splicing, epigenetics, for example, can cause one dna sequence to have different effects.</p>

<p>Separately, perhaps a gene normally produces small amounts of a protein. The protein is fine in small amounts, but poison at higher dose. If that gene is genetically transferred, or a promoter gene for it is genetically transferred, that protein could be produced in large amounts, which could make eating the genetically engineered food poisonous. </p>

<p>Our bodies are run the best off fasting and alkaline foods that are filled with electricity. Our bodies are not only physical but also electric.</p>

<p>Plants and nuts are the only ways to get alkaline food today. All GMO foods have had their acidity cranked up so that eating an alkaline diet is nearly impossible. Even people who think they are eating an alkaline diet normally aren&#39;t. They do not expect the tomatoes, apples, bananas, and the majority of other foods they eat to actually be acidic. In reality they are, they take out electricity from the foods and make it almost impossible to reach an alkaline state.</p>

<p>In an alkaline state our bodies are filled with more energy, the Chinese call it Chi energy. Humans are actually magical believe it or not and they have worked in conspiracy to make us lose our abilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know how nerves work on a very basic level?</p>

<p>An electrical impulse</p>

<p>Edit:
To take this further:</p>

<p>Every action that happens in the body, whether it be a muscle movement or something you don&#39;t consciously do like make a blood cell, it takes energy derived from food.</p>

<p>Also, what atoms are made up of?</p>

<p>protons, neutrons, and electrons</p>

<p>We are made entirely of atoms, each atom is stored energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you are being a stickler for syntax.  Sounds like you might be the type of person who thinks in only black and white, no gray area.</p>

<p>So are you saying because the exchange is through much larger ions it is not an electric process? Is there no energy being used?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are nerve impulses?
A nerve impulse is an electrical signal that travels along an axon. There is an electrical difference between the inside of the axon and its surroundings, like a tiny battery. When the nerve is activated, there is a sudden change in the voltage across the wall of the axon, caused by the movement of ions in and out of the neuron. This triggers a wave of electrical activity that passes from the cell body along the length of the axon to the synapse. A nerve impulse is a wave of electrical activity that passes from one end of a neuron to the other.</p>

<p>Or you can just search google &quot;Nerve Impulse&quot;</p>

<p>There will be pages of articles, videos, and explanations about how nerve impulses are electrical signals. </p>

<p>You need to stop thinking inside a small box.</p>

<p>Edit: I just noticed that your comment said:</p>

<p>Nerves do not conduct electrons.</p>

<p>Did my original comment insinuate that?  All I stated was that nerves use electric impulses.</p>

<p>Maybe a definition of energy would help you buddy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In physics, energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms. The &quot;ability of a system to perform work&quot; is a common description, but it is misleading because energy is not necessarily available to do work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, I&#39;m a real scientist getting a real PhD at a real university in the exact area you&#39;re talking about. You&#39;re not thinking outside the box, you&#39;re just making shit up. What you&#39;re saying is so demonstrably wrong and your understanding of &quot;science&quot; is so backwards that I&#39;m not sure where to start. I&#39;ll go through your &quot;response.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All these things you&#39;re asking are not electricity in the form most people think of like turning a light on. None of my comments said that the body is taking nutrients from electricity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. So, I&#39;m an engineer. Electricity is not energy. Please stop equating them. Energy is Voltage x Current x Time. Your inability to even articulate that shows you have a tenuous grasp on what electricity even is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any activity that the body does requires requires energy. You can talk about the body in the most complex way you would like, but you cannot deny: energy in=energy out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, no one questions that buddy. Basic 1st law of thermodynamics, which you could have quoted but you clearly haven&#39;t studied any of this so what&#39;s the point. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The word energy freaks people out when used out of any other context then a light bulb... Immediately being regarded as &quot;woowoo magicks&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, no? I did my undergrad research on bioelectricity and biological circuits. Electrical energy isn&#39;t just a &quot;lightbulb&quot; (which is thermal energy anyway, but I&#39;m sure you knew that), but there&#39;s also inductors, memsistors, capacitors, batteries, the list goes on of different ways to store electrical energy. You aren&#39;t some special snowflake. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally, calories are energy, atoms are stored energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, where do I even start. Yes, by definition a calorie is a unit of energy but <em>generally</em> scientists use the term Joule. You, of course, knew that. 
Your lack of ability to articulate the difference between atoms and molecules when describing this also says a lot. While it is true atoms have a lot of energy in the form of weak force interactions (NOT ELECTROMAGNETIC), most biological energy results from the formation of entropy-driven molecular bond forming as a results of respiration. You, of course, knew this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Particles can be seen as both a particle and a wave. Everything can be viewed as waves. A wave is a form of energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the classic example every pseudoscientist quotes when they want to sound much more informed than what they actually are. Everything can be viewed as having an associated wave function, however electrons are the only particles that have wave functions that are practically useful. Anything bigger and you get wavelengths smaller than the size of a hydrogen atom (i.e. their wave function collapses under all observations). This right here is the biggest load of bullshit you&#39;re peddling. Waves and frequencies are not forms of energy, that is false. By definition they are not energy. Frequency scales with energy, sure, but it is not the equivalent of energy. Saying waves are energy is semantic word salad- you have no idea what you&#39;re saying, you&#39;re just throwing out words. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re stuck on the idea that energy is electricity running through a wire and turning it into light. Energy is much more than that my friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol. Okay. Get back to me on all of my points and we can come back to this. The world isn&#39;t some pandora&#39;s box of mysticism. Electromagnetism (lol, you keep saying electricity and totally ignoring the magnetic aspect) is actually one of the most well-defined forces in our universe. It is incredibly detailed and studied, just because you don&#39;t know it doesn&#39;t make it so. As an engineer, reading your statements about electricity makes me cringe so badly because you clearly DO NOT understand what you&#39;re saying. It&#39;s all word salad. </p>

<p>Pepperoni pizzas make good breathing apparatuses for fish. That&#39;s logically equivalent to what you&#39;ve been peddling. </p>

<p>Real scientists think outside the box, we design our own experiments and we push the boundaries of knowledge and try to get a better understanding of the world. Sure, &quot;there&#39;s plenty more to learn,&quot; but you&#39;re not impressing anyone with 8-11 letter words that are basically mumbo jumbo. </p>

<p>Get back to me though, I&#39;d love to hear you prove me wrong in detail. ALSO, you still never responded to me about how biomass transport and ATP were going to be created in your system. As far as is understood, you require ATP for virtually all cell transactions. You cannot make ATP from electricity. That&#39;s not how it works. If you want to propose a non-canonical pathway for this, by all means do so. Otherwise, you&#39;re not impressing anyone and at worst you&#39;re hurting society by spreading lies and bad science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you on getting a real PhD!</p>

<p>Took you long enough to give actual explanations. You say that people do a disservice to science by bringing up the points I made, though the way in which you argue is not helping science.  </p>

<p>First, you didn&#39;t have any explanations in your initial handful of comments, just vague scientific terms (with no explanation) and ad hominems.  </p>

<p>Second, the tone of your writing is demeaning and outright indignant (don&#39;t worry my feelings aren&#39;t hurt, but if your trying to convince people of anything, it doesn&#39;t help your argument to come off as a pretentious know-it-all douche).  </p>

<p>In all your comments you make it sound as if I think I know everything and that I am a genius.  At what point did I say this?  We&#39;re having an argument in a conspiracy forum and I&#39;m pointing out ideas that are not normally accepted, big surprise!</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s different types of energy and electromagnetic forces play a role.  Did you save that for this comment to make me look dumb?  Your first comments are vague and insulting and now you bring all these other factors into play to downplay me?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your lack of ability to articulate the difference between atoms and molecules when describing this also says a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When did I say anything about molecules?  When I compare calories to atoms I know that food and calories are complex molecules, my point is that the building blocks are atoms (my point being that its all made of atoms).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the classic example every pseudoscientist quotes when they want to sound much more informed than what they actually are.

Frequency scales with energy, sure, but it is not the equivalent of energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So everything does have a wave function/signature. Wave functions collapse so they are disregarded? Yeah because we have it all figured out right? We know what dark matter is and exactly what goes on inside a black hole?  Just because we are unable to observe something does not mean it ceases to exist, if you&#39;re studying science I hope you know this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as is understood, you require ATP for virtually all cell transactions. You cannot make ATP from electricity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When ATP is used for cell transactions is that not a form of energy?
Again, I never once stated that you can make ATP from electricity.</p>

<p>You continue to try to make this argument more and more complex and convoluted.</p>

<p>But the ATP question brings me back to my original answer:</p>

<p>Energy is the &quot;ability of a system to perform work&quot;</p>

<p>So, yeah a nerve impulse is energy by the above idea.</p>

<p>You need to take a deep breath before you have an brain aneurysm pal.</p>

<p>You&#39;re hurting science by thinking everything is either black or white, by thinking that science has it all figured out, by not being able to accept anything other than what is taught to you.</p>

<p>How much more orthogonal and precise do you want than:</p>

<p>Energy is the &quot;ability of a system to perform work&quot;
A nerve impulse (or ATP action) is a system that performs work.
Therefore...
A nerve impulse (or ATP action) is energy!</p>

<p>I am well aware of what the definition of energy is, I have an actual accredited degree with scholastic backing to demonstrate it. You just keep saying the Wikipedia definition over and over again, I&#39;m not even sure you can define what <em>Work</em> is. You have literally said nothing that makes sense or is of importance aside from what you&#39;ve googled.</p>

I want concise details, not your hand waiving magic where you propose some absurd mechanism and then quote the definition of energy. </p>

<p>A GMO is an organism that&#39;s been genetically modified. As in, it&#39;s DNA got changed. In no way does this change the acidity of an organism unless that&#39;s what you specifically decided to do. You can GM a lemon to make it <em>less</em> acidic. Similarly, you can GM a lemon to make it more packed with nutrients. Genetic modification just makes an organism into whatever you want it to be.</p>

All fruits or vegetables whether they are sweet or sour actually turns alkaline in your body. Your logic is like saying just eat a bunch of bland foods and your body turns alkaline. No. GMO foods are less nutrient dense and do not alkalize in your body like Non-GMO foods. On top of that you are sitting here defending the system. The system deserves to go down in every aspect.

<p>Scientifically speaking, an increase in alkalinity would LITERALLY MAKE IT TASTE MORE ACIDIC. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Things don&#39;t magically become healthier when you&#39;ve deemed it natural. The instant you so much as cook a food it&#39;s become unnatural.</p>

<p>The only difference between a GMO lemon and another lemon is the altered gene.</p>

<p>Think of it this way:</p>

<p>Imagine a person got genetically modified to have blue eyes when they normally would have had brown eyes.</p>

<p>They are not more acidic, they are not less energetic, there is literally nothing different except the color of their eyes, because that was the only gene that was altered. It was as if they had inherited the gene, but they didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GMO foods are less nutrient dense</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t based in any sort of fact. Whether a GMO food is more or less nutrient dense depends solely on how they decided to design it. If all they&#39;re altering is the color of a peach then the density of nutrients will be exactly the same. Genetics is simpler than you think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of that you are sitting here defending the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m defending science and scientific fact. Science doesn&#39;t care about what the establishment is doing or how people feel, it&#39;s about the logical study of all that which is observable. If a fact is inconvenient or unsettling then so be it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire system has Satan written on it if you do your research.</p>

<p>I think Satan is a laughably absurd concept and Christians can&#39;t even agree on what he&#39;s supposed to be. Is he just some fallen angel who does as much as the Bible says he does, or is he actually author of a bunch of grand pranks on humanity? I say neither because it&#39;s silly. The concept of Satan only exists to enforce fear among the irrational, and fear is a detriment to reason.</p>

<p>This is about food in general, not GMO foods, and it doesn&#39;t say that the food actually alters our genetic makeup. DNA is an actual physical substance and the study talks about how it can make it to our bloodstream. That doesn&#39;t mean it influences OUR genetic makeup anymore than it would to stick your finger in a cup of DNA. It doesn&#39;t do anything on contact.</p>

<p>Again, GMO foods don&#39;t have some magical new effect on your body as opposed to a regular food. It&#39;s just a food with different DNA. That&#39;s IT. Whether it&#39;s a selectively bred apple or a genetically modified apple has no difference of consequence on your health and this would be an obvious fact if you bothered to learn more about genetics. Please, look into the subject, if not to learn more about GMO&#39;s than just because it&#39;s an incredibly interesting and important field in general.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what cognitive dissonance is.</p>

<p>Look, man. I&#39;m sorry for being rude. Just understand that this is one of the only matters I get offended over... When I feel that science is being misinterpreted or misrepresented in a way that could impede progress. If there&#39;s anything I fear it&#39;s the phenomenon of misinformation. Surely we can both agree that that&#39;s a terrifying thing.</p>

<p>It causes tumors, probably causes cancer. Every food causes something different because it is not what we are supposed to eat.</p>

<p>Our unhealthy lifestyles make our bodies very stiff which in turn means our muscles are constantly activated. We also live a stressful life, stress gets stuck in our bodies and causes illness. We sit all day and they have somehow tricked us into thinking that fasting is bad. They also tell us fat is not good for us and carbs are. Sugar is carbs. Sugar is the worst. They have basically funneled all fat people into ignoring fat and consuming more carbs, which in turn makes them eat more sugar.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a rubiks cube figuring it out but the truth is still out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think GMO&#39;s are making people as sick as you believe. There are a ton of different factors at play to our daily lives. For starters, it might be because how fucking clean the 1st world is today. Parents today make their kids too clean. This one kid in my class a while ago had parents who were obsessed with being clean and controlled his food and what he ate. Needless to say that we was always sick with somthing and he had a bunch of food allergies. That might be an extreme case but it shows that being too clean is bad but that doesn&#39;t mean we should be dirty because that could also have negative effects. As far as obesity in the world, I blame that all on the sugar industry with all shit they put in the food. Natural sugars are good but obviously you shouldn&#39;t eat it all day, every day. So while people may think that playing god with food may sound scary, it&#39;s not as bad as people make it out to be. If it makes the food bigger, last longer, and fights off nasty bugs that will get you sick, why wouldn&#39;t we do it? Is it because it&#39;s unethical to play god? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s because the same people who have modified those foods are the same people who have tricked everyone into thinking fats are bad for you. The same people who feed us sugar on a grand scale. Are the same people who sell heroin to everyone for dirt cheap prices. Are the same people who stress everyone out. Are the same people who spray terrible pesticides all over fruits and veggies that we after eat. It&#39;s a chain event. Evil is written all over them. There are tons of sources of what GMO foods do to animals. Tumors mainly but you either stay in ignorance or really look at this world for what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again I think this Comes back to education and being concerned for what we cannot really understand. GMO&#39;s are done behind closed doors so natrually there is rise for theories. Most modern pesticides are harmful to animals who consume it on a large scale. By the time we consume those Foods there is only traces amounts of pesticide which our Body can handle and flush out of our System. Now, is there concern with all of this? Of course. Should we Panic? No but simply Keep a Close eye</p>

<p>There actually aren&#39;t any definitive studies either way, assuming we discount the industry-funded ones as bullshit just like the old industry-funded tobacco studies that showed it was just fine and the industry-funded leaded fuel additive studies that showed it was just fine.</p>

<p>whats the essence of their point/plan - by &#39;people from the top&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perpetual profit.</p>

<p>Create a seed that is pest and drought resistant but that doesn&#39;t produce any seeds. Sell that seed to farmers. They theoretically produce more crops and earn more money. But because the crops don&#39;t seed with anything that will actually grow, they need to buy seed from you next year, and the next year, and so on...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they also want a LESS people on the Earth</p>

<p>Fewer people = fewer people to sell to = fewer $.</p>

<p>To change our &#39;hetero hormones&#39; to &#39;homo hormones&#39; (because difference between gays and &#39;normal&#39; are harmones)</p>

<p>Back to school with you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>World will have more gay, so it means less preductivity of new lifes/new children</p>

<p>Education + birth control. Both are a hell of a lot cheaper than some inane conspiracy to turn people gay, if that were even possible.</p>

<p>They do produce seeds. Legally not allowed to use. Farmers dont tend to save seed anyway as its not economic. The repurchasing of seeds is seen throughout organic farming.</p>
