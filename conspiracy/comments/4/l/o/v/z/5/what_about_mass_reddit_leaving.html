    <div class="md"><p>Sure Reddit is turning into a cancer, but we are the Chemo attacking the Cancer cells, waking people up, proving to the sleep walkers that we were right about shit decades ago just now coming to the surface. The top 30-50 replies in a lot of new posts in various subs are starting to sound like us, people questioning corporate 1% motives and no longer trust gov, media, fb, the system in general.</p>

<p>I got my nephew into all of this critical thinking stuff and he regularly visits media news (sellout site) and posts replies in the comment section to make readers rethink everything.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t think there will be a massive exodus just yet.....any alternatives are still in infancy mode....but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll happen next few years when the ads become crazy blatant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also got on liberals for being faggy.  He spent about 1 page giving a fair warning of technology, then spent the next 20 pages talking about how faggy liberals were and how much he hated them and how they were all closet faggy socialists who &#39;couldn&#39;t compete&#39; because of their faginess.  Its kind of insulting actually--because people like unabomb and other right wing authoritarians don&#39;t understand sharing or the fact that some of us are motivated by something other than greed.  He really was a gaddamned lunatic and I can&#39;t consider any of his work really intelligent or praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Did you read his manifesto?  I did.  That&#39;s where I&#39;m getting this from.  I was pissed by the end of it because I&#39;m a faggy liberal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conscious of the ruling class is, at least IMO, superior to that of the masses. What I mean is that, for hundreds of years the elite have been essentially running the same scams on the masses.</p>

<p>They probably have the best education, occult books, the whole 9 yards. Though they still die and the next generation will have to learn all over again, and only then advance the elites&#39; agenda. If they could transfer a consiousness to eliminate the need for every generation to relearn the basics, that would probably give them an even larger advantage.</p>

<p>How does it affect your daily life? None at all I&#39;d say. But then again, most of us our concerned with &#39;our lives&#39; and the elites&#39; are concerned with golbal domination. The whole &#39;it doesn&#39;t affect me so I don&#39;t care&#39; is probably what go us into this shit show in the first place. &quot;I don&#39;t care that those priests are sacrificing Tom, as long as it isn&#39;t me...&quot;</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I don&#39;t give a shit about any of it except the monetary system that supports all of it (good and bad). A General Boycott that attacks all elites&#39; bottom lines is IMHO the only battle one need engage in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult to get these things going.  I2p and freenet.  When you finally do, you realize there&#39;s nothing there that&#39;s worth it, and it took FOREVER to get it, and when you did it&#39;s like some teen girls fanfic video of something you don&#39;t understand or want to understand and the whole thing is just so dumb that it&#39;s surreal.  Also its true there&#39;s kid porn there.  And there&#39;s snuff films on darknet sites.  It&#39;s stuff you can&#39;t unsee. I&#39;ve chosen not to use these things because I just don&#39; twant to see that shit. </p>

<p>tor is pretty easy, but it&#39;s also slow, but it also works...but it&#39;s also a target..and it&#39;s also been compromised in a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er, you think TPTB give a fuck?</p>

<p>Reddit, Facebook and the like serve several purposes. One of the most under estimated is the mitigation of decisive action and inertia.</p>

<p>Getting on reddit and hitting a few up arrows, posting a few well crafted comments. Well it&#39;s a bit like fapping at 7pm on a Friday night before going out to socialise with the opposite sex. Once you&#39;ve got the energy out of your system a TV dinner and a good DVD is a much more appealing option.</p>

<p>So a mass exodus (not that it would happen) to another newer social media site would change nothing.
It would be like bees moving bee hive. Once the move is done then the bee keepers move nearby and do their smoke for honey thing.
And we all know the army of beekeepers is always ready to roll. Give it a few months and things would be back to where we are now. Everybody fapping to prescribed doom porn with no appropriate action ever taken.</p>

<p>What we need is not more social media but pitchforks and torches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are a pack animal. So once our technology gets advanced enough; then the only logical conclusion is to have some form of social interaction through that new technology. Think about those trucker radios people could buy at home and talk to each other, or truckers passing through their town in the 70s. Taking the ads out of free products is hard.</p>

<p>I think a hard question to answer is; how do you offer people a free product without bombarding them with advertisments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what? Facebook and Reddit aren&#39;t exclusive, as soon as you open your browser, whatever page your on, there&#39;s hundreds of company&#39;s sucking as much information as they can from you so if you&#39;re leaving for those reasons you might as well just unplug from the net, because if you want true privacy, that&#39;s the only way I can see atm that you&#39;re going to get it</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with all this btw, but if I use the net I&#39;m going to be tracked. 
Reddit knows that I like records, ufo&#39;s, conspiracy theories, milfs etc but if you were my friend you&#39;d know that anyway. </p>

<p>I think people should stay put, out the shills, try and filter the shit, post your own stuff and don&#39;t just rely on everyone else (talking to myself here too). </p>

Those with the power to see through the lies are not in danger but thos unplugging from the system will have a harder and harder time of it because of dilution of the message, controlled counter intelligence and cultural marxist compromise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always people like you who will criticise reddit, suggest everyone should leave. But continue to use the site indefinitely, with no intentions of ever going.</p>

<p>Is participation increasing or deceasing?</p>

<p>Anecdotally it <em>feels</em> like there&#39;s less participation in certain default forums, for example <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> <em>feels</em> like i use to generally have more comments than it does these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to let you in on a secret:  Reddit is awesome because it&#39;s a site that curates the whole internet without you having to pay a dime.  If you leave this website, you&#39;re surely a fool.  Because it&#39;s like getting the newspaper with stories from everywhere else, but only the best stuff.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the secret.  That Reddit is awesome.  Even with the forum spies that try to tell you that it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Or that follow you around and try to insult you or discredit you with stuff you know they had to dig through 20 paginations to find where you contradicted yourself in some minor out-of-context way.</p>
