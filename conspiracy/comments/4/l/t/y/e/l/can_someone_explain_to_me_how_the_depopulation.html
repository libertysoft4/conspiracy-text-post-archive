    <div class="md"><p>actually no, the catholic church was weakened. People in europe felt they had been good catholics, and that they were either being unjustly punished by god, or that the jews made the disease (jews overall had more cleanly habits then the average european, so they were less effected by the disease, which caused suspicion) Also after the plague, serfdom was practically abolished in western europe (though it did rise in place such as austria and eastern europe)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants&#39; already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. Feudalism never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.[24] As population growth resumed however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine</p>

<p>There was a significant impact on religion, as many believed the plague was God&#39;s punishment for sinful ways.[40] The Church lands and buildings were unaffected, but there were too few priests left to maintain the old schedule of services. Over half the parish priests, who gave the final sacraments to the dying, themselves died. The Church moved to recruit replacements, but the process took time. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.[41] The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for lay women to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.[42]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a culling, not denying that. But the Catholic church benefited. The Medici&#39;s would like a word with you. This is where the Black Nobility comes from. People think it ends with Rockefellers or Rothschilds. lol........ That is my point. The Holy Roman Empire prospered during this time, it&#39;s not hidden, but you need to research history to find it....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We arent delving into science fiction. Transhumanism is the future even according to official US intellligence reports. Truth is stranger than fiction my freind.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter what you bite or you dont. Brain chips were used by Delgado to stop a charging bull back in the 1970s. You cant eve nimagine what they have now at this age. - Delgado Bull <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23pXqY3X6c8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23pXqY3X6c8</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Advanced brainwashing will be used on them. People demand so much even now but what happens ? Absolutely nothing because most guys are kept in a brainwashed state.</p>

<p>what do you think will be the state of mind of these 500 million people. They will themselves be altered and merged with robots thats what transhumanism is all about. They wont have independent thought. </p>

<p>Also brainchips and other techniques will make them total robotic slaves. </p>

<p>So what you are seeing here is the end of humanity as we no it. It cant be compared to our present in anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as i said, human input will be necessary for something, and these humans will be so irreplacable, that they could demand anything, because no one can replace them, and if the government kills the last of the populace, they have basically killed themselves</p>
