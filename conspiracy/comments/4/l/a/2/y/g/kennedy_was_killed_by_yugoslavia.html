But consider what you know about the shooting and the new evidence braught forth by the film Huston we have a proble. The authors of the fil showed how Yugoslavia sold mostly made up stats about its space program to the USA, the makes of the film had unprrssidented acess to Yugoslav armies files. </p>

<p>Now consider the &quot;bqbushka&quot; the russian looking lady on all the pictures. Has anyone ever thaught she might not be Russian but actualy Yuugoslavian? </p>

<p>We know now the fersly anti communist Kennedy was furious at Yugoslavia, it is my presumption he wanted to atack. We also know that the Yugoslav secret service, known as UDBA was one of the worlds top at the time, right after Mosad, KGB, CIA and Stazi. </p>

<p>Therforth i put out the possibility that it was Yugoslavia who forged a plot to kill Kenedy and that the babuška lady was a Yugoslav observer filming the event as it went down. </p>

The Zapruder film is definitely spliced together,which shows editing, like the crowd doesn&#39;t seem to match the car passing by scene.</p>

I think it&#39;s plausible but unlikely unless you can somehow link people like Oswald, Ruby or any of the &#39;usual suspects&#39;.

<p>It is interesting and plausable. I did only put it out there as food for thaught. But it might be possible to track down the babishka lady if one would search for people travelig from YU at the time. And the records of the former republocs are opening. I am sure that when the Belgrade UDBA archive is opened we will find several plans to kill Kennedy, the question is, was one of them impčimented IRL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much my feeling. The rabid anti-communists in America would <em>never</em> have let it go if there was even a little bit of evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth pointing out, however, that Tito&#39;s Yugoslavia was <em>not</em> part of the Soviet Bloc. Tito actively rejected Stalinism by promoting a &quot;go your own way&quot; approach to communism, which on the one hand earned him some Soviet assassins, and on the other hand the goodwill of the West. Yugoslavia wasn&#39;t so much behind the Iron Curtain as it was sitting astride it as a founding member of the Non-Aligned nations and I think it&#39;s fair to say that Tito&#39;s Yugoslavia served as a guide for modern day China&#39;s free-market communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you said &quot;prove me wrong&quot; and at that point it is assumed that you took the position that your statement is fact. It is very easy to prove your wrong since there isn&#39;t a shred of evidence to support your claims. You took events that did happen and there is evidence of (JFK assassination, Tito&#39;s statement about attempted assassination) and then connected them just by writing them in the same sentence nothing else.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t food for thought it is brain diarrhea until you are able to provide evidence of a connection from Tito to JFK&#39;s assassination.</p>

<p>As well no evidence exists of a Yugoslavia space program, someone made a short clip some 5 years ago that a documentary was about to be released about it but has since been fruitless. </p>

<p>I will believe the assassination and the space program once there is tangible evidence of it even some what evidence from which hints at something else, I&#39;m not one to shy away from conspiracy theories but the leaps needed to make the connection you did is too much for me.</p>
