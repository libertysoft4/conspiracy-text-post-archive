<p>still the fact that the fbi confiscated his things upon death irks/scares me a bit. I mean what the fuck was really there?</p>

<p>yes, his most important stuff was committed to memory only, but something of value or importance to someone must have been in there.</p>

<p>they would only take it if something could be used by themselves, enemies, or be hidden/exposed.</p>

<p>but by this point it cant be that bad where they&#39;d still hide it if anyone bitched too loudly about it.</p>

<p>unless he really had created free energy or some shit.
but I doubt thats possible, without at least what we have today or even greater technology. the precision to make such complex machines would be insane, and require a lot of things (probably like nanotech) to even be plausable, even by a genius of his level. the materials he had to work with wouldve been severely lacking compared to labs today.</p>

<p>but something, something HAD to be in there. even if it wasnt the death ray, or something. I feel like wahtever it was is probably important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One popular theory is that he invented a way to make it so that the output of his Wardenclyffe tower was greater than the input, and also could be transmitted wirelessly. So essentially if you put in 1000kw through the tower, you could transmit 1000kw to New York, and ALSO 1000kw to Hong Kong. The implications of this are vast. No more fossil fuels, cars that run wirelessly on electricity requiring no charge. Carefully placed &quot;nodes&quot; around major cities and along roadways could ensure abundant energy wherever you go, no charging, no cords. Imagine the industries of control that would collapse if this technology was released.</p>

<p>You have a good heart, but the people in charge don&#39;t see it this way.  Greed doesn&#39;t mean just having abundance. It means having <em>more</em> than everyone else.  It appears that the powers that be don&#39;t just want <em>more</em>, they want <em>all</em>.  </p>

<p>I think Tesla&#39;s problem was he was born in a time where money is/was more important that human progress.  Edison wanted to put a meter on the technology and charge people for it. Tesla went straight to free wireless energy.  Made sense to him, but not for the economics of his time. That&#39;s the problem with capitalism.  You have to milk a technology in long drawn out stages over time to maximize your profits.  They wouldn&#39;t go from an iPhone 1 to an iPhone 6 in next version.  </p>

<p>Shit, I remember being in Paris back in 1999.  They had those <a href="https://paymentdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/chip-n-pin.jpg">cards with chips</a> in them <em>back then</em>.  <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/19/article-0-0B417223000005DC-358_468x286.jpg">The waiter would even walk up to the table with a little hand held card reader/receipt printer.</a>  You would just slide your card in and enter your pin. Bam!  Done.  WTF isn&#39;t this in restaurants in the USA 16 years later?  Makes me wonder if we could really have flying cars by now.</p>

<p>Then why do the criminal psychopaths tend to do so well in this system? Serious question, not trying to start a pissing match. The first answer that comes to my mind is the collusion of government and corporate power, known by another name as &quot;fascism&quot;.  </p>

<p>In other words, the reason the criminal psychopaths tend to do so well is that we live, not in a capitalist system, but in a fascist system, and an increasingly global one at that. I would even go so far to say that you can&#39;t have a truly free market so long as government exists.</p>

I&#39;m not sure the doco even mentioned Tesla, but it made the case that the those particular UFOs are electric anti-gravity vehicles, flown by the USAF, that produce a kind of Alcubierre effect and are of a very Earthly origin. The timeline fits perfectly: within a decade of confiscating his research people were reporting UFOs on a regular basis, just as they had been reporting them on an irregular basis ever since the turn of the century when he apparently patented a flying saucer.</p>
