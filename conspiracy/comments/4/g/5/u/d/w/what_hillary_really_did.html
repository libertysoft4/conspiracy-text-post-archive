        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many people are wondering why Hillary&#39;s in trouble over her emails. There&#39;s basically a clique of loyal Americans in the intelligence community that are going after her, and may have enough power to land her in jail.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason that is not being dish closed to the public, you&#39;d have to be an insider to know it.</p>

<p>The Israelis have a spy for the last few decades, very, very high up in the U.S government. His identity is unknown, but his codename has been found out.
The codename is &quot;MEGA&quot;. There&#39;s supposedly only a few people in the mossad that are trusted to know who MEGA is.</p>

<p>US intelligence thinks they figured MEGA out. They think its Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>They think setting up the private class shoddy email server and placing tons of classified info on it was her way of passing info to the Israelis and provided her with plausible deniability.</p>

<p>There is a quiet, secret war going on between the Jewish community and the rest of the American intelligence community. Obama, a hereditary CIA agent who happens to be Jewish, is caught SO much, right in the middle of what to do with her! Pardon, or throw to the wolves....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?</p>

<p>&quot;In his 2006 book The Audacity of Hope Obama wrote, &quot;I was not raised in a religious household ... My mother&#39;s own experiences ... only reinforced this inherited skepticism. Her memories of the Christians who populated her youth were not fond ones ... And yet for all her professed secularism, my mother was in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I&#39;ve ever known.&quot;[69] &quot;Religion for her was &quot;just one of the many ways—and not necessarily the best way—that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives,&quot; Obama wrote.[70]</p>

<p>&quot;She felt that somehow, wandering through uncharted territory, we might stumble upon something that will, in an instant, seem to represent who we are at the core. That was very much her philosophy of life—to not be limited by fear or narrow definitions, to not build walls around ourselves and to do our best to find kinship and beauty in unexpected places.&quot;</p>

<p>Dunham&#39;s daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, when asked later if her mother was an atheist, said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have called her an atheist. She was an agnostic. She basically gave us all the good books—the Bible, the Hindu Upanishads and the Buddhist scripture, the Tao Te Ching—and wanted us to recognize that everyone has something beautiful to contribute.&quot;[35] &quot;Jesus, she felt, was a wonderful example. But she felt that a lot of Christians behaved in un-Christian ways.&quot;[70] On the other hand, Maxine Box, Dunham&#39;s best friend in high school, said that Dunham &quot;touted herself [then] as an atheist, and it was something she&#39;d read about and could argue. She was always challenging and arguing and comparing. She was already thinking about things that the rest of us hadn&#39;t.&quot;[7]&quot;</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure they&#39;re all just lying like Jews, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you are saying that Obama&#39;s mother couldn&#39;t be Jewish because she was atheist. If that is not what you are saying then I am genuinely sorry for my poor reading comprehension. If it is what you are saying then I am not sorry. There are a lot of atheist Jews in the world, and most people who have a problem with Jews have a problem with their ethnicity, not their religion or culture.</p>

<p>As an aside I am not defending the idea of her being Jewish. It is a popular rumor with no supporting evidence.</p>
