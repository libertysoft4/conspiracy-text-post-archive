        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing alot of thinking about this.  Hopfully you guys don&#39;t bash me for sharing my thoughts.</p>

<p>Fear.. You know, if you think about it, it&#39;s probably one of the greatest weapons.  Everyone is born with it and it can be used against you.  Let me make an example really quick.  </p>

<p>A young boy is walking in the hallway at his school. We&#39;ll call him boy1.  Another boy(who is about twice his size) walks up to him.  Lets call him boy2.  </p>

<p>Boy2:  &quot;Hey dip-shit, give me your money.&quot;
Boy1:  &quot;Why would I do that?&quot;
Boy2:  &quot;Because if you don&#39;t, I&#39;m going to kick your ass. Then I&#39;m going to tell that girl you like in 3rd hour you tried to make out with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Boy1, not wanting to get hurt or shamed, hands over his money to Boy2.  Why?  Because of fear.  I&#39;m not saying everybody goes through that senario, but people do.  The thing about fear is that it can be used to control you, whether you want to do that action or not.  Now fear isn&#39;t always a bad thing.  If you can face that fear and push past it, than you have just made yourself a better person.  </p>

<p>Some people however, choose to just hide from that fear.  They choose to ignore it and shut it out of their lives.  Now what does that do for them?  Absolutly nothing as they are still afraid.  The thing about it though is it will always catch up to them.  </p>

<p>So before you smash that downvote button, I want You to ask yourself something.  When the time comes when someone threatens to take something from you.  Anything.  Your money, your freedom, your personal items.  Will you be afraid?  Will you run?  Or will you stand up for yourself and what you believe in and face that fear?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s some valuable insight, but the only thing I add is that sometimes hiding from a source of fear can be a form of tactical retreat until you are better prepared to face it. Hiding from a source of fear can weaken its resolve, or cause it draw itself out and expose it&#39;s own weaknesses, or throw it off guard when it is expecting you to fight.</p>

<p>Sometime direct confrontation and fighting isn&#39;t necessarily the optimal choice. But as you have so astutely noted, one should always be aware of what they fear and to be prepared to confront it lest they find it is controlling them. Sometimes confronting fear means not attacking it head on, but addressing it asymmetrically or disarming it with a change of tactics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think fear is definitely a big part of the puzzle piece.  But, in my opinion, the type of fear caused by immediate physical danger (Say when someone says give me your wallet and iPhone or die) is <em>not</em> the same as not doing anything to confront the subconscious fear of governmental &#39;cryptocratic&#39; rampant bullying.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are just using this as an easy example to relate to, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful or beneficial in any way to risk your life over monetary possessions.  In your example, you happened to pick two things which may not be worth fighting for... and only appear to be worth fighting for due to societal programming (money and &quot;shame&quot;)</p>

<p>Shame is caused solely by oneself.  The world can be laughing at you thinking you are gay and you could feel no shame.  The same with this boy who has his money stolen and the girl he likes potentially thinking he is queer (most likely wouldn&#39;t fall for the latter though)</p>

<p>So, should he have accepted a punch in the nose?  Perhaps disfiguring him for months?  Or even the small risk of permanent damage?  Falling to the ground and bashing his head against the concrete?</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for confronting and exposing the big &quot;ignoble lies&quot; that, in the short term, seem to give many illusory comfort (the government protects us and doesn&#39;t lie, and we supposedly have less to fear because of it ... but are unhelpful, harmful deceptions in the medium and long term.  Of course (!) the cognitive dissonance of the general public is gigantic since the government, media and intelligence agencies also force-feed us fearful, mostly imaginary tales... </p>

<p>We need to pick our battles. Although I do think our society is injected with a fear of death and non/mortal injury, and we need to overcome that to be able to bring this world back to sanity, we can&#39;t stupidly allow ourselves to be harmed without a plan, and certainly without obtaining tangible benefit.</p>

<p>Fear certainly can be better understood by the collective society and that will allow them to make better choices.   Some psychedelics would help many here....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that.  I just used that example as something the common man can relate to.  The moral is not to let fear take control.  If you cannot control your fear, you cannot control yourself.</p>

<p>Btw, I agree with the whole psychedelics thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Figured that was just a toy example.</p>

<p>And yea I (think) I can tell a lot by people I know/meet who are &quot;afraid&quot; of experimenting with psychedelics.  The are afraid of their mind.  Afraid of potential skeletons being found in their closet.  Afraid of the unknown.  This is exactly the territory we need to confront in order to enact any change and deviate from the status quo of society (akin to the &quot;status quo&quot; of everyday waking normal consciousness) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. If it comes down to it, and my life is threatened I will fight that fear. Don&#39;t get me wrong though because I do have fears about certain things, but I fight that fear because if no one else is going to fight it for me who is? It&#39;s a battle that I have to face, and whether I face it alone or not. I am not afraid to lose my life over something I believe is right. I hate being a coward. There&#39;s a quote from the game God Of War III that I played a long time ago, and this quote sticks out to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hope is what makes us strong. It is why we are here. It was what we fight with when all else is lost.&quot;</p>

<p>So yeah. When push comes to shove I will fight for my life and those around me if they chose to. I stand for what is right, and I always will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree. My point was only about picking one&#39;s battles.  If it&#39;s a losing one with little to gain by one&#39;s sacrifice, what&#39;s the point?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take an extreme (non toy-example)</p>

<p>Those who light themselves on fire committing suicide in order to raise awareness about a cause do it because there is good chance there is something really wrong about society in which they want to make sure others know about.  (At least this is how I imagine it.)  In this case there is usually something or someone pushing around the society in which the self-immolator is part of.  And that is his/her response.  Really crazy, right?  The symbolism attempting to be portrayed is something like &quot;You are BURNING us. And although I feel and know it, others do not or do not take it seriously, but serious it is...&quot;  Here, &quot;mirror neurons&quot; and empathy are activated when someone sees someone else burning alive.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the self-immolator may even be fearful of death (or not) but they&#39;ve certainly overcome that fear.  And I am proud there are humans which have destroyed their ego so greatly and are willing to sacrifice their life for a cause they feel so strongly about.  When all of our natural instinct is telling one otherwise.</p>

<p>Reminds me of Homeboy Sandman&#39;s Illuminati song.  I get chills just thinking about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;ll be afraid because they don&#39;t have any faith.<br/>
They&#39;ll claim that they believe but that is not how they behave<br/>
As money comes to power over power that&#39;s divine<br/>
they will all turn into cowards cause they&#39;re all afraid to die.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need less cowards; individuals who are willing to destroy their ego or have their ego destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the smaller guy ran through my legs, and as I leaned over to grab him he jumped on my back and started choking me from behind. Very much what happened in the Princess Bride as a matter of fact. It was embarrassing, but lessons were learned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.... I don&#39;t dwell on it. It was slightly less embarrassing than the time some little guy pulled my shirt up over my head and punched me silly. When I tried to fight back I punched the wall and my watch band broke and my watch went flying across the room. Ah...the good old days...</p>
