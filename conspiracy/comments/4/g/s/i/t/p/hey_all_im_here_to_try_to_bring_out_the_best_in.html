        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>I am a devoted conspiracy theorist as we obviously all are. Here is a simple fact they basically deem to be conspiracy theory, they claim there are bad health effects behind it. They do not incorporate it into modern health or science.</p>

<p>Fasting is a trick anyone can use to help their body. When I say anyone I mean absolutely anyone. I am a skinny person who has about 5% body fat. I use it to improve my brain power mainly. It helps me think faster, more actively, it makes me happier inside. The way I really notice it helps me is when people ask you a random question it takes a human a second to truly understand what they are saying and what the most appropriate answer is. Even when we say the most appropriate answer later we think of something better we could have said. I find after fasting not only can I think of my response better but I also think of better responses. It is also nice to know even when I don&#39;t eat for 40 hours I still have plenty of energy. </p>

<p>Fasting is also an anti aging mechanism. Fasting promotes cell repairing, eating promotes cell division. Sugar is like cell division on steroids.</p>

<p>For people who are looking to lose weight, fasting is helpful. My suggestion for those people is to eat smaller portions mainly and use fasting also. </p>

<p>Some other information that may benefit you is that herbs will help. Get rid of sugar as much as you possibly can. Smoke marijuana will help you lose weight. </p>

<p>The true trick of this is, if you fast and keep a positive attitude even when starving you can have revelations about the world. The conspiracies may come together for those who are looking. Good luck my friends and remember life is a path you start somewhere and your goal is to finish higher or better than where you started.</p>

<p>Thanks for the read sorry about my formatting and writing skills. </p>

<p>This is my opinion I am just trying to help others discover fasting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One who has found enlightenment is naturally humbled by such knowledge. A truly humbled soul who has found enlightenment would not be so callous to use it to defend oneself. In fact, an enlightened person thinks everyone except himself to be enlightened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This holds some water. Fact is, the moment you announce you are humble it loses it&#39;s appeal. A truly enlightened person is modest, and will not gloat or flaunt a higher sense of understanding. The fact is, to be enlightened is a personal experience, and when described to others it sounds like normal perception, and in turn takes away from the actuality.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve reached a higher understanding, congratulations. Just know: the more you come to understand, the more you realise you dont understand anything in comparison to the ammount of knowledge to be known. It will drive you crazy, which is where being humble has its usage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite the contrary, although there is always something to learn it is clear to see a lot of you are desperate for knowledge but have ears that do not hear. The only thing that keeps me humble is knowing I&#39;ll get shut up like all before me. Reaching enlightenment means you want everyone else to reach it also. If some of you are too ignorant and would prefer to attack me so be it. You are nothing, I am nothing. But most definitely you are nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;One who is equal toward the desirable and the undesirable; who is steady, situated equally well in <strong>praise and blame, honor and dishonor</strong>; who treats alike both friend and enemy; and who has renounced all material activities—such a person is said to have transcended mundane consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>Thank you for the input. I choose to be who I am, Buddha is definitely higher than I currently am. Although you and I are talking about irrelevant bullshit I can just tell by your attempted grasp of control over me that you do not deserve my respect. </p>

<p>Buddha was okay with everything and he is trying to teach it to you. I am okay with everything but I am desperately trying to make you realize everything you are fighting for means nothing. I am a thought, an awake person in a crazy time, being lectured by some fool.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps you get a better grasp. If you need help writing about your anti-jerking off posts or your quotes of Buddha just let me know. God forbid we do anything with our bodies. Bless me father I&#39;m a sinner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At a very introspective point in my life, I used fasting a lot. I would agree that it did make me feel more dexterous, both in body and mind. </p>

<p>If I would like to introduce the practice back into my life, what would be the most beneficial sort of practice? I&#39;m not particularly religious, and that&#39;s what fasting has always been associated with in my experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It is incorporated with religion, they mostly do a fast that involves eating while the suns down, starving while the suns up. The best fasts in my opinion are water only, or maybe with certain herbs to clean the body. They break the fast too quickly in my opinion and don&#39;t get the benefits of a clear thinking mind. I find my mind fogs back up basically right away if I eat processed food or sugar. </p>

<p>Also if you are going to drink water while you fast get good clean fluoride free water if you can! :)</p>

<p>Also to answer your question I would suggest you don&#39;t eat at all for a full day, when you wake up the next day or even when you are going to bed that night you will feel energized. Your mind will think faster, your body will move quicker, you will have no emotional burden.</p>

<p>People like eating vitamins and stuff when they fast, I&#39;m going to be the black sheep and say everything the government feeds us is actually bad for us so just go natural and eat no pills.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post. I coincidentally started heavily researching fasting as of late to change some things about myself. I&#39;m a skinny guy that is trying to put on pounds and I&#39;m rounding that down to improper nutrient uptake due to low stomach acid. I&#39;ve been looking into fasting to reset and heal my entire digestive system/immunes system with the intent to get more out of my food.</p>

<p>Spiritually I&#39;m interested in what fasting can do for me. I have a spiritual block of sorts but I&#39;m very open to becoming more so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the perfect spot for you then friend. I also have trouble with my digestive track, I&#39;d say stay away from coffee, sugar and milk for a bit. Fasting will help a lot. Fasting improve brain power and gives you more stress resistance! It should help you all around. Doing one fast brings so many noticeable benefits it will be up to you to decide how often to fast. Personally I use it whenever I feel like it. All this talking about fasting made me start my fast a few hours ago. I would describe the perfect fast as happy, clear thinking, not easily distracted. Just fast and drink some alcohol with it if you wish. It is nothing but good in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends what you are searching for. After you fast a few times your body get&#39;s conditioned to it. I would say listen to your senses. If you are light headed before having a sip of alcohol, you probably shouldn&#39;t drink, and should eat a little to take the edge off. If you are okay and feel energized do as you please.</p>

<p>There is fear mongering everywhere. What is there really to be afraid of? We are humans we are smart, I&#39;m sure you or I could determine what our bodies are capable of. My goal is probably hallucinations at this point. </p>

<p>If your goal is to have a more open mind to possibility there is no need to drink. I would suggest you fast a couple times for 24 hours and feel what it&#39;s like. It&#39;s weird at first starving and all, but after a fast or 2 you really realize it doesn&#39;t matter and that we are high on sugar every day. Do as you please the trick is fasting and being happy. Using those 2 mechanisms you can truly look at the bad things going on in our lives and reflect.</p>

<p>For example, some people see themselves being perfect as</p>

<p>Working, working out, going out with friends, partying, and sleeping, and a classic woman pass time is shopping. On the opposite side of the spectrum guys want to have the best, so they spend the extra money. I am not saying be stingy and buy crap, I&#39;m saying really use the enlightenment to determine what life is really about.  </p>

<p>Even those 4 things with no hobbies can take your entire life away by consuming all of your time. Working, driving, eating, watching TV, going on social media, I probably just described 90% of many peoples lives. Do those things truly matter? Is it important? I found we live in a sort of game really. Some get sucked into the game while other&#39;s choose to play certain parts of it. Knowing you don&#39;t have to play any of it is the flip side.</p>

<p>Fast and determine what really matters to you in this world. Or what doesn&#39;t matter to you at all. Using that knowledge you can drop certain things you don&#39;t particularly enjoy doing, thus freeing up more time and continuing the cycle of filling time. For me, I played a lot of League of legends. I found that it brought out bad characteristics in me and now I enjoy playing it about 10% of what I used to, but I enjoy that 10% much much more.</p>

<p>So early on, on my trip through the dimensions, I chose to do nothing and use the internet to research everything I possibly could. Then I would spend the rest of my time with friends. I made no money in those 5 months and basically lived off ramen. Some may call that a waste of 5 months, but that is their logic so I will leave them to it. For all I care the information I have learned beats anything else in the world. Even presidency now that I know he&#39;s a puppet. </p>

<p>Thanks for the read, just remember there are kids who are striving to become president, or soldiers, or even crime fighters. A quick perspective change can make you realize those are some shitty ass jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been fasting for about 6 months now. I sleep for about 8 hours, then I skip breakfast (only drink black coffee, nothing with calories that will trigger my stomach to anticipate more food) and don&#39;t eat for another 8 hours. I did this mostly to lower my bf% from around 18% to near 12 or 13% now. I can actually see my abs for the first time ever, it&#39;s great. </p>

<p>I can elaborate more if someone is curious, but this kind of 16 hour long fast is great for me because it&#39;s taking advantage of the bodies natural fuel burning mechanisms. If you have a belly full of food, the energy burned will be taken from those calories. However, if you&#39;re in the fasted state (which begins after 5 hours of not eating) your body has no choice but to burn your stored fat cells for fuel. I also lift weights on an empty stomach (drink bcaas before hand to help keep your muscles from breaking down) then eat lots of protein afterwards (chicken breast, turkey burgers...lean meats) this way I&#39;m burning my fat off while still making my muscles grow. My results have been slow but steady. </p>

<p>My first week of fasting was rough, but once my body got used to it and my hormones found their new Ryhthyms, fasting daily like this is easy. I prefer it now and consider it my life style not a diet. </p>

<p>How this relates to conspiracy? Well the truth is if you want to slim down you must consume fewer calories them you burn a day. This means less people spending money on food. Which is bad for business. Imagine if the nation woke up to healthy eating and portion control. McDs would lose money. Walmart would lose money. Coke would lose money. It&#39;s in the corporations best interest to keep us on huge portions and slow lazy and mentally foggy. When honestly out bodies are our temples and the food we put in them should be treated with a certain level of scrutiny and care. </p>

<p>The older I get the more I feel like the general population suffers due to the typical crap food and large portions they consume. You don&#39;t need a large coke. Skip the fries. Get the burger with lettuce wrap skip the buns. Etc. end rant </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I believe it fits in with conspiracy because they attempt to hide the benefits. It seems fasting could be a cure to many known illnesses and is great at preventing illness. Thanks for the body of information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fast and drink wine (as natural as you can find). You&#39;ll thank me. This was the point. You&#39;ll enter a state of enlightenment. Don&#39;t over do it though! If you are puking, you are  doing it wrong. Find your balance. The blood and body of Christ is not literal. Just my pro-tip (ex-Catholic).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I was not religious in my life but after reaching enlightenment you&#39;d be foolish not to at least understand the holy books.</p>

<p>I will try fasting and drinking wine, usually I just fast and smoke a little. Drinking and fasting can be a good stepping stone before I attempt to go any further.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input as always PLC.</p>

<p>Christ consciousness is a thing I just wish people wanted it, I&#39;d be handing it out like candy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may seem morbid, but alcohol works for those who have seen death (I have). Substances work on others more than others. I&#39;m not promoting smoking over drinking. But, 1 helps the other more. I&#39;ve done both. Just get to find your balance. What helps you (embrace it)... I say fuck those who say alcohol is bad, fuck, try absinthe.... Weed cannot compare. Cheers mate! Peace and love! Find your balance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alcohol when used properly will give you the same effect. You just need to be in the right mind set (I&#39;m the equivalent of ~8 bottles of wine in). I&#39;ve tripped harder on pure alcohol than any weed/hallucinogen (that shit makes me paranoid). Different strokes, for different blokes... We are not the same, and my Slavic blood comes into the picture. Experiment with all, do not damn one over the other. That is just my message...</p>
