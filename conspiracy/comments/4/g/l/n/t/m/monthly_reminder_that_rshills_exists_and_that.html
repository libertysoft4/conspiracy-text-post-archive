    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></p>

<p>In case you missed it, I will spell it out loud and clear, please pay attention! This will not sit well with the administrators or moderators!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> r/Conspiracy has methodically been introduced to C3ns0rsh!p policies under the guise of p0lit!cal c0rrectne55, thereby slowly cooking the proverbial frog. Since Reddit was bought by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a> it has moved towards a more mainstream corporate mass media style of c3ns0rsh!p, !nf0rmati0n c0ntr0l and p|20paganda. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> All of Reddit, including  r/Conspiracy, now has a fully automatized algorithm system in place to detect and c3ns0r any n3gat!ve/revealing/damaging information about the US !ntelligence C0mmun!ty, US government, corporations, financial industry and key political figures. The algorithms scan for specific words, wordings and flagged links to alternative media outlets. If an undesirable element is detected, the system will automatically remove or discretely r!g the vot!ng pr0cess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> As many of us has already notices, if you post something <del>controversial</del> truthful about the 9-11 attacks, illegal NSA surveillance, crimes committed by the CIA/FBI/Law enforcement agencies, financial crimes, economical inequality or US war crimes and genocides it will properly not end up the front page. And let us not forget the legions 5h!lls and 9und!ts. Reddit  controls the process minute by minute, the slip ups are getting fewer and far between, and they refine their already sophisticated methods for every day that passes by. The days when you could easily detect hamfisted blatant c3nsorsh!p attempts are over. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> The first thing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a> did was to introduce a new and marvelous CE0, then they proceeded to removed all the troublesome administrators, after which they continued the process and removed all the undesirable moderators. And there was much drama!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5)</em></strong> Then the ban-wagon finally hit the r/conspiracy forum, deliberately purging the intelligentsia, people who tended to post quality posts with lots of data and statistics, during and shortly after the height of the Mr. 5n0wd3n scandal, thus turning the forum into an echo camper for fools and idiots.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>6)</em></strong> Since the &quot;great purges&quot; the r/conspiracy forum has been absolutely spammed with racist anti-Jewish posts, often making up 20% of the volume on the front page, and the moderators are doing absolute nothing about it. On top of that legions of 9und!ts and 5H!ll5 has been allowed to down vote and 5pam any undesirable posts.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>And this, my friends, is how the 0l!garch5 control r/conspiracy forum. This is how the 0l!garch5 has taken control of all the c0rp0rat3 0wn3d ma55 m3d! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that reddit is full of propaganda from all sides and that this sub isn&#39;t immune to it, but at least one of your points is just blatantly false.  Specifically #2, there is no &quot;fully automatized algorithm system in place&quot; on this sub to remove posts.  If you have any evidence of one by all means, let&#39;s see it.  I know that you don&#39;t have any though, because nothing like that exists here.  The only thing comparable which maybe has you confused is reddit&#39;s sitewide automod which does automatically remove posts from certain websites (like naturalnews, infowars, etc.).  We approve all of those posts manually though and are one of the very few subs that do.</p>

<p><em>Exactly,</em> but you are only scratching the surface. Downplaying the fact itself? </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> In certain forums, if you use certain word or phrases, tested by multiple independent sources, you post will automatically get the &quot;treatment&quot;. This is not theory or conspiracy, this has been proven again and again and again, pretending otherwise is just borderline r@@@@@@d.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Blocking none corporate new media outlets might be the most blatant form of censorship. This is how the owners of Reddit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a> keep the official narrative of the corporate owned mass media going, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Why have a voting mechanism at all ... I might as well get drunk and watch Fox News?!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> Armies, hordes and legions of sh!lls and Pund!ts. One or two years ago happened from time to time, I fondly remember a few times when I raised a voice of concern against Mansanto pesticides often resulting in -50 down votes within the hour, nowadays they are more sophisticated and subtle in their methods. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> I have seen with my own eyes and talked to people getting banned for posting information about the intelligence community and their crimes against the American people. About 2-3 weeks later the censors finally gave up and the &quot;Snowden scandal&quot; broke the headlines. Absolutely abhorrent censorship. I almost quit Reddit that day. The rest is history...  </p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>We will never know. (Personally) I don&#39;t think the lowly moderators are part of the inner circle, they are just useful idiots, happy amateurs doodling around. God bless them. </p></li>
<li><p>I can see that 10-20% of the volume on the front page, more or less all the time, is nothing more than racist anti-Jewish slurs. The moderators never touch them. But I can assure you that if you post something new and revealing from the &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;independent&quot; media about the most recent crime spree of the TBTF financial institutions, you will not reach the front page easily. Or about the USA, Turkey or Saudi Arabia transporting soldiers, ammunition, supplies and weapons into Syria. Or about the NSA committing crimes, covering up crimes or lying about them under oath. Or Google/Apple/Microsoft/Reddit applying 100% and working together with the NSA. </p></li>

<p>It is a painful process of dumping down the conversation, reducing it to trivia, sports and celebrity gossip, and sparing the feelings of the supposedly opinionated majority. I guess I differentiate myself by actually trusting &quot;the people&quot; and opposing censorship. I know... crazy!   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but mods have no impact on what reaches the front page and what doesn&#39;t.  That&#39;s dependent on the voting or some hidden mechanism that only the admins would know about (like if they weight the votes differently for certain subjects or something).  Now obviously the voting on reddit as a whole and also on this sub is being manipulated and isn&#39;t reliable, and certain groups or marketers or shills or whoever else can and do influence what makes it to the top and what doesn&#39;t, but that isn&#39;t the mods&#39; fault.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>What I know is this:</em></strong> I made some research. The front page of r/conspiracy is nothing more than a sad sad parody of its former self. Strictly speaking I don&#39;t know if it is an algorithm or a very very zealous Administrator. In the end it doesn&#39;t matter, the outcome remains the exact same.  </p></li>
<li><p>I have spoken to a few moderators about censorship. Most of them seemed fairly ... indifferent and ignorant ... they couldn&#39;t care less.

<p>I think it&#39;s an active campaign from one or more groups to upvote certain posts and bury others.  I don&#39;t know how organized it is or who the people doing the voting are, but the manipulation of vote totals is widespread and quite obvious.  There&#39;s a reason the top post is always something about political theater or race relations or police brutality or any other divisive, surface-level topic.  I think there are people who have programs to control multiple accounts and use them to brigade certain threads.  Some probably have some type of technology that alerts them to certain keywords too, so for example anything about 9/11 maybe gets an auto 5 downvotes when it&#39;s posted.  I have no proof of any of this but it&#39;s my best guess based on the evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just too easy to manipulate votes on this site for us to assume it isn&#39;t being done.  And then add all of the evidence of vote manipulation and online shilling and it&#39;s impossible for anyone with their eyes open to deny.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>The obvious assumption is that it&#39;s either these entities themselves or people/groups doing their bidding for them.  Spooks are everywhere, shills are everywhere, &quot;marketers&quot; and propagandists are everywhere.  I mean... who else would it be who wants to censor that info if not the people who are implicated by it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does this kind of censorship coincide so well with the corporate owned mass medias own agenda?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the same entities above own the mass media as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are the parties involved in this sort of censorship able to coordinate their efforts so well?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they have all the money and technology in the world and are highly organized and compartmentalized.  reddit is also a very easy site to spread propaganda on because all the users are anonymous and what gets seen is determined by voting which can also be done anonymously and uses algorithms that only the admins and developers have access to.  And if you have the software to do it you could easily control 5, 10, 20 accounts yourself and help guide the narrative however you wanted to.  Now imagine a team of people with this same software and you can imagine how easy it would be to influence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who pay for it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The military/banking/industrial/intelligence complex probably, the same &quot;who&quot; from your first bullet point.  And ultimately you and I probably pay for a lot of it with our own tax money.</p>

<p>Most of this has been pretty obvious to me for a long time with regards to reddit - why are you asking me these questions?  Maybe I&#39;m missing something.</p>
