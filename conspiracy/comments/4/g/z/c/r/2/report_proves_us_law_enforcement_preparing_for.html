        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A new report from analysts with industry research group, Sandler Research, forecasts the Global Riot Control System Market for the next four years — but beyond a burgeoning market to parallel the expanding global police state, it appears world governments are also keenly aware of civilian discontent. Sandler predicts the market will have an annual growth of 3.5 percent, and makes a telling juxtaposition, emphases added, involving the United States:</p>

<p>“Law enforcement agencies around the world are the biggest market for riot control systems. This market is expected to generate revenues of over USD 3.5 billion by the end of 2020. Countries such as the U.S., Iran, Egypt, Russia, China, and Thailand have started procuring riot control equipment and are investing heavily in [non-lethal weapons]. Moreover, special vehicles that are equipped with water cannon and reservoirs have been designed for security personnel, for use in areas of conflict to handle large crowds and demonstration. Demand for such equipment is expected to rise during the next few years.”</p>

<p>Note the last sentence in its truncated time frame.</p>

<p>Specifically, the analysts continue:</p>

<p>“In North America, the prominent markets are Canada and the U.S. and law enforcement agencies in these nations are best equipped with the upgraded weapons. The militarization of the police department and other law enforcement agencies in the Americas has encouraged the use of advanced riot control equipment.”</p>

<p>While swaths of the country debate the finer points of which lesser evil should take the helm of the corporate plutocracy, various U.S. law enforcement agencies have been gearing up for the virtually inevitable unrest both during and following those elections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed how we have been brain washed with tv to think that heros are soldiers. Like all the recruitment commercials are like become a hero join the military. So bieng a hero is getting weponized and pushing a political agenda on a group of people/killing people. Heros are people like captain planet and hurcules. People who do the right thing people who make it thier lifes purpose to help others and make others quality of life better and people who give up thier life to show others the truth like snowden. Idk what made me go off about this kinda off topic lol.</p>

If they don&#39;t know, then it wouldn&#39;t act as a deterrent unless something serious does happen, and I&#39;m talking big time.  By then it&#39;d be too late to riot anyway.</p>
