<p>I have emailed Ziggi Zugam asking about what happened, but he has not been active on any internet forums recently, so I don&#39;t know if he will talk to anybody about it. There is no other information other than the few short words on the website. I am still skeptical of the idea that Mark Basile could be a mere scam artist, but the evidence shows that he is at least lazy.</p>

<p>About two months ago, the website had this message:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Mark received a new dust sample a couple of months ago and I know he started some work picking out things to study, meaning chips etc, and I know he continues to study samples in his spare time. He helped Richard Gage et al out at a recent conference, in Boston if I recall correctly, doing a couple of shifts at the AE911 booth, so he is still active in 911 truth, as much as time allows, and he did tell Richard that he is still working on the study. At the time he had not sent out samples for independent lab testing, but I do not know if something of that sort has happened since.</em></p>

<p><em>I can tell you that Mark will most likely not be giving us regular updates, in the form of little progress reports, as we had initially planned. It just seems as if keeping any kind of schedule is not really an option for Mark, presumably due to time constraints. He did say at some point a few months ago that he was planning to take a little vacation to sort out the study, but that has not happened yet, as far as I know.</em></p>

<p><em>It has always been extremely difficult to reach Mark but in recent months he has been even more reclusive than normal, and I suspect that a series of email/phone calling spamming from people I won&#39;t mention is responsible for that.</em></p>

<p><em>We will certainly notify our readers whenever we have something...and I would love to be able to give you some sort of a promise for results within a certain time-frame but I will have to refrain given past experience.</em></p>

<p><em>Last autumn Mark sounded like he was about to make a big push to get things done but then some things got in the way, and again he indicated to Richard in Boston that he is about to get things done...but still no news.</em></p>

<p><em>Personally I am fairly optimistic that he will have results for us this year, but I am not making any promises.</em></p>

<p><em>I hope this helps.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>The latest update could very well mean that the dust samples and donation money could end up in the hands of someone who can competently pay a lab to do tests on the red/gray chips, which have been suspected to be made of nano-thermite. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Ziggi Zugam has emailed me back. He says that basically the person running markbasile.org is just being a douchebag and Mark Basile has not withdrawn from the project. </p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. <strong>But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb,</strong> respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. <strong>Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</strong></p>

 on nanothermites, goes on to say that “Superthermites can increase the
 (chemical) reaction time by a thousand times … resulting in a very rapid reactive
 wave … used in many applications, including … explosive devices.”
The article says that such nanoenergetics enable “building more lethal
 weapons such as cave-buster bombs that have several times the

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your enthusiasm and admission that thermite can in fact be explosive, but I didn&#39;t really need four separate responses. They are a bit all over the place. </p>

<p>So I&#39;ll choose your first comment here and respond in general. I haven&#39;t seen enough quality evidence from Woods/the nuke/direct energy camp to be convinced. I&#39;m not sure if she was one the pushing the cancer theories but I shouldn&#39;t have to correct that info myself like I did with the benzene.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t matter if the article doesn&#39;t believe that benzene was prevalent. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was absolutely measured and verifiable. It was there.</p></li>
<li><p>Jet fuel isn&#39;t the only source of benzene.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As the primary author of the published paper explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this scenario, the extreme levels of VOCs would be the result of the complete thermal degradation of all plastic materials in the thermitic (incendiary) fires.  In normal structural fires with limited ventilation, plastic materials often burn incompletely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the non-quality information I have seen woods et al present had been refuted.</p>

<p><strong>Our assessment of the claim that tritium found in a split water sample collected in WTC 6 is evidence that nuclear blasts occurred at the WTC</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Up to 3.7 nanocuries of tritium per liter of water was found in a split water sample that was collected in basement level 5 of WTC 6 on September 21, 2001. Compared with the typical background level of 0.1-0.2 nanocurie tritium per liter water, the amount of tritium in the split water sample is clearly elevated, but tritium levels up to two orders of magnitude higher than
in the WTC water samples are common in leachate of municipal 
solid waste sites and in landfill gas condensates (see quote/screen shot in footnote 66)</p>

<p>The materials and the debris at the WTC site included common tritium sources. WTC 6 housed two weapon vaults of the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) that contained weapons with tritium night sights.</p>

<p>The amount of tritium in the three tritium lights of a typical new night sight adds up to about 54 millicuries. Many of the weapons stored in WTC 6 could have been mechanically damaged and/or subjected to high temperatures on September 11 
and/or in the following days, thereby releasing their tritium into the environment. Only a part of the tritium from broken gun sights might end up in water under the conditions that existed at the WTC site. Considering this, and assuming, as several 
authors suggest, that the WTC 6 split water sample is representative of the 30 million gallons of water that were pumped out of the main WTC area between September 11 and the day the WTC 6 sample was collected, the tritium level measured in the WTC 6 split water sample is still readily explicable. One only needs to assume that the tritium night sights of some of the weapons stored in the AFT vaults were damaged. Additional tritium sources also existed at the WTC site—notably in the night sights of weapons probably carried by some of the more than 60 police officers who lost their lives at the WTC.</p>

<p>The tritium detected in the WTC water samples is therefore not suspicious at all. Yet several authors present the elevated 5
tritium levels in the water samples as evidence that nuclear blasts occurred at the WTC. They use two alternative lines of reasoning. Both are compromised because common tritium sources are excluded from consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>They deliberately avoid mentioning the common tritium sources that existed at the WTC site and claim that “[t]ritiated 
water in any significant quantity is a telltale sign of a thermonuclear explosion.”</li>
</ul>

<p>This argument is not reasonable, given their exclusion of the common tritium sources and given the high tritium levels in 
leachate of municipal solid waste sites and in landfill gas condensates (see quote/screen shot in footnote 66). </p>

<ul>
<li>They concede that common tritium sources existed at the WTC but declare that any tritium from gun night sights is 
irrelevant: “The supposed Tritium level only significant source is the 34 Ci in the ‘commercial airliners.’”They make the reasonable assumption, supported by a reference, that the tritium from the airplanes must have evaporated almost completely during the fires, and they insist that only nuclear blasts can account for the tritium in the WTC 6 split water sample. Their
argument is not sound, because it rests on the exclusion of tritium from gun night sights.</li>
</ul>

<p>And again, it doesn&#39;t really make a difference if it&#39;s difficult to believe thermite was involved. It was discovered, peer reviewed and published. I don&#39;t need this many comments. You&#39;re up 5 now. Unnecessary. 1 peer reviewed, published paper would suffice</p>
