        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n4/full/nm.3820.html">http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n4/full/nm.3820.html</a></p>

<p>Yesterday, I began trying to share this information, and explain how the finding may be much more profound than initially realized by researchers.</p>

<p>In short, researchers cured type one diabetes in an animal model (T1D mice implanted with a small amount of human insulin cells), using an MAOI, commonly seen in shamanic rituals, Harmine (Syrian Rue, a plant containing Harmine, is also a candidate for the long lost Soma).</p>

<p>Researchers have lost interest, because regrowing insulin cells is only half of the battle... but what if it isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>Science has dogmatically held to the theory of A causing B, that a genetic error leads to the immune system attacking the body (this is a great framework if your goal is treatments that make money!).</p>

<p>I am proposing that this cure (yes, it WAS a cure to these mice) showed so much promise, because A doesn&#39;t cause B. I believe type one diabetes is a collection of symptoms due to a deficiency in a higher pathway. In which case, you can alleviate the symptoms of A and B, by finding X. This research, demonstrates we are FAR closer to X than science is admitting.. it is right in front of our faces. Harmine interacts directly with DNA, the effects of which are not well categorized. </p>

<p>I will demonstrate the power of this very simple concept, in exploring previous &quot;mysteries&quot;. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why is type one diabetes on the rise?</li>
</ol>

<p>If the disease is genetic, this could not be the case. However, if the disease has a genetic element, that predisposes someone to a failure in this neural cascade (due to environmental factors) this explains not only why this alkaloid shows such promise, but also explains why we cannot find a &quot;cure&quot; but only more advanced &quot;treatments&quot;.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why are there people who claim to cure their diabetes with X diet?</li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps specific diets may help people to produce the compound that is unexpressed in type one diabetics. Could the modern diet be contributing to the rise in type one diabetes? </p>

<ol>
<li>Why have type one diabetics DIED or have gone BLIND after using ayahuasca, yet type two diabetics are fine (consider, they may even be on the same insulin treatment depending on severity). </li>
</ol>

<p>With this framework in mind, this question is very easily answered. We know that this substance causes the regrowth of human insulin cells. These type one diabetics, are producing their own insulin, ON TOP OF their treatments, suffering from severe hypoglycemia. </p>

<ol>
<li>But why would the medicine be in a plant?</li>
</ol>

<p>Do you know what we have in common with plants? Have you ever heard the fact that we share 50% of our DNA with a banana? What we share, is the same building blocks of life. In that overlap, we constantly find plants producing neurotransmitters, that we have receptors for (the same way we discovered nicotine receptors, opiate.. THC.. CBD).  Over thousands of years, indigenous peoples were able to figure out which plants made someone get better. </p>

<ol>
<li>How about identical twins where only one expresses type one diabetes? (thank you, 911bodysnatchers322)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a non-issue to my proposed model. </p>

<p>The genetic model, which is currently used to diagnose and treat this condition, would state that neither twin really expresses the genetic trait, and the type one diabetes is caused by an external trauma to the pancreas. In which case, the twin may actually be a viable candidate for more advanced treatments that can even cure the &quot;fake&quot; diabetes. </p>

<p>Do you see the corruption in the current model? The current model assumes that if you are a type one diabetic, that it is genetic, and that no known treatment will work (yes, there are some advanced medicines and treatments aimed at reversing diabetes if you catch it early, but understand, these are only available to a select few, who are deemed to be viable candidates). And, more importantly, the model assumes that it is too late to help T1 diabetics who have had the disease for years. So, the current model, abandons the hope for any cure, for anyone who is already living with the disease (it is okay, there are some new cool expensive treatments coming out that will let you live a lot closer to normally!) and instead aims at fighting the disease as soon as we find it.</p>

<p>Yet, the beautifully simple model that I offer, without having to meet so many levels of outlandish complexity, tells you that there is a cure, that it will be cheap, and easily available, and that the only thing holding it back is the dogmatic (and convenient scientific view) that type one diabetes is genetic, and therefor a permanent undeniable brandishing of being an inferior human being, not fit to survive in nature. </p>

<p>Science has played on fear, and insecurity, to reserve knowledge and treatment for the elite that can afford the finder&#39;s free. It is time for medicine to become about healing, not profiting.  </p>

<p>To further reinforce my opinions... after sharing this information yesterday, this was &quot;coincidentally&quot; released. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36113773">http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36113773</a></p>

<p>The DAY a new theory is proposed, the BBC releases this information to suffocate the truth. I may not be as loud as the BBC, but I will not be bullied, and I believe people are smart enough to think for themselves if they are presented with the information. </p>

<p>Please, understand why this could be suppressed, and why you have never heard of this finding... </p>

<p>Diabetes is &quot;worth&quot; $400 billion USD a year globally. This cure will not happen without massive demand. There is too much money, in too many pockets, for this science to ever reach the people in the current state of research.</p>

<p>EDIT: It is important to add, that this framework does not suggest our current understanding of A to B interactions are incorrect. This theory explains that we are focusing our understanding on symptoms, rather than the cause.</p>

<p>Also, for those who seem to believe I am trying to take credit as the first person to claim type one diabetes may not be entirely genetic: reread this information because you&#39;re more interested in me, than the concepts. I am not making such a claim. </p>

<p>For visual learners, I have included a very simple graphic to show that it is possible to draw the wrong conclusion, by being withheld key pieces of evidence. Keep in mind, this shows the concept unfolding as a pure fact-seeking system, in reality, the person computing this evidence is also subject to bias which will obscure relevant data points. This also demonstrates that directing research based on theory, can lead to people exclusively seeking data points in the wrong location. This is why no cure can be found. </p>

<p>If you agree with this information, please share it. Information is power, and we need need to start arming ourselves against what is showing to be, a world of misinformation and manipulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting... I just finished the book &quot;Tripping over the Truth&quot;, which contends (with good evidence) that cancer is <strong>not</strong> caused by genetic defects.  Genetic sequencing of tumor cells found that the cells all had mutations - but they were different between cells in a tumor, and different between cells in multiple tumors. In the 1930s, Dr. Warburg proposed that cancer was caused by metabolic disfunction in the cells. Later research showed that mitochondria were malfunctioning - and the gene damage was happening after that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously a much longer story, and a fascinating read. But so frustrating, because as good scientists get closer to the truth, their funding gets chopped.  There is a huge amount of money available for research in the current, incorrect, paradigm - and the amount of money being made from poisonous chemo&quot;therapy&quot; drugs is insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, thank you for taking the time to read my post, as well as the time to respond to it.</p>

<p>It appears the dogmatic obession with genetics at the cure of all disorders, routinely causes us to overlook the most simple answer </p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor is a powerful tool, but, we are quick to apply it before we&#39;ve decided which data points are relevant, and which are noise.</p>

<p>I believe that through systematic manipulation, such research never moves forward, because if people accept such data points as &quot;fact&quot;, there is no way they can come to the conclusion that the current understanding is adequate. Science chooses to ignore the questions they cannot answer. This dogmatic approach, means we are missing valuable data points, that we need to form accurate conclusions. </p>

<p>For instance, including the points that I have suggested... diabetes cannot be a purely genetic disorder. I do believe this approach is just as valid for cancer. Further, I believe there are more points, which could be brought to light by exercising this framework.</p>

<p>Including &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; (as portrayed by academia and the media) as data  points, rather than dogmatically assuming they can shed us no light on the matter, can allow for answers that satisfy all aspects of reality. Those are the only answers we can accept. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another valid data point, and one that an unperverted media would embrace. Yet, rather than accepting the simplest answer, those within the sphere of influence would tell you that this is an exception. That, neither hold the genetic trait, and that the pancreas must have received some form of insult in one twin, but not the other. That, the symptoms experienced only mimic true genetic type one diabetes (that sure would be convenient!).  </p>

<p>And I should add, in which case, if you are wealthy enough, you might be able to receive treatment. Because, conveniently, some rich people happen to have different conditions which can be treatable. But, if you are a genetic diabetic (read as: not rich) you are not a viable candidate for these treatments, because your immune system will destroy the cells (they don&#39;t know that, they have never tested, but you&#39;re poor, and the &quot;genetic model&quot; means you can settle with the concept that it probably wouldn&#39;t work for you anyway). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be the case.</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<p>What if the public, outside of the influence of academia, were to meta analyze data sets?</p>

<p>For instance, a group of volunteers would take a disease, such as diabetes, cancer, etc. and collect as much information as possible, UNDER THE ASSUMPTION, that there has indeed been structural perversion in the sphere of research, and media. A re-learning committee. Investigating the field of research outside of the dogmas of institutionalized science. Like the philosophers of the old world, but with the information at the click of a mouse. </p>

<p>Could in this way, a small number of devoted volunteers possibly give new answers to the world. Answers, based on information, and purely that. In this way, rather than a select few people, with a grand deal of money, deciding what is fact and fiction... the public may decide for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, possibly another data point which would support the same conclusion. </p>

<p>How many data points will it take to convince the average person? Unfortunately, theory is NOT a data point, in fact, it is an attempt to explain data points.</p>

<p>Instead of people evaluating theories based on the amount of reality they can satisfy, we accept them as fact, and will discredit ideas without exploring their degree of truthfulness.</p>

<p>I argue, that this simple understanding, satisfies a larger degree of reality than the current &quot;theory&quot;. It tells us why plants can cure the disease, it tells us why the disease is increasing, it tells us why it cured the mice, and why we observe the effects we do, in recreational use, it explains successes in Gerson Therapy, and it explains anecdotal cases of type one diabetics not needing insulin while using such substances.</p>

<p>All of these questions, cannot be satisfied by the genetic answer.</p>

<p>Again, it will always be a case of separating signal from noise...  but to assume every point of data outside of a theory is noise, is frankly insulting to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a 40 year type two diabetic who refused to medicate. Blood sugar levels were normally between 250-350 for decades. Did many self-experiments and concluded that type two is at its root a food sensitivity to grains, all grains. Not sugar, not insulin, grains.</p>

<p>Not any sort of expert about type one diabetes, but I do note that it is common to the very young, but not exclusively so. My best educated guess is that it is caused by the medicines we give to people who get the flu/pneumonia with still developing immune systems. This is entirely based on a long series of interviews with the parents of type one diabetics. The ultimate medical study would be to find out why type one is so abundant in Scandinavia where there is universal free medical care and less common in other parts of the world. Is there even one remote place on earth with no medical doctors prescribing drugs? If so, how many folks are diabetic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your experiences as a type two diabetic. I have heard of such links. Perhaps, there seem to be numerous ideas that could explain the start of any non-genetic dysfunction. Still, the focus remains of assuming the disease is genetic, and focusing on the treatment of symptoms.</p>

<p>There are few areas of the world outside of the scope of modern medicine, and those that are, would not be able to answer that question. One could speculate based on inquiring into instances of childhood death among the population, but I am unaware of any researcher adopting this line of questioning among an indigenous population. Those who would be genetically type one diabetic in the understanding of the current model, would be dead shortly after developing symptoms (there is no other outcome).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you that I have contacted a researcher (who also educated me in neuroscience, and runs a lab utilizing mice to explore disease models). He has not responded to me (2 days and counting). If this changes, I will update this post. However, given that I received no response, and the BBC released their information coincidentally (maliciously, perhaps) I decided that dealing with the very institutions that perpetrated this illusion was a likely unprofitable investment of time, and effort.</p>

<p>The public deserves the information, I believe in it strongly, and as of the current events, am choosing to present it to those who have the power to enact change. </p>

<p>At all levels, the depict in the institution has gained a life of its own. Billions of dollars change hands, and the public must assume that the information will all be willfully, and fully disclosed. Unfortunately, human nature (read: ego) is to prioritize the self. We live in a society, where we have not been taught to truly differentiation right, from wrong, at the most fundamental level. There are researchers, and many involved in medicine, who believe it is not inherently immoral to profit off of human disease.</p>

<p>Are these people, the people one can trust to act morally? And to willfully share all information?</p>

<p>Yet, we fund millions into fake research that is chasing dead end cures, to keep the corruption funded. Then, pharmaceutical companies expect, after making HAND OVER MONEY, for people with the chronic diseases, to pay exorbitant fees for medical care.</p>

<p>Cures don&#39;t happen, because we don&#39;t let them happen. Money isn&#39;t made from them, and the public is too stupid (that is what they think. Is it true?) to figure it out for themselves. But now, in the age of the internet, one can easily acquire knowledge, and through careful evaluation, form conclusions from data sets that no one else may have considered.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My statement in no way contradicts the information you are presenting. </p>

<p>I agree, that the truth can be determined by scientific methodologies. I am not speaking collective consciousness, and you have been brainwashed to assume so.</p>

<p>My simple statement means that until the majority of a population knows the cure exists, it doesn&#39;t to them. Currently, the world has been told to believe this. What I am saying, is that due to the immense amount of money exchanging hands, and the will of the ego, information that would otherwise better humanity has been withheld, or false information has been presented (again, if you cannot acknowledge that there is indeed fake research, that we are not aware is faked, then you have no experience in academia). </p>

<p>To blindly place faith in science alone, is to place your entire conception of reality into the hands of an elite few. Anyone with an understanding of human dynamics or history, knows that a knowledge differential allows for control of power. That is how the very classroom you adore functions.</p>

<p>In short, the modern rationalist is akin to the devout religious zealot, except on the other end of the spectrum. Neither can acknowledge that, they have no means by which to differentiate fact from fiction. Because to the militant rationalist, all it takes for information to be added into your perception of reality, is for it to appeal to authority. And, you&#39;ll even attack me, because you don&#39;t understand I am separate from the information. </p>

<p>I understand my tone may be defensive, but I cannot allow invalid arguments to dispell truth, or influence people&#39;s opinions at this crucial time. Should you present information undeniably proving me wrong, I will willfully concede. But until then, I will continue to build information to support the case, because even a small chance of benefiting millions of lives completely outweighs my effort expended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe that I have information showing I am right, and that is by showing the alternative model aligns with otherwise &quot;unexplainable&quot; medical mysteries, or needlessly complex exceptions. </p>

<p>With the knowledge that the alternative concept aligns with what we understand (science) as well as what we don&#39;t understand (mysteries), it is by virtue of probability, more likely to be the true answer.</p>

<p>Think of it as a conceptual truthfulness index. The more points your framework can satisfy (with a simple answer) the higher probability of the theory being true. </p>

<p>The less of reality a theory explains, the less likely it is to be true. It is with this simple reasoning in mind, that I can (within the best of my knowledge) tell you that a non-genetic model answers far more aspects of reality (which I addressed in my post). </p>

<p>Reality is reality. If a theory cannot satisfy reality, it must be reevaluated. I have reevaluated the theory, by including relevant (but ignored) data points, to draw a conclusion that more accurately describes reality.</p>

<p>It appears the dogmatic obession with genetics at the cure of all disorders, routinely causes us to overlook the most simple answer </p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor is a powerful tool, but, we are quick to apply it before we&#39;ve decided which data points are relevant, and which are noise.</p>

<p>I believe that through systematic manipulation, such research never moves forward, because if people accept such data points as &quot;fact&quot;, there is no way they can come to the conclusion that the current understanding is adequate. Science chooses to ignore the questions they cannot answer. This dogmatic approach, means we are missing valuable data points, that we need to form accurate conclusions. </p>

<p>For instance, including the points that I have suggested... diabetes cannot be a purely genetic disorder. I do believe this approach is just as valid for cancer. Further, I believe there are more points, which could be brought to light by exercising this framework.</p>

<p>Including &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; (as portrayed by academia and the media) as data  points, rather than dogmatically assuming they can shed us no light on the matter, can allow for answers that satisfy all aspects of reality. Those are the only answers we can accept. </p>
