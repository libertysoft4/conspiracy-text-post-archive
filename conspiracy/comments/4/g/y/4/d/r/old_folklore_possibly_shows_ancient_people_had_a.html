        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not here to talk much about ancient people conspiracies as I am to ask questions about them, I want to know if you guys think this is suggestive or not.</p>

<p>The Inca had myths of large people who lived when the earth was &#39;only twilight&#39; (the sun did not shine brightly) and when the sun began shining as it does today they were forced to live underground to save themselves from the sun. apparently the Inca even said that living underground made the large people <em>smaller</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting, but I am interested in two things:
1) This almost perfectly explains what would happen to a race that had become even partly subterranean through evolution over a significant length of time, and
2) This is a great explanation of what happened to the earliest mammals during the great extinction. The sky (because of soot and smoke) was much dimmer. Animals of all kinds were dying in the masses, so it was the ones who took shelter in caves and by burrowing who eventually emerged and developed into the mammals we know today.</p>

<p>That could all be coincidental, but I notice these kinds of things in lots of myths, like the Sumerian stories of Niburu and the Anunaki. </p>

<p>These myths, depicting another planet or large planetary body crashing into earth, bringing a &#39;people&#39; who lived on said large planetary body into contact with the earth.</p>

<p>That almost sounds like an asteroid hitting earth which contained some sort of microbe that developed into the protoplasm from which life was sired on earth (which I think is a good theory).</p>

<p>Of course, Final Fantasy 7 also told stories of a meteor which brought biological plague upon the ancient people who inhabited the planet, and I&#39;m pretty sure they weren&#39;t referencing the Anunaki, so this could also be coincidence.</p>

<p>I guess the conspiracy here would be that earth has seen technological advance many times, only to be devastated in some cataclysmic way that destroys progress and leave survivors who can&#39;t continue the technological feats of their time, so the information is lost to time?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly.</p>

<p>a great example is the procession of the equinoxes. i mean even for us to have realized what was happening we are talking about 1000&#39;s of years of collected observations, but it also required an understanding of the world being round, its rough size, the size of the earths orbit, the moons orbit, the orbits of planets we could not even see until a few 100 years ago i may also add.</p>

<p>when you look at some of the knowledge that was possessed even 3000 b.c. we sort of start running in to walls where things haven&#39;t survived in any form but myths and legends and even from those days some of these some what impossible/uneplainable things were known.</p>

<p>so imho we are a whole fucking load older than our written history even scratches, or some crazy alien probe crashed or some one taught us, frankly both are possible but id like to think we did that ourselves and &quot;nuked&quot; our selves in the process and lost a lot of our collective memory in the wake of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, a lot of our alloys last longer than 50,000 yrs, never mind our nuclear waste would still be active and traceable, plus a few of our satellites would still be in orbit then. So evidence of our civilization would still be around. Future people, studying those traces, probably would not be able to get a lot of details right, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>But to this day, we still have not found traces of those super ancient super advanced civilizations. I&#39;m not saying that they could not possibly have existed, just that we do not really have any credible traces. There may have been some proto-civilizations we&#39;re not yet aware of, which push human &quot;domestication&quot; a little bit further back. But that is not as sexy or dramatic... ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence of <em>our</em> civilization. No one is saying there were hyper advanced nuclear wielding civilizations like ours, just that they could have been much more advanced than we portray them. </p>

<p>Philosophical and mental advancement is arguably more important than the &quot;build fast, cheap and break fast and easy&quot; technologies we have today. We are not <em>that</em> advanced. The truly most advanced tech on the earth today is extremely rare and only owned by the elite, which just goes to show how medieval and pathetic we are. This civilization is a husk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just a speculator, but I refuse to believe mainstream archaeological discoveries as what they are presented to be. Also, how do we know that the more advanced groups didn&#39;t just leave? If the elite were to board space ships today and take all of their new advanced tech with them, and then a global natural disaster struck, what would be left behind by them? Not much. Future people might find some alloys that lasted, and detect some isotopes, but other than stone foundations there wouldn&#39;t be anything. All they&#39;d be able to deduce would be that a civilization existed at some point. Sound familiar at all?</p>
