        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In this video I discuss a small portion of the reasons that I believe that we are not on a globe Earth.  I believe that fake space is one of the most telling clues that we have to the lie.  This hour long video is the first in a multi part series, and I will be creating the others soon.</p>

<p>These are a compilation of the videos that I have created in the past.  This video, along with 98% of my other videos are all live stream recordings.  This means that I research, manipulate images, and give my conclusions and thoughts live.  This comes with no editing, no scripts and no notes.  They are thoughts and topics that I understand and discuss &quot;off the cuff&quot;.  I believe that this method shows my genuine nature as well as my ability to discuss topics at random.  </p>

<p>The video can be viewed at: <a href="https://youtu.be/He-vwIZNaLo">https://youtu.be/He-vwIZNaLo</a></p>

<p>Thank You,  </p>

<p>By the way, this is an original channel of mine.  If you want to see the bulk of my research and theories, you can view the Flat Earth playlist (in order), to see my progress from July 2015 to present.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very similar to me suggesting that you personally need to go to space to support your globe fascination.... that&#39;s a ridiculous assertion, and proves a non-scientific mindset.... WHY?  The Earth&#39;s shape must be able to be verified by measurable things on this Earth.  We do not need to get obscure, and that is where I believe part of the deception lies.  See, you believe there&#39;s an end to the flat and want me to prove it...... it&#39;s like I believe there&#39;s no satellites, but why would I expect you to prove it?

2) time prohibitive
3) there must be other things to prove the shape other than being flat and an edge.<br/>
4) At no time do I suggest there is an edge, for this would be a suggesstion of which there is no proof.
5) with all of the space walks, why don&#39;t we have a single video of them doing a 180 degree turn?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 180 degree turn is an excellent point.  Also the lack of airlock footage.  I think that&#39;s a huge one.  </p>

<p>If astronauts on spacewalks really used an airlock to pressurize and depressurize, they would be spewing out footage of it constantly.  Space fanatics would eat that shit up.  </p>

<p>I mean think about how good that scene with Sandra Bullock was in the airlock. (whatever movie that was, Gravity or Interstellar.)  If it was real, there would be footage.  </p>
