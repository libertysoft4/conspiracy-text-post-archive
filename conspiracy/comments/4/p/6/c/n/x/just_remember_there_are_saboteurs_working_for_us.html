<p>There are legions of people working within the system that have been, and still are, actively sabotaging any globalist plans they can.</p>

<p>This is why you are seeing an acceleration of the open corruption and craziness in the last decade or so. The global elite <strong>are</strong> arrogant, but they&#39;re also smart. They know more and more people are waking up, especially trained individuals like military personnel. They are freaking out.</p>

<p>Nothing more to say except don&#39;t give up, or get discouraged. It&#39;s not just the &quot;outsiders&quot; fighting them, we have agents on the inside as well, and they have been delivering devastating blows to the globalists and feeding us knowledge to help the fight on our end as well.</p>

<p>Stay strong, brothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually mostly agree with this, but.....if their plans were have the whole thing under control by 2000, then why the long-term plans on 9/11? That clearly was set in place for decades. </p>

<p>I realize that they probably knew ahead of time that 2000 wasn&#39;t going to hit the target, not like they woke up 1/1/00 and were like &quot;Holy shit, we blew it,&quot; but even so.  </p>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure the target was really 2000, or maybe some years got lost along the way and 2000 is actually a year or so out. Maybe this is 1984.  </p>

<p>Either way, though, you&#39;re dead-on right about saboteurs riddling the system. Some of them, I think, don&#39;t even know they&#39;re saboteurs until the moment arrives -- twice in my life, I&#39;ve had opportunity to nail these bastards just fall right in my lap, nothing pre-planned or plotted, and then it was up to me to nail it. </p>

<p>So part of this, too, I think, is just some sort of strange supernatural synchronicity that puts good people in the right place at the right time to do the right thing.  </p>

<p>I have these thoughts also.  I decided long ago that I would not shrink from saying the truth, no matter what the consequences.  It&#39;s been proven in psychology, that many times it takes one person speaking out at the right moment to shake others around them out of their stupor.  We are coming to a moment in history when it will be important to make a conscience decision which side we fall on.  Love your comments, I always look for them.</p>

<p>I love this. Shrinking so that others around you feel comfortable does nothing to serve the world. Reminds me of one of my favorite quotes ever.</p>

<p>&quot;Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.&quot; - Marianne Williamson </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t tell the first story, it&#39;s too personal in the sense that there are quite a few people who know it and might connect it to me. Unlikely, but you never know. </p>

<p>The second was a long consulting job I&#39;d finished and the company I worked for never took me off one of their group email lists. Just general incompetence from people too arrogant to think they&#39;d ever make a mistake like that, so I didn&#39;t tell them. Figured I&#39;d learn some amusing gossip, maybe, along the way.</p>

<p>Ended up being bigger than that. I got mistakenly cc&#39;d on a forwarded email that originated from a huge public health corporation that was planning to go private, and one of the attached documents was the PR plan to fool the public into thinking this was a good thing for them, with all the pushback talking points and ways the conversation could be waylaid on minor tangents and moved away from the fact the corporate guys at the top were going to get very rich while the public was going to get fucked.</p>

<p>I printed it up a few times, put it in envelopes and anonymously mailed it to several of the newspapers and TV stations in town. The deal fell through, people had to resign. It was glorious. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf">[UN Declaration of Human Rights]</a></p>

<p>We don&#39;t have this in america.  Nothing close.  Here are some reasons why</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Article 3: Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.</strong>
<strong>Article 12</strong>  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home
or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has
the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. 
<strong>Article 13  1. Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the
borders of each State. 2. Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to
return to his country.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t feel safe with the NSA able to gain backdoor access to my devices.  As an IT professional who was charged with removing (iirc) nimda and mydoom viruses from nearly 1500 computers in 1999, I discovered child porn on a UGA staff member&#39;s computer.  I had to testify to the Dean that this person did not have the technical capability to put it there on a &#39;file share hidden by the windows OS&#39;.  This made me realize hacking is done so they <em>can store illegal materials on OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S COMPUTERS</em>.  This is why I do not trust the NSA and their &#39;unlimited powers&#39;.  Also, NSA people were caught with child porn and I find it both discusting and demoralizing and have never looked at child porn other than in my capacity as an IT employee.</p>

<p>Prominent conspiracy theorists, authors of books critical of the government have been harassed and detained at airports and &#39;had problems with their passports&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Article 4: Article 4 -- No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could argue that having no guaranteed income, or public housing to fallback on, or no universal healthcare, that we are all stuck in an abusive relationship with society, demanding that we work very long hours (more than 40-60 hrs if you work a low-paying job).  This creates a wageslavery situation.  One should be able to feel safe in a society of abundance to have a guaranteed income that is minimal and will let you survive and not be homeless but is very unattractive to most people, thereby incentivizing them to do work to improve their social status and level of comfort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Article 5</strong> Article 5 No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are being punished in America every day that mass surveillance and psychological operations happen on US soil to trick us into perpetual war and enriching the security state.  </p>

<p>We have also allowed waterboarding and torture in abu graib. US Soldiers made iraqi children perform fellatio on grown men and we raped men anally with sticks and vaginally raped iraqi prisoners.  This is all disclosed by WIKILEAKS cables.  You know, that rogue outlaw organization that has committed treason for revealing these things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Article 6 Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.</strong>
<strong>Article 9</strong>  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. 
<strong>Article 10 Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent
and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any
criminal charge against him.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bush suspended <em>habeas corpus</em> in iirc 2006 and the continuity of government plan being in effect since 9/11 has caused the CIA/NSA and military intelligence community in general able to kidnap people and put them in blackops detention centers without trial by declaring them enemy combatants, revoking their citizenry.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Article 18 : Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right
includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in
community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in
teaching, practice, worship and observance. </p>

<p>Article 29  1. Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full
development of his personality is possible. 2. In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This enables the legal usage of any substance (&#39;illegal drugs&#39;--psychedelics such as mushrooms and ayahuasca) for religious purposes of anyone who claims to use them in their religion.  Since we can prove that white europeans practiced plant-sacrament shamanism in mystery schools in greece, turkey, italy, israel, egypt, even germany and n europe and russia, we can demonstrate that in all our religious traditions substances were used to alter conscoiusness and we can reclaim this heritage under article 18 and declare the war on drugs to be over.</p>

<p>Article 29 says drugs should be allowed if their use doesn&#39;t interfere with others and/or they can be used in a community in which they are used to advance the individual (ie: psychedelics -- ayahuasca has always been a group activity of exploration and self improvement)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Article 25  1. Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and
well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing
and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security
in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or
other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. 2. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies a minimum standard of universal health care</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US is a colony. It is a slave state. It was designed from the beginning to produce for the UK. That is the reason that we are all treated as slaves. Our only purpose is to produce for the Royal family and its Jewish bankster friends.</p>

<p>The recent Supreme Court decision means that almost anything goes as far as whatever the police want to do. You can already see their entitled attitude in the way they steal stuff from people. We are going the way of the South American states like Brazil.</p>

<p>They can plant anything they want on your computer (maybe not yours but mine easily). Perhaps more important for you, they can physically break into your home and plant drugs or CP photos etc inside your home, to be &quot;discovered&quot; later in a SWAT team raid. Or, they can simply murder you if they like. &quot;Drug deal gone bad.&quot;</p>

<p>The whole idea that some guys get to own huge lands because their grandfather&#39;s grandfather stole it is just bs. They do not own the land any more than I do.</p>

<p>The government clearly only works for the people in it and is designed to steal money from the people. See the bail out of Wall St.</p>

<p>Yes, we are in state of emergency and it means that the government can legally do whatever it wants. We need to find some way to organize and fight back.</p>

<p>I dislike organized religions and drugs. I do not think that they help people in general. Beer is probably the worst gateway drug. That said, I do not think that the government should try to control either thing. But, at the same time, I do not want some guy telling me not eat pork because it is against his one and true religion. Similarly, guys who think that they are Christians and therefore have the right to rape their daughters are also fucked. I think that everyone should be free to use whatever drug they like. We need high quality standardized dose drugs to prevent overdoses.  But I do not think that you should be able to drive high on shrooms. We need autonomous cars!</p>

<p>We are a long long way away from human rights and we seem to be going backwards. WW3 will further destroy our rights if it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our enemies? </p>

<p>Lol you think that without order and government this society could function? Not the few within this culture to question all around them, but the countless billions that are your next door neighbor or the kid that rang up your groceries last time you went to the store?</p>

<p>No we need control to funtion. The reason we need it is that humanity can&#39;t accept liability for its actions. </p>

<p>An overwhelming number of Americans supported the efforts to kill bin laden. Then when it came time to show all the shit we did in order to get that done it was pointing the finger. </p>

<p>All bullshit aside with the theories just going on msm scenario. </p>

<p>Look at this shit in Orlando. All these new facts keep coming up. </p>

<p>People need someone to hate. Its what keeps us going for now. At least until first contact. Mass awareness of first contact that is. </p>
