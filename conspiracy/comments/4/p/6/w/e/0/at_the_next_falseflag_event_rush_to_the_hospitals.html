        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The next suspected false-flag mass casualty event the very first thing the community needs to do is immediately go to the Emergency area of the Hospital(s) closest to the alleged terrorist event. If there actually are large numbers of traumatic injuries then this should be glaringly obvious, and more importantly, glaringly obvious if there are none.</p>

<p>It will be important to document what location the person is at and precisely what day and time it is. So pics and video are absolutely essential. Interviews would be good. Remain calm and keep a low profile. If you are challenged say one of the alleged victims is possibly friend/family.</p>

<p>So say you go to the Emergency room, and there is no sign of mass casualties. First record this fact, time/date stamp critical. Then go ask a nurse at the desk if casualties from the reported event are due at the Hospital.</p>

<p>If there are numerous casualties, then it is important to verify whether they are legitimate or not. A high casualty number means there will be seriously wounded people who will be waiting behind the critically wounded. So check to see just how serious the wounds are. A .223 at close range will do nasty damage. There should also be plenty of evidence of real blood. All walking wounded is a sign of fraud. Be discreet. Don&#39;t directly address a &#39;wounded&#39; person but engage anyone with them.</p>

<p>The police can keep the public out of a designated crime scene, but not at the Hospital, especially a public Hospital. You have every right to be there, with a smartphone. And if worse comes to worse fake an injury.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just how many people do you think would show up at anyone emergency room to record the scene? 1-3 maybe? As stated use your head. Obviously stay out of the way. But remember folks. What we&#39;re looking for is the absence of casualties. Frankly if the shit is real, it will be obvious. We&#39;re looking for the obvious fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Emergency rooms are a serious place even without something like a mass shooting taking place. They could be understaffed and/or near capacity on a normal day, especially in heavily populated areas. If you don&#39;t have a medical emergency you shouldn&#39;t be there.</p>

<p>I know I will get downvoted for this but please understand that this is a purely informational post. </p>

<p>Hospital security checking in here. This is absolutely not true at least where I live (Alberta, Canada). Under the trespass to premises act the occupier (which also includes those authorized by the owner to control access) which in this case is Alberta Health Services can trespass anyone from their property for any reason (of course I would be fired if I trespassed someone for no reason of course) and if that person then fails to follow that trespass notice they are committing an offense. </p>

<p>During a mass casualty incident additional staff and security are called in and all doors are locked or have security personnel directly controlling access. Visitors are asked to leave unless they are direct family members. Trying to gain access to the site goes through three routes. The ambulance bay is changed to external and initial triage. All patients must come through here. No one else is allowed. Any visitors or staff will be turned back and anyone who refuses to leave would be given a trespass notice once we realize we cannot gain their cooperation and then arrested if they failed to follow the notice. Then the main entrance becomes a staff entrance and the only way to get through these doors is with valid employee identification as a government employee or certain volunteer id&#39;s. The final entrance is for direct family only. You will be required to show your ID (No one can force you as is your right but it is also AHS right to not let visitors in who will not meet there conditions) and to give the full name of the family member you are trying to see.</p>

<p>Anyone who is there that is not assisting or attempting to find a family member would be asked to leave and eventually trespassed.  If you are referring to your smart phone as a filming device there is a standing order that you cannot film on Alberta Health services property even during normal working hours. This is for general visitors privacy who may not want it known they are coming into the hospital. </p>

<p>So long story short if you show up during a mass casualty incident. You are not getting into the site and once there are enough security staff on site (they get called in Community peace officers and contracted security) they will likely be kicking people off of the external property as well. </p>

<p>Also. No smoking on property. </p>

<p>I literally work in the field. I have trespassed people from the hospital before. It has gone to court and, spoiler alert, we win every time. I literally explained the trespass to premises act in my post. Read it or look it up if you like. It&#39;s 10 minutes of googling and reading and available free on government websites. You can&#39;t just say &quot;that&#39;s not true&quot; and expect people to take it as a valid argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would make sense for them to secure a situation like that. But what happens if I have a legitimate injury, unrelated to a mass casualty incident, and go to that hospital for medical attention? Will I be turned away from entry? Or will I just be put in the queue behind the critically wounded?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll go to external triage and sent to yhe green or yellow zones. Emergency is essentially split into three departments. They take over day procedures and the outpatient clinic and non immediate life threatening patients are sent to one of those two departments (green for the least serious and yellow for things that may lead to more serious injuries if not treated). People who check themselves into ER are not turned away unless triage determines they have no reason to be there at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few people here are posting that by going to the hospital/ER room, just to find out info about a false flag, can cause complications and unncessary over head, and you will get in the way of a real patient emergency.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>But use your head and just stay out of the way, or stand out side and make a head count and document if you see any victims of the soandSo false flag.</p>

<p>People receiving help at a hospital is important. But guess what? FINDING OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT FALSE FLAGS IS ALSO IMPORTANT!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would have to observe and track that type of data over a long time period to make anything useful out of it, and the most valuable data would be the activity over days and weeks leading up to the event.  Unless you had inside knowledge of when and where an event will occur, or independently verified historical hospital data, the best you could do is to continue tracking that hospital at the same time and day (and surrounding days) over the next several years. </p>
