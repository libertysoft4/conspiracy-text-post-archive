        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Red meat causes cancer, everything in the oceans is Fukushima level irradiated, all crops are genetically modified, all the bees to pollinate them dead regardless. Water catches fire, the same lands are both flooded and drought stricken, and 1/5th of the world still does not have fresh water to drink. The world is ruled by a psychopathic cabal that fuck children and worship devils, and the evil soulless puppets who they would have you believe are in charge actually aspire to be more like their true masters. Our humanity is being systematically mind-raped away from us, making us so easy to turn against one another: from bad actors dressed like ninjas in front of green screens killing indiscriminately beamed into your loungeroom in the dinner hour, to hyper-nationalist rhetoric saturated throughout every level of media and popular culture, to locking children in rape-culture gulags ... because they thought they would be allowed to escape their last prisons and need to serve as a lesson to others. Terrorism cases are being tried in children&#39;s court, children have been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole already in Australia, the US has been doing it for generations. We are free-range slaves, and we are being lied to about everything – and I do mean everything. You are alive, here and now, not by happenstance, but by intention, with intention and through intention. The very nihilistic proposal that nothing has meaning is the lie that is now so necessary to keep you from using that intention that put you here and now. Use your intention: change this shit now. Call shenanigans on the bullshit now, we need to take what is left of this world back from the dead hands crumbling it to pieces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I have one thing to add. View the world or at least try to view it as I do. Whenever I watch/read/hear on the topic OP posted about, I look at it like I&#39;m watching a movie. When I leave the cinema I understand that real life is back in my face. When i finish watching the news the movie is over and I&#39;m back with my happy self. Outside the sun is up and doves are circling around. The young plants have grown few millimeters from yesterday, the clouds are in a different position from yesterday-but still there. This is real life I say to myself. THE MOVIE IS OVER GUYS-WE&#39;RE OUT - REALITY IS AROUND YOU-LIFE IS AROUND YOU!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would propose to start migrating massively into churches.</p>

<p>If mussies can plan terrorist attacks from mosques , i see no reason why we couldn&#39;t plan a coup from our churches.</p>

<p>Also it would scare the shit out of them , if they happen to see a huge influx of people going back into churches, or at least create some confusion ;)</p>
