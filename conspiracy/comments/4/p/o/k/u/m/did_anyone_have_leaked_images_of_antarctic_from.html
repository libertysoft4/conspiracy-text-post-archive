    <div class="md"><p>If the inner earth is hollow and the shell has a symmetric radial density gradient (most probably true,) wherever you are on the inside, there is <strong>no (net) gravitational force</strong>, stemming from the application of calculus.  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem#Inside_a_shell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem#Inside_a_shell</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m familiar with the shell theorem, but I guess I&#39;m asking if hollow earth supposes gravity to be present on the inside &quot;pushing outward&quot;, so to speak. I&#39;ve seen stories where there&#39;s supposed to be an inner sea, but that wouldn&#39;t work if there&#39;s no net gravity inside.</p>

<p>Is Concave Earth the one where Earth is like a dish and light bends in funny ways?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Now, honestly the theory of gravity is that each point of mass attracts each other point of mass.  If this isn&#39;t true, then the Shell Theorem is just math.  To my best knowledge, scientists have not proven gravity at the small scale (or any scale) due to being unable to truly rule out electromagnetic influence.  And on the large scale, we just make the theory of gravity work since we see things supposedly orbiting around and then assign it a mass so the math works out.</p>

<p>All interesting stuff to really understand.</p>

<p>As for Concave Earth, it&#39;s the most plausible out of all Copernican alternatives, based on my research and does hinge on a few things being true (one being bending light as you point out.)  I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;funny ways&quot; though.  The light is claimed to be simply traveling along splines when not travelling perpendicular from the central point of the sphere.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an illustration I made:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had only seen the theory in passing but just looked into it more right now. I love ideas like this because theoretically they&#39;re self consistent. Similar to historical explanations of the retrograde motion of the planets. Those theories do explain the motion just as well as our current theory.</p>

<p>I have a question. Do you know of any observations that might indicate the concave earth theory is superior to the convex model?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Flat Earth isn&#39;t a terrible place to start as I do believe they are not totally bonkers when they point out issues with convexity, but they still may be too attached to their theory.  </p>

<p>For instance, there is something to the horizon, and it&#39;s non-compliance to how it would appear on a convex surface.  </p>

<p>a) The distance to the horizon doesn&#39;t seem to always hold.  In some positions we can see much further than should be possible, even taking elevation difference into account.<br/>
b) The horizon always remains at eye level no matter how far up one goes</p>

<p>And given that all the footage we have of &#39;outer space&#39; is fraudulent, and there is good evidence of this being true, especially since Mars, Moon and ISS footage is most definitely faked (although I can&#39;t say with 100% certainty) :</p>

<p>c) the distances ascribed to stars and planets might just be simple math backed out from false interpretation of red shifts and luminosity.  In Concave Earth, stars, planets and the moon are much closer and much smaller, just as they are in Flat Earth.<br/>
d) Sonoluminescence:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8UZ1-AqNcg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8UZ1-AqNcg</a></p>

<p>e) Reversing of star rotation in different &#39;hemispheres&#39; is internally consistent within Concave Earth, just as it is in Convex Earth.  It is not in the theory of Flat Earth.  See Mostafa Abdelkader geometrical inversion thesis written in 1983 for more information.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a particular video of a GoPro attached to a rocket launch from, I believe Virginia, which is surprisingly in view of the moon at a certain altitude, when it should be over Australia.  The reason this is possible in Concave Earth is due to Bending Light.  If you examine the picture in my grandparent post, you should intuitively grasp that as one gains altitude, one&#39;s vision of the inner geometry expands exponentially. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve more if these pique your interest, just ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve got more info, I&#39;m game. I&#39;m happy to learn about it from someone who knows more about the subject. You seem to have your concepts in good order, too. i.e. you&#39;re not bonkers.</p>

<p>Can I address some points?</p>

<p>b) I&#39;ve never been that high up with the proper equipment to confirm or deny this point, but according to the concave theory, is the apparent horizon we observe also due to the bending of light?</p>

<p>c) I totally agree that the distance to stellar bodies is based on significant assumptions, yet people/scientists generally speak of it as established truth. </p>

<p>d) I&#39;ve read a decent amount on sonoluminescence. What does it have to do with this theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone coincidentally just posted a thread on this discussion (kind of rare.)  I don&#39;t agree with everything he says, but it&#39;s another good source for information for someone who wants to know more.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4q3rfu/flat_earth_is_a_zionist_psyop_to_discredit_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4q3rfu/flat_earth_is_a_zionist_psyop_to_discredit_the/</a></p>

<p>b) Well I do believe amateur footage of rockets is real.  There are many examples of rockets being launched up to ~100 km (plenty available on YouTube) which is a partition of some sorts that needs to be investigated further.  But yes, the apparent horizon would emerge based on the bending of light.  <strong>The &quot;setting&quot; sun doesn&#39;t go &quot;beneath&quot; the horizon; it&#39;s light failing to bend enough towards your line of sight, and colliding with the ground, or looping either close or far above your head, causing darkness</strong>  See the image I posted above which should clarify this more.  Simply do your best to imagine yourself on some point of the inner surface, with that central light source rotating.  </p>

<p>c) Indeed.  I value math and science, but people need to understand the model (map) is not the machine.  Some useful predictions does not mean that the model is true.  This is extremely applicable to Quantum Dynamics.  They really mean Quantum Statistics.</p>

<p>d) Interesting that you came across sonoluminescence before Concave Earth.  I only ran into because of my investigations surrounding Concave Earth.  Essentially, in the &#39;accepted&#39; astronomical theory stars can have a diameters of hundreds of thousands of kilometers or more (Our sun is estimated by them to be 1.4 million kilometers diameters or something)  In Concave Earth, this just couldn&#39;t be the case due to geometrical constraints.  The diameter of these lights must be much smaller while still producing bright, intense light.  The phenomenon of sonoluminescence is producible in the lab and shown to be a brightly intense light, manifested using sound waves, through a not-well understood mechanism (although there a few leading theories.)  Whatever it is, it has <em>uncanny</em> similarities to the stars we see in the sky, hence the colloquial name of that video &quot;Stars in a Jar&quot;.</p>

<p>So basically, there might be a rotating central sphere which is filled with many of these sonoluminscent points, indicating that they are being created through some sound generator, (perhaps engineered by whomever created this Cell?.)  </p>

<p>I have a pet theory for the reason we see millions, nay, billions(!) of these stars when we focus on some patch in the sky.  The sonoluminscent points may be reflecting back and forth between the inner surface of this sphere (Optical physics mandates some transmission, some reflection and some absorption) causing an infinite multiplication of dimmer and dimmer stars, apparently very far away from us.</p>

<p>Haha. Couldn&#39;t agree more. People have been confusing accuracy with insight.</p>

<p>There have been some scant articles about sonoliminescence I&#39;ve come across. Really interesting that it intersects with Concave Earth.</p>

<p>Right or wrong, this is the sort of thinking &quot;science&quot; needs to embrace. Nowadays, people are way to quick to call something ridiculous or a creative thinker a quack. Then again, maybe it&#39;s always been this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is true that due to centrifugal force, when you spin something, matter gets thrown to the edge of the axis of rotation. There was an experiment shown on YouTube where water droplets were injected with air bubbles, and when spun, the bubbles actually formed a sort of &quot;core&quot; in the spinning bubble. So I suppose it is conceivable that when the earth formed, the spinning created a hollow cavity to some extent. I&#39;m not convinced about the magical &quot;sun&quot; that&#39;s supposed to exist in the center. That part sounds like insanity. Unless gases somehow collected and formed another sun inside which... I don&#39;t know. If that was true my mind would be blown to bits.</p>

<p>As for the second part, just look at Google trends. Too sharp a rise to be natural. I started noticing the flat earth tards everywhere there was conspiracy discussion, starting sometime around last year. Blatant attempt to make conspiracy theorists look like lunatics.</p>

<p>Read and study about Admiral Byrd and all of his expeditions down there for like 20 some years with insane amounts of resources and money from the US government.</p>

<p>What strikes me as odd is the unilateral exodus from Antartica by all the countries that were down there after his last expedition. Immediately the Antarctic treaty is signed afterwards. You can&#39;t go down there, or even lobby to go down there if you&#39;re some super company who wants the resources.</p>

<p>Immediately following the exodus of Antarctica? Us and Russia begin firing nukes straight up into the air. Operation fish bowl for one.</p>

<p>They found some sort of barrier. They all raced home and started shooting straight up. </p>

<p>Fuck. They can&#39;t get through.</p>

<p>NASA is formed, the militarization of space. The controlling body. You can&#39;t go up there unless NASA is informed. </p>

<p>Because it is a world heritage site, there&#39;s a range of protocols and policies to protect the ecosystem. You see the lack of care that most corporates give to the environment in their own back yard, imagine what they would do far from prying eyes. The research stations down there take all their waste off the continent as a lot of things tend to be very well preserved, check out Capt Scott&#39;s Hut as an example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you people always lie about this shit? You can&#39;t even see the curve at 120,000 feet. Look up weather balloon footage that doesn&#39;t use a fish eye lense. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s flat or round because we don&#39;t have the defining proof, picture of our whole plane/planet.  I&#39;m talking a real genuine full picture that isn&#39;t composite images. That&#39;s why I remain skeptical of both models. However since there is zero curve at the height I stated, how do scientists and most of the population believe boats go over the curve? I swear this sub doesn&#39;t even understand the elite sometimes. They don&#39;t tell us the truth about anything so why would they let you know what the shape of our world is lol. The flat model has its problems but so does the globe so don&#39;t come attacking me like I&#39;m trying to push a certain model cause I&#39;m not. We should all be in this together :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The footage from that video is insufficient evidence to make ANY claim about the curvature. Why are you guys arguing over this?</p>

<p>All cameras are subject to some distortion due to the way they collect light; the same goes for our very eyes. Not even accounting for the fact that light bends due to refraction and other less explored phenomena, especially when flying high &amp; observing a scale as large as the &#39;horizon,&#39; in which light may traverse hundreds of miles through an atmosphere of varying thermodynamic / electromagnetic properties.  This introduces all sorts of different issues with experimentation.</p>

<p>We need a mechanical way to determine curvature such as a repeat of the Rectilineator experiment, or some other novel idea.</p>

<p>If one really cares about this, figure out how to run an experiment to mechanically (not using optics) determine the curvature of earth and please post your results. Gathering a like-minded, conspiracy oriented team of intelligent people will probably be a start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you seeing the end?  Or perspective vanishing to a point, (since our eyes can only discern up to some resolution of light on the screen of the retina)?  Have you tried looking through magnification?  Does the horizon still end at 12.2 miles?  </p>

<p>Or perhaps natural atmospheric condition (air, moisture, pollution) creates the effect of the horizon?</p>

<p>Not a flat earther, I rather entertain Concave Earth, but all these questions, I hope you agree, are quite reasonable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like I said the earth is the shape of a V, so the southern hemisphere looks out at an angle, while the northern is at the bottom of the V just looks up. The southern hemisphere changes because the edge is spinning and we see over the edge.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll quote things from this article. <a href="http://www.adn.com/science/article/sunniest-day-year-look-why-alaska-has-most-daylight/2015/06/20/">http://www.adn.com/science/article/sunniest-day-year-look-why-alaska-has-most-daylight/2015/06/20/</a></p>

<p>The sun is a spotlight that spins around the inside of the V or U shape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you add up all of the daylight throughout the course of the year, every place in Alaska receives more daylight than every place in the Lower 48.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alaska gets the most sunlight but it&#39;s at the edge because the sun moves upwards towards the top of the earth, while Alaska stays at the bottom. The edge of the light touches Alaska 24 hours a day when the sunlight moves down.</p>

<p>I have you beat with this</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/norway/longyearbyen">http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/norway/longyearbyen</a></p>

<p>Longyearbyen currently has 24 hour sunlight. That means the earth is in view of the sun the entire day, and night. Which would also mean the opposite location on the globe would be in total darkness.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/kergulen/port-aux-francais">http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/kergulen/port-aux-francais</a></p>

<p>Yet port aux francais which is as southern as I can go in an 11 hour difference, and is at the complete opposite end of the globe nearly see&#39;s 8 hours of sunlight.</p>

<p>Same with this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sun is a spotlight and shines upwards and downwards and spins around in a circle. The earth is like a top. Like the flat earth but there is a big weight on the north pole to create the shape. The equator is half way up on each side and the north pole is at the very bottom of the V at the base. At the top of the V who knows what&#39;s up there but I&#39;m assuming infinite land. Once we&#39;re done playing this whole government game we can probably just fly away onto more land and maybe there are more holes in the world creating other worlds people live in. It&#39;s hard to describe. Picture the globe earth, cut the circle at the top, curve the bottom and have a sun that spins around the middle. The sun is a spotlight. When it&#39;s setting it&#39;s just leaving our view. continuing it&#39;s journey around the grand circle. It&#39;s a concept so it may be different slightly, but that&#39;s the theory that holds up the most in my eyes. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ll see if I can find a picture of two that represents my idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. I like hearing both sides and then making a choice for what I think. I&#39;m not a scientist or explorer so I will never have first hand proof of any theory or fact other than what I&#39;m told/read.
Interested to know if the world is flat is it a disc? If so , surely those living on the edge would tell everyone else by now.
Having problems envisioning this v shape planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually to the contrary. I&#39;ll leave you my list of reasons why I leave it as a possibility. I am not entirely sold like I said in the first place.</p>

<p>-Air planes always fly up to curve the earth when if in the southern hemisphere they should fly down</p>

<p>-The sun rays seem to be coming from a very short distance away</p>

<p>-The globe theory has holes, like us being able to look across massive bodies of water. They say it&#39;s gravity curving the rays, maybe. But I call bullshit.</p>

<p>-All NASA pictures are CGI</p>

<p>-Fisheye lenses are used to make a &quot;curve&quot; to the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you people always lie about this shit? You can&#39;t even see the curve at 120,000 feet. Look up weather balloon footage that doesn&#39;t use a fish eye lense. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s flat or round because we don&#39;t have the defining proof, picture of our whole plane/planet.  I&#39;m talking a real genuine full picture that isn&#39;t composite images. That&#39;s why I remain skeptical of both models. However since there is zero curve at the height I stated, how do scientists and most of the population believe boats go over the curve? I swear this sub doesn&#39;t even understand the elite sometimes. They don&#39;t tell us the truth about anything so why would they let you know what the shape of our world is lol. The flat model has its problems but so does the globe so don&#39;t come attacking me like I&#39;m trying to push a certain model cause I&#39;m not. We should all be in this together :) </p>
