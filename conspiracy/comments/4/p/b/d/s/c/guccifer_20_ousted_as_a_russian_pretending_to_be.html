        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-06-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MangekyouSharinganKa.html">MangekyouSharinganKa</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday, MotherBoard <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dnc-hacker-guccifer-20-interview">interviewed</a> Guccifer 2.0. He claimed that he was Romanian and not Russian, just like the original Guccifer and that he &quot;hated&quot; Russia&#39;s foreign policy.</p>

<p>However, when the journalists asked him to communicate with them <em>in Romanian</em>, he stalled, saying he didn&#39;t want to waste his time. Eventually, he wrote a few sentences in Romanian that were riddled with mistakes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But when we asked him to explain to us how he hacked into the DNC in Romanian, <strong>he seemed to stall us</strong>, and said he didn’t want to “waste” his time doing that. The few short sentences he sent in Romanian <strong>were filled with mistakes</strong>, according to several Romanian native speakers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also. some of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 had Russian meatdata in them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit A in the case is <a href="https://guccifer2.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/2.doc">this document</a> created and later edited in the ubiquitous Microsoft Word format. Metadata left inside the file shows it was last edited by someone using the computer name <strong>&quot;<a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/metadata.jpg">Феликс Эдмундович</a>.&quot;</strong> That means <strong>the computer was configured to use the Russian language and that it was connected to a Russian-language keyboard.</strong> More intriguing still, &quot;Феликс Эдмундович&quot; is the colloquial name that translates to Felix Dzerzhinsky, the 20th Century Russian statesman who is best known for founding the Soviet secret police. </p>

<p>Exhibit B is <a href="https://guccifer2.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/1.doc">this opposition research document</a> on Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Exhibit B is also written in Word. Several of the Web links in it are broken and contain the error message &quot;Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.&quot; But in a PDF-formatted copy of the same document <a href="http://gawker.com/this-looks-like-the-dncs-hacked-trump-oppo-file-1782040426">published by Gawker</a> a few hours before Guccifer 2.0&#39;s post went live, t<strong>he error messages with roughly the same meaning appear in Russian.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/error-messages.png">http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/error-messages.png</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most likely explanation is that the Russian error messages are an artifact left behind when the leaker converted the Word document into a PDF. <strong>That kind of conversion would be expected if the leaker&#39;s PC was set up to use Russian.</strong></p>

<p>In response to Wednesday&#39;s leak, CrowdStrike raised the possibility that the leak was part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, when he was asked why some of the files he converted into PDF had <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/guccifer-leak-of-dnc-trump-research-has-a-russians-fingerprints-on-it/">Russian metadata</a> in them, he explained that away by saying he wanted to &quot;leave his watermark&quot; (?), whatever the heck that means:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hacker said he left Russian metadata in the leaked documents as his personal ”watermark.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a computer programmer myself, this makes <strong>absolutely no sense whatsoever</strong>. First, why choose Russian to leave his watermark? Secondly, and more importantly, the metadata that was in Russian actually consisted of <strong>errors</strong> because the hyperlinks could not be accessed when the Word files were converted to PDFs by him. Only an idiot would believe some errors in a PDFs metadata are some sort of &quot;watermark&quot; And shouldn&#39;t a watermark be something personal, like a logo or something? What&#39;s so personal about a bunch of hyperlink errors in Russian in a PDF file?</p>

<p>All this makes even MORE sense when considering an article on oilprice.com about the Russian government promising to release Clinton&#39;s emails:</p>

<p><a href="http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russia-Is-Reportedly-Set-To-Release-Intercepted-Messages-From-Clintons-Private.html">Russia Is Reportedly Set To Release Clinton&#39;s Intercepted Emails</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reports indicated that the decision as to whether to reveal the intercepts would be made by Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, and <strong>it was possible that the release would, if made, be through a third party, such as Wikileaks.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, WikiLeaks&#39; Assange said that they&#39;d be releasing more of Clinton&#39;s emails to help indict her:</p>

<p><a href="http://betanews.com/2016/06/12/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-emails/">Julian Assange&#39;s WikiLeaks poised to release more Hillary Clinton emails</a></p>

<p>Before you start championing Russia&#39;s government, just know that they&#39;re ding this to advance their <em>own</em> interests, not ours. This is all part of  the Russian government&#39;s disinformation war against the West. The Russian government is interfering with U.S. elections because it&#39;s afraid of Clinton&#39;s record as a war hawk. They prefer Trump, who has promised to disband Russia&#39;s main enemy, NATO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Moscow’s discreet messaging about a possible leak of the traffic,** in time to impact the U.S. elections<strong>, was designed to pressure faster U.S. legal action on the matter, **but was largely due to Russian concerns about possible U.S. strategic policy in the event of a Hillary Clinton presidency.</strong>]((<a href="http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russia-Is-Reportedly-Set-To-Release-Intercepted-Messages-From-Clintons-Private.html)">http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russia-Is-Reportedly-Set-To-Release-Intercepted-Messages-From-Clintons-Private.html)</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, WikiLeaks, Snowden, and now Guccifer 2.0 - all being controlled by Russia. Looks like the timing of this is no coincidence: <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/us-senate-pushes-for-new-committee-to-hunt-russian-spies/573161.html">http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/us-senate-pushes-for-new-committee-to-hunt-russian-spies/573161.html</a></p>

<p>They&#39;re objective is quite clear now.</p>

<p>Hatred? Exposing the propaganda and disinformation of these regimes is not &quot;hatred&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are also pushing propaganda related to Russian hacking activities directly after NATO decided that hacking is an act of war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, NATO said that it would be an act of war <em>only</em> if it was severe enough - like damaging a nuclear power plant or causing  huge amount of economic damage. Second, are you implying that I&#39;m a NATO shill just because I posted one or two links about Russian attacks? Do you want to <strong>ban</strong> all discussion of Russian/Chinese hacking attempts, where they call themselves members of ISIS but use the same attack vectors as Russian hackers have in the past? Isn&#39;t that sort of stuff the <em>exact</em> thing that should be exposed on this sub?</p>

<p>There are people who post non-stop about the U.S. in this sub. Why aren&#39;t you condemning them? I post a few links to articles about Russia&#39;s false flag ISIS attacks and you start attacking me like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Why? </p>

<p>What are <strong>your</strong> motives, <a href="/u/Balthanos">/u/Balthanos</a>?</p>

<p>Nice distraction tactic. I could say the same to you: your posting history is full of anti-American attacks.</p>

<p>Your goal has been partially achieved: attempting to attack the OP&#39;s posting history as a <strong>distraction</strong> from the topic at hand. Thus, from now on, I will ignore all posts from you, as I do not want to help you in your endeavour of distracting from information that puts Russia in an unfavourable light.</p>

<p>Realistically, even if you are interested in fighting enemies <del>foreign</del> and <strong>domestic</strong>, you can&#39;t simply ignore &quot;foreign&quot;.</p>

<p>The US has global military positioning and the geopolitical climate and stability therein is largely dependent on US <em>foreign</em> policy.</p>

<p>So while it&#39;s great to hold your leaders to task, the fact that Russian peoples cannot do the same, without risk of being silenced/killed, etc</p>

<p>Means that this issue needs to be addressed on all fronts. If the US was torn down from the inside out, without a plan to re-stabilize or succeed power to competent constitutionally respectful leaders, the county and world would be destabilized. </p>

<p>And don&#39;t think Russia isn&#39;t entirely aware of this reality. Which is why they are funding online propaganda campaigns aimed at making US people hate their government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.”</p>

<p>Russia wrote the book on many psychological warfare techniques, and if people are unaware or choose to ignore this they are being dangerously ignorant, helping Russia achieve it&#39;s goals which are not altruistic in nature.</p>

<p>Pacepa reveals that Kremlin’s “dezinformatsiya” goes back to 16th century Russia. In his opinion, the most successful disinformation attack had been launched against the Vatican and the Catholic Church, culminating into a “vicious war against Pope Pius XII and the Judeo-Christian world that broke out in 1945 and has never ended.”</p>

<p>Misinformation and disinformation are not interchangeable, he clarified. “Misinformation is an official government tool while disinformation is a secret intelligence tool.”</p>

<p>Lt. Gen. Pacepa, who defected from the Soviet bloc and was intimately knowledgeable of its security, explained that “During the Cold War, more people in the Soviet bloc worked for the disinformation machinery than for the Soviet army and defense industry put together.” (p. 38)</p>

<p>Considering Russians basically invented or at least have contributed or are directly responsible for the modern form and interpretation of Disinformation, including popularizing or giving modern meaning to the word: Yes, I&#39;d say they helped write the book on psychological warfare.</p>

<hr/>

<p>That being said, I think the CIA and other US government alphabet soups are equally formidable or excel in other types of warfare. That being said, some was in response to Russian disinfo campaigns, others were to cover up their own criminal programs or operations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand the difference between pissing off Russia and war. The U.S. is trying to use E. Europe to make a point to Russia. But doesn&#39;t contradict my earlier point, which was that <strong>there will never be a war between NATO and Russia.</strong></p>

<p>No matter what happens, the powers that be care about their survival over everything else. Nuclear war is something they won&#39;t risk. Sending weapons and a few hundred/thousand troops to E. Europe is just a big FUCK YOU to the Russians. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>

<p>Nobody can wage war on Russia with 4000 troops and likewise, Russia won&#39;t nuke the U.S. because of military exercises with Poland.</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s your belief but there&#39;s really nothing of substance to back up your statement there.</p>

<p>People said that WWII would have never happened after seeing the devastating effects of &quot;modern war&quot; at the beginning of the last century.</p>

<p>The only thing we can reliably say about history is that large wars are inevitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t answered the questions I asked.

<p>There are a million reasons why your example is wrong. One, the U.S. drone bombed a terrorist, so Pakistan can&#39;t claim it&#39;s an act of war.</p>

<p>Second, the U.S. pays Pakistan hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, along with making sure Pakistan buys its weapons.</p>

<p>Third, the U.S. did not bomb  and has already been bombing terrorists with Pakistan&#39;s permission. Only difference this time is that it didn&#39;t bother asking for permission. Not an act of war.</p>

<p>Considering these things, do you still think the U.S. is at war with Pakistan? </p>

<p>Not even close. Very, very poor choice of an example, <strong>especially in relation to Russia</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s called &quot;undeclared war&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia and Pakistan are different examples, and the Pakistani government has not said this was an act of war. Lastly, this is a war <em>against</em> terrorists. The war against the Taliban was declared over a decade ago.</p>

<p>Where did you get that malarky from? Entering another country with military vehicles and dropping bombs violates that country&#39;s sovereignty and is an act of war.</p>

<p>That&#39;s direct confrontation.</p>

<p>The only reason why the US can get away with it is because Pakistan knows they can&#39;t defend against us even with it&#39;s nuclear deterrent capability.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t give any country the right to violate the sovereignty of another.</p>

<p>The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war. The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the U.S. Air Force for strikes in Pakistan in order to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion. The United States was criticized by[according to whom?] a report on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty for abusing the term &#39;Global War on Terror&#39; to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war.</p>

<p>Hell, even Wikipedia is backing me up here. Crazy.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Don&#39;t minimize the amount of civilian casualties and amount of drone strikes over there. It hasn&#39;t been &quot;a few&quot; and there&#39;s been plenty of innocent lives lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>So far Russia has had no official response. But on Wednesday, an official at the Center for Information Security of the FSB, Russia&#39;s secret police, gave a warning to WikiLeaks that showed none of the tact of the U.S. reply to the Iraq revelations.</em> <strong><em>&quot;It&#39;s essential to remember that given the will and the relevant orders, [WikiLeaks] can be made inaccessible forever,&quot; the anonymous official told the independent Russian news website LifeNews.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Why did Wikileaks get cold feet?</em></strong></p>

<p>Wikileaks will never hesitate to embarrass a NATO country.</p>

<p><strong>What changed in 2010?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why in December 2010 did Medvedev suggest Assage et al be nominated for Nobel Prizes?</strong></p>

<p>Reddit had a thread on THAT too:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ej3ks/russia_calls_for_wikileaks_founder_julian_assange/">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ej3ks/russia_calls_for_wikileaks_founder_julian_assange/</a>?</p>

<p>Then...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Public and non-governmental organisations should think of how to help him,&quot; the source from inside president Dmitry Medvedev&#39;s office told Russian news agencies. Speaking in Brussels, where Medvedev was attending a Russia-EU summit yesterday , the source went on: &quot;Maybe, nominate him as a Nobel Prize laureate.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t that REALLY strange?</p>

<p><strong>Have you never wondered how/why Assange got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tomorrow">RT talkshow</a> in the beginning of 2012? After he threatened to expose Russian secret documents?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How did Assange have connections in Russia to house Snowden?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-told-snowden-to-stay-in-russia-2014-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-told-snowden-to-stay-in-russia-2014-5</a></p>

<p>This seems odd. </p>

<p><strong>Was Wikileaks started as a Russian OP?</strong> </p>

<p>I say no.</p>

<p><strong>Has it become one?</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think it is. </p>

<p><strong>Even the KSA leaks are looking a little more suspicious even recently.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsbred.com/shia-sunni-angle-india-and-wikileaks">https://www.newsbred.com/shia-sunni-angle-india-and-wikileaks</a></p>

<p>Saudi Arabia is aligned with Western interests. Iran is pro-Russia. Pay attention to the <strong><a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-16/saudi-arabia-s-oil-war-with-russia">Oil Price War</a></strong> going on now between Russia and KSA. See the pattern? In the realm of geopolitics, the Saudis are allied with the Western and its obvious Russia isn&#39;t toeing that line. </p>

<p><strong>Who leaked TPP? Who is TPP not including? Russia and China.</strong></p>

<p>Is the pattern not getting more obvious now?</p>

<p><strong>Who leaked the Sony pictures files?</strong></p>

<p>WIKILEAKS</p>

<p>There is a clear and consistent anti-western tint here that needs to be investigated formally. </p>

<p>Why the hell did WIKILEAKS post articles about how CIA spies travel?</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Agee">Phillip Agee</a> vibes from Assange/Wikileaks/Snowden  </p>

<p>Look at how Wikileaks DOXXED John Brennan&#39;s family: <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/21/wikileaks-doxxes-cia-chief-s-wife-and-daughters.html#pq=T9jQM0">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/21/wikileaks-doxxes-cia-chief-s-wife-and-daughters.html#pq=T9jQM0</a></p>

<p>So lets look to right now...Wikileaks and various Anonymous twitter accounts are showing infighting over Wikileaks consistent support for pro-western talking points. </p>

<p>Look here: </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks_forum/status/666337141962706949">https://twitter.com/wikileaks_forum/status/666337141962706949</a></p>

<p>Some anonymous accounts are chastising Wikileaks for this tweet:</p>

<p><strong><em>Anonymous has also started to retweet other comments suggesting that that wikileaks is itself toeing a distantly pro-kremlin line:</em></strong></p>

<p>The man who used to WORK at Wikileaks finds their orientation and identification with the Russians as suspicious!</p>

<p>Why would Snowden make this comment when he left the airport in Russia after he left the airport?</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/Statement-by-Edward-Snowden-to.html">https://wikileaks.org/Statement-by-Edward-Snowden-to.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Yet even in the face of this historically disproportionate aggression, countries around the world have offered support and asylum.</em> <strong><em>These nations, including Russia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Ecuador have my gratitude and respect for being the first to stand against human rights violations carried out by the powerful rather than the powerless.</em></strong> By refusing to compromise their principles in the face of intimidation, they have earned the respect of the world. It is my intention to travel to each of these countries to extend my personal thanks to their people and leaders.*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Russia? Venezuela? Bolivia? Nicaragua? Ecuador? </p>

<p>Bastions of freedom? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snowden-says-he-didnt-cover-his-tracks-in-hong-kong-2014-7">Snowden has a span of 11 days of which he can&#39;t account for when he was in Hong Kong, but at the Russian Embassy.</a></p>

<p>One of the FIRST revelations about the NSA documents he leaked didn&#39;t come from Greenwald/Poitras/et al, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/10/business/international/south-china-morning-post-history.html">from the South China Morning Sea.</a>. His whole campaign about preserving domestic intelligence integrity started off by revealing chinese espionage. </p>

<p>CIA Agents like Bob Baer (inspiration for movie Syriana) <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27616054">think Snowden got flipped when he was working in Geneva.</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>If they were honest about the fact that they are anti-west, we wouldn&#39;t have to dodge anymore about them pretending to be objective sources of information. They clearly doctor and filter whatever narrative they want to push. Its useful to understand that anyone who offers you information on a friend for family member immediately should become suspicious, even if that information is true, surprising, or revelatory. What does that person have to gain from sharing it with you?</p>

<p>No source is free from bias but what Wikileaks is choosing to OMIT is equally important IMO.</p>

<p>Because Russia is a nation with its own national interests and is not doing this out of the goodness of its heart. It is attempting to influence the U.S. election, so Trump will win. </p>

<p>Say you like Trump and he wins because of Russia, but 4/8 years later, the Russians don&#39;t like one POTUS candidate and start using active measures to elect the one that favours them the most. Then what? Is that OK to you? Not to me.</p>
