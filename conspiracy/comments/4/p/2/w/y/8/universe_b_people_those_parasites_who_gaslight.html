        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before you downvote because I&#39;m going to revisit the &quot;Nestle Mandela Effect&quot;, I have to tell you that I had a very enlightening conversation with someone today.  They mentioned chick-fil-a and jcpenny being additional &#39;distortions&#39;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a short but growing list of things that are &quot;misremembered&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Berenstein / <del>Berenstane</del> EDIT: Berenstain Bears</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEjDk71Tkrk">Chick-fil-A / Chic-fil-A</a></li>
<li>JcPenny / JcPenney</li>
<li>Mandela dead / Mendela Alive</li>
</ul>

<p>Now looking into these things, I found something VERY VERY INTERESTING.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/6OnYjtFubM/">https://www.instagram.com/p/6OnYjtFubM/</a></p>

<p>If this is real, then the implications are that there was a syndication across publications and possibly on television announcements of assumingly purposeful misspelling / mispronounciation of Berenstane Bears to Jewify them for some reason.  Possibly to introduce a cognitive, systematic, antisemitic bias into the minds of americans as a &#39;timebomb&#39; to cause a widespread &#39;confabulation&#39; at a later date when the &#39;actual&#39; spelling is revealed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a time when the culture has reached a maximum potential ultranationalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not possible that everyone in the 70s read TV guide alone and didn&#39;t notice the misspelling immediately.  They&#39;d have to have it in newspapers also and on the media for it to stick.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Anyone who would purposefully do this would be gaslighting the public for a specific reason.  That reason--the purpose of gaslighting generally--is to cause someone to feel unsafe, anxious, confused and unsure of what they know.  Ultimately to distrust themselves and their understanding of the world around them.  It&#39;s a hand dealt by a psychopath as a means to shutdown the targetted individual, and isolate them when that target tries to express their confusion.</p>

I will concede that &quot;JCPenney&quot; seems wrong to me, but allow me to play devil&#39;s advocate.

Perhaps that is the point, to discredit those that can see.</p>

<p><em>Moonraker:</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040815034045/http://universalexports.net/Movies/moonraker-cast.shtml">https://web.archive.org/web/20040815034045/http://universalexports.net/Movies/moonraker-cast.shtml</a></p>

<p>Search for &quot;Dolly&quot;. She is the minor character who becomes love interest to the antagonist&#39;s henchman, Jaws. Those who&#39;ve seen <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> and <em>Moonraker</em> will remember he&#39;s the big guy with metal teeth. And those who remember <em>Moonraker</em> will recognize Dolly as the girl who smiles back at Jaws with a mouth full of braces. Thus cementing their likeness and love. </p>

<p>Now her braces are gone. Even from VHS copies of the film. And the weird thing is that if you check Universal&#39;s site on the <em>Moonraker</em> cast, it shows Dolly with perfect teeth. Yet it lists her character description as a girl with braces. </p>

<p>That&#39;s fucking weird. </p>

<p>And I should say, I remember this film. Saw it in the theater in &#39;79. And a few times since. <em>The character had braces.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I feel. We&#39;ve been lied to. It&#39;s not that the universe and our reality is changed its that we were lied to then slipped the truths little by little in such a way that it wasn&#39;t obvious. 
We remember different spellings because they WERE different but we are told nothing has changed. This creates tension, anxiety and a further distrust of our SELVES. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad, really. The world is ruled by evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not self fulfilling.  There&#39;s a limit to the lemminghood of people and I wasn&#39;t convinced it was &#39;bearenstein&#39; because some cute 17 yr old with big boobs on youtube said it 2 decades later.  I&#39;ve had conversations about this while smoking pot in college and we said &#39;berenstein bears&#39; not the &#39;stain&#39;.</p>

<p>I immediately had a reaction to the revelation of &#39;berenstain&#39;.  It gave me a double take.  I mean it really threw me when i first found out about it, something like 2010-2011.  I didn&#39;t watch youtube to come to that conclusion.  I read one article and just about fell out of my chair.</p>

<p>First cold-read was &#39;if it were &#39;stain&#39; I&#39;d remember a bear dropping his puddin&#39; pop on hisself&#39;   -- but instead I think of a nice Jewish bear family.  That&#39;s coming from somewhere. And something like 8 or 9/10 people thought it was stein (&#39;steen&#39;) also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The closest thing in theory or common fiction to cause this phenomena would involve time-travel. However normally practically nobody would really know how history gets changed because normally it tends to be divergent. Yet all this stuff with stuff being remembered as different would be associated with convergent timelines. So what would be the reason to actively converge at least two different timelines where so many people have different memories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not self fulfilling.  There&#39;s a limit to the lemminghood of people and I wasn&#39;t convinced it was &#39;bearenstein&#39; because some cute 17 yr old with big boobs on youtube said it 2 decades later.  I&#39;ve had conversations about this while smoking pot in college and we said &#39;berenstein bears&#39; not the &#39;stain&#39;.</p>

<p>I immediately had a reaction to the revelation of &#39;berenstain&#39;.  It gave me a double take.  I mean it really threw me when i first found out about it, something like 2010-2011.  I didn&#39;t watch youtube to come to that conclusion.  I read one article and just about fell out of my chair.</p>

<p>First cold-read was &#39;if it were &#39;stain&#39; I&#39;d remember a bear dropping his puddin&#39; pop on hisself&#39;   -- but instead I think of a nice Jewish bear family.  That&#39;s coming from somewhere. And something like 8 or 9/10 people thought it was stein (&#39;steen&#39;) also.</p>
