        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently posted this to <a href="/r/Glitch_In_The_Matrix">/r/Glitch_In_The_Matrix</a>. You might find my account interesting.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve heard of this subreddit before, and to be perfectly candid, I&#39;d assumed you were all &quot;kooks&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;. Nonetheless, recent events have compelled me to reconsider this position. I&#39;m not sure about the world anymore. The more I read these stories and accounts, the more I feel that it&#39;s just the tip of an iceberg, that something of enormous significance is being systematically hidden from us. I&#39;ve followed slight inconsistencies and oddities in records and government accounts, and they&#39;ve led me down a rabbit hole that&#39;s led me to abandon everything I know -- or I think I know -- about the world. Something happened in December of 2004. Something huge. Something that&#39;s been somehow erased from our collective memory. As a theoretical physicist, I&#39;ve considered bizarre explanations of the phenomena I will describe -- alternate realities, quantum divergences -- but a full understanding eludes me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Postdoc in cosmology and theoretical physics at a major American research university. One of my colleagues -- who&#39;s studying for a PhD in astrophysics at the same University -- brought to my attention a curious phenomenon several months ago. His thesis focuses on the possibility of an orbiting exoplanet about 54 Piscium, a binary star system located 35 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Pisces. In the course of performing this research, he&#39;s exhaustively studied both online star catologues and archives -- which track the proper motion of the stars in this system -- as well as physical records and telescope images of the system. While he was searching for a volume on astrophysics in the University Library, he found an unusual folder of files left in one of the books, marked &quot;astronomical measurements on 54 Piscium -- 1997 to 2004&quot;, a remarkable coincidence considering the topic of his thesis. He examined the contents of the folder carefully, finding photographs and astronomical measurements of the motion and position of 54 Piscium, in addition to several other nearby binary star systems. Unfortunately, the measurements in the file ended on December 27, 2004, but this still offered invaluable information for his thesis.</p>

<p>To confirm the accuracy of the contents of the folder, he compared them against the online PPM Star Catalogue, which provides archived data of the motions of stars. Strangely, he noticed a slight discrepancy -- less than one-thousandth of an arcminute -- between the positions measured in the physical files and those from PPM. Stranger still, he found an even larger -- roughly 25% -- inconsistency between the speed of 54 Piscium B in the archived file and that from PPM. He compared both sets of measurements to other stellar archives -- including SIMBAD -- finding a similar discrepancy between the documents he discovered and the &quot;official&quot; archives.</p>

<p>He brought this oddity to the attention of his thesis advisor, and they carefully examined the data from both sources. Strangely enough, after accounting for the relevant variables, they found that the stellar proper motions and positions photographed and archived in the file were exactly those from the &quot;official&quot; account, but a full 24 hours earlier. It was as if an entire 24 hour period had elapsed, and was &quot;erased&quot; from the official records, which were edited to make them look internally consistent. He submitted these files and a brief explanation to higher University staff, inquiring as to their origin, but they never performed an investigation. Both my friend and his thesis advisor received threatening phone calls from anonymous sources, commanding them to discontinue their research on the matter. My friend claims he&#39;s seen black vans following him since the incident, but despite this, he&#39;d continued his research, examining old libraries and archives around the country, going to telescopes and looking for stellar photographs and measurements before December 2004. Surprisingly, these old records are hard to come by, but occasionally he&#39;s found the misplaced or forgotten record, and each one shows the same &quot;24 hour&quot; anomaly. 
In March of 2012, his thesis advisor left me a frantic and paranoid voicemail, claiming that &quot;they&#39;re on to me&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t be surprised when they get me.&quot; The following day, he was found dead in his home, three bullets to the head. It was ruled a suicide.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve continued my colleague&#39;s studies, searching for the few astronomical records dating before December 2004. The more I continue this research, the more it seems that such records have been destroyed and erased by the authorities. I&#39;ve collected what scraps of astronomical observations and eyewitness accounts I could, finding increasingly clear discrepancies with official archives of stellar positions. It&#39;s become almost certain to me now that the government records have been deliberately edited after the fact -- adjusted -- so as to erase a 24-hour period from December 27 - 28, 2004. To make the motions and positions of astronomical bodies seem consistent and continuous, they needed to &quot;push back&quot; the data by 24 hours, so that a stellar position originally recorded as being at 12:00 AM on December 28, 2004, for example, would now be archived as being at 12:00 AM the previous day; otherwise, there would be an obvious &quot;jump&quot; in stellar positions.</p>

<p>A &quot;missing day&quot;? Certainly a bizarre prospect, but one that seems ever more plausible given the few actual remaining astronomical records before December 28, 2004. An entire day on Earth, systematically scrubbed from the records as if it never happened. Our memories erased. What happened on that missing day? </p>

<p>Astronomical measurements are just the tip of the iceberg. I&#39;ve carefully examined government archives, reports of aircraft schedules, and bills of lading (reporting sea shipments), and the same inconsistency has repeated itself again and again. The official reports of plane flights the week of December 28 are particularly a mess. I&#39;ve poured through old archives, reams and reams of carbon paper, examining plane ticket receipts and flight schedules, comparing them against airline and FAA archives. The official archives have very obviously been fudged after the fact to remove evidence of a missing day. Official records of flight schedules often deviate from old archives by ten hours or more. As with the astronomical data, it seems that most original records -- except in the most obscure places -- have been systematically destroyed. Nonetheless, no matter how hard I look, I cannot find a single record from the missing 24 hour period.</p>

<p>Bills of lading, archives of trucking shipments, military reports in Iraq all show similar discrepancies and signs of fudging and manipulation. Nonetheless, it is in people&#39;s memories that the most obvious inconsistencies are found. It seems that most of our memories have been systematically erased, but a few have &quot;slipped through the cracks&quot;, as it were. I&#39;ve questioned people who seem to remember history differently from the official accounts. A similar subreddit, indeed, was built from one such phenomenon; namely, that many remember Nelson Mandela to have died in prison in the 1980s (<a href="/r/mandelaeffect">/r/mandelaeffect</a>). Similar accounts have also come to light, curious discrepancies that suggest official accounts have been manipulated. It seems many of these &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; phenomena culminate -- or otherwise resolve themselves -- in late 2004 or early 2005. An earlier poster himself commented on this fact, expressing the sentiment that something significant must have happened around that time (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/4l9qsx/the_2005_incident_theory/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/4l9qsx/the_2005_incident_theory/</a>). </p>

<p>On December 27, 2004, an unprecedentedly high-energy gamma-ray burst struck Earth from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. In my pursuits of theoretical physics, I&#39;ve discovered increasingly mounting evidence that high-energy particle collisions can &quot;trigger&quot; the creation of alternate realities, or alternate timelines. In the standard many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, each quantum event corresponds to different possibilities, each of which is realized in a separate parallel reality. I&#39;ve worked on modifying this model with superstring theory, which unites general relativity and quantum mechanics. Under this modification, the landscape of the quantum multiverse becomes much more active and dynamic. Particles can &quot;shift&quot; between timelines and universes under the right conditions. When particularly high-energy events occur, a shift of the surrounding space-time into an alternate universe might be triggered. The more I research this particular topic, the more it seems that it&#39;s being actively suppressed by the physics community.</p>

<p>I did see one record from the &quot;missing day&quot;, a photograph from a military archive. It shows a horrific sight of human bodies melting almost like fluid, on the streets of what appears to be New York City. A thin orange haze is vaguely visible above the street, and the buildings in the distance seem vaguely twisted in a non-Euclidean way. Although it was firmly imprinted on my brain, I&#39;ve never seen this image again. </p>

<p>Perhaps most disturbingly, I&#39;ve consistently found that old population records show roughly 300 million more people in 2004 than is accounted for by official archives.</p>

<p>I&#39;m being followed. My communications are being tracked. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be around much longer. I&#39;m posting this from a throwaway account. Hopefully the &quot;powers that be&quot; won&#39;t censor it immediately. If you want to pursue this, above all be careful. Leave no traces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few things. This does feel like an attempt to write a science fiction story, but I try to remain open minded about strange accounts such as this. Even if they are fiction, they can be useful for what they reveal about the motivations and thinking processes of people that seek to create hoaxes, and they provide information about how people react to exposure to strange information.</p>

<p>On another front, the description of the photograph of what happened to NYC is oddly reminiscent of &quot;The Amazing Criswell&quot;&#39;s prediction of what would happen in Denver Colorado in 1989.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.criswellpredicts.com/criswell-predicted.htm">The Destruction Of Denver, Colorado (p. 29)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I predict that this catastrophe will take place during the tourist season and the fun-loving people in the amusement zone will suddenly find their day of pleasure turned into one of horror. A roller coaster will rise and sway, throwing cars and occupants to the ground below. A Ferris wheel will collapse and carry many children to untimely deaths. A penny arcade will become a dungeon of doom, a canopy of a merry-go-round will plunge down upon its most innocent riders. I predict only silence will reign where there was once laughter and gaiety. The citizenry of this Colorado city will find themselves enveloped in a jelly-like substance that was once brick, concrete, steel and lumber. They will be unable to escape for it will be impossible to cut through or tear this substance. Although soft and pliable it will still retain the strength and weight formerly possessed. I predict in the outskirts the conditions will not be as serious but fleeing people will find themselves mired in roadways and hardly able to move.</p>

<p>I predict that scientists from all over the world will be called upon to help but no one will be able to offer relief for they will not be able to conquer this terrible force, this mysterious force from outer space. Gradually, as conditions ease survivors will be evacuated but this will become a dead city and will never again be reborn. I predict this unfortunate community will be a victim of elements beyond our control and will always be remembered until the end of time. I predict the name of the city will be Denver, Colorado. The date: June 9, 1989. </p>

<p>Additionally this story seems to also borrow from stories about The Philadelphia Experiment, specifically people being fused into the deck of the ship in some fashion. I will assume that most of you will be familiar enough with the story that I don&#39;t need to find a reference for it.</p>

<p>I do have to say though, that the timing of this post is slightly suspicious to me, considering the fact that it comes mere hours before I have posted my own speculation regarding the potential danger to the human race of Gamma Ray Bursts in my own sub, here: <a href="https://redd.it/4p3gz4">But seriously, folks...</a>, especially considering the overlap in subject areas between this post and my own post history, taken as a whole. Alternate realities, Gamma Ray Bursts, The Mandela Effect. If I was anyone other than myself, and aware of my posting history and this post, I would be suspicious that this post was made by a sockpuppet account under my control.</p>

<p>It gets even stranger though, as the trigger event for me to create that sub and start posting was a comic book, DC Rebirth, in which the major plot point is that the DC Universe is missing a decade.</p>

<p>Now, my doubts aside, I do find this story intriguing, and if you are in fact telling the truth (or your truth), and you decide to go into more detail, I would be interested to hear what you have to say, so please consider adding my sub. <a href="/r/TheTranslucentSociety">/r/TheTranslucentSociety</a> to your list of cross-postings.</p>

<p>And, with that being said, if this post is a &quot;shot across the bow&quot; or a warning of some kind for me to stop posting about the results of my research, or some sort of attempt to &quot;poison the well&quot;, better luck next time.</p>

<p>Either way, this was interesting, so thank you for that, and have a good day.</p>
