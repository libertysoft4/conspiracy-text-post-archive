        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>&quot;Ultimate Honeypot&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Clinton broke the law.  Given the many political donations from foreign nationals, it would appear more and more every day that she created her private email server in order to sell state secrets to foreign nationals.</p>

<p>She created a honeypot with secrets intended to be hacked.  We know this because Hillary lived in the white house and everyone from her staff to secret service were <em>very well aware that Hillary had a very strict understanding of security protocols and privacy</em>.  In fact, Hillary was widely considered <em>very paranoid</em>, enhancing security protocols and having routine bugsweeps in the white house.  She felt her conversations (and angered verbally abusive catfights) with Bill were <em>too sensitive and revealing</em>, and therefore she demanded the Secret Service personnel leave their post outside the bedroom doors and stay in a room down the hall.  </p>

<p><strong>Kommunication Kontrol</strong> </p>

<p>It&#39;s just a fact that Hillary was always very mindful of carefully controlling communication and demanded the utmost of privacy and control.</p>

<p>So the idea that she was innocent in having her own server is TOTAL BULLSH_T.  And we can PROVE IT.  Through statements made on video, by quotes from her advisors and staff, from former secret service people.  There&#39;s mountains of evidence that can prove this, for example, in court.</p>

<p>So the fact that the FBI, under the Dept of Justice is inhibited, misdirected, delayed and obstructed means that there is a standing directive to keep this from happening.</p>

<p>We know Obama is one source of that.  But we could just as easily say that it&#39;s the CIA.  Perhaps this is a CYA maneuver to avoid getting in trouble, seeing as how they must have allowed her to do it. &quot;And we would have gotten away with it if it weren&#39;t for you meddling kids!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Howcome no Jail?</strong></p>

<p>Once the public knew, that is, once Julian Assange of Wikileaks leaked the private server and emails, we&#39;ve had to struggle to come to terms as to why Hillary is not in jail right now.  It&#39;s created a deep demoralization and distrust of the government and the rule of law.</p>

<p>But more importantly, it&#39;s going to lead people to an inevitable conclusion when they realize &quot;the law of the land&quot; has been violated and is apparently suspended.  They will be puzzled as to why this is happening.</p>

<p><strong>Deeper Public Inquiry</strong></p>

<p>They will discover a few things if they think about it some.</p>

<ul>
<li>On 9/11 the pentagon was attacked but so was WTC which contained cia,nsa, fbi offices; meaning an attack on the government itself</li>
<li>Since 911 was an attack on the government, it started the Continuity of Government plan, which he renewed years later.</li>
<li>Obama renewed it twice, extending the &#39;state of emergency&#39; since 9/11 into 2016 and beyond.<br/></li>
<li>Obama SCRuBBED the wikipedia continuity of government article to hide his name, and the fact he renewed it twice.</li>
<li>COG governance means the &quot;CIA gets what it wants&quot; (--Obama) and the rule of law no longer applies to them; specifically the constitution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>America is no more</strong></p>

<p>If America is legally defined by the Constitution as the &#39;Supreme Law of the Land&#39;, then COG governance makes America no longer a lawful country, because the CIA is able to act outside of the constitution and rule america &#39;from the shadows&#39;.  I&#39;m using the CIA as a catchall for &#39;intelligence community&#39; including but not limited to CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, NRO, DIA, DARPA, etc</p>

<p>No laws, constitutional or otherwise, inhibit the CIA from assassinations, secret wars, voting manipulation, declaring martial law, killing americans in false flag events, suspension of the elections and keeping Obama in a third term.    No laws are applicable to the CIA.  </p>

<p>CIA can do whatever it wants and no laws apply to it.  </p>

<p>This is explains</p>

<ul>
<li>Why illegal wiretapping and mass surveillance happens and they are not punished</li>
<li>Why PRISM and so many other nefarious domestic spying, propaganda, and subversion by the military intelligence are happening now, unpunished</li>
<li>Why were were able to legally torture and detain people without allowing them legal trial</li>
<li>Why we were able to declare people to be &#39;enemy combatants&#39;, removing their citizenry</li>
<li>Why we were able to create ISIS</li>
<li>Why we were able to maintain perpetual war and fund it, despite the protestations of people on both sides of the political continuum</li>
<li>Why we deal with bots and shills and forum spies on a daily basis</li>
<li>Why this post will be artificially downvoted to 67% or 33% upvoted or end up with no more than 33 post karma</li>
<li>Why congress is not allowed to talk about COG</li>
<li>Why mainstream media refuses to talk about COG</li>
<li>If Alex Jones talked about COG, then maybe you should question the assertion that he&#39;s a gatekeeper (he did, many times)</li>
</ul>

<p>COG governance explains it all.  Tell everyone you know.</p>

<p><strong>All Part of the Plan</strong></p>

<p>Its beyond the scope of this essay, but it turns out, the real motivation for 9/11 was to cause the COG plan to go into effect by the bush administration, coordinated for decades by bush sr.  As a crowdsourced detective investigation, 911 has been proven over and over as an inside job thanks to the internet and many truth movements, but COG inhibits further action and the local police forces know this.  Their orders are to STFU and take it.  Just like us.</p>

<p>So instead of talking about 9/11, it&#39;s much more important to talk about COG.  You&#39;ll see active resistance against it as it will become VERY apparent that COG is the big 9/11 secret they don&#39;t want you to know.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you understand 9/11.  Sorry there are no sources but by all means fact check them and if you like this post, let me know you want sources and I&#39;d be quite honored to produce them for you very quickly as they are all just a google search away.</p>

<p>Message -- Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks</p>

<p>TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</p>

<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared in Proclamation 7463 with respect to the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, is to continue in effect for an additional year.</p>

<p>The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14, 2001, of a national emergency continues. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September 14, 2015, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat.</p>

<p>BARACK OBAMA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember that the Clintons are insiders in the &quot;national security&quot; establishment.  This all started FAR before 9/11.</p>

<p>This group of people effectively staged a coup when they murdered JFK in 63 under the leadership of Allen Dulles... all for &quot;national security&quot;.  </p>

<p>Dulles then passed the baton onto Dick Helms and later George HW Bush (who became director in the 1970s).  They staged the Watergate incident to get rid of Nixon when he tried to go his own way and used fake media assets to break the story.  <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/710466456941686784">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/710466456941686784</a>  Hillary was a lawyer planted in the watergate investigation.  </p>

<p>The Bushes were running drugs through Mena Mountain Airport together with the Clintons in the 80s during Iran Contra... in the name of &quot;national security&quot;.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsdNMI-130">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsdNMI-130</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s been the same revolving group of insiders that have been running the government against the will of the people for the past 50+ years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The coup happened long before JFK.  The Dulles brothers are just the princes of the financiers of the robber barons who were in power at the time.  Their relatives (Uncle in particular) were also incredibly influential during their era, using money to support the Nazi&#39;s and more.  Research Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and Brown Brothers and Harriman.  These two companies, just blocks from each other in NYC handled the fortunes/investments/lawyers of the gas, oil, rail, electric company robber barons.  Their history of taking over American democracy goes back to the 1800&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nor most private school texts. Print, being a huge medium for exchange of ideas, had to be gamed and controlled. IMO, it&#39;s why a printing press to this day still costs around 1 million dollars (newspaper presses about 10-20 times as much) new. You can get a decent digital printer capable of small runs at high speed for around 20k to 40k. The internet will go this way, with the websites serving as the printing press. The websites you congregate on will be owned largely by corporations with little interest in disseminating truth and every incentive to lie to you and sell you products and carefully crafted opinion. </p>

<p>Agreed. They are cut from the same cloth.  Freemasonry.  Which has an antinationalist agenda while looking ultranationalist.  The enabling factor is secrecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama was likely CIA.  I&#39;m not going to cite sources in this post, but you can go find them for yourself.  Obama was likely recruited when he was at Occidental college.  It is known that they were recruiting during the time period he was there. </p>

<p>Then you have his post-college affairs, which included a stint at Business International Corporation.  This company was known to provide media training and was a CIA front.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/us/politics/30obama.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/us/politics/30obama.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dan Armstrong, who worked with Mr. Obama at Business International Corporation in New York in 1984 and has deconstructed Mr. Obama’s account of the job on his blog, analyzethis.net, wrote: “All of Barack’s embellishment serves a larger narrative purpose: to retell the story of the Christ’s temptation. The young, idealistic, would-be community organizer gets a nice suit, joins a consulting house, starts hanging out with investment bankers, and barely escapes moving into the big mansion with the white folks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you have the whole issue of people not really being able to account for what he was actually doing at Columbia and then as a professor at U of Chicago.  He didn&#39;t really publish anything and that&#39;s just not something you do as a professor.</p>

<p>Then you can look at his book &quot;Dreams of My Father&quot;.  That would be known in the intelligence business as &quot;creating the Legend&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimes a person with a well-prepared synthetic identity (cover background), called a legend in tradecraft, may attempt to infiltrate a target organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A spy&#39;s claimed background or biography, usually supported by documents and memorized details</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then look at what he did in Chicago.  He took over and subverted community groups and directed their energy.  Michelle Obama even had a no-show job at a local hospital that was so important that they didn&#39;t even bother to replace her when she became first lady.  I don&#39;t know about you, but I would think that if she was actually doing something useful, then they would have to fill that position.</p>

<p>He is national security through and through.  That&#39;s why you see absolutely zero change and a doubling down, in fact, of the warmongering and &quot;security state&quot; policies that have been developing for the past 50 years.</p>

<p>You should also take the time to read Mark Gorton&#39;s (Wall Street quant and creator of limewire) analysis of Obama... I found out that he also believes Obama is CIA after I developed my own ideas about him.  </p>

<p>I may not be 100% accurate on some minor details, but there is enough evidence that points in the direction of him being CIA that your eyebrows should be raised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the problem is they don&#39;t believe in hell. They believe they have proof there is no hell and there even is no punishment after death (no karma).  Once you understand this, then you understand the <em>true value of law</em> and why the law must be itself protected from subversion. </p>

<p>This is something the founding fathers knew well because they themselves were Deists which means Dee-ists which means John Dee ists which means alchemists/rosicrucians/masons who had the &#39;secret knowledge of reincarnation&#39;...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrQIqKUvdqg">Thomas Sheridan spilled the freemasons ideological beans on this just yesterday</a></p>

<p>..that atlantean knowledge of &#39;no hell&#39; / &#39;reincarnation is real&#39; --whether true or not--was a guiding principle to form the checks and balances of the republic that was supposed to guard from this type of tyranny.  Yes the founders were gnostics but apparently the good kind (whitehats).  Not the ones we have pulling strings now (blackhats).</p>

<p>But like grass in a parking lot, if people are off to lunch (congress) they let incremental cracks in the asphalt happen, and then even the smallest seed of fascism falling in that crack will eventually destroy the entire lot over time.  </p>

<p>Well operation paperclip was like jackhammering a corner and dumping in grass seed.  </p>

<p>So this is where we are now.</p>

<p>Really?  I&#39;m going to have to get a console just for that game.  I had so much fun with vice city.</p>

<p>btw--I&#39;ve spent <em>countless</em> hours trying to figure out if AJ was a gatekeeper or not.  I&#39;ve still not decided.  The arguments for are incredibly weak and wrought with problems. </p>

<p>Also, the thing about gatekeepers is <em>not to discount the entirety of their work but to be able to identify the &#39;trojan horses&#39; of rhetoric they put into their work</em>, and then go back and fact check everything they&#39;ve said while ceasing to listen to any of their new stuff, especially after the point at which they introduced the trojan horse (ie: they were &#39;compromised&#39;--possibly their life or their family was threatened)</p>

<p>No, the opposite of nothing.  If COG were discontinued, then immediately (as in within the hour) the Dept of Justice working with law firms like Daniel Sheenan&#39;s Christic institute would sue individuals in the CIA.  They would also induce the US Marshalls Service (under DOJ)  to take these offenders into custody in to a detention facility for lengthy inquests under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act">RICO</a> -- the racketeering act.  Local police would deputize people at an amazingly fast rate, people like software engineers, IT security experts and PIs to work together to bring these people the fuck down, firstly by seizing their info and banking.  </p>

<p>Holy hell would rain down on them like fire.  They&#39;d have to transport these criminals in special bulletproof popemobiles because there would be raining of bullets from oathkeeper types under a limited form of &#39;marshall law&#39; wherein local police have deputized them and tried them locally for treason.  In other words, people would legally be allowed to take shots at these criminals until such time as congress passed a law that expressly forbid local deputization and state-rights to localized marshall law</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, <a href="/u/911bodysnatchers322">/u/911bodysnatchers322</a>, but I&#39;m still convinced Alex Jones is still a gatekeeper, and I will stand by that, simply because of the level of funding he must get in order to run his fancy studio and everything else. </p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly hard to believe such a large presence in the world of conspiracies would be allowed to succeed so well at what they are doing. </p>

<p>He also seems like someone tasked with painting conspiracy theorists as crazy maniacs.</p>

<p>The only explanation is that the global conspiracy simply doesn&#39;t end at some higher-authorized folks in the CIA, and that they are simply temporary managers of our country. These people might not even care if American society as we know it today falls down, because they can convince the revolt that they&#39;ve already won.</p>

<p>They simply would break down our society, and leave the higher-authorized people on the sinking ship. This would be so that any dissidents would think the war was already won. It&#39;s a quite simple plan that would explain lots of things.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, however. This is all still good information. Thanks for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your test for thinking he&#39;s a gatekeeper is a pretty solid one.  This &#39;follow the money&#39; approach.  I&#39;ve never bought a prepper filter from AJ or his expensive vitamins. Or anyone else who has. So how&#39;s he make money?  Making money doing media is harder than it looks.  This is why I&#39;m suspicious of ALL alternative media, including yes even James Corbett and his buddy Sibel Edmonds.  </p>

<p>But I consider that if these people are put out there to &#39;gatekeep&#39; and manage the dialog, they&#39;re playing a dangerous game.  They are hedging their bets on people &quot;just accepting what&#39;s given&quot; instead of going further.  But look what you just did.  You went further.  you looked into it.  You see, the problem with conspiracy people is it really is hard to &#39;manage them&#39;.  Because half of them actually are quite crazy (believing in things with no evidence whatsoever--and are therefore of different levels of nonfalsifiably).  The other half are so distrusting that they even fight among themselves....all the time. (raises hand: guilty!)</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the key, to find common ground and try to trust each other and to some extent even partially trust (by fact-checking and critical thinking/reasoning/observing) these alleged gatekeepers.   Like (iirc) Reagan said, &#39;trust.  but verify&#39;.  </p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, these gatekeepers may be doing far more harm to their own masters&#39; causes than they are to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading your post, I completely agree. I always thought that gatekeepers could still help us, if only to get people who would otherwise be mainstream drones to think something different for once, resulting in their masters ultimately losing out.</p>

<p>In my experience, if you are coming from a completely mainstream mindset, anti-mainstream information becomes so alluring to seek out in your spare time that it becomes a habit. This goes for and against us, as they can use this to continue to label us as obsessive, crazy &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, but we are much less likely to accept even the alternate media, because we are always seeking more information.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually quite true what you said, about us being half actually quite crazy and the other half being extremely distrusting. (I&#39;m guilty of this as well)</p>

<p>What do we get out of all of this? Again, like you said, we need to moderate these two halves, because it&#39;s important to partially trust ourselves, and sometimes it&#39;s necessary to partially trust gatekeepers. </p>

<p>Otherwise, we are either too divisive (why div&amp;conq tactics still work against us) or too trusting (why gatekeeping sometimes works).</p>

<p>TL;DR, I agree completely with what you said.</p>
