        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the number 1 question that nothing but flat earth can explain.</p>

<p>If the planet is rotating at 1000MPH, how come there is no evidence of it influencing anything off the ground?</p>

<p>If you take a plane from Africa to the Philippines that arrives in 5 hours, why the fuck does it also take 5 hours to go from the Philippines to Africa? </p>

<p>I asked my friend majoring in astrophysics and he took a while to Google this cause it shocked him so much and he at first tried explaining that the plane going with the rotation would be going 1300mph while the other one would be going 700 mph. Which is absolutely bullshit lmao. The one going against the rotation would be going -700 mph. But he could not explain why all flights around the world take the same time going back and forth.</p>

<p>Another excuse he googled was that the atmosphere moves along with the earth&#39;s rotation and that still doesn&#39;t explain why planes all take the same time back and forth. I also call bullshit on that atmosphere theory since there&#39;s no evidence of it moving anything. </p>

<p>Hot air balloons and weather balloons actually do not move far from their point of release depending on the wind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a physicist, but I&#39;ll use an analogy that I think will work.</p>

<p>Ever ride on a school bus?  If the bus is moving at 60 MPH and you jump absolutely straight up, does the bus move under you?  Would you land in the same spot you jumped from, or would you end up losing your place, and moving backward relative to the bus?</p>

<p>You would stay in the same place.  The bus is moving at 60 MPH, and so are YOU.  You&#39;re moving WITH the bus.  Same goes for planes, and same goes for planes flying around the planet Earth.</p>

<p>BTW, planes do NOT take the same amount of time at the same speed to go from East to West as they do from West to East.  Your entire assumption is wrong from the onset.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a teeny bit of information as to why:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream#Aviation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream#Aviation</a></p>

<p>The Earth is round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really hard to explain something to someone who doesn&#39;t even have a rudimentary grasp of basic physics.  But good for you for trying.  You may also want to try <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1sjlu3/how_much_does_centrifugal_force_generated_by_the/">centrifugal force</a> versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth">force of gravity</a> but that might be too advanced.</p>

<p>EDIT : btw the bus explanation is great.  Using that concept in the plane scenario where the plane is travelling against rotation of the earth---that means that when the plane took off from the ground it was already travelling 1000mph backward relative to space</p>

<p>The plane has to first overcome the first 1000mph backwards rotation in the relative context to be working with the rotation of the earth.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m wasting my life explaining this</p>

Like you can jump on an airplane and not get smacked by the back of the plane as soon as your legs leave the ground.  Why?  Because objects in motion tend to stay in motion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha wtf. Take a liquid and let it float in space. What shape does it take? Any liquid. You pick. Molten nickel. Water. Piss. Pepsi Max. Let it float in space. What shape does it take? </p>

<p>Throw a million different combinations of liquid and let it go in the zero gravity of space. What shape does it take? </p>

<p>A sphere. </p>

<p>Now we also learned that the bigger the mass the bigger the gravity. So even solids and gasses would get pulled together to form.... you guessed it  spheres. </p>

<p>At what fucking point would it ever float around flat? </p>

<p>Or is all that footage of astronauts playing with liquid fakes?</p>

<p>Now borrow a telescope from a friend. A decent $49.99 walmart  telescope will do. Find Mars. Or Venus. Or the moon. Fuck, look directly in the sun with it  what shape are they?</p>

<p>A circle. Now imagine them in a 3D space. What&#39;s a circle in 3D?... yea buddy, you&#39;re right. A sphere. </p>

<p>Or are the other planets and moon and sun photoshopped into the sky by the government?</p>

<p>No. So if surrounding planets and moons and stars and suns are spheres floating in space.... why would the Earth be? Are we special? No. </p>

<p>The earth isn&#39;t flat. Stop being stupid. </p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Use your brain for a second and you&#39;ll see how fucking stupid flat earthers are. </p>

<p>The ISS is far too big and sturdy to be launched into space as it. It would break apart due to the stresses involved with rocket launches. It was launched piece by piece and assembled in orbit. There&#39;s probably some videos/images of the actual launches that lifted pieces of the ISS kicking about somewhere, but for reference just look at any rocket launch. Please see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHkY3FusJIQ">this video</a> to understand how the pieces were put together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about when you can see the ISS through a telescope? Do they just string it up from the dome?</p>

<p>The dude in that video comes up with some fucking stupid bullshit about Chris Hadfield crossing his legs and says it&#39;s because he his abs are too weak to support himself upright in a harness? Jesus christ give me a fucking break, that&#39;s just some bullshit he made up to try and convince himself it&#39;s fake.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a bit where he says that the video must be filmed on a zero-g plane because the astronauts are grabbing handles to stabilise themselves like you do in zero-g on a plane. Well no fucking shit, it&#39;s probably pretty annoying when you&#39;re trying to talk to the camera and you&#39;re just spinning around randomly, of course you&#39;d fucking grab something to keep yourself more or less still. The mental gymnastics are fucking real, see in Rio!</p>

<p>There&#39;s a bit where he talks about detaching exercise machines so they don&#39;t make the station shake, but they&#39;ll happily push off walls and things, that actually makes perfect sense. A person floating into or pushing off a wall at a low speed doesn&#39;t really make much of an impulse. The problem comes from repetitive movements like running a treadmill or moving weights up in down, this oscillation is transferred to the station. Imagine you&#39;re in a rowboat, if you lean over to one side, the boat might move a bit but it&#39;s not going to go crazy. Now, if you rock side to side repeatedly the boat will also start to rock more and more. Same sort of thing.</p>

<p>He&#39;s talking about some santa model floating around, and the girl catches it and he&#39;s like &quot;Oh she looks a bit embarrassed like she messed up&quot;, when here face literally doesn&#39;t fucking change. He&#39;s also talking about how the astronauts seem overly happy in videos, well of course they would be, people don&#39;t make videos for public consumption where they&#39;re just moping around and looking glum, because people would just be put off.</p>

<p>Finally, he talks about how water and air are recycled on the space station, as if it&#39;s somehow impossible to filter or distill out waste from water (hint: we do it all the fucking time with sewage) or remove carbon dioxides and recycle the oxygen back. He says it couldn&#39;t be done because it&#39;s clearly impossible to restock the ISS with replacement parts. It&#39;s not like you could ever possibly put those things on a rocket and launch them up along with food and water, right?</p>

<p>Seriously, I&#39;m fucking done here. Eric Dubay is a fucking moron, he&#39;ll say whatever he can possibly think of just to try to bend his mind around his premade conceptions that the Earth is flat and so on, when even with the slightest working knowledge you can see that all he says is utter fucking bullshit. </p>

At first you feel it accelerate. You feel yourself kind of pushed harder against the floor. Then it reaches &quot;cruising&quot; speed and all that is left is actual earth gravity.</p>

<p>Now, if you deny that earth is a sphere, it means you deny the force of attraction that would make it a sphere, and therefore you deny the force of gravity.</p>

<p>If earth was at cruising speed through the universe, there would be no gravity. It needs to accelerate. Just like the elevator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just explained it. It&#39;s the principle of the elevator. The only way you can create the effect of gravity is via acceleration. In a fast car, when you accelerate, you feel yourself pinned to the seat. The car &quot;creates&quot; &quot;gravity&quot; towards the seat. But if it stops accelerating, even if it&#39;s going 500mph, you won&#39;t feel the force pinning you to the seat again.</p>

<p>HAhaha so you&#39;re cool with a dude that just says &quot;THIS IS SO BECAUSE I SAY SO&quot;, you trust his OPINION while completely ignoring the glaring video evidence that the video is 20+ minutes at zero G. That dude even has a problem with people smiling, lol for fuck&#39;s sake. He disparages that lady all the while failing to address the OBVIOUSLY floating object that is not and cannot be tethered.</p>

<p><em>Sigh</em>* It&#39;s obvious you&#39;re a &quot;true believer&quot; and nothing will convince you, you&#39;re literally laughing in the face of overwhelming evidence man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is the ISS the only one that can be seen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s larger. You know how this works right, you can see a building from far away but not a person. Besides other satellites can be seen as spots of light AFAIK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do they need harnesses?</p>

<p>What?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did they get past the Thermosphere? Why doesn&#39;t the ISS melt from the 2500f temperature of the Thermosphere? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.metabunk.org/how-to-satellites-survive-the-temperature-of-the-thermosphere.t6930/">Why didn&#39;t you google it?</a>
Could it be you&#39;re not REALLY interested in finding out?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went on to show you those lunar landings were fake</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You absolutely did not, what the hell are you delusional? Is making a statement equivalent to &quot;showing&quot; in your world-view? Link the specific point in the video where you see the strings.</p>

<p>Van Allen belts, chortle. Tell me is it the same misrepresentation where NASA is talking about how to solve the issue in their new craft and you just go and assume they&#39;ve no idea how to do it in general?</p>

<p>And here&#39;s the kicker. You&#39;d have to debunk <strong>each and every ISS video</strong> of which there are tons because even if ONE can&#39;t be debunked, well, there are people orbiting the planet in zero G. Sorry. Here&#39;s an easy one. Explain to me how they can appear to be in zero G for over 20 minutes. I bet you&#39;ll change the subject.</p>

<p>So, all in all, you&#39;re fooling no-one by playing the &quot;newly enlightened&quot;, I bet you&#39;re somebody&#39;s sockpuppet and all you&#39;re achieving is having people laugh at you and frustrating a few individuals like myself as to how people can be this ignorant in this day and age. </p>

<p>*How is it hotter at the equator when we are at a 23.4 degree tilt?</p>

<p>*How is it winter time when we are closest to the sun by 3 million miles?</p>

<p>*How would a mechanical gyroscope work on a sphere, where there are different ups and downs depending on where you are?</p>

<p>*How are satellites and the ISS not being affected by the millions of tons of micro meteorites that hit the earth each year, no accidents no satellites being hit, nothing?</p>

<p>*Why do we have Winter in the south and Summer in the north and vice versa when the sun is supposedly 93 million miles away and the heat travels those same miles should be hitting us evenly and by that same token the tilt should be causing more direct heat on the poles but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I&#39;m gonna bite, even though I don&#39;t expect anyone in this thread to change their opinion based on evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is it hotter at the equator when we are at a 23.4 degree tilt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it is not. It just has the same temperature all year round, due to being at a neutral point in regards to the angle of the ground to the sun.</p>

<p>The hottest places on earth, are found <em>exactly</em> 23.27° (accurate inclination of the earth) north and south of the equator. Wikipedia provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics#/media/File:World_map_indicating_tropics_and_subtropics.png">handy image</a> where you can see the hottest places line up nicely.</p>

<p>Of course, there not <em>every</em> point at the tropic of cancer/capricorn is the hottest relative to his neighbours, but that is to various other factors, such as ocean currents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is it winter time when we are closest to the sun by 3 million miles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the influence of the distance to the sun is negligible relatively to the influence of the angle of the sun.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate this to you:</p>

<p>At it&#39;s closest point, the earth is ~0.98 AU (for reference, 1 AU = ~1.5 * 10<sup>8</sup> km = ~93 million miles) from the sun away and it&#39;s farthest it&#39;s ~1.02 AU away.</p>

<p>The difference in power received from the sun (according to the inverse square law) is (1.02<sup>2</sup> - 0.98<sup>2)</sup> / 0.98<sup>2</sup> = ~8%, meaning we receive about 8% more power from the sun when we are closer.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s say you are at 30° northern latitude.</p>

<p>The angle to the sun is then in summer 30° - 23.27° = 6.73°, which then translates to receiving ~99% of the power per area we would receive at 0° angle to the sun (or, more accurate) 0° angle between the normal of the ground and the direction to the sun).</p>

<p>In winter the angle to the sun is then 30° + 23.27° = 53.27°, which then likewise translates to receiving ~60% of the power per area.</p>

<p>The difference in angle makes a whopping 65% more energy received per area in summer compared to winter.</p>

<p>Q.E.D.: The difference in distance to the sun is negligible compared to the difference in angle.</p>

<p>(Also, how does the Flat Earth Model account for the seasons in the southern hemisphere being exactly opposite that of the northern?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is the Arctic midnight sun (Sun is seen for up to 3 days straight) possible on a spinning globe, by that same account how is the north star always visible when we are always rotating and also spinning around the sun?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine a sphere on which top you are sitting, and imagine it rotating. You can see the whole horizon all the time, right? Right. If you don&#39;t think you can, I urge you to find a big sphere and look around you.</p>

<p>Now tilt that sphere a bit. The horizon from which you tilted away vanishes behind the horizon of the sphere (if it is big enough or you tilt far enough). The horizon you tilted <em>towards</em> however you can still see.</p>

<p>Put the sun there. You can still see it. It&#39;s very basic three dimensional geometry, shouldn&#39;t be that hard.</p>

<p>Now sit on the equator of the rotating sphere, and imagine the rotation axis being an actual physical axis that extends to infinity. As long as you stay on the upper half of the sphere, you will always be able to see part of the upper axis. The north star is kinda similar, as it is approximately infinitely far away and very close to the axis of rotation. You also cannot see it on the southern hemisphere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How come the curvature of the earth cannot be detected by the 8 inches per square mile proposed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it can?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where you are getting this from. You can literally watch ships slowly (seemingly) move down when they travel over the horizon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do planes not adjust to the curvature of the earth while flying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do. Every wondered why the paths of planes are curved on maps? That&#39;s because they follow the shortest distance between to points on a sphere (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">great circle-distance</a>), which when we project it on our two dimensional maps looks curved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would a mechanical gyroscope work on a sphere, where there are different ups and downs depending on where you are?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A gyroscope has nothing to do with up and down. It is simply a tool to measure rotation.</p>

<p>A mechanical gyroscope usually does this by having a rotating object, which will hold it&#39;s rotation axis independently from outside rotation.</p>

<p>And yes, we can observe the rotation of the earth with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are satellites and the ISS not being affected by the millions of tons of micro meteorites that hit the earth each year, no accidents no satellites being hit, nothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accidents happen, you just don&#39;t hear of them.</p>

<p>Also, they happen very rarely, since space is unimaginably empty. Seriously. The average human mind can simply not comprehend the emptiness of space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do we have Winter in the south and Summer in the north and vice versa when the sun is supposedly 93 million miles away and the heat travels those same miles should be hitting us evenly and by that same token the tilt should be causing more direct heat on the poles but it doesn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of this has already been answered in the point above, so I&#39;ll only shortly explain why the poles are cold. It&#39;s very simply explained with the principles I already laid out further up: The poles are always at least 90° - 23.27° = 66.73° inclined, and thus <em>at most</em> receive ~40% of the energy per area from the sun (relative to 0° sun inclination, yada yada).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon mission and ball earth image from the moon missions has been proven as fake in the documentary &quot;A funny thing happened on the way to the Moon&quot; why wouldn&#39;t they lie about other things?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Proven fake&quot;</p>

<p>No, that simply is not true.</p>

<p>Also, you always mention &quot;them&quot; lying, but who says those &quot;documentaries&quot; can&#39;t do the same?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Satellites should be seen all the time in front of the moon as sometimes planes are seen, yet not one time has anyone seen any satellite passing the moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also simply not true. There have been observations of satellites (in any situation where they could be seen). However, the average satellite is <em>much, much</em> smaller than the moon, and thus usually not perceivable by the naked eye.</p>

<p>You can however regularly see bigger objects (even with the naked eye, if I&#39;m not mistaken here) such as the ISS in the night sky. With the naked eye you will only see a not very bright dot drift by, but with good telescopes you can make actual images.</p>

<p>If you have a good telescope, you can make photos of satellites (though even with very good equipment still blurry), as [some italians](<a href="http://www.forumastronautico.it/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=3931.0;attach=59692">www.forumastronautico.it/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=3931.0;attach=59692</a>) (pdf) have done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree.</p>

<p>While I have sadly never seen a ship disappearing behind the horizon myself (I live quite far from the sea and can&#39;t really visit the sea or a suitably large body of water on a whim), I have seen dozens of image which show that exact phenomenon (though, most of them are very blurry due atmospheric distortions and/or shitty cameras).</p>

<p>There might be some effect of ships lingering longer than they should in view, due to atmospheric refraction, but eventually the ship will disappear.</p>

<p>One thing which shows the effect of the earths curvature rather nicely is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Erdkr%C3%BCmmung_Bodensee_IMGP3042.jpg">this image</a>.</p>

<p>The relevant text here &quot;CASA REHA Seniorenheim Ludwigshafen, 21 km entfernt, 3 Stockwerke vom Wasser verdeckt&quot; translates roughly to &quot;CASA REHA senior pensions Ludwigshafen, 21 km distanced, 3 floors obscured by water&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is a image of said <a href="https://www.google.de/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;amp;pb=!1s0x479a6738a0df0b3f:0x20aedc0147bc5664!2m5!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i100!3m1!7e115!4shttps://picasaweb.google.com/lh/sredir?uname%3D118398270379851971194%26id%3D6111938025204390578%26target%3DPHOTO!5scasa+reha+seniorenheim+ludwigshafen+-+Google+Search&amp;amp;imagekey=!1e3!2s-u7tL423_FWA/VNH3QGGCmrI/AAAAAAAAAAU/utrqCTq5EmkaudfSnvPEt_VxCk3-uZ5kQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwin_t20rcnNAhVJShQKHfWdCyoQoioIiAEwCg">pensions</a>, though it is a bit low resolution, I couldn&#39;t find a better one.</p>

<p>This house is on a bit of a hill, and is almost completely obscured by the water (I think you can barely see the roof).</p>

<p>This fits very well with the expected concealed height if you assume a spherical earth with ~6400 km radius.</p>

<p>Also for the sake of completeness, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Shiphorp.jpg">here&#39;s</a> an image of a ship half concealed by the horizon.</p>

<p>In my search for pictures I also stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth">this</a> wikipedia pages, which shows some additional (rather interesting in my opinion) methods how the earth radius has been measured (and of course, most of them also can serve as proof for a spherical earth).</p>

<p>Also, I appreciate you being surprisingly civil and rational about all of this. I honestly didn&#39;t expect that with how the rest of this thread looks like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I get it. You&#39;re in middle school, maybe a high school freshman, trying to make &quot;#cool&quot; and &quot;#edgy&quot; comments. Take at least one high school level physics class and you&#39;ll understand why you&#39;re wrong here. </p>

<p>For example: a plane leaves the ground going say, 1,100 mph relative to the ground. It leaves the ground in the same direction as the rotation of the earth. This means that relative to a fixed, unmoving point at the center of the earth, the plane is moving at a velocity of 2,100 mph. If the plane was moving opposite the direction of the rotation of the earth, it would be moving at 1,000 mph relative to the fixed point mentioned above. Why do we never really see things like this happening? Because nothing moves at 1,100 mph on the surface of the earth. This occurs because the linear velocity of the surface of the earth is added to the linear velocity of the plane while it is on the ground. </p>

<p>This answers your question about why those flights take the same amount of time: if the plane takes off with the rotation of the earth, then the plane is moving at a speed of 1,100 mph in relationship to the ground. Now, if the plane takes off against the rotation of the ground, the plane is moving at a speed of 100 mph in relation to the fixed point, the ground is moving at a speed of 1000 mph in relationship to the fixed point, and together, the plane is moving at a speed of 1,100 mph in relationship to the ground.</p>

<p>This can all be learned from a precalc course (angular momentum, linear momentum, linear velocity, simple introduction to vectors) and a physics course (multiple velocity vectors add together, an ability to visualize concepts).</p>

<p>Because the atmosphere is moving at a similar speed.  plus or minus a couple of miles per hour.</p>

<p>To illustrate. You are driving at 85 mph with your air conditioner on  and a fly is buzzing around you.</p>

<p>Sure if the initial acceleration would because the air in the balloon is resting, but right after the balloon would move back from then on. Those same youtube videos show this too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go to the southern hemisphere. Look at the night sky. On a flat Earth, you&#39;d see the same stars no matter where you were looking from. The southern hemisphere has a completely set of stars visible which straight up would not exist on a flat earth under a dome.</p>

<p>The sun cannot set on a flat Earth. If the Sun is ~40 miles across and 3000 miles high, even at the furthest point on it&#39;s circle away from you (i.e. when it should be set), it would still be ~13 degrees above the horizon and have an angular diameter of ~0.15 degrees, well above the human resolution limit of ~0.02 degrees. The Sun would absolutely be visible at all points during the course of it&#39;s movement.</p>

<p>We also know that the Sun doesn&#39;t just move in a small circle above us because we would see it get bigger and smaller as it move towards us and away from us. The Sun in the sky has an angular diameter of about half a degree and it&#39;s apparent diameter stays constant as it moves across the sky. As I said above, on a flat Earth we&#39;d expect it to be ~0.15 degrees at it&#39;s further point, and ~0.75 degrees when directly overhead, we don&#39;t see this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of them you can see in both hemispheres, if they&#39;re near the equator, or if you&#39;re near the equator you can see some of both. But for example, you <strong>cannot</strong> see Polaris from the southern hemisphere. Similarly, you <strong>cannot</strong> see the southern celestial pole (near Octans) from the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about seeing them upside down though, because in the southern hemisphere you&#39;re literally standing upside down compared to someone in the Northern hemisphere. How would this work on a flat plane where everybody is standing up the same way?</p>

<p>The earth rotates slowly. You can in fact see the stars move due to the Earth&#39;s rotation, it&#39;s not readily visible to the naked eye, but they do in fact move in circles around the north and south celestial poles over the course of the day/night. If you do a long exposure you get <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IAOZhbB.jpg">pretty patterns</a> of the circular paths.</p>

<p>I literally explained that the Sun would <strong>always</strong> be visible. At no point along it&#39;s path would it just disappear. Even if it did just disappear when it was far enough, like you&#39;re saying, you still haven&#39;t explained how it clearly moves down below the horizon when in the flat earth model it never moves below ~13° above the horizon.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t watch the whole video, I skipped through it a bit at a time before I had seen enough and got bored.</p>

<p>Firstly, it shows a picture of the Milky Way that the video says was taken by NASA. That picture is either an artist&#39;s representation, or a picture of a completely different galaxy. There are no pictures of our own galaxy from the outside because we can&#39;t go out there to take such a picture.</p>

<p>It then goes on to talk about how the Sun doesn&#39;t set above 65°N at the summer solstice. This is perfectly explained on a spherical Earth, the declination of the Sun at the summer solstice is +23.5°N, so it&#39;s high enough in the sky (celestial sphere) to never go below the horizon. Note that the latitude at which it is visible is 90°-declination. The sun is at a lower declination at other times and so the latitude above which the Sun never sets decreases between the spring equinox (when the Sun moves into the northern portion of the celestial sphere, +declination) to the summer solstice (declination = +23.5) (i.e. you have to be further north to see at the equinox than at the solstice), and then increases again from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, at which point the Sun moves into the southern portion of the celestial sphere. When the Sun is in the southern portion, you get permanent night at the North as it never rises above the horizon. As you approach the winter solstice the same thing happens for the south pole, the latitude at which the sun never sets increases from -90° at the autumnal equinox, to -66.5°, and then back up to -90° as we move back around to the spring equinox.</p>

<p>I feel like I maybe could explain the above celestial model a bit better, so if you have trouble understanding it just say so and I&#39;ll try again when I&#39;ve got more time. There&#39;s probably half a dozen other things wrong with the video I could go over as well.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here&#39;s the points I&#39;ve made broken down:</p>

<ul>
<li>On a flat earth, the Sun would always be visible as it wouldn&#39;t get far enough away to become too small to see. In the real world, it is not always visible.</li>
<li>On a flat earth, the Sun would never set and would always be far from the horizon. In the real world, it clearly sets.</li>
<li>Related to the above two points, the flat earth model cannot account for why you only get the midnight sun phenomenon above/below certain latitudes.</li>
<li>On a flat earth, the Sun would appear to increase in size and speed across the sky as it moves towards you and decrease in size and speed as it moves away. In the real world, the Sun always appears the same size and moves across the sky at a constant speed.</li>
<li>On a flat earth, the stars and constellation in the southern hemisphere of the celestial sphere literally do not exist. They clearly do from a simple look at the sky from the southern hemisphere on earth.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT2: Got my constellations mixed up, whoopsie!</p>

<p>EDIT3: Stars in the southern hemisphere also circle in the opposite direction to stars in the northern hemisphere (clockwise vs counterclockwise).</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s subjective to camera and eye lense. If we all had telescopes and we&#39;re on high enough elevation (or maybe had flat elevation without mountains and valleys we could see the sun forever as if it were a star. Same way we can se the moon in day time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In that video with the 10p coin, notice how the coin gets smaller as it gets further away, which the Sun does not do. The edge of the table in the video, representing the horizon, is also higher than the camera, whereas the horizon is always lower in real life.</p>

<p>The model in the star trails video doesn&#39;t work. The stars would never cross the horizon (hill/mountains in the way don&#39;t count as horizon) as they&#39;d always be at some position in the dome higher than the horizon. It also doesn&#39;t account for the fact that the stars literally move in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere, or the fact that the in a dome model you literally cannot have two hemispheres of stars!</p>

<p>When I say the Sun would always be visible on a flat Earth I&#39;m not using the real size and distance of the Sun, I&#39;m using the numbers given in the flat Earth model: 39 mile diameter, 3000 miles high. I used the real life size of the Earth because we can measure the circumference of the Earth to be 40000km and we know from travel times and survey data that the azimuthal equidistant map typically given to represent the flat Earth is grossly wrong and the distances towards the rim are inflated due to the nature of the projection. So,  the maximum distance from the Sun (far point on the equator) and an observer (on the rim) would be 30000km, giving an angular diameter of ~0.1 degrees, still larger than the lower limit of the human eye.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll watch your other video later if I&#39;ve got time.</p>

<p>Can you answer why we are supposedly moving:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>going 1040 mph, though it can be argued that this speed is cancelled out during half the day if the Earth is moing around the sun in the opposite direction you are travelling on the surface of Earth.. The Earth travels around the sun at 66, 666 mph. The Sun (our solar system) rotates around the center of the Milky Way at beween 420, 000 and 540, 000 mph. Finally, it is believed that the Milky Way is traveling or moving around a &quot;local group&quot; of galaxies at 2, 237, 000 mph. So, do the math</p>

<p>How come our stars have not changed in the 1000s of years of human recorded history? All of the constellations from ancient times are still here never changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s so incredibly asinine.  What are the credentials of the people who made these videos?  I was a satellite communications systems operator in the Army.  Those are my credentials.  Literally everything about the job, from the direction the antennas point (those dishes you see are called antennas) to the round trip time delay, the antenna tracking systems required that have to MOVE the antenna over time because many satellites do not orbit in a stationary spot, to the fact that no ground based antenna can transmit further than the horizon without tropospheric scattering, proves well enough that the satellites we connected to are in space, orbiting a round planet.  And I don&#39;t know if you actually watched these shite videos or just read the titles and was like &quot;Oh that sounds like it supports my belief system&quot; but they&#39;re so poorly made and so thoroughly debunked merely by the comments sections that you should be embarrassed.<br/>
Besides all that, I think the question you need to ask yourself is &quot;To What End?&quot;  What the hell would be the point of anyone telling people the Earth is round if it is really actually flat?  What benefit would someone gain by doing that?  In the opposite direction, all I can see the &quot;Flat Earthers&quot; gaining is their smug sense of superiority that they are somehow &quot;in the know&quot; and that the rest of us sheeple are not.  So please tell us all, what&#39;s the benefit.</p>

<p>Edit: Additionally you chose to ignore the first part of my answer.  Was it because you didn&#39;t (or weren&#39;t capable of) understanding it?  Or was it because you didn&#39;t want to address it due to the fact that it is correct and you are not?</p>

There&#39;s room I believe, for an additional ring(s) with eight (8) or more additional Sun and Moon disks that are thirty-two (32) miles wide <em>[perhaps made of diamond semiconductor and held in place with diamagnetic levitation]</em> daisy-chained above this possible ring just past Antarctica.</p>

<p>There&#39;s evidence for additional Suns <em>[and Moons]</em> too, in the Arctic there&#39;s twenty-four (24) hour sunlight for four (4) months; you can film the Sun going around in a circle. You also get nice curved star trails on long photographic exposures. However in Antarctica you get side-scrolling action; the Sun and stars go by like a two-dimensional (2D) side scrolling video game. The period where it&#39;s light for twenty-four (24) hours is only six (6) weeks long however. There&#39;s also a catch, the Sun is only visible scrolling by for twelve (12) hours of the twenty-four (24) hour period and the other twelve (12) is just light with no Sun visible.</p>

<p>On a side note, I&#39;d like to cover the topic of gravity I&#39;ve seen raised a few times here. It&#39;s actually that dense objects fall and light objects rise depending on their medium with æther being the case for an evacuated chamber <em>[space is fake/lie/hoaxed]</em>. Ultimately what defines up and down is the electric field.</p>

<p>Just like the ocean, air isn&#39;t all moving in the same direction and speed. There are currents at different depths/elevations where you may find high speeds. But it&#39;s mostly just eddies and vortexes.</p>

If you sit in a high speed train going 250km/h, and you are eating roasted cashews, you can throw the cashews into the air, and catch them with your mouth. They are not affected by the velocity of the train. Likewise you can stand in the aisle and sprint with the trains direction, and then run the opposite direction. No difference. </p>

<p>One of them finally said for the car experiment. There is no possible way to determine momentum or velocity in the car experiment from the inside unless the car changes direction/speed. So basically they are saying the same for for earth. So where&#39;s the evidence of a rotating earth? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstood what they meant. They were speaking about a completely closed system with no frame of reference outside of that system. That is why the train in the example is windowless and the track is completely smooth. With those two rules in place you won&#39;t feel the movement from hitting a bump or going around a bend and you have no landscape to view for another frame of reference. In that scenario you can&#39;t tell you are moving no matter how fast or slow you are going so long as the speed stays consistent. </p>

<p>If you placed a gigantic tarp around the Earths atmosphere to create the same system you wouldn&#39;t know you are moving unless you were on the outside. Since there is no tarp and we can see the stars, sun, moon, other planets, etc that are outside our &quot;train&quot; you know we are moving. </p>

<p>Your entire premise fails at the misunderstanding that only the solids are moving (the ground, buildings, etc) and that the atmosphere would be outside of our frame of reference. That is false. The atmosphere is part of our &quot;train&quot; that is hurtling through space and the landscape for our train is outer space. Anything you do on earth like running, jumping, taking a plane all follows the same rules as dropping a ball on a train or throwing a baseball back and forth on a train. Everything has the same constant exertion on it regardless of direction which makes it seem non existent. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just here to help provide some tools for you to provide evidence. You have to do the work yourself. I can help by pointing out some obvious errors in your analysis (for example, flights that have layovers that aren&#39;t controlled for), but ultimately you have to test the hypothesis. Don&#39;t let other people tell you what&#39;s what, get out there and see for yourself.

<p>Could you clarify this statement? It could either mean that the balloon stays above the same spot on Earth that it was released or that the Earth freely rotates while the balloon moves straight up. I would imagine that the balloon would be less and less effected by the air that moves with the rotation of the Earth as it rises higher into the atmosphere. The air would be less dense and less affected by the rotation of the Earth, so you really need to provide a source and explain in detail what you are actually claiming so that we can come to agreement. </p>

<p>Another excuse he googled was that the atmosphere moves along with the earth&#39;s rotation and that still doesn&#39;t explain why planes all take the same time back and forth. I also call bullshit on that atmosphere theory since there&#39;s no evidence of it moving anything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A plane must endure resistance to air in order to get from point A to point B. If the air moves with the Earth at the same speed, it means that it would take the same energy to go either direction on the planet. You still have to move through the same amount of air. If you have to move through the same amount of air, it will take the same amount of time. The only thing I would say here is that maybe as you get higher into the atmosphere (really high), you aren&#39;t as affected by the rotation of the air around the earth, so it might be slightly quicker in one direction. </p>

<p>Umm, forgive me if I&#39;m wrong, but if you are going in the opposite direction of the way the earth and atmosphere is moving, wouldn&#39;t there be more resistance, and either take longer or take more power/fuel? Wouldn&#39;t it be the equivalent of sailing with the wind, rather than against the wind? Going with should take less time, going against should take more time and more energy/fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it in terms of water instead of air. The water is moving at the same speed as the air above it. Imagine yourself sitting in the ocean while the Earth turns at 1000 miles per hour. Are you able to swim more quickly in one direction compared to the other? Of course not. You are moving through space with the water at the same speed. For all intents and purposes, you are still. Now, think of how much resistance the water gives you when you want to swim to a new location. Why would you think that swimming to a different location would be faster or slower? </p>

<p>The reason why cars and planes are aerodynamic is because there is resistance to the air. The air behaves pretty much like the water does, except not as severely restricting. </p>

<p>If the Earth is spinning at 1000 miles per hour, why would the air remain separate from the Earth? If you put a bit of spin on a ball, the ball affects the air around it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way (this is how I understand it). You are in a pool, you are moving around the edges to create a whirlpool. That is the atmosphere moving with earth in one direction. Once the current gets strong enough, you can kick back and are pushed relatively fast around the pool with little to no energy/resistance involved. Try swimming in the other direction, and you will need to exert more force/energy to travel the same distance. I could be way wrong, but this is my layman&#39;s understanding. Right or wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are pushed relatively fast around the pool, yes, but in your analogy, the surface of the earth is the surface of the water in the pool, not the bottom of the pool. In your analogy, the water inside the pool is the earth and the bottom and sides of the pool are the space in which earth is suspended. It makes sense if you really think about it: the earth is spinning relative to the space around it, just as the water is spinning relative to the concrete bottom and sides of the pool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once the current gets strong enough, you are moving along with the water. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you are moving in reference to the bottom of the pool. However, from the frame of reference of the water, you would be motionless, since you are moving at the same speed as the water; you are moving along with the water. If your frame of reference is the bottom of the pool, then of course it takes more energy to move against the current. But if your frame of reference is the surface of the water, then it would take the same amount of energy to move either way. If no energy is expended at all and you just float, you move at the same speed as the water, just like on earth if no energy is expended at all you move along with the ground. Think a little bit harder and it all makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to go back to your pool analogy, once you made a whirlpool in the water the &quot;tornado&quot; would be another smaller whirlpool in one section of the pool. If you remove the sides and bottom of the pool and had a suspended whirlpool of water that would be the earth and its atmosphere. Place some pool toys in random spots and those are now cities. They would move at the same rate you are moving in the whirlpool. Swimming from one to the other would take the same amount of time no matter which way you went because everything is moving at the same rate. So if the water is moving at 10 mph everything in the water moves at 10mph. If you can swim 1mph then going to point A with the current would mean you are gaining 1mph on that point as it is moving 10 and you are moving 11. Swimming back to your original point at 1mph would be the exact same time as you would be moving 9 mph with the current but the original point is moving 10 mph with the current or the distance between you and the point is closing at 1 mph. Tornadoes would be smaller whirlpools that have an isolated area of affect on a section of the pool but not the entire thing but would also be moving at 10mph with the current. So as you approached your resistance would change in that area but it&#39;s affects would be isolated to that area that&#39;s in constant motion with the current.</p>

<p>No. 1) The earth has gravity and pulls the water down and 2) the spinning tennis ball is spinning much faster than the earth relatively speaking. Remember that the Earth only spins once per day. The earth, spinning at 1000 miles per hour, is a little over 24,000 miles in circumference (24 hours per day at 1000 miles per hour = 24,000 miles around)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still not sure you&#39;re asking seriously, but for the sake of the argument - and posterity - earth&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity">escape velocity</a> is about 40,270 km/h (25,020 mph). Much, much faster than its rotation.</p>

<p>The atmosphere travels with it in the same way that it &quot;moves&quot; within a traveling car. </p>

<p>Your argument is the equivalent of being inside a windowless car driving on a smooth road, and thinking you&#39;re not moving because hey, it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re moving and when you toss a ball it falls straight down. 
(Hope that doesn&#39;t come off as condescending - I&#39;m just drawing an analogy here. Nothing wrong with genuinely questioning things one is spoon-fed.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, you&#39;re conflating acceleration with momentum. In a car that&#39;s <em>increasing its speed</em>, the object will indeed be pushed back (actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8mzDvpKzfY">forward in the case of a balloon</a> due to fluid dynamics and the buoyancy of helium vs. air). </p>

<p>But earth didn&#39;t &quot;just start the ride&quot;, nor is it accelerating (I hope you didn&#39;t get the idea that it <em>is</em> accelerating from anywhere). Earth is the equivalent of mid ride at a fixed speed, on a smooth road. Drop a ball and it&#39;ll fall straight down.</p>

<p>Sure if the initial acceleration would because the air in the balloon is resting, but right after the balloon would move back from then on. Those same youtube videos show this too.</p>

<p>Then if you can&#39;t prove the car experiment or the rotating earth from the inside then surely you can from the outside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo!!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take this thought a step further.</p>

<p>You do not feel, hear, or see anything that is constant.  If there was a sound that sounded and NEVER had any intervals (meaning it was perfectly sounding non-stop forever without change in volume, pitch, tone, source, or quality), you wouldn&#39;t hear it.  We can only detect the intervals.  We can only detect CHANGE.  It&#39;s just how our systems of experience work.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re on a perfectly flat surface and you move forward at a consistent rate of speed indefinitely, you wouldn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re moving.</p>

<p>Just like you don&#39;t feel the Earth spin, and you don&#39;t feel the Earth orbit the Sun and you don&#39;t feel the Sun move from its place in the galaxy, and you don&#39;t feel the galaxy&#39;s rotation, and you don&#39;t feel the galaxy&#39;s movement in space itself.</p>

<p>If you walk forward at 1 MPH on a 1000 MPH conveyer belt, you go forward at 1000+1 = 1001 MPH.  If you walk backwards on it, you go 1000-1 = 999.  However, according to your logic, you&#39;re suggesting 1000 - 1 = -1.</p>

<p>To put it another way, when you are considering the plane&#39;s speed going with rotation, you are factoring in the rotation of the earth, but when you consider the plane&#39;s speed going the opposite speed, you&#39;re not factoring the rotation at all.  To compare it to the conveyor belt analogy, that&#39;s like saying you measure forward speed relative to the ground the conveyor belt is on, yet you measure backward speed relative to the actual belt (and the other things on it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naw here&#39;s where the logic comes in.</p>

<p>if we are moving 1000 mph on a conveyor belt eastward we would be moving 1000 mph forward if we go east.</p>

<p>If we try to go westward we would be going backwards 1000 mph. Thats why I say negative. Sure We MIGHT Be Going 1000 Mph - Our Speed. But it is not the direction we want.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a treadmill the only way to go past it is to move faster. </p>

<p>Which is more likely, that some amateurs making YouTube videos faked some shit and/or are talking out of their ass or that hundreds upon thousands of scientists are involved in a secret conspiracy to convince civilians that the earth is spherical (for no reason)???</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If the planet is rotating at 1000MPH, how come there is no evidence of it influencing anything off the ground?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is evidence. It&#39;s why the US launches rockets from Florida and not California. You want the rocket to be launched over the ocean, so if it explodes, it will fall into the ocean and not over a city. Since the Earth rotates towards the East, you pick Florida (east coast) because you can launch the rocket in the same direction the Earth is rotating and you get that 1000 mph speed boost. If you launched from California (west coast), you would have to fight that rotation and it would require a much more powerful rocket.<br/>
The only space program in the world to go against the Earth&#39;s rotation is Israel. They launch towards the west in order to launch over the Mediterranean and not the surrounding countries towards the East. This is a costly problem for them, as they have to build their rockets to be more powerful to overcome the Earth&#39;s rotation.<br/>
We also pick Florida because it&#39;s closest to the equator, and being that the equator is farthest away from the Earth&#39;s core, it&#39;s give you the maximum angular velocity and allows for cost reduction.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you take a plane from Africa to the Philippines that arrives in 5 hours, why the fuck does it also take 5 hours to go from the Philippines to Africa?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s another way to look at this. The rotation of the Earth doesn&#39;t have an affect on plane travel, since it&#39;s still in the atmosphere of the Earth, which is all moving at the same speed. It&#39;s like the car example people have been giving you. If you throw a ball in the air while you are in an enclosed car, the ball comes back to you (it doesn&#39;t hit the back window) because the atmosphere inside the car is moving at the same speed as the car. If you were to open the convertible top and throw the ball, it would be taken towards the back because the ball has transcended the car atmosphere. This is similar to the rocket being launched. The rocket transcends the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, and the rotation of the Earth actually matters, thus the reason for launching East. </p>

Thinking that people who support flat earth theory are so stupid that they can&#39;t comprehend a photo like that is condescending itself.  The fact of the matter is if you dig into it, we don&#39;t have real photos of earth.  Plenty of evidence that the Apollo missions were fake and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZvuZ4q2ZWc">NASA only gives us these CGI imaginings</a>.

I thought it was completely ridiculous until a couple months ago when I decided to actually look at what was out there.  I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with how smart a person is.  Just how willing they are to consider the alternative.  I think if someone seriously reviews it, they&#39;ll at least come to the conclusion that we don&#39;t know for sure it&#39;s a sphere and TPTB have been trying very hard to make us think it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s actually a better way to put this question. The one you put forward can be explained <em>on the surface</em> by relativity (Nevermind why the atmosphere would be spinning with the earth.  I still haven&#39;t found a good explanation for that.)</p>

<p>Lets say I was on the equator and flew to Michigan. The speed at the equator, according to Google, is 1037mph. At the 44th degree latitude, the earth&#39;s speed would be cos(44) * 1037 = 0.719 * 1037 = 745mph. So there would be a 292mph difference in horizontal velocity of the earth beneath when you go to land.  Even if the atmosphere is spinning as well, you should still maintain most if not all of that horizontal momentum in the air.  As far as I&#39;ve been able to dig up, planes don&#39;t account for this in their flight paths or while they&#39;re in the air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but that&#39;s not measuring curvature unless I walk in a straight line for at least 20 miles.</p>

<p>Curvature of the earth is supposedly 8 inches per mile yet the Bedford Levels Experiment disproved this. Ever since then, people have been disproving the curvature of the earth over and over. You can see Chicago from across Manhattan Beach with a telescope or a camera with great zoom. There&#39;s a news report of Kansas being totally flat with 0 curvature. The 100 mile long salt lake in Bolivia is flat all across. All these examples can be seen in the video in the OP. It is physically impossible to see any of these things on a curved plane. Canals, bridges, railroads ect never ever have to take curvature into account.  You can ask any engineer.  It&#39;s elevation and hills they have to account for. But for ones on flat planes they can stretch forever with never curving.</p>

<p>A plane must endure resistance to air in order to get from point A to point B. If the air moves with the Earth at the same speed, it means that it would take the same energy to go either direction on the planet. You still have to move through the same amount of air. If you have to move through the same amount of air, it will take the same amount of time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm, forgive me if I&#39;m wrong, but if you are going in the opposite direction of the way the earth and atmosphere is moving, wouldn&#39;t there be more resistance, and either take longer or take more power/fuel? Wouldn&#39;t it be the equivalent of sailing with the wind, rather than against the wind? Going with should take less time, going against should take more time and more energy/fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what you aren&#39;t grasping. We know there&#39;s air all around us.</p>

<p>But where is the evidence that the earth is rotating at 1000mph?</p>

<p>The earth only rotates 1 direction so why do all flights no matter if they are going east or west have no difference in travel times?</p>

<p>Everything and everyone is supposedly moving 1000mph yet we don&#39;t feel it and can&#39;t change it. Where is the evidence we are moving at all? If we jump nothing happens. If we fly nothing changes. So how the fuck are we going to all fling to our deaths if the earth stops?(Looking at you askreddit, askscience,  TIL)</p>

Maybe we are stationary and everything else spins, maybe the planet is vastly larger than we know with much hidden land (past the pole ice ).....

<p>3 and 4 had actual content but really potatopeg tier images. Is that really the best they can do? We have telescopes and cameras that can see the craters of the moon and Mars yet we can&#39;t see satellites in space?</p>

<p>Got any videos zooming into a satellite? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that were the case, stars would over time change and NOT operate on the cyclic pattern they currently are on. Seriously, how can you be this dense? Look at over exposures of Polaris. Buy a camera and go a trip starting from as far north as you can go and make stops all the way to the equator. You will eventually lose site of Polaris along the way and your stupid idea of a flat earth will be dead.</p>
