<p>and cares about exposing corrupt leaders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so when he was giving these same politicians &#39;millions&#39; as he keeps saying he did, he didn&#39;t know they were corrupt back then? ...when he was giving his money to &#39;evil&#39; foundations like those supported by the Clintons, don&#39;t think he knew how corrupt they were and have always been? Come on....Trump is smarter than that, and as all politicians will say whatever he thinks will get him elected. If he gets elected then we&#39;ll see what he does, but honestly if you think trump&#39;s going to get elected and keep being the anti-establishment guy he now claims to be I say you&#39;re dreaming buddy. He&#39;s going to become the establishment and round and round we go while the real players stay safely hidden behind the curtains of ignorance</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so.  I think he actually cares about the country and it&#39;s people, and tells the establishment to their faces that he doesn&#39;t want or need their money.  He&#39;s the only candidate that can say that, or has the balls to say that, and that&#39;s why I want him in the office.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they did like taking his contributions.  He has said it himself that it is a corrupt practice but that&#39;s the way we do business in America.  He could easily take 10 times that much from lobbyists, elite donors, and corporations, but says keep it.  That why everyone is excited about him as a President who actually is not beholden to the powers that be.  But in the end, yes we will have to see and I&#39;m still skeptical, but more hopeful than I have been in a long time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we have to open it,” Trump told Fox and Friends this morning, per Politico. </p>

<p>“The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,” Apple CEO Cook said. “But that’s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks — from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While everyone is debating this BS, no one is reading the report where the FBI had already reset the necessary password for that phone&#39;s account. They accessed the data they needed, then had someone randomly change the passcode. Then they requested the backdoor BS you see now.</p>

<p>It is fake as hell. The FBI already has the data they need from the phone. They are escalating this narrative to set a precedent no sane person would want.</p>

<p>Not to disagree or argue, but like to point out that Sanders has not taken a dime from the establishment as well. Bernie also is the only candidate on both sides who can say he has never personally been apart of the establishment. </p>

<p>I like to think of them as two sides of the outsider. One is the definition of a progressive and the other is the definition of American pride. Amazing we have this happening in both parties at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These claims of similarity are superficial.  Trump has no interest in destroying private health insurance companies or truly reforming our healthcare.  His plan is to remove state border laws for insurance companies so that they all act on a more country level instead of state level.  They want to audit government institutions for very different reasons which leads to very different results.  Trump has always said he wants the biggest and best military we have ever had: cut waste but dump more money in it.  Sanders thinks we can cut waste and maybe shrink it and still be happy.  Basically their only similar features are not taking money from corporations/rich and being outsiders.</p>
