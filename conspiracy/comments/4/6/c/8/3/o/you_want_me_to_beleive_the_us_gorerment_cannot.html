I think their just going through the motions so they can say Apple helped us. In reality i know they have the best minds working for them and they have been able to get encrypted data off any phone they want to in about 29  minutes, na mean? Joke is on the public</p>

I mean hell dude, they have bots that control upvotes and downvotes, and can control the direction of posts and conversations. Thats a real thing. They can capture data at any point on the internet, but somehow they need to get passed a passcode for some special file that wasn&#39;t sent to him or ever sent through the internet ever?

<p>From a tech perspective, it&#39;s completely different than upvote bots on reddit, or even capturing internet traffic. If I intercept an internet communication, I can run a computer cluster for months at a time to break the encryption, and the data&#39;s still there. </p>

<p>Iphone supposedly has a feature where after a certain number of failed passcode attempts, the data on the phone is deleted. They may be lying, but it&#39;s a different problem with a different set of solutions than the examples you raised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding, it&#39;s not even an issue of strong encryption, it&#39;s a matter of Apple having a failsafe such that the device will destroy all private data if the passcode is entered incorrectly 10 times.

    <div class="md"><p>I always think that if someone can&#39;t be bothered to look up the grammar for simple words, then how can I trust them to research anything properly? 
Hence their opinion somewhat loses it&#39;s impact.
It also helps with understanding what is being said.
I don&#39;t mind foreigners getting it wrong or spelling mistakes because of using a phone but deliberate ignorance as a native English speaker to common words is doesn&#39;t look too good.</p>
