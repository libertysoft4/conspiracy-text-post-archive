        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People seem to think they would know if they were living in a fascist police state. Yet, we’ve seen throughout history that it&#39;s very difficult to judge one&#39;s own time objectively. </p>

<p>Do you think people at Nazi rallies in the 1930s made a conscious decision to turn to the dark side? “Hey honey, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about this for some time. I’ve decided to go ahead and become evil. Fascism and mass death are just really in right now; I hope you understand.” </p>

<p>Of course not. The Nazis came in and turned the economy around, created millions of jobs, and enjoyed widespread support. There are Germans alive to this day who say the pre-war years were the happiest of their life. And yet we look back today and say, “wow they were living under a comic book level of evil. Luckily nothing like that could ever happen here.” </p>

<p>Hmmmm… </p>

<p>Doesn’t Chicago have a <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/chicago-cops-detained-7-000-secret-interrogation-center-article-1.2404256">secret prison</a> where Americans are tortured and held without trial? </p>

<p>Doesn’t the U.S. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#Human_rights_violations_by_graduates">train Latin American dictators and right-wing death squads</a> at the US School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Goergia? A brief look at this school’s alumni list includes Manuel Noriega (infamous dictator/drug trafficker), Emilio Massera (mastermind of Argentina’s Dirty War), and the founders of the Zetas Cartel.</p>

<p>Didn’t William Binney, a legend at the NSA, who worked there for 32 years and eventually became its Technical director, call the organization’s current surveillance practices “a totalitarian process – [it] means we are now in a police state.&quot; Didn’t the FBI then raid Binney’s house, push his young son aside, and hold him at gunpoint? <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/united-states-of-secrets/the-frontline-interview-william-binney/">Source</a></p>

<p>Didn&#39;t a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746">major Princeton University study</a> determine the US is no longer a democracy? This study determined we live in an Oligarchy and concluded: &quot;When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organised interests, they generally lose.&quot;</p>

<p>Haven’t we been in a continuous state of National Emergency since 1976? Here’s what the Michigan Journal of Law has to say about this matter: “Unbeknownst to most Americans the United States is presently under thirty presidential declared states of emergency. They confer vast powers on the Executive Branch including the ability to financially incapacitate any person or organization in the United States, seize control of the nation’s communications infrastructure, mobilize military forces, expand the permissible size of the military without congressional authorization, and extend tours of duty without consent from service personnel. Declared states of emergency may also activate Presidential Emergency Action Documents and other continuity-of-government procedures which confer powers on the President, such as the unilateral suspension of habeas corpus—that appear fundamentally opposed to the American constitutional order.” <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/10/31/fascism-american-style/">Source</a> </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t the General Education Board, which helped establish public education in the United States in the early 20th century, write the following (this is a real quote - check the source!): &quot;In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands. The present education conventions fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning, or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supply.&quot; <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QzhDAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=limitless&amp;f=false">Source</a></p>

<p>Didn’t JFK’s Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BiNSJDfjoPwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=that+there+exists,+beyond+doubt,+an+international+High+Cabal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LPGMdQh1IC&amp;sig=mZmqh-kWuZAppdY68BXV5JWN280&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSr5PejorLAhUJaT4KHbqmA-gQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=that%20there%20exists%2C%20beyond%20doubt%2C%20an%20international%20High%20Cabal&amp;f=false">openly write</a> “that there exists, beyond doubt, an international High Cabal?” By the way, this man (L. Fletcher Prouty) won 15 medals for his military and government service and exposed everything in a book called <em>The Secret Team</em>. Check it out, folks. </p>

<p>Didn’t Michael Hastings say he was being followed by the FBI and needed “to go off the radar” the same day that his car blow up? Didn’t the former U.S. Counter-terrorism Czar Richard Clarke say the crash was ”consistent with a car cyber attack?” 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_(journalist">Source</a></p>

<p>Aren’t we subjected to constant propaganda? The U.S. military pays the NFL millions of dollars each year to showcase soldiers and veterans at halftime. The DoD works hand in hand with Hollywood; for example, a Defense Department report stated Transformers III “will give us the opportunity to schowcase the bravery and values of our soldiers and the excellent technology of today’s Army to a global audience.” In fact, a 1948 law that outlawed domestic propaganda in the U.S. was repealed in 2013. <a href="http://www.legendary-peace.com/2015/09/america-has-as-much-propaganda-as-north.html">Source</a></p>

<p>As many of us know, doesn’t the U.S. have 5% of the world’s population, but incarcerate 25% of the world’s prisoners? Don’t many of those prisoner’s work making military equipment and corporate goods for next to nothing? Haven’t we invaded 50 countries since the end of WWII? How are we not an empire, exactly? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed we are. That&#39;s why every protest ends with police shooting and beating. Non-conformity isn&#39;t tolerated ultimately. That&#39;s why it&#39;s good we have cameras to document the impunity with which police enforce the laws that make the state ever more powerful. This behavior has a label called soft authoritarianism. Though it&#39;s becoming less soft everyday.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to get beat hard by the pigs if we&#39;re doing the right thing, even shot. If we allow them to continue, without protest, they become appeased. The blood will flow from nations not just streets then.</p>

<p>When will people learn that bigger nations just cause bigger problems.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no place on this earth that isn&#39;t ruled by a government. Some places are just less able to be actually controlled because of their remoteness, and they don&#39;t matter to the government as they pose no real threat or gain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! Don&#39;t forget that the CIA/Military imported a lot of Nazis into the US after the end of WW2. These people did not suddenly become leftists. It is also worthwhile to recall that the US 1% support Hitler, and while Hitler did get the German economy moving again, he did it by outlawing labour unions and strikebreaking. </p>

<p>There is a nice list of the properties of fascist states on the web, and the US meets nearly all of them.</p>

<p>The big differences between then and now are 1. Technology. They can do things now that were only dreams for the Nazis. 2. Financial Control. They have endebted us all to the point where we are effectively slaves for them. 3. Near world-wide control. The only countries not in their system are North Korea, Iran, and Cuba. The rest they can turn off their banks at their will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many people (mainly leftists who would be considered proto-marxists) don’t have a fucking clue what fascism is and think that a cronyist oligarchy is fascism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think people at Nazi rallies in the 1930s made a conscious decision to turn to the dark side?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your list of evil basically goes Satan (or “lol who” if you’re a fedora), the nebulous concept of fascism, killing children that aren’t inside women, white people, etc.? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet we look back today and say, “wow they were living under a comic book level evil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re oblivious to history, yeah, you say that. There’s a character limit and I’m fucking stuck with one post every nine minutes because a lunatic brigaded me, or I’d post endless evidence that this is just nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are we not an empire, exactly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who ever said anything about that? The problem is the globalism, not America. All of this stuff comes from selling your country to the devil. Demons, rather.</p>

<p>They didn’t want us isolationist. They didn’t want us to have specie. We’re their puppet, just like everyone else is. <em>And?</em></p>

<p>&quot;I would totally school you with facts but I can&#39;t because of the post limit&quot; was basically his main argument. He&#39;s also refuting the least important things OP said, his intro and conclusion. None of the important stuff in the middle (ya know, what the post is about) was mentioned, so I&#39;m not sure if he even read it all.</p>

<p>The difference between oligarchy and fascism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You don’t watch a whole lot of Fox, do you? That’s not at all how they operate.</p>

<p>[citation needed]</p>

<p>By virtue of the definition of the word, the purpose for the mass downvotes was illegitimate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you obviously aren’t trying to even promote a discussion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m directly refuting your points. That’s basically what a discussion is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>quell the foundation of an idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Only</em> because it’s incorrect. Not because of its existence or its source.</p>

<p>Liberals tend to have a problem with that; they can’t envision the concept of discourse itself, choosing instead to violently (emotionally, irrationally, and in a way that speaks to psychological damage) attack contradictory viewpoints. They go so far as to, well, eat each other. Because eventually they HAVE to.</p>

<p>The idea of dissent is so foreign to them that their cognitive dissonance regarding it makes them behave as though they’re not mentally stable.</p>

<p>But that’s liberals, and that’s another topic.</p>
