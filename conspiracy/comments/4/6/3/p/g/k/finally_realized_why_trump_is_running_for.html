        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I finally get it. I finally understand why Donald TRUMP is running for president. </p>

<p>I&#39;d long been confused why a man with so much private sector success would blow up his comfortable position among the billionaire elites of America. It&#39;s always seemed like he had so much to lose, with the tarnish to his name and brand, not to mention lost business. I always just assumed he was a super good guy who actually cares about the plight of the average American…</p>

<p>But the other night during the debate, everything became clear.</p>

<p>In a heated exchange with Jeb! &quot;Turtles&quot; Bush, TRUMP finally revealed his true power level. He&#39;s been hinting at his knowledge of the Jews and their duplicity for months now with his &quot;we don&#39;t even know our allies in the Middle East&quot; line, but after last night there is no mistaking it. Here&#39;s what he said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>TRUMP: How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center – the World – excuse me. I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe, Marco. That is not safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t about politics. This is personal. They killed his friends, and now they must die.</p>

<p>The Jews killed hundreds of Donald&#39;s friends on 9/11. For fifteen years he&#39;s been planning his revenge. He filled his war chest with billions of dollars, knowing full well the Jews would try to bankrupt him out of his candidacy. He sacrificed his beloved daughter, Ivanka, to the Jews, giving him plausible deniability against charges of antisemitism. According to his ex-wife Ivana, he studied the works of Adolf Hitler in secret. No price was too high for what they did to him. He will have his revenge.</p>

<p>Anyone who&#39;s read Art of the Deal will know that TRUMP is 100% redpilled to the actions of the Jewish menace. The first chapter of his best-selling book is basically him calling Jews up all around NYC and putting them in their place. Nobody makes that much money in NYC without knowing how to play against the Jews. The Jewish evilness TRUMP has personally witnessed must be hard to imagine.</p>

<p>This is the true reason the (((GOPe))) is so terrified of Donald TRUMP. He knows the truth, and they know what they did to him. He&#39;ll stop at nothing to see his revenge against the Jews that killed all his friends. </p>

<p>May God have mercy on their souls, because TRUMP surely won&#39;t.</p>

<p>P.S. I had to edit this and resubmit because a mod removed it for having a racial slur in the post. Great rule to have for easy censorship purposes <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods.</p>

<p>Is that sarcasm? Dude, no Billionaire actually cares about the plight of the average American, especially not Trump. But can I have some of what you&#39;re smoking?</p>

<p>And last I checked Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Myers and Eberhard are not Jewish. So are you saying they&#39;re innocent? Or that they&#39;re controlled by wealthy Jews? And if they&#39;re controlled by wealthy Jews, what do you think is a more relevant aspect of the controller&#39;s power, that they&#39;re wealthy or that they&#39;re Jewish?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps that&#39;s what that &#39;smoke signal&#39; (I think it was actually steam) from the trade center/freedom tower on the night Trump won in New Hampshire was all about. The JWO hitting the panic button.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to think so, but unfortunately, while Trump is obviously driven, fearless and a proven success story, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s really all that smart. The interesting factor is his how smart his kids and wife might be. </p>

<p>One thing for sure. Of all the candidates in the race, Trump is the only one idiosyncratic enough that you can almost imagine him opening up that particular can of jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You convinced me halfway -- He&#39;s in it for revenge. I&#39;ve had similar thoughts, but I thought it was more about NEW YORK CITY -- his home, where he grew up, where he&#39;s centered his business and career and family -- than friends. I don&#39;t know that Donald Trump has any real friends. Maybe. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think this is about &quot;The Jews.&quot; I think this is about the Bush crime syndicate, and Trump stepping up to stop Jeb and humiliate the Bush family. Maybe even re-open 9/11 when/if he gets elected president. </p>
