    <div class="md"><p>I think it might be because conspiracy theories threaten the order underpinning the world in most people&#39;s minds. If &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; are right, then everything they think they know is wrong. This has major implications for them - all of a sudden nothing is certain, nothing is trustworthy, and their own intelligence is impugned because they weren&#39;t able to see the deceit beforehand. Since that causes too much shock to the ego, most people have a kneejerk reaction automatically attacking the person or people or ideas that threaten their understanding of the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cognitive dissonance. People can not handle things that could shatter their world perspective. It goes beyond that, though, and it really makes people think. I think at the end of the day, they truly do not want to think and/or experience what it may do to them, mentally. I don&#39;t blame them, really. </p>

<p>Rabbits holes will change you (I say for the better, but they may disagree). Some have been down more than others. Some have the ability to do it, while others do not. These kinds of things lead to a life of introspection, and it&#39;s pretty lonely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth. It is lonely. I have been jumping headfirst into various rabbitholes for a very long time, and have in the last 2 or 3 years been starting to get people that were sure I was batshit crazy come back around and tell me how right I was. Still lonely. Just in the past few weeks I have had the opportunity to spend some time with a former Marine, one of the smartest, most educated and creative people have met in a long time. Unfortunately the cognitive dissonance is strong in this one, and while he has no problem discussing mkultra/monarch programming, i sat through him telling me flat earth is a thing...unfortunately this beautiful soul is trying to cope with various cancers, and PTSD and the VA denying claims and treatment. In his situation am trying not to completely shatter him, while giving him undeniable morsels of truth. This is going to be a long haul, but one at a time, each one, teach one...edit for fixing autocorrect bullshit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because you are exposing and attacking them.  Although they won&#39;t admit it to themselves, they have bought into and invested in the system we have today.  You threaten to expose all the paper currency they value so highly as worthless, The half of their life spent receiving education, as just receiving propaganda...  their social status and self worth is all based on the system...  The fact they prosper from living inside the empire,  the fact that they get to be a landlord-land owner of community land, without paying it&#39;s true cost to the community.......   Believe it or not they are spiritually sick and invested in this system u are trying to expose.</p>

<p>Address this spiritual issue with them first, if you want to reach them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>be wary that this presumption applies to both conspiracy theorists and deniers. </p>

<p>for example someone might think &quot;9/11 went exactly as the media said it did, I&#39;m a patriotic citizen&quot;. that becomes part of their concept of self/ego. anything contradicting that thought is an attack on their psychological well being. so they ignore it. Telling them &quot;well maybe the gov&#39;t wants an endless war and a thriving war economy&quot;, is probably going to be ignored, for the sake of that person&#39;s psychological well being, like you said.</p>

<p>however, someone else might think satan or jews are behind things, that concept becomes part of their ego the same way. they become &quot;an enlightened theorist who sees beyond the lies of mass media&quot;. and that&#39;s when the same argument applies. the same contradicting evidence of the contrary is ignored.</p>

<p>what matters in the end is self reflection and examining what exactly one&#39;s own ego consists of and why. there are as many ignorant, &quot;ego protecting&quot; people here as there are watching fox news or CNN 24/7. people typically like ignoring grey areas too, those are more difficult to comprehend than polarized views. again, psychological comfort trumps that too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; has become a catch-all for anyone who dares to oppose the history that has been presented as &quot;fact&quot; to the public. If you shoot down any thought that may be &quot;revolutionary&quot; to some, you completely rule out things that actually took place and were hidden from the public. Talking about Kissinger, or god forbid the FED, can basically equate you to a flat earth supporter. </p>

<p>No one can separate fact from fiction now so it may as well all be fiction. But we can all trust CNN for the TRUTH. Funny how that works....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are not shamed for being fat and stupid. That would be insensitive. Our celebrities and media are basically promoting idiocy and herd mentality. Surprisingly, it&#39;s not so taboo to make fun of someone for reading or being good at math. Religion has its role in why this is the case. Accept your flaws and tell your fellow man to abandon thought in favor of blind belief? Moronic and dangerous are these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth. It is lonely. I have been jumping headfirst into various rabbitholes for a very long time, and have in the last 2 or 3 years been starting to get people that were sure I was batshit crazy come back around and tell me how right I was. Still lonely. Just in the past few weeks I have had the opportunity to spend some time with a former Marine, one of the smartest, most educated and creative people have met in a long time. Unfortunately the cognitive dissonance is strong in this one, and while he has no problem discussing mkultra/monarch programming, i sat through him telling me flat earth is a thing...unfortunately this beautiful soul is trying to cope with various cancers, and PTSD and the VA denying claims and treatment. In his situation am trying not to completely shatter him, while giving him undeniable morsels of truth. This is going to be a long haul, but one at a time, each one, teach one...edit for fixing autocorrect bullshit</p>
