    <div class="md"><p>A redditor pointed out yesterday that Scalia may well have been inclined to take on the Oregon ranchers case. Given that there&#39;s evidence out there that the FBI&#39;s account of Fincum&#39;s shooting is bullshit and they planted a gun on him, Scalia may very well have been sympathetic to the Constitutionalists and could have been involved in a massive case. </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what they said you&#39;d be saying when they planned it out. That&#39;s why they did no autopsy. Because, they <em>knew</em> that there would be enough people like you who would say that. They are determining how many people trust them so much as to require no proof of events. They offer no video or photo proof of the spectacular events that shape your world.</p>

<p>And now, they took it a step further by taking-out a SCJ of our republic without having provide you any proof of their story, all made possible by a weird chain of locals in command that was all literally phoned-in.</p>
