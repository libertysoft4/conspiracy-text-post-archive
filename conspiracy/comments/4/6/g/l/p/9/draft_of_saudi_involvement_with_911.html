<p>Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, a bond-trading firm that lost 658 employees in the World Trade Center attacks, files a $7 billion lawsuit against the government of Saudi Arabia for allegedly supporting al-Qaeda prior to 9/11. The lawsuit names dozens of other defendants, including many Saudi banks and Islamic charities. Many of the defendants had also been named in the still-pending $300 billion Ron Motley lawsuit (see August 15, 2002). The Cantor Fitzgerald lawsuit claims the Saudi Arabian government “knew and intended that these Saudi-based charity and relief organization defendants would provide financial and material support and substantial assistance to al-Qaeda.… This uninterrupted financial and material support and substantial assistance enabled the al-Qaeda defendants to plan, orchestrate and carry out the Sept. 11 attacks.” [ASSOCIATED PRESS, 9/3/2004]</p>

<p>The Saudi government revokes bin Laden’s citizenship and moves to freeze his assets in Saudi Arabia because of his support for Muslim fundamentalist movements. [NEW YORK TIMES, 4/10/1994; PBS FRONTLINE, 2001] However, allegedly, this is only a public front and they privately continue to support him as part of a secret deal allegedly made in 1991 (see Summer 1991). In fact, bin Laden will travel to Albania as part of an official Saudi delegation later in the month (see Shortly After April 9, 1994). The Saudis were said to have been pressured into this move after US officials privately met with Saudi officials and confronted them with satellite images of al-Qaeda training camps in northern Sudan. [DER SPIEGEL (HAMBURG), 6/6/2005] But Alain Chouet, head of the French intelligence subdivision tracking terrorist movements, will later claim that bin Laden’s “loss of Saudi nationality is nothing but a farce.” [LE MONDE (PARIS), 4/15/2007]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2004, the Los Angeles Times will report that, according to some 9/11 Commission members and US counterterrorism officials, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia cut secret deals with the Taliban and bin Laden before 9/11. These deals date to this year, if not earlier, and will successfully shield both countries from al-Qaeda attacks until long after 9/11. “Saudi Arabia provid[es] funds and equipment to the Taliban and probably directly to bin Laden, and [doesn’t] interfere with al-Qaeda’s efforts to raise money, recruit and train operatives, and establish cells throughout the kingdom, commission and US officials [say]. Pakistan provide[s] even more direct assistance, its military and intelligence agencies often coordinating efforts with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, they [say].” The two countries will become targets of al-Qaeda attacks only after they launch comprehensive efforts to eliminate the organization’s domestic cells. In Saudi Arabia, such efforts won’t begin until late 2003. [LOS ANGELES TIMES, 7/16/2004] However, such allegations go completely unmentioned in the 9/11 Commission’s final report, which only includes material unanimously agreed upon by the ten commissioners.

<p>Saudi Arabia announces that Turki al-Faisal will be its next ambassador to Britain. Turki is a controversial figure because of his long-standing relationship to bin Laden. He has also been named in a lawsuit (see August 15, 2002) by 9/11 victims’ relatives against Saudi Arabians for their support of al-Qaeda before 9/11. It is later noted that his ambassador position could give him diplomatic immunity from the lawsuit. [NEW YORK TIMES, 12/30/2002] Turki’s predecessor as ambassador was recalled after it was revealed he had written poems praising suicide bombers. [OBSERVER, 3/2/2003] Articles reporting on his new posting suggest that Turki last met bin Laden in the early 1990s, before bin Laden became wanted by the US for his anti-American militancy. [LONDON TIMES, 10/18/2002; GUARDIAN, 10/19/2002] However, these reports fail to mention other reported contacts with bin Laden, including a possible secret meeting in 199</p>

It is also in response to a lawsuit against many Saudi Arabians that also may lead to a freeze of Saudi assets (see August 15, 2002).

<p>Two months after the US embassy bombings in Africa (see 10:35-10:39 a.m., August 7, 1998), FBI agent Robert Wright and his Vulgar Betrayal investigation discover evidence they think ties Saudi multimillionaire Yassin al-Qadi to the bombings.</p>

<p>ABC News will report in 2002, “According to US officials, al-Qadi [has] close personal and business connections with the Saudi royal family.” [ABC NEWS, 11/26/2002] Wright later will allege that FBI headquarters even attempted to shut down the Vulgar Betrayal investigation altogether at this time. He says, “They wanted to kill it.” [ABC NEWS, 12/19/2002] However, he will claim, “Fortunately an assistant special agent in Chicago interceded to prevent FBI headquarters from closing Operation Vulgar Betrayal.” [FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE, 6/2/2003] He claims that a new supervisor will write in late 1998, “Agent Wright has spearheaded this effort despite embarrassing lack of investigative resources available to the case, such as computers, financial analysis software, and a team of financial analysts. Although far from being concluded, the success of this investigation so far has been entirely due to the foresight and perseverance of Agent Wright.” [FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE, 5/30/2002] When the story of this interference in the alleged al-Qadi-embassy bombings connection will be reported in late 2002, Wright will conclude, “September the 11th is a direct result of the incompetence of the FBI’s International Terrorism Unit. No doubt about that. Absolutely no doubt about that. You can’t know the things I know and not go public.” He will remain prohibited from telling all he knows, merely hinting, “There’s so much more. God, there’s so much more. A lot more.” [ABC NEWS, 12/19/2002]</p>

Journalist Seymour Hersh will later write, “according to an official with knowledge of their contents, the intercepts show that the Saudi government, working through Prince Salman [bin Abdul Aziz], contributed millions to charities that, in turn, relayed the money to fundamentalists. ‘We knew that Salman was supporting all of the causes,’ the official told me.” By July 1996 or soon after, US intelligence “had more than enough raw intelligence to conclude… bin Laden [was] receiving money from prominent Saudis.” [HERSH, 2004, PP. 324, 329-330] One such alleged charity front linked to Salman is the Saudi High Commission in Bosnia (see 1996 and After). Prince Salman has long been the governor of Riyadh province. At the time, he is considered to be about fourth in line to be king of Saudi Arabia. His son Prince Ahmed bin Salman will later be accused of having connections with al-Qaeda leader Abu Zubaida (see Early April 2002). [PBS, 10/4/2004] </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the allegations of links between the Saudi government and the 9/11 hijackers revolve around two enigmatic Saudi men who lived in San Diego: Omar al-Bayoumi and Osama Basnan, both of whom have long since left the United States.</p>

<p>In early 2000, al-Bayoumi, who had previously worked for the Saudi government in civil aviation (a part of the Saudi defense department), invited two of the hijackers, Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, to San Diego from Los Angeles. He told authorities he met the two men by chance when he sat next to them at a restaurant.</p>

<p>Newsweek reported in 2002 that al-Bayoumi’s invitation was extended on the same day that he visited the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles for a private meeting.</p>

<p>Al-Bayoumi arranged for the two future hijackers to live in an apartment and paid $1,500 to cover their first two months of rent. Al-Bayoumi was briefly interviewed in Britain but was never brought back to the United States for questioning.</p>

<p>As for Basnan, Newsweek reported that he received monthly checks for several years totaling as much as $73,000 from the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar, and his wife, Princess Haifa Faisal. Although the checks were sent to pay for thyroid surgery for Basnan’s wife, Majeda Dweikat, Dweikat signed many of the checks over to al-Bayoumi’s wife, Manal Bajadr. This money allegedly made its way into the hands of hijackers, according to the 9/11 report.</p>

<p>Despite all this, Basnan was ultimately allowed to return to Saudi Arabia, and Dweikat was deported to Jordan.</p>

<p>Sources and numerous press reports also suggest that the 28 pages include more information about Abdussattar Shaikh, an FBI asset in San Diego who Newsweek reported was friends with al-Bayoumi and invited two of the San Diego-based hijackers to live in his house.</p>

<p>Shaikh was not allowed by the FBI or the Bush administration to testify before the 9/11 Commission or the JICI.</p>

<p>Graham notes that there was a significant 9/11 investigation in Sarasota, Fla., which also suggests a connection between the hijackers and the Saudi government that most Americans don’t know about.</p>

<p>The investigation, which occurred in 2002, focused on Saudi millionaire Abdulaziz al-Hijji and his wife, Anoud, whose upscale home was owned by Anoud al-Hijji’s father, Esam Ghazzawi, an adviser to Prince Fahd bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, the nephew of Saudi King Fahd.</p>

<p>The al-Hijji family reportedly moved out of their Sarasota house and left the country abruptly in the weeks before 9/11, leaving behind three luxury cars and personal belongings including clothing, furniture and fresh food. They also left the swimming-pool water circulating.</p>

<p>Numerous news reports in Florida have said that the gated community’s visitor logs and photos of license tags showed that vehicles driven by several of the future 9/11 hijackers had visited the al-Hijji home. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Florida</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just two weeks before the 9/11 hijackers slammed into the Pentagon and World Trade Center, members of a Saudi family abruptly left their luxury home near Sarasota, leaving a brand new car in the driveway, a refrigerator full of food, fruit on the counter — and an open safe in the master bedroom.</p>

<p>In the weeks to follow, law enforcement agents not only discovered the home was visited by vehicles used by the hijackers, but phone calls were linked between the home and those who carried out the death flights — including leader Mohamed Atta — in discoveries never before revealed to the public.</p>

<p>Ten years after the deadliest attack of terrorism on U.S. soil, new information has emerged that shows the FBI found troubling ties between the hijackers and residents in the upscale community in southwest Florida, but the investigation wasn’t reported to Congress or mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

<p>To me, anything that is crafted that mentions Hijackers is backing up and supporting the official government conspiracy theory and propagating a myth. I see it as a deflection away from the truth and disinformation in the first degree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The claim that no Arab names appeared on the flight manifests for the planes hijacked on the morning of September 11, 2001 arose shortly after the terrorist attacks, and variations on the theme have persisted to this day. The claim initially arose when lists of passengers published by CNN, The Guardian, and the Associated Press contained no names of hijack suspects.</p>

<p>But to draw the conclusion from this that therefore no Arab names were on the manifest was a clear example of misinformation, as these lists were clearly reported as lists of victims, and partial lists at that. Furthermore, none of those lists were sourced to the manifests themselves. The Associated Press, for instance, noted that its lists were compiled not from any of the manifests, but from information obtained from “family members, friends, co-workers and law enforcement.”</p>

<p>The only list sourced to an actual manifest was from a graphic created by the staff of the Boston Globe that showed a complete list of names and seating locations for passengers on American Airlines Flight 11. That list did indeed include the names of the suspected hijackers, although it is not clear whether the Globe obtained the information independently from the airline or from investigators.</p>

<p>That said, the hijackers were real and they had connections to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Involvememt, not responsibility. </p>

<p>Obviously, the Saudi&#39;s were very well connected to the Bush Administration and there are so many connections, that my post focuses solely on the Saudis.The Saudi/US government argument is a complex and complete different post all on its own. There is simply to much information and material to cover in that regard.</p>

<p>I wanted to focus on just Saudi Arabia simply because there is so much evidence which points to their complicity and involvement and this is my attempt to help those unaware, to become more informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me, I&#39;m conspiracy-agnostic. Unless there&#39;s good reason to think otherwise, there is no conspiracy. I don&#39;t automatically assume everything I&#39;m told by the government is a lie.</p>

<p>I&#39;m told that an Islamic terrorist organization that originates in Saudi Arabia is responsible for this operation. Everyone seems to agree on this. This in itself is not evidence that it&#39;s a lie. I have no way of knowing if it&#39;s true or false - just the knowledge that telling lies is an incredibly dangerous thing to do if you get caught. Thousands of people are in the business of US national security, are they all lying to me? It&#39;s not out of the question, but it&#39;s also not <em>likely</em>. Certainly not enough to automatically label everything they say as a lie.</p>

<p>To the matter at hand - I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all to find out that Islamic terrorism, in particular Bin Laden&#39;s organization, used to be funded by Muslim oil barons, some of whom live in Saudi Arabia. It&#39;s not exactly a well-kept secret. There are probably behind-the-scenes moves made by the US, that you won&#39;t read about in the news, because they&#39;re a state secret. This is all probably true. I don&#39;t believe that the Saudi government is directly involved, although that is of course a possibility. If they were involved, I must say I think the US dealt with them expertly.</p>

<p>What evidence supports the hijackers being real?  Real meaning on the planes that allegedly flew into the Pentagon, Johnstown, and the Two Towers, not simply real people.  There really are only three things supporting the idea that there were hijackers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Before the flight, a few of them were allegedly caught on camera passing through an airport, but there is no time-stamp, and most security cameras that would have caught them weren&#39;t to be found.
-During the flight, they were apparently heard over the mic system, and passengers apparently detailed what was occurring via phone calls, some exceeding 20 minutes.  There are tons of impossibilities with this, many of which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdP95oSoOFk">Rebekah Roth</a> details here.
-After the flight, the hijackers passports were allegedly found on the ground next to the WTC.  I don&#39;t think I need to expand on this...</li>

The Atlantic sparkled bright blue in the crisp clear light of an early autumn New England morning, the short flight to Boston&#39;s Logan International was uneventful. Using their New Jersey drivers licenses as identification, they bought two one-way tickets on a visa card and checked in for American Airlines Flight 11 to Los Angeles .

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we are.  Because why would those about to <em>commit suicide</em> hide their faces for the only grainy, shitty footage the government releases?  We all know full well that much security footage supposedly exists, clear facial photos, but wasn&#39;t released.  I&#39;m going to go on believing it was due to them being patsies at most, or entirely fictitious from the outset.  It&#39;s a convenient method, very easily done by those in power to send us to never-ending war(s) on &quot;terror&quot;.</p>

<p>People asked for the images and they got them, they were listed on the flights, they were training in the flight schools, they were making calls that were intercepted, they were living in the US, they were getting money from Saudi Arabia, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be okay with the footage shown, even though it looks to have been taken with a banana.  Yeah, it wasn&#39;t HD, but it still isn&#39;t acceptable proof of anything.  It&#39;s quite telling that there isn&#39;t more, after all this was &quot;security&quot; for more than one airport.  There were something like 85 known cameras on the pentagon, yet they only released a few frames from <em>one</em> camera of the &quot;plane&quot; that hit it.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re convinced by the official version?  What&#39;s your opinion in a nutshell?</p>

<p>Hell no I&#39;m not convinced by the official version!</p>

<p>There are so many instances that don&#39;t make sense it&#39;s not even possible to go into.</p>

<p>My opinion in a nutshell is that Saudi Arabian and Pakistani intelligence pulled off the largest terrorist attack in history. The United States either let it happen, or they were &quot;taken by surprise,&quot; or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Once the investigations started, they began to cover up and suppress information to hide their incompetence.</p>

<p>why don&#39;t you discuss how the Bin Laden family and friends were <em>flown</em> out of the US in the next day <em>when ALL flights had been grounded</em>? i find that far more damning</p>

<p>If you will read my post, I have not blamed the Saudis. I have simply stated that they are heavily involved and I have provided an ample amount of evidence to support this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why now? it&#39;s a loong time past and there are more relevant issues to address ... although TBH I think &#39;the point of no return&#39; has already been passed and it&#39;s going to take some unprecedented shit to change the current course of world events, like &quot;Disclosure&quot;</p>

<p>IF people don&#39;t believe the truth, Why not try and help teach these people about how <em>competently</em> and <em>successfully</em> TPTB have been in keeping secrets for decades now, through using the &#39;need to know&#39; concept of compartmentalization of information. Starting with 140,000 people during the Manhattan Project?</p>

<p>First teach them &quot;how the govt does it&quot; <em>and then</em> &quot;apply it to 911&quot; ... the sau&#39;di&#39;s are a red herring, as are the &#39;dancing Israelis etc. Surley you can see that?</p>

<p>idk but maybe you&#39;d have more success changing people&#39;s mistaken beliefs by utilizing an already accepted event, i.e. the manhattan project or maybe discussing the things said by some very highly placed people <em>just before they died</em> (of old age) i.e. the head of Skunkworks and what he &#39;alluded&#39; to ... after all he <em>stated</em> in 1991 &quot;ladies and gentlemen, <strong>we HAVE the technology to TAKE ET HOME!</strong></p>

<p>that didn&#39;t get much press  ....  25 YEARS ago, The Head of &quot;Black Projects&quot; at Raytheon says &quot;we NOW CAN take ET <em>home</em>!&quot; and nobody says shit?</p>

<p>Or, &quot;whatever happened to those trillions mentioned in congress that were &#39;missing&#39; from the military, on 10/9/01 and <em>were to be</em> investigated ... BUT then 9/11 happened and it was never mentioned again?</p>

<p>The American (and most) people live with a mindset of &quot;if it&#39;s not MY problem, I <em>don&#39;t care</em>, so long as it&#39;s NIMBY&quot; .... BUT IT IS &quot;in their/your/my backyards&quot;
so how about we learn to &quot;call it as it is&quot; instead of <em>alluding to</em> blame other countries for their part in a Global scheme <em>solely orchestrated</em> by the US MIC as was forewarned by Eisenhower in his (unprecedented) retirement speech?</p>

<p>Teach the people this shit&#39;s been going on for FAR longer than 20-30yrs, and <em>maybe</em> they will make the connections as we have.</p>

<p>I for one have been familiar with the history of these events since the 80&#39;s, unlike most, for TPTB have successfully used the MSM as their propaganda machine -- until the Internet stuffed up that scam.</p>

<p>I thought 911 was a false flag event <em>as soon as i heard about it</em> on the radio. i had NO doubts <em>at all</em></p>

<p>What I didn&#39;t hear about was WTC7 until years later (watching Loose Change in fact) which was THE &quot;smoking gun&quot; ... alas, &quot;you can lead a dumbass to information BUT you can&#39;t make them understand it!&quot;</p>

<p>sigh ....</p>

<p>i just don&#39;t see the value in trying to bring the Saudi&#39;s into the picture, it just &#39;muddys the waters&#39; IMO</p>

<p>nonetheless, I appreciate your efforts .... but i think you&#39;ve put in too much info and it becomes confusing to the <em>casual</em> reader, (hopefully wanting to learn) and you sure don&#39;t need to convince the likes of me.</p>

<p>The 9/11 commission looked into the claims <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/Commission-report-on-bin-Laden-flights.pdf">and concluded</a>: &quot;we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13, 2001. To the contrary, every flight we have identified occurred after national airspace reopened.&quot;</p>

<p>So, unless you have evidence to demonstrate otherwise, this is a groundless claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly I remember it being discussed on the news</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Thousands Were Stranded, bin Ladens Flew</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Members of bin Laden&#39;s family and other important Saudis were &quot;driven or flown under FBI supervision to a secret assembly point in Texas and then to Washington from where they left the country on a private charter plane when airports reopened three days after the attacks.&quot; <strong>The flights to Texas and Washington occurred before the national air ban was lifted.</strong>   On September 13th a Lear Jet flew a Saudi Arabian prince, the son of the Saudi defense minister Prince Sultan and a Saudi army commander from Tampa, FL to Lexington, KY. Then the two flew on a private 747 out of the country</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/post911/aviation/binladin.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/post911/aviation/binladin.html</a></p>

<p>AND it was Sau&#39;di&#39;s as well. You missed that bit!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In March of 2005 more details about the Saudi flights surfaced as a result of a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department. Although the heavily redacted FBI documents apparently do not directly contradict the carefully worded denials of the Commission Report, <strong>they reveal the existence of previously undisclosed flights</strong>, and <strong>that the FBI provided escorts for some of the departing Saudis</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>fuck, it was even on CNN!</p>

<ul>
<li>Members of Osama bin Laden&#39;s family were allowed to fly out of the US shortly after the September 11 terror attacks, a senior official has said.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Even though American airspace had been shut down</strong>, the Bush administration allowed a jet to fly around the US picking up family members from 10 cities, including Los Angeles, Washington DC, Boston and Houston.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Some 140 high ranking Saudi officials were also on the plane.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, this is exactly why it does not mention anything about Israel, Urban Moving Systems, art students, Amdocs, Pakistan, $100,000, ISI, etc.</p>

<p>Correct.  Ever wonder why there is so little information on the Israelis&#39; involvement?  Or ever wonder who made the Saudi information so readily available?  </p>

<p>Because it simply isn&#39;t there. I&#39;ve read Christopher Bollyn&#39;s book. There are a handful of people and circumstances that yes, they are strange (I mentioned a few above), but other than those few examples, it really doesn&#39;t go any further.</p>

<p>If you want to get into dual citizens in US government and the Israeli lobby, that&#39;s another post for another topic. </p>

<p>Which, if you are interested in it, I would encourage you to research and present for us as I have done with Saudi Arabia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of that is reaching, and it get&#39;s into the dual citizenship scenarios that I was talking about above, along with some of the other examples I posted about before that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the items found at Sarajevo premises the Saudi High Commission when it was raided by NATO forces in September 2001[1] were before-and-after photographs of the World Trade Center, US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the USS Cole; maps of government buildings in Washington; materials for forging US State Department badges; files on the use of crop duster aircraft; and anti-Semitic and anti-American material geared toward children. Among six Algerians who would later be incarcerated at the Camp X-Ray detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba for plotting an attack on the US embassy in Sarajevo were two employees of the Commission, including a cell member who was in telephone contact with Osama bin Laden aid and al Qaeda operational commander Abu Zubayda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did Israel set this up? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the weeks to follow, law enforcement agents not only discovered the home was visited by vehicles used by the hijackers, but phone calls were linked between the home and those who carried out the death flights — including leader Mohamed Atta — in discoveries never before revealed to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did Israel set that up?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Again, there are interesting aspects to Israeli involvement, they had prior knowledge, their front company, Urban Moving Systems, was there watching as the planes hit. That does not mean that they orchestrated the entire thing. Just that they knew about an attack.</p>

<p>This appears to be pure, unadulterated, unsourced and unverified bullshit.

And I have seen absolutely no credible source i.e. not a blog to show they &quot;ran security&quot; at Dulles and Newark, as claimed. Have one showing it <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/12/inv.airport.security/">appears to be a totally different company</a>, Argenbright Security Inc. of whom it was said in 2001:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Argenbright is responsible for security at Philadelphia&#39;s airport and airports nationwide including Newark, Logan, O&#39;Hare, and Dulles. </p>

<p>Similarly, claims that Kroll Associates &quot;ran WTC security&quot; are equally unsourced - besides, I&#39;ve been repeatedly assured, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3p7wvt/guess_whos_brothers_company_maintained_security/">in this very forum</a>, it was Marvin Bush&#39;s Stratesec.</p>

<p>Similarly, claims that Kroll Associates &quot;ran WTC security&quot; are equally unsourced - besides, I&#39;ve been repeatedly assured, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3p7wvt/guess_whos_brothers_company_maintained_security/">in this very forum</a>, it was Marvin Bush&#39;s Stratesec.</p>

<p>So, any other made-up claims and false evidence you want to discuss?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;extremely friendly&#39; is a stretch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the relationship remains tense. Saudi Arabia is still the world’s leading oil exporter, but knows that its leverage is not what it was. There is a global glut of oil, and many countries are expanding production, including America itself. The Saudis also fear that if Iran manages to rehabilitate its status, after enduring 35 years of American hostility, it will cost their kingdom its place as the region’s prime economic and political player. By intervening in Yemen this summer, the Saudis have shown a willingness to fight in defence of their position.</p>

<p>the &#39;saudi 9/11&#39; narrative is necessary for the us/israel to even have the option of invading saudi arabia -- whether they go ahead with that option.. i dunno</p>

<p>This post represents an excellent effort from a long time member to compile a treasure trove of topic specific information that exclusively deals with the possibility of Saudi Arabian involvement in the attacks of 9-11.</p>

<p>This is something that has been discussed a lot recently in this subreddit because of the 28 pages of the intelligence report that haven&#39;t been released yet and presidential candidate Donald Trump&#39;s referencing those 28 pages as well as the  Saudis, specifically, on national TV.</p>

<p>This subject has rightly captured the attention of a lot of people and I think you&#39;re over stepping your boundaries by acting like it&#39;s some sort of personal affront against you.</p>

<p>This is exactly the kind of behavior people are talking about when they say Ae911 mobs are overly aggressive and often derail any conversation that falls outside of ae911s territory on 9-11.</p>

<p>Think about it: U.S. intelligence knew that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. Analysts also knew that Saudi money was a major force behind Al Qaeda. And, of course, Osama bin Laden, the perpetrator of the worst crime on American soil, was Saudi.</p>

<p>It is standard practice in murder investigations to interview friends and relatives of the primary suspect. One of the highest U.S. security priorities should have been the interrogation of Bin Laden&#39;s relatives and other Saudis who, inadvertently or not, may have funded him.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly it would be my expectation that they would do that,&quot; says Oliver &quot;Buck&quot; Revell, former associate deputy director of the FBI. And it should not have been difficult. U.S. airspace was almost entirely locked down. Virtually no one could fly. Nevertheless, the Saudi Arabian Embassy was able to organize a massive operation to evacuate these citizens from the U.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that&#39;s all well and good, but Osama Bin Laden had <em>no part</em> in 9/11. If he wasn&#39;t already dead from kidney failure on 9/11, he was certainly dead by the end of 2001. He was used as a pawn precisely because he was terminally ill. Any version of 9/11 involving OBL is a complete fabrication, a fairy tale. It&#39;s a testament to the power of propaganda that even this community, the conspiracy community, a group of people who are dedicated to exposing the 9/11 fraud, continue to perpetuate and disseminate the most basic of disinformation. Again, I say, <strong>Osama Bin Laden had no involvement in 9/11</strong>. Any attempt to &#39;expose&#39; 9/11 perpetrators by connecting them to OBL, even if well-intentioned (as in, not deliberate disinformation), is automatically wrong as it&#39;s based on a false premise.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they? They could have simply worked with the US to carry out the attack to further intervention in the Middle East.

<p>I want to agree with you, but I just can&#39;t.  People are dumb.  They&#39;ll believe whatever the hell &quot;the tube&quot; tells them to believe.  Donald Trump brings up &quot;Dancing Muslims&quot; on 9/11 and not one person stretches the debate to &quot;Dancing Israelis&quot;, rather they argue over the validity of the &quot;Dancing Muslims&quot; comment.</p>

<p>I just fear that we&#39;ll reach that tipping point - the point where 9/11 Truth is about to break into the mainstream - and Congress will declassify the &quot;28 Redacted Pages&quot; showing it to be a Saudi operation.  People will eat that up and look no further.  As Bob Kerrey famously said, &quot;9/11 was a 30-year conspiracy&quot;.  &quot;The 28 Pages&quot; are a part of this, the gatekeeper for when that tipping point is reached.</p>

<p><a href="https://kendoc911.wordpress.com/911-commission/28-redacted-pages/">This word doc</a> puts it perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The “28 Redacted Pages” will not lead to justice for 9/11 as the Saudi Connection does not answer the important questions about 9/11. The “28 Redacted Pages” is nothing more than a Red Herring created by the same people that helped orchestrate and cover up the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia is being scapegoated.</p>

<p>Just a few questions a Saudi Conspiracy cannot explain.
Did Saudi bring down Building 7 demolition style?
Did Saudi make NORAD stand down for nearly 90 Minutes?
Did Saudi put the Nano Thermite in the buildings?
Did Saudi plant the hijackers passport at Ground Zero?
Did Saudi make the plane disappear in the ground in Shanksville?
Did Saudi help NIST cover up all the evidence?
Did Saudi produce the molten steel in the rubble?
Did Saudi request a “New Pearl Harbor”?
Did Saudi admit that the Commission was setup to fail?
Did Saudi confiscate the 85 tapes from the Pentagon?
Did Saudi steal the missing $2.3 Trillion?
Did Saudi control the security at the WTC?</p>

<p>The easy answer to all of these questions is NO.</p>

<p>9/11 was a PNAC, MIC, PNAC, NEOCON, CIA, FBI, ISI AND MOSSAD JOB.</p>

<p>SAUDI SUPPLIED THE PATSY HIJACKERS!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>ADD:  Again I think this is an excellent post, but comes off as misleading to someone who may be visiting the page for the first time.  If we&#39;re going to sticky this, why don&#39;t we, together as a sub, construct a &quot;Draft of Israeli Involvement with 911&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>As I stated, my theory is that we the people are reaching the tipping point where &quot;9/11 Truth&quot; is seeping into the mainstream.  To counter this, the 28 Pages limited hangout is being pushed in the mainstream.</p>

<p>You make a good point though, why would the Saudi&#39;s just accept this?  It&#39;s hard to say, I just know that it&#39;s all one massive mindfuck!</p>

<p>If you watch threads regarding 9/11 on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> you&#39;ll notice a small group of users will all come out of the woodwork and act very aggressive towards anyone who does not advance their narrative.</p>

<p>In particular, they engage in tmor-style harassment of AMA guests who are not in their circles or chose to focus their research on other topics.</p>

<p>As of late, however, we have been most concerned with rampant vote manipulation in regards to submissions/comments regarding 9/11 (in particular this very post, which received 14 downvotes in 45 minutes); and if there is a group organizing via private subreddits in order to use 9/11 as a limited hangout to advance their monetary interests, we will find out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bob Graham is a <a href="http://digwithin.net/2015/05/12/bob-graham/"><strong>very dirty source</strong></a> for any quotes or facts about 9/11 or the &quot;28 pages.&quot;  Kevin Ryan&#39;s essay (linked) is fairly damning.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://digwithin.net/2014/03/16/28-missing-pages/">unreported facts around the &quot;Missing 28 Pages&quot;</a> suggest much staging:  Graham/Goss had conflicts of interest in leading the Joint Committee because they were from Florida where the alleged hijackers trained; Cheney made it clear that he would participate only if Graham/Goss were in charge of the committee; Graham/Goss obstructed witnesses, withheld information, and manipulated events surrounding the Inquiry &amp; its relations with the FBI.</p>

<p>Graham&#39;s &amp; Goss&#39; involvement with 9/11 runs <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091101mahmoodmeeting#a091101mahmoodmeeting">much deeper</a>.  At minimum, their conflict-of-interest is so huge that they cannot be counted as trusted sources for any information.</p>

<p>How much of the 28 pages is a designated failsafe; not merely a limited hangout (since it reportedly points fingers at Saudi Arabia, but not Pakistan or UAE or many other states) but a trap?  Could the 28 pages be used as a honeypot to jump-start &amp; control an HSCA-style &quot;re-investigation&quot; into 9/11 not only as a &quot;centerpiece misdirect&quot; but as a momentum-killer for other spectacular leads?  Why wouldn&#39;t we anticipate that HSCA would be on the minds of &quot;inside job&quot; participants as an example to be learned from, as well as possibly an opportunity, in controlling a seemingly-inevitable &quot;opposition party&quot; re-investigation?</p>

<p>While I agree that not everything surrounding Graham is ideal, he did read the 28 redacted pages and has stated that a cover-up had been attempted by the White House. </p>

<p>Because he read the pages, I believe him to be a credible source. It&#39;s certainly much more information that either of us have access to reading. </p>

<p>I also agree with you that Pakistan was involved with the operation and I thought about including the general and the $100,000 wire transfer as well as Saeed Sheik who kidnapped Daniel Pearl who himself let Zacarias Moussaoui order tickets from him laptop in Oklahoma. </p>

<p>But I decided to keep to focus on the Saudi for this post. There are just too many angles, situations, and circumstances to have an entire overview. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Graham didn&#39;t &quot;read&quot; the pages, he oversaw &amp; controlled their production.  He was head of the Joint Committee.</p>

<p>We need to take Graham&#39;s background into account, since there are Red Flags everywhere:</p>

<p><a href="http://digwithin.net/2015/05/12/bob-graham/">http://digwithin.net/2015/05/12/bob-graham/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Graham never calls for release of other documents collected by the government’s 9/11 investigators, most of which are still held secret</p>

<p>Graham shows no interest in the many alarming facts about 9/11 that have been uncovered through released documents and videos. Some things that have been released via FOIA request are far more compelling than claims of Saudi financing</p>

<p>Few people seem to remember that Bob Graham was against an investigation from the start. In November 2001, two months after 9/11, Graham was leading the effort to delay any inquiry into the crimes.</p>

<p>Although Graham now claims that the Bush Administration covered-up Saudi involvement in 9/11, he and Goss, who had an interesting history together, led an inquiry that covered-up 9/11 in nearly every other sense.</p>

<p>Due to an alleged leak, Graham and Goss even initiated an FBI investigation of their own panel members while the panel was investigating the FBI. </p>

<p>Another unnoticed fact is that Graham’s calls for release of the 28 pages have matched up, chronologically, with changes in Saudi government leadership. That is, the times when Graham has made noise about the 28 pages have run parallel to the times of uncertainty with regard to the succession of the Saudi monarchy or Saudi strategic partnerships. This suggests that Graham is simply using the redacted section of his report as a control mechanism to bring new Saudi leadership in line with continued U.S. interests.</p>

<p>Although Graham joined others to call for release of the 28 pages in July 2003, perhaps in an attempt to pressure Saudi Arabia to fully support the War on Terror (which it did soon after), he did not continue that effort. In fact, Graham appeared to ignore the issue for the next seven years. In November 2010, the illness of King Abdullah began to stir fears over the succession to the Saudi throne. Just a few months later, Graham released a novel that hinted at unresolved questions about Saudi involvement in 9/11.</p>

<p>In late 2013, the Saudi government announced that King Abdullah was very ill and, in late 2014, his death was said to be imminent. At the same time, the Saudis began forging a new strategic relationship with China, leaving people to wonder if the U.S. was “losing Saudi Arabia to China.” That was when Graham really turned up the heat. He joined a coalition of U.S. congressmen who began resurrecting the issue of the 28 pages with gusto and they began to get a lot of attention from the mainstream media.</p>

<p>The demise of Abdullah ignited conflict among factions within the Saudi power structure. The Saudi king died in late January 2015 and Graham’s new calls for release of the redacted section became increasingly well covered as the new king, Salman, took office. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the start, <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/234848">even the Saudis were calling for the 28 pages to be released.</a></p>

<p>The 28 pages is misdirection.  Look at Bob Graham&#39;s background.  Look at the Saudis call for the 28 pages to be released.</p>

<p>Could it be, just maybe, that Graham&#39;s effort isn&#39;t what it seems?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Graham and Richard Shelby have said that there is no reason for the pages to be censored. How could they take that stance without reading them?

<p>The reasoning for the Saudi&#39;s calling for declassification is because they know full well that it is not going to happen. They are just saving face and calling for declassification because it looks great for them to do so on the international stage. Again, they know that it isn&#39;t going to happen.</p>

<p>was an information operation of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) that was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke.[1] The goal of the operation is &quot;to spread the administrations&#39;s talking points on Iraq by briefing retired commanders for network and cable television appearances,&quot; where they have been presented as independent analysts;[2] Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Pentagon&#39;s intent is to keep the American people informed about the so-called War on Terrorism by providing prominent military analysts with factual information and frequent, direct access to key military officials.[3][4] The Times article suggests that the analysts had undisclosed financial conflicts of interest and were given special access as a reward for promoting the administration&#39;s point of view. </p>

<p>The Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld covert propaganda program was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke. The idea was to recruit &quot;key influentials&quot; to help sell a wary public on &quot;a possible Iraq invasion.&quot; Former NBC military analyst Kenneth Allard called the effort &quot;psyops on steroids.&quot; [1]

<p>It definitely was heavy propaganda, they had to sell the invasion of Iraq to the U.S. public.</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s the REAL conspiracy here. I genuinely don&#39;t think the American government staged or even knew in advance (to any meaningful degree - you can certainly argue they <em>should</em> have known) about 9/11. But they exploited the heck out of it, for a whole slab of unrelated causes, resulting in the deaths of far more American citizens than 9/11, and costing us trillions of dollars.</p>

<p>Quite why that isn&#39;t the focus of the 9/11 Truth movement escapes me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its pretty obvious that the accused hijackers and Osama were part of the psy op,   and that the actual events of 9/11 were not performed by the hijackers or Osama,  or any planning of Osama.</p>

<p>What is good about this post is that it exposes people who are confused,   and it also brings together people who have started to work out what really happened.</p>

<p>Look at the comments of people here like u/Orangutan, u/sheasie,  u/Greg_Roberts_0985 for links to the real clues.</p>

<p>On the other hand,   if you added in the US Consulate (in Saudi) visa process (in support of the psy op) and ties to Israel,   there is some good reference material here,   which helps to fill out the psy op.    There were Saudi players that were on board with the US invasion of Iraq,  etc.    In fact,   in Syria  this trajectory continues to unfold.</p>

<p>why bother?  If there were ANY Saudi involvement it would be under US &#39;guidance&#39;, so it&#39;s a moot point</p>

<p>why don&#39;t you discuss how the Bin Laden family and friends were <em>flown</em> out of the US in the next day <em>when ALL flights had been grounded</em>? i find that far more damning</p>
