<p><a href="https://xerq.io/threads/191844-Systemd-is-a-virus-and-a-prime-example-of-why-Linux-development-has-gotten-ugly">https://xerq.io/threads/191844-Systemd-is-a-virus-and-a-prime-example-of-why-Linux-development-has-gotten-ugly</a></p>

<p>&quot;systemd is attempting to remove the modular approach of UNIX design philosophy, and do everything itself. It originally started as a way to speed up boot time - a problem not really in need of solving with linux systems, as they boot rather infrequently as is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a crufty piece of shit with a pile of dependencies - consolekit and polkit, two of Lennart&#39;s other creations, plus a variety of other Kits, tools designed to be easy to use via an API, but difficult from the CLI. Consolekit spawns about 50 idle threads in my testing, doing absolutely nothing. Why?</p>

<p>Systemd is bloated. It tries to take over the function of two dozen other systems that already work. It takes log files and makes them BINARY! It is intended to be a syslog replacement. Why? If I want to use syslog for a variety of reasons, or so that I can interact with log files in a text format, I now have to install syslog and have systemd send it to the syslog. This works, of course, but I now have a redundant system taking resources for zero reason.</p>

<p>Systemd is a virus, and it&#39;s fucking up Linux for those of us who work with it on a daily basis. The reason, as best I can tell, is wanting to compete with Windows and OSX by making the system more like them - rather than better than them.</p>

<p>There is nothing systemd does that couldn&#39;t be done with existing tools or with new ones written to work on top of existing tools, allowing everyone else freedom of choice on whether or not they even want the shit installed and in use.</p>

<p>The problem is that Lennart&#39;s paradigm is one that suits companies like Red Hat, and as Red Hat goes, so does much of everyone else. The dozens of red hat based distributions will soon be on systemd. Arch has moved over. Others are following because systemd has merged in udev, and as everyone uses udev, and it is now nearly fucking impossible to separate the two without serious work, they&#39;re shrugging their shoulders and falling in.</p>

<p>Debian and Ubuntu will likely follow, eventually. Gentoo will have it as an option, but they&#39;ve already confirmed that long term they&#39;re committed to OpenRC being their default. Slackware probably won&#39;t, because they&#39;re weird enough in just the right way systemd probably doesn&#39;t appeal. For everyone else? Meet the new face of mainstream Linux development - the abandonment of Unix principles for the Microsoft and Apple way.</p>

<p>At least the MS and Apple way makes sense for them - they are the only companies developing their OS. Who gives a shit if everything is tied together? It was always them writing it to begin with. But Linux has always been about collaboration - there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s the whole naming controversy about GNU/Linux and Linux exists to begin with - GNU wrote the userland, Linus wrote the kernel, and combined they made the OS known today.</p>

<p>Migrate to BSD, boys and girls. Or Illumos. Or if you&#39;re sticking to Linux, you&#39;ve basically got Slackware as your only option, unless you&#39;re one of those weirdos who wants to spend 3 days compiling your OS whenever you install it, in which case there&#39;s Gentoo. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no issue with systemd, because I have full access to its source code and can modify it however I want. If you don&#39;t want to use systemd, use <a href="https://devuan.org/">Devuan.</a></p>

<p>Prior to using systemd, I had no intuitive way to do socket-activated services. I was using conflicting tooling for timers and system events - now I can just write systemd timers. I used to have to look at man pages to find the log of an individual application, now most of them use journald. If I want to pipe journald into a log file, I can. Turning on and off services has never been easier, and systemd is complete enough to also be a viable replacement for systems like kded that tried to provide a user session daemon which was always desktop-specific - now systemctl --user lets me do that from my own desktop, enabling services like redshift just like I would enable a samba server.</p>

<p>I recognize the issue with everything being under the systemd brand - but if systemd goes against my interests, I can fork it. It is nothing like the proprietary disasters this thread is about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Example #58382 there&#39;s trolls on this subreddit.  What you said is not only completely valid, but true.  And besides, being on an OS like Linux exposes you to far fewer viruses and things like that.  With as large of a marketshare that MS OS&#39;s have, its far more efficient for hackers/hacker groups to target these groups of computers, because of the sheer volume of users.</p>

<p>Distro&#39;s such as Mint are already quite user friendly and offer an easy transition to Linux, but I think in order to see larger change, these groups putting these distros out must market them better- what&#39;s in it for me (the user), why should I change, why is this safer, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a windows box to occasionally use AutoCAD, to play GTAV and to run the odd tool that doesn&#39;t work anywhere else, like updating my GPS.</p>

<p>You really do need a windows box for some things, but these are the only things I use Windows for.</p>

<p>Face it, a security letter to Microsoft is the only thing between privacy and the government getting total control of your computer.  And that&#39;s just the government.  The odds that that letter has never been sent are pretty close to zero in my opinion.</p>

<p>Linux is a bit of a conundrum.  It wasn&#39;t meant to be an operating system for the people, it is designed to be an IT/programmer toolkit and in that regard it is very successful.</p>

<p>I do have a friend who is a computer journalist who has mint up and running on a (ex) Chromebook and he&#39;s quite happy with it.  Ubuntu is targeting the general user, and I have to say they are making Linux more like windows and less like the tool Linux was designed to be, so I hate it, too many things have changed, but my 79 year old mother uses it and I never have to sweep it for viruses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even sure thats true. Far-right nuts may trample the 4th just like far-left nuts trample the 2nd but that is mostly because they know what the can get away without alienating their constituency. A &quot;constitutionalist&quot; is right-wing but protects the 4th. Look at Paul. More than 2/3s of Democrats voted for the Patriot Act in the House and only one Senator, a Democrat, voted against it. I would like to add that people, especially &#39;Muricans are retarded and the media tends to point the camera at the dimmest lot. I really believe that most people pick a side and then try to fit.

<p>just like far-left nuts trample the 2nd</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Second Amendment states, &quot;A <strong>well-regulated militia</strong> being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, when this was written, the U.S. had no proper standing army, so an armed militia was <strong>necessary to the security of a free State</strong>.</p>

<p>What does &quot;well-regulated&quot; mean?  Well, the Founders further clarified that for us, which is great.  In <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">Article I, Section 8</a>, of the Constitution, the militia is <strong>called, armed, trained and disciplined by Congress</strong>. In Article II, Section 2, the militia is <strong>commanded by the president</strong>.</p>

<p>The Constitution gives Congress and the President the right to command and discipline those people who choose to bear arms.  It&#39;s all right there; you can read it just as the Founders intended. Anyone who states otherwise is lying to you to further their own agenda.</p>

<p>So when &quot;far-left nuts&quot; want to discipline and command the people who bear arms, please explain to me how they are &quot;trampling&quot; the Second Amendment, when it&#39;s right there in the Constitution that they have the absolute right to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ACTUALLY, the Supreme Court just recently, ~2008, ruled that the 2nd Amendment applies/protects individuals, separate from a militia.  Controversial ruling, led by the recently deceased Justice Scalia.  So your militia reasoning no longer applies.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller</a></p>

<p>TL:DR Version:</p>

<p>In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court undertook its first-ever &quot;in-depth examination&quot; of the second amendment&#39;s meaning Id. at 635. After a lengthy historical discussion, the Court ultimately concluded that the second amendment &quot;guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation&quot; (id. at 592); that &quot;central to&quot; this right is &quot;the inherent right of self-defense&quot;(id. at 628); that &quot;the home&quot; is &quot;where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute&quot; (id. at 628); and that, &quot;above all other interests,&quot; the second amendment elevates &quot;the right of law abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home&quot; (id. at 635). Based on this understanding, the Court held that a District of Columbia law banning handgun possession in the home violated the second amendment. Id. at 635.[45]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. I wondered the same, since I see Apple as one of the more despicable corporations out of the bunch. I don&#39;t believe Apple will ever do anything that isn&#39;t motivated by self interest. So, no.</p>

<p>I think their position is based on what&#39;s best for business, now and in the future. Apple is built on their closed system tech. It&#39;s what sets them apart and is one of the biggest reasons people buy their shit. If they made that master key, it would eventually get out. Once people know about it, Apple loses one of if not THE thing that makes them Apple. They&#39;d be just as vulnerable as everything else. I think that would hurt their bottom line immensely, maybe even be a death blow for the company. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s just convenient that their self interest lead them to the same decision as altruism would. It paints this in a more positive light for them than &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good business decision for us to make&quot;. But I could be wrong. It&#39;s just my opinion.</p>

<p>The fact that the shooter is dead, makes this a moot point.</p>

<p>The only valid legal reason for evidence at this point is for a conviction of a living defendant.  If the suspects are dead, then why the big deal about what may be on their phone? (BTW IMO, I don&#39;t think there is anything special on the phone)</p>

<p>This a PR stunt to marginalize and push ending encryption? As early as 2013 it was disclosed that the NSA has access to like every Iphone sold. So...WTF? Will the NSA not work with the FBI?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NSA Reportedly Has Total Access To The Apple iPhone</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/12/30/the-nsa-reportedly-has-total-access-to-your-iphone/#214c62d11604">http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/12/30/the-nsa-reportedly-has-total-access-to-your-iphone/#214c62d11604</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>NSA spyware gives agency full access to the iPhone -- report</p>

<p>Leaked documents shared by Der Spiegel show that a piece of NSA spyware called DROPOUTJEEP can access pretty much everything on the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/nsa-spyware-gives-agency-full-access-to-the-iphone-report/">http://www.cnet.com/news/nsa-spyware-gives-agency-full-access-to-the-iphone-report/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m calling bullshit on this PR stunt. This is just setting the precedent for corporations to backdoor every technology they sell to the public. Cook is well aware the Feds already have access to Iphones so WTF is going on?</p>

<p>Even in the case of the iPhone six. The FBI should have no problem getting the records from the data carrier.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Apple is pretending to put up some big fight when everyone knows they were one of the partners of PRISM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple was among the first companies accused of participating in the PRISM data mining project of the NSA, following the release by Snowden of the agency&#39;s classified documents. The project reportedly involved extracting video, audio, pictures, documents, emails and connection logs from devices, allowing analysts to track the movement of the device&#39;s user and the communications that they are receiving or sending out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck Apple and fuck yo iphones. Apple doesnt stand for privacy and they definitely aren&#39;t standing up against the FEDS. Anyone that believes they are is a complete sucker.</p>

<p>One of lying James Clappers famous quotes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is only for “foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States,” and “cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States.”</p>

<p>Cops Don’t Need a Crypto Backdoor to Get Into Your iPhone</p>

<li>To our knowledge Apple&#39;s OS doesn&#39;t have specific backdoors</li>
<li>Zerodays are not backdoors, they are security flaws.  Anyone can say after-the-fact that it was put in &#39;accidentally on purpose&#39;, but that&#39;s assuming way too much intelligence at the genius bar.</li>
<li>Apple makes a best-effort to audit new apps they add to their app store.  It&#39;s still possible for 3rd party apps to have exploitable security flaws that may or may not be backdoors (likely not, unless the software is exceedingly popular and very good--which means the developer should know better).</li>
<li>Others can access your iphone through apps on your phone.  Since you gave your app various permissions--for example to use the wifi, bluetooth, camera, mic--the app can be taken over and then have access to those features on your phone. Be more discerning on the apps you use and more stringent on permissions.</li>
<li>I&#39;m not defending apple.  I don&#39;t own their devices.  I don&#39;t trust them.  I dont&#39; think it&#39;s wise to trust them.  I think Apple is kind of a piece of crap (for unrelated reasons) just like the rest of the big companies on the internet--they are all untrustworthy.</li>

<p>To play devil&#39;s advocate, if Apple created a new OS for the govt that could be hacked, and it was leaked, they would have a class action suit on their hands.  The first time some nudes were leaked, or some banking data fell in the wrong hands.  </p>

<p>It makes fiscal sense to oppose backdoors.  So conspiracy aside, it&#39;s the smart business decision.  It&#39;s less about us or the government, and more about Apple&#39;s bottom line.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read much about the tech details of this Apple thing yet, but from a general technical standpoint, any backdoors purposefully built into a piece of software can and most likely will be exploited by bad actors (gov&#39;t and non-gov&#39;t), so gov&#39;t mandated backdoors would almost assuredly lead to a significant increase in cybercrime, which creates bad publicity and, in turn and most importantly, lost profits - that&#39;s their main concern.</p>

<p>Kudos to the Apple marketing department, though - they know their customers are more likely to care about these types of political issues, especially in an election year, and they are about to get tons of free publicity as privacy advocates by framing it like they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very suspicious of this.  I&#39;m actually confused about the headlines of apple refusing to decrypt the san bernardino shooters phone.  </p>

<p>How in the fuck if that&#39;s actually what is happening, does the government not have the ability to do it already?  What could apple do if the phone is encrypted?  </p>

<p>I simply don&#39;t believe that the device could be encrypted at a level that the government didn&#39;t have the resources to crack, but apple magically would.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Encryption takes a lot of time to crack, with some estimates taking years and thousands of tries. </p>

<p>What&#39;s going on in this case is that the shooter&#39;s iphone lockscreen only allows you ten times to guess the password wrong before it wipes the phone completely (this is included on all iPhones now). Seeing that there are thousands of combinations possible and only ten tries the FBI now wants Apple to build an OS update that will allow the government to circumvent this aspect of the phone&#39;s protection. So it&#39;s not that Apple has technology the FBI doesn&#39;t posses, it&#39;s that Apple is the only one now that could possibly find a way to allow the FBI access to the phone. </p>

<p>Or they use security exploits of javascript in safari.  Or they just read your email and google docs to find passwords you&#39;ve kept there and then try those out on your devices, which they can do in nanoseconds with a computer the size of a building like prism or tempora.  They do have all your gmail btw and can access it and read any part of it.</p>

<p><em>Because of &quot;AT&amp;T&#39;s extreme willingness to help&quot; they can also intercept ALL the data from your device, store it, and then hack against your semi-encrypted data stream.  They dont need to even be in your device.  In fact, they are so cowardly that they won&#39;t try to intrude on your device itself because they might get caught and it could become a legal issue.  Instead, they cast a wide net. This includes making a fun, free game like angry birds and have you install it so that your device can spy on you automatically, by sending puzzling &#39;diagnostic data&#39; back to servers in seychelles while you sleep, after it has turned itself back on</em></p>
