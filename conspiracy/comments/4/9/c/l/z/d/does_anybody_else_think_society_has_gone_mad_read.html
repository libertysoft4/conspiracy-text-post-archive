        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m relatively young, but I feel like I experienced a shift in society (or I have just become more aware of it as I&#39;ve gotten older).</p>

<p>As I&#39;m getting ready for work, I have a little free time to reflect. I was thinking that nearly everybody is addicted to something now.</p>

<p>Nobody can cope with reality, so everybody has an addiction to choose from. Food? Drugs? Alcohol? Sex? Entertainment? Power? Work? </p>

<p>You get the point. But I mean people are actually addicted, and they will justify their behaviors because is what society says is okay.</p>

<p>I recently had a panic attack, and I realized it was because I was overworking myself, but in our society that is celebrated. Overeat. Overwork. Overindulge.</p>

<p>This is a mad society. There is absolutely no balance, and people have no measure of balance anymore. How do we measure normalcy is an insane world?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think there are &quot;good old days.&quot; I think this trend has been going on for a while, and it is reaching its peak now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not judging anybody, and I struggle with my own issues just as anybody else does. But society now says, &quot;Do whatever makes you superficially happy because that&#39;s all that matters!&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps this is all obvious to you all, but it just hit me really hard.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Commentary?</p>

<p>Edit: I have been reading your responses all day, and I love them. Gives me some faith and hope.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t expect this to get any attention at all :)</p>

<p>Edit 2: I have loved reading every single reply and have responded as much as possible. It isn&#39;t too late to join the discussion. Thanks for making this an interesting day.</p>

<p>Edit 3: wow. You guys are awesome. I replied as much as possible and up voted nearly every thought (even if I didn&#39;t agree).</p>

<p>I think what I&#39;m seeing is most of us are at a place we are not just accepting of the reality we see. I think that is a really good sign and I&#39;m thankful for all of your thoughts and comments. </p>

<p>On top of that, even if you didn&#39;t think your comment was noticed, a lot of people told me they kept checking again and again for new comments.</p>

<p>There was so much insight. There were so many great links shared. Nobody was hostile.</p>

<p>All I know is that I feel like there may be people living at a different level of consciousness, and we must be patient with the world around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Welcome to the grind.</em></p>

<p>To your tacit obedience of monotony,<br/>
strung along by the vestiges of a once great dream, now dead.<br/>
Lids open, yet sight unseen, you shamble through a<br/>
veritable wasteland deftly adorned with mind numbing distractions.</p>

<p><strong>You are in a desert, mirages surround you; 
your soul thirsts, your consciousness starves.</strong></p>

<p>You would know this, if only you could possess the tools to realize it.<br/>
Instead, something just feels wrong. A hollow emptiness.<br/>
Faced with fear of uncovering the truth, you return to monotony;<br/>
a near-life experience had just occurred, and faded.   </p>

<p><em>Welcome back to the grind.</em></p>

<p>Edit: Attempted to clean it up some. Formatting is a pain.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Thank you gracious stranger. You&#39;ve all given me some much needed confidence. Writing is what I love, but the will and the means just haven&#39;t been there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would love William S. Burroughs&#39; writings.<br/>
&#39;&#39;&quot;His late Red Night trilogy (Cities of the Red Night, 1981;  The Place of Dead Roads, 1983; and  The Western Lands, 1987) remains underrated, reminiscent almost of Borges in scope (the stories roam in space and time) and reflexivity towards literary history. Genres are spliced and turned inside out, elements of noir, sci-fi, smut, Westerns, pirate adventures, Egyptian mythology and fantasy quests are thrown together. There are worlds in those books. &#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>This is some great insight that is inspiring me enough to start looking into the tarot decks.   I thank you.   I&#39;m pretty well off in the astrology department,  vedic,  Chinese,  Western.   I&#39;ve got a good friend who endured kaballah for a year or two who has been trading their secrets with me.  He&#39;s also more advanced on the numerology part,  which I should also get more involved in.  Now,  with your heart information,  I will take it to the next level.  </p>

<p>Do you recommend any thing else or a point of direction for a complete beginner of the tarot system,  other than starting with the thoth deck?  Mind you,  I&#39;ve read and understood completely the emerald tablets, with some other decent backgrounds that I&#39;ve explained.   I would appreciate any information given by you.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s.. pretty much what I attempted to convey. You&#39;ve grasped it quite well. Realization in this context, of a life of aimless meandering, is painful. Terrifying, as you put it. An initiation of sorts, akin to a baptism of fire. </p>

<p>Not for the foolhardy, or even the fool alike. There&#39;s no return from the abyss, unless of course you are already in one. The Ouroboros becomes important here.</p>

<p>Edit: Best of luck in your struggles. I lost a good friend to an OD. </p>

It hurts deep inside, and you begin to resent everyone around you with friends.  Not a healthy outlook, but that&#39;s what society forces on you.  Accept and conform, or banish thyself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright then, Ma&#39;am it is.  :P  I&#39;m running a S4 and yes, I am ashamed about that.  Of course facebook wants everything, mark doucherbag made a deal with the establishment, supply data to them so they can easily  keep tabs on all of the citizens, they give him a boatload of money and a hot wife.  Lol.</p>

<p>As far as privacy goes, my S4 is a work phone, so I didn&#39;t really want to install anything or change any of the settings, but I do have Firefox with multiple security extensions (for example, uBlock Origin, NoScript, etc, etc.)  </p>

<p>I am waiting on the kinks to be fixed in all of the upcoming phones, as well as reviews by people detailing just how well the phone(s) hold up.  The G5 is what I&#39;m leaning towards, if only because of that amazing camera, and the DAC Module.  That battery life, though...  :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, since I&#39;m upgrading from a S4, I really want to see how mobile technology has come.  There&#39;s no such thing as too many bells and whistles, I need my phone to be everything in one device.  </p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said before, Nexus phones are great, but until one comes with a good DAC built in, I&#39;m not buying one.  Also, the lack of expandable storage is very unfortunate.  Sony hasn&#39;t officially announced it, but the Z flagship line is probably done for.  The new X series looks promising, though.</p>

<p>Chinese OEMs, for some reason, are the only companies putting big batteries into their phones.  I&#39;ve not seen the Mi4s, but the Mi5 looks like it could be a good phone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty, I&#39;m not interested in purchasing any Xiaomi devices at the moment-the specs are there, but I would rather go with a company with a proven track record, such as LG or Samsung.  In a couple of years, perhaps, but not yet.  Xiaomi hasn&#39;t even hit the States yet (though truthfully, that&#39;s probably due to our shitty carriers here).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/hp-elite-x3/">http://www.cnet.com/products/hp-elite-x3/</a>  If this ran Android, I&#39;d buy it in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately, HP is only interested in catering this device to the business market, so I doubt that one could even buy it otherwise.  The specs are fantastic, but then again, HP has been known to release new devices, only to abandon them shortly thereafter...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting my two cents in on video games. As someone that grew up adopted into horrible abusive parents, I was lucky enough to be able to play video games. They saved my life. Like, I&#39;m not even kidding. Yes, I did play COD and all that crap eventually for fun, but the things that ended up sticking with me were the things my parents should have taught me. Things the heroes and stories painted out on a canvas for us gamers. Final Fantasy (all of them. The core theme) and Kingdom Hearts stick out for me. Standpoints on different morals, politics, tolerance, open mindedness, just generally being a non-shithead. I still had friends, went out, etc, but when I got home.. I couldnmt deal with them. So I went and played video games. It was a source of happiness for me. Eventually they kicked me out for &quot;being a piece of shit.&quot; Which in reality they disliked my &quot;choice to be&quot; lesbian. Ahh, but now I&#39;m 21 and still enjoy gaming in my free time. Gaming can be a lifestyle too. (:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I should have said mobile games are the ones holding those eyes with the &quot;reward&quot; effect and causing 100% attention addiction.  When a currently reality is tough and you have no other means, then I can see where larger gaming provides that level of comfort and control in one&#39;s life.   Everyone needs to escape every now and then, even if it&#39;s just for a few hours to refresh and feel joy.  </p>

<p>I honestly dont know if I was addicted or not. I was about 15 and using morphine daily for like a month and a half.  I should have been. Ohhh, that was some fucked up shit. I may have just gotten horribly lucky. I cant do opoids. Even for things like dentistry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opiods are actually dark drugs. CNS depressants. Getting high by shutting your body off??? (Alcohol, I&#39;m looking at you!). I feel the only drugs worthwhile are psychedelics, LSD, mushrooms, DMT, Ibogaine, Mescaline. And the occasional MDMA experience 3 months minimum spaced apart. Drugs are an experienced, not a pivotal part of your life. And Heroin/Meth (Opiods/opiates and psychostimulants) are no good news. And cocaine basically isn&#39;t even a drug with all it&#39;s cuts. You&#39;re snorting or shooting something weird so it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. They try to contact me after they heard I didnt come crawling back to live with them. I&#39;ve talked to them a few times, but it always turns into a &quot;we tried our hardest, we did what we thought was right, we tried to help you.&quot; And I just get so pissed off hearing their.. fucking. .. It&#39;s literally like talking to one of those really annoying kids that thinks they know it all, and even even when proven wrong, they pull some stunt to get back at you. Mental fucking gymnastics, I swear to god. When an unstable adult does it, those &quot;stunts&quot; are trauma inducing. I decided I was just done at 15. I cant deal with it. I stopped letting it affect me badly other than just sheer anger at their inability to even try to be parents and not abusive assholes. They haven&#39;t changed, and wont. They&#39;re toxic and cannot be apart of my life if I want to be mentally stable and healthy.</p>

<p>So yeah. I was &quot;worse than Hitler&quot;, according to my mom, and going to hell. (: I say bring it! Ellen Degenerez will be there, Drag queens,  Kate McKinnon, shit. If it exists, count me in. Oh, Marijuana too! Since it&#39;s of the devil and what not. Sounds fun to mee</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey older fellow wanderer of life - I too found solace in music by becoming a songwriter at age 51 and joining forces with my family to play music as a band, Swamp-style Folk Music. Our first CD was published last Summer, shit yeah!</p>

<p>We don&#39;t care where our music takes us because we do it for the love of it, as cliche as that sounds.</p>

<p>If anyone wants a fun new addiction, try song writing, throw all your angst into it, it helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about technology. The basic tenet of Marxist theory is essentially that the structures a society can occupy (i.e. loosely &#39;Feudal&#39;, &#39;Primitive tribal&#39; etc.) is largely dictated by the technology available. Marx used the general umbrella term of &#39;Means of Production&#39; but I think in today&#39;s world of rapid advance we can quite easily see how even changes in information-transmission can radically alter how people interact with one another (the basis of all society!). </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t seen it already CGP Grey&#39;s video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">Technological Unemployment</a> is well worth watching as is Chris Martenson&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi7rSNdHDUY&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;list=PLRgTUN1zz_ofJoMx1rB6Z0EA1OwAGDRdR">Crash Course</a> series if you have a bit more time to spare.</p>

<p>My personal belief - We are a blessed generation. We get to grow up in the period that humanity itself starts to grow up. The Internet and other revolutions are allowing us to integrate technology <em>into ourselves</em> and in turn allowing us to interact with each other on a far more personal level than was conceivable even 50 years ago. We get to see the dawn of an age where all of the pre-existing assumptions about how humans can function are going to be turned completely upside down and I for one cannot fucking wait. </p>

Online social media and phones haven&#39;t brought us together, we are more awkward and detached in person than ever before. Even medical advances are used for profitable treatments versus cures. Tech advances haven&#39;t brought society security from terrorism, it&#39;s brought entrapment and control from governments.</p>

<p>Simply put, your optimistic view of society ignores how truly dark and selfish human nature is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you&#39;re right, but you seem overly optimistic about technology. </p>

<p>How do you square this with our alienation from nature? </p>

<p>To me, technology is an attempt to further separate us from nature.  When we increase this divide, I think it spells some pretty disastrous outcomes for humanity. </p>

<p>Just look at how often people say &quot;Technology will solve this!&quot; and it&#39;s usually a problem that was caused by technology. </p>

<p>Climate change is a great example. No large scale industrialization? No climate change.</p>

<p>How are we going to fix it? Mass production of renewable forms of energy. </p>

<p>While I&#39;d love to be completely in favor of technology&#39;s benefits, I wish there were more critical voices out there about its perils. </p>

<p>Technology I think can do good, but it must be owned by us, the people. We must be able to control its usage, and ultimately its hold on us. I think technology isn&#39;t always working in our favor, but that of a privileged few. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait what? What alien forces. </p>

<p>And what traditions, culture, laws are we talking about here. </p>

<p>Lots of horrible stuff is happening and has happened in this country. There&#39;s quite a bit that our government hasn&#39;t protected at all. In many ways, it&#39;s acted against the supposed &quot;traditions&quot; and regularly violated them to sustain itself, no matter what parties are the majority.  </p>

<p>Free speech, free assembly, unlawful searches,... the government doesn&#39;t care about any of this anymore and it&#39;s wide out in the open. Laws don&#39;t matter. They only apply to us lower-class folks. Culture? Our culture has long been diluted with violence and fear of the &quot;other.&quot; </p>

There&#39;s a point where you have to be realistic. I&#39;m just not a sucker for blind flag waving. I&#39;m not paralyzed by fear, like you.

Even when I was younger everyone still kind of knew how to work together, then as I hit junior high and high school people all went to shit. Even the teachers, not just the students. It went from less about the group and more about the individuals. Teachers could pass or fail you just based off of their feelings towards you. And it&#39;s only gotten worse. The upper crust has become more and more focused on rising further while the bottom of the pie flattens and burns. But those on the bottom just keep wanting to be looked at and perceived as upper middle class so they look like they are somebody, and live well above their means forcing debt onto their kids. And the cycle just keeps getting worse.

<p>I was the same way, always laughed at people who seriously used the term &quot;New World Order,&quot; but now I actually see it as the reality. </p>

<p>The &quot;NWO&quot; is NATO and all the leading governments that justify ruling over people, all the countries that are imposing corporate rule on the rest of the world. It&#39;s the super rich, who feel entitled to compound their wealth, while the impoverished suffer. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always felt the multinational corporate agenda to be at odds with what is best for humanity, even as a little kid. It&#39;s just NEVER added up, never made sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I&#39;m not saying they can&#39;t have meaning to some people, they&#39;ve just never had much of an effect on me. </p>

<p>For me, a symbol doesn&#39;t mean much if the people behind it don&#39;t really embody what it stands for. Unfortunately, the people don&#39;t most of the time, so they end up being used as mere propaganda tools by those with the worst of intentions. I guess that&#39;s my aversion to it all, in a nutshell. I&#39;m naturally suspicious toward things like that and I always have been. But I know what you&#39;re saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you&#39;re saying, but I still think it&#39;s utterly meaningless. It doesn&#39;t help when people use the pledge and everything else that is vaguely nationalist in this country to enforce the horrible things that are occurring and will continue to. When used in that way, it makes it seem more to be a propaganda tool than an expression of love for one&#39;s country. The only people that <em>do</em> seem to take it seriously are the military, the ones that actually have to fight and possibly pay with their blood. To business people and most citizens it&#39;s just a way to propagandize a warped nationalistic view of the world that places American lives above everyone else, and American capital above &quot;everywhere else&quot; capital. </p>

<p>A good example is soldier salutes at sports games. For me, I know a lot of vets, and while some might enjoy that stuff I&#39;ve met plenty that hate the flag waving and incessant salutes. I&#39;ve always found it to be a blind embrace of militarism on the part of citizens, and a way to trivilize war as a means to solving problems. In other words, I think it&#39;s more a national embarassment on the part of the citizenry, as it shows that we aren&#39;t very critical of the many armed conflicts we choose to partake in. I think a huge part of this is due to the fact that the US no longer has a draft. There is no collective effort behind wars we fight anymore, so vets are essentially forced to shoulder ALL of the burden.  </p>

<p>Too many people are convinced that one is &quot;un-American&quot; if they are &quot;pro-peace,&quot; which I&#39;ve always found to be completely backwards as well. Yet, the media, school teachers, church goers,... all institutional authorities seem to enforce that narrative. </p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t be trivializing or romanticizing war at all. I wish people were more serious about it, but most people I know seem to be brainwashed by the Hollywood view of war than the actual reality. Every time they bring out vets for every single sports game, it seems like they&#39;re endorsing it as &quot;this is how we solve conflicts in the 21st century.&quot; </p>

<p>I disagree with it completely. And it&#39;s similar with how they show soldier homecomings all over the media. It&#39;s the new normal, and frankly I have always thought it was disgusting. I don&#39;t want to see some guy&#39;s emotional breakdown plastered on corporate media, I just want to grant him some peace and quiet with his family and leave him alone for once, especially after being deployed. I don&#39;t know him and he doesn&#39;t know me, I&#39;m supportive of him and glad he&#39;s alive, sure, but beyond that I really don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>We can have our own ideas of what the country ought to be, but I&#39;ve never understood what symbols, slogans, and salutes have to do with any of that. </p>

<p>For all the time wasted by the pledge, we could be planting trees or whatever else over the course of a lifetime. There&#39;s a lot of other more constructing things to use our time and money for. </p>

<p>However, if you like the pledge and stuff, I&#39;m not going to harass you about it. If you believe in that kind of stuff, by all means, say it loud and proud, just be sure that you embody the values the symbols are supposed to is all I ask. </p>

<p>It means different things to different people and I get that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a difference between a one world government and a one world community. The path to our salvation is in the one world community and the path to our total enslavement is in the one world government. To maintain power at such a large scale requires a lot of craftiness, deception, fear, smoke and mirrors and most importantly the division of the world community. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean that having separate nations is a good thing. In fact I hope and pray that the concept of a nation will be gone very very soon. I just think that a one world government will always be a shadow government because if the people were united throughout the world, it would be impossible for any entity to maintain power. </p>

<p>I think when the one world community prevails, so will common sense and common sense is what will dictate our interaction with each other, which will not require any consolidation of power. We will learn exactly what it is to be a human, not what it is to be an American or a woman or white or muslim or this or that. No, we will know and grow to love our humanity instead of any other false identity that currently imprisons us. </p>

<p>i dont know what the future holds, but i can tell you its rather bleak looking. The family doesnt have dinner together, they dont watch TV together, they dont do much of anything. </p>

<p>Our society pits neighbors against neighbors, either by money/status, or race/culture, or politics. </p>

<p>i recall a time when everyone had something... either lawn care, cars/motorcycles, family, hobbies/skills of many varieties. now nobody has anything, they just buy the next cookie cutter car from wherever and bring it in to get the tires checked. </p>

<p>i remember jobs were 8-10 hours during the week and everyone had friday night-sunday evening off, they would go camping, day trips, bars, something... now they stay in and sit on the computer/phone. </p>

<p>I am guilty of many of these things, i used to love going to the bar, but cops got so bad i refuse to drive after 2 beers (no public transport in my area), I used to have bonfires and cookouts, but people stopped showing up for free food/beer. half my friends, and myself included work odd schedules and often conflicting, so no weekend gatherings. </p>

<p>all of this and more, this is not a uncommon situation for people i know all around the states. either no work, or too much work, and the people with too much work still cant afford the extras. I dont know how or what changed everything, but i can tell you I dont like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting you say this, I recently asked one of my Mom&#39;s business partners who is in his late 70&#39;s about what he thought was going on and he concluded the same thing.</p>

<p>There certainly seems to be a global push to a one-world government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile when you really look at what&#39;s happening in Europe right now the &quot;refugee&quot; crisis is starting to look more like an all out invasion. There&#39;s literally even WW2 style &quot;camps&quot; and ghettos popping up all over Europe right now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the US you have Trump pushing for a return to authoritative Nationalism, Bernie pushing for us to become more like socialized Europe, and Hillary backing the global elite to further push us down the path of globalization.</p>

<p>The real shadow government behind all of this seems to be the big banks and central banks as far as I can tell, and the Federal Reserve seems to be leading the pack.</p>

<p>On one hand, the notion of a single world government could be amazing for a lot of people if it is a democratic society with established rights and freedoms. On the other hand it could result in global oppression and slavery ruled by a rich global elite.</p>

- Akira Kurosawa  </p>

<p>People don&#39;t have time to think anymore. People don&#39;t realise that there is a problem because they&#39;re too busy contributing to that same problem.  </p>

<p>A good example is the Manhatten Project; over 100.000 people helped to build the first atom bomb. Yet, only a dozen knew what they were actually making!<br/>
That, is the power of hierarchy. You don&#39;t get to see the bigger picture.  </p>

<p>People work from 9 to 5, at some underpaid factory job, only to produce consumption goods to feed our sickening materialistic needs. They don&#39;t have time to cook anymore, so they heat up some ready-made dish. Then they go watch some propaganda and bread and circusses on their TV, go to sleep, and wait for their alarm clock to wake them up instead of naturally waking up. Then they drink caffeine to cope with the lack of sleep, and the routine can repeat itself! That for 40 years, until they are dead almost.  </p>

<p>My mother being invalid, she doesn&#39;t even know what to do anymore now that she can&#39;t work anymore.<br/>
She watches TV all day long, and browses fucking aliexpress to find stuff she could buy to fill her materialistic void of emptiness.<br/>
My stepdad being temporarily unemployed now, watches TV and gambles all day long. And of course, both smoke tobacco.  </p>

<p>At school they teach you to &quot;sell yourself&quot; when applying for a job.<br/>
You know why? Because we&#39;re prostitutes! We sell body and mind to make our &quot;pimps&quot; sleeping rich.<br/>
It&#39;s funny that society judges people who live off social welfare &quot;for being lazy&quot;, but they don&#39;t judge capitalistic sociopaths who sit on their asses all day long getting rich off their corporate slaves in the meantime. This system rewards the greedy and the apathic.<br/>
We are corporate slaves. They claim we aren&#39;t slaves because it&#39;s voluntarily. Wrong, we&#39;d starve without money in this current system we live in.<br/>
Which is also crazy, because we can&#39;t eat money. They&#39;re worthless pieces of paper which only have value, because we assign value to it.<br/>
We need to become self-sustainable and independant from money. Which is hard to do without an initial monetary investment.  </p>

<p>And then they use our tax money to fund wars, commit war crimes, and do basically anything BUT helping the people themselves.<br/>
Do you think that is a meaningful contribution to society? IMO, doing nothing is better than contributing to this insanity.<br/>
We don&#39;t work towards any goals. We have no aspirations. We are working towards self-annihilation.  </p>

<p>I recommend you to look into the principle of &quot;Basic Income&quot;<br/>
<a href="/r/basicincome">/r/basicincome</a>  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a great stepping stone to a better world. There&#39;s a FAQ on the subreddit and there&#39;s much more information you can find elsewhere online.
Even if you don&#39;t aggree with the idea, feel free to spark debate in the subreddit.</p>

<p>This made me laugh my ass off at the own absurdity of our species. Very well fucking said. We sell our labor and ever so fleeting time on the market like prostitutes, and society encourages it. This is corporate enslavement. As if this is all nessesary, or as if we are working towards some ultimate goal of humanity. </p>

<p>Its hilarious that people who are gluttonous have a disorder, and people who are addicted to drugs have a disorder. But the truly greedy bastards in our society, the narcissistic corporate CEOs, are known as &quot;ambitious&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is most insane of all about our culture is that we&#39;ve claimed reforming our economy &quot;off the table&quot;.  We can change nature, surely, just use science!  But changing the economy - NO WAY.  Oddly, the economy is manmade, yet we worship it as if it were an unknowable god.  I&#39;m not even talking socialism, just fixing the broken/corrupt way in which money is created and distributed.</p>

<p>Basic income is the right direction but it should be tied into currency creation.  As in, all money created by the government is distributed in the form of basic income.  Otherwise the people at the top still get infinite digits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone else read Infinite Jest? I started reading it recently and found it very coincidental that this post popped up on the front page since the book is basically about addiction and coping with society. </p>

<p>In my opinion addictions are what help us cope while we become cogs in the machine. If you&#39;re like me and you have a true initiative to escape the machine, then you can see your addictions as barriers. Others that accept their role in society see them as the best part of their day, the after work drink, the pack a day, tinder, etc. The real goal is to be able to control every aspect of your life, and when you have to go to work for 40 hours a week, which is usually beyond your control, then you overcompensate in the areas that you can control, and that leads to overindulgence and addiction. Just my interpretation of the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I understand that and respect you for it. I&#39;m just speaking about the hamster wheel that is the college loans/tuition situation. </p>

<p>When I was growing up, it was ingrained that you had to &quot;go to college and get a degree so you could get a good job after&quot;. During this, the government passed a law giving more people access to college through less stringent requirements on college loans from people like Sallie Mae.</p>

<p>So I got my college loans and went to college. Along with thousands and thousands of others. Colleges saw this uprise and thought &quot; we should raise tuition/et all to increase profits&quot;. College prices went up, these acceptable loans went up, the number of people paying more to go to school goes up. You get your degree and go to look for a job. Guess what? So many recent graduates are diluting the field that demand is super fucking low. Good luck paying off those ever expanding loans.</p>

<p>I was saying that (at least I hope) enough people will wake up to this scam where they all decide to learn in an autodidactic fashion. If enough people do this, that whole &quot;degree and 2 years job experience&quot; (when it is placed on opening position jobs, assuming you can get by on a free internship) opening credentials will not be possible.</p>

<p>You need to find out how to be funded to educate people that DONT buy into this hamster wheel. Or in a relevant trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It became the Byzantine Empire? Which became the Ottoman Empire? Which became Turkey? Self-preservation will always win out. To lay everything at the feet of greed is to discount man&#39;s thirst for immortality; hence the search for religion, or, in our case, a company that will last and out-compete the others. The basis of capitalism is competition, and you can&#39;t compete if you&#39;re dead or have no place in which to conduct business. </p>

<p>Even from a PR standpoint, a certain amount of posturing will always be required in terms of environmentalism, false altruism, etc., so I think SOME of that is bound to actually take hold. Plus, from an historical perspective, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever possible to control every single person on Earth all the time. Not every system/government can cover up EVERY crack, so there&#39;s always going to be dissent. Conglomerates eat each other and break apart/are broken apart.

We in America have Ford and Cheverolet that have cars that can go up to 150 MPH.  Yet our max speed limit is 75 MPH.  Now why would they do that?  Why? because if you take your car on a race track and hit the gas and go to 80, then 90 and then up to 100, you start freaking out because you feel like you are breaking the law even though you are allowed to go as fast as you want on that race track.

    <div class="md"><p>In America, our car companies make vehicles that go up to 150 MPH but with no place in the US to drive that fast.   Yet we see it on our speedometer everyday, the fastest you can drive is 150, but you can&#39;t, cause we won&#39;t let you.  That&#39;s my point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I truly believe there is an effort to remove all things that make us human.  All of the things that keep us attached to nature and make us human are being rejected and it&#39;s desensitizing us.  The good old days were about kindness, and about how we all felt and the goal was to help everyone be happy.  However, in that time what made me happy also made you happy, and that also made mom, dad, grand parents happy.  So as a collective we all worked towards pretty much the same goal.  Happy loving family was the goal and everyone worked to make that goal happen, it was a collective effort and made us all feel worthy and part of something.</p>

<p>Then that was destroyed.  Greed of the 80&#39;s set in and it was okay to be selfish and everyone pushed for individual achievement and gain at all costs.  Then jealousy set in and others continued and thus the rat race started.  The superficial prizes - money, cars, houses, jewelry, and wealth were more valuable than a stable family.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think we feel lost as humans because we are trying to acquire and value things that do not make us feel human.   There&#39;s no connection.   Even today, technology that keeps us connected 24/7, yet we do not &quot;connect&quot; with the person we connect with the technology.  It&#39;s a false sense of human interaction.  </p>

<p>The other thing for me is this false sense of empowerment through technology that makes us thing we can control everything.   The very concept of letting go of things you cannot control does not resonate.  For me, it took <a href="http://www.ideasforthoughtfulparents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Dont-Worry1.jpg">this simply flow chart </a> to make me realize I can only worry about the things I can control.   I do believe in God so when you give up control of those things you cannot control to him, then in some crazy way it relieves a lot of pressure from work, life and family.   </p>

<p>Finally, the concepts of love, compassion, understanding and overall general mentality of being nice and helpful are seen as weaknesses in today&#39;s society.  But there will be an awakening, because everyone has to go through that growth where they try to find joy in those superficial things only to find out that the things that make us human bring the most happiness.  People are figuring out that &quot;reality&quot; shows are lies and things you buy (which is why you work so hard to make more money) to make you happy really don&#39;t.</p>

<p>(Note: I apologize if I&#39;m all over the road with my thoughts, but I hope you understand I&#39;m with you.  There is an effort in mass human mental programming).</p>

I hope you feel invigorated by knowing you are not alone in this world, and you&#39;re just as precious to the world as everyone else is. It may seem like society itself is dark, jaded, twisted, and/or addicted to something that seems weird/ludicrous/insane, but in the end we&#39;re going to free ourselves from this madness one way or another. </p>

<p>The grip of the rich banksters and corporate sell-outs will end eventually. Don&#39;t give up hope. :)</p>

<p>You may want to watch or listen to a few podcasts from the <a href="/r/JoeRogan/">/r/JoeRogan/</a> sub-reddit. He&#39;s an interesting guy, but only if you have time while heading off to work to listen. It can be quite lengthy, but he does reveal a lot from his perspective of how we&#39;re entrapped, and that there&#39;s more out there than we can possibly imagine. </p>

<p>Cheers! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ve also experienced a lot of negativity on this sub-reddit, as well as a few others. Hence, I&#39;ve been quiet for the past little while now because I don&#39;t have time to deal with dullards or people who put others down. If you have HBO, you should watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3152306/"><strong>episode 6 of &#39;Darknet&#39;</strong></a>. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have HBO, but I&#39;ve been told that the 90% of the Internet we don&#39;t see is very seedy and dark/corrupted. There are people out there who make &#39;bots&#39; just to insult or tease people, even common sense &amp; empathetic comments will be drilled down into the abyss of obscenity. </p>

<p>So basically what I&#39;m trying to say is that even though you may post a logical or good post, there are people (paid by marketing firms), and/or bots (created by marketing firms or very jaded people) who try to sway the conversation into one direction. It is evil, it is cruel, and it is inhumane. But it is done solely for the purposes of ruining and/or hurting another person&#39;s position. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I get angry too, and I feel hurt inside whenever I see a huge avalanche of downvotes or people just making fun of me, but in the end there are some very jaded individuals out there who just want some attention because they never get any attention in real life. </p>

<p>As long as we arm ourselves with <strong>knowledge</strong>, help others, be kind &amp; empathetic, and love ourselves, then all these evil greedy pricks (corporate elite, bankers, controllers, etc.) can go suck a lemon for all I care. </p>

<p>They try to entrap us with this fake funny money, and put us indebted for life. They put misery and hardship to young people, and I&#39;m not saying all people are kept down in the doldrums for life, as quite a few people make a name for themselves &amp; become successful (Elon Musk or Oprah Winfrey, etc.), but right now the system has entrapped us into a hellhole of enslavement to funny money (wealth created out of debt no thanks to high interest paid back to the &#39;banksters&#39;), as well the continuous war on drugs (what a joke) and terror (bombing more people to make them hate us more). </p>

<p>Take care, and write whenever you feel down or want to chat. Cheers. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think every one of us is composed of a physical body and a spiritual soul. I think at the moment of physical death our soul leaves our body and lives on for Eternity. I believe we will be judged for our actions here during our physical life and spend eternity in either a heaven or hell. I feel most complete when I exercise my spiritual portion of my being just as I exercise my physical body. I think too many people forget that we have a spirit that needs to be exercised and that loss is a huge reason why people don&#39;t feel &quot;complete&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>It is rare anymore that I read anything this well written OP.  Your assessment of todays society is absolutely spot on, and you actually gave this <em>&quot;old man&quot;</em> something to think about.  You have managed to put into words something that I have been contemplating for many years now, and I thank you for that.</p>

<p>I have felt this way about the current times we live in for awhile, but I have had trouble trying to verbalize it for whatever reason, it has always been just a &quot;feeling&quot; so to speak.  Now, I can actually begin analyze and rationalize these things and try to make better sense of it.  In all truthfulness, I believe it will be impossible to make any sense of it, but at least I have something to work with now.  If no one has ever told you this before, I will; You are very wise OP, much wiser than you probably think you are.  Please continue to be a free and critical thinker, and to also share these thoughts with others.  Thank you for this wonderful thread.</p>

<li>I said I am an &quot;old man&quot; but I am not really that old, mid-forties.  I just feel older due to 20+ years active military service, and all of the abuse my body has sustained over the years.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it all started with a spiritual awakening that really kicked off after reading The Law of One. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a progressive journey since then. I&#39;ve quit drinking and smoking pot. I eat pretty well. Recently quit wheat to try to help reduce my glyphosate intake.</p>

<p>I exercise as much as I can fit into my schedule. 30 min of yoga 5 days a week and 10 min of meditation a day at least. Before I had a kid and got into yoga I was doing lots of hiking and trail running which I don&#39;t have much time for anymore. </p>

<p>I read a little each day that is spiritually inspirational. I&#39;ve got a long list of books I want to read. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the most important thing is the inner work. Everything else is fake! While I still follow conspiracies and the news etc. I don&#39;t get myself upset over the outer things anymore. I can watch from a neutral place and take data in from all over. I know I may never know the total truth and I&#39;ve come to terms with that. </p>

<p>I have decided to make the fools choice and step off the cliff living a life of faith. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I will catch some flack for this response. Does that answer your question?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right.  People cannot deal with reality anymore, and they have to drown in out in some way/shape/form.  I would not necessarily say everyone is addicted to something in order to achieve this, but rathe dependent on it.  There is a difference.</p>

<p>When any discussion about the myriad of problems we face is begun, people start getting angry, anxious, or flat out deny the problem even exists.</p>

<p>We are an incredibly short-sighted species; our way of life (mostly, the American way) is deteriorating and destroying the habitat in which we live in, and robbing us of our humanity.  This is indirectly affecting us all, polarizing us, separating us, when in fact, we should be uniting against our common enemy.  Capitalism/greed is the virus that started this downward spiral, and extinguishing the virus is the only way to ensure our survival of the species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re getting at the root of most of modern western societies&#39; problems. Take climate change. The focus is on how we can change policies that will decrease emissions. That&#39;s not addressing the sickness, that&#39;s addressing the symptom. We can&#39;t change the climate, we can only change ourselves. Man made climate change is a result of our selfishness, greed, and apathy. Fix ourselves first, and the rest will follow.</p>

<p>When you are born, you do not know the difference between yourself and the people around you. We have to learn that other people are separate beings with their own consciousness, feelings, and so on. We learn that that thing flying around in front of our face is our hand, and we can control it and use it to manipulate objects. We place no value upon external objects. We are taught that these things have some kind of inherent value. &quot;Don&#39;t touch that, you&#39;re going to break it.&quot; This toy is &quot;mine&quot;, not &quot;ours&quot;. We covet things and ignore them once we have them. That&#39;s because we still realize somewhere deep down that they have no real value. We teach ourselves that the world is physical and real, that objects are exactly as they seem. Naive realism is easy to believe in...just look around you. Things seem solid, real enough. I am here and my friend is over there. An idiot could see that right? </p>

<p>Western society takes advantage of these ignorant beliefs. The result is that we live out our days in the pursuit of material wealth, and we try to control our external environment (people, objects), in order to try to make ourselves happy. The result is mostly the opposite. We have no real control over our external environment, and the attempt to do so usually only ends up in high levels of stress and unhappiness. We percieve ourselves as separate from everyone and everything, and society drives us to compete, fight, and squander using that perception.</p>

<p>At the same time comes the rise of scientism. Science is a pure method, but scientists are not pure. Scientists are human beings who have the same ignorant beliefs as anyone else. Their models and theories are mostly wrong, because they begin with the same flawed understanding of the nature of reality that we all teach ourselves. Yet for the most part scientism is growing because scientists, despite their flaws, provide us with more and better external &quot;objects&quot; to play with. We believe what scientists tell us, because they have a system where a lot of other scientists with the same dysfunctional beliefs review their papers and tell them they are right. Technology is great, but it is meaningless without an equal amount of wisdom and moral maturity.</p>

<p>People feel the need to fill their every waking hour with some kind of activity or distraction. If you&#39;re not working you&#39;re at a club or watching TV or playing a video game or whatever. I think it is a necessity in modern society, because when we take away all of that distraction...what do we have? We are left with only our thoughts. All the &#39;stuff&#39; we have amassed lies around us as we sit on our couch in what amounts to a hollow meaningless residence. What difference does it make whether we get that new job in a week, or if we can afford that new best thing that just came out the other day, or if our friends like us, or how neat our haircut is, or whether we live another 50 years or another 50 minutes? The thought creeps up that perhaps it is also a meaningless existence. But this isn&#39;t necessarily true. We confuse the meaninglessness of apparently external objects with meaninglessness of existence.</p>

<p>So what does it all mean? What is our purpose here? Do we even have one? It&#39;s the ultimate paradox of existence. On the surface, we can&#39;t seem to see any objective meaning to life...yet at the same time we fear death. Are we all nothing more than bipedal sacks of meat and bones with a particular configuration of neurons in our brain that just so happens to give rise to consciousness? Western society and scientism would have you believe so, yet they have no real answers to these questions. The questions that matter the most. The answer can&#39;t be found by examining your environment. No one can tell you or make you realize the answers. The true answers to these questions can only come from within. Ask yourself the big questions. As Alan Watts once said: We all ask ourselves the question &quot;what will it be like to go to sleep and never wake up?&quot;. Now is the time to ask yourself &quot;what was it like to wake up having never gone to sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>To attain true happiness, you must forget all that you have been taught. Unlearn what you have been learning from the day you were born. Things taught to you not only by society, but by yourself and your five senses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much agree, OP. </p>

<p>When I was young (and exceedingly happy), I valued: </p>

<p>-Hanging out with close friends and family </p>

<p>-Spending lots of time outside, in nature</p>

<p>-Learning new things that excited me (reading about epic historical battles or outer space) </p>

<p>-Feeling a sense of community. I knew all the kids in town, got piano lessons from a lady down the street, etc. </p>

<p>-Being active, running around, playing pick up sports</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any of these values are particularly childish; in fact, these activities are all important for adults to do as well. And yet...they seem so much harder for us. Why is this? </p>

<p>I noticed throughout high school and college that the lifestyle I described above seemed to be under attack. Again and again I found myself compromising, and sometimes outright switching my point-of-view in order to not stand out. </p>

<p>Embracing the local community? Psh, as high schoolers we&#39;d rip on our hometown. We couldn&#39;t wait to &#39;escape&#39; to the promised land of college. Not to mention that high school cliques divided everyone in my class. Suddenly you had a specific rep and were only permitted to hang out with a select group of kids.</p>

<p>Embracing the great outdoors? Yeah that&#39;s not possible when you have school, sports, extracurriculars, homework, and a social scene to navigate. </p>

<p>By the time I got to college it&#39;s like my values (and those of my peers) had been totally inverted. Suddenly you only learned stuff if it applied to your career (anything else was &#39;a waste of time.&#39;) Low-grade addictions of every kind, laziness, etc. was all tolerated and even expected. There was no longer any &#39;community.&#39; In fact, competition between students (for grades, club admissions, even sexual exploits) was encouraged. </p>

<p>Then after college 70+% of kids in my class graduated in debt, moved to whatever city they got a job in (even if they didn&#39;t know a soul there), and became fixated on money, money, money. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like being slowly fed into a great machine. When I look back over my life, I see how we are slowly conditioned year after year to go along. </p>

<p>In my town, sports switch from being run by the town to being run by the school in 7th grade. I kind of benefited from this, since I played a lot of sports growing up, but right away school ceased to be a place dedicated solely to learning. Athletes were now cool, and others less so. &#39;Popularity&#39; became a thing. </p>

<p>In 7th grade the school also began hosting dances. I remember some Fridays I went to class, then sports, home to shower, and then back to school for the big dance. My &quot;center of gravity&quot; so to speak had shifted from <strong>home/family/friends</strong> to <strong>school/peer group/competition.</strong> </p>

<p>&#39;The system&#39; draws us away from our roots. It&#39;s centralized power; it sucks up autonomous individuals and spits them out clones who have no roots or connections to the land or those around them. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right on about &#39;mainstream society&#39; being mad. But we must not try to <em>escape</em> (that&#39;s built into the system and always ends in self-destruction.) Rather, we need to simply become better than the machine and rise above it. We need to be smarter, tougher, and more creative, and take ownership of our lives. Then we can create beautiful lifestyles that make us happy while also helping the world at large. </p>

<p>In fact, if you open your mind with hallucinogens you will still need to meditate faithfully to cultivate the benefits of your experience. So my advice is skip the drugs and do the right thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rousseau wrote about the &quot;social contract&quot;. Part of that contract is giving up individualism and individual freedoms. To be part of a society, you must accept the fact that you have to contribute even if it is to your own detriment.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that humans did not evolve to push buttons and fold clothes. We evolved just like every other animal. But we sacrificed a lot of the freedom we had to become <em>much safer</em> and <em>to advance ourselves as a species</em> consciously or subconsciously. The addiction you mention is an effect which is primarily caused by the fact that for society to function, the vast majority of people have to do the same thing day after day after day. You have to wake up, go to work, go back home, and do everything to prepare to work.</p>

<p>It would help to explain this if you viewed humanity now as a single organism rather than individuals. Then the entire thing makes more sense. </p>

<p>I can recommend a couple of things that will snap you out of it really fast, though, if you are willing to do them. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start your own business/work for yourself. Be the captain of your own ship.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect with nature by going hunting and eating the food that you caught yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise every single day.</p></li>
<li><p>Take up a martial art. Preferably a full contact one.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Lot of people will say these are dumb or that I am being idealistic, but honestly if you want to feel alive, go out in the woods and feel the stillness before you kill something to feed yourself. Go toe to toe with somebody in a gym in a combat situation. Have the feeling that if you don&#39;t get up and get going, you won&#39;t have enough food or money to eat or sleep for the next couple months.</p>

<p>None of this stuff is easy. Infinitely rewarding though. Camus said that the only real philosophical question is whether or not to commit suicide. Once you decide you want to live, you are basically accepting the fact that the only one responsible for your life is yourself. Thus, you have to come up with a framework to live by. Reasons to live. Because if you can&#39;t think of any reasons to live, what&#39;s the point? And believe me when I say, if you put 90% of people on the spot, they won&#39;t have a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are shockingly unhappy with their lives and do mindless things to escape from it. I don&#39;t blame them. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s their fault at all. I was very independent and interested in reading from the time I was very small. If I wasn&#39;t, the system would probably have me like it does everyone else.</p>

<p>The system sets you up to be part of society and doesn&#39;t bother to teach you that there are things <em>outside of that</em>. You know? You go from being a student to suddenly working 40 hours a week. You get tired. You eat what authorities tell you to eat because you think that&#39;s what is right, even if it ends up with you havning diabetes. That&#39;s why I think movements like paleo and ketogenic diets are interesting, for example. Here you have people saying &quot;no, you can&#39;t stay ketogenic for long&quot; (like my grad school biochem professor). Meanwhile you have people out there saying &quot;I can&#39;t, watch me.&quot; and staying in for 2+ years and fixing a ton of health issues.</p>

<p>I really enjoy watching underground movements buck the systems we have in place. There&#39;s hope out there. You just have to know where to look. And where to avoid. Unfortunately, I mostly avoid this sub because while there are independent thinkers here, there are a ton of crazies here as well. </p>

<p>You have to keep an open mind about things, but that <em>does not</em> mean you need to believe everything you hear that runs counter to popular opinion. In this very thread, I saw a guy link to a giant article on an iffy site about contrails. Not to derail the thread, but the sources in that article don&#39;t indicate even half of what they are claiming it does. This is coming from somebody with an M.S. in a STEM field.  </p>

<p>A healthy dose of skepticism is a good thing to have. You should always be skeptical of the official narrative and do your own research. But as soon as I start seeing people implying that airplanes are poisoning the entire world with aluminum as a New World Order population reduction plan, I have to roll my eyes. I really don&#39;t even know how this comment will be met. Maybe I&#39;ll be downvoted to hell or called a shill or something. But I don&#39;t buy that level of conspiracy at all. Not even close.</p>

<p>Edit: Take Monsanto for instance. And let&#39;s utilize Occam&#39;s Razor. What&#39;s more likely: That they are just a bunch of greedy idiots who don&#39;t see the implications of some of the genetic modifications they do OR that they are a shadowy nefarious organization working for the NWO specifically trying to destroy the ecosystem and control the population? I go with the former. Occam&#39;s Razor should really come into play more often here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly not trying to be insulting, but you contradict yourself. On the one hand, you say not to trust everything shoved down your throat - even at the post-grad level like your biochem professor - and on the other hand you imply that someone who doesn&#39;t have an MS in a STEM field might be one of the &quot;crazies&quot; because he doesn&#39;t source his material properly and doesn&#39;t have a degree you deem valuable. Do you see the contradiction there? (By the way, I have no opinion on the contrail issue as I haven&#39;t personally thoroughly investigated it).  </p>

<p>I think what you may mean - and I what <strong>I believe</strong> - is that students shouldn&#39;t be taught to memorize what was written in a book but should be taught how to think critically for themselves. There should be whole classes offered that teach you how to perform proper research &amp; define what constitutes meaningful sourcing versus quoting someone with an off-the-wall theory (and what may have influenced that way of thinking), so that you can make an intelligent, informed decision ON YOUR OWN.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t imply that people without an MS in a STEM field or any field might be crazies. Material needs to be sourced, that&#39;s how it works. You can&#39;t source something, then use that source to make an assumption that the source material never states, then broadly apply that assumption as fact.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t twist my words by implying I&#39;m some sort of elitist, that isn&#39;t what I was doing at all.</p>

<p>Edit: In case this sounded dismissive, let me rephrase: If it seemed like I was implying that, I wasn&#39;t. I also do not think people who have different opinions than me are crazy. I have an open mind. But I am pretty strict in what I will accept as evidence, and that puts my on the opposing view of a lot of people I see on this sub (not that I hold anything against anyone for believing whatever they want).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i made a mention of no hobbies/specialties anymore in this thread. almost like people forgot how to do thinks. I have too many hobbies, but im buying some time due to a poor childhood, and rough 20&#39;s.</p>

<p>part of my problem is 6-8 months out of the year the weather is terrible and i lock myself inside. but im trying to bring the community feel back, i want friends to show up at my house and have a cookout/bonfire. i want to have the ability to not worry about my job weekly. i just want some humbleness in my life, and the world, quit trying to take more than your share, quite trying to take someone elses share. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, our society is sick.</p>

<p>Take for example the idea of how we Americans mindlessly celebrate the great, forward thinking forefathers... while brandishing OTHERS as terrorists... and not own up to the fact that this nation only exists because U.S. terrorists MURDERED millions of Native Americans.</p>

<p>Thank god for Liberty, which comes after genocidal massacre... I guess.</p>

<p>And here we are: celebrating this shit.</p>

<p>This is but a microcosm of the ignorance we persist which is applicable to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Society is sick, and us white devil-snakes are a virus spread before the earth with our solutions of &quot;westernization&quot;. This unhealthy focus on materialism, and not humanity: is the fire-water that destroys the organism, Earth.</p>

<p>Here we are: exhausting every single facet of sustainable life... and yet... by this very definition we are &quot;sane&quot; LOL!!!!</p>

<p>So as man becomes even more SICK (imbalanced), the definition and bar for Sanity appears to drop even lower with it&#39;s gradual peak in ignorance and lust for &quot;self-persistence&quot; through overwhelming, collectively influenced, SELF-DESTRUCTION</p>

<p>There are many children behind the wheel, and this is who steers the car of the world: a bunch of moronic idiots.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s even possible that a person like Sarah Palin could get anywhere near as much television time as she&#39;s had. Much less, a sign of the times may be that Trump is actually running, and in many cases, leading for President.</p>

<p>We really need to take a step back and rethink this situation, our situation, together.</p>

<p>If we can&#39;t, together, elevate our collective consciousness... the human species will be doomed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a shift I have noticed.</p>

<p>I noticed this in the business world.   I have worked for the same company for 25 years, and things have had a major change that happened slowly but is so clear when I look back.</p>

<p>It used to be that people in my company did the right thing, that they cared how things were done and strive to do things better and be innovative and creative to get things done in their part of the business.</p>

<p>These days absolutely no one will make a decision or take a stand or offer their own opinion in most business settings.  </p>

<p>Management is useless and have no power or ability to make their own decisions.   Managers today are expected to all be yes men, all expected to just blindly do whatever is dictated to them from above, no matter if it is the best thing for their part of the  business or not, they are afraid of offending someone or breaking some rule by doing something they are not first told to do.</p>

<p>I believe this is yet another symptom of growing centralized totalitarianism.  People are now conditioned for all power and decisions to be made from &#39;above&#39; in a very authoritarian way.  The way people act in business has been affected by the same growing sense of centralized control as people now have with a massive growing centralized all-knowing, all-controlling government system.</p>

<p>No one gives a crap anymore because they have been stripped of their individual authority in every aspect of their life from entities &#39;above&#39; and they just are going through life doing what they are told, not rocking the boat, not needed to take responsibility for anything but just getting along another day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad.  </p>

<p>I believe this is yet another symptom of growing centralized totalitarianism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. &quot;As above, so below&quot; the old adage goes. If you&#39;re living in an increasingly totalitarian society, this attitude will also be reflected on the personal/individual level. </p>

<p>Highly respected sources - Jimmy Carter and a major Princeton study to name two - now refer to the United States as an oligarchy. William Binney, the former technical director of the NSA (and a legend within the organization) has referred to the U.S. as a &quot;pre-fascist society.&quot; Income inequality is at the highest level since the 1920s. We are undoubtedly entering an age of highly centralized government power. </p>

<p><em>Why</em> this is happening is less clear. It&#39;s likely in part due to technology - which has shrunk the world to an unprecedented size. Global trade is naturally going to bring along more regulations, less national sovereignty, etc. Technology eliminates middle-class jobs, exacerbating income inequality and therefore requiring the ruling class to militarize the police to protect themselves. Finally, governments now have tools to spy and wreak havoc that their predecessors only could&#39;ve dreamed of. </p>

<p>There also does seem to be an element of planned conspiracy. Insiders like Zbigniew Brzezinski predicted this all would happen back in the 1970s (Brzezinski literally wrote about &quot;the emergence of a more controlled society...&quot;) </p>

<p>I am currently planning my escape. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always think that these lifestyles are encouraged upon us because oil and big pharma have a lot of influence in the world. Big pharma wants you to over indulge and over eat and so do the companies who supply the food. </p>

<p>Big pharma wants you to be the unhealthiest person in the world. Why? The unhealthier you are the more likely you are to develop diabetes, cancer, heart disease, etc. What happens when you get these? You spend mad fucking money trying to get them fixed and under control. Something like diabetes you could be spending money on that the rest of your life. Cancer, you spend money on treatments for chemo and/or radiation which are expensive as fuck and hey, the cancer might come back.</p>

<p>And what do you need to do to get food, drugs, alcohol, sex, entertainment or even to go drive to the pharmacy or to the hospital for treatments? It usually requires you to drive somewhere or requires someone to drive somewhere, so you are using up oil and gas. Our lifestyles are encouraged by these companies and the media because it is a way to get our money. We happily spend our money on these things and everyone else reinforces it by telling us great it is to overeat, overwork, overindulge. Society is fucked up and the best way to make the most of it is to take great care of yourself and surround yourself with people who feel the same way. No one is perfect. I dabble with alcohol, weed, entertainment, sex. But I don&#39;t let it get in the way of my every day life. You can do things that might be frowned upon or supported by society, but do them in moderation. Love yourself. Take care of yourself. Don&#39;t allow yourself to become a part of the game that the corporations want you to be a part of.</p>

<p>Have you ever been inside a gas station? They sell alcohol, cigarettes, soda, candy, chips, the most unhealthy shit in the world. And they sell gas. Those places are cancer holes. You can&#39;t get anything healthy from a gas station. Big Pharma and Big Oil really were geniuses with gas stations. Both companies get your money and they fill you up with the most unhealthy foods in the world. Unless you&#39;re smart enough to not overindulge in that sugary goodness. I see so many fat people at gas stations though in America as well as all over America. And it is encouraged for a reason.</p>

Not only have they severely reduced attention spans, but they allow us to find like minded people and polarize our opinions more than ever, rather than using that access to create a more rounded world view.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I am certain that the governments of the world LOVE social media and smartphones. Because think about this: governments used to have to spy and use surveys to collect info on their people. However they got it, they had to put in some kind of effort. But now- the citizens themselves are broadcasting everything they think, do, and even EAT. Best part, all this info is public domain, stored electronically on servers for governments(or really anyone) to get an idea of what people like, do, eat etc. </p>

For instance if my coworker&#39;s found out that I was coming in early and leaving late without claiming OT, they would probably talk to me about setting a precedent, claiming all my hours, etc.  In America it seems like you guys think it&#39;s better to go to work with the plague and clock 5 hours OT without getting paid.

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense. They poison most everything else. They need slow soft kill methods that you can&#39;t trace to anything in particular. They just acted on an extremely stupid idea about reflecting sunlight to cool the atmosphere. It doesn&#39;t work and in fact does the opposite  and has brought Alzheimer&#39;s  disease (among  other newly common  neurodegenerative diseases)  to the point of being the number 3 killer of Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hubris. They didn&#39;t believe it could happen to them. and they didn&#39;t believe the nano particles of aluminum, called alumina, would come down. </p>

<p>The point is to change the reflectivity, or albedo of the earth by reflecting sunlight. Maybe there&#39;s some other expolanation for this kind of flight pattern.</p>

<p><a href="https://nevadastatepersonnelwatch.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/chemtrails-madness.jpg">https://nevadastatepersonnelwatch.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/chemtrails-madness.jpg</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ve seen your reflection in a piece of aluminum before haven&#39;t you? Didn&#39;t think so. It doesn&#39;t reflect well at all. It just heats up in the sun and traps heat below.</p>

<p>Any kind of cloud cover traps heat. Cloudy nights are warmer than clear ones for instance. Want to cool the earth, clear the sky.</p>

<p>So it was a stupid idea called geo-engineering, that will affect millions of us and most likely will never be admitted to. There has been a rapid, even unprecedented rise in mental disorders such as ADHD Bipolarism, Alzheimers and so on which can be tied to the rise in ambient aluminum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>a good tribe has a shared core of clearly stated beliefs, rights, goals and things like that</p>

<p>the united states and also the global system is the opposite, the actual beliefs rights and goals are obfuscated by by loudly promoted fake ones</p>

<p>ie the stated goal of invading iraq was to keep the usa safe, but it was actually to keep israel safe</p>

<p>the stated belief of the invasion was to install democracy, but it was actually to create isis and chaos for israel to manage</p>

<p>i can go on, the drug war, electronic voting, obamacare, charter schools, the stated intentions of these things are the opposite of whats advertised</p>

<p>so you get a mainstream of gullible people who just put the loudest thing they hear in their head as truth, and the rest of us who are sane get to live in a country where most people live in an illusion that doesnt hold up to the slightest bit of actual thought.</p>

<p>this is why humans have invented subculture, the birth of cool, so that we can establish our own communities of people who live outside the illusion</p>

<p>sometimes i wonder what a planet of 7 billion sentient beings who share an actual sane culture would look like, like a new verse from john lennons imagine....</p>

<p>ideas are their own rewards, surround yourself with people who live in reality is best you can do, wishing for society to make your thinking easier by everyone being idk smart is not going to get you far</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rediscover the Tao, as we are born with the way, but upon growing up we forget it. You can coexist with absurdity and laugh at its microcosmic aura afflicting mankind. Your soul is immortal, and we are parts of an ever-progressing machine of harmony. The truth is everything, and accepting the truth is the hardest part of self-actualization. </p>

<p>I know this sounds ridiculous and saccharine, but is it ridiculous to overcome and harmonize the mind in triumph against this madness? If I didn&#39;t know this myself, I wouldn&#39;t bother writing it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the perfect divide and conquer. Because when you divide and conquer by something like sexism or racism, then you still have groups of people who are on the same side, who might work together to accomplish something. If you can make every single person terrified and untrusting of every other person, then unification to better our situation becomes impossible. This is why general <em>fear</em> is the best divide and conquer tool of all, fear of other people. </p>

<p>If they can divide and conquer us a million different ways across a million different categories, which they have, then we start fearing anyone who fits in to any category, which is everyone. It&#39;s a self-imposed isolation, every man an island, rationalized through media-perpetuated myths. That is what they want indeed, but I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;ll give in to unnecessary fear of my fellow humans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think it is a simptom of the false belief that you can find happiness. Even the new age self help gurus are teaching people to find happiness within. From my experience anyone that is telling you you can find happiness is full of shit. The people I know who are happy, ARE happy and everyone else isn&#39;t</p>

<p>At some point about 3 years ago I decided I was just going to be happy no matter what and surprisingly it actually works. It took a little practice but now I am happy all the time and I do stuff because that is what life requires not because I am seeking happiness or fulfilmnet from it.</p>

While heck things were never perfect, generations learned to cope and interact in ways to overcome the indignities and unfairness. There was also instilled in (at least in the US) a hopefulness that you Coke work yourself out and up. Not guaranteed but a chance. What is happening now after a long fruitful period of growth and betterment, stagnation. Stagnation of hope and stagnation based on what we expect to be given and expect what the leaders can give us. That also led to lousy economics companies being cheap due to the lousy economy and a crushing tax burden to provide a huge percent of the population to be provided stuff that is now expected. Hence you work like a dog because you give a shit. You make up for those who don&#39;t and right now the fruits of your work seems like they are not getting you anywhere. Don&#39;t give up because it will pay off if you can hold yourself together. Last, have a moral compass. Yeah it may be religion or some higher belief, but we all need it. </p>

Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?</p>

That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. -whitman</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been through the same thing and my advice is this:</p>

<p>Happiness is something outside your control, its based on outside factors, so do not pursue that. Its fleeting and short-lived. Seek Contentment, which from what ive been able to tell is based on self, how you feel about who you are, what you do, etc. I have taken a hard look at this same subject and the terms joy and contentment have been replaced with Happiness. The most stressed people in the world i live in seem to also see Happiness as the end game, but those who seek joy and contentment in turn get happiness full time as a result. Thats really all i can offer because i am in the same boat</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somehow I think there are social and society-al &quot;mechanics&quot; at work that are in a way similar to evolution mechanics.</p>

<p>E.g. games: 2 teams create a game each, the more addictive one sells better. The losing team tries to learn what the other team&#39;s secret was, and tries to improve what they do. Their next game will be more addictive.</p>

<p>E.g. work: A high number of people do work with computers now, they don&#39;t need to do exhausting physical work. The &quot;produce&quot; the most &amp; best result when they work as long as possible and as fast as possible. Therefore the job should create some incentive to do that - the job may be fun in itself or have a high pay-per-result, good result are highly rewarding. Put the right people onto such job and they go self-addictive (if that&#39;s a word) and work until they burn out, all others leave for other jobs that fit them better but are less paid. It&#39;s difficult to put in words, but I think you get what I mean - these mechanics sort of come in place because they are the most successful <em>to achieve a job&#39;s goal</em>, not a person&#39;s one. So this supports lives going out of balance and tipping over into an extreme. As <em>you</em> already said: &quot;... I was overworking myself, but in our society that is celebrated. Overeat. Overwork. Overindulge.&quot; - because they are successful for short amounts of time and only these short amounts count for the society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this is all obvious to you all, but it just hit me really hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really obvious, it&#39;s rather &quot;creeping in&quot; and taken for granted, even if it&#39;s bad for everybody in the long run. (Somehow I feel unable to express what I mean, my thoughts revolve around the same general thing, trying to pack it in different words.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, our society is sick.</p>

<p>Take for example the idea of how we Americans mindlessly celebrate the great, forward thinking forefathers... while brandishing OTHERS as terrorists... and not own up to the fact that this nation only exists because U.S. terrorists MURDERED millions of Native Americans.</p>

<p>Thank god for Liberty, which comes after genocidal massacre... I guess.</p>

<p>And here we are: celebrating this shit.</p>

<p>This is but a microcosm of the ignorance we persist which is applicable to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Society is sick, and us white devil-snakes are a virus spread before the earth with our solutions of &quot;westernization&quot;. This unhealthy focus on materialism, and not humanity: is the fire-water that destroys the organism, Earth.</p>

<p>Here we are: exhausting every single facet of sustainable life... and yet... by this very definition we are &quot;sane&quot; LOL!!!!</p>

<p>So as man becomes even more SICK (imbalanced), the definition and bar for Sanity appears to drop even lower with it&#39;s gradual peak in ignorance and lust for &quot;self-persistence&quot; through overwhelming, collectively influenced, SELF-DESTRUCTION</p>

<p>There are many children behind the wheel, and this is who steers the car of the world: a bunch of moronic idiots.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s even possible that a person like Sarah Palin could get anywhere near as much television time as she&#39;s had. Much less, a sign of the times may be that Trump is actually running, and in many cases, leading for President.</p>

<p>We really need to take a step back and rethink this situation, our situation, together.</p>

<p>If we can&#39;t, together, elevate our collective consciousness... the human species will be doomed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this shift is a result of social media, sharing, and an always electronically connected life.</p>

<p>People within your network put a filter over what they share and others judge themselves against other people&#39;s filtered life.</p>

<p>This creates this cycle where you push harder yourself to &quot;compete&quot; with your network and they are doing the same with their network of filtered successes.</p>

<p>For example, you may have a 10-year old car - and so may 90% of your network, but the car posts you see are only of new cars being purchased - so you feel that everybody is buying these new cars all the time and you&#39;re wondering why you aren&#39;t so you work harder.</p>

<p>The &quot;addiction&quot; though may not be true addictions, but just a by-product of what people publish to their social media. If somebody is interested in the series The Voice for example, they may use their social media to engage on that show and all you&#39;ll see is that they are &quot;addicted&quot; to that entertainment.</p>

<p>For yourself and your stress, you just need to remember you&#39;re not competing against anybody - if you didn&#39;t have a filtered network of people to &quot;compete&quot; against, then you&#39;d be the one out in front of whatever your goals are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience I have found life to be...well...a lot. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot out there. Fucking so much. It is nearly impossible to even like verbalize all of it, let alone conceptualize it. </p>

<p>Like if you try to say all of it, you&#39;re going to say some of it wrong.</p>

<p>We kinda live in a society that looks for that one thing you say wrong as grounds for dismissal of the whole. </p>

<p>And we have a whole bunch of cliches and shit that you can say to feign understanding. AND I think we like to think we understand things. </p>

<p>We like things that make it easier to understand. We like things that help our brain release dopamine and serotonin. </p>

<p>I think we would all be happier if we lived in small communes in the wilderness. We were surrounded by people we knew and loved. We used our bodies to grow food. We had problems, sure, but we like, dealt with them. If we had a passion...like playing guitar...we could do it, we would have festivals and like a pub and shit. </p>

<p>Money and power don&#39;t really bring me happiness. But that&#39;s exactly what society kinda is made for. </p>

<p>Our society kinda provides a sidewalk for us to follow as we live our lives. </p>

<p>It is simply easier to go to the store and buy food than it is to grow my own. It is easier to get a job to afford food and shelter and water than it is to go get and build my own. Even if I did go live off in the woods or whatever the fuck, I would be sacrificing the people in my life and any sense of community. </p>

<p>Living on a commune with people is off the sidewalk. Out of the mainstream. </p>

<p>We&#39;re building this society...but to what ends? </p>

<p>Right now it seems like to an ends where there is some sort of elite/TPTB sort of group. Where all the people understand a little bit about everything, but not everything about it...but enough to make them have a thing to say about it and a thing to think about it and that&#39;s enough to feel good. </p>

<p>So there are some roles to be chosen. You can go along with the flow, follow the the path of least resistance and maybe climb a ladder and get enough out of the community you find yourself in. I may sound like I&#39;m shitting on this path...but it is 100% a path people can find contentment in. . You can even help give other people better lives in the process, as much as Family Guy doesn&#39;t bring anyone closer to nirvana or whatever the fuck is &quot;best thing&quot; to get out of life...there&#39;s something beautiful about a thing that can make someone&#39;s life better if only for 22 minutes. </p>

<p>Or you can try fight against the current. Try to alter the path of society and move it towards the sort of utopia you see. These are like the artist sorts of people or whatever else, they try to reveal a bit of truth. Just a bit. Those bits add up, people see it, people can tell when they see something real. Great works are great works for a reason, and it&#39;s because they change lives. This is probably the most dangerous path, and maybe hardest path, maybe the most noble path. It probably takes the most patience. It&#39;s like you have to passionately scream truth...but tactfully...and in a refined enough way. When you say something against the grain, something that might seem crazy, you cannot also be crazy or it&#39;ll be dismissed. 
It is also really important that what you have to say is actually truth, and not some delusion or whatever your mind has manufactured.  (Like talking about TPTB even sounds insane if you don&#39;t have actual evidence to substantiate your claims...I believe...but there is a logical jump of sorts at a certain level...and some people will not make that jump because it logically results in the belief in a lot of unfortunate truths)</p>

<p>Or you can go make a commune or some sort of different community. Honestly this path might be the healthiest on the individual level. Healthiest for your body for sure, healthiest for your mind probably too if you have any sort of social circle around you. </p>

<p>Or there are other options I haven&#39;t thought of. 
This is mostly the ramblings of a young human that has a tendency to spew out unrefined ramblings...so take it all with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>I might&#39;ve answered the question in question...or not. I kinda refuse to scroll up and I&#39;m just gonna try and hope to trust myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the madness is engineered. 
check out the series of links in <a href="https://ajl.smugmug.com/911/Disinformation">this gallery</a> I quote from one article: &quot; &quot;Persona Management Software:  Software will allow 10 personas per user, (some mention 25 different sock puppets accounts managed by one user) replete with background , history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent. Individual applications will enable an operator to exercise a number of different online persons from the same workstation and without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries. Personas must be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world and can interact through conventional online services and social media platforms. The service includes a user friendly application environment to maximize the user&#39;s situational awareness by displaying real-time local information. &quot;</p>

<p>Rest assured, 99.9 of the flat earth &quot;conspiracy&#39; nonsense that has invaded YouTube since about the middle of 2015 gets poured into the system to reinforce the meme that &#39;everything is a conspiracy&#39; and &#39;conspiracy theorists believe all kinds of insane pseudo-scientific nonsense.&#39; etc. 
A large percentage of what represents itself as 911/anthrax Truth, for example, is nonsense. Like that no plane hit the pentagon or the planes at the towers were holograms, or space beams were used to destroy them,,, and on and on and on. Despite all this nonsense, there is a large body of legitimate evidence and all we can hope for is that people can distinguish between pseudo-scientific nonsense and <a href="https://ajl.smugmug.com/911/North-Tower-Exploding">facts that are completely incompatible</a> with the official narrative with re. to the destruction of WTC 1 2 &amp; 7</p>

<p>This realization. Something I never would have even imagined was possible and even with all the evidence was still difficult to believe and it completely changed my view of our society. Between people&#39;s indifference and the fact that people could commit such horrendous acts of treason and crimes against humanity in the wars they served as pretext for, all while leaving a mountain of evidence in plain sight,, and still get away with it.. has just made me feel our society is a farce.  Laws don&#39;t really matter, and journalism, aside from small group of independent journalists, researchers and academics that outdo the msm as a matter of course, is a completely managed affair. That people like Amy Goodman, Noam Chomsky and Glenn Greenwald, and others (Jeremy &#39;and I say this after having watched Loose Change&quot; Schaill) etc,,say nothing has been mind-boggling and very revealing that even the vast majority of so-called &#39;dissenters&#39; remain silent. (&#39;controlled opposition&#39; is exactly what it looks like now). 
If one cannot honestly address the watershed event of our lives, then they&#39;re journalists in name only and certainly on the wrong side of history where this issue is concerned./ </p>

<p>I think we reached a point where our problems are a lot more intangible. You don&#39;t work to cultivate your food. You aren&#39;t afraid of dying, because of bad crops. Everyone is doing a lot better than before. That makes us bored and we search for a way to pass the time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also thr fact that people don&#39;t really matter anymore. In the old days you used to be the village cobbler or shoemaker or something. Now you&#39;re just a someone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, that&#39;s a huge plus over earlier times. At least in general. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there is so much of &quot;news&quot; to &quot;choose from&quot; that the media can feed you (I mean everybody) a lot of distraction, at least in the short term. And that may be enough for hiding some activities until the outcome is cast in concrete. Think about PIPA/SOPA, TTIP, the CIA spying activities that include &quot;by accident&quot; Americans, too, while foreigners have no say anyway, all police interests in installing backdoors in encryption methods and whatnot. (&lt;- and these are only example within the area I may have a clue about and/or some interest in).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now, there is less violence, wars and domestic, than at any other point in history. People were living longer and longer lives until a rash of suicides, cancers, and drug addictions beset boomers. More people than ever have access to clean drinking water and live in an area without open sewage. The least amount of people starve to death. We can technically feed, house, and clothe everyone on Earth, but the preventative madness there is the profit motive. People alive now are least likely to die of preventable illness, even in so-called developing countries.</p>

<p>There are more slaves alive now than ever before, so that&#39;s a big mark in the madness column. There is plenty of pollution and chemical poisoning, but that&#39;s been going on for many centuries. At least, there are attempts to stop and regulate mass poisoning and pollution. </p>

<p>For the majority of history, kings lived worse than you do today, rarely making it into their 30s and most of their children died before their teens. Check out &quot;A Brief History of Humankind&quot; on coursera or any of professor  Yuval Harari&#39;s talks , articles, or his book by the same name. Or take literally any course on History, Anthropology or Historical Sociology. As primitive as things are now, they are not devolving but rapidly advancing and you are boundlessly luckier than any of your ancestors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not alone. First go to <a href="/r/im14andthisisdeep/new/">/r/im14andthisisdeep/new/</a> to give you some perspectives about what others are saying. </p>

<p>Now what I&#39;m about to write are my own thoughts, so here goes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, you&#39;re absolutely right. We&#39;re all being overworked, and have less time to do things that we want to do. </li>
<li>Our financial system runs on fiat (by decree) currencies, which is not <strong><em>real</em></strong> money (wealth). </li>
<li>We&#39;re all made to be indebted (enslaved), and by the time we retire we&#39;re either having huge medical issues, or still trying to pay off debts until the day we die. </li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s like that old saying <strong><em>&quot;To stop and smell the roses.&quot;</em></strong> It&#39;s true. We&#39;re being spun around and around, always kept so <strong><em>&quot;busy, busy, busy&quot;</em></strong>, but we don&#39;t stop to reflect what&#39;s happening not only in our lives, but in the world around us. I find meditation helps me focus to reflect upon my life and my surroundings. </p>

<p>I feel there is an evil force out there that is battling with our good nature in order to corrupt it, for the purposes of ruining this world. To what ends is debatable. Is it a dark entity that is getting back at the Creator (i.e. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure all your creations are destroyed by my will because I&#39;m right and you&#39;re wrong!&quot;), or is it simply man&#39;s lust for greed &amp; power because they&#39;re blinded by ignorance &amp; hatred for other people/races? </p>

<p>Aside from the above, I do not feel we are living our lives to our most fullest potential. Do you take photography? You know why cameramen use tripods? Because no matter how uneven the ground is, all three points will more or less make your camera/video-recorder balanced when you&#39;re ready to take your shot. The three points in our lives have been always <strong>Mind, Body, and Spirit</strong>. Once one of those 3 are out of whack then we&#39;re not living our lives as we should be. </p>

<p>So I have friends who are <strong><em>&quot;addicted&quot;</em></strong> to sports, gambling, constant hunting, fishing, gaming, partying, etc. But take that all away, and I see them as being alone or lonely. They don&#39;t know what to do in their lives. <strong>I do feel we all need some past times or hobbies to keep ourselves grounded in life</strong>, however, we also need to communicate with one another, love ourselves, and care for each other (and Mother Earth). </p>

<p>So I get the whole &quot;addicted&quot; thing you were talking about. In fact, I have spoken to some &quot;friends&quot; of mine who don&#39;t want to know what&#39;s going on in the world (yes, it is true!), and that they just want to live their lives to the fullest (and not give a damn to some poor sap in Timbuktu). Ignorance is bliss, right? <strong>WRONG!</strong> It makes them shallow and cold. Without empathy then this world&#39;s toast. </p>

<p>For sure, lots of people seem to have some mental health problems. No matter how good they look in the mirror, or how financially wealthy they are, there&#39;s always something missing from their hearts. </p>

<p>Arm yourself with Knowledge, and the truth will set you free. <strong><em>You are not alone! You are precious to this world as much as everyone else is. Don&#39;t give up, and work hard, be honest, and be helpful to others.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/u/SayingStuffOnReddit">/u/SayingStuffOnReddit</a> how&#39;s it going? I noticed you deleted your comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip</strong> for you in the future is to <strong><em>not shame people with that stupid subreddit</em></strong>. Kinda <strong><em>ruins your entire post</em></strong> and makes <strong><em>you look like a gigantic cocksucker.</em></strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For real? Seriously? Wow, talk about immaturity &amp; ignorance all rolled up into one bundle of pride &amp; joy. Sheesh... </p>

<p>I gave <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a> my own thoughts, and thought I&#39;d show her a subreddit that has some funny &amp; insightful memes. I could have told her to go to several other subreddits, for the purposes of cheering her up. For example, there&#39;s always <a href="/u/UpLiftingNews">/u/UpLiftingNews</a> but I sent her one in the context that would help her not feel isolated and/or alone. </p>

<p>It&#39;s my own business if I wish to tell her that or not, and she can be the judge if she likes that subreddit and/or my decision of sending her that info. It&#39;s also up to <strong><em>her</em></strong> to decide whether my post is relevant or not. </p>

<p><strong><em>How was I shaming her with that subreddit!?</em></strong> You don&#39;t explain yourself, so you belittle yourself in the process by writing that out. You don&#39;t give clear examples, so how is it that you think my entire post is ruined because I shared that with her, as well as makes me look like a <strong>g.c.?</strong> In particular, how am I <strong><em>shaming her</em></strong> by sharing a subreddit like that? They&#39;re not all stupid memes you know. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve dealt with a lot of people on this subreddit, but I&#39;ve kept quiet for some time due to the fact that I have to deal with individuals like yourself. I get tired of dealing with idiots. </p>

<p>My purpose to just share my own experiences, as well as be helpful in the process. If you don&#39;t like it, you have to right to say what you want to say, and I have the right to dislike what you say based on the fact that you show no evidence on the contrary that I am causing harm or shame to <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a>, and I especially can&#39;t fathom why you think I look like a g.c. Talk about rude and immature... </p>

<p>And thus I end this conversation with saying to you &quot;Have a nice day and/or remaining work week&quot;, and good day to you. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a> was even kind enough to give <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/49clzd/does_anybody_else_think_society_has_gone_mad_read/d0rdmcq?context=3"><strong>her thoughts</strong></a> regarding about your now deleted comment. As she says, you can&#39;t please &#39;em all. :\</p>

<p>But &quot;real&quot; life doesn&#39;t work by the rules of immediate gratification, and buying that new toy will make you happy immediately,  but you&#39;ll buy the next toy a month later and repeat the cycle. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve started meditating a few years ago, which has really helped my mindfulness in regards to this phenomena.  It&#39;s hard,  but I now know not to buy that new toy because I&#39;ll be sick of it in a week, will have wasted money on it, and I won&#39;t be ultimately satisfied.</p>

<p>From this routine,  I have found that I personally find &quot;true&quot; satisfaction from being creative and making/designing stuff.  Instead of buying some technical widget I&#39;m going to be bored of in a month, I am trying to design my own technical widget that I can sell to make money.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Life isn&#39;t about the grind, and you need to learn that personally; easy way or hard way.  Grind to live, don&#39;t live to grind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the beginning of the end was 9/11/2001. Our consciousness was purposely messed with, and its even more apparent now. Yet there&#39;s still a faction of people that refuse to accept that as normal and are convinced that something isn&#39;t quite right. This election in the US is super polarized right now, and frankly a lot of white supremacists have come out of the woodwork because Trump &quot;speaks his mind&quot;. It&#39;s absolutely disgusting, and is such a step back in human progress. (you ever read the comments on the conservative FB pages? Some sick shit, man)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are spot on, and I don&#39;t think the situation you described can be fixed. Maybe it can, but I&#39;m middle-aged and cynical and surrounded people wallowing in the stupidest possible addictions—pain pills, alcohol, benzos, gambling, televised sports, television in general, cigarettes, meth, methadone, eating disorders, overeating.... the list goes on and on. It&#39;s repulsive and tragic, yet they are superficially happy when a well-written mass market comedy like Modern Family lands a clever joke. The sublime joy of nature has been replaced by a synthetic-fiber couch constructed on the other side of the world, shipped here in containers, and placed at great cost in front of a glowing rectangle. Fine, whatever.</p>

<p>I sank myself into a slew of addictions by my late teens, and spent my 20s breaking them. That&#39;s kept me fairly clean ever since. Today I have a moderate Internet addiction that I actively manage, but other than that, think I&#39;ve stayed pretty far away from the abyss. Two books that I read in my youth helped.</p>

<p>The first was &quot;Your Money or Your Life,&quot; or, personal finance for hippies. It points out the addictions in your life and forces you to confront why you overeat and overspend on various &quot;gazingus pins.&quot; Read it while you&#39;re young.</p>

<p>The other was a silly pre-hipster hipster book called &quot;The Book of the Subgenius.&quot; It&#39;s a bit pretentious and tedious, and describes a satirical religion that formed in NYC back when NYC was cool. What stuck with me was the idea of &quot;pinks,&quot; or normal people, who are predictable, addictable, and easily manipulated. Now, it&#39;s wrong to manipulate people, and since I&#39;m not particularly clever would probably backfire. But simply thinking of myself as a &quot;non pink,&quot; as someone who only wears fashionable clothes to trick pinks into thinking I&#39;m one of them, rather than because my self image relies on being fashionable, made life infinitely easier and more rewarding. Addictions seem like a trap, not an invitation, to which the pinks fall prey. Of course, I keep in mind a proverb (maybe Persian?) that I heard once: &quot;Just because you know the snake is poisonous doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t bite you.&quot; So it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to subscribe to Netflix without preparing for the potential possibility of addiction. </p>

<p>Good luck! There is still beauty in the world, and plenty of people who refuse to be pink. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An excellent book on addiction is Bruce K Alexander&#39;s &quot;Globalization of Addiction: A Study in Poverty of the Spirit,&quot; but it&#39;s long, expensive, and difficult to find at libraries around here, anyway. His once revolutionary thesis is basically  that people become addicted because they are cut off from meaningful social connections. The reason why AA is fairly successful, in his hypothesis, isn&#39;t because alcoholism is a sickness you need to confront every day with the help of a higher power, but because it provides a new group of friends with whom you can connect. He believes this widespread disconnection is structural (big houses, big roads, lack of public transport), cultural (small families, moving around throughout life, segmentation into grades by public schools, segmentation into cubicles at work), pathological (abusive relationships in a culture that favors individuality, narcissism, punishment, etc), and technological (hey Reddit).</p>

<p>Anyway, there are lots of reviews and synopses of the book online, and another addiction researcher, Johann Hari, has reached similar conclusions. I haven&#39;t read his book, but his Ted Talk has the Cliff&#39;s Notes: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY9DcIMGxMs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY9DcIMGxMs</a></p>

<p>As far as an actionable means of fighting addiction based on this particular thesis? Simply adding a daily dose of &quot;psychosocial integration&quot; to your to-do list might be helpful. Basically, having one human-to-human interaction, outside your normal circle, and without an addictive chemical or social lubricant, every day, might help stave off the addictive impulse more than all the vapes and patches and gums Big Pharmacy can sell you. This might not be as important for young people, who tend to socialize more easily but face different challenges (such as recovering from an abusive childhood where the parents had no idea they were being abusive), but for middle-aged people facing addiction issues I think it&#39;s crucial. We haul our aching bodies onto that couch, and the glowing rectangle becomes our window on a bright and beautiful world of social interaction. But we don&#39;t know Gloria or whatever the blonde wife&#39;s name is, we don&#39;t have close, healthy, infinitely clever family relationships with them. Because they aren&#39;t real. And before we allow that realization to touch our socially starved brain, we&#39;ll seek to numb it with a drink or....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my recent personal experience I&#39;d say that it is because we need stimulation to be happy but most of our stimulants these days are the emotional equivalent of sugar: empty calories.</p>

<p>I have an absolutely adorable 2 year old granddaughter,  and she is the happiest soul I&#39;ve ever had the privilege to know.  And I find myself looking at her in wonder and a little sadness, knowing that the happiness will fade, and I try to work out how to prevent that or delay it.   I think the answers are actually fairly simple.</p>

<p>She is always learning.  The joy on her face when she strings 3 words together and realises that she has been understood.  Her curiosity as she tries to figure out how the world hangs together.   Her passion  for music and movement.   She loves nothing quite so much as just being outside and finding the one flower in the middle of the yard.  </p>

<p>She plays games of her own invention incessantly.  Most recently, she has taken to standing in her toy box and laughing because she can&#39;t see her &#39;toesies&#39;</p>

<p>Sitting safely with me or her mother or my wife or any of the dozen other people in her life who basically queue up for the honour of reading a book to her.</p>

<p>The simple fact that she is always greeted with  smiles and hugs - people are overjoyed to see her and she instantly reciprocate. </p>

<p>And most importantly,  her utter naivety.   She doesn&#39;t read the papers.  Or reddit. </p>

<p>We grow up and abandon simple pleasures as we become more sophisticated,  but we still have the same needs.  But our need to learn is met by BS tabloid newspapers and network TV, and our need for company is met through the familiar faces on sitcoms, and our need to interact with the world is fed through reddit and video games.</p>

<p>And when none of that works, hey, there&#39;s always drugs.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll never get that back.  But you can approximate it.  Get out and go for a walk or a drive, just for the hell of it.  Take a camera as it will force you to actively look for something new.  Create something - draw, play an instrument,  but make it your mission to improve a little each day.  Greet EVERYBODY as if you are genuinely thrilled to see them.  Grab headphones, turn out the lights, lie down and listen to Dark Side of The Moon.  And finally,  realise that awareness of issues for the sake of being aware is just a slippery slope on the way to depression.   If there is a social justice issue that really bothers you, find a way to make a tangible difference.  Otherwise, try to put it to the side.  I&#39;ve spent way too many hours commenting on issues that don&#39;t directly affect me in any way whatsoever.  No, I don&#39;t want to be totally ignorant of world affairs, but on the other hand, the world wouldn&#39;t be affected one bit if I simply tuned out for a year and ignored posts regarding gun control,  anti-vaxxers, GMO, the refugee crisis, or US elections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but. Sure, the more you learn about life and the world, the more you realize that your fellow humans have devised a multitude of traps and pitfalls to enslave you and your peers. Some run their traplines for the monetary rewards, others do it for power, others for a host of other misguided reasons. Many do it, because they learned their way of life by training from their parents, and their training made sure no alternative worldview would make any sense to them. Organized crime families have far less sophistication and maniplulative power than many of the more respected, yet no less domineering, ways that virtual enslavement subcultures perpetuate their existence into successive generations by taking advantage of family ties. With hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of competitive subcultures, all set to hustle their victims as prey, the world becomes a dangerous place full of lures for the unsuspecting. Just think of the countless generations of humans who have preceded us and how cunning and wit have combined with expert knowledge of their prey to devise ever more enticing lures, so well camouflaged that many prey cannot detect the trap until too late and they become ensnared by whatever cocktail of addictions that particular trap relies on to turn its victims into slaves.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> have courage and do not lose hope. There remain some wise ones who have managed to live their lives without ever getting trapped. Others have managed to escape from some traps. Many work diligently to find new ways to help the trapped to become more aware of their obvious or invisible snares and set themselves free. </p>

<p>Who knows how many generations must come and go before all of humanity becomes wise enough to train its youth to avoid the traps devised by their fellow humans. Many of those traplines first began many generations ago, yet the designs of the trap makers work so well, that their traps still function well in our time. We need countermeasures devised to help those trapped to find their way to freedom. Only then, can all of humanity escape the insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is it. I&#39;m 18, about 8 months into the world of work. I&#39;ve done 50 hour weeks, I&#39;ve done 8 hour weeks. Some part of me keeps thinking that maybe I&#39;m missing something. Work feels tedious, but healthy in some ways. In my own small bubble, I know distractions are necessary to keep depressing thoughts away, and I know when I have too much time to myself I feel free, but depressed. But I never applied that thought to a worldwide scale. Maybe everyone is on some level, either brainwashed by superficial hobbies or occupations, or depressed/insane/bored, and blaming themselves for their own unhappiness. Not many people are utilising the free time to its best advantage. And in some ways, they can&#39;t, because they don&#39;t have any power to dramatically change anything anyway.</p>

<p>Maybe life does just consist of distractions. Even reflecting on yourself doesn&#39;t help. Animals are always distracted by the lower sections of Maslows hierarchy of needs. Maybe we just need to make sense of the rest of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a headstart in highschool because I didn&#39;t really try to meet people, or study that much. It gave me enough time to reflect on myself and get past that &quot;teenage depression&quot; stage of things before high school ended. I mean I still felt depressed, but I felt like I had some control over it, and making the decision to distract myself, whether it was meeting new people in year 10 (9th grade), or playing video games with other new people, helped me quite a lot.</p>

<p>I like to think that as I grow up, I&#39;ll find at least one consistent hobby to distract myself, even if it&#39;s as simple as going for a walk. Self-reflection is good, it&#39;s a sign of a healthy mind. In my opinion, if you can criticise yourself before you judge others, you&#39;re already more intelligent than most of us. But too much of it is work in itself. So essentially, I think distractions are necessary, even if they aren&#39;t that healthy. Too much of either mind-numbing hobbies, or healthy self-reflection, can be really bad for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this post blew up and I&#39;m late to the party but I&#39;ve experienced this shift myself. The past year or so has been a true awakening for me, and I&#39;m glad others are experiencing the same thing. </p>

<p>While I&#39;m still addicted to the Internet, tv, and distraction just like everyone else I&#39;m doing my best to shift my focus towards more educational materials. Actually studying the systems and entities that make up this world. </p>

<p>Ultimately my hope is that by accepting we all have a problem and identifying it then hopefully a small minority of us can do something about it in the future. </p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m basically just buying time until the boomers become too senile to take care of themselves so the rest of us can make our move and start nudging the world in other directions. </p>

<p>It seems more and more people are waking up and I think that we all have distractions and that&#39;s OK.</p>

<p>However on some levels it is getting to a point where people can&#39;t be alone with their thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I&#39;m lucky, maybe I&#39;m naiive.  Early in career (&lt;5years), grew up on Religion, Christian, if that matters to you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But society now says, &quot;Do whatever makes you superficially happy because that&#39;s all that matters!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something that church&#39;s have been preaching against for a long time.  And I think there is a lot of young adults (&lt;30) that grew up in church, and just said fuck it, and did what they want.  I am perfectly content with my current life, a life I live, and the way I interact with the surrounding world.  My friends my coworkers, my family.  </p>

<p>Has society change, I&#39;d imagine so.  It must have, the world is much more interconnected than before.  Do our lives look boring compared to TV and movies?  Of course, they the most exciting points of a person&#39;s life in a year and compresses it to hours. Do I enjoy seeing what others are up to?  No.  But I understand those who do.  I&#39;m always on the if you aren&#39;t enjoying/contempt/living your life, do something to change it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a mix of responses I feel when I read this. On one hand, everything has always sucked. There&#39;s been feudalism, the Spanish Inquisition, the Bubonic Plague, worldwide wars, exploitation, torture and slavery throughout human history. There&#39;s usually an arrogant, self centered, non-compassionate elite and a bottom class that makes up the majority. </p>

<p>A lot of the &quot;oh 50 years ago things were great&quot; comments I am reading stem from the fact that propaganda was better then so people could believe they were great and just and all, but the Western world was very much involved in imperialism, exploitation and genocide since it started.  The current disillusionment people have today might originate with the  realization within the information age, that we are part of that existence, because now all these facts can bubble to the surface with this global communications platform. The other main cultural dissatisfaction stems from the growing realization that we now actually have the means technologically to pretty much end the daily toil for basic subsistence for the masses for the first time in Human History. (this article sums it up better than I could, <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18817_5-reasons-future-will-be-ruled-by-b.s..html">http://www.cracked.com/article_18817_5-reasons-future-will-be-ruled-by-b.s..html</a>)</p>

<p>With all that said, on a metaphysical level, the Buddha spoke that everyone is always suffering due to the nature of Mind and Ego.  Basically the ego is in a state where it wants to &quot;get comfortable&quot; and always looks to the <em>next thing</em> to get comfortable. It&#39;s too hot, so go outside in the snow; too cold, so go back in to sit by the fire, its like we are constantly dissatisfied and have desire for anything but what we are doing.  So, the state of existence is this suffering, suffering at what we don&#39;t have. Suffering when we have stuff because we&#39;re afraid we&#39;ll lose it.  Just constant disatisfaction.  The go to, of course is to worry about the future, regret the past or have idealistic visions of some undreamt of future where things are better or wax poetic about a past that is idealized.  </p>

<p>Ceding those things, people tend to run to distractions to avoid that suffering.  Which are the compulsions and &quot;addictions&quot; you spoke of.  Here is a link that shows this idealized past has been pined over through many generations with basically every generation having their variant of &quot;kids these days...&quot; <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/52209/15-historical-complaints-about-young-people-ruining-everything">http://mentalfloss.com/article/52209/15-historical-complaints-about-young-people-ruining-everything</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the parameters of the discussion are a bit broad. </p>

<p>With regard to the world as a whole, exploited workers were always there. There was always extreme poverty within half of the world since the dawn of colonialism. There was genocide and butchering of people from the rise of reactionary regimes throughout South America to the west sponsoring of &quot;Fighting Communism&quot; in Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. If you lived in any of the cultures of the Middle Eastern or Russian totalitarian regimes you would realize the last century wasn&#39;5 all wine and roses. Being an African American in the last 100 years you might have realized that the &quot;free democracy&quot; wasn&#39;t exactly free.</p>

<p>On a more macro level, my contention is the Mind has always caused grasping, delusion, suffering, attachment, seeking for anything other than present along with waxing poetic about a past that was golden or a future that is better after some big change. Alternatively that expresses as morbid reflection on the past or worry about some even worse future. </p>

<p>So with all that established, I will make the assumption that by your thesis &quot;Society has gone mad&quot; you generally mean &quot;mid century middle class white Americans and their descendants are acting delusional and have experienced a huge cultural shift.&quot; In that case, I would 100% agree. 
In that case, yes, extreme changes have occurred in the last thirty years. The concentration of wealth and power has gotten extremely imbalanced compared to the 1950s-1970s due to the successful rise of neoliberal fascism with it&#39;s destruction of labor powers and global trade acts and &quot;trickle down economics&quot; policies.  The &quot;information revolution&quot; has been a double edged sword in allowing a lot of the &quot;hidden truths&quot; to reach a broader audience while also serving to alienate and anesthetize the general public with cat memes and content filtering bubbles within mediums such as Google and Facebook. The general public has not the tools, community cohesion or critical thinking to quite understand what is happening societally. &quot;No one has told them&quot; this is the case as the Authority with which they inform their worldview has kept silent on the matter (television and mainstream journalism). So as the wealth levels out with their overseas brethren and  the economy slowly rolls off a cliff they know something is very very wrong but can&#39;t put a finger on it and they numb out with distractions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Howl by Alan Ginsberg, is a meaningful portrait of techno-industrial society. Like a vision of the present by a prophet of the past who had first seen such as we see every day. Sometimes here and now in moments of sanity, can see glimpses of it in the same light.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/179381">http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/179381</a></p>

<p>What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?
Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!
Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!
Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!
Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!
Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!
Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!
Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!
Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!
They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!
Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!
Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!
Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!
Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street! </p>

What I feel you are referring to is cognitive dissonance.
There is something wrong and we do find crutches and vices to cope with it. However knowing this isn&#39;t a bad thing. If more people were self aware and honest to themselves then we all would have a larger and more active voice to find the reality in what we call life. Keep on the path my friend. We are all students here on a journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find solstice in the islands of humanity... The inner goodness of each individual seeking love rather than mere satisfaction. Those, like yourself, searching for a higher meaning. The reality is that the world, the universe and the self-containing micro-cosms everywhere each hold so much mystery and wonder that there is hope if not assured certainty that this childish phase of humanity will pass as quickly as it arrived and the trend will begin to swing the other way... And then back again... It is important to be able to self-reflect, compose your thoughts and make positive change, even if that change is small or gradual, and I think you&#39;re entirely right, things like this aren&#39;t typically celebrated in our current circumstance, at least on a massive scale. To put it succintly, that&#39;s a problem. Some will say that &#39;seeing is believing&#39; but I contend that &#39;believing is achieving&#39; and with that attitude, that mindset, the darkest of overlords and intentions will become powerless against your superior kung-fu. Essentially, a childish, beginner phase is just as important as reaching maturity or even wisdom, but the time or careless disregard needs to be observed, remembered and reflected upon to make use of it. Just the same, the master is the one who truly realizes how much more there is to learn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks... Its not exactly hopeful in that the process never ends, and eternity can seem daunting. I have to remind myself not to give up on the big picture. Giving up can be useful for things like drinking beer (which I need to do... Again). Its crazy how people will hold on to a wrong idea just because they think that feeling they did wrong is the same as doing the wrong thing, so it is best to ignore both feeling and doing and carry on as it &#39;always has been&#39;. Culture can be dandy or it can be astonishingly backwards sometimes.</p>

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieve it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

<p>Hilariously I feel as if people are more mindless now, than when they had only TV (the idiot box)and Newspapers to get their information from.  People take website articles as gospel now.  I&#39;m not sure if its that comment sections act as opinion reinforcing mechanic. (Well if so many agree, it must be true)  Collectivism and Truth through popular opinion?</p>

<p>Even though now we have the internet, which had the possibility to revolutionize education, society and democracy.  It&#39;s being eaten up now by corporations and interests that wish to feed a one-world-view to people.  Discussion and debate is censored or outright banned on most websites now, including here.</p>

<p>Everything you and others have mentioned have just screamed to me: shut up, work, consume, and make us another generation of the same. If you don&#39;t, well we have some immigrants and Visa workers coming in.</p>

<p>And I agree there is no time for people to reflect.  If you aren&#39;t working, your on your phone on your way somewhere, or your drunk, or fucking, or on your phone again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No -- in fact, other than the MIC/Intelligence Complex and the wealthy, I think that the nation is holding on.</p>

<p>I do think however that there has been a great effort since the assassination of JFK to portray a very violent society and to make us fear each other -- 
The fake Drug War is one way -- 
Using TV for every growing violence is another -- 
(See:  Every Day - movie with Helen Hunt and Liev Schrieber -
there&#39;s a subs story about the father which is unappealing and may have been put there to discourage viewing.  The main story deals with a writer and what he&#39;s being asked to do every day -
create every increasingly violent and outrageous story lines.
The other night I was cruising channels near Showtime&#39;s movies 
or series near there -- and I came upon a man threatening a woman who was on the floor near him.  I noticed the title was something about the &quot;burning.&quot;  The outline was something to do with a guy who was unhappy his g/f had cheated on him and ...&quot;
Back to the scene, he is threatening her with a book of matches -- perhaps I missed that he had doused her with some flammable substance/? -- and then he threw the book of matches at her.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also cite the many &quot;events&quot; we are seeing -- 
I think most of them have been contrived -- faked -- 
I don&#39;t know how many of  you here may be familiar with Mae Brussel but she was untangling these events long ago and predicting more.
Mae Brussel can be found on YouTube -- MaeBrussel playlist
or otherwise on the internet.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the David Berkowitz &quot;Son of Sam&quot; terrorizing of NYC one summer.  How many knew that he actually volunteered for Vietnam -- and then later became a conscientious objector?
He was then jailed and pretty much terrorized by the military.</p>

<p>How about the Charles Manson?  A little old to be a hippie and used to smear the youth movement?  No real deaths?
A military operation?  A man who spent much of his life in prison.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here with the Sanders supporters -- will take a look around.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found my way away from addiction. I&#39;ve noticed it in myself and everyone else somewhere around the age of 16 which started with porn/masturbation so I joined no fap. Then alcohol/cigarettes/sex. Videogames/TV/phone have also been dropped off. I did have to go to rehab basically since new years (my po put a warrant out for me then I sat in jail for three weeks, then rehab for 28 days).</p>

<p>Coming out, we moved into a fifth wheel a day before I was arrested. This means I live &quot;isolated&quot; surrounded by other people like me. I wake up, check Reddit for info. Go walk my dog, run, lift, work. But my attachments have leveled off so much. Via meditation and removal of these things I feel free again. Now for others, I&#39;m not so sure. Here on this forum, sure, we&#39;ll pretty much all see it. Personally, I&#39;m basically only interested in girls that don&#39;t have a Facebook and aren&#39;t attached to their phones. Much less negative outside influence.</p>

<p>Personally I think it&#39;s pretty hard to make friends not attached too much. Haven&#39;t found many but I won&#39;t give up working on myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m both happy and sad to see you&#39;ve come to much the same conclusions as I have over the past few years. All around me I see addicts who if they don&#39;t get their fix - mostly smartphone use, games, TV, Internet, and even far too much food, then all hell threatens to break loose. Each one would be fine in balance but we&#39;re far off balance. </p>

<p>Or, at least we are in the US. I&#39;m not originally from here but I&#39;m going to grad school in Boston and only started to feel this way about the world when I moved here. I can&#39;t say for sure if I&#39;d have eventually felt the same in Toronto, however it was a lot easier to talk to my friends about these kinds of ideas back there. It probably helps that a bunch of them can and have voluntarily given up their phones, drugs, TV for different periods either to get perspective or to focus better on school. Maybe I just knew weirdos back home. </p>

<p>If I even mention the idea of addiction and mass distraction to people in my program I get told that I don&#39;t know how to have any fun, or that its not a pleasant thing to talk about so let&#39;s not talk about that. Uggh. For a city so smart there&#39;s not many to have an intelligent conversation with if your ideas go against what media and society says are normal. I&#39;ve been without a working cell phone here for a while months ago and it really convinced me that people are addicted. Can&#39;t go 10 minutes without checking their phones. I try my best now to use my phone as an actual phone, and a computer only a few times a day but it is damn hard and I am likely addicted too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a very clear case of projection- seeing in society what you struggle with in yourself. I&#39;ve heard the same argument made by many people with self control issues. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have good self control, everything looks like an addiction. Self control takes a lot of work. People have always struggled to find a balance.  Conquer this in yourself and then see how you view society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not attacking you, OP.  I understand what you&#39;re saying and think that many of us are reactive to sensory overload.  We crave the stimulation and grow to rely on it, if simply out of habit.  There&#39;s so much novelty that we have access to finding the entertainment to get those neurotransmitters flowing is VERY accessible.</p>

<p>There have been some interesting study showing aptitude and motivation to forgo short term pleasure in favor of long term benefit and I&#39;d argue that those with more stability in their lives tend to have more foresight in their habits- if only because they can afford to learn this trait.  Some of us are more prone to being impulsive and seeking instant rewards.  </p>

<p>I used to look at how mankind has arranged the world and think, this is not how humans should live!</p>

<p>Life should be better, for all of us, but we keep repeating the same mistakes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently found solace in Absurdism. Here, <a href="http://dbanach.com/sisyphus.htm">read Camus on Sysiphus</a>, for example. </p>

<p>Every day we push some rock or another, up a hill, in order to survive. I don&#39;t know how many of us are aware of our plight, maybe it comes and goes (or we dismiss it as in Wh1teCr0w&#39;s &quot;Welcome to the Grind&quot;) but we are on a treadmill. </p>

<p>We are born, we are taught to believe in constraints, if we&#39;re unlucky we wake up at some point and ask &quot;what&#39;s it this all for!&quot; and then, poof, we&#39;re gone.</p>

<p>Best enjoy whatever your rock is, or at least enjoy whatever pushing the rock gets you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a mid-lifer now, everything I do is a bit more dear than when I was young and had faith in the illusion. I get it now. Just enjoy the shit out of everything you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t invest too much energy raging over the injustices of the world, it is a waste of energy and solves nothing. </p>

<p>Rather, pick a small thing that you can influence, and change, for the better. Plant trees, clean up a public beach, take pound puppies for walks, whatever floats your boat.</p>

<p>Emily Dickinson got it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IF I can stop one heart from breaking,</p>

<p>I shall not live in vain;</p>

<p>If I can ease one life the aching,</p>

<p>Or help one fainting robin</p>

<p>Unto his nest again,   </p>

<p>I shall not live in vain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That, and realize that tribe-making is important. Find your people, the people who &quot;get you&quot; and live the same life ethos as you. Find them and support each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Western society is insane. How do we know? It is trying to commit suicide. Its leaders are flooding Western white Christian nations with non-whites who can&#39;t speak the languages, don&#39;t know the customs and don&#39;t want to learn them, hate the white race and hate Christians, and have no intention of finding a real job or working for a living. We as Westerners are doing this to ourselves, and if anyone criticizes this suicidal behavior, they are called names and shamed into silence.</p>

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
What did you dream? It&#39;s alright we told you what to dream.&quot;</p>

<p>-- Pink Floyd from Welcome to the Machine</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;Society&quot; as a whole hasn&#39;t gone mad, we just don&#39;t really know what to do with all of the &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;illusion&quot; in our culture (in the big picture).</p>

<p>We&#39;re all part of the same broken system, we can&#39;t seem to get &quot;past&quot; the superficial you speak of, the meaningless, the blah.  </p>

<p>But on the rare occasion someone does get past it, past the &quot;madness&quot; that artificial culture creates ... it&#39;s hard to stay past it, to not get sucked back into meaningless consumerism, culture of illusion, and superficial tourism stuff.</p>

<p>The Machine doesn&#39;t stop running because you finally get enlightened.  In fact, it works much like quicksand, the more you struggle to break free ... the more you sink into it.</p>

<p>That creates the &quot;mad society&quot; you alluded to in your post, from my perspective anyhow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly, not an easy question is it? and that&#39;s the easy question, spice it up a bit and say your gender, social status, colour and sexuality will be determined randomly... can you even think of a single era of history you&#39;d want to live in?  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve idealised the past simply because you assume nothing could be worse than it is now, this is not the case - humanity has been working tirelessly to better itself for millennia, and we&#39;re still working on it -- <em>All beings so far have created something beyond themselves. Do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, and revert back to the beast rather than overcome mankind? What is the ape to a man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just so shall a man be to the Overman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame. You have evolved from worm to man, but much within you is still worm. Once you were apes, yet even now man is more of an ape than any of the apes.</em></p>

<p>As wonderful as it the Merry Ol&#39;days might look when viewed from afar read some Dickens, Hardy, Shakespeare, etc and get an idea of the strife folk suffered daily - make that question from before even easier - which Dickens character would you want to be? which Hardy character? which Shakespeare character? pick the sex, race and social position yourself and you still won&#39;t find a life better than the modern developed world. Take Romeo, living in a world where the idea of him choosing his own wife is a scandal, where unchaperoned meetings are a crime and justice is entirely arbitrary and delivered from the back of a white steed... This was the idealised world of the late middle age of western society, as brutal and awful as it is it&#39;s nothing compared to the actual reality of the times - the squalor in the cities and the absurdities of the social system would be absolutely unbearable to us, but it was getting better two hundred and fifty years before less than half the male population were freemen the rest having no control of their lives - would you want to to time travel back to a world where you only have a fifty-fifty chance of having any self autonomy? no, well it&#39;s not fifty-fifty anyway of course because there was already the chance you&#39;d be a woman... and if you did happen to get the lucky card of being an affluent male you&#39;re tightly bound to your Lord, and if you&#39;re one of the few hundred truly powerful people then you&#39;re incredibly lucky but still worse off in pretty much every way than the truly powerful people alive today... </p>

<p>So we can basically rule out that bit of history, and 1300 was much better than half a century before;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 7th-century Anglo Saxon &quot;Oath of Fealty&quot; states:  </p>

<p>By the Lord before whom this sanctuary is holy, I will to N. be true and faithful, and love all which he loves and shun all which he shuns, according to the laws of God and the order of the world. Nor will I ever with will or action, through word or deed, do anything which is unpleasing to him, on condition that he will hold to me as I shall deserve it, and that he will perform everything as it was in our agreement when I submitted myself to him and chose his will.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After fifteen hundred the Catholic autocracy gives way to the protestant reformations and counter-reformations which see the rise of Puritanism which made sexual acts things punishable by death and illicit thoughts even more so - it wasn&#39;t just that you couldn&#39;t be an atheist you had to have EXACTLY the right, and current, opinions on the faith, thus we see absolutely bizarre and brutally harsh systems develop across europe -- just seeming a bit jewish or someone saying they thought you were a heretic was enough to get you tortured, literally tortured to death just for disagreeing on a theological point or holding a different set of values... of course a lot of people fled to america because they didn&#39;t like the systems in the uk, they weren&#39;t any where near as severe enough - the puritans that founded america were brutally regressive and closed to new ideas, and there was NO freedom in america at this point, if you were caught travelling without the correct documentation and permits then you&#39;d be arrested and press-ganged, sometime even with a valid travel pass...</p>

<p>Then we start to get towards modern history which you have decided is rubbish, there&#39;s only one place left for you my friend - the future, let&#39;s make a better future for all to enjoy.</p>

Even if you think it&#39;s a crock of shit, most religions preach self control and moderation. There isn&#39;t anything wrong with sex, or food, or working. The problem is when you become consumed with something (religion for example lol). Generally speaking its not healthy to be obsessed with anything, even breathing... you&#39;ll pass out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homosapien has always been occupied with distractions: religion, the stars, the colosseum, politics, etc.</p>

<p>The remedy to this situation of self-avoidance is self-reflection... which ultimately leads to the development of compassion, and understanding.</p>

<p>Yet homosapien has been, for some time: ignorant to himself, and others. (Major Factors: apathy and limited starting points in the sentience category)</p>

<p>Homosapien should endeavour to develop his concentrative powers, and achieve harmony/unity/understanding with all through meditation. It&#39;s the solution to all of his ills, yet... he&#39;d rather complain about them than fix them.</p>

<p>Man is the monkey tribe which jumps around, hoots and hollers at the black pylon; not it&#39;s engineer.</p>

<p>We must see a pattern here to this development in sentience as a remedy for man. Yet the many monkey lot cry, &quot;Why am I here?!&quot; And they go looking for &quot;god&quot;, and not &quot;themselves&quot;.</p>

<p>So... distractions are constant, and will constantly appear, but they can be overcome: TRANSCENDED, through persistent mental training, meditation.</p>

<p>Man&#39;s plight is no different than that of every other life-form in the totality of existence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s now the norm for kids to be just as attached to their entertainment devices as their parents, kids no longer talk to each other or play outside. They just sit on their devices, brainwashed by the media from infancy.</p>

<p>Some of us were born early enough to see the introduction of increased use of technology and entertainment media (Television / Internet / Smart Phone / Social Media / Virtual Reality soon / etc.) but the newer generation won&#39;t know what it was like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are a sick society. IMO we are missing connection. A true connection not the ones we currently have with social media and the internet. No one has real friends any more or communication. Sadest thing that I encountered was earlier this year. Me and 6 friends got together for the first time in like 6 years. We have known each other for decades. Woke up one morning to come out to the living room. Everyone in the same room with their faces in phones. I have a phone but didn&#39;t have a smart phone at the time. I just sat there staring at em. Just was sad. I see that all over in restaurants and parks. People not really connecting and that is what I think the big prob is these days. We are inherently social creatures and we are missing out on that real physical connection these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you wholeheartedly, society today is very, very fickle.  The government keeps us busy with our jobs, there is no time to think, to meditate, to really see what&#39;s going on around us.  When we come home, we&#39;re tired, and we all turn on the tv and tune out.  </p>

<p>Our &#39;hobbies&#39; as we like to call them, are nothing more than a temporary distraction from our meaningless (not really, if you&#39;re a Christian), dull, and generally boring lives of working for the establishment.  Society tells you to enjoy life, to do whatever makes you happy, but it&#39;s only ever temporary.  As you said, addictions.  We only ever want more.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t fit into the hivemind, you are shamed and made fun of.  On Reddit, this consists of downvotes and bans.  Say the right thing, the currently accepted train of thought,  and you&#39;re patted on the back.  Again, on reddit, posts that fall in line with the general sheep of the world, and that meet the government&#39;s &#39;standards&#39;, are propelled to the front page.  Generally, they are &quot;feel good&quot;, happy posts that don&#39;t have a whole lot of meaning behind them.  Say something that society doesn&#39;t like, and the assholes of the world will close their ears and scream that you&#39;re wrong.  Denial, denial, denial.  They don&#39;t want to accept the truth and step out of their little, secure comfort zone.  Fucking pathetic, yet somewhat understandable.  Reddit has been invaded by the government, and they do their best to manipulate the truth, downvoting posts and banning Users as they go.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking of leaving Reddit, it is very annoying having all of my posts being downvoted just because my opinion is the unpopular one.  Also, if I post too much, I receive a message stating that &quot;you&#39;re doing that too much, try again in X minutes&quot;.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;d love nothing more than to spread the truth and talk with people here, but with all of the downvotes, sometimes I wonder if this shit&#39;s even worth it.</p>

<p>In America especially, your &#39;patriotism&#39; is called into question if you say anything that society, the media, and the establishment doesn&#39;t agree with.  Remember, the government wants nothing more than society to slip apart, if we can&#39;t join together to overthrow the establishment, we stand no chance of winning.  The media is the government&#39;s personal microphone, keeping people busy with whatever is popular at the time, and fearmongering folks into giving up their rights.   The media IS a brainwashing tool, have no doubts about it.  They train society on how to act and how to think.  Do you ever notice how much conspiracy theorists are made fun of in entertainment?  We&#39;re never taken seriously, we are the laughingstock of society.  It&#39;s a damn shame, we need to ban together and find a way to fix this, because the world is going to hell, and fast.</p>

<p>Sorry that this post is more of an essay than anything, I&#39;m just depressed at the current state of things, and pissed off.  I&#39;d love to PM, if you have the time</p>

<p>There are so many beautiful possibilities if we could mature more as a people, and less as a technology focused plutocracy.</p>

<p>Most days I feel as an alien walking amongst cattle, but fro mtime to time, you do run across other open-minded and thinking individuals. This is what gives me some small hope for fixing things, and making the future a place where my grand children can not just survive, but thrive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly I really started becoming aware of what was going on behind the scenes after 911. The way we are controlled by fear and kept distracted and separated by the media and other sources became very clear.  Then in 2008,  when the big corporations began getting bailouts and Obama was unable to keep promises and continued the cronyism going,  I really knew shit was wrong.  I just figured we must live in insanity, possibly hell for that matter.  Not to say I have lost all hope. Life is what you make it.  Just don&#39;t let their fear control you.  Try to bring people to the light gently and with good seed.  Change happens over many many lifetimes.  Maybe we just have to keep coming back, so in a third or fourth lifetime maybe the change we have tried to instill will actually mean something.  That and my kids are really all that keep me going.</p>

We live in a natural world with amazing processes that took billions of years to evolve and we are destroying that in the blink of an eye as far as time goes.  All these distractions have done well to help elites consolidate power and monetary wealth.  2008 they stole retirements and houses.  For the last 10 years its been easy money for student loans and no jobs.  This next bubble will be student loans, credit cards, and lousy derivitive investments.

<p>You still have a lot of growing up to do. So what if it is &quot;celebrated&quot;? Take control of your own life or you&#39;ll be in for lots of rude awakenings like, &quot;How can they let people do this when it&#39;s so unsafe?&quot; That stuff about people not realizing they are adults until it&#39;s too late... you gloss over it as &quot;yeah, yeah, obvious, ok&quot; until one day you (hopefully) realize you cam&#39;t just drift with the societal tide and assume everything must be fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty late, but as you said, it isn&#39;t too late to join the discussion, I&#39;d just like to share my point of view.</p>

<p>I grew up in a laid back, &quot;3rd world&quot; town where human values and relationships were one of the most important aspects in life. 2 years ago, thanks to job opportunities and advancement of my career, I moved to a different country, which had a very different work pace and life style. A modernized country with world class architecture, financial districts, and leading in technological applications.</p>

<p>I came with hopes and dreams beyond imagination. But as an alien just set foot into this new place, I noticed something. Zombies, zombies everywhere. Mindlessly marching to work, thoughtlessly marching home. The same routine each week, the same plans each year. And I, seemingly the only &#39;self-aware&#39; being that hasn&#39;t been assimilated into the mindless hive-mind, felt alone and afraid. Around me, I felt that people were just drudging their way to work without plans with their life, just wasting it away, and I was afraid I would turn into one of them, that I would forget my hopes, my dreams.</p>

<p>Soon, like you said, I grew an addiction. Games. Games were my alternate dimension where I spent 4 hours a day in. It removed me from this mindless environment where day in and day out I did the same thing. In the games, I made progress, I learned new things; In life, it seemed I didn&#39;t go anywhere. The game was soon to be my reality.</p>

<p>I missed the old life, where simple things meant more, and the price of something wasn&#39;t measured in currency. Today everybody is in the mad rush to work on something they don&#39;t like, to prove themselves, in order to earn more, and all for what? I do not understand.</p>

<p>As for me right now, I&#39;ve managed to find a tricky middle ground between work, play, and life. Coming from a different environment than I&#39;m in certainly helps keep my sanity in check and keeping what&#39;s important to me in view.</p>

<p>Yes, the society is mad, but I would rather die than be another one of those fools. And having seen your post, I know I am not alone with this thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no one solution. Mostly, people have to find their own way. Having friends and loved ones is pretty much the best addiction I&#39;ve found. For some people that&#39;s an easy solution, for many it is much more difficult. Difficult though it may be, it remains an ever-worthy endeavor. Some people just choose a vice over people because its something simpler to obtain and they believe that they are in control of it.  Drugs and vice are an escape, but so are hobbies and ambitions. The key as you say is balance. Try not to confuse balance with neutrality though. Doing nothing isn&#39;t balance. </p>

<p>If you want a way to make the world better, make as many positive connections with other people as you can; the more diverse your social circle the better. Don&#39;t just make the connections either, maintain them; that&#39;s the real challenge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This just sounds like more ego-centric nonsense mixed with some elements of distorted-truth to produce some hodgepodge conclusions.</p>

<p>People are fine, you are just focusing on the negative aspects.. try focusing on the causes of the negative aspects such as you mention drugs, therefore how does drug policy and availability factor in as opposed to simply referring to things as a &quot;shift in society&quot;.. some with food, how is food different today instead of causing it a &quot;shift in society&quot;.. same with entertainment, power, work, etc.. the things that are available today are things people will end up using due to it&#39;s availability.. people have always been just as out of control, nothing has changed, the environment changes, not people, we are products of our environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This is a mad society. There is absolutely no balance, and people have no measure of balance anymore. How do we measure normalcy is an insane world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a negative way of viewing society.  And you put the onus on the people and not the system they are a part of; their environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But society now says, &quot;Do whatever makes you superficially happy because that&#39;s all that matters!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this quote is a half-truth, I do hear people say &quot;Do what makes you happy!&quot; but I don&#39;t see spun with &quot;because that&#39;s all that matters!&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently had a panic attack, and I realized it was because I was overworking myself, but in our society that is celebrated. Overeat. Overwork. Overindulge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can understand getting overwhelmed and experiencing a panic attack, I&#39;ve had similar experiences and I&#39;ve spoken to various people who also get these kinds of feelings.. however, I don&#39;t think society celebrates it necessarily in the way you state it.  People are overworking either out of necessity or out of some compulsion to do so, and people are overeating and overindulging either simply due to the availability of things to overindulge in or in some cases they are compensating, such as overeating and getting pleasure from overeating in order to combat stress accrued from other aspects of their life.. I think this is all a product of our environment and social structure, not necessarily something we as individuals have a whole lot of control over unless we learn to govern ourselves in a balanced way or learn beneficial methods of dealing with stress.. unfortunately we don&#39;t always learn these things unless we learn it at a young age or deal with things in a proactive way early on when experiencing stress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody can cope with reality, so everybody has an addiction to choose from. Food? Drugs? Alcohol? Sex? Entertainment? Power? Work? You get the point. But I mean people are actually addicted, and they will justify their behaviors because is what society says is okay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everybody is addicted to something, sure, but these addictions are due to the availability of things.. and I would not suggest prohibition or policing of how much soda or cigarettes people can consume or what people can and can&#39;t spend money on.. we do need to have a more proactive approach to education early on that helps set the structure to allow people to cope with all this shit they will experience later in life.. none of this sort of stuff gets taught, we are pretty much thrown in and deal with it as best we can.</p>

<p>Guns absolutely have a place in war, where other people are actively trying to kill you with guns.  They have no place at your local McDonalds.

<p>You can appreciate the idea that America stands for while simultaneously hating the people that comprise it.  ISIS?  So I go from killing them to joining them?  That&#39;s quite the stretch.  I&#39;m going to assume I won&#39;t be very welcomed among them since I&#39;ve spent most of my life fighting them or organizations that are similar in nature.  They also aren&#39;t very anti-gun, in fact, I&#39;d wager they&#39;re probably even more pro-gun than you are.  So that idea is out.  </p>

<p>Can it with the call of duty rhetoric. I quit playing that series years ago because everything after COD4 is derivative garbage.</p>

<p>So just out of curiosity, do you have an &quot;I&#39;M TOTALLY NOT ANTIGUN!!!&quot; line for when people call out on your draconian stance on gun rights? Most of you people do.</p>

<p>Why should I NOT worry that people are going to take my guns (and vote accordingly) when you talk like that?</p>

We in America have Ford and Cheverolet that have cars that can go up to 150 MPH.  Yet our max speed limit is 75 MPH.  Now why would they do that?  Why? because if you take your car on a race track and hit the gas and go to 80, then 90 and then up to 100, you start freaking out because you feel like you are breaking the law even though you are allowed to go as fast as you want on that race track.   The mind is already trained not to do that and doesn&#39;t feel comfortable doing it.   This is the mechanism they use for all items.   Yes it&#39;s mad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are shockingly unhappy with their lives and do mindless things to escape from it. I don&#39;t blame them. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s their fault at all. I was very independent and interested in reading from the time I was very small. If I wasn&#39;t, the system would probably have me like it does everyone else.</p>

<p>The system sets you up to be part of society and doesn&#39;t bother to teach you that there are things <em>outside of that</em>. You know? You go from being a student to suddenly working 40 hours a week. You get tired. You eat what authorities tell you to eat because you think that&#39;s what is right, even if it ends up with you havning diabetes. That&#39;s why I think movements like paleo and ketogenic diets are interesting, for example. Here you have people saying &quot;no, you can&#39;t stay ketogenic for long&quot; (like my grad school biochem professor). Meanwhile you have people out there saying &quot;I can&#39;t, watch me.&quot; and staying in for 2+ years and fixing a ton of health issues.</p>

<p>I really enjoy watching underground movements buck the systems we have in place. There&#39;s hope out there. You just have to know where to look. And where to avoid. Unfortunately, I mostly avoid this sub because while there are independent thinkers here, there are a ton of crazies here as well. </p>

<p>You have to keep an open mind about things, but that <em>does not</em> mean you need to believe everything you hear that runs counter to popular opinion. In this very thread, I saw a guy link to a giant article on an iffy site about contrails. Not to derail the thread, but the sources in that article don&#39;t indicate even half of what they are claiming it does. This is coming from somebody with an M.S. in a STEM field.  </p>

<p>A healthy dose of skepticism is a good thing to have. You should always be skeptical of the official narrative and do your own research. But as soon as I start seeing people implying that airplanes are poisoning the entire world with aluminum as a New World Order population reduction plan, I have to roll my eyes. I really don&#39;t even know how this comment will be met. Maybe I&#39;ll be downvoted to hell or called a shill or something. But I don&#39;t buy that level of conspiracy at all. Not even close.</p>

<p>Edit: Take Monsanto for instance. And let&#39;s utilize Occam&#39;s Razor. What&#39;s more likely: That they are just a bunch of greedy idiots who don&#39;t see the implications of some of the genetic modifications they do OR that they are a shadowy nefarious organization working for the NWO specifically trying to destroy the ecosystem and control the population? I go with the former. Occam&#39;s Razor should really come into play more often here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t imply that people without an MS in a STEM field or any field might be crazies. Material needs to be sourced, that&#39;s how it works. You can&#39;t source something, then use that source to make an assumption that the source material never states, then broadly apply that assumption as fact.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t twist my words by implying I&#39;m some sort of elitist, that isn&#39;t what I was doing at all.</p>

<p>Edit: In case this sounded dismissive, let me rephrase: If it seemed like I was implying that, I wasn&#39;t. I also do not think people who have different opinions than me are crazy. I have an open mind. But I am pretty strict in what I will accept as evidence, and that puts my on the opposing view of a lot of people I see on this sub (not that I hold anything against anyone for believing whatever they want).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hubris. They didn&#39;t believe it could happen to them. and they didn&#39;t believe the nano particles of aluminum, called alumina, would come down. </p>

<p>The point is to change the reflectivity, or albedo of the earth by reflecting sunlight. Maybe there&#39;s some other expolanation for this kind of flight pattern.</p>

<p><a href="https://nevadastatepersonnelwatch.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/chemtrails-madness.jpg">https://nevadastatepersonnelwatch.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/chemtrails-madness.jpg</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ve seen your reflection in a piece of aluminum before haven&#39;t you? Didn&#39;t think so. It doesn&#39;t reflect well at all. It just heats up in the sun and traps heat below.</p>

<p>Any kind of cloud cover traps heat. Cloudy nights are warmer than clear ones for instance. Want to cool the earth, clear the sky.</p>

<p>So it was a stupid idea called geo-engineering, that will affect millions of us and most likely will never be admitted to. There has been a rapid, even unprecedented rise in mental disorders such as ADHD Bipolarism, Alzheimers and so on which can be tied to the rise in ambient aluminum. </p>
