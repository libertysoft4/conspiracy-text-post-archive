    <div class="md"><p>That is what you don&#39;t see. That is exactly apart of the system. If the system has been corrupted than the system itself needs to be redone. If the system has allowed this &#39;bastardized monster version&#39; to exist then that &#39;bastardized monster version&#39; is in and of itself apart of the system.</p>

<p>When building the new system we need to focus on incentives. What is our current system incentivizing and why is that not working for the greater population? Are individual incentives currently directly in competition with society&#39;s long term goals? We need to realize that since the advent of civilization, we still go back to our wild roots. The laws of the jungle never change. The weak get eaten weather you are in the Mediterranean tropic, the African Savana or a Manhattan board room.</p>

<p>If we want to evolve past this we have to make sure certain behaviors are reinforced and that reinforcement has to be equal or greater to the reinforcement of selfish incentives. For instance, if you want people to not do drugs you don&#39;t punish them for doing drugs you just make the drugs not give any reinforcement.  Want people to stop selling drugs? Make it unprofitable to do so. </p>

<p>If you look at our society through the lens of operant conditioning I think you will realize what needs to be done. You will also see how we are currently being conditioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.  I think the original constitution in it&#39;s creation was a masterpiece.  You had a group of people who had thought their whole life on escaping any form of rule, and crafted something to do that.  We&#39;re not running that system, and what we&#39;re running didn&#39;t get created out of this system, it got created through manipulation and opportunity seizures.  </p>

<p>The executive position we know now is nothing like the constitution.  A place that can both create secret policies <em>and</em> enact them without any congressional approval.  There is nothing like that in the constitution and specifically we were warned about the requirement of separation of powers.  We were warned that if at any point we break we break the Bill of Rights, that it would no longer be an effective government.  Remember, it also implied that the government only had powers that were specifically outlined by the constitution, not powers to do whatever except for those outlined.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t talk about drugs in the constitution because the framers clearly saw no need for the government to effect what any man did.  If there was a failure to this government, it was never on the part of the framing of the constitution, it&#39;s been in our lack of enforcing it or adhering to it.  </p>

<p>Every time a significant new law came into existence that could supplant what the Constitution established, was when this system became something else.  If it&#39;s not in a constitution, than it really shouldn&#39;t exist in any form on a federal level.  The judiciary was supposed to be the &quot;guardians&quot; of rights (according to Madison at the founding of the Bill of Rights), but now we don&#39;t even have a Supreme Court to rule on some of the most important decisions the executive branch is asking (it just takes them into the FISA court supplanting the Supreme Court, and supplanting Congress).  </p>

<p>This system didn&#39;t start broke, it&#39;s what we&#39;ve added to it that broke it.  </p>

<p>I mean just look at the CIA.  That&#39;s the executive branch.  But how did they get to enact policies (execute their own missions) as well as holding onto data gathered, as well as having a budget to do all of that and make decisions in the dark.  No sober man could examine that and say that it&#39;s a separation of powers, no sober man could look at the Constitution and come to the conclusion to create that monster.  Instead, it was formed out of WWII from the same framework from the OSS (Office of Strategic Services).  This system didn&#39;t start broken, but became broken out of fear and during crisis opportunity grabs.  </p>

<p>Just go look at the background of cases that Cromwell/Sullivan have been in on, that&#39;s a real piece of work at examining how to slowly break down a country&#39;s laws and interpret them favorably for a small few.  They taught the robber barons how to rob, and they&#39;ve been doing it for more than a century now.  </p>

<p>I think me and you agree, that a good leader doesn&#39;t have to lead.  But I think this system had that, we just were careless at points in history and added things that shouldn&#39;t be there.  </p>

<p>Some laws need to be pulled back.  Others need to be done away with and eradicated entirely.  Others need to be pushed forward, and still others need to be created anew entirely.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure that a system can be considered all that great if it allows for such tricks and chicanery.  It seems a system is needed that’s unafraid to strongly discipline anyone who undermines the core tenets agreed upon by everyone (whatever those tenets might ultimately be).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure nothing in that paper tells the citizen that they live in an oligarchy ruled by old money and bloodlines which connect most US presidents from the beginning. That their vote is meaningless because of manipulated votes, pre-selected presidents, social engineering and sophisticated media propaganda which doesn&#39;t allow the majority to build an informed opinion. All to delude the population that they have any input in how &quot;their&quot; country is ruled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a single part in that paper gives the government no power to do any of that.  It specifically outlines hat, we just don&#39;t fight for that.  The fact that people don&#39;t inform themselves and are too lazy to do it and fight for it (again, I&#39;m not saying you, because you are here and are clearly informed enough to see a lot of bullshit, it&#39;s just informing others and now that we see what the bullshit is, working hard to avoid the distractions and traps they setup for us, waking others up). </p>

<p>Maybe we&#39;re both talking about the same thing. But i honestly, 100% think the constitution is the greatest document on government (literally that was intended to be by he <em>people</em> for the <em>people</em>).  I don&#39;t know a better way, or what the law of the jungle would be.  They thought their whole life about that with some of the best minds of the time and experienced it.  I don&#39;t know what other system would be best, but I&#39;m open to hearing your thoughts (which probably sounds nerdy, but I love this shit and am a total history nerd).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the best time to stop digging a hole is X years ago. The second best time is now. I used to think that people would eventually wake up to their terrible political choices by witnessing the shitstorm it was creating unfortunately it seems to work like this:</p>

<p>1) Votes for lock-them-away for cannabis politician</p>

<p>2) Drugs problems increase, politician photographed snorting cocaine.</p>

<p>3) Votes for lock-them-away for cannabis politician</p>

<p>1) Votes for trickle-down politician</p>

<p>2) Economic situation deteriorates, politician gets cushy directorship at bank.</p>

<p>3) Votes for trickle-down politician</p>

<p>As for civil rights and populist movements, TPTB keeps tabs on anyone who could influence a lot of people, especially musicians and entertainers.  And since TPTB own the media, they could simply refuse the troublemakers any airtime.  But completely blacking out airtime for people would make people distrustful, so TPTB would hijack a movement, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">Operation COINTELPRO</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infiltration: Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit and disrupt. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.</p>

<p>Psychological warfare: The FBI and police used myriad &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists. They used bad-jacketing to create suspicion about targeted activists, sometimes with lethal consequences.[40]</p>

<p>Legal harassment: The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, &quot;investigative&quot; interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.[38][41]</p>

<p>Illegal force: The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.[38] The object was to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are being played. Trump is the ultimate salesman and he is a great at selling himself and his brand. He is a male version of Kim Kardashian. His name itself is a brand that sells a lifestyle. Seriously, think about this shit for a minute.</p>

<p>Trump is a businessman right? He made alot of money in real-estate correct? Do you think he would really clamp down on people that give/gave him money in order to operate his business? The banks are his business partners. Do you really think that a guy who says hes worth 10 billion dollars and whose name/brand is associated with luxury is really kicking the shit with average joes? You don&#39;t think that he plays golf with powerful people in the media,banking and political sector? You don&#39;t think he has lunch, dinner and vacations with these same individuals?</p>

<p>You are being played, Trump is here largely to distract you from other more important shit that&#39;s going on. He is being ridiculous causing a large amount of people to pay attention to him &#39;media whore&#39; it up. For Christ sake his whole campaign will probably be broken up into 30 minute segments and aired on cable television as a reality show after it is all said and done. Stop paying attention to Trump, look at whats going on in Syria. What&#39;s going on in Yemen. Whats going on as it pertains to individuals rights and freedoms, not just in America but around the World. Focus on whats happening to the oil markets and what is causing them to do what they do. Focus on whats happening as the US confronts China in the South China sea. Most importantly, focus on the TPP and what effects that&#39;s going to have. STOP FOCUSING ON TRUMP. &#39;TPTB&#39; want you to focus on this bullshit. This is why they are feeding it to you hand over fist everyday. Elections have been and always will be a horse and pony show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If &#39;anything&#39; gets regular national media attention then it&#39;s part of the system. It does not matter if they&#39;re insiders or outsiders. If you want to see how the system treats someone who they don&#39;t like then go back and read/watch the evidence of how Ron Paul was treated in the &#39;08 and &#39;12 campaigns.</p>

<p>If I or anyone 2 years ago had claimed that Donald Trump was going to be the Republican front runner after Super Tuesday they would have been laughed at by all. And yet here we are. It proves the power of the media to manipulate, influence, and control. What is alarming is watching the alt/truth media get sucked into it. Saying basically, &quot;Well Hillary is so bad, then I guess Trump is ok since we can&#39;t have Hillary&quot;. Choosing the lesser of two evils is still &#39;choosing&#39; evil. Do not choose evil. Obama is still in Office, and yet people have already forgotten his &#39;Hope &amp; Change&#39; BS.</p>

<p>I was first exposed to Trump in the mid 80&#39;s, so I&#39;ve been aware of his shenanigans for long time. dankdeeds is correct. Trump is no friend of the average person. His god is Money, just like all the other crooks in Washington DC. And it also means he is putty in the hands of those with real wealth and power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What I find interesting is how so many will lament the MSM as being bullshit lies and then in the same sentence just eat this Trump shit up like it&#39;s sugar infused crack-heroin.&quot;</p>

<p>This proves how effective the mind control is. And also that just because you&#39;re aware that the MSM (or TV for that matter) is lies and manipulation does not make one immune from it if you choose to expose yourself to it.</p>

<p>All are under layers and layers of mind control, programmed over decades. You do not &#39;wake up&#39; quickly or easily from this. It is a process. Never assume you&#39;re fully awake. The first step is awakening that you&#39;ve been programmed and manipulated. The next is to stop consuming said programming. The third is purging your mind of the programming you have exposed yourself too. None of these steps are easy, in fact I would say they are progressively more difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re mostly correct, I just am not sure if it&#39;s all correct and am not sure if I ever can.  Trump absolutely could be a ploy, I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m just saying that the medicine he&#39;s saying is the right cure whether he means to follow through on it or not.  He <em>could</em> be dangerous, but he&#39;s also been a team player through a lot, I&#39;d love to see any connections he has, but even without connections doesn&#39;t mean he wouldn&#39;t make a deal with higher players to make himself rich.  I&#39;m not seeing it, but I&#39;m definitely new to looking at him so I definitely don&#39;t know his connections or end game.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s hanging out with regular folk, but the difference between the rich and super rich gets crazy.  They&#39;re not rich now, they&#39;ve been rich through their families.  Those building their business up are a lot different than those protecting losses (or hoarding up power for power&#39;s sake).  I&#39;m probably nerding out right now, but I think you need a different world view to build something up vs one that&#39;s trying to protect losses.  I think one views the world as being abundant in resources (and works towards it, or views it as competition to win), and the other views it as running out of resources or never having enough.  Not all rich people are bad is where I&#39;m getting to, I think money and power aren&#39;t just for the worst people, but the worst people just tend to try to hoard them up.  Would love to know more of his background.  </p>

<p>I absolutely am paying attention to the rest of the world.  You&#39;re preaching to the choir.  TPP is planned as a way to bypass any governmental laws that don&#39;t favor the corporations or players that drafted it.  They don&#39;t need to invade a country with boots if they can supercede the law and get people to agree around it.  Individual rights are disappearing unless they are on the side of corporations as individuals.  I know Syria and Yemen and Afghanistan and... the list goes on.  I think they&#39;re important, but I honestly think TPP is the scariest part of it all.  The rest of the world right now is in a massive squeeze.  The oil price drop has cost more than 2 trillion dollars in assets - whose assets and why?  We saw something like this in the mid 80&#39;s in Texas.  What happens is that all these oil companies get contracts to produce on the land they&#39;re on, and if they stop producing because it&#39;s not making money, then they lose the contracts and close shop (and someone comes in to buy them at a reduced price).  It&#39;s happening with the fracking businesses now.  2 Trillion dollars already gone, and oil is always the bank&#39;s friend.  But whose losing that money?  Companies and nations are getting squeezed right now, consumers just have no idea because we are happy with our low oil prices.  Once it comes down enough the wolves move in for the slaughter and buy everything up or use it as leverage on those nations (TPP, TPIP, votes for NATO to move in on Syria or Russia...)  </p>

<p>Paying attention to Trump isn&#39;t my only focus.  Paying attention to Trump is because if he actually is real about this (which could make sense for creating more consumers with money, which we know vacations go up when people have more money, which is good for him).  The whole setup for fucking up the constitution and lowering individual freedoms has been in taking advantage of the executive part of that system.  If he came in and forced that part of the system to be more efficient, that&#39;s a huge blow.  If he stops the emergency state, that&#39;s a huge blow.  If he pulls back CIA, NSA, or FBI powers, that&#39;s a huge blow.  If he does anything at all to limit that single position, that&#39;s been the very position they&#39;ve worked so hard to subvert power from the other two parts of government (and the individuals).  Whoever is president is a key position.  Paying attention to it is important (but no, I&#39;m not paying attention solely or mostly to it, I think you&#39;d have to be a fool to believe anything completely by anyone talking about something while vying for that position).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump is the only one not onside with the plans of the globalist/NWO elite.  That is why it is critical for them to side-line him.  Some of what he proposes could prove disastrous, but at least he has America&#39;s interests at the forefront of his decision making.  The others are beholden to the NWO and will move in lockstep to implement their plans for global governance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the insanity in this system is strictly based on the executive branch getting out of control.  The ability to go to war without congressional vote is from a state of emergency that can be ended by a president.  The CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS, they all fall under the Executive branch.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re crazy if you think the President can&#39;t stop this.  It&#39;s all been built to power at one pinnacle position that the puppetmasters could control.  People are excited if they can get <em>just one</em> candidate in there who isn&#39;t controlled.  </p>

<p>Media can&#39;t reel him in.  Twitter&#39;s giving him his own publishing platform.  People want to listen to the craziness he says, and he&#39;s beating the puppets and their masters at their own tricks.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ignorant, especially looking at how hard they have tried to setup a system based on one key part of the Executive branch, which he could bring back the powers on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually there is plenty of things he proposes that rubs them the wrong way, and has them trying to get someone else. The border wall for example. They promised it to conservatives for years but never deliver. Cause it&#39;s not a part of the plan. Open borders, and the North American Union is the plan. They tricked people into accepting Amnesty in the 80&#39;s in exchange for more border security that never happened for example. Rubio was a part of an effort to get another Amnesty bill passed but it failed. No surprise they are pushing Rubio for nominee ever since Jeb dropped out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate all politicians. The US&#39;s power is on a downward trend. The president does&#39;t really matter. The election game has obvious winners that is the greater point of what I&#39;m saying here.</p>

<p>The only difference Trump will make is allowing Hillary to prance into the oval office. Trump only appears be successful in the political race be because he owns part of the media.</p>

<p>People vote moderate and vote incumbent party. Trump is extreme and opposing party. Powers that be like moderates because their price tag is lower. Trump makes all kinds of crazy remarks way to openly. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-republicans-ryan-idUSMTZSAPEC34IQ9V68">Republicans are even pushing trump out now.</a></p>

<p>Hillary has an endless list of people who owe her favors. She doesn&#39;t need money, but has plenty money anyway. She would also be the first female president, people like firsts. &quot;Clinton&quot; has had global name recognition for decades. She&#39;s married into the secret societies. Sanders has always been a non-contender. Hillary is probably stealing his votes, literally.</p>

<p>Despite all her political wrong doings she&#39;s going to be president because she plays dirty but keeps clean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this was before TPTB consolidated power and took over.  I think a lot of people would agree that JFK was the last president who wasn&#39;t a puppet.  </p>

<p>As for civil rights and populist movements, TPTB keeps tabs on anyone who could influence a lot of people, especially musicians and entertainers.  And since TPTB own the media, they could simply refuse the troublemakers any airtime.  But completely blacking out airtime for people would make people distrustful, so TPTB would hijack a movement, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">Operation COINTELPRO</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infiltration: Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit and disrupt. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.</p>

<p>Psychological warfare: The FBI and police used myriad &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists. They used bad-jacketing to create suspicion about targeted activists, sometimes with lethal consequences.[40]</p>

<p>Legal harassment: The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, &quot;investigative&quot; interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.[38][41]</p>

<p>Illegal force: The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.[38] The object was to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are being played. Trump is the ultimate salesman and he is a great at selling himself and his brand. He is a male version of Kim Kardashian. His name itself is a brand that sells a lifestyle. Seriously, think about this shit for a minute.</p>

<p>Trump is a businessman right? He made alot of money in real-estate correct? Do you think he would really clamp down on people that give/gave him money in order to operate his business? The banks are his business partners. Do you really think that a guy who says hes worth 10 billion dollars and whose name/brand is associated with luxury is really kicking the shit with average joes? You don&#39;t think that he plays golf with powerful people in the media,banking and political sector? You don&#39;t think he has lunch, dinner and vacations with these same individuals?</p>

<p>You are being played, Trump is here largely to distract you from other more important shit that&#39;s going on. He is being ridiculous causing a large amount of people to pay attention to him &#39;media whore&#39; it up. For Christ sake his whole campaign will probably be broken up into 30 minute segments and aired on cable television as a reality show after it is all said and done. Stop paying attention to Trump, look at whats going on in Syria. What&#39;s going on in Yemen. Whats going on as it pertains to individuals rights and freedoms, not just in America but around the World. Focus on whats happening to the oil markets and what is causing them to do what they do. Focus on whats happening as the US confronts China in the South China sea. Most importantly, focus on the TPP and what effects that&#39;s going to have. STOP FOCUSING ON TRUMP. &#39;TPTB&#39; want you to focus on this bullshit. This is why they are feeding it to you hand over fist everyday. Elections have been and always will be a horse and pony show.</p>
