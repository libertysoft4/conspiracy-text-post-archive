        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One major example is the &quot;melted&quot; steel conspiracy. Yes, Jet fuel burns at 800° to 1500°F, not hot enough to melt steel (2750°F). However, Steel loses about 50 percent of its strength at 1100°F. NIST reports that pockets of fire hit 1832°F.  Also, the jet fuel burned for about 10 minutes, and the towers still were standing after ten minutes. Jet fuel was the ignition, but the inferno was intensified by other combustible materials.  It was the rest of the stuff burning afterward that was responsible for the heat transfer that eventually brought them down.</p>

<p>Why are things like; Combustible Materials or the fact that steel loses about 50 percent of its strength at 1100°F denied? Either people don&#39;t think of this, or they deny it because of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>There is an Anti-intellectualism movement on the rise. Its very harmful to our society. We have Holocaust deniers, Anti-vaxxers, 9/11 truthers, YEC, Flat-Earthers, Anti-GMO advocates, ect, ect.</p>

<p>I am all for questioning everything, but there is a point; Be open minded, but no so open minded that your brain falls out of your skull</p>

<p>OPs previous writings.</p>

<p>The thing is that believing in the official 9/11 story is being anti-intellectual. See, you think that 9/11 truthers are just dumb people that have fallen for one of many hoaxes out there. I know because I was the same way when I was just starting to figure things out. </p>

<p>The problem of course is that the official 9/11 story requires denial of science and logic. The incredibly close timing of the attacks. The unbelievable skilled flying of supposedly amateur pilots. The 4+ scheduled military drills interfering with the response to the hijacks. The explosion at the pentagon and lack of footage. The so-called crash site in Pennsylvania. The now painfully obvious controlled implosion of WTC7 as well as the main towers. </p>

<p>Cognitive dissonance is taking all this evidence and shoving it to the back of your mind because you so desperately want us to be the good guys, I know because I&#39;ve been there. However as you get older and wiser and realize how much of the world is bullshit, the time will come to re-think 9/11 and find that the main beneficiaries were the most likely to have orchestrated it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a 9/11 truther, but then I got an education and realized its all just conspiracy bullshit. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists claim to be skeptical, but their theories are usually based on far-fetched claims that are nearly impossible to disprove, or prove. They are void of skepticism and logic. </p>

<p>&quot;My skepticism is further strengthened by the fact that we humans have an assortment of cognitive biases that can distort our judgments and allow us to maintain beliefs despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Some of these biases include the tendency to see patterns where none exist, and to interpret new information and recall old information in ways that confirm our expectations and beliefs. However, most of the time we&#39;re unaware of these biases and overly confident that our perceptions represent the objective truth.</p>

<p>This is not to say that conspiracies never happen, or that I&#39;m immune from engaging in my own conspiracy-like thinking sometimes. It just means that one of my own biases is to doubt these sorts of theories.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For one thing, conspiracy theories help us cope with distressing events and make sense out of them. Conspiracies assure us that bad things don&#39;t just happen randomly. Conspiracies tell us that someone out there is accountable, however unwittingly or secretly or incomprehensibly, so it&#39;s possible to stop these people and punish them and in due course let everyone else re-establish control over their own lives. Conspiracies also remind us that we shouldn&#39;t blame ourselves for our predicaments; it&#39;s not our fault, it&#39;s them! In these ways, believing in conspiracies serves many of the same self-protective functions as scapegoating.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It must not have been a physics education, then. As for the human psyche, biases exist everywhere but writing off all conspiracy theories is just as stupid. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxiQmtVGgcQ">Here</a> are psychologists explaining the opposite argument, why 9/11 truth is hard to accept for many intelligent people just because it would be disruptive to their worldview.</p>

<p>To answer your initial point, the fact that steel loses its strength under heat is taken into account by the structural engineers that built the towers. Often things are built 3, 4 times as strong as necessary and the heavy steel cores in the center of the building offered very good redundancy. The towers could easily withstand a plane strike or two and burn for hours without collapsing.</p>

<p>However there were explosives required to bring the buildings down in the manner that they did. This is an inescapable fact that regardless of your own acceptance or not, will become a commonplace truth one day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The common thread between distrust and cynicism, as defined in these experiments, is a perception of bad character. More broadly, it’s a tendency to focus on intention and agency, rather than randomness or causal complexity. In extreme form, it can become paranoia. In mild form, it’s a common weakness known as the fundamental attribution error—ascribing others’ behavior to personality traits and objectives, forgetting the importance of situational factors and chance. Suspicion, imagination, and fantasy are closely related.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the 2003 survey in which Gallup asked 471 Americans about JFK’s death. Thirty-seven percent said the Mafia was involved, 34 percent said the CIA was involved, 18 percent blamed Vice President Johnson, 15 percent blamed the Soviets, and 15 percent blamed the Cubans. If you’re doing the math, you’ve figured out by now that many respondents named more than one culprit. In fact, 21 percent blamed two conspiring groups or individuals, and 12 percent blamed three. The CIA, the Mafia, the Cubans—somehow, they were all in on the plot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response is exactly what you&#39;d expect from a conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>&quot;People who fall for such theories don’t trust the government or the media. They aim their scrutiny at the official narrative, not at the alternative explanations. In this respect, they’re not so different from the rest of us. Psychologists and political scientists have repeatedly demonstrated that “when processing pro and con information on an issue, people actively denigrate the information with which they disagree while accepting compatible information almost at face value.” Scholars call this pervasive tendency “motivated skepticism.”</p>

<p>Conspiracy believers are the ultimate motivated skeptics. Their curse is that they apply this selective scrutiny not to the left or right, but to the mainstream. They tell themselves that they’re the ones who see the lies, and the rest of us are sheep. But believing that everybody’s lying is just another kind of gullibility.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t bother pulling the &quot;it burned for seven hours&quot; card, because an engineer from the office of emergency management (whose name is lost to history) came on the scene only 2 hours after the North Tower collapsed - about 1 PM - and told the fire chiefs that WTC 7 was a lost cause and it was going to collapse at 5 or 6 PM (it came down at 5:21 PM). Don&#39;t forget, also, how Giuliani casually mentioned on the news that he was told the South Tower was going to collapse despite all of the firefighters thinking collapse was impossible, often because the information was spread around that the Towers were known to able to withstand a 707 plane crash (Rudy later changed his story). No plane hit seven, yet reading through the oral histories of the firefighters, they all seemed 100% sure WTC 7 was going collapse some time that day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Jet fuel and steel beams&quot; is a smokescreen to keep people from looking at what we can all clearly see, if we just take a moment to look.</p>

<p>The twin towers exploded from top to bottom, and turned to dust as they fell.</p>

<p>1360+ feet tall, and they both fell in about ten seconds. That’s 93 mph. Complete destruction of both towers and everything and everyone in them, from top to bottom, at 93 mph. (That&#39;s the average speed over ten seconds...not &quot;starting at zero mph then speeding up to 93 mph&quot;.)</p>

<p>There are no pics of “110 collapsed floors”. There should be lots of pictures and videos showing two piles. There are none. Because they didn’t collapse…they exploded, then turned to dust in mid-air.</p>

<p>You can see long trails extending upward off of all the pieces as they fall.</p>

<p>That’s not smoke. That’s not ash. That’s the building and all its contents, pulverized.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3fWFImU5lcY">https://youtu.be/3fWFImU5lcY</a> </p>

<p>There were no piles of 110 pancaked floors afterwards. (Should’ve been two piles.)</p>

<p>The next morning on ABC Peter Jennings asked George Stephanopoulos what happened to all the debris. He claimed he was told by a volunteer (“Robert Gurlinsky”) the buildings “simply fell down into the ground and were pulverized-evaporated.”</p>

<p>Two 110 story buildings—<em>“pulverized-evaporated”</em>—<em>“simply”</em>.</p>

<p>Everything—the buildings and all their contents—<em>“vaporized”</em>.</p>

<p><em>Vaporize – to convert into a gaseous state.</em></p>

<p>I don’t know how the buildings were turned to dust. But We The People are being lied to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop <a href="https://youtu.be/dueVm1UGvXo">this video</a> at any time and you see long trails of dust extending upward from the pieces of the falling building.  The buildings exploded and turned to dust in mid-air as they fell.  In the real world---the world we live in---that cannot possibly be caused by jet fuel, no matter how many times people repeat that silly lie.</p>

<p>Why are there some who completely deny what we can all see with our own two eyes?  I will excuse your response if you are blind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jet fuel burned for about 10 minutes, and the towers still were standing after ten minutes. Jet fuel was the ignition, but the inferno was intensified by other combustible materials. It was the rest of the stuff burning afterward that was responsible for the heat transfer that eventually brought them down.</p>

<p>Jet fuel, other then starting the fire, had nothing to do with it. it was the chain of events that happened after, that cause the towers to fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video clearly shows that the buildings exploded outward from top to bottom, then turned to dust in mid-air.</p>

<p>Anyone that says otherwise, disputing what can clearly be seen by anyone and everyone who views the video, is either blind, an idiot, or a liar.  You know how to use the internet and post comments on Reddit, therefore we can assume you are not an idiot.  If you are blind, you should have someone with eyesight explain to you what others can see in the video.  If you are a liar, you should know that you are aiding and abetting a crime against humanity, and may you receive what you deserve.</p>

<p>One major example is the &quot;melted&quot; steel conspiracy. </p>

<p>That is just stupid. Molten steel isn&#39;t a &quot;conspiracy.&quot; There were pools of molten metal at ground zero for months afterward - this was even reported by the New York Times.</p>

<p>So, that isn&#39;t a &quot;conspiracy&quot; - it&#39;s an observed and acknowledged fact.</p>

<p>So, you should probably delete this thread and try again, so as to maintain some semblance of credibility.</p>
