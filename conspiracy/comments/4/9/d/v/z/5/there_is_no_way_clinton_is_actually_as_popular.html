<p>FTFY</p>

<p>Every election is a psyop to continue the illusion that we actually have a decision in the matter. If voting actually worked/matters, they wouldn&#39;t allow us to do it.</p>

<p>There is definitely an awakening. It&#39;s just the media needs to make it seem like anyone who questions their version of reality must be a Trump supporter, racist, hyper-evangelical, anti-Semitic Zionist, conspiracy theorist, and/or Flat Earther.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a lot more than that. They are nervous, which is why their actions are more and more outrageous and easy to see through for more and more people.</p>

Even if were not all on the same exact page in this sub its still amazing if even a percent of that 300,000 are tuning into and understanding the intelligent discussions a few of us are have here daily.

    <div class="md"><p>And it doesn&#39;t much matter what they try to cover up and have success with, consciousness is a whack-a-mole for them.</p>

<p>We should focus on the low-hanging fruit from the poisoned tree to pluck. NASA and false flag shootings can come later, once we&#39;ve started to peel the onion.</p>

<p>All of us woke up bit by bit, not all at once. It&#39;s been a tapestry of lies, once you start to pull the thread, it can all come undone. 9/11 is the sloppiest big production of all, and people are just about ready to hear it. When that blows open, the whole construct could fall apart.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t lament NASA shit not making it to the front page. Blow out the stuff that does that we know to be true, and share with others. </p>

<p>My concern is the big chemtrail denial will last long enough for them to poison us via the atmosphere as they all head underground. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>since we introduced crack into your communities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s so true annd his &quot;war on crime&quot; bill 20 years ago has come back to haunt his wife&#39;s run for POTUS.</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty years ago this week, in 1994, then-President Bill Clinton signed a crime bill. It was, in effect, a long-term experiment in various ways to fight crime.</p>

<p>The measure paid to put more cops on the beat, trained police and lawyers to investigate domestic violence, imposed tougher prison sentences and provided money for extra prisons.</p>

<p>Clinton described his motivation to pass the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act in stark terms.</p>

<p>&quot;Gangs and drugs have taken over our streets and undermined our schools,&quot; he said. &quot;Every day, we read about somebody else who has literally gotten away with murder.&quot;</p>

<p>. . . Nick Turner of Vera ( Vera Institute, a nonprofit that researches crime policy) put the human costs even more starkly.</p>

<p>&quot;If you&#39;re a black baby born today, you have a 1 in 3 chance of spending some time in prison or jail,&quot; Turner said. &quot;If you&#39;re Latino, it&#39;s a 1 in 6 chance. And if you&#39;re white, it&#39;s 1 in 17. And so coming to terms with these disparities and reversing them, I would argue, is not only a matter of fairness and justice but it&#39;s, I would argue, a matter of national security.&quot;</p>

<p>Talk to combatants in the long and sometimes nasty debate over the crime bill 20 years ago, and another item on the table back then looks different with hindsight too. It&#39;s a concept known as midnight basketball.</p>

<p>Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, voted against the bill years ago, in part because it didn&#39;t do enough to support prevention programs.</p>

<p>In between votes in the Capitol this week, Scott reflected on the debate.</p>

<p>&quot;Midnight basketball was described as paying money so that crackheads could play basketball in the middle of the night,&quot; Scott said. &quot;What they left out was the fact that every time they put midnight basketball in a neighborhood, the crime rate plummeted. You saved more money than you spent on the midnight basketball. They left that part out.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1/17 isn&#39;t that low either, and with all the crap they tell us about how great whites have it (so stop complaining goy), who knows if its even true?</p>

<p>Even if these numbers are true - they&#39;ll bring what the they did to the blacks and latinos to the poor in middle class whites, in facts its already happening. </p>

<p>They introduced crack into the ghetto in the last wave, now its heroin in suburbia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree 100%, see <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> where those trolls are going nuts over Sanders statment yesterday.  They want a race war so bad!  It ain&#39;t gonna happen!!! Look how much Soros spent trying to get it going in Ferguson and now it nothing.  Yes our county has problems but we all  want to work it out, not fight.  The media are nasty scoundrels and as much as i hate some of the things Donald Trump says its very telling to see how the established media is going to full on war with him.  </p>

<p>Because Democrats don&#39;t live to old age? Old Democrats don&#39;t vote, but old Republicans do? People suddenly see the error of their ways and switch parties on their 50th birthdays?</p>

<p>Clinton and Sanders are both senior citizens past retirement age. What makes you think seniors have no impact on results?</p>
