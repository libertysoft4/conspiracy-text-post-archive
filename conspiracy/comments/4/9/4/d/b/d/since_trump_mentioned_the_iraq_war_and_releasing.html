        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On February 18th, Donald Trump said:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We went after Iraq, they did not knock down the World Trade Center. It wasn’t the Iraqis that knocked down the World Trade Center, we went after Iraq, we decimated the country, Iran’s taking over, okay.</p></li>
<li><p>But it wasn’t the Iraqis, you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center. Because they have papers in there that are very secret, you may find it’s the Saudis, okay? But you will find out.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Donald Trump has the Cabal squirming!!!</p>

<p>Since he brought up the Iraq War and the 28 pages former high ranking officials have been lining up to take their shots at Trump in the media:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/jeb-and-george-w-bush-spar-with-donald-trump-in-south-carolina/">George W. Bush</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/02/15/dick-cheney-donald-trump-blaming-george-w-bush-911-way-base">Dick Cheney</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-hayden-donald-trump_us_56d1ed18e4b0871f60eba2f3">former CIA-NSA chief Michael Hayden</a> </p></li>
<li><p>and other <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/16/pentagon-troops-it-s-us-or-trump.html">Pentagon officers</a>:  &quot;We Quit if Trump Wins&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/">112 GOP national security leaders</a>: including Philip Zelikow, Dov Zakheim, Michael Mukasey, Michael Chertoff  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>WHY???</p>

<p>Because the American public knows the Iraq War was sold to us on a pile of LIES...and there is no defense of NOT releasing the 28 Pages...</p>

<p>Former Senator Bob Graham had this to say last year at a press conference when he called for the release of the 28 Pages: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Saudis know what they did. They are not persons who are unaware of the consequences of their government’s actions. Second, the Saudis know that we know what they did! Somebody in the Federal government has read these 28 pages, someone in the Federal government has read all the other documents that have been covered up so far. And the Saudis know that...</p></li>
<li><p>...They have continued, maybe accelerated their support for one of the most extreme forms of Islam, Wahhabism, throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East. And second, they have supported their religious fervor, with financial and other forms of support, of the institutions which were going to carry out those extreme forms of Islam. Those institutions have included mosques, madrassas, and military. Al-Qaeda was a creature of Saudi Arabia; the regional groups such as al-Shabaab have been largely creatures of Saudi Arabia; and now, ISIS is the latest creature!</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://28pages.org/2015/01/10/jan-7-h-res-14-press-conference-full-video-and-transcript/">http://28pages.org/2015/01/10/jan-7-h-res-14-press-conference-full-video-and-transcript/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>In addition, 9/11 victims&#39; family members have called for the release of the 28 Pages...Even the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commission (Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton) have called for the release of the 28 pages in the summer of 2014:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vidinfo.org/video/5054082/thomas-kean-lee-hamilton-call-for-the-release">http://www.vidinfo.org/video/5054082/thomas-kean-lee-hamilton-call-for-the-release</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>So, expect more turbulence for Trump if he keeps on mentioning the Iraq War (which brings attention to their War Crimes) and the 28 Pages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah, but also because after South Carolina it became increasingly clear that Trump was bulldozing his way to actually winning the nomination. </p>

<p>The 28 pages may well be a part of that, but it&#39;s not the only reason the pushback is reaching freakout level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks OP for doing all the leg work gathering up this material. I can&#39;t imagine they won&#39;t try to kill Donald Trump. They can&#39;t afford Trump once he&#39;s successfully elected. He&#39;s got to select a VP who&#39;s absolutely abhorrent to the NWO to succeed him. Assassination proofing could involve bringing in Rand Paul, or perhaps War Machine if he&#39;s out of jail in November? </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t pick a Boosh to make peace with the RINOs. They almost killed Ronald Reagan only 8 months into his first term of office. Imagine Attorney General Roger Stone investigating JFK, RFK, MLK, RR and the NWO gang!!!!</p>

Having a VP pick would make your ticket sound bad ass. The GOP Ticket of Trump War Machine will be visiting the State Fair followed by a cage match with Harry Ried a once promising boxer. Proceeds from the match will all go to the Clinton Foundation where I doubt they&#39;ll spend a dime on smelly poor people/sarc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the other thing at play is how increasingly clear that TPTB intend(ed) to put Hillary in the White House, and that has been more of a problem than anticipated. Too many people know her history now (largely thanks to many on this sub and our ilk), and there&#39;s substantial evidence that the FBI and isolated members of the intelligence community and military are also aware of her history and agenda – and they don&#39;t like it. Bernie and Trump have become too popular on top of it, so they need to do a lot of vote rigging in Bernie&#39;s case and bring out the smear campaigns for Trump. I mean really, Mitt Romney suddenly gets airtime to bash this guy? And there are people who still give a shit about his opinion? What a fucking circus.</p>

<p>The fact that there&#39;s an effort to smear/defame a guy like Donald Trump because he&#39;s actually a threat to become the POTUS is just incredible. Can&#39;t laugh or cry, just amazed. I think the numbers of people still suckered by this theater are shrinking, but there are still plenty to keep the sham on course.</p>

It was pretty obvious that it was a veiled threat.  There&#39;s no doubt that the intensity of the opposition has ramped up significantly after he said this. </p>
