        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Odom is the guy who shot a pastor the day after the pastor invoked prayer at a Ted Cruz rally. After shooting the pastor, he got in his car, drove away - and, despite law enforcement knowing exactly who he was, he boarded a plane, flew to DC, and the only reason he was apprehended was because he was caught throwing documents and a thumb drive over the White House fence.</p>

<p>He is described in the news as suffering from &quot;unspecified mental illness;&quot; no mention is made of the medications he may have been taking or not taking. He does refer to deep meditation in the manifesto.</p>

<p>Thought this&#39;d be a good place for discussion. It&#39;s published <a href="http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/khq/ODOMDOCS.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story is interesting but also terrifying.  I had a strikingly similar experience in my life sans the Martian conspiracy part. I saw a blue light after a lot of prayer and also woke up with tears. I didn&#39;t go crazy then but a few years later I went completely off. I also was super stressed in school and completely stopped sleeping. Every few hours I had a different theory as to what my reality was.  This went on for months.  I took no drugs or other substances. </p>

<p>The story he tells is different than mine but a lot of similar things. I also thought people were digiusing themselves as other people. He thought it was Martians I had my own story (it&#39;s pretty in depth and kind of comical now but i don&#39;t want to dox myself.) Luckily my outbursts were harmless and not stopping a Martian dominated world. I&#39;m so happy I never killed anyone. </p>

<p>I read his story today and was taken aback. That could have been me. Thankfully I had a great support system of family and friends and doctors that helped me. I&#39;m a normal functioning adult now and have been for some time. </p>

<p>I hope he gets the help he needs. In my experience its not just meds and loving support that fixed me(although they were essental).  Because I got to where I was from (what at the time) I thought was a logical conclusion, my world did not completely right itself until I logically saw the flaws in my thinking. This dude is no dummy. He has to be brought to reality under his own understanding or he won&#39;t be convinced it is the case. He needs a space where he can&#39;t harm others or himself and can talk about what is going on. Someone listening helps a ton and maybe he could see for himself the holes in his story. Right now the story he is telling IS his reality.<br/>
It&#39;s sad to see this happen but hopefully this story turns around like mine did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm.  Pastor Tim is talking and in good spirits. He and his family sent prayers for Kyle - they understand he&#39;s ill. But on a really weird side note: the guy was shot 6 times, including a bullet to the head. His skull literally stopped the bullet. Call it a miracle if you subscribe to that kind of thinking- or- Aliens. Either way, odom didn&#39;t kill anyone and the victim is recovering. </p>

<p>and here was my personal convo about the event:</p>

<p>Roommate: He got shot six times? 
Me: So reported...
Roommate: In the head and the bullet didn&#39;t penetrate?
Me: Not according to the Church People.
Roommate: Was it a twenty-two?
Me: HellifIknow! </p>

<p>Twenty two, at distance and angle might not penetrate skull! </p>

<p>My roommate looked at the Newtown shit show and Hebdo/Paris with much insight. </p>

<p>Really bizarre shit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sheesh.  Really does sound like it.  I just read the whole manifesto last night.  It really sucks too because off world intelligent, technologically advanced beings are <em>100% real</em>.  Zero doubt about it.  They exist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">all throughout the cosmos</a>, and live in this very galaxy, solar system, and <em>on this very planet</em>.  They <em>exist.</em></p>

<p>That being said...the more I read through Odom&#39;s manifesto, the more it seems like what happened with him was that he was a &quot;normal&quot; kid that perhaps had some deep but ultimately latent/dormant psychopathic/psychotic tendencies which would have likely <em>remained</em> dormant...but that were somehow activated by what he experienced during his meditative practices.  The things he saw and experienced during his meditation may have in fact actually occurred and been real.  However, it seems like it somehow activated something in his brain that just made him start thinking that <em>everybody around him</em> was part of &quot;them&quot;...and it seems it may have made him go a little wonky in the mind as a result.</p>

<p>It sounds like maybe 10-15% of what he experienced and saw (in and out of meditation) <em>was</em> indeed real (which is a big deal because he talks about some <em>far out shit</em> in his manifesto)…but a good 50-80% might not have been.</p>

<p>All this is to say that I don&#39;t doubt for a moment that at least <em>some</em> of what he said he saw and experienced was, again, very much real and true.  We do indeed live in a very fucked up, very controlled, very strange, and manipulated world.  However...I&#39;m not sure I can say that <em>everything</em> he experienced and everyone he saw that he thought was one of &quot;them&quot; actually <em>was</em> one of &quot;them&quot; and it wasn&#39;t, instead, his mind just going wonky and playing serious tricks on him.</p>

<p>What&#39;s fucked up about all this is that what this story does/is going to do is that it will take all those other individuals who do also have very real experiences…and it will put them in a bad light, and it will cause unthinking, uncritical type of people (which unfortunately seems to be many people in society) to immediately take <em>real</em> ET claims - and even the overall practice of <em>meditation itself</em> - and associate it all with <em>this</em> kid.  They&#39;ll immediately categorize people making ET claims or who even just talk about entering and achieving deep meditative states as being “Just another wonky weirdo like that other kid.  Hey!  Make sure you don&#39;t go on any shooting sprees, you tin foil hat weirdo!  Durrr!!&quot;</p>

<p>fucking smh…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m about 20 miles from the church where this happened. There are some small details I&#39;ve picked up from being a local- the media here is all over this case. </p>

<p>Initially the message he got inviting him to the church was a wrong number. The church is known for having a very solid addict recovery program. Meth is HUGE here. There is a serious epidemic especially on NIC campus in Idaho. There is a theory floating that he was a solid good guy- so something happened. </p>

<p>The tweakers around here seem <em>obsessed</em> with this lizard people theory. The few I know carry binoculars and are constantly taking apart trac phones and pulling chips out. Seriously. This is a thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;m down in the Valley myself. Was aware of this program from former clients wishing to relocate. </p>

<p>From the sounds of it he put himself into the VA for Mental Health care and this is something that would be very rare, in my experience for <em>an addict</em>. </p>

<p>Did you, by chance, attend the Christopher Bolyn event?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t catch Bolyn when he was here. I keep an open mind but he&#39;s a little too &quot;fringe&quot; for me. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right about the rarity of addicts going in for mental health, but my dad was a vet (and an addict) who did check into the VA for help. So- I probably have a little confirmation bias. To me Odom sounds like a really stressed out guy who went days with out any sleep. That can make a sane person crack imo. I&#39;m theorizing though- that he got pulled into drugs to ease his pain. Mental health issues, plus insomnia is a recipe for disaster. </p>

<p>The only thing I can point to is the suicidal comments in the manifesto. Suicidal ideation can be a precursor for drug use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find anything on layovers during his flight, but there are a lot of reporters talking about <em>how</em> he got past TSA. News snip: &quot;...the vetting system does not query criminal databases like the FBI’s National Crime Information Center. That means people with active arrest warrants can fly relatively freely in the country because they are not routinely flagged by the terrorist-watch list.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they tracked him until they had a report that he may have entered Oregon. That&#39;s where it seems they lost him. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Police tracked Odom’s vehicle using license plate recognition cameras on Interstate 90, White said.
“It was instrumental in letting us know his movements immediately after the shooting. … Really the only definitive information we got was from those cameras,” he said.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just finished reading.  Giving the benefit of the doubt to its authenticity based on what has happened to others that I <em>know</em> is true.  The answer to his problems became apparent about three pages in, but given the known outcome of his fate, I knew it wouldn&#39;t appear within the narrative.</p>

<p>All I can say is that, if you choose to dabble in deep meditation and consciousness expansion, know that you are venturing into the <strong>spiritual</strong> realm.  </p>

<p>Why do I say this?</p>

<p>Because if you dip your toes into this realm, to the extent of making yourself known to those which exist primarily outside of our dimension, [this takes substantial effort and patience, combined with a superabundance of fortitude (do you notice what isn&#39;t required out of that which is mentioned here?)] don&#39;t kid yourself with thinking there isn&#39;t a consequence if you reach certain states [such as mentioned in the story].</p>

<p>The repercussions of doing this without having a central point and belief in <em>something positive</em> such as God, Christ Consciousness, Jesus, etc.  By central point I mean something that which you are willing to die for willingly and openly out of love and <em>altruistic belief</em>, you open yourself to <strong>all entities</strong> positive or negative.</p>

<p>I believe that since God was not mentioned a single time within the story, he opened himself to the extreme negative entities of Orion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also experienced this blue light</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, because that&#39;s literally what I called it. &quot;The blue light&quot;</p>

<p>It was preceded by me forgoing drug use and seeking other states of consciousness through meditation as well. While I was experiencing this I felt this positive glow around me and my empathy was through the roof. I could dissect and see the flaws in everything, without being aggressive or defensive. See through every lie. The world and all of the concepts contained therein seemed like they were made of plastic, and still do somewhat but to a much lesser degree. Also had tons of lucid dreams and OBEs for awhile where I saw what I consider to be &quot;real reality&quot;, so many other worlds.</p>

<p>I was convinced I was a hair&#39;s breadth away from leaving this world. It would come and go in waves that would get stronger each time.</p>

<p>It was interrupted by a lot of things... I went back to baseline quickly. I&#39;ve also been in &quot;telepathic&quot; (sounds ridiculous, I know) contact with seemingly capricious &quot;beings&quot;, whose motives I can&#39;t ascertain, but they seem to be distracting me or trying to steer me in a different direction.</p>

<p>Anyway I didn&#39;t read the whole thing, not sure why he went the violence route. One thing I learned in that state was to, despite the increased awareness of everything that is wrong and the incredible precariousness of existence (if you can even call it that) here, hate the game, not the players who are coerced by reality into being who they are (and therefore entirely faultless, no matter what they do). And don&#39;t even hate the game, just walk away from it because if you hate it then you&#39;re just engaging in it further.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna dismiss his experiences, how much of it was real and how much of it was delusion is up in the air imo. It&#39;s probably a mix of the two. People are going to dismiss him off the bat because of &quot;trigger words&quot; like &quot;mental illness&quot;, &quot;aliens&quot;, etc. that provoke an automated response of sorts no matter what in the end.</p>

<p>I hope this world resolves itself soon.</p>

<p>Then he boards a flight out of Boise. This is a smaller airport but it still employs TSA screening! There are NO direct flights out of Boise so, he had to land in Denver/Atlanta/Chicago to continue to DC! Did he rent a car when he got to DC? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I hope to God this doesn&#39;t become an organized conspiracy/religion. Anyways, I share the same story, but not on details. After almost a full year of depression without help (my dad didn&#39;t care to listen, nor could I afford a psychiatrist), I didn&#39;t channel my sadness into meditation, but rather deep thought. After time, these thoughts grew and grew. My psychological skills became more and more advanced. Without struggle, I naturally would increase my skills at an alarming rate. I read body language so easy I could read someone.</p>

<p>Eventually, I learned to control my eyes (to water, or dry). Then, by body temperature, and then my heartrate. One day however, I had an insane experience during these deep thoughts that only expanded my mind, perhaps too far. See, the 10% we use of our brain controls our thoughts, but once you reach 11%, you can control your heartrate. I didn&#39;t realize at the time if I went past, I could potentially acquire control of my heart or other organs and perhaps stop them, obviously killing me in the process.</p>

<p>After this horrible existential-crisis-like deep thought I had, in best words: I felt like my mind was trying to break out of reality, everything I saw going back and forth rapidly in a fish-eye formation. For 2 seconds, I reached a state of carelessness for my reality. I realized I was only a microdecimal compared to the entire existence of the world and its existence forth-worth. I could kill, without caring. After these two seconds, I came back into reality. I couldn&#39;t believe what I had thought, what I could do.</p>

<p>Ever since (it&#39;s been about 2 years now) I have been dumbing myself down. I&#39;m a lot more social, I get out more, I play online instead of only single-player. I got rid of my existential books, I resorted myself from existential thought. I started listening to Christian metal and realized I&#39;m more to reality. We all are. We were all put here individually for a purpose by God, and I think that&#39;s the best right any of us could have.</p>

<p>My only problem now however, is when I talk to people my eyes water. It&#39;s a psychological fear that I could control if I focused on it (I coined the term through my whole existential bullshit: meditation of thought condensation, or MTC) I won&#39;t use MTC on it however, I don&#39;t want to go back into the whole mental state I was in.</p>

<p>This is the first time I&#39;ve ever shared my extremely long, extremely thought-provoking story. Before I go, I might add that there are bonuses. With my immense knowledge I received of body-language, I&#39;m not an A+ actor in my Drama class, extremely charismatic, and have heavy knowledge of how the human mind operates and when I hear about a psychological syndrome, no need to research why some would have it. I can already tell. Of course, I DO NOT recommend deep thought meditation or MTC to ANYONE. It simply will spiral you out of control into insanity, and many studies have shown that meditation/deep thought is a leading cause in insanity. Well anyways, God bless you all and may you all find divine peace :)</p>

<p>(got here from Google btw, ain&#39;t a conspiracy nut /:D)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it seems he had a couple of sleep paralysis experiences. he also probably fell asleep while meditating and experienced sleep paralysis. when people have sleep paralysis, they somewhat feel aware and out of body, also they can get aroused and some experience sexual encounters with jinn-like creatures.</p>

<p>he also seems schizophrenic which would explain a lot of his paranoia.</p>

<p>if he was going to church i&#39;m sure he would have felt like everyone there was crazy, definitely understand that, could have exacerbated his paranoia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out kyle odoms report that he wrote. It&#39;s worth a read. It shows how real experiences can be continously seen through the tint of confusion. Unable to see all that presents as it is by the habit of projecting our concepts over the reality. A classic case of meditation being mistaken for a means to become magical. If only they could see through the unlimited power of mind. It&#39;s sad how this is based around meditation. Unfortunately meditation is taught by many that don&#39;t understand proper technique and this confusion translates to the student. Far too often the professor tries to teach &quot;profound&quot; teachings that are really far from being profound. Meditation is not about becoming something else or achieving high states of whatever you wish to call it. It is simply a practise to get to know the mind and it&#39;s potential. This is done through a very simple yet not soo simple formal period where one brings their awareness to the present moment without judgement of thoughts feelings or sensations. That&#39;s it!! Since we do the opposite all day we can&#39;t learn about our habits and tendencies so this is a formal get to know you period without participating in the distraction. I apologize to anyone that I have offended if so, that would be the unthinkable act and does not reflect my intention which is, to simply clarify a little so that this unfortunate confusion is ceased. Let me note that anyone&#39;s experience here of meditation is 100% okay. The issue lies more in the judgement and fixation to our experience when  we bring the awareness. Anyone have questions feel free to ask me. I have been meditating for a while. Let us pray for all those people suffering from such pain.</p>
