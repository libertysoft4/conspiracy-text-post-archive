        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, just to clarify; none of us has any idea what the true origins of humanity are. We have pieces, pieces that have been broken by the victors of countless wars. </p>

<p>If something I say in this letter offends you, good. This information is offensive, its damning, its tragic, and its hard to hear. But, its the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;The truth shall set you free&quot;</p>

<p>We believe that civilization began about 6,000 years ago, in a place once called Sumer; now known as Iraq. The history books tell us this. This is a lie. Geological evidence of erosion from Stonehenge suggests that it was erected somewhere between 500,000 to 1,000,000 years ago. It is a well known fact that the Sphinx in Egypt is well over 20,000 years old. Gold mines in Africa have been discovered in over a dozen countries that simply must have been dug tens of thousands of years ago, yet they are cut through the Earth with such precision; our modern technology and all its glory could not re-create the efficiency.</p>

<p>These are just a few basic examples of how our history is much older, and much stranger than the history books at your University allow you to think. </p>

<p>If you looked into these topics deeply, with an open mind; you would begin to see a pattern. The pattern is such: someone makes a discovery, someone else verifies the discovery, someone more powerful then enters the situation (like a Museum or a government, or someone with &quot;authority&quot;) and takes the discovery away, or makes it out to be a hoax, or outright steals and conceals it.</p>

<p>Such has been the case with literally tens of thousands of discoveries throughout just the last few centuries.</p>

<p>The purpose of all this secrecy?</p>

<p>The purpose is to keep you small, to make you small, to make you feel like a stranger on your own planet, to jeopardize your relationships with other people when you ask scary questions, to vilify you in social circles, to discredit the honest researcher, etc. </p>

<p>The purpose is control.</p>

<p>A long time ago, at an undisclosed date, (We&#39;re talking tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years ago) what we&#39;ll call the &quot;Priest Class&quot; arose in a forgotten civilization. You could call it Atlantis, you could call Old Egypt; it doesn&#39;t matter; we&#39;re talking about the same people. These men made discoveries about nature, reality, physics, geometry, time, philosophy, and spirituality that today would blow our minds. </p>

<p>For what I imagine was a long time, mankind flourished. It was a golden age.</p>

<p>Something happened. We&#39;ll call it X. X entered the situation. X could be a dark spirit, X could be aliens, X could be Satan himself, X could be just a really bad guy who got greedy.</p>

<p>X did something to us. </p>

<p>X took the knowledge from the people and entrusted it unto to Priest Class. This corrupted the Priest Class to the core, because &quot;absolute power corrupts, absolutely.&quot;</p>

<p>The rest folks, &quot;is history.&quot;</p>

<p>They scattered our people to the wind, they destroyed our sacred knowledge and gathered it into vaults and underground bases, they hid our true power and dignity from us, they confused us with different languages, cultures, and religions to keep us fighting each other, they wounded the planet&#39;s spirit and imprisoned her in a near-never ending cycle of destruction, they, over time, stole all of the world&#39;s mineral wealth and hid it from us; allowing us to starve and cannibalize each other out of desperation.</p>

<p>We are their slaves. This is a letter from a man who wishes to break the chains. We are ALL slaves. Even if you can&#39;t see it, you will. They are seeking to overtly enslave us AGAIN. The internet is too powerful, its too much freedom and connection between the various groups of slaves.</p>

<p>They made a mistake.</p>

<p>We have to capitalize on that mistake.</p>

<p>I will die for you.</p>

<p>Will you die for me?</p>

<p>Sincerely, a friend</p>

<p>He will tell it all correctly until he gets to morality. His view of &quot;absolute&quot; morality is daunting, as a former satanist he should know better.
Morality is founded on reciprocation ( socio-historically ), you owe no code of behaviour to those who haven&#39;t got one.
His speculations on the topic are likely to get low-IQ dissidents lined up for the reaping when time comes.
That said, all the rest he says is spot on.</p>

<p>Can you expand on this?</p>

<p>From what I understand, he argues that it&#39;s never OK to harm someone unless they started it. Self-defense is always moral but initiating violence is rarely, if ever moral.</p>

<p>That seems like reciprocated morality to me. But perhaps I&#39;m misunderstanding your gripe with his views on morality. </p>

<p>Again nobody knows everything, so for what it&#39;s worth he&#39;s one of the best researchers I&#39;ve found who speaks logically while explaining his ideas with the most concise linguistics possible. He isn&#39;t 100% correct, nobody is. But he&#39;s close enough that I listen to his talks more frequently than anyone else</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is his while his worldview generally is pretty gnostic and truth based his view on morality look like generic christian approach, which is quite dumbed down ( he shed light on many things christianity dumbed down, but not this one curiously ).</p>

<p>If everyone around you would kill randomly it would be &quot;moral&quot; ( or: not immoral ) for you to ambush and kill first someone ( state of war - no1 owes another anything ). Obviously that&#39;s not the case of our society but - an &quot;absolutistic&quot; approach to the matter is dangerous to carry because it&#39;s just too simple to work well. Expecially in the current tense situation.
But what i meant in the specific is his way to make this &quot;morality&quot; some kind of political activism ( i heard him often say that the enlightened has a moral duty to enlighten others as a result ).
This is the kind of stance that can become very costy very soon. As a former high ranking satanist i would expect him to be wiser if he was that well intentioned on the matter. Then again this is just my opinion, i don&#39;t claim i got any certainty about him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very interesting. Can you explain more? Specifically contrasting your views of morality vs his views. </p>

<p>Do you think there is no such thing as morality? Because that seems to be what satanism is &quot;do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law&quot;.. but you mentioned that morality is based on reciprocation... I&#39;d love to know more</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He says the enlightened has a moral obligation to extend the light. While i can see this is a noble act, it is so because i don&#39;t see it as an obligation. It&#39;s noble because he had the option not to and he still does.
It&#39;s sort of when dumbed-down christians ( many religions it applies to, i take christianity because it&#39;s so spread and known and studied in the west ) say we have to be behave with nobility and humility because only then we will deserve to enter heaven. 
Well how is it humble to rationally plan your way into heaven ? how is it noble ? those who took the thing literally are clearly just acting in their own interest, their contributions do not come from a &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;humble&quot; place ( obviously i can see how this kind of mythology can lead to good outcomes socially but still... let&#39;s go on ).</p>

<p>So when you advice the enligthened to go around spreading the light like some sort of STW &quot;social truth warrior&quot; you actually disarm the only defense the normal citizen has from TPTB ( hiding in a very big mass ) and can pick him freely.
Also most people aren&#39;t really noble and value the influx of power much more than truth. We all do this at some degree, your mileage may vary, but even if you would rather have truth than power you can see by simply browsing r/conspiracy that there&#39;s no chance to spread truth without power. Meanwhile a very powerful individual or group could spew all the bullshit they want and be believed while you would only make the local news as the last mad man that got caught spreading bullshit.</p>

<p>So as Jesus say &quot;be wise as serpents amidst the wolves&quot; and don&#39;t just lay down your good rabbit card before it can change something.</p>

<p>To me the best strategy is to chill until the situation is so fucked up that there will be no chances of fake groups or LHs going around because people effectively starve now. Until then the mass will believe they got a shot at power and lie down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s extremely sad and i hope someone good can get hands on power, but until that happens i believe the best shot is just to grind power, influence and be selectively subtle about how you spread the light. This is not a war that nobility can win anytime soon. Passio would have you crusade and be easily spottable.
I may be wrong about him, i just saw the natural law seminar and 3-4 hours worth of other stuff. Still he looked clear on his &quot;moral stance&quot; in these times.. idk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all very interesting. One thing I&#39;ll say about Mark is that in an armed conflict I trust that he&#39;s on our side. IMO the more people openly stating their defiance, the better. I agree with you that masking among the herd is best rate for survival. </p>

<p>The last thing I&#39;d like to ask you is on your stance of morality. You say it&#39;s a reciprocated thing... &quot;you owe no code of behavior to those who haven&#39;t got one&quot;</p>

<p>Can you expand on this? I&#39;m not talking about morality during war vs peacetime... I mean morality as an objective thing. Does it exist? You seem to think yes, but it&#39;s reciprocally subjective to each person... is this correct? I&#39;d like to know your views on absolute objective morality</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Oh hey if I make up a bunch of conjectured claims and link them all together, they must be true right!?&quot;. </p>

<p>There is no evidence that remotely supports Stonehenge being 500,000+ years old what so ever, indeed Cro-Magnon Man did not begin to settle Europe until ~40,000 years ago. </p>

<p>Erosion patterns on the sphinx and surrounded pit suggest the presence of water erosion. This would place it back in the Old Dynasty era, around 5,000 years ago (current theory suggests it was built ~4,000). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you looked into these topics deeply, with an open mind; you would begin to see a pattern</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phrase seems to pop up a lot on this thread. It translates most effectively into &quot;If you utterly disregard any evidence that you don&#39;t particularly like or understand then obviously it was Aliens/The Illuminati/Rothschild/Zionists!!!!&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose is to keep you small, to make you small</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes of course because if humanity knew that it had been around in 150,000BC building stone artefacts that would... uh... yeah that would be total social revolution baby, the new world order would crumble away under that knowledge!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the &quot;Priest Class&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stratification of society during the formation of larger settlements and development of more advanced agricultural techniques is not a secret. In fact it&#39;s pretty standard anthropology. You also have the rise of a warrior class to enforce the priestly demands and thus the birth of class conflict around the same era. But of course you already know this right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These men made discoveries about nature, reality, physics, geometry, time, philosophy, and spirituality that today would blow our minds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So mindblowing that nothing they built lasted? That not one trace of their glorious civilization remains? Sorry, this just isn&#39;t how human development works. We want from building small towns and cities in the Hilly Flanks circa 13,000BCE all for it to disappears in 12,500 with the Younger Dryas, yet within 3,000 years we see formalized cities with God-Kings, well established social narratives, and extensive agriculture. Why was your older civilization not able to re-establish? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something happened. We&#39;ll call it X.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even bother with this. If you need to introduce concepts like Satan to back up what is already just a string of utterly unsupported statements then you clearly don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. What about climatic change? What about disease? But no, you need to satisfy you&#39;re pseudo-intellectual-spiritual mumbo-jumbo so we&#39;re left with &#39;evil&#39; being the only possible cause that your fantasy civilization had to collapse. </p>

<p>All your doing is walking the party line, and I&#39;m not impressed.</p>

<p>How did the sarsen stones already erode 2  1/2 feet if Stonehenge was built in the last few thousand years. That makes literally no sense. How did ancient people with no technology do something we would have great difficulty doing todady? More importantly, why? Seems like a lot of effort to me.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;X&quot; goes, you clearly, grossly misunderstood what I was saying. Its a metaphor. I DON&#39;T KNOW, NEITHER DO YOU.
Is god real? Is there life after death? Are we god? What is the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you understood how volatile the climate of Earth was...you would understand why there is little evidence of past civilizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many civilizations in the past across the world have collapsed due to rapid shifts in climate that they were unable to adapt to. I have read numerous books on this issue of which I&#39;d recommend Diamond&#39;s <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/plape/pacificarchaut12/Diamond%20-%20Collapse-Chapter%202.pdf"><em>Collapse</em></a> as a great starting point. The point being each of these civilizations, down to the earliest town-settlers of Jericho have left ample archaeological evidence of their rise and fall. If an advanced civilization as you described existed we would have far more archaeological evidence. I openly believe in many aspects of the so-called &#39;alternative&#39; history model of their being settled peoples with organized societies long before many mainstream scholars are willing to accept but it is people like you who ensure we remain a laughing stock. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re you there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No and neither were you or anyone else who can comment, therefore we have to base our theories on physical evidence. There is no physical evidence of human settlement of this region prior to the time I mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>regurgitated Darwin theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has nothing to do with evolutionary theory. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All your doing is walking the party line, and I&#39;m not impressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right so you literally don&#39;t care about basing your reasoning on evidence then. Good to know. Just because something is not accepted within the mainstream does not make it worth investigating. As I said above I am a firm believer in several theories that have been presented and subsequently backed by physical evidence (Gobekli Tepe being the prime example of this). What you are doing is creating pure conjecture then attempting to find tid-bits of evidence which vaguely support your ideas then throwing ad-homs at anyone who disagrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did the sarsen stones already erode 2 1/2 feet if Stonehenge was built in the last few thousand years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the stones were not excavated but were glacial erratics that were then dragged over from Wales. Who knows how many thousands of years they were sat in some Welsh glacial valley exposed to the elements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did ancient people with no technology do something we would have great difficulty doing todady?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually a structure like Stonehenge can be built fairly easily. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYQBDhkBfr0">great video on some of the techniques likely used</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I DON&#39;T KNOW, NEITHER DO YOU</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why are you trying to assert that there was some kind of golden age that was ruined by this mysterious X? </p>

<p>I bet if you were willing to shape you opinions on evidence rather than vice versa you would have a better idea of what I am talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I find the theory attractive, and I&#39;m not averse to the sentiments expressed, further I agree that we are slaves to the system and that there is a better system, and it&#39;s up to us to find it, declare it and implement it, I find the specific details which underlie your theory to be somewhat vague, kind of fluffy and hard to pin down, and I suspect unsubstantiated or substantiated only by youtube videos or &quot;documentaries&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an example of what I mean; I watched the documentary series &quot;The Pyramid Code&quot; which discussed theories that sound very similar to what you describe. One of it&#39;s core theories is that the pyramids were in effect, gigantic batteries or power generators of some sort, which somehow used the structures of the underlying rock along with water from the Nile to concentrate electricity into the pyramids. To my mind, if this is true, it should be relatively simple to reproduce a working model of the pyramid power generators on a smaller scale, and measure the electrical charge of the structure. No one has actually done this, to my understanding, which makes me suspect that it&#39;s not actually possible.</p>

<p>You say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such has been the case with literally tens of thousands of discoveries throughout just the last few centuries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have certainly heard hundreds of similar claims, and studied many of them with care. Every single one of these claims was fraudulent. Give us just one example; make it your best, so that can examine it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m confident that your intentions are good and your heart is pure, but I suspect that you&#39;ve been taken in by some new-agey feel good cultish sciency babble myths that abound on the internet. My fear is this: we must live our lives by what we know and believe to be true; we must do what is right. If we do the right things, but we do them for the wrong reasons, we are setting ourselves up for failure; because doing the right things worked, we now believe our reasons are right; we become righteous. When we become righteous we are willing to cause suffering to others in the belief that our reasons and our actions are unassailable; thus our righteousness leads us down a path that can very easily become twisted and evil.</p>

<p>You are asking us to examine our assumptions; this is good and right. Be wary of assuming your own assumptions are unassailable; you may be standing on quicksand and assuming it&#39;s as solid as a pyramid.</p>

<p>As far as the &quot;documentaries&quot; and &quot;new-agey&quot; stuff goes, I could not despise anything more. I am aware of just how skewed this information can be, and that&#39;s why I applied in simple, vague terms.</p>

<p>As far as the pyramid thing goes; I don&#39;t know its a mystery.</p>

<p>How did a few thousand laborers carry those stones? Do you know how much they weigh? The theories about its electrical and metaphysical properties interest me, but I don&#39;t go so far as to say I fully understand them; I haven&#39;t seen or touched them myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate both of your comments.  I also sympathize with the idea that we&#39;re all coming increasingly under the control of a system that&#39;s way past the point of redeeming.  Exemplified by the popularity of &quot;non-establishment&quot; candidates in the coming US election, it feels like there is growing feeling that we&#39;ve reached some critical mass of people&#39;s ability to accept the standard BS, and that we&#39;re due for some major change.  </p>

<p>However, from a skeptical point of view, throughout history it always seems like there are millenarian movements predicting great change, that rarely see their predictions come to fruition.  Maybe this time it&#39;s somehow quantitatively/qualitatively different due to the sheer number of people worldwide accessing this information via the internet.  I don&#39;t know, but I definitely recognize my own risk of confirmation bias here on r/conspiracy.  (I also worry that if we can perceive growing dissatisfaction, more organized and directed groups certainly can as well and would attempt to manipulate it to their advantage).  </p>

<p>I find the idea that humans have a vastly more advanced level of technology/spirituality as our heritage compared to our current level of debasement to be very attractive.  But from what I understand of societal development, a dedicated priestly/researcher class requires division of labor and specialization, which require an agricultural society that produces a caloric surplus above the requirements of agricultural laborers themselves, which can support dedicated researchers.  Even the most primitive agricultural societies generally seem to leave artifacts in the form of durable materials that bear evidence of human shaping, and I would also expect there to be some genetic evidence of selective breeding of domesticated flora and potentially fauna that would pre-date our current timeline for the agricultural revolution.  </p>

<p>Maybe the agricultural paradigm is completely wrong for understanding a potential precursor civ, but whatever paradigm of societal development that is would be radically different than our observed history to have not left any observable artifacts.  I&#39;ve had some pretty radical experiences on psilocybin mushrooms, maybe it was hunter-gatherers making radical intuitive discoveries using the mind-altering properties of natural substances, but that would be truly extraordinary haha.  If &quot;TPTB&quot; have the power to suppress essentially all evidence of artifacts other than the Sphinx and Stonehenge, I&#39;m not sure what information there is that I could trust that isn&#39;t verified by my own experience.</p>

<p>We have to use discernment.</p>

<p>As far as the agricultural revolution goes; my theory is that agriculture is really where belong; we belong making our own food, living in peaceful, familial communities, and sharing our resources. Tribal people tend to be happier.</p>

<p>This part is just straight retarded. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A long time ago, at an undisclosed date, (We&#39;re talking tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years ago) what we&#39;ll call the &quot;Priest Class&quot; arose in a forgotten civilization. You could call it Atlantis, you could call Old Egypt; it doesn&#39;t matter; we&#39;re talking about the same people. These men made discoveries about nature, reality, physics, geometry, time, philosophy, and spirituality that today would blow our minds.</p>

<p>For what I imagine was a long time, mankind flourished. It was a golden age.</p>

<p>Something happened. We&#39;ll call it X. X entered the situation. X could be a dark spirit, X could be aliens, X could be Satan himself, X could be just a really bad guy who got greedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said. Thanks for the summary.  I want to add that when you look at the things that the &quot;priest caste&quot; finds the very most repugnant and makes the most taboo is what is the biggest threat to them, and which is probably the &quot;way out&quot; of their oppression.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s the psychedelics. </p>

<ul>
<li>DMT</li>
<li>Mushrooms (similar molecule to dmt)</li>
</ul>

<p>The gnostic superclass gets to hide out in the shadows using these as a tool, while preventing outgroups from having access to them.  Freemasons love to come and attack this idea because they are low level.  High levels just won&#39;t talk about it, or won&#39;t give the idea any audience.  </p>

<p>This is a perfect Janus face of the Roman empire that persists to this day (it never died).  We know this becauase Terence McKenna spilled the beans.  So did the Rosicrucians; so did the alchemists.  It&#39;s written all over if you learn to read the signs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acacia leaf in freemasonry -- acacia contains DMT</li>
<li>Mushrooms encoded in freemasonic symbols and catholic symbols, motifs</li>
<li>Amanita and psilocybe mushrooms are steganographically encoded into many many works of christian art</li>
<li>Orobouros the snake eating the tail and gaining crown and wings -- this is the &#39;snake&#39; of christiantiy.  Sorry for the spoiler.  It&#39;s Quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent.  It&#39;s a program that plays out when you take mushrooms.  You are swallowed by a cosmic serpent, spiral around until you get to the center of it all.  And there you find great wisdom, possibly taking flight with the dragon.  Spoiler!</li>
<li>Freemason Checkerboard is a closed eye visuals effect everyone experiences with onset of mushroom trip.  Stunning Geometries are also what happens as it intensifies.  That&#39;s another reason they worship &#39;sacred geometry&#39;, not just to make mandalas for hanging in windows.</li>
<li>Santa claus and reindeers and all the christmas motifs are hidden information about the amanita muscaria that grows under conifers which were collected and hung in the trees to dry (ornaments for the tree), because only when the mushroom is dry can it be consumed safely for the &#39;trip&#39;.  Reindeers because they preferentially eat amanita muscaria.  Red and white of santa are amanita colors.</li>
<li> Holy grail was a wooden cup with &#39;lamb of god&#39; ie: innoculated with mycelium of amanita muscaria, just add water and it perpetually creates more &#39;white wool&#39; within the cup, &quot;ambrosia&quot;, as psychoactive as the mushroom.  This lamb is created from dried bits of mushroom, suggesting the mushroom ressurrects itself.</li>
<li>UFOs are a very common motif associated with psychedelics, interacting with alien entities.  Some people come back with some very interesting insight.  What if someone doesn&#39;t want you (government / crown / pope) to come back with any special, potentially world-changing insights (Nikola Tesla).</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>You know psychedlics are taboo for several reasons.  1) the cabal is running both sides of the war on drugs, namely peddling opiods as it&#39;s the biggest revenue earner, and science proves that psychedelics shatter addiction to all drugs.  LSD and ketamine break alcohol addiction; Ketamine and ibogaine break opiod addiction.  Very likely psilocybin can work in some capacity on both addictions, but it also breaks addiction to unhappiness (depression).  They want to keep selling their bad drugs to you.  They don&#39;t want you to get your hands on the antidote. </p>

<p>2) This knowledge that OP talks about is accessible through contemplation of ecclectic gnostic wisdom, meditation, but the real awakening happens through altered states of consciousness. That&#39;s where the real magick happens.  Which, in metaphysical terms, is using the mind to open doorways, to take new subway routes of your reality; in scientific terms, to access a quantum indeterminacy of reality and using attention, intention and will (magick) choose the reality you want versus the one that will happen by default.  This is one thing they know and do not want you to know.  That magick is actually real and it doesn&#39;t work in the way you think (copperfield).</p>

<p>Yes you <em>can</em> pull a red blanket from the aether, but no one will ever know..because although the universe autocorrects itself on your behalf, from other&#39;s perspective the red blanket was always there. This is not solipsism, this is reality as a mutable but ad-hoc consensus with the possibility of quantum derangement of self-limited scope.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you can&#39;t prove magic is real: you&#39;re the only one who made it through that hoop into a reality in which it always happened.... from a reality in which it didn&#39;t and never would.</p>

<p>This kind of thing got people burned at the stake.  Scoff!  Thinking magick is real.  They never will allow common man the technology of magic.  They can only have officially sanctioned technology fire and earth, of the material realm.  Not the one of wind and water.</p>

<p>Again, what is the evidence behind these claims?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gold mines in Africa have been discovered in over a dozen countries that simply must have been dug tens of thousands of years ago, yet they are cut through the Earth with such precision; our modern technology and all its glory could not re-create the efficiency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple application of the scientific method should help with the first two.</p>

<p>The center block of Stonehenge is broken and has suffered massive erosion, the sarsen stones simply could not have broken down this quickly, to crack and break outright from erosion. Micheal Tellinger goes into this more deeply if you want a name dropped. How did ancient Celtic &quot;barbarians&quot; move these multi-ton stones and erect them in such a way, in the first place?</p>

<p>The Sphinx is literally public knowledge; the populace just doesn&#39;t care. The water erosion levels are about 5-7 times higher than that of the surrounding city ruins. Many researchers believe it used to be on an island.</p>

<p>As far as Africa goes, I&#39;m goin on hearsay. I just know from my own research that Africa, especially East and South Africa have VAST deposits of gold; that have of course been stolen by the British Empire and placed under lock and key.</p>

<p>Amid those times in the 1800&#39;s when the Empire was digging, many Boer farmers and African natives reported these ancient mines.</p>

<p>The reptilian brain, the oldest of the three, controls the body&#39;s vital functions such as heart rate, breathing, body temperature and balance. Our reptilian brain includes the main structures found in a reptile&#39;s brain: the brainstem and the cerebellum.</p>

<p>The limbic brain emerged in the first mammals. It can record memories of behaviours that produced agreeable and disagreeable experiences, so it is responsible for what are called emotions in human beings. The main structures of the limbic brain are the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reptilian brain is a myth that should not be taken seriously and yet is referred to by many writers and is even seen in educational sites for children. It is the idea that we have three brains: a reptilian one, the paleomammalian one and the mammalian one. The story goes that these were acquired one after another during evolution. The details differ with the writer. But it is all a myth based on an idea from the ’70s of Paul MacLean which he republished in 1990. Over the years in has been popularized by Sagan and Koestler among others. (Source: <a href="http://dyslectern.info/2014/03/09/do-we-have-a-reptilian-brain/">Dyslectern.info</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with using the imagination to think about theories, ideas, and possibilities.  Not every discussion has to be based in such strict terms of logic and mainstream sources.  Sometimes the way to new knowledge is through conjecture.  Einstein had no proof of his theories when he used his imagination to make leaps in his thinking.  There a time to settle into logic and proof and a time to let imagination take you into different realms of thought.  I always wonder why some people get so angry about people practicing the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a lot of respect for what you&#39;re saying.  The willingness to challenge prevailing beliefs and norms is, well, revolutionary, and a major step in the right direction.  I wish more people did it.  I&#39;d be glad to talk to you about this.</p>

<p>But I think that you&#39;re factually incorrect in several ways.</p>

<p>First of all, I think your perspective on ancient monuments isn&#39;t quite right.  To really get how they were made you need to understand that they were made over a really, really long period of time with a tremendous amount of human effort.  When you think about many thousands of people spending years and years hauling stone blocks around the scale makes a lot more sense.  It also makes sense that they were built in Egypt, which is a country where there were a lot of farmers who didn&#39;t really have a lot to do during flooding season when they couldn&#39;t work the fields.</p>

<p>Some sort of conspiracy behind ancient human history also seems improbable, just because of the vast amount of primary historical sources that are available.  If you care to you can easily read Herodotus, The Commentaries of Caesar, etc., even in their original languages if you learn them.   I think there&#39;s a great deal of manipulation behind our interpretations of history, what we focus on, how we teach it, things like that, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any conspiracy behind the fundamental facts of history.</p>

<p>When it comes to the BIG ONE, the grand conspiracy, I think you&#39;re taking a modern phenomenon and trying to think that it&#39;s ancient. </p>

<p>I agree very much with you about people being controlled, there being an existence of a &quot;master class&quot; that manipulates the world on a grand scale, etc.  But I don&#39;t think it was like this forever.</p>

<p>My understanding is that in the era following World War 2, ideological and economic control became much more important than the kinds of empire thought that people followed in past eras.  This was an age where nation states became subordinate to other, more globalist concerns.</p>

<p>I call this the age of &#39;Worldview Warfare&#39; between Communism and Capitalism, which ended with Capitalism winning and becoming the de facto ruling ideology of the entire world.  That&#39;s the world we&#39;re living in today- we&#39;re essentially subjects of a single power, the power of the &quot;World Bank&#39;.</p>

<p>Manpower, yes.  Effort, some, but not as much as most of us think.  Time, not so much either.  Decades, maybe; not centuries.</p>

<p>The Egyptians had an entire science which has been buried; but in terms of things which you are likely to be willing to accept, they had a much more advanced understanding of the principle of leverage, than we do.  By that I mean how to move big rocks around.  I&#39;m not talking about teleportation or anything weird, either; it&#39;s just taking high school physics knowledge of gravity and going a bit further with it than we usually do.</p>

<p>The Egyptians weren&#39;t the only ones; the Olmecs in South America have made stone monuments which modern engineering can&#39;t replicate, as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are some things which they don&#39;t mind being out in the open, because even though said things might help people learn to think for themselves, said things generally also aren&#39;t very interesting to most people, (like Greek philosophy) and so they don&#39;t need to worry about them being known.  There are other things which are out, but in bits and pieces and scraps, so if you want to know about them you have to get one bit from here, and another bit from there, and then hope that you&#39;ve put them together in the right order.  It&#39;s like reconstructing the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they bother keeping that much stuff locked away.  Some, yes; but only the really world-ending or paradigm shattering stuff.  It&#39;s too much effort, apart from anything else.  It&#39;s easier to just brainwash people into being ignorant, apathetic morons so that even if a UFO did land in front of them, they&#39;d be too busy posting selfies on Facebook to care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something which is vitally important to understand here, is that the only priority that most people have, is the need to belong to the collective.  Social isolation is an intensely intimidating and painful thing; I speak from direct personal experience.  The more tightly cohesive technology makes said collective, the more true this is going to be.</p>

<p>The only people who are likely to be interested in your information, are people who have already been rejected by the larger collective, like myself.  The only means atheists have of enforcing belief in evolutionary theory, for example, is social ostracision; but when, like me, you&#39;ve already been an outcast for most of your life anyway, that has no hold over you.</p>

<p>While I agree with pretty much everything that you&#39;ve written, I don&#39;t do what you have here.  I tried to for a very brief time, but I was rapidly shown that the only thing other people really want is to belong, and they can&#39;t do that after they have changed their belief system in ways that are unacceptable to others.</p>

<p>Most people just want to leave home, find a partner, get a house, have kids, work for 60 years or so, and then die; and they don&#39;t want any information which will conflict with their ability to do that.  So I&#39;ve made a conscious decision to let them.</p>

<p>Also; look into the diamond shape, and by that I mean a four sided diagonal rectangle, not the other one.  The recently popularised version of vertex-based mathematics that is floating around is not entirely accurate, and its&#39; promoter is far too sure of himself, but I think he is still somewhat on the right track.  Look at the logo of Freemasonry; the Masons are very fond of hiding their secrets in plain sight, and that may just be their downfall.</p>

<p>I appreciate this, very, very much.  It has been hard sometimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you subscribe to the idea that we&#39;re in some kind of simulation, some kind of living computer program, as prisoners?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is a simulation, but we are not prisoners.  I realised during my last mushroom trip that the reason why the system is a simulation, is because it <strong><em>has</em></strong> to be; and ironically, that is the precise reason why we are <strong><em>not</em></strong> prisoners.</p>

<p>The definition of reality is something which you do not like, but are unable to change.  Think about that.  When someone wins the lottery, you will never hear anyone saying, &quot;that&#39;s just reality.&quot;  We only say that when something happens that we don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>So from there, the only possible way that the system could be fair, (and I believe that it has been designed to be fair, although that also implies a definition of fairness which is probably unfamiliar to most people) is if it is organised as a series of infinitely recursive hallucinations; infinite in every possible direction.</p>

<p>The reason why it can&#39;t be &quot;real,&quot; is because again, reality implies that there is something which is arbitrarily there, which you can&#39;t change.  So if anything was real, then that would be the point in the system where everyone would get stuck.  If anything was real, then death could not exist; because literally all death is, is the means by which we transition from one virtual reality scenario to the next.  We <strong><em>would</em></strong> be prisoners if we did not have death.  </p>

<p>Remember when they gave Jodie Foster the suicide pill in <em>Contact.</em>  That&#39;s what death is.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s for.  It&#39;s our last resort ejection button for when things get intolerably bad, or for when we want to shift to another scenario which is not reachable by any other means from our current one.  The only difference between suicide and &quot;natural&quot; death, is that in the latter case, you eject with the consent and co-operation of your actual soul and the rest of the system, when it has been decided by more than just you that it is the right time.  With suicide, it&#39;s just the conscious ego personality making the decision on its&#39; own, and that can really piss lots of other people off, because the soul might have made arrangements to do lots of other things before leaving.</p>

<p>The reason why I&#39;m also saying to look into the diamond shape, is because I think the diamond might be the geometric basis of observable reality.  Not so much a diamond as a torus, yes; but four diamonds stuck together, make a torus with straight sides.  Stack up enough of them at different scales, and you can use the resulting nodal points to simulate whatever other shapes you like.</p>

<p>Theory.  Not sure if it&#39;s true yet.  Not tested.  But we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>False. The technologies used involved levitating the massive stones. No man power required. They didn&#39;t &quot;haul&quot; the stones around. Also, the people living in Egypt for the last few thousand years had nothing to do with the construction of the ancient pyramids. Those structures were already there. This is true of many ancient stone sites in many parts of the world including Peru, Ecuador, Mexico etc.

    <div class="md"><p>People hardly ever ask <em>why</em> the ancients built with such gigantic stones.  When we build, it&#39;s with manageable pieces that we put together to make a structure.  We don&#39;t build with huge multi-ton pieces because it&#39;s so much harder to do it that way.  Our biggest modern cranes could not move some of the stones that the ancients moved around.  So why did the ancients like the Egyptians,  who did not even invent the wheel yet,  build a pyramid out of these huge stones instead of using smaller stones?  When you think about this it seems to me that for these people working this way was somehow easy for them.  So why was it so easy for them?  What did they know that we don&#39;t know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>every one has will . whether or not we have free will is disputed .</p>

<p>some say God has a plan for every man . some don&#39;t believe he exists . hes an absent land lord .. or is he ? he moves in mysterious ways is another saying ..</p>

<p>if he created Adam and Eve and placed them in a garden he already had a plan in motion .</p>

<p>keep away from the tree , do not eat its fruit ... God knows the mind of man as God created him .. God put the tree there for his own childish game .. love thy God .. love no other God but him .. live under his rule and obey his law .. what law ? I dont see a book of the law .. or do i ? nature has its own laws .</p>

<p>curiosity killed the cat .. but it also killed man when he ate the apple and became mortal ..</p>

<p>again .. Gods plan ? what a jerk ... I&#39;m God i can do what i want ..</p>

<p>I&#39;m God i can do what i want...</p>

<p>this right here is where it all goes wrong for mankind .. any one seeking to enslave people through superstition or fear of the dark/unknown will use this .. i am God i can do what i want and there is nothing YOU can do to stop me .. i rule for agar .. you can not see me . you can not prove i exist nor prose i do not exist but the fear of either is enough to keep you inline..</p>

<p>my priest hood will take from you a % of wages .. just like all the other religions but i am the only true god .. i am God .. worship no other god before me ..</p>

<p>for thousands of years war ripped apart  many civilizations , but one thing remained and evolved .. slavery through religion ,
the catholic church has the slavery through religion down , they nailed it .. fear God because he is a loving gentle god , he gave his son for you , obey him and live for ever .. dont track the stars through the sky as this will reveal the world is not flat and for get the zodiac as we will show you when to plant crops . we will show you how to heal so forget mother nature and worship the father ..</p>

<p>throughout history wars raged against idol worship .. these cultures knew the secrets of the zodiac , nature , healing , chakras , lay lines , the earths power , earth&#39;s meridian and the meridian  of the human body . man kept these secrets in secret societies .. they had to be kept secret .. they were dangerous and powerful , they reveal mans true nature .. and mans true nature has no place in Gods plan ..I&#39;m God i can do what i want ..</p>

<p>secret societies know the human body , they know the secrets of nature and the power of the flower of life , they say it was given to man by the Devil Satan to free him from Gods boundaries as the church was working hand in hand with Gods plan , keeping man subdued and in chains  but they do not worship Satan or God they worship a being named Lucifer , who was an angel , an angel who came to eatch and gave him the flower of life and other esoteric knowledge .. who not worship Satan ? it came from him / why not worship God as this may have been part of Gods plan ? who knows .. if it was part of his plan then why ? is it the same I&#39;m God i can do what i want crap again / the illusion of free will ? make a choice to be part of the idol worshipers and dont go to heaven or worship Christ and do go to heaven  ? if all we have to do is renounce and worship Christ on our deathbed why the bullshit ? is it a test ? </p>

<p>I&#39;m God i can do what i want and this is what i am doing .. big joke ,, its on us .. do you get it ? do what thy will shal be the whole of the law ... a motto of occultists .. its all part of the same bullshit God threw at us .. you dont have to do jack shit .. follow a religion or secret society its all the same .. on your deathbed renounce it .. happy ever after .. here&#39;s a secret .. </p>

<p>no one on this site knows the truth .. no one will ever know it . dont go looking for it because you already know what you will and wont find .. the only thing you need to know is your self ..  be true to it .. everything a religion promise you .. you already have ..</p>

<p>but man is bound by society .. you cane ever truly be free .. freewill is ilusion of choice  . OCD keeps me from being free .. what stops you ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested but I&#39;m a little confused by what your saying. Are you suggesting that Paganism is a &quot;good&quot; thing? I happen to think so but I refrain from practicing magick because it is scary, it is powerful, and it is dangerous. I may eventually look more deeply into ritual and natural magicked, but for now I&#39;m content studying it. It sounds like you speaking of the &quot;demiurge&quot; of Gnosticism, in which, God is a jailer or a usurper who created the material world; a world that was never meant to be here in the first place. I have given this idea some thought, and can see some evidence for it; but I&#39;m confused about our place in it. If God really was good, why would &quot;he&quot; leave us here with all these insane murderers, rapists, and psychopaths? That&#39;s my question. I believe in free will to an extent and I believe in infinity; I believe in the multi-verse; that every choice, thought, feeling, and action I make creates an alternate world where those possibilities are explored. In that way, this is like a machine. Is God simply the engineer? </p>

<p>i believe the God was a created being much like ourselves . created by the holy spirit but had no way to learn but he could create .. by creating he is able to learn and is simply making mistakes and ignoring the harm and damage it is doing to humans or other forms of life much like we do ..</p>

<p>the way i see him is pure evil on one side and goodness and love on the other . he has to be for this shit to be real .. &quot;God is love&quot; so are dogs . love a dog and hes your best friend .. love and worship God and you can live for ever  . God does some fucked up shit .. dogs eat their own faeces ,  going to cut this part short ...</p>

<p>in my eyes God is only out for him self , lets face it .. how can a God of love allow people to rape kids .. murder them and eat them ? it is not God who punishes them its man who punishes man .. repent and live forever .. i do not believe in the 10 commandments or 7 sins .. i believe God gave man free will and thats that .. do what thy will be the whole of the law .. God made all . Gods plan and all that .. the way i look at life and everything else is .. i was born .. i can think , i walk , i eat to stay alive .. i am on a planet , its spinning around a sun ..  i am not alone ..  there are others .. many horrors to some .. fun and games to others , some want to control .. others become monks and shed off worldly goods .. but most settle for being part of a system set up by man .. not by any God .. it is not God who sets taxes ..  it is not God who commands us to go fight in another country as they worship the same God .. the system in that country may have a dictator but the country i live in has many .. i live in a country where freedom of religion means i can kill a person as a religious sacrifice and for my crime of murder it is hush hushed and only spoken of in the darker corners of society .. </p>

<p>what i learned in life is idol worship never ended .. men worship an idol and pretend to worship God .. behind the doors life is different to the man on the street . the occult is a dangerous path to take in life , the people behind the control system are organized and every where in every aspect of the system , but is it meant to be this way ? if God exists and he has a plan is this part of it ? is our planet meant to be a  school for God to learn ? the good and the bad ? is human life part of a bigger system where eventually all things under heaven will take place / every action that could happen will one day happen ? or is God just winging it not giving a fuck and those smart people in the past who think the way i do reach for power to control man as he knew God didnt exist ? but invented one to keep order in the fledgling society as God to one man is just an alien in a flying saucer to another ..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the kind words.</p>

<p>Our sources are probably along some of the same lines, I just have done a lot of meditation and research into it. I laid the foundation of spiritual and philosophical interest as an adolescent (my father has a MD in religion, history, and the ancient Greek language). Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, Herodotus, Cicero, etc: these were my heroes, not Superman and Batman (though you gotta love them as well).</p>

<p>As an adult I looked into Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Wicca, Paganism and host of other worldviews. </p>

<p>I have seen a large amount of connection between the various flavors of human experience. We&#39;re essentially all looking for the same thing: meaning.</p>

<p>I love Alan Watts, Phillip Dick, Terrence McKenna (though people should realize that he is a confessed CIA operative, one who went rogue and died for it; so some of his material is indeed a psyop) and many other fringe philosophers and teachers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in Aleister Crowley, because his influence on the occult world, not because of his character.</p>

<p>Anyway, it would be to long of a list to make a comprehensive report of the people and events I lend attention to, but I am primarily focused on physics, spirituality and magick; and the connections between these fields.</p>

<p>Good luck in your research.</p>

Obviously that&#39;s not the case of our society but - an &quot;absolutistic&quot; approach to the matter is dangerous to carry because it&#39;s just too simple to work well. Expecially in the current tense situation.
But what i meant in the specific is his way to make this &quot;morality&quot; some kind of political activism ( i heard him often say that the enlightened has a moral duty to enlighten others as a result ).
This is the kind of stance that can become very costy very soon. As a former high ranking satanist i would expect him to be wiser if he was that well intentioned on the matter. Then again this is just my opinion, i don&#39;t claim i got any certainty about him.</p>
