    <div class="md"><p>In no particular order... At sixteen, I was (briefly) the dispatch manager of the largest sofa manufacturer in the southern hemisphere. During my honors year, while working as a cleaner during the Commonwealth Games, I met Prince Phillip, who shook my hand and told me I should have paid more attention in school. I drove a Rolls Royce with a television in it for a boss when I had no license. I once lived in a house with four sheds on the property which were packed with hundreds of jars filled with human hair, screwed into lids affixed to the ceiling where there was room. I experienced a heap of strange shit in that house. I was once given $100 of lottery &quot;scratchies&quot; for my birthday and won nothing on 100 consecutive tickets.  </p>

<p>But yeah, definitely more shower thought than conspiracy... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn that&#39;s real bad luck to get 100 of those $1 scratches and not win once. Maybe if you got 50 of the $2 ones. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a stupidity tax but a mate professor said that the odds on scratches are better than lottery and to buy 10 of the $5 or $10 ones and it&#39;s bound to be worthwhile. Never tried it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real irony is that I really passionately hate the concept of lottery and the lotto culture it has fostered wherein people are willing to put up with gross injustice and division of wealth and power on the miniscule (nonexistent) chance that <em>they</em> personally <em>could</em> be the one in power one day. Not to mention the inverted lottery ticket relationship we seem to have with our environment as beings.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About 12 years ago, wife and I rented a strangely cheap inner-east cottage type place that we thought was cheap due to the god-awful carpets and hideous green paint throughout. It was a very old, cobbled-together house, with several tacked on rooms out the back, including Astroturf in several &quot;rooms&quot; and the bathroom floor. Bathroom had an inordinate amount of mirror for a shitty construction that felt more like a dodgy holiday home than something deserving of floor to ceiling mirrors. The property was long and narrow, and had no drainage, and all four roof sections pitched inward into property, so it tended to flood in the backyard (and occasionally the kitchen) every time it rained even lightly. The whole house was pitched at about 15 degrees (to the back and to one side), which made for funny moments when you would throw the ball inside for the dog.  </p>

<p>To the rear of the long yard was four sheds which all faced each other and had only enough room between them to just get the doors open. All four were locked and we had never been given keys for them. After a few months of living there, and having a mid-sized student party (the house was very close to my uni at the time), it got into our heads to just use a screwdriver and remove the latch system itself, leaving the locks intact. It was late, we were all drunk. We all sobered up pretty fucking quickly though. All the sheds were the same. Full of large jars of various sizes. There were some tables, but almost every conceivable space around them was filled with jars, all stacked meticulously to the roof, where the lids of jars had been nailed into the wood ceiling. The ceiling had been added to each shed (they were &quot;tin&quot; sheds), and the lids nailed upward, jars then screwed in. Full of human hair. We knew the property had been owned by an &quot;eccentric&quot; elderly couple of shut-ins. He had died a few years before her, and they had both died in the house. No kids, and a gnome garden out front. We would occasionally get random visitors knock at our door and tell us about their memories of the gnome garden out front. But here is where it gets really creepy: all the hair was quite different. At first we thought they might just have been paranoid about people doing voodoo on them using their own hair or whatever, and (naturally?) stored it to keep it safe from nefarious wizards. But there was all types of hair, and each jar seemed to be <em>packed</em> with hair, and not always of just one type. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all I can really remember, will ask my wife later tonight about her recollections and see if I can come up with more details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to get picked on alot when I was a freshman in highschool, and I mean alot. Pretty much everyone who could take a shot at me did when the oppurtunity arose partially cause I was new to the area and partially cause I was shy and kind of goofy looking at the time. </p>

<p>There was one time in particular my marketing class was on a bus to some DECA conference or something, and this one dude was just really digging into me and I was just trying my best not to let it get to me. All of a sudden this girl, who I believe was two grades ahead of me, turned around and said to the guy &quot;hey man, why don&#39;t you look him right in the eyes when you say that stuff to him, look him right in the eyes right now and ask him how that makes him feel cause I doubt it&#39;s very good.&quot; and he did ask me, and I told him it made me feel awful, he looked genuinely upset to hear this and never did it again. </p>

<p>I will never forget the kindness that girl showed me for the rest of my life. Pretty rare if you ask me.</p>

<li>I was brought to the hospital for unexplained chest pains. The doctors could not figure it out. My grand pa (who I was very close to), ended up having pneumonia, and later died. After he did, all chest pains disappeared. </li>
<li>Ringing in my ears, and gut feelings of sadness. Later, receiving calls about a family member who was hurt, or someone who desperately wanted to talk with me, but just &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot;, until then. Also receiving a call, which was impossible.</li>
<li>Met a spirit, something (idk). Who left a mark on my left side of my body. I feel it to this day. I was a kid, and walking in a crowd, lost my parents, and an old lady appeared in front of me. She looked old and very much not alive, but alive. She grabbed my left arm. Since then, my left side of my body just isn&#39;t the same. Sounds crazy, but something happened. I asked my brother did you see that? He said, what are you talking about, we were talking about the next hockey game. That experience, creeps me out the most. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>Had to look it up. Yes, I very well could be. Lots of strange shit has happened in my life. Most of it stems from the #3 event, because that was prior to any of the others. Got any more stuff I can read/watch about it? Never really checked out this type of stuff (always in the back of my mind though).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I&#39;ve only recently entertained the concept as by definition it describes my general response to things. I&#39;ve never seen anything like you described but I seem to be emotional on a slighting different frequency than those around me. I can&#39;t point you in any direction I&#39;ve been met with such duress from society about it that I can&#39;t seem to nail it down. This gets my &quot;backwards logic&quot; goin and I start to see an artificial narrative placed around the concept. You can&#39;t be special in a good way in our psychopath oriented society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, thanks for suggesting a word/theory. I&#39;ve always found things like this interesting, just never looked in that direction. Probably because I was religious for most of my life (ex-Catholic), in my mid twenties, I ditched religion and just became spiritual. I fancy history so I research/look in that direction, but stuff like this fascinates me. I&#39;ve always been a mediator in my life and for some reason, I can calm people down and bring people together, and truly feel the pain of others in ways both physical and mentally (I cannot describe it). There is definitely something to it. I believe our brains are transceivers, and a universal consciousness exists. Trippy shit, and I don&#39;t smoke weed or partake in hallucinogens, mind you ;). Maybe I should or shouldn&#39;t? Legalize it, and I&#39;ll see. ha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was mainly talking about shrooms or hallucinogens. I&#39;ve smoked weed, but makes me paranoid. I need to find a good strain, that doesn&#39;t (noob in weed). Regardless what some people say, though, a strong (pure) alcohol will give you the same effect, depending on the person. Also, absinthe, lol..... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I could probably write a short story about it, but for this post, I&#39;ll keep it short. </p>

<p>I was on a hockey trip (travel (AAA) ice hockey) as a kid (~11 years old) with my family in Chicago. We were walking in the downtown area shopping. I got lost in the crowd, and out of no where I see this old woman (like a homeless beggar), but she didn&#39;t look alive (thin face, thin body, what you would see from a dying cancer patient), yet there she was, looking at me, in a crowd of 100&#39;s of people. Time seemed to stopped. She didn&#39;t say anything, she just looked, and grabbed my arm. Her eyes, just spoke. It was as if she wanted me to know something, to tell me something, or to pass something to me. </p>

<p>It felt like a few hours passed, and this immense feeling of sympathy came over me. I cannot explain it. She disappeared, and it seem time started again. I look over and see my brother and parents in front of me. I asked my brother: &quot;Did you see that?&quot;, and he replied, basically: &quot;See what? We were talking the whole time about the next hockey game, we have to play tomorrow&quot;.</p>

<p>My left side, since then, has had this weird feeling. I shift my left side (near my ribs and hip), and walk a little different. People noticed this, as I grew up as a kid (and now). It&#39;s not debilitating or anything, it&#39;s just like an uncomfortable re-posturing. Really weird. Anyways. After this event, #1,#2 followed along with a laundry list of others.</p>

<p>What happened that day? No fucking idea. But, since then, a lot of weird shit has happened in my life, and some shit has come true, when in reality it shouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Edit: I should probably post to <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay you may have had a very strange paranormal phenomena. I&#39;d say she was a Fay. Are you familiar with Irish concept of faeries? Or the fairy land?</p>

<p>What you describe is was not all uncommon in the past. Look up encounters in the faerie land. Supposedly faeries take children and replace them with their own. Its called a cangeling. The whole black eyed children thing comes from this. It is said that Irish parents would name their young boys girls names to keep them from being taken. Hence Mallory was John Wayne&#39;s first name. And it makes you think about a boy named sue by Cash. </p>
