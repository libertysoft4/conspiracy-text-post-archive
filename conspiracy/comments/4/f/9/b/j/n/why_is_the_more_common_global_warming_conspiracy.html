    <div class="md"><p>Environmental Regulations can be avoided by elite corporations just like taxes, they have many ways out. They can pollute as much as they want just by buying carbon credits. Its not a problem to them. Small corporations have to suffer but not the elite MNCs. The same guys own fossil fuel industry who own the banks and who control the government so its not fossil fuel industry vs government. Fossil Feul giant Rockefeller founded Club of Rome was behind the current environmentalism crisis.</p>

<p>Here is a club of rome quote </p>

<p>“The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up 
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, 
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Just because there is a profit motive on one side doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t one on the other side.  It&#39;s like saying because one party is greedy, it&#39;s wrong, while not caring or bothering to examine the other party for greed or wrong-ness.  </p>

<p>In the case of global warming, now known as climate change; I&#39;ve read too much into meta-studies claiming &quot;consensus&quot; when no consensus actually exists.  This was highly illuminating to me, and I got a bad taste for global warming alarmists.  I also have a bad taste for greedy oil companies, but it doesn&#39;t mean they are wrong for downplaying the alarmism.  Do research yourself.  I urge you, if you are interested.  Start by reading Oreskes famous &quot;97% consensus&quot; and please post back here with what you found out when actually reading that paper.</p>

However, the sheer SCALE of this presumed eco-conspiracy is what makes it indefensible. As a foremer right-winger who isn&#39;t too proud to say that everything in that platform has been proven dead wrong so far, I can easily see how this one will follow suit and be just as dead wrong also. Ignoring the effects of a population explosion is very convenient for anyone who has the ability to isolate themselves, whether it be in a gated community in Costa Rica, a ski lodge in Aspen or a trailer park in Idaho. </p>

<li><p>This is case by case basis. Not every corporation that deals with fossil fuels is evil and wants to pollute the Earth. You cant blanket the idea that all of them are  evil.</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon dioxide is not a greenhouse gas. According to NASA, co2 isn&#39;t even dangerous to humans at all. What they are concerned with for some reason, is the high concentration within the atmosphere. But like many times throughout history, the sun is going through a hibernation phase, acting as a kind of balance.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again, this is case by case. Many people who lobby or police for the fuel industry might not even understand the idea of the sun being the major contributing factor to climate change. Many of them still may believe that humans and pollution are the major factor, but continue anyway because they are greedy and like the money.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What people need to understand is the sun is the major factor of climate. The whole &quot;global warming&quot; part of it is fake and I will tell you why: Ice Age. We know the Earth goes through an ice age every 10000 to 15000 thousand years, and we know that millions of years ago even as the dinosaurs have been on the Earth, there have been times with even higher concentrations of co2 in the atmosphere; yet every so often the sun goes into &quot;hibernation&quot; and the Earth cools, leading to an ice age.</p>

<p>The whole green movement is just a way for the industry leaders to concentrate power and but out competition, by lobbying for regulations like cap and trade. Which will ultimately kill small competition, much like increasing the minimum wage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, CO2 is not dangerous to humans; we create it exhale it, though we can&#39;t breathe it. Trees absorb it and give oxygen back.  The &quot;for some reason&quot; is that climate changes spurn the growth of anaerobic bacteria and that will fuck up our food supply. Turn the filter pump off in an aquarium and watch what happens; that&#39;s a microcosm. 
  None of this is terribly complicated; some people are just incapable of separating any issue from politics. Selfishness really blurs that line  between reality and conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said that co2 isn&#39;t dangerous. According to NASA themselves they claim it&#39;s not. I fully understand that co2 is NOT dangerous. The &quot;for some reason&quot; part is to why they are concerned with high concentrations of it, but not concerned with the gas itself. Doesn&#39;t make much sense to me, it seems like a contradiction on NASA part.</p>

<p>As far as climate change, I believe it&#39;s getting colder, and obviously changing in weather patterns and seasonal shifts will affect the food supply. I dont know much about the growing of anaerobic bacteria or how turning a filter off metaphorically equals to changes in climate or whatever, but I would think that if there were higher concentrations of co2 that would actually be better for crops and plant life. More co2 equals more oxygen etc etc. </p>

<p>As far as politics are concerned, op wanted to know why the mainstream conspiracy is that global warming is a hoax instead of people advocating that fossil fuel companies witheld information like big tobacco. That conversation crosses paths with politics naturally.</p>

The movement imposes the views of mostly wealthy, comfortable Americans and Europeans on mostly poor, desperate Africans, Asians and Latin Americans. It violates these people&#39;s most basic human rights, denying them economic opportunities, the chance for better lives, the right to rid their countries of diseases that were vanquished long ago in Europe and the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most rational people are aware that past societies benefitted greatly from the industrial revolution. This does not mean that looking for better ways is bad. However, the claim that stopping environmental damage hinders third world progress is rather silly because the third world wasn&#39;t being helped when there weren&#39;t any regulations either. It&#39;s an extremely semantic argument that doesn&#39;t stand up to practical application. Going FORWARD under universal regulations technically means everyone is on a level playing field...perhaps THAT is what is being avoided.</p>

<p>An ad on one source offering a solution to aging. Also here&#39;s the bit that really got me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The report admits that La Nina and its counterpart, El Nino, are &quot;two great natural Pacific currents whose effects are so huge they resonate round the world.&quot;
Wait a minute.
According to man-made global warming advocates, CO2 emissions are the main driver of climate change and natural weather patterns caused by sun activity and other native contributors play second fiddle.
But here we have UN climate scientists admitting that natural climate change contributors have eclipsed the effect of CO2 emissions for the past 10 years, even as carbon belchers like China and India have increased CO2 output at record levels!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/el-nino-explained-what-weather-phenomenon-whats-tap-2014-1613058">http://www.ibtimes.com/el-nino-explained-what-weather-phenomenon-whats-tap-2014-1613058</a> Here&#39;s how El Nino works. Your source uses this affecting temperatures more rapidly than climate change as the crux of it&#39;s argument. If you can&#39;t understand that, maybe a climate scientist could explain it to you. To put it simply, it&#39;s like saying that climate change isn&#39;t the biggest factor affecting sea levels because the tide raises it quicker. It&#39;s garbage and any informed person would feel ashamed to have been misled by it. </p>

<p>And the other source is phrased as &quot;reports the London Telegraph.&quot;, however it is a broken link leading to their opinion section, so in other words, along with the website offering me eternal life, it sources a fucking blog. This is why no one will ever be convinced by you. Because you&#39;re willing to believe bullshit to arrive at the answer you want to hear. Most people actually use their brain when reading the links you were so thoroughly convinced by and realise that it&#39;s completely worthless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not.  Read my other post above which targets Oreskes paper, which I&#39;ve analyzed very carefully.  97% is a cherry picked number to proportions I could not believe until I broke the paper down. Please read it first.  There is no scientific ignorance or denial from me, believe it or not.</p>

<p>Spoiler:  The truth is, 66.4 % of scientists had no position on AGW.  Oreskes pulled the 97% from the people who reject or endorse (have a position)</p>

<p>Yes, very few reject, but that&#39;s poor science.   In reality, scientists can&#39;t say for sure; they do not have enough information on such a complex, dynamic, ever-changing system .... and the <strong>MAJORITY OF SCIENTISTS AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT</strong>.  Please read Oreskes and you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about if you don&#39;t believe me. (And you shouldn&#39;t unless you read it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not a consensus when you read through the political propaganda. A SUPERB example is the famous Oreskes paper.  Have you bothered readin it and checking out the outrageous cherry picking to come to the &quot;97%&quot; number.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking out my ass.  I&#39;ve an mechanical engineering degree with research background (Computational Fluid Dynamics)  and a medium to high proficiency in math and statistics for an engineer (not a statistican, climate scientist, or mathematician though obviously) </p>

<p>Please try reading that Oreskes paper and post back here.  I at least hope for you to see it how I see it.  I&#39;m not saying without a doubt climate change caused by humans is a farce, fake and bullshit.  I&#39;m saying the the supposed consensus, is in fact propaganda.  And there <em>should</em> be a discussion.  There should be more research done in this area before we go down a long road of technological overhaul, and too soon, where it might have large effects on all types of economies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I replied to your other comment.  But I&#39;ll ask you again.  </p>

<p>Have. You. Read. Oreskes&#39;. Paper. Or.  Not?  (....Or Cook or Carlton or Stenhouse or Anderegg?)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve no clue as to what Wall Street Journal writes about or tries to push, or how much money or time they&#39;ve spent.  I know of and listen to none of it.  Did you really think I make my opinions on such crap?  But just because they are &quot;pushing&quot; something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong.  Yes, it might, but we have to look to the sources and meta-studies to decide.</p>

<p>See, I have read some (<em>obviously</em> not all) of the literature.  Meta studies are critical to read, and I have read as many as possible, especially when my profession is admittedly not that of a climate scientist.  But I&#39;m a pretty sensible engineer and researcher with above average knowledge of math, statistics, and computational science (had a computational fluid dynamics research position at one point in my life)</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of the complexities of weather/atmospheric dynamics, and aware of the potentially garbage results that computer simulations can supposedly enlighten us with.  Are you?  And again, have you read the meta-studies directly?  Or just the vomit seen in the mainstream news and blog-o-sphere?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are doing what conspiracy theorists do</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Slick, using the &quot;conspiracy theorist card&quot;.  I can&#39;t stand when someone lumps all conspiracies and conspiracy theorists together.  You do know there is such a thing as conspiracy RESEARCHER.  Please don&#39;t fall into the trap of labels and false dichotomies.  You just might be missing something, good sir.  And I never even said this was a conspiracy or hoax, mind you !  You again, don&#39;t know my full position and are labelling me.  It may or may not be a conspiracy.  I don&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>But what I do know is that Science has been wrong plenty of times, and even if there was a &quot;consensus,&quot; (a non-scientific term to begin with) it may be wrong too.  Do you think, that I think all of those times scientists wrong were hoaxes?  I hope not.  There are ...</p>

<p>honest and dishonest mistakes, miscalculations, misrepresentations of data and it&#39;s generalizable applications, over-dependence on math and simulation (lack of dependence on observation,) incomplete data, fake data, missing variables and confounders.  </p>

<p>Maybe, <strong>just maybe</strong> <em>some</em> climate scientists are missing one (or more) of the above?</p>
