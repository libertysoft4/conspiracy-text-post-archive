        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I love science and I think it is very fascinating and I have watched a lot of documentaries. But with so much propaganda being thrown around, how can we be sure that the new breakthroughs in science are true? Couldn&#39;t scientists just as easily be paid off as politicians? I sure as heck don&#39;t have a telescope like Hubble so there is no way I can confirm what they are sending back is accurate. Or about climate change, or about anything scientific really. I watched alot about hubble and that one seems legitimate, as I&#39;m sure most science discoveries are. But what about new ones? What&#39;s stopping them from being paid off and lying to us?</p>

<p>I see alot of Bill Nye being tossed around, especially with that new $20,000 bet he did on video. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4bDk-pPgbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4bDk-pPgbs</a>) The video seems fishy to me, I mean who has an entire production set and prints out a giant $10,000 dollar check just to put someone on blast and make a bet? Why so much effort? It doesn&#39;t seem <em>normal</em> to me. Why be so &quot;TV&quot; and &quot;viral&quot; about an issue like that, why not just tweet it? The weather man he was betting had a normal, human, response. It was simply on twitter and he pretty much just said &quot;Hey, I&#39;m putting my kid through college and don&#39;t make 20k bets like actors can&quot;   source: <a href="https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722533523312119808">https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722533523312119808</a></p>

<p>Also in the video it seems like Bill Nye used the weather guys own correct graph, trying to use it against him. Very weird: <a href="https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722736596533977089">https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722736596533977089</a></p>

<p>The way Bill Nye went about this particular &quot;bet&quot; seemed so orchestrated, pre meditated, and was such an unnatural way to call someone out, that it irked me. He is so ingrained in young peoples mind due to acting on a TV show, that young people my age eat up everything he says. The man has a BS in engineering, and now he is telling me about climate change? Are there no other scientists who can tell me this? Why does it have to be always be Bill Nye? Could he be bought off just like politicians and the media? I don&#39;t have the answers but lately Bill Nye, an actor who was ingrained into my generations childhood, is telling me everything I need to know about science. I&#39;d like some other reputable sources to tell me science information. What do you guy&#39;s think?</p>

<p>Edit: Bill Nye&#39;s video was also pretty condescending to the weather man as he belittles him for working out. Why would he even mention that he works out? It is so irrelevant and I believe used to make the weather man look bad.</p>

In her case, luckily, it was with a consumer grade defibrilator for offices which is certainly a wholesome task.  But it left a bad taste in my mouth and eventually I thought her job was bullshit and by proxy she was bullshit.  So I left.  Also, I didn&#39;t really love her so it was bad of me to stay anyway.  I hope she&#39;s found someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um... As a scientist I can say the likes of Bill Nye have precisely zero effect on &quot;steering the direction of science&quot; whatever that means.

    <div class="md"><p>These TV personalities like Neil Tyson and Bill Nye have a huge effect on science. They steer public perception. Millions of students (including me) idolized those figures as role models when young. You don&#39;t think their pursuit of science will be along the same lines as their role models? </p>

<p>For example we have a shit ton of problems on earth. Yet countless amounts of resources and funding and research goes into NASA and the space program. If public perception of space is negative then billions of public money wouldn&#39;t fund it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that you have a very naive understanding about what science really is.
Science isn&#39;t fact, it&#39;s the agreed upon opinion of how things work at our given time.</p>

<p>At some point in history theories regarding gravity, space, time, and being were also considered science until one day when they weren&#39;t. Science isn&#39;t a concrete thing and we have a lot of bad science going around right now. Most science these days is funded by the wrong people, for the wrong reasons, with unrepeatable lab procedures, and incorrect conclusions. Just look at the work vaccine scientists are doing and GMO scientists and weather modification scientists, it&#39;s a lot of bullshit. </p>

<p>To just blindly follow the science of the day is actually very unscientific. </p>

<p>You must! Science is compliated, and you are only a layman! How are you to form an educated opinion, if even the experts are in disagreement? You must trust the scientists, because everything else leads you to religion and superstition. You don&#39;t want to be an evolution-denying, flat-earther creationist like all dumb people, do you? So trust the scientific consensus. Scientists are getting paid a lot of money to do their job, which is a very hard one, because you have to be very intelligent and study many, many years to become an expert and pass all the tests, and they would not tell you with so much conviction that buildings simply self-disintegrate if it weren&#39;t true. </p>

<p>The moment you begin to question your faith in scientists, <del>Satan</del> ignorance has already won! Now repeat: light is a wave. Light is a particle. Velocities add up. The speed of light is absolute. The atmosphere is warming up and an ice age is around the corner. Man went to the moon, and still has no idea how to get through the van Allen belt. There is no aether and all Tesla ever achieved was a useless machine to make funky sparks. Viktor Schauberger never existed and Coral Castle is just a cheap magician&#39;s trick. </p>

<p>And take your vaccines, do you hear me?</p>

<p>The last link, The Lancet is one of the oldest and most prestigious scientific journals in the world. When the editor-in-chief states that up to 50% of research papers are fraudulent, which would include research published in The Lancet, then you know this is a serious problem.</p>

<p>You can safely assume any research that is tied to big money, either to protect current profits or generate new profits, the rate of fraud is significantly higher. I suspect the Fraud rate is much greater than 50%. But even at 50% that means you simply can no longer trust the statements;</p>

<p>&quot;Doctors recommend...&quot; or &quot;Scientist say...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everything is a conspiracy, but of course there is corruption in every sector of human Industry. Here&#39;s the difference:
Many if not most scientists get into it because they&#39;re genuinely fascinated with some anomalous part of the natural world, or want to solve some problem for humanity. Now of course there are some liars and bad apples, but on the whole, most of us in science are fairly moral. Yes we have to sell out for funding, but in comparison to other fields, ethical standards are vastly higher, and conflicts of interest are quite limited. That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s ubiquitous, but just look around at what we have today, and I think you&#39;d agree, the overwhelming majority of scientific innovation actually helps humanity.</p>

<p>This is not the case with politics, and especially with career politicians. Their whole life is dedicated to basically being a sociopath: doing whatever it takes to fund and win elections, and having no real &quot;job&quot; besides that. Look at most of the negative externalities of science and I bet you&#39;ll find that they&#39;re in some way driven by politically-natured events (I.e the defense industry highjacks science for murder when, under presidents like JFK, we were using most of that part of the budget to explore space).</p>

<p>Scientists on TV are not real scientists, people like Nye and tyson are just like politicians, mouthpieces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even more prevalent than directly paying off scientists, which likely does exist to a degree, is the way that peer review and academia works. </p>

<p>In order to continue to hold a research professorship, you must publish, preferably in the prestigious journals in your field. To get published in these journals, your paper must be accepted by those journals&#39; editors. If they don&#39;t like your research or its implications, they can simply reject the paper. </p>

<p>The whole 97% climate consensus is based on published papers. Who&#39;s to say how many papers that disagreed with that consensus were rejected from the journals? It&#39;s a lot easier to buy off a few journals than all the scientists in a field. And once you realize you&#39;re not going to get published or get funding for such research, you&#39;re naturally going to go into something that will pay the bills. </p>

<p>In some sense, the old system of gentlemen scientists, aristocrats who didn&#39;t have to work for a living could pursue science for science&#39;s sake was a much better system than what we have today. </p>
