<p>Edit: Alright so obviously the community didn&#39;t like this question. Which confuses me honestly, because I wasn&#39;t saying Soros is great, I simply don&#39;t know anything about him. So instead of downvoting how about providing examples of why we should hate him. I want to know what he&#39;s done. There&#39;s only been a couple of genuine replies to this thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currency manipulation:  A large part of Soros’ multibillion-dollar fortune has come from manipulating currencies.  During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad accused him of bringing down the nation’s currency through his trading activities, and in Thailand he was called an “economic war criminal.”  Known as “The Man who Broke the Bank of England,” Soros initiated a British financial crisis by dumping 10 billion sterling, forcing the devaluation of the currency and gaining a billion-dollar profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/4Xsh2">The Soros Threat To Democracy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many people, for instance, know that James Hansen, a man billed as a lonely &quot;NASA whistleblower&quot; standing up to the mighty U.S. government, was really funded by Soros&#39; Open Society Institute , which gave him &quot;legal and media advice&quot;?</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, Hansen was packaged for the media by Soros&#39; flagship &quot;philanthropy,&quot; by as much as $720,000, most likely under the OSI&#39;s &quot;politicization of science&quot; program.</p>

<p>That may have meant that Hansen had media flacks help him get on the evening news to push his agenda and lawyers pressuring officials to let him spout his supposedly &quot;censored&quot; spiel for weeks in the name of advancing the global warming agenda.</p>

<p>Hansen even succeeded, with public pressure from his nightly news performances, in forcing NASA to change its media policies to his advantage. Had Hansen&#39;s OSI-funding been known, the public might have viewed the whole production differently. The outcome could have been different.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-edge/332387-soros-putin-russia-threat-migrants/"> George Soros: A psychopath’s psychopath </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On February 11, <a href="http://archive.is/OY6wz">the Guardian ran an article by George Soros</a> which had run a day earlier here entitled <a href="http://archive.is/rzOeF">“Putin is a bigger threat to Europe’s existence than Isis.”</a></p>

<p>After a quick check of my vital signs, I confirmed that I was indeed awake and the article was real and in the Guardian not The Onion. Before I look at the tissue of untruths which make up the substance of Soros’ article, a few general words about psychopaths are in order.</p>

<p>.....</p>

<p>In the Guardian’s article, then, Soros claims “the US and the EU are making a grievous error in thinking that President Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State.”</p>

<p>The assumptions here are based on pure falsehood. My colleague, the diligent and forthright journalist and writer Gearóid Ó Colmáin, laid an axe as sharp as any to the root of the notion that the so-called War on Terror (taken to include Islamic State) serves anything other than the interests of what Ó Colmáin rightly calls a “tiny and particularly tyrannical ruling elite”.</p>

<p>In an interview with RT, Ó Colmáin said, <em>“There is no War on Terror. There is a war which is being waged using terrorist proxy groups and they are being used against nation states who are resisting US and Israeli hegemony. And they are also being used as a means of disciplining the work forces in Europe. In a period of mass unemployment and austerity, you now have terrorist attacks being committed by terrorists funded, armed and trained by Western intelligence agencies. There is no such thing as ISIS. ISIS is a creation of the United States.”</em></p>

No worries man, just wondered how such an old thread got reported and found your comment. The modqueue is a bit busy right now hence the grumpiness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><del>Why not go to the top of the sub and search &quot;george soros&quot; before asking the question.  Not to be a dick, but show some initiative why don&#39;t you?</del> </p>

<p><del>You were downvoted and yelled at because if you spent any time casually browsing you&#39;re bound to find Soros related and you&#39;d instantly know.  In fact, one article is in the 3k range so it should be the first thing you see.  Secondly, you could search.  Third, you could have been paying attention for the last year.  Fourth, it&#39;s kind of a sin not to be watching the Corbettreport on youtube all the time.</del></p>

<p>Never mind.  I read the thread where the OP started yelling at someone for saying they posted a dumb question and called him a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4fmzt5/genuine_question_why_is_george_soros_so_strongly/d2ay6wg">conspiratard with schizophrenia</a>.  That&#39;s how you lose all credibility in this sub.  Anyway, I reported them.  It&#39;s over, op is a shit tourist rulebreaker in my mind.</p>
