<p>List of books on the subject, for more detail (mostly pdf format) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/books1">https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/books1</a></p>

<p>in a nutshell, it all comes down to whom you trust. whether you trust the people who are telling you a particular version of history.</p>

<p>In a war where 60-80 million people died, it seems the western world cares disproportionately about a special few. Since WWII, [there have been more films(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_films)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_films)</a>] made about the Holocaust than any other subject. Not to mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Holocaust_books">books about the Holocaust</a>. Look at this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_memorials_and_museums">list of Holocaust museums</a> - not just in Europe but in North and South America, Africa, Australia, and Asia. </p>

<p>Jean Marie le Pen said: &quot;&quot;If you take a book of a thousand pages on the Second World War, in which 50 million people died, the concentration camps occupy two pages and the gas chambers ten or 15 lines, and that&#39;s what&#39;s called a detail.&quot;</p>

<p>For this, he was fined £25,000</p>

<p>At least a dozen European nations have laws expressly criminalizing Holocaust denial - as opposed to denial of genocide in general. Several more have made holocaust implicitly illegal. </p>

<p>Not a child exists in the western world who has not been taught the Holocaust from his youth. But how many of those children can name the countless other genocides that occurred in the world? </p>

<p>There is somebody there who really really wants everyone in the world to know all about how terrible the holocaust was, and only about the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews - not any other holocaust, and not any other account of history. You just have to figure out who that is, and why they want this.</p>

<p>There is a lot of evidence that contradicts the official story, but they&#39;ve never come out and addressed that evidence or debunked it or refuted it, they merely suppress and silence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not enlightened, but knowing the people I know and reading the things I&#39;ve read, I firmly absolutely believe it happened.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the whole world didn&#39;t believe it was happening when it happened and now, forces continue to fight to push the same false narrative - hell, in Kiev, the Ukrainians were excited for the Nazis to come in with their &quot;efficiency,&quot; had to be better than the Russians, right? Wrong. :( The Germans killed 33,000 people the first two days. Over 100k by the time they&#39;d left.</p>

<p>Never underestimate the ability of stupid, greedy humans to kill on a mass scale. It happened before the 1940s, after the 1940s, and it&#39;s still happening now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really up to going full-on about this right now, but I commented <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2fqu5h/black_hebrews_make_a_khazar_jew_kid_cry/ckbw2lk">this</a> awhile back, including a pretty must-read section from Anatoly Kuznetsov, here&#39;s a snippet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you tell them out loud, to their faces, that they are being deceived and that they are no more than cannon fod­der and tools in the hands of scoundrels, they won&#39;t listen. They will say it is only a malicious slander. And if you produce facts, they just won&#39;t believe you. They will say: &#39;Such things never happened.&#39;</p>

<p>Ask people who have lived a little longer in this world. When the first reports came from Germany about the Nazi death camps, the rest of the world did not believe them. People were much more disposed to believe the fair words of the scoundrels. Many of those who ended their days as smoke from the chimneys of Buchenwald started by believing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People will put their trust in absolutely anybody-in Lenin or in Stalin, in Hitler or in Khrushchev, in Mao Tse-tung or Brezhnev, and in all sorts of Fidel Castros lower down the scale. They excuse the crimes that are committed because of the grandeur of the ultimate aims; they deny the facts and put their faith in the mere good intentions.</p>

<p>All right, go on believing . . .</p>

<p>If civilization is in danger today, if it is fated to decline and perish, it will do so with the enthusiastic assistance of cred­ulous people. They seem to me more dangerous than the most brazen leaders, because everything is done with their co­ operation. Meanwhile their numbers are becoming depress­ingly large, and one can discern in the future such Babi Yars, Oswiecims (Auschwitzes) and universal Hiroshimas as we have not yet dreamed of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right. my apologies.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about Babi Yar, the only direct evidence of that are 100,000. but these corpses were over 20 years old and were Ukrainian Christians killed by the Bolsheviks, before the Germans ever got there</p>

<p>in fact, the official sources themselves admit that the corpses of 1.3million were never found. Their explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mass graves were opened up, the corpses were burned on piles of wood or steel grilles, then the ashes were examined for valuable objects, gold teeth above all, before the bones were ground and the ashes scattered or buried. Then all other traces that could have indicated the places of execution were removed, and the murder scene dug over and planted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasoning here: They didnt find the bodies, so the lack of bodies means that the Germans must have burned them. </p>

<p>Burning 1.3million corpses to ash would have required 2,000 tons of firewood. the resulting ash would have been over 100 tons of ash. Ash remains ash for centuries, even buried. So the 100 tons of ash should still be there in Ukraine. Furthermore, the &quot;grinding&quot; of bones requires heavy, power-driven machinery, of which there was no evidence at the time in eastern or central europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read Babi Yar. It goes into great detail explaining <em>exactly</em> how it was done. And you are very painfully naive about burning flesh, as sick as it makes me to say to even mention that.</p>

<p>Credulous people. My friends&#39; family trees weren&#39;t pruned to the roots by Bolsheviks. You forget this is so close to us that people we know <em>were there.</em></p>

<p>You are a credulous person. You should instead strive to be an inquisitive person. Your obsequiousness to power won&#39;t gain you anything in the end.</p>
