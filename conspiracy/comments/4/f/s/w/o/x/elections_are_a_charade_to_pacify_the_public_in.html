In some African countries close to 70% of population were slaves. We&#39;re talking about 16th century here, slavery was long abolished in Europe by that time.

    <div class="md"><p>if election votes were posted on a spreadsheet, with each voter getting a unique ID # and able to check that their vote was for the right person, the list could be calculated and you could see the winners. </p>

<p>this is unrealistic for 3 reasons</p>

<p>1) the general public is too stupid and/or lazy to even check something like that, let alone handle keeping track of their other ID #. a good example of how stupid and little people care - look at the amount of people using windows10, even on this subreddit. </p>

<p>2) the average person&#39;s vote doesn&#39;t matter, and it shouldn&#39;t for 2 reasons </p>

<p>a) the public has let the system get like this over the last century. nobody cared then, nobody really cares now, nobody will care in the future. every 4/8 years there&#39;s some hubub about &#39;election fraud&#39;, everyone forgets about it a few weeks later. last time i remember the ron paul votes, nobody cared about that shortly after </p>

<p>b) almost all people should have no say in any bigger picture things.  they can&#39;t even process the information that&#39;s relevant to them, let alone researching and knowing about bigger issues that don&#39;t directly involve them. Just because you&#39;re &quot;here&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you should get a say in something you know nothing about, which in reality is 99.99% of voters. </p>

<p>and the final reason why none of this matters, because whoever wins the next election - it won&#39;t matter. whether it&#39;s trump or sanders or hillary, for example, within the next 10-15 years all illegal immigrants will be made into some form of documented resident. </p>

<p>Soon enough, the elites won&#39;t even have to rely on the Soldiers and Policemen to enforce the laws. They will be able to squash any rebellion with the machines. Our only chance to fight will be with the use of hackers that will try to control the machines; however, if they take away the encryption, enforce backdoors on everything, and in the future, prevent any computer (smartphone, desktop, laptop) to be disconnected from the internet (or simply prevent you from using it if there&#39;s no connection), we won&#39;t even have that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most informational part of this clip occurs towards the end when a licensed attorney addresses specific actions taken by the vote counters and audit officials that reveal how such a fraud is perpetrated.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSNTauWPkTc&amp;amp;sns=em#t=01h15m15s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSNTauWPkTc&amp;amp;sns=em#t=01h15m15s</a></p>

<p>Personally, it&#39;s difficult for me to watch this, because I have a lot of problems with how this is all structured. What irks me the most is this guy on the far end of the city board who proclaims to be a &quot;professor of auditing&quot;. That&#39;s wonderful, good for him. I&#39;m not entirely sure what you have to do to become a professor of auditing, but forgive my ignorance if I think properly auditing the results of an election is far from being a complex science. Being a &quot;professor&quot; does not mean that what you say goes in lieu of relevant counterpoints, yet that&#39;s the assertion he implies right before the 38-minute mark. He asks the woman speaking what she&#39;s a doctor of, as if particular fields of medical practitioners are incapable of grasping the concept of a legitimate audit.</p>

<p>Using your credentials to establish superiority in a discussion or as a defensive rebuttal is all too often a cheap and cowardly way to avoid an honest back-and-forth that provides both concerning questions and thoughtful corrective actions. To simply discredit a family physician&#39;s critical remarks on the basis of being a &quot;professor&quot; makes me want to vomit. Perhaps, explaining why everything that occurred during the audit happened like it did would better alleviate the nerves of those in attendance, rather than insisting your process is fine and people shouldn&#39;t worry about it.</p>

<p>This type of hearing is so discouraging to so many champions of change. I can build mathematical models that can give you exact odds a particular candidate has of winning based on exit polling of any sample size, and have the info verified as true. Yet, I get the idea that I couldn&#39;t have a discussion about this with the &quot;professor&quot; because, well...I don&#39;t have a degree? I&#39;m missing a certificate telling people that I&#39;m a sharp guy and know how an audit works?</p>

<p>People should never made to be felt they are not worthy of particular suggestions or concerns because of educational shortcomings, especially in matters of government. Educational accomplishments are based solely on the merit of other people&#39;s approvals, and there are a lot of highly-intelligent people who didn&#39;t bother with that process, and they should be listened to every bit as much as the others. Just my opinion...you can guess which side of that coin I&#39;m on, LOL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <em>sole</em> fact that the reported election results could even be found anywhere in the same building the audit was taking place is in and of itself proof of a flawed process. There&#39;s really no justification for this. Notice how the officials only decide to address the questions they have a real answer for, all the while talking down to the constituents. For example, the guys on the board were very quick to explain the situation with the back-up voting machines and their role in the audit process, but completely ignored the complaints about the method the auditors were using to count the votes, which <em>is a complete travesty</em> and should have been the focus of everybody in that room. Instead, they&#39;re told their 5 minutes are up, drop a note in the suggestions box, and get out of here.</p>

<p>In my honest opinion, a government that holds hearings of this importance in the manner which they do is very worthy of a government that needs to be overthrown.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love it if everyone could share more sources and we could turn this into a more comprehensive post in the future. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last Friday, Republican candidate John Kasich <em>(running in distant third place behind Trump and Cruz)</em> was interviewed by National Public Radio host Robert Siegel, who asked Kasich how, given his trailing position in the polls, he could possibly hope to become the nominee at the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>His answers shed some light on the true nature of US politics, and the way that the Elite see the peon voters:</p>

<p>[Snippets from the interview - <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/15/474411546/ohio-gov-john-kasich-defends-chances-of-winning-gop-nomination">full interview here</a>]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>SIEGEL</strong>: But past Republican conventions have required, you know, wins in five states or eight states to get someone even placed in nomination. Do you need a rule change that says if you&#39;ve won only one state you can be nominated?</p>

<p><strong>KASICH</strong>: <strong>Well, first of all, there are no rules for this convention - none. Each convention sets their own rules.</strong> And I would expect that the rules committee for this convention, in light of how crazy this year has been and in light of the fact that the front-runner cannot win a fall election, <strong>I expect the convention to be open.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Meaning, apparently, that the results of State Primaries and Caucuses will be <strong>ignored</strong>]</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>SIEGEL</strong>: Are you now in the position of saying that if the popular will is to nominate Donald Trump, the party should ignore it?</p>

<p><strong>KASICH</strong>: Well, <strong>what would make you assume it&#39;s the popular will?</strong></p>

<p><strong>SIEGEL</strong>: Well, more people have voted for him than for anybody else in the primary.</p>

<p><strong>KASICH</strong>: <strong>So what?</strong> When you went to high school, you took a test. If you made an 83, even if you did better than anybody else in the class, you didn&#39;t get an A &#39;cause an A is 90. So you go to a convention and you don&#39;t have enough delegates to win the nomination then why would we just give it to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kasich is clearly saying that the Republican Party is fully prepared to toss all of the Primary results into the SHREDDER - ignoring the charade we call the &quot;Primaries&quot;, and that it will be the DELEGATES, (not the people) who ultimately decide on the nominee - and Kasich seems to believe that he has the nomination** in the bag.** </p>

<p>Interestingly, as of today, the Republican delegate count is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Trump: 845</strong></p>

<p>Cruz: 559</p>

<p>Kasich: 148</p>

<p>So much for the illusion of self governance. The only question is, where do <strong><em>We, The People</em></strong> go from here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no expert on Kasich but this doesn&#39;t read to me like the smugness of an elite. If anything I&#39;d guess the true elites view him as just as much of a peon. This reads more like the desperation of a candidate without a ghost of a chance who&#39;s trying to convince himself he still has one.</p>

<p>Political parties in the US are basically private clubs and they can set any rules they wish. They are under no obligation to consider the popular will of the people. They are counterproductive to our political process and should be abandoned in my opinion.</p>

<p>where do We, The People go from here? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reality TV and beer guts, just like we always have.</p>

<p>If nobody cared the popular vote lost the presidency in 2000, nothing else will phase the public. Or hell, go further back. There have been plenty of incidents in he last century that demonstrated a gross abuse of power - prohibition, the drug war, Vietnam, the JFK conspiracy, Watergate, the oil crisis, the propagandized insanity that was the cold war, the isolationism while Nazi&#39;s took over Europe, or the rationing once the war started. The hunger and riots while barons rode high in the great depression. Nothing will change until the TV goes out and the hot wings get too expensive on slave wages, and even then the people will be too powerless to fight an enemy at the scale of the US military and its global alliances bent on maintaining power.</p>

<p>Personally, maybe one of the oligarchs who are not sociopaths (and there are very few of them) takes pity on me and lets me colonize another planet or something, because that is the only reasonable way out, and even then... you are on their spaceship. Even if they are a nice guy, you are still flying on a spaceship crewed by the established power structures, and they will see them maintained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When empires go into decline they become vulnerable to being knocked off by any old determined rabble. Look at the decline of the French empire. The loss of Indo-China at Dien-Bien-Phu was only the start. They went on to loose all of their colonial possessions. The British gave up India to the non violent protest of Ghandi and gave up most of their colonial territories with a few quiet dirty wars such as those faught in Kenya, Aden, Oman, Suez and Malaysia. </p>

<p>Given the piss poor performance of the US forces in Iraq and  Afghanistan i think a moderately well armed insurgency could beat a fiscally crippled federal government. How loyal will the army or marines or navy stay if they&#39;re not being paid.</p>

There will never be secure voting in this failed implementation of a flawed, that ultimately spawned &quot;The Great Experiment&quot; known as The United States. It failed folks. Who can say they are proud of this country with a straight face and not be a total dumb ass. The history books will probably not reflect how we systematically manipulated all of humanity and led us to our own extinction accurately, but not much can be done about that. We can&#39;t live forever. </p>

<p>None of us talking right now will see a right and just world. That is because the entire planet and all the things on it are sick and dying. Pretty sure we fucked it up so bad that it won&#39;t be till after the ELE that finally wipes the slate clean. Take your pick. Chemtrails, HAARP, the poles and axis already in the process of shifting, nuclear weapons, societal collapse with mass starvation. I could go on for hoes. The elite have plan A - Infinity lined up to depopulate the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political parties determine a candidate to put forth on a ballot. It is quite incidental that sometimes, for some states a poll of opinion is performed. Whoever conflates those polls with an actual election should not be chastised too much though. It&#39;s an easy mistake to be made.</p>

<p>The parties will claim that they have rules and there is a definite process to come up with a candidate. Those rules are changing, arbitrary, cryptic and sometimes non-sensical. But nobody cares. It&#39;s just the way things are.</p>

<p>And the main election is just as good. Electoral college and what not. But it doesn&#39;t really matter, in the end we&#39;re given a choice between someone from side A and someone from side 1. And either will come from the ruling class. They both oppose strongly on very minor issues.</p>

No one really knows what is what. You can read and write comments all day every day and still not know for sure. So I tell myself, it is impossible to control a chaotic world. And I try to think positive. I try to think, maybe those who have this much power, might be trying to do some good. I can&#39;t explain it, but I was on this kinda thinking last year and everyone and everything was pleasant and positive. Somehow I lost that thinking. Anyway, just do good, be good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And, herein lies the problem.  I work for a test lab that tests voting machines for The United States Elections Assistance Committee (EAC).  The audit process actually works, when done, correctly...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Turn on machine, get a printed &#39;Zero votes&#39; printout from the machine (this shows that no votes are added/changed, beforehand)</p></li>
<li><p>Open station.  This is when people begin voting.</p></li>
<li><p>Close station, printout results.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, the downside to this process is where it is put into hands of people.  YOU MUST TRUST THE PEOPLE COUNTING, OR ALL OF THIS IS MOOT.  The printouts from &#39;Zero&#39; and &#39;End&#39; are signed and dated by the auditor when they are printed.  Now, you have accurate (to the best of it&#39;s ability) machine totals, a paper trail, AND the actual ballots from the machines.  So, in theory, you have two totals that MUST match, or else there was some issue with the machine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, something as simple as having a little too much static electricity built up can Blue-Screen an ES&amp;S machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With modern tech I&#39;d like to know the hardware architecture with all specs public, and have the source code for the programming openly published along with a public copy of the compiled version and its checksum. Not only that, but save periodic points kept on record of the vote tallys with their own files and checksums. Hopefully this would reveal any code injection or other tampering with the data. Votes entered on the machine indexed and identified by number which is available to each voter in the form of a reciept. This data should also be made available for release after the vote to ensure confidence.</p>

<p>My feeling is that making it open source in some regard makes it more secure in regards to proper auditing. Trusting the software to do the right thing while it does a printout isn&#39;t good enough if you have no idea what&#39;s going on inside the box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just had to comment - I&#39;ve been sick for like a week, and my eyesight still isn&#39;t back to normal. I <em>definitely</em> misread the title as &quot;Electrons are a charade to pacify the public&quot;.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;d be hard pressed to find anyone here who doesn&#39;t take the falsification of elections as a &quot;well, duh&quot; level of given here. I just think you&#39;re equally hard pressed to find more people who regularly frequent this subreddit who think that Sanders is not a political pawn himself. </p>

<h1>Bernieprop - that would actually be a good Subreddit, just for the posting of the Berninite propaganda that his supporters believe is appropriate to spread everywhere, as though the spreading of propaganda for any purpose was a positive thing. Maybe it would make Reddit les susceptible to this in the future?</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d just like to add that despite this sub being full of people who are well aware elections are a charade, that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t post evidence of it. This sub isn&#39;t just about posting new conspiracies to discuss. If anything, this dub should be a database of sources of evidence</p>

<p>No use comparing history to our current situation. We are dealing with a breakaway civilzation with tech many decades ahead of what has been disclosed to the public, access to all communications, a black network of hundreds of thousands of criminals, control of the worlds arms, an army of MK ULTRA slaves...</p>

<p>try fighting that. I&#39;ll stick to my love, connection to the earth and exploration of consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were they a disenfrancised voter class?</p>

<p>If not - and you can&#39;t prove it was based on discrimination - doesn&#39;t seem to be any laws violated (not in e VRA at least).</p>

<p>Just corruption. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t suck, of course. If I went to vote for these shenanigans and played by the Rules and was still told to fuck off I&#39;d be pretty angry.</p>
