    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to start an argument, but here&#39;s another way of looking at it.</p>

<p>What is illegal and what is not? Another interesting question is how is this decision made... and <em>who</em> gets to decide?</p>

<p>A lot of things should be illegal because it just seems self-evident to anyone. If you have some familiarity with natural law, you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m getting at. But there are plenty of things that are illegal where nobody is harming themselves or anyone else.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples where something is illegal in one place, but legal somewhere else. The are also plenty of examples where the legality of something changes over time.</p>

<p>Prohibition of alcohol is one example. Weed currently seems to be another. So what&#39;s up with this anyways? You&#39;d think that, if the law was perfect, it wouldn&#39;t change over time or vary so much from place to place.</p>

<p>Well, in many cases, the law has nothing to to with what&#39;s inherently wrong or right... or good or bad. The law gets decided by a small number of people at the top of the society in which we live. They usually decide what should and shouldn&#39;t be legal based on the needs of society itself. In many instances, this decision is strongly influenced by the needs of the powerful few instead of the average person.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with LSD? I&#39;m going to speculate now. For a long time, LSD has been viewed with suspicion by the elite. They don&#39;t like the way it gives a person the ability to see the world in a completely different way. If you seek to maintain control of society and along comes a bunch of people who can see the world in a completely different way, that would probably make you very uncomfortable. You&#39;d probably prefer it if everyone had a similar perspective to your own. Someone who sees things differently might even have an advantage over you.</p>

<p>LSD is also associated with the social unrest of the 1960&#39;s. Again, not a great thing if you&#39;re one of the law making establishment elite. So, as you rightly asked, why the change now?</p>

<p>I think that someone has realized that LSD <strong>in low doses</strong> can be useful to society. If it can improve someone&#39;s mood, that&#39;s a good thing. If it can enhance creativity and imagination, that&#39;s also a good thing. Especially if these improvements can be harnessed at the workplace.</p>

<p>Remember what I said earlier about how the legality of a thing is closely tied to the benefit/s to society by that thing? Same principle applies here.</p>

<p>If LSD, in certain circumstances, can be positively shown to improve worker productivity, it <strong>WILL</strong> become legal. They aren&#39;t making it legal for our benefit. They&#39;re doing it for theirs.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly cynical way of seeing things, but I believe that it is correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL </p>

<p>You have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>LSD tolerance is so severe that if you take it two days in a row, the effects will be incredibly diminished. Take it a third day and it won&#39;t effect you at all! It&#39;s pretty much non-abusable! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll pretty much be restricted to a weekly event at most lol</p>

<p>Well I guess you could take like 500 tabs and melt your brain but that&#39;s about as easy as drinking yourself to death with water (Like that lady trying to win the wii). It&#39;s pretty difficult. Unless you had a pre existing mental condition, then the affects could be escalated. <sup>citation</sup> <sup>needed</sup></p>

<p>The biggest danger of LSD is the unregulated market (because it&#39;s fuckin illegal) where other research chemicals pop up to replace LSD since its fairly hard to make. The RCs is the shit that&#39;s destroying people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LSD is more of a tool to break addiction.</p>

<p>In addition, due to the rapid tolerance, it is one of the few things that your body kinda prevents you from developing an addictive pattern to, on a neurological level.  That is not to say it cannot be done: the human mind is a strange place and I&#39;m sure some folks can manage to develop an addiction, but this would be an extreme rarity if possible at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure it was quite that simple.  He personally experienced LSD to result in a cessation of his craving for alcohol.  This led to considerable personal conflict within himself and between him and the organization he founded.  Use a drug to treat a drug?  Yeah that didn&#39;t go over very well.  But he does say that LSD might well be an appropriate treatment for those who do not find help in the 12-step program.</p>

<p>LSD has no LD50. That instantly makes it safer than a huge amount of pharmaceuticals that are supposedly safe and prescribed daily.</p>

<p>The biggest danger about LSD in my eyes is that it&#39;s illegal. This pushes production underground and potentially creates poor quality product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar stories have been coming out about psilocybin (shrooms). This is a good thing. Speaking from experience, in small, irregular doses and in a healthy environment, they&#39;re both infinitely better for the psyche than anti-depressants, alcohol, weed, or whatever other chemical escapism. LSD&#39;s main downsides are that you shouldn&#39;t take it alone somewhere where you might get lost and you can&#39;t really function socially while feeling the effects.</p>

<p>This is a good thing, I think. If there&#39;s a potential real conspiracy here, it&#39;s that they&#39;re talking up LSD to eventually sell something that will be <em>branded</em> as LSD, but actually be something genuinely harmful/addictive/useful for brainwashing.</p>

<p>LOL. LSD and psilocybin <strong>are</strong> &quot;chemical escapism.&quot;</p>

<p>Just because it makes you feel pleasure doesn&#39;t mean they did anything for your &quot;psyche.&quot;</p>

<p>The main thing the drugs did is make you want to push drugs to other people.</p>

<p>Wait, which is it?</p>

<p>We must do research on it, but you already &quot;know&quot; that there are no serious, long term side effects, because, um, you took acid a bunch and you are <strong>totally</strong> normal, right?</p>

<p>Other than the fact you have become an LSD evangelist yourself, despite you having ZERO scientific understanding of it and can point to ZERO major studies?</p>

<p>So much for &quot;knowing thyself.&quot;</p>

<p>NO DRUGS are free of side effects. </p>

<p>Yet the LSD cultists sound like just that - CULTISTS - who assume that <strong>their</strong> drug leads to some magical &quot;enlightenment.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t saying that hallucinogens aren&#39;t chemical escapism. They are. They just typically aren&#39;t as harmful, and are potentially more beneficial, than most other forms of it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong; If you get a regular supply of a hallucinogen and abuse it, or take it for the wrong reasons in the wrong way, it will do damage. It can ruin your life. If you eat a couple of handfuls of shrooms alone, deep in the woods, you&#39;ve got a decent chance of dying. If you&#39;re on LSD more often than not, you&#39;re basically gonna turn into Ozzy Osbourne - incoherently rambling, drifting between reality and the imaginary world in your mind. Like with literally all things, moderation is key.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve felt happier, fuller, more satisfied in my skin since my first dose of LSD. It wasn&#39;t a pleasant experience - in fact, it was <strong>really fucking scary</strong>. But, by the end of it, I&#39;d come to terms with the fear I was feeling, and by the time I was sober, I felt a much deeper understanding of myself, the things that scare me, the thoughts that comfort me, the places my mind wanders to when I feel like I&#39;m in a dark place. It&#39;s been genuinely useful to me, not just with respect to how I see myself, but how I approach social situations and new experiences. I used to be introverted and judgemental. It took a temporary break from my close-minded reality to see the roots in social anxiety and fear of my own inadequacy that were hiding behind that. No amount of therapy could&#39;ve convinced me of it; A tiny does of LSD did it in a few hours, for a hell of a lot cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER FOLKS!!!</strong> If you&#39;re taking hallucinogens, <em>have a chaperone</em>. That is all.</p>

<p>What, like, literal, court-admissible proof? No. I do have personal experience with alcoholism, greening out and badly prescribed anti-depressants. Hallucinogens helped me overcome those issues/their after-effects, actually. It&#39;s not like dropping some acid cured me or anything, but it certainly didn&#39;t hurt.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;ve never tried these substances. Faith healing is a placebo. LSD <em>definitely</em> isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel the same need to impose on others as you seem to. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to just anyone. Most people don&#39;t really &quot;need&quot; it, and would probably be better off <em>not</em> doing it, kinda like how <em>everyone</em> would be better off avoiding hard liquor. It&#39;s all about what you make of the experience.</p>

<p>Not a fan of Scientology at all, but... Who are you to judge where people find their fulfilment? Hell, you seem to be missing something, if you&#39;re crusading against something you know nothing about over the Internet the way you are. Besides, Mr. Hubbard did better for himself than either of us has, I&#39;m willing to bet. Kinda shoots down your argument, doesn&#39;t it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a scene in Jodorowsky&#39;s &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; that touches on this. IIRC, the part when the pilgrims reach the &quot;base&quot; of the Holy Mountain, and they see one guy promising God and the universe in the pills he&#39;s hawking.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a little backlash. Understandable, since this whole idea that it is somehow wrong to explore your own consciousness is pretty unethical.  So when people such as yourself start coming across against LSD, frankly you sound like just another misinformed, ignorant, agenda-driven D.A.R.E. officer.</p>

<p>Uh, if you read the articles, the authors have pretty clearly all experienced hallucinogenic drugs.  I&#39;ll start considering the implications of a conspiracy when the government starts rumbling about legalizing hallucinogenic drugs.</p>

<p>We&#39;re a long, <em>long</em> way from that.  So long as the official stance is that LSD is a schedule I controlled substance, I&#39;m sorry but there are no &quot;implications&quot; to consider.  The end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It happens with weed too....people with family history of schizophrenia can speed up the on-set by smoking a buncha pot....meaning, maybe they wouldn&#39;t have a psychotic break until they&#39;re 30, but if they smoke a buncha pot they can have one when they&#39;re 18. Does that mean pot is bad? No. Does pot give people mental disorders? No. </p>

<p>Same thing with LSD man. Everyone&#39;s different. I think you&#39;ll find plenty of people here who have done LSD with no issue, and you&#39;ll probably find even more people that said LSD helped them in some profound way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well lsd and other powerful psychedelics were a large part in mind control techniques. psychedelics helped in the 60&#39;s to accelerate the breakdown and trust of traditional institutions, not that that&#39;s all bad, but it&#39;s definitely not all good, and more so not the purview of <em>government</em> and is competely unethical as it was a clandestine operation/&quot;study&quot;.  furthermore, just like the original &quot;ecstacy&quot; MDMA morphed into &quot;e&quot; and &quot;molly&quot; which are completely different and far more dangerous chemicals like bathsalts and meth, you have no idea what the sob&#39;s are actually mass distributing and setting you up for.</p>

<p>as an aside, SWIM had tried lsd and mushrooms in the past and had some entertaining experiences to say the least, and some intense and illuminating experiences.  just be educated and aware of what you put into your body in any case, drugs, nutrition and otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a &quot;by-the-by&quot; ... Ted Kaczynski went through some very interesting experiments where LSD <em>may</em> have been used.  If you read up on what happened to him, it is pretty clear that the real problem here is the vicious and unethical psychological experimentation that was conducted on him.  However, there is a possibility that if you combine that kind of brutality with LSD, you might perhaps sometimes get a unabomber.</p>

<p>Since the US government and it&#39;s intelligence and military arms function on this institutionalized brutality, LSD probably is a dangerous drug <em>to them</em>.  It wakes people up to the reality of the nightmare, and their life&#39;s purpose becomes a quest to end the horror.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s maybe that.  I can&#39;t find confirmation that he was given LSD, but there are some very interesting articles if you google &quot;ted kaczynski lsd.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>I would like to emphasize very strongly here that LSD is not the problem.  Only when combined with direct Western military or psychoanalytic brainwashing, and only because those methodologies are horrific nightmares that should never exist.</strong></p>

<p>LSD was first banned in California because parents were FURIOUS that the universities, in partnership with the CIA, were using their children as guinea pigs in their drug testing experiments.</p>

<p>Okay, seriously, last time I&#39;m answering you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already acknowledged that it can be abused to great detriment, and I wouldn&#39;t put it past the CIA to provide something, anything, that will distract and/or incapacitate a group they are targeting. In fact, providing it in excess to a group of mostly students has huge potential to turn a lot of them into the Ozzy-like zombies I described. Of course, you could also just give them painkillers, or SSRIs, or quaaludes, or weed, or night-time cough syrup. There&#39;s a reason the CIA switched to heroin and cocaine - they&#39;re far more effective at disabling the &quot;target market&quot; than LSD ever could&#39;ve been.</p>

<p>LSD is not inherently awesome. It&#39;s just a chemical. It has downsides. There is grave danger in using it irresponsibly. That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s uses, or that it brainwashes everyone who uses it into being a walking advertisement for it. It just means you should be careful with it.</p>

<p>You sound like a child because the entirety of your comments here have been trolling, not because of your opinions regarding hallucinogens. Your opinions are clearly founded in a mix of fiction and delusion, but that&#39;s to be expected across all ranges of ages. Your lack of maturity in discussing this, however, is reminiscent of a bratty preteen who actually listened for a moment (just a moment) in health class.</p>

<p>I feel pretty good about where I stand. I can laugh at you, not because we have some disagreement, or because I&#39;m making assumptions about you that give me some illusion of being somehow better than you for the different choices I&#39;ve made, but because I spoke my mind clearly and honestly using what I know, whereas you just blathered and snorted and called everyone who doesn&#39;t totally agree with you a stoner.</p>

<p>Seriously, as a friend (we&#39;ve gone back and forth enough that I feel like I can call you that with only a bit of sarcasm), you should try it in a safe, controlled situation, accompanied by a sober person you trust. I don&#39;t usually recommend it, but something tells me you could use it. You&#39;re a bit quick to judge others for things you don&#39;t understand. Maybe you should confront the parts of yourself that you don&#39;t understand. Maybe you don&#39;t even need hallucinogens to achieve that, which would be even better, but you definitely need <em>something</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL - &quot;RazingAll&quot; is desperately trying to spin his ignorance.</p>

<p>He thinks because he took a bunch of LSD he knows something about something. Does he even understand that LOTS of people have taken LSD - along with many other drugs - and that the fact he took LSD really doesn&#39;t mean much?</p>

<p>I mean, lots of people have taken drugs. But most people don&#39;t hold themselves out as somehow &quot;enlightened&quot; because they scored some drugs in some jam band&#39;s parking lot.</p>

<p><strong>YAWN</strong></p>

<p>Since you can&#39;t read books, therefore, NO ONE can read books, eh?</p>

<p>Maybe you could have spent less time tripping on LSD, and more time reading books?</p>

<p>Nah. No one can spend TWENTY WHOLE YEARS reading books! That&#39;s crazy!</p>

I became extremely lazy, apathetic, couldn&#39;t put together sentences when u was high, weak willed if I were smoking say a week straight with(food, nicotine,caffeine, porn etc), literal body aches when high and just didn&#39;t give a fuck about the world while on it.

My regular account could potentially be linked to me personally.  In real life, I have a fair amount &#39;on the line&#39; and when you speak about things like this, there are all sorts of people that want to dig around and &quot;dox&quot; you, not just government but people such as yourself digging through my comment history.</p>
