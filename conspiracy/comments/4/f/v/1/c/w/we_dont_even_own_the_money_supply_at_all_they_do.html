        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Good Luck, because you are going to see how bad you have been had by the International Oligarchs, and no it won’t be a result of the False Flag they will try to blame it on, it will be a result of the 100 year old setup where they have been illegally printing/creating the money supply since 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was signed by Woodrow Wilson, and transferring all the true wealth to themselves, and leaving you with nothing.</p>

<p>They are the International Oligarchs, who happen to be Jews loyal to Israel, and own all the central banks in the world including the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank Of International Settlements.</p>

<p>Say you have $20 bill in your pocket, guess what, all the money in the money supply comes from borrowing it from the Federal Reserve Bank and it all has to be paid back to the Federal Reserve Bank with interest, someone somewhere had borrowed the money where that $20 bill in your pocket came from and it has to be paid back to the Federal Reserve Bank, therefore, the entire money supply is actually owned by the Federal Reserve Bank, and they get it all paid back with interest. They printed/created it and it all gets paid back to them, so they are just printing money for themselves.</p>

<p>Why are Americans/Europeans/Russians letting this small group of people literally take all the wealth? </p>

<p>Remember, the International Oligarchs print/create paper money, it is just paper, but you sell your precious time for this paper and you sell your land for this paper, however, time has actual value, land has actual value, this paper money has no value, that it does is only an illusion, and when this paper gets paid back to the few owners of the Federal Reserve Bank, they use it to buy things of real value, like land, resources, and gold, because they know it is only paper without any real value, and this is how all the things of real wealth value are being sucked away from everyone and the country by the extremely few people that privately own the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>Lets say that the government had borrowed that money where that $20 bill in your pocket came from, it is important to understand that we have to pay an income tax to pay back all the money the government borrows from the Federal Reserve Bank to the Federal Reserve Bank, and if the government can’t pay it from taxing us, the Federal Reserve Bank will take all the Federal Lands and Resources owned by the United States as collateral. This set up is complete slavery and we have to end it now. </p>

<p>It is totally unconstitutional because Congress is mandated by the Constitution to print/create the money. We have to take the power to print/create the money back to the Congress, so that the government can lend it and use the interest to pay for infrastructure and social security, of course this would be completely debt free because the money supply would be printed/created by the government and therefore the people completely without debt, because it would not be borrowed money. </p>

<p>We’re sort of averse to slaughtering people, even if it needs to be done. Never mind that many of our own are complicit. Pathological altruism, you see.</p>

<p>It’s currency, not money. Money is a store of value.</p>
