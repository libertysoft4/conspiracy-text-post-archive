<p>instead we are focusing on her assange e-mail leaks.</p>

<p>the thread about the 4chan FBI high level analyst Q&amp;A is silent.</p>

<p>well done. seems you still have a grip about the situation. ROFLOL.</p>

<p>EDIT: and BTW. clintons arent big. they are small, only worth $150 million combined. there are way bigger fishes in the pond still.</p>

<p>there are many still who are eager to sell their souls, waiting in line to replace the clintons.......... and the bushes too.</p>

That&#39;s what he said he&#39;d do if he were elected. I want someone in the oval office with that mindset. Hillary is the opposite of that mindset. Everything aside from this is meaningless to me.</p>

<p>There&#39;s your discussion. I&#39;m betting you won&#39;t have much of a response to it as it&#39;s pretty much not debatable. I&#39;m expecting you to not only ignore this but downvote it for obvious reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what is it that trump is actually saying? He hasn&#39;t been involved in politics, hasn&#39;t really cared what people in power have done. He has focused on himself and his money, not public service.</p>

<p>The president doesn&#39;t have a lot of power. Congress makes the rules. Trump is already talking about surrounding himself with other rich business folks. He has shown he has problems running a business and people want him to run the government?</p>

<p>No public service. Iffy businesses/bankruptcy. Bad mouths everyone. Doesn&#39;t understand foreign policy. Wants the government run like a company of his. </p>

<p>Our country isn&#39;t perfect, but it has a lot of great things going on with it. We need changes - some big ones to justice. The poor get screwed on a regular basis. The rich get away with most everything. Corporations break laws and pay a small fine.</p>

<p>If there is one issue you are big on, focus on that. BLM for example has issues they address (police/justice), some folks focus on abortion rights, others on gun rights. </p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t know how to run a government. He can&#39;t even run a coherent campaign. He can&#39;t fix the problems we have but he sure can create a heckuva lot more by screwing up things to make it all even worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM is a soros funded operation intended to cause a further divide amongst the populace.</p>

<p>You say he can&#39;t run a coherent campaign... compared to Hillary&#39;s his platform is crystal clear. You say he can&#39;t fix the problems... Hillary had a huge hand in causing those problems.</p>

<p>You say no public service as if it&#39;s a condemnation. It&#39;s his saving grace. He doesn&#39;t have a track record of fucking the public over... Hillary has a new thread about someone trying to prosecute her being murdered every other day.</p>

<p>You say Trump doesn&#39;t understand foreign policy. Probably because of the weak but repeated ad nauseam no muslim thing. What you don&#39;t realize is that they&#39;re saying the sketchy alleged CIA sponsored radical group in Syria (who I assume is there to eventually orchestrate a false flag operation to start the eventual war in Syria with our consent) has access to a machine that prints passports. (wonder how they could&#39;ve gotten that...). Meanwhile our foreign policy doesn&#39;t seem to be going so well as it is seeing as how the world hates us, might as well let them and take our ball with us. Its about time to do ourselves a solid for once. Why is it our responsibility to foster nations? Why are we an asshole when we decide enough is enough and let them loose to fend for themselves for awhile? Fuck us for telling them to nut up, right? What role does the secretary of defense play in the overall perception of a nation?</p>

<p>Or is it his stance on moving jobs back home? Are we really that much of an asshole if we finally start supporting ourselves again by actually producing goods instead of trying to play the middle-man game of musical chairs, of which the song stopped playing for the fortunate ones long ago? They all talk about depopulation as if we couldnt possibly  supply adequate food and shelter for this many people when in reality if it weren&#39;t for NAFTA we might not have entire cities known for a particular product or resource going bankrupt. We might not have people going around accepting the massive negative affect it had and continues to have on their lives as an inevitable part of life because they don&#39;t remember or weren&#39;t around for the time before the husband of Trump&#39;s opponent in this election decided to sell us out for a bribe and corporate profits 20 years ago. I think it was around the time they burned that &#39;cult&#39; alive in Waco, Texas. </p>

<p>What can I tell you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am amazed that anyone would think this sub is pro-Hillary, but since about 50 people have upvoted you, some here must obviously share this view (even assuming many of those votes are from people will upvote literally anything that is critical of the mods).</p>

<p>I know, perhaps you could link a pro-Hillary comment by any mod just to prove your point? Just one will do. Failing that, you could try to find a single pro-Hillary post (by anybody) on this subreddit, with a score higher than zero. Surely the &quot;pro-Hillary&quot; mods would have managed to engineer that? </p>

<p>I think you will struggle.</p>

<p>What you need to understand that this sub is anti-[the political system]. Hillary has no supporters at all in this sub, but that doesn&#39;t mean this sub is a platform for activists from either <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> or <a href="/r/SandersforPresident">/r/SandersforPresident</a>, because this sub has been critical of both of them too, and many here are suspicious about their personal motives. Sadly, Sanders has already proved the doubters right by folding like a pack of cards and endorsing Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t wait for the elections to be over so this sub can get back to normal operation. All these anti-clinton/trump submissions are really starting to take over actual information. There&#39;s no real content in 90% of the submissions and none of these folks really want a discussion. Both sides are just trying to shove a message down our throats.</p>

<p>If you point out the hypocrisy you are immediately labeled as a shill by whichever side.</p>

<p>That being said, there&#39;s substantially more &quot;Trump supporters&quot; pushing content here than Clinton supporters. I&#39;ve seen a few profiles that could have been CTR at work but you would have to be completely blind to think that Trump hasn&#39;t also recruited their own internet army.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you are very uninformed.  Look up what Stephen Cohen of Princeton says about Hillary in that she has brought us closer to nuclear war with Russia than ever before.  Trump says nuclear war is our greatest threat, and will avoid nuclear war with Russia, he is making moves to work together with Russia.  You have ruined this forum with your never trump attitude.
