        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How can we make it happen? Mainstream media is easily the downfall of America. How can we promote a global boycott of the mainstream. I mean even if it is just CNN and FOX. If their ratings drop down to next to nothing what will they do? I know I havent watched television let alone MSM for decades. We truly need to wake folks up to the lies and encourage people to turn off their televisions. It is basically the driving force of corruption. Propaganda has always been a powerful tool but it has been taken to another level this election cycle. It NEEDS to be stopped. I dont see any other way of anything changing if people are constantly being fed bullshit information that is in line with our oppressors agenda.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Does anyone agree this is the #1 problem in America today? How can we change this? BRAINSTORM! No idea is a stupid idea. Lets hear it folks. </p>

<p>Suggestions:</p>

<h1>1: More legit MSM debunking sites/shows (ty <a href="/u/rockran">/u/rockran</a>)</h1>

<h1>2: Dont boycott MSM, Boycott their advertisers  (ty <a href="/u/coolshifts">/u/coolshifts</a>) [this may very well be the ultimate answer]</h1>

<h1>3: Write letters to advertisers! Great idea! (ty <a href="/u/gnrl2">/u/gnrl2</a>)</h1>

<h1>4: Convince politicians to Regulate the FCC and News Corporations (ty <a href="/u/OmgKidGetAJob">/u/OmgKidGetAJob</a>)</h1>

<h1>5: Convince friends and family to cancel cable subscriptions and inform the provider your reason for the cancellation  (ty <a href="/u/PRO_NWOdontkillmebro">/u/PRO_NWOdontkillmebro</a>)</h1>

<p>This is something well worth mentioning that I did not know about! Thanks a ton <a href="/u/ryanpeverly">/u/ryanpeverly</a> !!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2013 version of the NDAA repealed a law from 1948 that outlawed government propaganda directed at the American public. So for the last three years, government-disseminated propaganda has been legal. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">News story here:</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question for everyone:</p>

<p>How can we most effectively start a campaign to get people to cancel their cable subscriptions?</p>

<p>How would fake viewer numbers manufacture consent? You need viewers to manufacture consent no? Like if nobody is watching, who is consenting? Who&#39;s views are being manufactured? I thought that was what manufactured consent was all about. Changing peoples views through MSM propaganda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely dont have all the answers but as my OP stated, it starts with you and me. I am doing my part. I am trying to get others around me to do their part. That is why im posting this, trying to encourage others to not only boycott but press for their friends and family to also boycott. We need to remember MSM operates for profit and if there is no profit through advertising they will be forced to change. Or maybe the elite will 100% subsidize? idk. But we need to start somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake viewer number are not meaningless. They do not care if anyone actually watches, only that they can show to advertisers that viewership is at high enough levels to sell ads. I hear you saying people watching and viewership are the same thing. They are not in the eyes of selling ads. Viewership numbers can be fudged. Have you wondered why certain networks allow there conte t to be seen online for free? The pushes their numbers up. For example CNN auto plays a video when you click on any article and will then to play videos after that. That is one method. The other side to that is advertisers really don&#39;t care. They have a budget and need to spend it. I have seen it personally and it amazing that they will literally throw money away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the younger tech savvy crowd i agree. The people we need to reach are the older folks (40+) And the neanderthals (dumb cunts). I can only speak for myself, I have awoken many many people over the past few months. Two just recently as i spent the weekend with a few long time friends that had no idea what was going on in the world. I effectively convinced them to cancel their cable subscriptions and only watch what they want to watch and not what they are told to watch, which to me is what television and radio is all about, Force feeding people information. </p>

<p>&quot;The thing that had happened in Spain was, in fact, not merely a civil war, but the beginning of a revolution. It is this fact that the anti-Fascist press outside of Spain has made it its special business to obscure.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not complicated. Stop calling it MSM and start calling it what it actually is: ratings-based infotainment product. They are not news channels. Also note that the conservative versions always win the ratings wars because they appeal to the lowest common denominator. The Bell Curve tells us that ignorance is the norm; this is who watches this dreck. They are not smart enough to understand your appeals to reason. Meanwhile, neocons complain about bias because they don&#39;t understand the difference between being fair and being balanced. Fair is good; balance is bad. Tbeir ideas are not promoted in a balanced fashion because they are just fucking bad ideas, most of which have been proven failures over the last 40 years (I can&#39;t think of one single thing that they were right about, and I used to vote for them).
  On the up side, Rush Limbaugh has driven his employers into bankruptcy while claiming to be worth every penny of his ridiculously expensive contract. This was done by boycotting advertisers. Perhaps that&#39;s the way to go, since Neilson boxes will continue to bedazzle morons.</p>

<p>I would suggest forming reading and discussion groups addressing this issue. Maybe discuss the videos/links above along with other issues. Or simply turn off your t.v. and engage in more meaningful activities and invite others to join you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA0g5ac4tFM">The Situationists</a>, as described in the video link, were proponents of the <em>derive</em> which was a spontaneous wandering off to counter routinized behavior (part of their <em>psycho geographical</em> study), <em>detournement</em> which was a comical embellishment of MSM and political images and messages. These could be useful starting points.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so, here&#39;s the thing: The 2013 version of the NDAA repealed a law from 1948 that outlawed government propaganda directed at the American public. So for the last three years, government-disseminated propaganda has been legal. News story here: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5</a></p>

<p>That said, we should assume this propaganda is being disseminated all over MSM, as well as on social networks, including this one. </p>

<p>More legit debunking sites is great, but you have to convince a mainstream audience that what you&#39;re saying is true. That&#39;s not easy.</p>

<p>Politicians regulating it wouldn&#39;t happen; it&#39;d just get vetoed. Writing sponsors won&#39;t work; they don&#39;t care what you think and they&#39;re probably in on it. </p>

<p>Boycotting sponsors is a good idea, because they all produce shit that&#39;s not good for you to begin with, so stop spending your money on it.</p>

<p>The only way to combat this is to just turn off your TV. Cancel your cable plan. Stop logging on to their websites. If ratings and web traffic go down, no one is seeing this propaganda. Hell, I&#39;d say cancel your internet plan too, but it&#39;s too powerful a tool to give up at this point; we need it.</p>

<p>I guess my point is: vote with your lifestyle. As long as we live in a system fueled by greed and money, choose to spend what you have on clean water and foods and household products that are sourced and produced sustainably. Get healthy physically and mentally that way you&#39;re not dependent on any &quot;medicines&quot;. Educate yourselves on the system; read up on Austrian economics and fiat currency. Invest in precious metals and maybe some cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Take whatever money you can and invest it in yourself. This society is built to take power away from the individual, so take your own spending power back. MSM is just a cog in the machine.</p>

<p>MSM is ruining my familial relationships. Anything we can do to stop it is ace.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll note, however, that canceling cable won&#39;t do it. Family that consumes only Internet and radio is just as misinformed/fearful/hateful as family that watches MSNBC or FoxNews all day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to understand, many people who participate in this sub, are exceptions to a rule. Look at our numbers compared to r/politics or r/aww. Granted, they have been recently overtaken by shills and fake accounts but our numbers have never been comparable. Read some of the posts on this sub of people who are &quot;snapping out of it&quot;. It takes a hell of a lot to make that happen. Making it happen is the first step we need to take. If not, any move we try to make will fail.</p>
