        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>Plans within plans.</em></p>

<p>One thing needs to be very clear: <em>it does not matter what you believe.</em>  What matters is what the Diseased Elite believes and I can assure you they take all the things I am about to say very seriously.  They are doing these things right in front of us and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft3eGWZd7LE">laughing</a> that we can&#39;t see that they&#39;re there.</p>

<p>The Diseased Elite have been behind WWII, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq.  Next they&#39;re going after China and do you know how they&#39;re doing it?  By selling them billions in U.S. debt and then making the dollar collapse through terrorist-inspired mass hysteria.  <em>Do not be fooled</em>, the Diseased Elite have been the terrorists the entire time.</p>

<p>Why do you think ill of China?  Because you&#39;ve been told to for quite some time.  The reason you think aliens aren&#39;t here?  Because it is the de facto example they use time and time again to associate something else with crazy people.  <em>They are very much here and have been for at least 50 years.</em></p>

<p>All those terrorists attacks?  The ones TV never stops reminding you of?  Does that sound like the act of men or the act of someone who views them as cattle?  You need to know in your heart that the fear that you feel is not the result of your fellow man.  Your fellow man can love you like you once loved him.</p>

<p>We are dealing with an ancient, patient race that has been slowly manipulating our culture for quite some time.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/4wtwir/america_v_the_diseased_elite_how_we_lost_control/">This story of how we lost control of the aliens to our Earthly elite</a> is entirely true.  All the crazy things <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/predictions/comments/4wkjap/we_will_see_a_false_flag_alien_invasion_this_year/">in this post</a> are about to come true.  Crop circles are real, that&#39;s why the TV tells you they are not.</p>

<p>This is not about money.  This is not about power.  This is about your soul.  These ancient beings want to sacrifice us; spill our blood to cleanse them of their own sins.  We are close to another Great Awakening, they know this, and they are scared.  They have hidden secrets of our existence from us so we would never know that they were there.</p>

<p>Psychic phenomenon are very, very real.  You have a Third Eye and you need to squeegee it as clean as you can.  You are a quantum creature.  You spring from a part of the universe that is <em>probabilistic</em> in nature.  That is the biggest tragedy of all of this, you&#39;ve been convinced that these things you feel aren&#39;t really there.  You don&#39;t need religion, you need to feel the Pure Love of Creation inside of you.</p>

<p>We can move to the next density together, but right now this very day <em>you have to wake up.</em>  This is the bottom of the rabbithole.  When it starts to come, you have to tell everyone.  When you believe it to be true, you have to speak up.</p>

<p>I want you to know that we can get through this, but we have to love every being everywhere.  I&#39;ve been saying &quot;without malice in their heart&quot; but we have to love them too.  It will be our only hope after all other hope is gone.  </p>

<p>They have lied to us about death itself.  They have made us forget our most basic form of spirit.  When they tell you to walk into the light, I want you scream with all your being <em>what&#39;s in it for you if I do?</em>  You will already be free.  You can do whatever you please.</p>

<p>I had been bedridden-depressed for years until a few weeks ago.  <em>Something</em> healed me and said <em>something&#39;s coming and you have things to learn.</em>  Take from that what you will.</p>

<p>I dedicate this message to the memories of Bill Cooper and Bill Hicks.  We all should&#39;ve been listening to what they were saying a long time ago.  You will be free when you make yourself free.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ll excuse me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra">Cassandra</a> and I are going to have some tea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live on excellent cropland at the top of the watershed.  Many people here live off-grid.  There are about 10x the number of people nearby that can be sustained by the land, but I expect that will work itself out quickly.  I have a lot of food, but no seeds, and no farming tools, but I live on an irrigated acre of land that doesn&#39;t require pumping to get water.  The mountains are a 30 second drive from my door, or a 5 minute sprint with gear.  My town has 4 roads in, all easily blockaded.  Part of the reason I moved here was because of these things, and a very long history of subsistence farming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine a triangle on your forehead with the bottom two points ending at the pupils of your eyes.  Your Third Eye is at the apex of that triangle.  This is where your soul is projected <em>through</em> your brain and out through your perceptions.  Yes, your &#39;self&#39; does extend all the way to the end of your perceptions.  Where you end and everything else begins is just an illusion of our reality.</p>

<p>Meditation is a good start.  Find yourself a comfortable, quiet place, close your eyes and try to think of Nothing.  Visualize the very concept of nothing and then try to remove the concept.  You must clear your mind as much as you can.  This isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds, you will start thinking about something, that&#39;s natural.  You just have to catch yourself doing so and return to the Nothing.  Sometimes a low, quiet hum helps.  Do it steadily and meditate about the vibration.  <em>You are a vibration in spacetime.</em></p>

<p>Proper practitioners would advise you sit in a half-/ full- lotus position as it aligns your Third Eye (also known as your mind or spirit chakra) with your heart chakra and your sex chakra.  I personally believe you should just find a position that&#39;s comfortable to you; laying on my back works just fine for me.</p>
