        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Theory: Trump is actually a Clinton plant that tries to direct attention away from the corrupt establishment and Hillary&#39;s terrible polling numbers every time they seem to plummet. He is getting paid by the Clinton&#39;s currently to sacrifice the Republican Party. Additionally, they&#39;re providing him a large severance package, and they are promising him inside information to specific industries (so he can know first to invest and profit before anyone else) as long as he destroys his campaign. The establishment GOP is getting promised by the Clinton&#39;s that they will be sure to go to war with Russia if they comply and help to &quot;destroy&quot; Trump. They are currently making deals on legislation that are bipartisan behind closed doors, but are usually &quot;partisan&quot; issues in public (i.e. bank deregulation, fracking, healthcare, welfare, war). Trump is making a scene right now because the media is trying to bury the bigger stories of the leaks, investigations, dnc resignations, etc. If his numbers don&#39;t plummet more, he will drop out RIGHT before the election so the GOP isn&#39;t able to find a nominee in time.</p>

<p>He&#39;s 70 and a billionaire and now half the country hates his guts.</p>

<p>He could relax with his family and wife and he isn&#39;t doing that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not logical unless Trump is being paid billions. He has nothing to gain from being a plant by Clinton unles he is being paid billions. And even then, he doesn&#39;t need the money. It&#39;s not like he will be spending hundreds of millions per day until he dies (around 90 should we say).</p>
