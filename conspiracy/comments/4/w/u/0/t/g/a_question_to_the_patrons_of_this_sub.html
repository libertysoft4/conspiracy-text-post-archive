    <div class="md"><p>The JFK assassination. Even though I was not born, as soon as I could comprehend what happened, the whole series of events got me thinking about a conspiracy taking place. Now that I am older and have opened my eyes, all the conspiracy theories have a certain amount of weight to them. When 9/11 happened I knew something was not right, and 9/11 demonstrated to me how deep the rabbit hole goes. Everything is controlled by the wealthy and what we are taught and what we believe is a fabricated fairy tale. Everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three events spring to mind. When I was about 8 or younger I watched a movie with my older cousins called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097100/">Communion</a>. That inspired me to learn more about the universe and opened me up to the idea that we may not be alone.  </p>

<p>My grandfather gave me a book when I was about 12 called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zolars-Encyclopedia-Ancient-Forbidden-Knowledge/dp/0139840893">&quot;Zolar&#39;s Encyclopedia Of Ancient And Forbidden Knowledge&quot;</a>. Which piqued my interest in the occult, secret societies and &#39;alternative&#39; religions.  </p>

<p>9/11 occurred when I was a young teen. I watched TV all day and even then, as it was unfolding in front of my eyes, I didn&#39;t believe what I was being told by the media. One thing that sticks out - was the mention of a car bomb exploding at the state dept. on 9/11. It was mentioned a few times through out the day. Then basically never mentioned again - if it wasn&#39;t for a few news archives from that date, I probably would&#39;ve concluded that I was hallucinating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On my thirteenth birthday a really cool person gave me two books: On the Road (Kerouac) and Brave New World. I preferred Kerouac so much more than Huxley. So I took drugs and enjoyed my youth. I spent my 21st birthday at the largest protest in human history (in Melbourne, S11). I got off drugs after that. On my 22nd birthday, I woke up to the rolling feed: sounds, explosions and a cloud of debris straight out of Revelations. I was audited at work that day too. Shitty day for everyone, the personification of physics included. Didn&#39;t make sense then, doesn&#39;t make sense now. But it makes oh so much money. Your money&#39;s money is all that money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds so mundane, but for me it was government regulation of industries.  At work I was researching regulatory requirements for software that deals with health information.  In the course of my research it became clear to me that agencies such as the FDA and the EPA are more like PR fronts for the large players in each industry rather than being there to protect the public.  </p>

<p>I looked at the historical timeline of a few substances (lead, asbestos, DDT, etc), seeing how they were used, when they were known to be harmful, the lobbying to maintain the status quo, the PR campaigns to keep the public misinformed.  </p>

<p>Early on I read &#39;Propaganda&#39; by Bernays.  Reading about the techniques of creating public opinion made me realize that I could not simply take as truth the perceived consensus of the people around me.  I needed to reconsider a whole lot of ideas that I had previously dismissed and actively seek out ideas I had not yet been exposed to.  </p>
