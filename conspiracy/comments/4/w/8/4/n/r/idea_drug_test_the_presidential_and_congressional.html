<blockquote>
<p>I have to pee in a cup to work for $10hr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this is an action by a private company, not a government agency.  As such the private company isn&#39;t constrained by the Constitution so if they want to create a drug testing requirement for employees they are allowed.  The government is constrained by the Constitution, so drug testing could be seen as a Fourth Amendment violation as an unreasonable search.  The testing for your job is an action by a private entity and is covered by the employment contract you entered so you consented to the search by entering the contract, the testing for welfare recipients and politicians would be an action by the government, an unreasonable search by the government, and so is prohibited.  The Constitution was designed to limit the GOVERNMENT from infringing on your rights.  This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it&#39;s literally the Constitution doing EXACTLY what it was designed to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.stimmel-law.com/en/article/employee-drug-testing-federal-and-california-law">Here&#39;s a website</a> with a good analysis of the Constitutional issues of drug testing, and the particular section that most applies is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MANDATORY TESTING UNDER FEDERAL LAW
Under federal law, jobs that involve safety or security functions generally require mandatory drug testing of applicants or employees. The U.S. Department of Transportation adopted revised regulations in August 2001, and other agencies are free to adopt their own internal regulations. Likewise, many states expressly mandate drug testing for similar jobs, for example, jobs in the medical and health related fields, jobs requiring the use of machinery or vehicles, security positions, food handling jobs, or physically demanding jobs such as utilities cable line installation or climbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The drug testing for federal contracts was implemented through the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, which I didn&#39;t know before, so thanks for that.</p>

<p>The Constitutional test for whether a random drug testing program is warranted can be found <a href="http://eli.ctas.tennessee.edu/reference/governmental-employee-drug-testing-constitutional-issues">in this analysis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Court adopted a balancing test to determine whether drug testing of government employees is constitutionally permissible, finding that the governmental interests in testing must be balanced against the employee’s liberty and privacy interests to determine whether a warrant, probable cause or individualized suspicion is required in the particular context. Unless there are “special needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement” which are sufficiently compelling to overcome the individual’s privacy interests, a warrant and probable cause are required. The Supreme Court found testing without a warrant permissible in three instances: (1) customs officers involved in front-line drug interdiction; (2) customs officers who carry firearms; and (3) train operators where a documented problem with drug/alcohol related accidents existed in the industry. The Court found that employees in these positions performed duties “fraught with such risks of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of attention can have disastrous consequences.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The courts have already balanced the Fourth Amendment protections against public safety and found in favor of public safety, which is why drug testing for federal contracts is a requirement and why government agencies can require their employees to undergo random drug tests.</p>

<p>To bring this back to the point of the original post, realistically I have to retract my point that politicians aren&#39;t subject to random drug tests.  By the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 they should be, as far as I can tell, so if they aren&#39;t being randomly drug tested that seems like a failure in the execution of the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  This is exactly why people should realize that we need to do more in the area of workplace rights for the average worker in America.  Why can&#39;t the government violate your 4th amendment rights.. But it&#39;s perfectly fine as long as a corporation does it to you?  I get that it&#39;s a contract but you shouldn&#39;t have to contract away your fourth amendment rights just to get a job.  In fact isn&#39;t it kind of coercion in a way?  You&#39;re not literally forced to apply for a job that drug tests, but if literally every single job tests for it basically then isn&#39;t that effectively the same thing?</p>

<p>I just feel like we need more common sense in our laws.  Just because something is Legal™ doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good law or precedent.  I feel like often just because something is Legal people think its logical (oh yes its a voluntary contract so obviously they can contract away your constitutional rights that&#39;s the law™) without considering how really kind of fucked up that is.  (I&#39;m not trying to imply that you believe if the law is wrong or right because you didn&#39;t say I&#39;m kind of ranting about society lol)</p>

<p>I blame congress for not reigning this type of shit in 100%.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s an argument that can be made, but in practice there are lots of companies that don&#39;t drug test employees (sorry if you&#39;re not finding them but they&#39;re out there), so it ends up being an unconvincing argument when weighed against the freedom/right to contract.</p>

<p>In this case you&#39;re not actually contracting away your constitutional right.  The essence of your constitutional 4th amendment right is to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Unless you work for the government your employer is not the government.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can do that, sure, but when Congress acts they generally act either overbroadly or too narrowly focused so they either create a lot of collateral damage or create solutions that are mostly ineffective.  Another solution that might work (did work in the past) is putting the workers in a stronger bargaining position than the one they are currently in.  That happens when the workers band together and negotiate as a group instead of as individuals, but union is a dirty word in this country now because the corporations have been working against them since at least the 70s, for precisely this reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a legal analysis the government isn&#39;t violating the 4th amendment because the government isn&#39;t the one doing the drug testing action.  I would need to review contracts to see if they require it or if the companies choose to do it on their own, and that&#39;s what the decision would turn on.  It&#39;s a very narrow, compartmentalized view of the transaction, so going from the government not doing the drug testing to the government violating the 4th amendment is the leap.</p>

<p>From a common sense analysis you take a very jaded view of the government.  They aren&#39;t paying someone else to violate your rights because it&#39;s illegal for them to do it.  Violating people&#39;s rights isn&#39;t the end goal of privatizing contracts.  When it happens it&#39;s corollary to the main goal of doing things cheaper.  The whole idea behind the government paying companies to do work for them (build planes or manage resources or whatever is being contracted out) is that private companies can do the work cheaper and more efficiently than the bureaucracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They may not personally be doing the test, but giving business incentive to have &quot;drug free workplace&quot; seems like they are telling businesses to drug test employees because they can&#39;t do it themselves, so they are definitely involved. I get they want to do things cheaper, but how is it cheaper to drug test all prospective employees. It&#39;s seems like bullshit way to fight the war on drugs imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did some more research on the issue and the drug testing is required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for federal contracts for jobs that involve safety or security functions, so it is an extension of government action, but the courts have weighed the privacy interests of the individual against the public safety risks and found public safety to outweigh individual liberty in this instance.  In short, it&#39;s not a violation because the drug test is a reasonable search, and the Fourth Amendment only protects against <em>unreasonable</em> searches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing at all reasonable about drug testing.  It is essentially a war on cannabis, which is part of a war on waking up to what is being done to you.</p>

<p>Notice how it is perfectly OK to be a lecherous alcoholic at all these companies.  In fact it is often encouraged.</p>

<p>Which drug dulls your mind and which one potentially expands it?</p>

<p>I notice caffeine and sugar being consumed copiously at nearly every job in America.  Over half the people are popping pharmaceutical pills like they are nothing.  This is hypocritical insanity.</p>

<p>This is going to become a huge issue in states where cannabis is legal as individuals are being persecuted for following the law.</p>

<p>The question is where do you draw the line.  To me alcoholism, obesity from poor diets, and serotonin related pharmaceutical drugs have significantly greater negative impact on the workforce than cannabis.</p>

<p>Do not fool yourself into thinking that drug testing is anything but attempting to discover cannabis use and rooting out anyone medicating with that instead of far worse substances.  </p>

<p>Most of the really bad illegal drugs are out of your system far sooner.  The whole drug testing thing is complete bullshit.</p>

<p>Yeah, that logic never works out the way you hope. Turns out that when you put a bureaucracy in place it is generally harder to remove it, so you create this extension of the DEA or some independent group to drug test everyone in government. Great. Now you&#39;ve made your point and a candidate wants to get rid of that, but doing so means you have to fire all the people who do the testing, and he&#39;s a &quot;jobs&quot;candidate... Oops.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s federally very tricky to legalize recreational drugs. Even marijuana legalization would require downsizing the DEA, and that makes you weak on jobs! Especially in Congress, they&#39;re very sensitive to that, politically.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of the theory, but in the short term, you guarantee a reduction in jobs and almost certainly create more. That&#39;s leverage an opponent can and often does use against you to great effect.</p>

I haven&#39;t been able to smoke weed for about 4 years because my company does randoms, and in a company of only about 40 employees there&#39;s a pretty high chance of getting tested when you know that executives, management, and I suspect certain &quot;favored&quot; departments are pretty much exempt from the testing.

<p>I wish more people got this. Theres so many bullshit laws that people just say &#39;well nobody actually goes after that&#39;..THEN GET RID OF THEM. They still send a horrible message. People also like to pretend that they&#39;re just relics of the past, like texas&#39;s sodomy laws before the supreme court struck them down.  Like..everyone ignored it because theres no way anyone would go to jail for it, until someone did and you had George W Bush fighting to keep it all the way to the top. Those laws are still on the books of course, and tbh if it came up to a vote I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if we still voted to keep them even without being able to enforce them, because Texas is just that certain breed of special.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only ok with this if they have reasonable evidence to do such a test. I don&#39;t think the population should be subjected to random screenings without any evidence to warrant it just because it&#39;s illegal. That is of course why we have the 4th amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been an employer who required tests and an employee who was required to pee in a cup.  I do not believe proactive testing is proper or right.  I completely agree with you on that side.</p>

<p>On the other hand, drug testing has a place in the workforce specifically when the drugs an employee uses negatively affects their capability to perform the work requirements of the job.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I was a construction trade operations manager, I was required to order a drug test after every workplace accident.  This was to protect the company from worker&#39;s compensation claims.  I actually hated this, because the whole insurance industry is a scam.</li>
<li>Drivers should not be driving drunk or under other impairing drugs.</li>
<li>Athletes should not gain unfair advantage due to doping drugs.  This reduces athletics from a competition of skill and training to a competition of who can procure the most effective enhancement substances.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in general, I think post-incident drug testing may be acceptable.  Proactive drug testing is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Anecdotal story:  I hired a tradesman who was obviously on something during the interview.  He was acting somewhat erratically and was scratching his arms.  He was highly qualified and the interview otherwise went extremely well.  I directly asked him, &quot;I can&#39;t help but notice your physical behavior right now.  What drug are you on?&quot;  He said, &quot;I&#39;m on methodone step-down treatment from heroin addiction.&quot;  I hired him on the spot and he was absolutely the best employee I ever had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read up on neuropsychology. Any pleasurable action in life releases the same chemicals. Psychedelics can be an incredible journey, and it&#39;s REAL. LSD changes the way you experience things. It doesn&#39;t make you delusional, it creates a whole other world. The combination of this and the fact it isn&#39;t addicting make that I think it shouldn&#39;t be illegal at all. I&#39;d rather have tobacco be illegalised than Psychedelics. More harmful and dangerous. Should you be put to death for eating fast food? Because well, it works in the same way. Fuck me I don&#39;t even care that I took the bait.

<p>Eat it often enough and you&#39;ll die eventually. Taking obscene pleasure in food is definitely degenerate,  but it doesn&#39;t even begin to compare with narcomania.</p>

<p>Definitely, if you let it turn into a lifestyle or a &quot;hobby&quot;, as opposed to taking it for what it is, a useless distraction. I have seriously yet to encounter an occasion when I could seriously claim playing was a better use of my time than doing something else.</p>

<p>my understanding is that MRIs can tell if you are lyinig and it&#39;s infallible because certain areas of the brain light up to &#39;fabricate&#39; an answer; also psychopathy becomes immediately apparent to a neurologist who knows which parts of the brain are more active and less active in spychopaths</p>

<p>Are you aware that studies have found that lower income people are less likely to use drugs than higher income people? In particular, people on welfare are massively less likely to use drugs than the general public.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drugfree.org/news-service/florida-welfare-applicants-less-likely-than-general-population-to-use-drugs/">http://www.drugfree.org/news-service/florida-welfare-applicants-less-likely-than-general-population-to-use-drugs/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The national drug use rate is 9.4 percent. In these states, however, the rate of positive drug tests to total welfare applicants ranges from 0.002 percent to 8.3 percent, but all except one have a rate below 1 percent.</p>

I think if you dig into the legality of it, there are employers who are using it to discriminate, but not only that, where does it say your employer can have access to your bodily fluids for a min wage job that doesn&#39;t involve driving or policing or saving lives?</p>

<p>It is whack from the onset and puts too much power into the hands of people who only hire others. Fuck the authoritarian nonsense. Y&#39;all folks need to kibosh that bullshit with some disobedience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, what would this achieve? The problem is corruption and human limitations. You guys all have these weak ideas that can&#39;t identify the true problem(s). It&#39;s not like our government, currently, is engineered  with the health of state and citizens in mind. I think that&#39;s the basic idea  people need to come to grips with. It is not beneficial. So, as not being beneficial it is not going to rigorously screen the related aptitudes and alliances.</p>

<p>A doctor, independent or otherwise, is just as controllable as an agency with an agenda. Prone to bribery, threats or whatever other methods to be employed. And even if they weren&#39;t, the consequences for their findings would still have to be enforced by some other entity/agency.</p>

<p>It all stems from a culture of corruption. The burden of cleaning up this culture falls on the people, and the people are sleeping and ignorant, docile. We&#39;re subjects who see ourselves as subjects, perpetual children who see government as parents. So even when government is wrong, we get sent to our rooms if we point it out.</p>

<p>Our FBI is compromised. Who do we appeal to now?</p>
