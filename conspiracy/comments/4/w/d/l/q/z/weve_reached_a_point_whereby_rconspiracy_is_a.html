    <div class="md"><p>Should never get <em>all</em> your news from anywhere.</p>

<p>But this is one of the few subs where you&#39;ll hear about stuff like:</p>

<p>The DNC staffer that got killed a few weeks ago in a &quot;random mugging&quot; where nothing was stolen, the Clinton researcher (Victor Thorne) that &quot;killed himself&quot;.. and Shawn Lucas  who was personally serving the Democratic National Committee and Debbie Wasserman Schultz with a nationwide class action lawsuit ... also among the recently deceased. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget John Ashe and his &quot;freak weight room accident&quot;.</p>

<p>This is also one of the few places where people dare to speculate about patterns in events and how those events might be connected to certain people.</p>

<p>Around here, if you say it&#39;s no coincidence that people who get in the Clinton&#39;s way (or who are liable to cause them some serious inconvenience) have an unusual tendency to end up dead, many people will agree with you. Say the same thing in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and watch the same belief get ridiculed... or get you banned from that sub.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said this before and it&#39;s worth saying again now. We&#39;re lucky that so few other people take us seriously. If they did, this sub would get shut down in no time at all. So every cloud has a silver lining. If being called a tinfoil hat kook means we get to talk about some of the shit that actually goes on, it&#39;s worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The facet I find most interesting is the surge in the belief that a site like reddit has some form of importance. Outside of generating a profit, paying for its employees, and whatever other absurd notions the user-base attaches to posting articles and one-off comments, this website is of dull importance. </p>

<p>I would wager its welcomed by the intelligence community, though. Like other platforms it provides easy-access to people that might be interesting and also provides a direct feed for message delivery. Some interpret that participation to always be apparent (i.e. you disagreed with me, you are clearly a bought and paid for agent). This doesn&#39;t reflect what I believe the full scope though. </p>

<p>The goal is to obfuscate even the edges of the game board...let alone the pieces  or the rulebook. To this end, the goal is uncertain truths at all times. It is just as likely that Clinton went off and shot Rich herself, as it is that some nefarious hitman took him out, as it is that the incident was a botched robbery, as it is that Rich was a merely a figment inserted into the newsflow distract from something of far greater importance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right; it shouldn&#39;t be like that. However what do you expect? I mean after 911, and the Bush admin people were waking up in droves, almost like it was a right of passage. How many kids who would come over to the house &quot;Have you seen the zeightguist movie?&quot; And I&#39;d just smile, nod and know they were starting to wake up. This happened quite frequently until right around 2010 and all of a sudden this counter narrative popped up, and people stopped looking into the fallacies of American politics. As if; Obama had all the answers and there&#39;s no way a black man who is in office could be as a bad as Bush. And people started to believe the global domination aspect through the petro-dollar, toppling governments with proxy armies, the FED, how we are fed poison to make us more susceptible to the lies. Then occupy wall street happened, and I was like &quot;FUCKING FINALLY!&quot; It seems that  the occupy movement scared the shit out of the elite, and they cracked down hard on this information campaign. Israel being the main attacker in laying waste to the average conspiracy theorist by calling them anti-Semitic and stuffing at anyone critizing Israeli-US realations etc.</p>

<p>Were fighting back thlugh, and this election cycle if nothing else has woken a lot of people up.</p>
