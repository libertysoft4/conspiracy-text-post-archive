<p>Makes you wonder if everything is backwards.  </p>

<p>What if the anti-Christ is Christianity itself.  Christianity is responsible for millions and millions of deaths over the last 1500 years.  God smited more people in the bible than the devil did. </p>

<p>There is a being that sits on &quot;a golden throne&quot; and is called by different names, we designated it with gnostics&#39; name - Demiurge - The God imposter. This being is in control of archons, it poses as a god and &quot;creator of the Universe&quot;. It uses many names: God, YHWH, Yahweh, Adonay (Holy Lamb, even Jesus, even Trinity), Allah, Buddha, Brahma, Krishna, Shiva, Vishnu; from old &quot;pagan&quot; Wotan, Quetzalcoatl, Baal, Jupiter, Zeus (Dyeus, Deus, Dios, Theos, Dyaus Pita, Jupiter, Jov Pater, Zeu Pater, Dyau Pita - means literally Sky Father on contrary to Pltvi Mhter - Mother Earth also it&#39;s name, a proto indo-european origin of name God and Dios), it is also calling itself with female names like Gaia, Great Mother, Ishtar, Mithra, Goddess, even Source and even One; on evil part also known as Lucifer, Satan, Shaitan, Devil, Moloch, Baal, Baalzebub, Marduk, Saint Death, Pan, Satyr, Baphomet. (To mention also that in judaism satan is an agent of God and &quot;tempter&quot; of Humanity, so basically here, they are one and the same.) This is to mention just most prominent of it&#39;s names to give You a picture of how influential it is. The secret 2 names for this being are jewish &quot;Yod - Ha - Veh - Hah&quot; - &quot;I exist, I am&quot; and reptilian name &quot;Shem - Ham - Pho - Rash&quot; - literally &quot;you are my servants, I am your master&quot; used in teaching Kabbalah where kaballah equal to cabal - &quot;secret magic occult societies under the tree of life&quot;. On kaballah&#39;s tree of life You can see Moon blocking the Earth from Cosmo - universal Consciousness of One which comes through Galactic Center and through Sun.</p>

<p>What  does that even mean? Exactly how do you put forth information about a controversial subject without some kind of bias? Do you live in some kind of fantasy land where random people randomly uncover information and then for no explicable reason they decide to take the time and effort to write a book or make a video about it?

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Try this one.</p>

<p>The Vatican is luciferian because it is surrounded with pagan shit that has nothing to do with Jesus and everything to do with self worship. The statues of Mary are really Semiramis, as idol worship is forbidden in the teachings of Jesus and in the Ten Commandments. </p>

<p>The real kicker...</p>

<p>The pope is given the term vicarious christi, the vicar of christ. He is basically Jesus on earth in the flesh and blood. If the pope&#39;s word should contradict the teachings of Christ or the bible, catholic doctrine states that the pope&#39;s word should take precedent. That is about as close to self worship as you can get (which is the essence of luciferianism and most satanism).</p>

<p>If you think Catholicism is in line with Jesus I highly encourage you to research The Black Pope and The Jesuits. The pope is a snake and Catholicism is a bastardization of Jesus&#39; teachings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the essence of Luciferianism is that God feared man becoming intelligent and independent and Lucifer rebelled against God by trying to give man knowledge (Apple eating is symbolic of this) God found out, punished Lucifer and man and basically the bible is propaganda.</p>

<p>Luciferianism = God is a mean propagandist, with the bible as his media. Lucifer was trying to help make man independent and was shunned and shot down for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s more interesting is that the King Alfred Plan / Rex 84 was created in order to round up Blacks/Hispanics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Genesis 15:13</strong> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Slavery started 1619 it is 2016.</p>

<p>What I believe is that the Zionist are trying to start Martial Law in order to start Rex 84. </p>

<p>Here is why, in the plans, it states that FEMA will take over State and Federal levels of government. In which small white supremacist militias will help FEMA round up blacks &amp; Hispanics.</p>

<p>In the Bible, in the Book of Jeremiah, it speaks of Jacobs trouble.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 30:7King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>7 Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob&#39;s trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we know, Rothschild is connected to founding the confederacy, the transatlantic slave trade, the Vatican and the government state of Israel. It is also known that these people in Israel are not the Biblical Jews but modern day Jewry.</p>

<p>They will not be able to do it while Obama is in office, it says this in the Bible when Jacob talked to his children in the last days concerning the tribe of Dan. If you know anything about the Danites, they broke away from the other tribes and fell into sin much earlier then the rest of the Hebrews. I believe this was done to hide their true intentions for 1000&#39;s of years.</p>

<p>Someone posted earlier that Jesse Ventura claimed that the establishment might have Trump assassinated because they might like Mike Pence more. Well, this would give the perfect reason to establish nation wide marital law or the chain of events that follow would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a crazy theory the other day: the reason Israel is so concerned with forcing refugees from africa and the middle east into europe and the united states, the reason they so heavily push multiculturalism in western countries, is so that they can have the middle east all to themselves after they nuke the rest of the planet under the pretense of starting the end of days. </p>

<p>Basically: agitate to send muslim immigrants into the western world so when they start their jihad to create a global caliphate, israel&#39;s leadership can justify blowing everyone up. Talk about the ultimate holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Globalism and Zionism are not the same, they are different ideals.</p>

<p>Zionism is upholding white supremacy borders that keep the people separated, this in turn creates a pyramid of both racial and class supremacy. This is because once you remove this barrier and people stop using fear and hate, no doubt that the white race would surely disappear because once black starts mixing with white, you will get brown and slowly over time the world is brown again. The only way for the white race to actually exist is through war and hate. Because once this simple, yet powerful evil idea is defeated, people will not want to feel fear and hate anymore, thus people get along, people have kids, people prosper.</p>

<p>Globalism is removing barriers of white supremacy, this in turn will no doubt cause more interracial couples that will have interracial babies thus the world is naturally go back to it&#39;s original starting point, mostly brown eyes all around the world. So in essence George Soros is funding the refugees not with evil intent but to move them into white areas to protect them. The evil happens when stranded Syrians wash up ashore and instead of a helping hand, they run into Zionism or white supremacy AKA the barrier mentioned above under Zionism. It was already clear that Syria would be a warzone according to conspiracy videos pre 2005 and before. Therefore, those people had to be moved once ISIS (Zionist Mercs) basically took over Syria.</p>

<p>In other words, by moving these minorities out of heavily single populated areas, they have been saved from such a nuclear strike because the Zionist will not strike their own kind because it defeats the purpose. </p>

<p>Example, moving a million black Syrians into Germany would make it more complicated for them to drop Nukes on these people.</p>

<p>This helps remove nuclear warfare off the table in the short run, not the long run, it would seem that the globalist are not on the attack but on the defense. They are waiting for something.</p>

<p>If you still hold the narrative that ISIS is controlled by Islam at the top, you are indeed mislead. </p>

<p>Israel controls ISIS</p>

<p>Israeli Secret Intelligence Service.</p>

<p>Go through all of Alex Jones videos, you will hear him say Globalist or blame the Muslims or any other minority group you can. <strong>But he will never say Zionist.</strong></p>

<p>In the instance of BLM, this too is a way to fight the Zionist with protest and debate. This is why the establishment controlled by the Zionist here in America are trying everything from null arguments to setting up false flags against the group, basically anything to make it look like a terrorist group. </p>

<p>If you search up some of the migrant attacks you will find that a lot of the big stories they covered are indeed fake. They take pictures of women who had been fighting and say that it was a migrant but you can easily find the other story on the internet. Which supports the narrative I am not just talking out my ass.</p>

<p>This in noway shape or form means that there aren&#39;t bad people out there, I&#39;d be a fool to claim so.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about self worship. Making yourself into God. </p>

<p>In certain Christian lure, Lucifer&#39;s aim is not to get you to worship Him. It&#39;s to educate and enlighten you to the point of unlocking the little slice of God in all of us. While this sounds great and innocent, one must examine the fruits of supposed Christians and Luciferians labors. Often times, they are quite hideous. Some wish to bring about the end times and some wish to bring about the pagan trinity (which some believe will simultaneously fulfill Jewish requirements for their messiah). The perfect human.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I believe I do understand it. I believe that it still applies to us all. We should not make God into an image like to corruptable man. The concept of &quot;aliens&quot; is a concept derived from corruptable man. God never refers to Himself as an &quot;alien&quot; in scripture. We can just agree to disagree on this if you don&#39;t see it the way I do. I don&#39;t believe the first image is of Jesus, because Christ most likely had short hair. However, his hair is described as being &quot;white as wool.&quot; The common types of sheep native to the middle east have blonde-colored wool. Given that Christ was what, 30, when He was crucified, the biblical description that his hair was &quot;as white as wool&quot; makes me conclude that it wasn&#39;t <em>gray</em> because I don&#39;t imagine that Christ&#39;s person would have aged after his death. Regardless, I think the hair and skin color of Christ is absolutely irrelevant to salvation and true faith. And no, we shouldn&#39;t be worshipping and plastering images of Him anywhere. Even if it were an accurate depiction. Fortunately I have never personally participated in this behavior.</p>

<p>As for the corruption with the image of white Jesus, yes, it is a sin. Plastering it all over the church is a bigger sin, wearing it on crosses and chains is a even bigger sin. Hell people will even claim that they wear it because Jesus died for their sins but any righteous man/woman knows this is a lie. For Jesus followed the ways of the Old Testament.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 5:17-20King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p>

<p>18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p>

<p>19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So until we are done, everyone shall be punished for their sins. Jesus died to solidify his testament, not for the sins of people.</p>

<p>Good day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao I initially made my first comment short &amp; snippy because I saw the 2nd link you shared and thought you were one of those &quot;Jesus was black! Black people are the true Jews!&quot; guys. And I was like &quot;oh boy, I&#39;m not even gonna get into it with this guy!&quot; </p>

<p>The Bible as far as I know doesn&#39;t mention anything about the color of Jesus&#39;s skin. I doubt He was a pale guy though, considering He went about travelling in the sun. However, the Bible does describe Solomon&#39;s skin as being &quot;white and ruddy&quot; in Song of Solomon. And we know from the biblical genealogy, Jesus was descended from Solomon. But we don&#39;t know from that what Jesus&#39; skintone was, because there could have been various mixing of skin tones from that point on.</p>

<p>I tell people sometimes, &quot;Those depictions people like to put up of this long-haired Jesus Christ - I wouldn&#39;t doubt it if that&#39;s exactly what the antichrist looks like!&quot; Not only that, but the world is also so wont to depict Satan as a man with short, blonde hair when there is absolutely no evidence of his appearance. Smh. Everything is twisted. But these are just some things I think of regarding the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna go with &quot; the bringer of light&quot; interpretation, either in direct reference to visually illuminating the night sky through the telescope, or as the bringer of light in the form of knowledge, illuminating the darkness of our ignorance. I would imagine this is the intent of the name, as an intensely secret society probably wouldn&#39;t  reveal thier true intentions and belief systems so publicly.     or I could be wrong and lizard people in the center of the earth control our minds telepathically with crystal skulls. what the fuck do I know</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great catch.  Don&#39;t you know that the Pope Francis was one step from being superior general in the Jesuits when he was ordained white pope?  Also, he changed the &#39;no catholics can be freemasons&#39; rule, so now they can.  Know why?  Because he&#39;s himself a freemason.  So we have a freemason, jesuit, (probably some kind of knight order) pope.  </p>

<p>Of course we have a lucifer telescope!  We also have a lucifer hella pope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lucifer is a loosh sniffer.  Loosh is spiritual food for masters of self-service at the expense of others.  It is stolen spiritual energy.  Spiritual energy is that which animates the soul which animates the body, essentially animating matter.  It is created during experiences of positive emotions, love, laughter, joy, witnessing beauty, feeling gratitude, giving and receiving good will from others, etc.  Experiences that create spiritual energy make one feel more like living and doing things in life, inspired, motivated, alive.  Spiritual energy is released during experiences of negative emotions, fear, suffering, anger, hatred, anxiety, loss, etc.  Experiences that release spiritual energy make one feel less like living and doing things in life, depressed, drained, suicidal.</p>

<p>Many years ago, this planet became a farm for negative ETs, adepts at service to the self at the expense of others.  They covertly contaminated the planet with minions, machinations and causes of fear and suffering.  &quot;Satanic&quot; rituals are designed to produce loosh by generating fear and suffering.  Sadists enjoy stealing this energy.  Miserable people that get a high when others around them become miserable also enjoy this energy.  Animals that torment their prey enjoy this energy.  It&#39;s a very dark aspect of our reality.  We&#39;d like to deny this energy transfer occurs, but it explains things that baffle us.  It&#39;s why <del>demons</del> negative ETs like to cause fear, suffering, slavery and destruction.  It&#39;s a lot of fun for them.  Without it, they feel empty inside, drained by their constant emotional states of fear, used by <em>their</em> overlords to maintain control and also for fun.</p>

<p>This is not hard to understand, but is hard to accept.  Positive emotions, positive beings, and positive civilizations produce spiritual energy.  Neutral beings and civilizations do too.  Negative emotions, negative beings, and negative civilizations generally don&#39;t produce a net amount of spiritual energy and so seek to enslave and harm others to obtain this spiritual energy.  Without it, life seems boring, empty and meaningless.  Some negative beings and civilizations have been stuck in negative emotions and thought patterns for a long time.  This causes them to seek to distill reality down to its constituent parts and put it into mental boxes in order to maximize competitiveness, to avoid suffering the abusive behavior of others, and to be able to secure others as slaves to obtain spiritual energy.  This loosh consuming behavior is like a disease, similar to zombies.  Except, you would have to get bitten enough for you to see the world as fear, suffering and competition almost exclusively.  At that point, you&#39;re infected and infect others.  Sometimes love can disinfect, but it takes both parties wanting that outcome.</p>
