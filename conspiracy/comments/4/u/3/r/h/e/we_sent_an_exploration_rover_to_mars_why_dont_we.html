<p>Every time something new is designed, problems need to be solved. </p>

<p>Every new plane that is designed has to solve the whole gravity and lift thing. That doesn&#39;t stop planes from flying nor from new designs being produced.</p>

<p>The width of the belts varies.</p>

<p>All craft were shielded, since by the nature of being in space they were exposed to radiation.</p>

<p>Going though it is very different from standing around in it</p>

<p>Yes, light flashes are commonly reported among astronauts- your point? Coincidentally, astronauts have an unusual rate of cataract development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you want to get into the details, we&#39;re going to head into dirty water because, again, as a lifelong aerospace lover; the data is murky.  </p>

<p>Of course the &quot;spaceships&quot; have to be shielded.  If you study the X planes and other skunk work type planes you will learn about the shielding they use against the extreme heat caused by atmospheric friction on the airframe.  These materials only handle heat radiation though and some minimal electromagnetic radiation (radar absorbing paint that really doesn&#39;t help all that much).  What does the Apollo capsules use? That&#39;s right, something that didn&#39;t exist in the 60&#39;s unless they had the means to push tons of iron up there.</p>

<p>All critical components were rad-hardened. The LM also had a coating which reduced incoming xray dosage.</p>

<p>Why would NASA want to waste money sending a Curiosity type rover now? We know pretty much everything about the moon. </p>

<p>And the moon has been mapped. </p>

<p>Terrible thread, 1/10 for research and jumping to a fairly simple and stupid conclusion. Yet as usual for this sub as of late, every moron and his dog is agreeing with you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you want to get into the details, we&#39;re going to head into dirty water because, again, as a lifelong aerospace lover; the data is murky.  </p>

<p>Of course the &quot;spaceships&quot; have to be shielded.  If you study the X planes and other skunk work type planes you will learn about the shielding they use against the extreme heat caused by atmospheric friction on the airframe.  These materials only handle heat radiation though and some minimal electromagnetic radiation (radar absorbing paint that really doesn&#39;t help all that much).  What does the Apollo capsules use? That&#39;s right, something that didn&#39;t exist in the 60&#39;s unless they had the means to push tons of iron up there.</p>
