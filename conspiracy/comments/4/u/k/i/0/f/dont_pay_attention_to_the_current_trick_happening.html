<p>2.She is revealing the criminal aspect of the current political system</p>

<p>3.A Clinton Foundation leak would expose her foreign sabotage of US for her foundation  interests.</p>

<p>4.If you pay attention to media undertones, Clearly  Mika Brzezinski is the only Liberal media figure criticizing Hillary, but she is the most important one, and this tells us something is up...hmmm...Mika calls Wasserman for resignation in May and bam! Wasserman is gone in two months later!</p>

<p>5.The Elite would never force an obviously hated and corrupt Leader when they can trick us with a seemingly harmless one we believe in to help us. This is the real magic trick, the one we don&#39;t see in front of us.</p>

<p>So while Hillary may step down or lose, she was the real distraction the whole time. This is the clever slight of hand.</p>

<p>Recall Tolkien’s works. <strong>“I think a servant of the Enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.”</strong> If Trump <em>was</em> controlled opposition, he would superficially appear to be a bad goy, but his policies would all serve Jewish and Israeli interests. He’s not.</p>
