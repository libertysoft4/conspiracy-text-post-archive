<p>It looks like when ever a former &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; ends up being right people stop treating it like it was ever a conspiracy theory and then continue to shit on all other conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Not a healthy outlook from the mainstream</p>

<p>R/conspiracy is never going to get love as long as it continues to allow posts about whackjob theories. Especially those around right wing Christian conservatives who post about Satanism and the occult. Those posts make people roll their eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not saying all these things are in of themselves wrong or terrible (most are) but people have associations about them. Negative associations.&quot; </p>

<p>Yes, the Builderberg Group is actually something we should be more aware and very wary of. But the general public doesn&#39;t have that association. They see it as a whack job conspiracy theory. The words &quot;Builderberg Group&quot; are associated with negative and dismissive thoughts in the public&#39;s mind. Which is why I included it on the list. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what is actually being said in r/conspiracy, as long as people associate it with crazy whackjobs, everything posted here will be put under the pressure of extra scrutiny and doubt because &quot;this has just gotta be crazy people, right?!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was trying to highlight. </p>

<p>But no, I&#39;m a government shill. Stop being so quick to judge and try to read between the lines. My original post has very clear context. My opening words are &quot;For every decent post there&#39;s 19 going on about [things people think are crazy conspiracy things]&quot;. For every DECENT post. There is good stuff happening here. But it will be ignored so long as people <em>think</em> 95% of the stuff here is whack. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;(most are)&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Builderberg Group: - Ok, this is real.</li>
<li>Flat Earth: - Bogus.</li>
<li>Illuminati: - Are rich people working together? Yes. Are they the <em>actual</em> Illumanati? I seriously doubt it what with there being not a single piece of evidence for that. </li>
<li>UFOs: - They&#39;re experimental aircraft. It&#39;s what? 5-10% they can&#39;t explain? That&#39;s interesting. But I usually see the 90% obvious stuff on here.</li>
<li>Satanism: - This is a special form of paranoia that&#39;s as dangerous as Islamic terrorism, if you ask me.</li>
<li>Symbology: - Quite similar to above. Sure, there are common symbols and themes everywhere you look. Might have something to do with a common, shared global culture what with people taking inspiration from each other and from past relics/ideas/etc. So basically, bogus. </li>
</ol>

<p>So, what one, maybe two things are actually a thing? The rest are just fantasy. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a weird tendency to dismiss an entire person&#39;s argument when the say one tiny thing you disagree with. I&#39;ve been banned for <em>suggesting</em> that the main narrative might actual be right before. There&#39;s as much free discourse on this sub as there is on r/worldnews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To acknowledge the Lies would shake the Foundations upon which their material and psychological Comfort rests. If they suddenly change and acknowledge certain Truths, then they risk losing Job and/or Career, Fellowship and Esteem of various Friends, Home, Family, essentially everything save for their own SelfRespect. Should you choose to accept the Humiliation, Pain and Suffering associated with acknowledging the Truth anyway, the Trick to surviving is to immediately build oneself a new Life, seek a new Circle of Colleagues and Friends and find  a new Partner and/or Family with whom you can at least  tolerate and maybe even accept the Truths you espouse. Failing any of the above, adopt a Dog. They are great Listeners (although not always good at following Instructions).    </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong, but is there ANY evidence of this at all?  As soon as the DNC is proven to have been conspiring against sanders, now they&#39;re hiding behind a conspiracy theory?

    <div class="md"><p>To be perfectly honest I myself believe in less conspiracies than the majority of this sub.</p>

<p>However, I was commenting on a larger societal issue. One where people disregard that some conspiracy theories are true, and proceed to act like they&#39;re <em>all</em> impossible.</p>

<p>It seems to me that any rational individual would believe in at least some level of conspiracy, given how many have been proven true in the past. It&#39;s undeniable that our government has been up to shady stuff they don&#39;t want us to know about.</p>

<p>Disregard what I said about this sub getting no love then. It&#39;s understandable when people see things like the moon landing being faked.</p>

<p>But the fact is conspiracy theories in general have a bad stigma. Again, even though a large amount of them have been proven true. This doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said it&#39;s odd that this sub gets no love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I myself believe in less conspiracies than the majority of this sub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason it gets no love is because of the amount of bullshit conspiracies.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why, it&#39;s nothing crazy here.  It&#39;s not a societal issue.  It&#39;s the fact that many in this sub just go all out on every possibility in life as a conspiracy.  Many who frequent here will go after anything without ANY PROOF.  Asking for a source or proof can provide you with many people who will say you&#39;re a shill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that any rational individual would believe in at least some level of conspiracy, given how many have been proven true in the past. It&#39;s undeniable that our government has been up to shady stuff they don&#39;t want us to know about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea people do believe in at least some level of conspiracy.  Yet most of us aren&#39;t going to act like a &quot;sheep&quot;, I want fucking proof.  How hard is that to understand?  Proof.  Proof.  Actual proof, not some weird conspiracy site that says they saw the boogeyman fuck Obama.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, even though a large amount of them have been proven true. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here we have the problem.  A large amount of them have not been proven true.  So stop there.  If you actually follow conspiracies you&#39;d know a small portion have been proven true.  </p>

<p>You even state yourself you believe in less conspiracies than this sub, why don&#39;t you believe in a large amount of them if they&#39;re largely true?</p>

<p>Because they aren&#39;t largely true.</p>

<p>The reason this sub isn&#39;t loved is simple.  You deny wanting to have facts.  You deny waiting for all the information.  You make up tons of things without any actual proof.  Tons of threads like that.  Great 1 out of 1000 gotten right.  My cat could poop out better answers than that.</p>

<p>Disregard what I said about this sub getting no love then. It&#39;s understandable when people see things like the moon landing being faked.</p>

<p>Obviously I should&#39;ve named the thread something else. I don&#39;t deny what you&#39;ve said, but conspiracy in general has a negative stigma. It&#39;s not just from people that want proof, it&#39;s people that treat anyone that believes <em>any</em> conspiracy as crazy.</p>

<p>Good to know it was coherent. And I would suggest that you are expressing your opinion, which is divorced from the fact. But, again, you rely on an attack on the credibility of those interacting in this sub. &quot;Crazy.&quot; A good litmus test for when you should be exceptionally skeptical of someone, is their use (or over-use) of the word &quot;crazy.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And disabling the CSS...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stops that image from coming up for me... I don&#39;t care to see what image is promoted, so I remove it myself.</p>

<p>What <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> supports will require a better definition of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Is that the user base of readers and/or subscribers or do you mean the mod team? Or something else?</p>

<p>Is there a reason you are so upset with our sub?</p>
