<p>You must be new to the whole &quot;conspiracy scene&quot;. Yes he is an over the top character/archetype playing a role.  Just google &quot;Alex Jones Stratfor&quot;. Employees of info wars have been outed as coming from CIA front groups like Stratfor. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TACalwg360c">He&#39;s gone to pro gun rallies with the bullhorn just to disrupt the rally</a>  Just use a search engine and you will find 100&#39;s more examples.  </p>

<p>I used to listen to him years ago like everyone else that starts learning about 9/11/false flags etc.  He gives probably 90% truths but mixes it with lies on important issues.  After awhile you start to realize that he is just there to keep peoples consciousness in a controllable box. William Cooper called Alex out 15 years ago.  Of course the feds killed Bill but somehow Alex is still alive after all this time.</p>

<p>He also goes on mainsteam media stations and screams like a mad man so everyone watching sees &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as raving nut jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree with William Cooper&#39;s large assessment that he&#39;s somewhat of a bullshit artist and sensationalist. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s directly controlled and an agent per se but smart enough to realize that focusing on Zionism/Israel/Jews will lead to the downfall of his show, not to mention that his wife was Jewish..</p>

<p>He also exaggerates EVERYTHING he talks about and always pulls the &quot;It&#39;s in the files/books/tapes&quot; to make everything he says credible. The thing is though that all of the stuff he talks about(At least for the past 5-6 years) always has some little truth to it and he will always use that in case someone tries to argue with him.</p>

<p>Add that to the fact all the supplements and commercials from his sponsors that he is pushing to his listeners it just seems a lot more likely that he&#39;s trying to maintain an equilibrium between waking people up and making money, rather than being cointelpro.</p>

<p>To be fair he screams like a mad man in a lot of his broadcasts which has resulted in some of the most hilarious clips on the web.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you a few things. 1. What he talks about on his shows is information I am finding else where as well, that backs up what he is saying. 2. Yes he never digs into Israel and we get why. 3. He&#39;s MAD AS HELL as EVERYONE needs to be! We have to get mad before we can come together to make something happen...</p>

<p>Just my two cents...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, he had many, many of those instances already. Most of them faker than Coco&#39;s tits, but some were actual full-blown meltdowns in which he basically imploded on his own toxic, incessant bipolar agitation. </p>

<p>Imagine vulnerable people like paranoid meth addicts on a 3 day no-sleep binge accidentally tuning in to his 24/7 agitprop (which is everywhere) ... They go out psychotic and hurt themselves and/or others. That&#39;s one of the main reasons he gets to still be on the air I think.

<p>And, all those poor, non-Jewish, Western European people (who out number the Jewish persons involved 10 to 1)  in the various nefarious plots are ... automatons under a web of Jewish mind control?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me personally? I&#39;m pretty neutral when it comes to Jewish people. </p>

<p>There are bad elements, just like any other race/religion. </p>

<p>They do have a fair share of global financial interests, but I think a lot of that is a common theme within their culture, same as Americans, they want to exceed &amp; influence. </p>

<p>I think the reason they learnt about the control of the media was the large lesson learnt from Joseph Goebbels  ie Nazi party. </p>

<p>This of course is a passion shared with the American elite, who&#39;ve used propaganda the same way. </p>

<p>TL;DR Jews are a convenient scapegoat and broad generalizations hurt the search for truth when you only focus on the Jews and not the whole picture. </p>

<p>The Jews are not responsible for every damn thing that happens </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not everything. The slaughter of millions in the USSR under the Bolsheviks. The complete takeover of our Western media for propaganda purposes. The control and mismanagement of our wealth. Billions of our tax dollars sent to Israel every year in supposed &quot;aid.&quot; The utter corruption of our political system. And lately, an on-going campaign of genocide against the white race. Among other things.</p>
