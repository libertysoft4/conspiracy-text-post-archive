        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This sub has been taken over by political corruption news, mixed with political scandal news, mixed with political &quot;insert word here&quot;news. I am sure it is a deliberate attempt that is now (in my worldview) succeeding in completely keeping us away from really talking about anything that matters here. I assume they use that since it&#39;s popular and so easy
to get emotionally charged responses even from intelligent people who usually otherwise know better. Every single day, for what feels like at least a week or two, the entire top 20 posts either have Hillary or DNC or Trump in the title, or some variation of the subject matter.  We have been inundated since this election cycle got so fucking insane a few months ago, but I personally feel completely saturated by it when I try to spend any amount of time on here. It feels gross. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not naive, I know the whole of Reddit has been flipped, fucked, and hung out to dry when it comes to purity of organic discussion or any other positive attribute it used to have, ok. But I always felt on our little sub, if absolutely nothing else, this sub&#39;s members who still have brain cells were still able to at least wade through, and manage to get relevant information seen and/or discussed. Don&#39;t know,  and IMHO it really doesn&#39;t matter at this point if it is because the over the top paid professional &quot;shilling&quot; has gotten unbeatable in their collective power, or if people have just given up trying to have sane discussion here. I know I&#39;m almost at that point on a personal level, and many a Reddit user has come before me who were 100x smarter than I&#39;ll ever be, have come to this same conclusion, with this mass exodus really picking up during the great Pao scandal. The rest of us got played pretty fucking bad in the end when it comes to that  saga. The majority who remained have trickled off ever since then. </p>

<p>If I stumbled across this sub today, I would not have fallen in love with it like I did many years ago for just having this beautiful concentrated wealth of information pertaining to reality (like the real reality so few know of), with its deep, researched, original, commentary and discussions. I wouldn&#39;t given a second thought to investing anything whatsoever here. </p>

<p>The measure of success to most for this sub will be something superficial like the subscriber count, and will ride this puppy to the end thinking they are really learning something or part of something &quot;cool&quot;. But in my mind it is almost dead, or maybe even seriously dead. The life and soul has left the building, and basically what we have is the proverbial lifeless body we still have here at web URL <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a> ...and it only exists in nothing but namesake only. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, this place was the key to opening my eyes. I guess this served as some kind of emotional send off for me personally. </p>

<p>Go to GLP and have a look around. Nothing but racist hate and attacks on anyone that dares to suggest events like the one in Nice might not be legit. And be prepared to get attacked, not just by posters, but fn admins too.</p>

<p>Or…go to ATS and make a post about Sandy Hook suggesting that it was all horseshit and prepare to get chastised or banned.</p>

<p>The entire subculture is being co-opted and turned against itself. </p>

<p>You have paid operatives from multiple agencies and groups, including the military, setting up fake personas to propagandize from within.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may exist and i&#39;m not aware of it, but their is no large open online community where we work together and entertain any idea people come up with till we figure it out one way or the other. There is more than one conspiracy theory that literally STARTED on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and is now known and accepted as fact world wide. Obviously, if someone posted a brand new self researched idea that no one else mentioned, they would be downvoted off the page before anyone even entertained the idea of reading it, even though that is how we got to this point of near collapse of humanity because even us who are awoke, WERE GUILTY AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER OF THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE SHIT, and the majority of people around here act so enlightened yet still do that with shit like flat earth or no planes 9/11. Sure they are probably disinfo, but god forbid you be bothered to research and prove it to themselves one way or the other and then post that for us all to see. Nope, the same shit we go on and on about the masses being so blind to, is fucking RAMPANT in this supposed place that used to support higher level thinking...</p>

<p>I see people on here who have no problem accepting that 9/11 was brought down by demolition and that JFK was a conspiracy for 100% fact, for most of us we dont even blink but as we know the layman looks at that and thinks those believers are fucking looney. Yet somehow we continue the cycle on a whole new shitty fucked up level and then some people here will just SCOFF at the thought of a new crazy idea being presented before using critical thinking to realize that, hey, thesen new ideas don&#39;t sound any crazier than the classic 100% legit conspiracies did the first time someone brought the theory of those up. We have been completely vindicated many times that these insane complex high level conspiracies do and will continue to exist. Yet why the fuck do even the supposed awake people around here act like the dam sheep do about 9/11 and JFK?</p>

<p>But ya, good luck finding anywhere especially thats fairly accessible, that comes with the level of respect, cooperation, and openness <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> once embodied. And if you find it, for the love of sky daddy please tell me about it! And sorry for the rant, i&#39;m on fire tonight and frankly don&#39;t give a fuck who may get annoyed by pixels on a screen that they can scroll away from. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Add to this the blatant conspiracy by the DNC to exclude Sanders, which is a legitimate issue for this subreddit, as is the endless list of corruption accusations that have been levelled at Hillary, and Donald Trump&#39;s mysterious intentions, it is inevitable that US politics figures highly on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at the moment. </p>

<p>This political over-saturation may be regrettable, but it would be strange if these stories weren&#39;t prominent. And at the end of the day, they only get to the front page because users are upvoting them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like any other movement that starts to gain traction, the entire Bernie thing has been perverted, flipped, fucked sidewayz from the inside out, and now people equate the Sanders movement with Bernie Bros mentality and shilling for him at all costs and the narrative is written in a backroom somewhere by cocksucker lawyers for CNN and friends to make us believe.

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t understand some of you people like wow...this post has just as many upvotes as downvotes, so as of right now it has like 15 downvotes. Really? OF ALL THE GARBAGE on this sub anymore, my stupid little rant was that worthless to 15 different people? It&#39;s a rare occassion that some original thoughts were put down and presented and its downvoted just as much as upvoted. </p>

<p>So ya, that fact is enough to prove what i said above is not dramatized exaggerated bullshit. As you see, using your brain and trying to contribute to the discussion is now considered not only worthless, but no one should have to be bothered with that filth and downvoted. </p>

<p>I&#39;m being serious guys...Either we are really are fucking doomed as a community and my OP has been proven correct, or the bots are taking care of business and in that case what i said should hold a little more weight when your considering whether to entertain it, for the fact that some entity gives a fuck enough to work at hiding it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that almost anytime something is downvoted into oblivion that isn&#39;t obviously hateful or mean spirited, it&#39;s because it&#39;s true and they are trying to hide it without just censoring shit left and right. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The damage will already be done as far as having any meaningful amount of members still here with brains that still appear to actually function, and most people don&#39;t stop and think about the simple fact that most people are lurkers, and the well thought out, intelligent individuals are the one who fill us with content (when reddit works like it&#39;s supposed to in theory which we know it no longer does...) and decent comments that stir thought and make you think of something a little different, and then the conversation explodes with smart and dumb asses alike. Now, unless your measure of success and thriving on reddit is what subs number of subscribers (i touched on this in the OP cause many idiots use this as a gauge) and in that case, then sure it will rebound by that measure like this is a fucking popularity contest or something, and hey!...that&#39;s fine if someone is simple enough to be happy with the quantity over quality in this situation but i&#39;m not interested in reading it lol.</p>

<p>IMHO...I&#39;m wondering by your comparison of this year to prior election years and speaking like it&#39;s just business as usual in the collective consciousness and all is normal with the &quot;machinery&quot; that runs this fucked up operation we call a free country HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA TROLOLOL (ok sorry), then i and everyone reading this should take it as a red flag signifying you may be ill informed or do not understand the massive break with the norm this cycle has been and the domino effect on the future of humanity the world will feel for years if not forever. Take a step back, pretend it&#39;s 15 years ago or earlier and computer the fact that our next president will either be one of the most criminal and corrupt human beings to ever hold the office and is evil to the core, or a fucking famous tv persona (i know he&#39;s more than just that) who says the most off color shit and it makes him more popular. Your telling me, that our parents or grandparents generation would be dumb founded by this if your processing it into that context? Come on now...this is unprecedented by a mile. </p>

<p>America lost and no one won this election. And we know that to be the results already unless sky daddy works some type of epic miracle on the world and the fucking vote is still months away. I&#39;m sorry, no prior generation would shrug their shoulders and go on with there pointless menial life while the world burned. No my friend, that&#39;s somewhat a new level of fucking American stupidity and this election has cemented that fact to the world, meanwhile our grandparents lived in a country that was the envy of the world and the gold standard of civilization. IDK about you guys but i&#39;m embaressed as fuck of the country we live in. I hope the rest of the world understands that so many of us Americans do not agree with one single thing our gov does. I doubt it though, and we are basically the evil empire of the world. You know, what we tried to accuse Russia of and still do? How fucking ironic that WE ARE THE EVIL EMPIRE AND WE ARE THE TERRORISTS. LOOK NO FURTHER.</p>

<p>Not trying to be insulting but anyone who can&#39;t or hasn&#39;t picked up on the massive sea change occuring in the political world and elsewhere most likely doesn&#39;t have a lot to say that i want to waste my time listening to. So again, i apologize if i misunderstood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on my friend! There is definitely a change not only in the political arena but the whole world. The crazy weather, WWIII preparations, to the crazy people running for president. Half the people I talk to don&#39;t know that there is, in fact, 30+ people running for president, but it&#39;s illogical that only two of them actually get face time with the american public. </p>

<p>This country doesn&#39;t want either of them, and the ones that do...well yeah. I wish there was a way for the rest of the world to know how a true American feels about all this shit. Our own country is painting us in a horrible light on the world stage, and I for one don&#39;t want to be apart of the &quot;act&quot;.  </p>

<p>This election still seems like a lifetime away. In four months a lot of things can happen, and only time will tell. Until then we conspire, and keep up the good fight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems the overall feeling of the general public is &quot;we are oversaturated and pretty much had our fill of this 4 year charade already. Do whatever it is your gonna do and get it over with.&quot; Sheep take it that it&#39;s just all too complex anymore in this horrid violent crazy world, and they will just let the professionals handle it while they go watch Seinfeld, and all awhile, those who are awake already know for a fact that we have literally zero influence, so to expend any energy on this election is literally a waste of time when we have a planet who is dying before our eyes and countless other ongoing calamities. Like quit bothering me with this charade, we don&#39;t buy it, every single person involved in the selection looks like a buffoon, and just please rape and bend us the fuck over already thanks. Am I right? </p>

<p>Somewhat off topic, but who else here feels like our propaganda dispersement centers we call News networks really need to put pretty much basically any other fucking headline besides that one I see BLASTING across the screen all day long...&quot;Americas Choice&quot;... something about that is just so fucking insulting and absurd at this point. Like all this programming they&#39;re showing us so we can be informed to make a good decision when we go to vote (TROLOLOL HAHA). As we all know, CNN and the rest aim to have the people to be as stupid and uninformed as possible so there isn&#39;t a worse headline or motto they could use. </p>

<p>I swear to fucking sky daddy, if I turned on a random news channel and saw a presidential nominee speaking, running with the headline that and said &quot;A fire ant farted in Africa and 2014&quot;, it would be more relevant to what they are showing on the screen at this point. Telling me about an aunt that farted as outrageous as that is it&#39;s still probably more relevant to the content being shown than the insulting slap in the face of &quot;Americas CHOICE&quot;. That shit makes me so riled up that sometimes I will scream FUCK YOU out loud at the TV if I&#39;m on a rampage and happen to see it. WHAT FUCKING PART OF OUR ELECTION DO WE GET A CHOICE IN. PLEASE TELL ME. Because I know damn well they do not even let us pick one side or the other of the same coin anymore and let us think we have change, all get disappointed, and fall for it like clockwork every cycle. We have seen that at this point, they will just rig the fucking vote at the end of the day if they haven&#39;t controlled the narrative and brainwashed the population enough to make them think that they personally decided who they like....nope,  so now we the American people don&#39;t even get to pick between 2 options twice a decade. Can&#39;t really blame them though they have dumbed the majority down so fucking badly that happening to make a critical thinking decision twice every 10 years could cause mass hysteria. </p>

<p>I cannot even say land of the free, and home of the brave anymore in any positive light in my head and keep a straight face, we are anything but free and we sure as hell are not the home of any type of bravery anymore. Sad. </p>
