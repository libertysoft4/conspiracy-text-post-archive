Seriously, I&#39;m asking for someone to attempt to explain to me how a 30 year old person can think a thing like the quote above. Were they asleep during the last 5 primaries? Do they think a billionaire buying out the position of president is freedom? How delusional <em>are</em> some people? </p>

<p>How many hours of Fox News do you think that guy watches a day? </p>

<p>It just blows my mind that anyone thinks <em>either</em> side is working in the interest of the people of the USA, especially the Republican side. It&#39;s like they have amnesia about the last 30 years. It&#39;s just astounding. I really can&#39;t wrap my brain around people like this, how are these types of people so common? Is it just because Americans had it so good for so long that some of us got soft and lost our ability to think for ourselves? I just don&#39;t get it... I would seriously love to entertain some explanations as to how we got here as a culture.</p>

Once you come to realize that the whole &quot;political system&quot; is a complete charade it just gets more and more outlandish as time goes on.  When I see people like the one that you quoted it becomes apparent that we are quickly closing in on the age of idiocracy.   </p>

<p>Yes I completely agree.  That is the positive side of it.  Part of the population continues to fall for the increasingly retarded (for lack of a better word) political charade, but on the same note the numbers of people like us are increasing too (dramaticy though they try to marginalize that fact). The two sides will continue to become more and more polarized until something gives.</p>

Almost like a DEMOCRAT has infiltrated the party. But who was supporting Democrats a few years ago? </p>

<p>Who was considering running as a Republican 4 yrs ago but Romney was chosen to fuck it up?</p>

<p>Who has donated to Clinton regularly and other New York Liberals to participate in the very Crooked Crony Capitalism Practice (see what I did there?) we all hate?</p>

<p>Donald Drumph, friend of pedophile Epstein, Clintons, and other shady characters are now the friggan hope for our country? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, I agree with that statement.  The elite shit their pants this primary when Trump won.  He&#39;s not a puppet of the elite. Perhaps he may be co-opted in the future.

    <div class="md"><p>I also don&#39;t think trump winning was the establishment plan. Originally, the establishment was more concerned with making sure rand Paul&#39;s campaign never got a foothold and topics of discussion were limited to the typical Republican wedge issues.</p>

<p>If the establishment plan was for trump to win, there would be much more party unity right now. Old guard gop assholes like Mitch McConnell would be supporting him in a believable manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media coverage, it&#39;s been near-constant for trump while other candidates have been ignored. If you want a candidate to fail, you don&#39;t give them constant negative coverage, you give them NO coverage.

    <div class="md"><p>Whomever is running things placed two powerful pieces on the board.  One on the red side, the other on the blue side.  Ideally, the blue piece would be victorious, but in case past transgressions come to light and the blue side falters, the red side is still in the game.</p>

<p>The President of the United States of America is little more than a game piece there for show and comfort.</p>

<p>The real power hides behind the scenes, far from scrutiny, far from discovery, far from punishment.</p>

<p>Corporations rule all, and those who rule the corporations rule you.  It&#39;s so painfully simple it hurts.</p>

<p>This election is literally like watching some shitty reality tv not unlike honey boo boo or whatever other trash is on tv these days.</p>

<p>The best part about it all?</p>

<p>We sit here on the Internet and argue about whether or not ancient aliens created our civilization as we know it.  We fight about whether or not the world is round.  We fight about whether or not Trump is a Hillary player.  We fight about whether or not vaccines are helpful or harmful.  We fight about all of these details and much much much much more online.</p>

<p>No one has the balls to do anything about it (including me - what is there to even do?), and so we continue to live in this stupid farce of a world while we literally send children (if you think an 18 year old boy is not a child, you&#39;re a fool) to kill other people&#39;s children just so we can have bigger better TV&#39;s and more channels with nothing to actually watch.  We buy cheap shitty things from countries that literally use child slave labor to put our garbage together.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been convinced that life is a certain way, and we refuse to realize that we are all part of a system that is bigger and more amazing than anything we can ever imagine.  We are a part of a universe that is a part of a system that is literally incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The game is rigged, but worse?  The game is over.  You can&#39;t do a damn thing about it.  We&#39;re fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment made me think of my favorite political cartoon of all time: <a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/iAHofwAbVE4MmqpIx8sIQA_RTntosyljnYme_7Gez3g.jpg?w=1000&amp;amp;s=36f18a5a52a063d2c293d73abfce6252">https://i.redditmedia.com/iAHofwAbVE4MmqpIx8sIQA_RTntosyljnYme_7Gez3g.jpg?w=1000&amp;amp;s=36f18a5a52a063d2c293d73abfce6252</a></p>

<p>The reality is, the status quo will be maintained and things will get worse until they piss off enough people to do something about it. That&#39;s how wars start, then there&#39;s a revolution and the government briefly works in the interest of the people while the masses are paying attention, then slowing things begin deteriorating again but everyone has comfortable lives now so they stop paying attention to politics and the cycle repeats. Over and over and over. </p>

<p>There are incremental positive steps being made, but I think we&#39;re in one of those situations where we have to take a few steps back before we can start moving forward again.</p>

<p>Their games always fall apart. Their greed betrays them, and they push things too far. That&#39;s why there are revolutions all throughout history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt that way too. I think they underestimated Trump and failed to take enough vote rigging measures. They were planning to eliminate him early via media character assassination and slander. Bush was gonna float on his massive war chest while they played Carson as the Cain and Cruz as the Maverick. Rubio was to be a dark horse if needed. They got complacent.</p>

<p>The republican field was made as big as possible to ensure the chosen ones could sit aloof while the others battled it out. The democrat field was made as small as possible because everyone knew Hillary would have a difficult time. They knew election fraud was crucial for Hillary but thought they had the Republicans in the bag.</p>

<p>I watch the polls pretty closely for fraud, and there was a lot on the Dem side, I can tell you Hillary did not win legitimately. Republican side was within the margin of error but never in favor of Trump.</p>

<p>What this told me (and I was very surprised) was that voting still did matter. If you can overwhelm them with sheer turnout, they can&#39;t influence the results without being obvious.</p>

<p>It makes sense, they control the candidate selection and have been extremely good at rigging in the past. They don&#39;t really care who gets to the general, because they know they could work with them. Once they get the two, they have a little talk and decide who&#39;s gonna get the extra votes. The last two elections were almost flawless in execution.</p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t deny Trump from running because he has been such a big donor, but they sure were going to eliminate him from the field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a measured opinion, but I think they control Trump. It&#39;s all a show to give you the illusion of choice. Not everyone in the RNC is happy about it, and Trump probably has gotten more traction than many people expected, but I still think that this is designed for Hillary to win. The media is fluffing up the Trump support to make it look like a real 50/50 horserace, to keep everyone distracted from talking about how screwed we all are. It really doesn&#39;t matter who wins, the president doesn&#39;t control the destiny of the country anyway. The big banks and military companies run the government now, and increasingly have been for several decades. If Trump didn&#39;t sell out immediately to their billions they&#39;d offer him, then they&#39;ll get rid of him like JFK. Genuine rebellion against the military system is not allowed, and Trump looks to be easy to bring in to the fold. But he won&#39;t get elected, he is merely a foil for clinton. It&#39;ll be 51/49 clinton, and the tv will say &quot;ah, nice try guys, better luck next time&quot;. It&#39;s all rigged. Even if Trump wins, it&#39;s rigged. Pardon my cynicism, but I&#39;ve been around the block enough times to see what&#39;s coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As have I. I have the same concerns, but I think it&#39;s more likely that TPTB would threaten his family rather than try to buy him out. I don&#39;t think Trump can be bought very easily.</p>

<p>My thought is we needed an independently wealthy, stubborn, and pit bull of a man to beat the system <em>using</em> the system. Everyone else was virtually gaurunteed to sell out or give in.</p>

<p>All I have is hope at this point. Trump says everything I want him to say, and he doesn&#39;t need any money. I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s more concerned about his children living in a good country than anything else. If he&#39;s a faker, well we&#39;ve been fucked this entire time. Whatever the powers are/where planning for the next presidency is going to be bad, the culmination of decades. Every day I hope Trump means what he says and he isn&#39;t assassinated.</p>

<p>My point is he has the money. He&#39;s not some Rubio from Florida. He&#39;s also not a politician. He&#39;s been using politicians to get what he needs for years, he knows exactly how they operate.</p>

<p>I dispute him being a faker in general, I&#39;m sure he manipulates people to get what he wants in deals, but he&#39;s certainly not a Rubio, Cruz, or Clinton faker. If you have a specific example I&#39;d like to hear it, for my own enlightenment.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, but he would <em>never</em> lie to the public at large. Please. You&#39;re being naive. I know it sucks to lose hope, but realize you shouldn&#39;t be hoping in Trump or you will just be disappointed. Find hope in something else, something greater than this left vs right bullcrap the media has us convinced is important. Instead start to look for alternatives outside this paradigm that has been built for us to flounder around in. My 2 cents, we can agree to disagree. </p>

<p>Yes, I know there will be voter fraud. Massive voter fraud, the likes of which we&#39;ve never seen. They already pushed the envelope to the edge with the Dem primaries.

<p>It&#39;s a scam and it&#39;s the biggest scam going in politics right now because the people supporting him are the new Obamabots of &#39;08. &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; is the new &quot;Hope and Change&quot;.</p>

<p>The people running the show knew they needed an &quot;anti-establishment&quot; candidate this year to funnel all the opposition into, hence Trump.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, he&#39;s laid out some incredibly authoritarian policy during the primaries. Internet censorship, &quot;rebuilding&quot; the military, media censorship, bombing the families of terrorists, etc.</p>
