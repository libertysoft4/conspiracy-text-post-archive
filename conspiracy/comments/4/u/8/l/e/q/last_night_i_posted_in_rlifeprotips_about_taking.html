<p>Original text:</p>

<p>&quot;If you are like I was, eating nonstop fast food for convenience and price, don&#39;t do it any more. For over 30 years I ate fast food nonstop, as it became more and more popular over the 80&#39;s, 90&#39;s and 00&#39;s. Before, during and after work, I&#39;d hit a drive through. I got fat, unhealthy, lazy and miserable for a very long time.</p>

<p>Stop.</p>

<p>Go to the grocery store and start finding very easy recipes and MUCH cheaper food that IS NOT FROZEN, except for veggies. Stop drinking pure sugar like sodas and energy drinks, NO NEED. Avoid carbs, or keep them minimal, like breads and pastas. Eggs are NOT bad for you. A little actual quality cheese (not the processed slice crap) with your eggs, fine!</p>

<p>Tastes better (my god, when I try that pink slurry shit now, disgusting), you physically feel better which will get you to exercise more, and it&#39;s cheaper so you save tons of money.</p>

<p>No need to be a fanatic. I eat some ice cream, steak, boneless pork loins occasionally, see <a href="/r/GifRecipes">/r/GifRecipes</a> and <a href="/r/slowcooking">/r/slowcooking</a>. I started making my own veggie trays with salad dressing as a dip (buttermilk ranch, yum) with carrots, snap peas, broccoli, cauliflower, grape tomatoes, etc, eating more boneless, skinless breasts (on sale, $1.69-$1.99lb) pan fried in some oil with some awesome spices (creole Chacherie&#39;s (very inexpensive), and Lemon Pepper, yum!) often in salads with some awesome dressing like spicy honey mustard, and eating more fruits for my sugar addiction.</p>

<p>Right now, I&#39;m badly gorging on direct farm watermelons, yum. Still better than processed sugar. And, I eat nuts too. Full of fat, but good fat, and I don&#39;t overdo them. And, when you eat healthier you don&#39;t WANT to overdo your eating. That nonstop fast food, sugar craving for MORE AND MORE food goes away and your natural energy goes WAY up. Handful of nuts, almonds, cashews, peanuts, a handful of grapes, a banana, good stuff, and I get full and stay full easier.</p>

<p>I have some very simple recipes now to make things like an asian spicy garlic chicken that has a little sugar in the sauce, but the chicken and veggies are all good for me. Yum. Throw like 7 ingredients into a pan, some chicken breasts and wait 30-40 minutes, throw that over some microwaved frozen veggies, done.</p>

<p>To me, now, there&#39;s 3 levels of food. Good stuff like skinless chicken, raw veggies, fruits, bad food that I occasionally eat to keep me sane like red meat, ice cream, pizza, and horrific food that I never eat any more like fast food, dirt, and feces. No, I never ate dirt and feces, it&#39;s a joke. :)</p>

<p>(IF THIS POST GETS CENSORED OR BRIGADED IN ANY WAY BECAUSE OF THE NONSTOP MCDONALDS SHILL ADVERTISING ON REDDIT, I WILL ENRAGE AND I HOPE OTHERS DO TOO)</p>

<p>edit: changed overdue to overdo. lol&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta say, nothing conspiracy about what your advocating, it&#39;s simple common sense. I&#39;ve done the same as you and have never felt better. No extra sugar, no corn syrup, no diet sodas, only clean food and good meat.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t buy meat from the grocery store, it&#39;s been dyed red (beef) and pumped full of water and preservative (chicken). Only buy meat from a butcher, that way you can know it&#39;s not soaked in methylethyldeath #4.</p>

<p>Nuts are great, but beware of cashews, they can give you kidney stones. Brazil nuts are my favorite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason for the deletion must&#39;ve been for the mere fact that there&#39;s no better way of keeping people miserable - hence consuming even more or killing themselves directly or inderectly - than by feeding them absolute garbage by virtually hacking their tastebuds with chemicals, fat and sugar. </p>

<p>Just a few examples: if your miserable, like after a hard day&#39;s of work, you&#39;ll eat more. Too tired? Fucking fastfood. If you eat more, you&#39;ll need bigger clothes or find yourself on this rollercoaster between sizes, which is even worse. Once you&#39;re past this treshold of obesity you can&#39;t give a shit, let yourself go and start comfort eating. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll need special meds for a variety of ailments and will become over time an avid buyer or client of dietary bullshit, treatments, physicians, coaches, fitness gyms, antidepressants, plastic surgeons ... just to name a few. </p>

<p>My mother has been dieting for 40 years now, spent fortunes (literally) on all of the above and hasn&#39;t moved a leg with regards to sports or even fuckin&#39; walking. She&#39;s not obese, just meh, 15 kg overweight. I&#39;ve told and asked her a gazillion times to go out on the weekends to go hiking with the dogs, but she always has these childish excuses to never do any of it. She just spent 2500 bucks in 3 months on disgusting dietary garbage of which I can&#39;t even bear the smell when she&#39;s cooking that shit. Pure fucking rip-offs of dumb, lazy and miserable people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very true. Fast Food is actually getting fairly expensive to be honest. Paying that much for shit food when better is available at the Grocery store is pretty dumb. Hell my Grocery store cooks meals every day. Same price or cheaper but you get real food at least. And yeah Soda is poison. Almost as bad as Beer. Water should be your primary drink.</p>
