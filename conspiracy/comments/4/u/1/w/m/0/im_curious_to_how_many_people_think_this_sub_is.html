I want to ask the greater <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community if you think they&#39;re here. If they are, what stand do they take? Which side is right? We can all delve into an event and logically tear it apart. But when it comes to things like politics do you find certain people like to take more aggressive stances to their beliefs? I mean we&#39;re all here to discuss something in a skeptically logical way but then you find that one user that just says BS either explicitly or just in a confusing roundabout way. Are you talking to like minded people in certain threads or are you enhancing their rhetoric to blow shit out of proportion? Politics actively divides us, as we all know, yet let it separate us as we scroll through the threads.</p>

<p>This is just a mind jumble and wanted to express it. To good health everyone.</p>

Not an infestation more like kids that need to be exposed to the consequences of the shit they get paid to cover up. Maybe one will hear his conscience. But maybe the mind control combined with cult like uniformity is more than they can break through. I mean who wouldn&#39;t want to be a member of the Knights Templar,eagerly convincedthey are more human than any otherallknowingand walking with the one true creator for the betterment of humanity at any and all cost.....blah blah....cause this is how they get those and other jobs that a normal person would not be okay doing.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,maybe so, I think that the posts that i have seen he has made have been pretty much solid. So if they are all sponsored, they are chock full of information that can be verified and used. Kudos to him for finding a sponsor.

    <div class="md"><p>I love that you guys think I&#39;m so skillful that I must be some blackops psyops guy.  Here I was thinking I was johnny-come-lately to the scene.  Because i keep finding blogs of people who knew the stuff I&#39;m discovering (and presenting to you guys), like a decade or more ago.  It&#39;s kind of doublefacepalm stuff. </p>

<p>And things like you do all this digging only to find that the madonna lilly (the fleur de lis---like used in french heraldry...the martis gras lilly for example) is representative of a penis.  For real.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s about (it&#39;s also associated with isis i think, same with rose; lilly =&gt; lilith =&gt; isis).  The rose is a vagina and the lilly is a penis.  So all these kings and stuff are just infantile bastards putting high class dicks and pussies on everything.  I mean as a race of intelligent beings, we havent&#39; even gotten out of the public bathroom </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t.  I do this for free.  The reason I can do this all day is because I&#39;m out of work and on disability from a brain injury and hiv and other complications.  So I have very modest private income of a little over a grand a month, that I&#39;m paying myself back, which I&#39;ve done the fica math to find I&#39;ve paid for myself for 20 yrs so let&#39;s hope I last that long to get my money back.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, your taxes haven&#39;t paid for me yet.  And I even eschew medical for the most part and strangely, I&#39;m improving.  (I dont&#39; take hiv meds anymore, because I&#39;m allergic to them, but I take my supplement stack and my numbers are fine---the key is selenium, which i posted about previously)</p>

Picking apart everything you did (consensus cracking), doubtcasting, etc.  If you fix some spelling and get take longer than 3 minute you get a star, which they come back and say, &quot;oh look he edited it after&#39;, or if you delete, oh look they just deleted it, see?  they&#39;re bullshit  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subs has plenty of stuff going on. Shills. The good folk from Topminds. Trolls. Shitposters trying to discredit everything else.</p>

<p>Those are the obvious ones. Then you could safely assume that reddit itself (admins and/or a few of the mods) keep an eye on this sub. It goes without saying that the NSA (and whoever else) knows what is said here since they record every single keystroke on the internet. If some subscribers have &quot;legal issues&quot;, it&#39;s also a safe bet that various law enforcement agencies drop in for a visit from time to time to see what they&#39;ve been writing.</p>

<p>That last point comes closet to what I think of as infiltration. I&#39;m sure that there are some comments here aimed at egging people on, trying to get them to say something &quot;useful&quot;.</p>

I think they are here in r/conspiracy/ posting the dumbest shit possible to make all of us look bad. And when someone has a topic that is making great points they reply with comments that are so long and uninteresting and filled with links, that the person who is saying some truth gets ignored by readers.  9/11 &amp; NASA topics I notice this a lot.

    <div class="md"><p>I would quibble with your sentence -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But when it comes to things like politics do you find certain people like to take more aggressive stances to their beliefs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s really not about politics and beliefs per se, <em>it&#39;s about the money.</em></p>

<p>Money and power. Or wealth = power. More wealth more power. More wealth buys more political power.</p>

<p>The infiltration on reddit is not so much about politics as it it about reddit selling its influence to the people with the money who control the politics. And then when you&#39;ve been sold the politics, the laws and bureaucracies and regulations control you in every possible way. (mostly they steal your money)</p>

<p>Interestingly just this week reddit announced that self posts will now register karma points the same as link posts. It has been widely uncovered that reddit accounts are bought and sold on the underground and that karma points obtained in certain big subreddits - r/worldnews, r/news, etc. <strong>have more vote weight than karma points gained in lesser, more obscure subreddits.</strong> (<a href="/u/CANT_TRUST_HILLARY">/u/CANT_TRUST_HILLARY</a> illuminated here how that works awhile back)</p>

<p>So by allowing more redditors to gain more karma points with self posts, reddit has just monetized more user accounts to be bought and sold on the down low, and more accounts will have a higher karma vote weight enabling their votes to propel posts to the front pages in front of more eyeballs.</p>

<p>Monetization. Not politics. Reddit is all about the money, not about conversation or beliefs or political viewpoints or free speech. Politics is all about the money, not about conversation or beliefs or political viewpoints or free speech. </p>

<p>Forget politics. It&#39;s your wallet that they&#39;re all after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People really don&#39;t understand just how much money is in advertising. Faceless companies splash out stupid amounts of cash on ad pushes. And they do so willy-nilly. It&#39;s part of their yearly budget. Sometimes a big part. </p>

<p>Reddit itself casts a huge shadow on the internet. Advertisers know this. So of course they are spending money to get ad impressions on reddit. This in turn creates a cottage industry around catering to these advertisers. But it&#39;s not widely publicized because the entire allure of reddit to these big fish advertisers is that they get to push product on the masses <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EW8Bi1r.gif"><em>under the guise of being just another friendly redditor.</em></a></p>

<p>Once you realize that, reddit is fairly transparent. I only frequent a handful of subs these days, because whenever I go to the front page, it&#39;s clearly a battle between conglomerates trying to get noticed and opinion shaping by special interest groups. </p>

<p>For instance, one thing about reddit you can <strong>set your motherfucking watch to</strong> is the pro-cop post shortly after a shooting. </p>

<p>Like that &quot;Black cop White donut, White cop Black donut&quot; bullshit this morning. Get the fuck outta here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I logged into Reddit on my PC so it was basically r/all or r/frontpage the day after the NICE, France attack &amp; at the top of the page (1st post) which clearly said it was sponsored. The Post was titled something really decisive/ clearly trolling. It&#39;s was Oh on the party bus. Bump bump lol. Bouncing over kids lolololol. </p>

<p>It was very weird. It was posted in r/inthenews </p>

<p>Clearly I downvoted it. WTF</p>

<p>It made me think. What algorithm could do that. Anyways. Yes we are infiltrated but by software &amp; people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t realize how hard it is to break an actual new conspiracy on here.  I introduced a new conspiracy on here before. I posted it 3 times from 2 separate accounts and nobody seemed to care or comment.  I didn&#39;t know if it was because people were just uninterested in the topic (understandable since it wasn&#39;t a huge groundbreaking conspiracy) or if I was getting drowned out because of a flood of shit posts. I think it may have been a combo of both.  </p>

<p>But this showed me that only certain topics (Hilary, joos, the election etc) get any attention at all.  I guess my point is as much as we can blame the shills and whoever fog flooding this sub with worthless topics and disinformation, we are also partially responsible ourselves because we close our minds to more broad topics because we don&#39;t consider them relevant to our interests or we immediately think someone&#39;s topic as being uninteresting without getting any details.  </p>

<p>It makes me wonder if even as we fight these strange shadowy people/agencies, are their plans succeeding because we are fulfilling their desire for them with our own shortsightedness??</p>

<p>Tl;dr if a new proveable conspiracy came across this sub, nobody would notice and nobody has noticed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are real conspiracies in this world, but they aren&#39;t the ones that get upvoted in this sub. What the bots/sockpuppets do is downvote posts and comments <em>just enough</em> to get them ignored. They don&#39;t massively downvote the real revelations, because that would attract attention. It&#39;s the comments with 0 karma that nobody bothers to read. It&#39;s infuriating, to say the least. All these sockpuppets are complicit in activities that are going to lead to death on a massive scale, but they&#39;ll never take credit for it, will they? Because they&#39;re too stupid or weak to apprehend that they should have a guilty conscience.</p>
