<p>that&#39;s what I want to read. everyone knows Clinton is corrupt. we all know she is part of the bloodline and there is no change of here not getting in, no matter what her crimes were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember that the education system was ruined a long time ago. With that came a dumbing down of generation after generation, until you&#39;re left with what we have today, like Hillary supporters. Lol! But in all honesty I agree with you somewhat. Human nature is to conquer and destroy. However, at the same time, as has been taught from the beginning, with good must come evil. For without evil you wouldn&#39;t know what it means to be peaceful. Our problem is that we put systems in place where people have a certain power over others, and as we know power brings corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Russia release the emails if they did have them. Unless Trump &amp; Putin struck some kind of deal I would figure Russia would sit on the emails until Hillary is elected then blackmail the shit out of her. How much bigger would this have blown up if these were dropped sometime after she was elected?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Russia ever had them, they are just using it as an excuse from the fact they had a whistle blower in the DNC that sent these emails to Wikileaks and who was subsequently executed in DC for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is definitely in Russia&#39;s interest to keep Clinton out of the White House seeing as she was involved with the Ukrainian coup, has vilified and demonized Putin and has even stated publicly that she would threaten nuclear war with Russia and Iran.

    <div class="md"><p>The real reason.</p>

<p>People often times believe their President has the power to make all their problems go away or to create problems all by themselves. </p>

<p>If people really cared they&#39;d vote in local elections and run for office, but it&#39;s way easier to just freak the fuck out every four years, remind everyone they are fucked, and watch the suckers crash and burn.</p>

<p>People equate President with the future of America. If people truly understood how to guide the future of America they once again, would run for office and try to bring about change. If we continue on this current trajectory of mind looping fuckery, our country will continue to steadily decline in quality of living which may lead to a drop in education which would in turn diminish new discoveries that you desire. </p>

<p>Run for office, maybe if you do well enough, you can return to r/conspiracy one day and it not look like an unedited, uncensored r/politics </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The unfortunate truth is that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is one of the few places (of any sizable subscriber base) on reddit that <em>real</em>, uncensored, political information can be posted and not get deleted for contrived bullshit reasons by agenda-driven moderation staff. Almost everything that you can read and discuss here will get deleted immediately in  <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, even    though the stories are true.</p>

<p>The political content and discussion in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is what <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is <em>supposed</em> to be right now, especially with a major party political convention going on. </p>

<p>I for one am glad that some of this shit happening at  the DNC convention, that the MSM and big subs are suppressing through censorship, is being documented in this sub. It&#39;s important that it gets posted somewhere so it does not disappear down the memory hole of our short attention span society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Just feel a couple stories with multiple comments and good info would be better than the saturated front page we&#39;ve been seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem is that reddit is censoring the fuck out of what is happening at the convention, stuff that the MSM is not reporting on at all. People are trying to get the real information out in the &#39;main&#39; sections of reddit and it&#39;s getting deleted over and over again (hence <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>&#39;s main queue being mainly old 12+ hour posts spun as &#39;slow news day&#39;) and this sub is one of the only places the stuff is not getting deleted. The MSM is working overtime to paint a fake reality that everything is fine in the Democratic party. It&#39;s part of the illusion spinning TPTB cast upon the people. The real tragedy is how many people just believe it automatically. Trump fear and fake unity is the narrative to be cast upon the masses.</p>

<p>I  think  we will not be seeing the saturation as much once the convention is done.</p>
