    <div class="md"><p>No one family controls the world. Greed controls the world. People at the top can just do a lot more damage with their greed. Amsel Rothschild coined a famous phrase and him or one of his family members pulled off the waterloo switcheroo which through deception gained them control of a decent chunk of the bank of england. The bank of england would be the driving force behind what would eventually become the Federal Reserve. Lots of control. Yes. Controlling the world.. not quite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends on how you classify control though. Nearly all the countries in the world are subservient to the U.S and the U.S is subservient to the Rothschilds.

The US serves the Crown (as does Israel), the Crown serves Switzerland, and Switzerland serves the Vatican (Holy Roman Empire). Want to know the true bankers look into the Swiss (Templars) and the Black Nobility of Italy/Rome.

    <div class="md"><p>The Black nobility are ancient Papal/Roman families (also bankers). They are the elite&#39;s elite. They made their fortunes via The Vatican (Holy Roman Empire). Whether it was marriage or being Pope themselves. As with that family I liked to the other user here. </p>

<p>The Templars are some of the oldest bankers/knights of The Vatican. It is said they fled north to create Switzerland. Many think the two are at odds with each other, but IMO, that&#39;s a cover and has always been. There is a reason why the Pope&#39;s guards are Swiss (The Swiss Guard). I have a few posts I&#39;ve made about this topic, if you are interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People also fail to see, imo, is the US and the FED are in bed together.  THE Petro Dollar is the only thing US currency is backed by and without it, it would cause a major collapse.  It&#39;s coming, just isn&#39;t here yet.  The US needs it&#39;s currency backed by the PD.  The FED needs to keep printing and loaning out currency.  As long as the USD is backed by oil, the FED will keep printing more. </p>

I predict there are some links between the uk and usa but since usa is much stronger it cant be controlled by uk.

Also, what I&#39;m saying is, that it&#39;s very possible that the Roman Empire never fell and still rules via the Tri-Sovereign States (The Vatican (Holy Roman Empire), The City of London (The Crown/Banking), The District of Columbia (Military wing)). Another thing I highly suggest you look into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure. I haven&#39;t really looked into other aspects of all this. But there is a theory that Jesus was Caesarion, the son of Caesar, and that bloodline (Cleopatra/Marc Antony/Caesar) fled north to where the Druids &quot;were&quot;. It&#39;s also interesting, that that theory says that Caesarion fled (was taken) to India and that&#39;s where he was taught the ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Caesarion hypothesis is an interesting theory. Have you looked into Jesus being the &quot;Sun&quot; of God, being a myth carried down in the Age of Pisces along the lines of those in Hamlet&#39;s Mill? I myself must put in more investigation. Seems highly worthwhile.</p>

<p>To know if its the rothschilds(therefore zionisits) or the jesuits who control the world, one need only look. Expose after expose is done on the jesuits and are readily available online.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they have affected lots of banks in lots of countries, and have funded wars. It looks like they only fund wars, which is that the media says, but i predict they did, and are still doing, much more than that, secretly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People also fail to see, imo, is the US and the FED are in bed together.  THE Petro Dollar is the only thing US currency is backed by and without it, it would cause a major collapse.  It&#39;s coming, just isn&#39;t here yet.  The US needs it&#39;s currency backed by the PD.  The FED needs to keep printing and loaning out currency.  As long as the USD is backed by oil, the FED will keep printing more. </p>

<p>I do agree with your other comments. There are higher powers at play.  The world has always been at war over religion and it will cause the end.  </p>
