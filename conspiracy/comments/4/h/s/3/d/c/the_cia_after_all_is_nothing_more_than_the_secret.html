    <div class="md"><p>Spoken before Truman created the CIA, but applies to the CIA:</p>

<p>On War, by U.S General Smedley Butler (1933)</p>

<p>&quot;I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country&#39;s most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.</p>

<p>I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.</p>

<p>I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.</p>

<p>During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0970659105">Here</a> is the Amazon link (which only shows bookdealers). It&#39;s a Daniel Hopsicker book. Judging by the average asking prices this book would seem to be in high demand, yet it&#39;s relatively recent (2001). Add to this the many &quot;must-read&quot; recommendations I have read on various JFK/Deep State type forums, this sounds like a book no one should miss. [It even has a deliberate missing chapter...which apparently the author was forced to pull.]</p>

<p>Please DM me about this if it&#39;s easier! Thanks a lot!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Plus, just read the Amazon reviews (written when the book was in print). It is difficult not to see as peculiar that this book does not even have a limited low-volume annual printing...</p>

<p>Posted on r/TSBD:  Robert Morrow&#39;s stash of 29 books has some good JFK stuff...there&#39;s also a link to <em>THE SECRET TEAM</em> by L. Fletcher Prouty (1997 edition) on Page 2</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps not hosted/linked in Reddit (as I think there would be issues), but what do you think about a creating a library containing all of these types of books? I learn most of the reliable, high-quality info from these books (like <em>Family of Secrets</em> or <em>The Strength of the Wolf</em>), and many aren&#39;t out-of-print, and I&#39;d really like to get a like minded group together to contribute to create one central repository. </p>

<p>I think it would help spread information to more (uninitiated) people, because sadly, I think the internet gets &quot;scrubbed&quot; of the best info a little bit more every day... which leaves the lower quality info (long forum posts, etc,) which aren&#39;t always reliable. Does anyone have a server and a site? I do if we need one. We could keep it private, but offer some not behind any wall, and some which require a password to enter and browse...</p>

<p>By the way, <em>The Secret Team</em> (like all of Prouty&#39;s books) is excellent...very cool you have that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a website that had quite a few books available--but they lost a court case last year and the site was taken down.  The site had tons of 9/11 articles and books, too...(wish I had more 9/11 books)</p>

<p>archive.org has some books/videos/audio/articles...</p>

<p>there is also dropbox.com which allows users to share docs (someone shared a Stephen Kinzer link with TSBD)...</p>

<p>other than that--I was lucky to search and find some links before google changed their search functions over the last year or two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commend you for getting the books you did manage to get from (or through) Google. Good job. I am very frustrated by what I cannot find using Google anymore. I am considering using a private torrent tracker for ebooks.</p>

<p>Regarding what I&#39;m contemplating, I know it&#39;s <em>not</em> all above-board, but I believe nonetheless that knowledge should be set free.  I want to create (or find) a private site with links, or make it invite-only if necessary. I know for instance, that on many hacking forums (which aren&#39;t as politically sensitive), they have hundreds of gigabytes of documents, scanned books, or ebooks, available for members to download. But the page is not indexed by search engines.</p>

<p>As you point out, it&#39;s odd it isn&#39;t one that can be found... My suspicion is that there is a reason a scanned version of this book isn&#39;t widely available... And that&#39;s because links to it are being taken down for sketchy or unknown reasons.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my reasoning for a semi-private library. Knowledge is power, and the best of these books, whether out of print or not, will disappear if links are left up publicly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously really? Is it paperback? If it is a paperback (or even if not)...you wouldn&#39;t happen to be in the requisite &quot;knowledge is free&quot; state of mind that might compel you to scan it, would you? I ask because scanning typically requires removing the front cover.</p>

<p>If you scanned it using OCR software so it is actual text and not just a graphic image (which I could help with if need be). I would be happy to proof it and convert it to epub format (which would take some time, and be dependent on how many true graphic images are included in the book besides that body text), but I&#39;m pretty good at creating epubs.</p>

<p>If not, I understand. I just haven&#39;t ran into anyone else that owns it. I&#39;d buy it myself, but probably won&#39;t have the extra cash for another 6 months.</p>

<p>[And..I&#39;m dying to read this!]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unlikely.</p>

<p>The CIA is an <em>intelligence agency</em>. They are concerned with one thing; <em>power</em>. Any ties to businesses, money, or &quot;capitalism&quot; are merely to further their aims in &quot;soft&quot; ways - it&#39;s a lot nicer to be bribed than blackmailed (or assassinated), and the backlash is much lesser.</p>

<p>If Russia or China invaded the US today, and took over completely, lots of businessmen, politicians, and military officials would probably end up deposed/arrested. Most of the intelligence people, however, would not be. They would be absorbed, their records transferred over, and their loyalties bought with lenience. Remember - these are some of the most brilliant, most devious minds that our country has - there is no way that other countries would prefer to have them as enemies than as friends - even in a position where the CIA (and other intelligence agencies) no longer have the military to back them up. They are too useful. </p>

<p>How many SS agents were pardoned under Project Paperclip? How many KGB Agents were acquired after the fall of the Soviet Union in some project that won&#39;t be declassified for another fifty years? The former weren&#39;t motivated by Nazism, nor the latter by Communism. They were motivated by Power, pure and simple - which is why we felt <em>comfortable</em> taking these people in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CIA certainly uses blackmail as well as bribery--they have even worked with mafia to commit assassinations and other forms of malicious behavior.  CIA spread viruses to animals in Cuba, wouldn&#39;t think twice about bliwing up industrial facilities, bought elections in Italy, France, Japan...</p>

<p>As for the SS agents which were brought into the US under Paperclip--the American public was never aware these decisions were being made.  The taxpayers who funded the war, the soldiers who fought the war were NEVER told until decades later.  If they had been told--I&#39;m guessing CIA would have dealt with quite a bit of fucking backlash, possibly involving more oversight of their rampant criminality.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand how power works.  You have your analysis completely backwards.  The people who are really in power are the ownership class, the .01%, the people who control markets, production, trade, and currency.  The CIA work for them, they always have.  Controlling currency and labor systems <em>is</em> power, and the CIA are thugs to keep the real owners in control, nothing more. </p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t, because the CIA isn&#39;t mostly &quot;these people.&quot;  That is the end, power, control, and the system they have built to sustain it <em>is</em> the end game, and the CIA is integral to this as specialized jackboots. </p>

<p>All are ideological.  Ownership class is a perfectly descriptive word, especially when followed by the qualifiers I used.  They simply own much of what there is on the planet, and use force to ensure that if they don&#39;t directly down it they profit from it.  Controlling our ability to work and feed ourselves is a great way to control and they utilize it.  Ruling class, the Elite, and Ownership (as in means of production and large segments of the planet) class are synonymous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many very intelligent people in the CIA. However, given the way it was created (secret and compartmentalized), plus the likelihood that these very intelligent people were either already egocentric, narcissistic, or in the worst-case sociopathic, <em>and that these traits would have been selected for</em> in many cases.... The CIA is dangerous because of their absolute secrecy (even from Congress), and that many of the upper-echelon who have a large department or in charge of a large group of agents, can act on the whims of that senior individual. This results in rogue/not-rogue ops.</p>

<p>I mean everyone likes to say for instance that Iran-Contra, (and what Gary Webb reported) was &quot;rogue&quot;. But if the agency is structured in such a way to foster these types of objectives  without approval (due to secrecy), calling them rogue isn&#39;t actually accurate since the CIA isn&#39;t really one cohesive agency, nor is it expected to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0970659105">Here</a> is the Amazon link (which only shows bookdealers). It&#39;s a Daniel Hopsicker book. Judging by the average asking prices this book would seem to be in high demand, yet it&#39;s relatively recent (2001). Add to this the many &quot;must-read&quot; recommendations I have read on various JFK/Deep State type forums, this sounds like a book no one should miss. [It even has a deliberate missing chapter...which apparently the author was forced to pull.]</p>

<p>Please DM me about this if it&#39;s easier! Thanks a lot!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Plus, just read the Amazon reviews (written when the book was in print). It is difficult not to see as peculiar that this book does not even have a limited low-volume annual printing...</p>
