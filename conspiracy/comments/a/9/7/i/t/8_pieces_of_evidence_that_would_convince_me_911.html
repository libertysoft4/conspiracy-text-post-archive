        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is not to say that these things would necessarily exist, but that their existence would convince me. </p>

<p><strong>The existence of remote-controlled, Boeing 767 drones.</strong> 
These would have had to have been designed, tested and built. There should be photographs of the drones, test footage, and probably one or more prototypes. Where are the plans, engineering details, feasibility study results? </p>

<p><strong>Someone alive today who was supposedly on AA Flight 77 or any of the other flights.</strong> 
If a cruise missile hit The Pentagon, then the people who supposedly got on AA Flight 77 should still be alive today. There are ticket records and  Airline personnel records showing who was to be on that airplane, but if a missile hit The Pentagon where is the airplane and where are the people? The same could be said for the two that hit the Twin Towers. </p>

<p><strong>Video footage of a cruise missile hitting The Pentagon.</strong>
No video footage of the DC attack has been shown, but this would convince me. </p>

<p><strong>Audio or video of the President or his staff discussing the attacks.</strong>
While they could have not used the recording devices used for most Presidential meetings or it could be a lie that all the President’s communications are recorded, audio of any of the hundreds of hours of discussion and planning that would have had to go into such an operation would convince me. </p>

<p><strong>The wiring and demolition plans for the Twin Towers.</strong>
There had never yet been a controlled demolition on the scale of the Twin Towers. The tallest building destroyed by controlled demolition was the Hudson’s Department store in Detroit, MI at 439 ft tall, or roughly one third the size of the WTC. For that, a 21 man crew needed three months to investigate the complex and four months to complete preparations for the implosion design and a 12 person loading crew took twenty four days to place 4,118 separate charges in 1,100 locations on columns on nine levels of the complex. The WTC would have been several orders of magnitude more complex, so where are the structural studies, wiring plans and demolition plans? </p>

<p><strong>Video or photographs of the demolition work.</strong>
Surveillance  footage of trucks bringing in equipment, works hauling it up elevators, tearing out walls to get to support beams or workers installing demolition charges and wiring would convince me.</p>

<p><strong>Written military orders to launch a missile.</strong>
Whichever unit launched the missile at The Pentagon, the actual launch orders would have had to have proceeded down the chain of command from the President to the specialists who would actually press the launch button and monitor its flight. It is reasonable to think that a colonel, major, captain or lieutenant would want orders in writing before ordering his troops to launch an attack on an American, civilian target. </p>

<p><strong>Written operation plans or authorizations.</strong>
An operation this size would have required advanced, highly detailed planning. Someone would have had to order the construction of remote controlled dummy aircraft and authorized the money to build them. Someone would have had to authorize the purchase of the miles of detonation wire, detonators and explosive materials for the building. An operation on this scale should have produced thousands of pages of written plans and guidelines and copies would have had to have been distributed to the people involved in the planning, financing and execution. </p>

<p>As soon as I start seeing evidence like this, I might believe that 9/11 was an inside job orchestrated by the US Government. </p>

<p><strong>Quick Note</strong>
Did you guys miss the point? This the evidence that would convince ME. This is what I require. Me. Me. Me.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with anything else than what would convince me.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s pretty specific evidence. But again, until I see evidence of this caliber, I&#39;m not buying into any conspiracy. That is how evidence works. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and what I&#39;m asking for isn&#39;t even extraordinary. It&#39;s basic evidence.</p>

<p>No, these are not straw men or things that are &quot;impossible.&quot; These are pieces of evidence, that, if presented would convince me. That is it. That is all.</p>

<p>Until I see evidence of this type, however impossible, you will not convince me. Plainly and simply this is what would convince ME!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People in the truth movement are not spurred on so much by evidence of a conspiracy, but by the lack of evidence to back up the official story. I began to question the whole affair as soon as the video came in from Pennsylvania and I saw only a small crater and a complete lack of wreckage at the supposed crash scene. Indeed, there was wreckage, but it was strewn over several miles. There is no way to explain how the aircraft could have broken up in mid-air and left such wreckage that has never been seen at any other crash site. So I’m a skeptic and I will try to explain my own position on all of your questions.</p>

<ol>
<li> There has been work done by the US military in developing remote control for large aircraft and that has been confirmed by the military’s own documents. That such devices were used is speculation however. There are a lot of people who take great pains to invent explanations and then insist that those are reality. I like to stick to the facts and deal with those exclusively.</li>
<li> That is a sticky issue. Indeed, what happened to those people? We do have transcripts of cell-phone calls from aboard the aircraft but with the technology of the day those calls were impossible because signal loss took place above 1000 ft. None of the aircraft could have been below 1000ft at any time during their flights or they would have lost flight control. So we know that these records are impossible and that during the period following the time of hijacking until impact we can not account for the passengers.</li>
<li> Not only the Pentagon, but the whole of the area around it is under continuous video surveillance.  So, with so much record, why is it that only 5 frames of video were released, and that only after strong public demand? If the official story is accurate the powers-that-be should have been as eager for that footage to be shown as that of the aircraft hitting the towers.</li>
<li> I do not believe that GW Bush had anything to do with the whole affair. That is the principle behind deniability. It has been said that it would be impossible to keep such an affair secret given how many people had to be involved. To that I agree, if one supposes that all of those people are US citizens. I think it more likely that a small cabal in the US had knowledge, but that the vast majority are likely to be found in Saudi Arabia or other more secretive and oppressive countries.</li>
<li> This is, I think, the wrong question. A good operation does not leave documentation behind. And, just how good a job does someone need to do if the object is to fake a disaster rather than do a good job in which no one gets hurt and property damage is minimized?</li>
<li> Again, the wrong question but the right direction.</li>
<li> This is a supposition that it was a missile. Given the footage that was released, many people jumped to that conclusion. No investigation was done so we have no answer because we can’t ask the right question.</li>
<li> Saudi Arabia would be likely, as would Israel. Both have a special relationship with the arms industry so both are suspect.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once again, the problem we have is lack of evidence and an unwillingness to release what evidence there is. It should be noted that more money was spent investigating Bill Clinton, for an act that harmed no one, than was spent to investigate 9/11. That investigation was a fait accompli. </p>

<p>Planes are not very dense, and so break and scatter rather then make a big smoking hole.</p>

<p>Who says it broke up in mid-air?</p>

<p>Typically most crash sites are crash <em>landing</em> sites.  This one was possibly more of an uncontrolled descent, or a deliberate full throttle impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re-reading my comment I see where I generated confusion. And I&#39;m usually the one complaining about poor communication. Slap me.</p>

<p>Granted, the 757 is not a very large aircraft. But, we are asked to believe that this light aircraft, which has been proven capable of penetrating the steel exterior of the towers, would leave only a tiny crater. And if, as you said, it could have been a full throttle impact there is no way for me to buy that hole. </p>

<p>If it was a full throttle impact we should expect to see debris radiating out from the impact site. That is not to be seen. Instead we have a long trail of debis leading to the crater and very little beyond. On a day where so many atypical events occured this atypical crash is my smoking gun.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. I&#39;m hung over after yesterday&#39;s Grey Cup game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no expert, but steel exterior? not thin concrete and glass?</p>

<p>The outside of the building is almost certainly engineered to limit weight, and thus use non-dense materials, just like the plane, no?</p>

<p>Your point makes sense though, yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where it gets interesting. A standard construction uses a steel frame and the exterior is hung from that. Because of their hieght the Twin Towers had to be constructed very differently in order to give maximum strength while allowing maximum sway due to wind. </p>

<p>Each of the twin-towers can be thought of as being 2 seperate buildings. A central core of steel and concrete housed the stairs, elevators, ducting and other conduits. The exterior was a free-standing steel structure composed of prefab sections. Between these two structures were strung the steel floor joists. The joists had freedom of movement in order to allow for sway without pitching the floors up and down with every gust of wind. (I hope that this description makes sense). Where wieght was saved was in the floor joists. Most of the weight of the building went towards maintaining structural integrity rather than supporting floors. So, we are asked to believe that these lightweight floor joists could collapse and bring down the actual load-bearing structures. Even if the exterior had collapsed as we are asked to believe, the central core of the buildings should have remained standing. Those buildings had always behaved exactly as the designer had intended, until 9/11 when every built-in safeguard supposedly failed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what happened either way.  But a few things popped out that I don&#39;t understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a cruise missile hit The Pentagon, then the people who supposedly got on AA Flight 77 should still be alive today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  Why would they still be alive?  You&#39;d think if it was planned, they would have taken care of this.  </p>

<p>HAHAHA!!!  Could you imagine!  A plane hit the Pentagon.  Oh, by the way, the people on that were on that plane are all here.  Oops!  Our mistake.  Seriously?  This is your complaint?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wiring and demolition plans for the Twin Towers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you need this if you believe that the Twin Towers fell directly within its footing WITHOUT demolition charges?</p>

<p>Your complaint is self-contradictory.  It could have been a much simpler operation than you think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>tearing out walls to get to support beams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you even know how buildings are built?  There&#39;s no need to tear out walls.  Besides, every time a new company moves into an area, they move all the walls and everything else around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whichever unit launched the missile at The Pentagon, the actual launch orders would have had to have proceeded down the chain of command from the President to the specialists who would actually press the launch button and monitor its flight.</p>

<p>You want an act of treason to be on the books?  I don&#39;t understand this at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Written operation plans or authorizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one need authorization to buy anything.  You just go get it.  And if you want it bad enough, you can find it.</p>

<p>It did not fall &quot;directly within its footing&quot;, but it did fall mostly down. What a surprise, it fell down and not sideways.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, they need to tear out all of the protection around the support structures. Non-bearing walls are not relevant, of course those are easily moved. To take down buildings they need shaped charges right against the metal, not a few inches away.</p>

A building with a chunk the side of an exploded 757 taken out of it should fall towards the the missing section which is the weakest. Not directly down.

    <div class="md"><p>NP.  thanks for the note.  Your the first person that has thanked me in a very very long time.  It made my day!   I have a lot of questions about why no one was negligent even after blatantly lying to the commission and withholding information.  There is a whole investigation that will never take place because no one cares about who really fucked up.  No one blames the pentagon, no one blame the FBI or CIA.  It makes me depressed if I think about it.  We&#39;re happy about blaming terrorists or creating CD stories though.  :(   No one questions the billions we spend on keeping us &quot;safe&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit:  Ok people question it but I rarely hear about it.  I hate to use absolutes. </p>

<p>You brought up excellent points and in the same way don&#39;t refute me either. </p>

<p>You refer to my intuition and state some vague nonsense. I liked your comment about the &quot;lateral energy of the collision.&quot; If you are as knowledgeable as you sound then you would know that that energy was pretty much used up on impact and the fireball of the explosive aftermath. It would have long vanished by the time the tower came down well over an hour later. Just saying that puts you on a bad footing. </p>

<p>You&#39;re correct in saying the side is weak and you have to question the rigidity of all the surrounding floors as steel when heated to the temperature of burning jet fuel and all the other flammable office clutter does get soft. You also have to question the steel core on the side which the plane hit and was burning as well. The plane hit going roughly 450-500Km/h. That made it a projectile which would have penetrated to the core of the building. I think it even came out the other side a bit. </p>

<p>Steel when it gets hotter loses it&#39;s rigidity, (Also gets harder and more brittle the colder it gets FYI)  and becomes malleable and flexible. Physics and not just my intuition says that there should be a point where, due to the heating of the steel and it&#39;s loss of rigidity in a localized point, would tilt towards the weak spot and then &quot;let go&quot; especially with that large of a load weighing down upon it. Even if some of the plane had penetrated all the way through the larger point of the impact would still be a weak spot that would cause it to &quot;tilt over&quot;</p>

<p>My comment about the radio tower is relevant because it&#39;s a pretty tall straight structure that is mounted to the roof of the building. Before it vanishes into the smoke it tilts may a few degrees. Any sort of tilt of the upper sturcture&#39;s collapse would be indicated by it as it would act as a sort of protracter(sp?) yet it stays pretty vertical indicating it isn&#39;t falling over to the side as it would be expected.</p>

<p>If you are going to criticize then first understand the science, then understand the claim you criticize. Energy is not &quot;used up&quot;. Second, I did not claim that the lateral impact was significant, I said it was not. I listed it as one of several relevant factors to consider. When done you will see, as I said, that the energy from gravity pointing down overwhelms any of the other factors.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, that is just intuition. You need to model the full system to know what will happen. You are imagining the floor tilting and that somehow this should make the whole building tilt. But the tilt was not large, it was just enough to snap all of the joints holding the floor to the central core. Now the whole floor drops and hits the floor below. And the floor below is more rigid, so the stress is equalized rather than &quot;tilting&quot;. And then we drop to the floor below and now we have pretty much equal stress and the thing drops down.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t expect it to tilt all that much. It is not going to tilt any more than the floor below, it just may show it a bit more. But mostly what we have is things falling straight down because the force on them is gravity and the support joints have broken.</p>

<p>Is that above that pretty drop-ceiling in almost all modern office buildings there is no gypsum. You can see beams and columns directly. They should be sprayed with fire retardant, but that is easily chipped away. A broom, dustpan and vacuum is all that is needed to hide the evidence for a few days until <em>boom</em>.</p>

<p>I would never ask you to explain what happened on 9/11/01. Albeit amusing and imaginative, I don&#39;t have the time or patience to indulge in the full recollection of your thoughts on that day. I was merely pointing out that if you <em>do not</em> know what you are talking about, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be speaking so condescendingly to others about said subject. Like you did with the black boxes. Spouting something like it&#39;s fact, but obviously not checking your facts. In your reply there was just more of these same tired out arguments that are not true, really driving home my point about you being uninformed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re not here to jump through your hoops, asshat.</p>

<p>Not sure what you referring to. Again, I haven&#39;t asked you any questions, and don&#39;t remember requesting your personal opinion about anything, at any point in time. This isn&#39;t a debate or argument we are doing. You were posting bad information, it got upvoted, I felt the need to correct you, you replied back with a bunch of default truther talking points, and then I called you retarded. In this reply I am just reiterating the retardation... still not asking any questions.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you should start with reading about what <em>supposedly</em> happened that day and going from there. The  I would recommend rereading your truther sources, because you aren&#39;t even quoting those right. You seem to have no valuable information whatsoever, but just outdated talking points that you saw in a youtube video 5 years ago. Don&#39;t talk about investigation and mystery solving until you&#39;ve at least read some of the basics on both sides, or continue to look like a moron. It&#39;s people like you, PeterPandemic, Phazon, and many others that make the truther movement look retarded. I read the thoughts and posts here because I like to stay informed, and am a skeptic. When people compare all truthers and conspiracy theorists to the retarded crazy whack job stereotype, it&#39;s because of people like you. Stereotypes always have a little truth to them, and you are a perfect example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t owe you a fucking thing, and stop acting like I do</p>

<p>Get off your pedestal, haven&#39;t asked you for anything, and never would. I only replied to you in the first place because wrong information got upvoted 5 times. I stepped in to point out that it was wrong, and that was about it. Your name could be replaced with any other 50 white noise posters around here who just blindly comment on and upvote shit without even reading it.</p>

<p>TL;DR: You suck, read a book, done replying to you.</p>

<p>in other words, you won&#39;t find these things because they presuppose 9/11 was planned, orchestrated, and carried out by the American government.  the far more likely scenario, and the one supported by mountains of evidence, is that the government, with foreknowledge, consciously and purposely allowed 9/11 to be carried out by terrorist organizations so that they could capitalize on the terror it caused and justify their plans, long in the making, to occupy Afghanistan and Iraq.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this entire post just setting up multiple straw men, and then knocking them down to smear the 9/11 Truth people?</p>

<p>Serious researchers of 9/11 raise questions about the events and point at the gaping holes in the US gov&#39;ts &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; about the attacks -- they don&#39;t state that cruise missiles were used to attack the Pentagon or advocate the straw men set up in this post.</p>

<p>I really had to chuckle about wanting written plans and authorizations. Wow! We can&#39;t even get very much documentation that Bush lied his way into war against Iraq -- we have to rely on the British gov&#39;t for that. But somehow on this supposedly much more secret and much more dastardly conspiracy, there are supposed to be all this documentation lying around? What color is the sky in your world?</p>

<p>The active thermitc paper is a joke to everyone but truthers.</p>

<p>The other red flags are the fact that these samples have not been independently verified, and that the samples were literally scooped up by someone in the days following 9/11 from their windowsill.  The fundamentals of this research are tenuous at best.</p>

<p>That is the heart of your problem right there.  People who understand physics far better than you do not support your ideas, and have no trouble accepting the &#39;official story&#39;.</p>

<p>The fact you can not envision an alternate scenario or even speculate as to one I think says a lot.  The real reason you&#39;re not going to forward a hypothesis is because you know other have tried and been laughed out of the room.  (Typically because estimates of people involved get into the thousands) The new marching orders for truthers is not to answer questions about your theory, (or give specifics, or even mention an alternate theory) but to deviate and re frame the issue.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you this the official story of 9/11 requires about 30 people and about 1 million dollars, period.  How many does yours require?</p>

<p>This is never going to happen, unless a criteria similar to the OP;s is ever met.  At this point the new investigation cry is the TM&#39;s bumper sticker slogan.  I would have loved to have NYCANN succeed and have thruthers have their theories cross examined, it would have been on of the most entertaining things ever.</p>

<p>I understand you have no theory, but your posts betray you.  You appear to think thermite was used to demo the towers...that&#39;s one theory.  You think flight 77 didn&#39;t hit the pentagon.  That&#39;s two theories.  So why is it such a stretch to try and speculate as to what would be logistically required in these two instances?  If these are things that you believe over the official story then construct a narrative with the available evidence and go from there.  Trust me, I&#39;ve seen many try to concoct an alternate time line/scenario; they all become hideously complex and end up involving innumerable people, in both execution and subsequent cover up.   Like I said before the official story, 30 people 1 million dollars.  The average truther theory 5000+ people, trillions of dollars and constantly growing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets conservatively estimate 1000 perpetrators (demo crews, media plants, high profile politicians, intelligence officers, foreign nationals etc).  How much would be paid in &#39;hush money&#39; alone?  1 million per person, 2,5,10 million?  Keep in mind these are people who one would assume are already realitivly wealthy, so there would have to be some sort of incentive.  Then consider the operational budget, tens of thousands of lbs of explosives (if one supposes nano thermite it has been estimated at thousands of $ per lb to produce),  new undetectable detonation mechanisms, media campaigns of disinfo, ongoing information suppression, monitoring of people who know the truth etc.  I say trillions because its pretty common around here for people to talk about Cheney&#39;s mission 2.3 trillion in the same breath as financing 9/11, and when you look at how far reaching the conspiracy would have to go, the money starts adding up pretty quick.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you even know how buildings are built?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that above that pretty drop-ceiling in almost all modern office buildings there is no gypsum. You can see beams and columns directly. They should be sprayed with fire retardant, but that is easily chipped away. A broom, dustpan and vacuum is all that is needed to hide the evidence for a few days until <em>boom</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go out buy the game Jenga. Build yourself a little tower. Pull out a block and then blow gently on the opposite side to simulate wind. Note which way it sways and falls over? Sideways.<br/>
A building with a chunk the side of an exploded 757 taken out of it should fall towards the the missing section which is the weakest. Not directly down. If you watch the video of the second collapse the radio tower thingy ontop stays vertical the whole way down until it&#39;s lost in the smoke. </p>
