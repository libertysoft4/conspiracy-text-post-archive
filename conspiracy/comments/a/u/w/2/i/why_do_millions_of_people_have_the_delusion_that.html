    <div class="md"><p>WOW.  Way to make this an attack on religion.  Responsible faith doesn&#39;t ignore reality or pawn off responsibility on imaginary creatures.  The tendency to do that is a human flaw, not in inherent downfall of faith in general - many people with religious faith have also accomplished amazing feats of generosity and achievement.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather say that we as a society have become so accustomed to  handouts and easy wealth that it&#39;s easier to eat our Cheetos in front of American Idol and assume our government is gonna make it all better than to take responsibility for our own laziness.  The brainwashing involved here is not restricted to religion - and making such a limp attempt to divert the blame is more likely to add to the mess, thank you very much.</p>

<p>I think you should rephrase these types of sentences, and not use words that imply forceful changing of someone&#39;s thoughts. That&#39;s wrong.. Rather you should try to show that it&#39;s people&#39;s willful ignorance and misinformation that are the cause, which is both accurate and not unnecessarily alarmist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like to believe in &quot;saviors&quot; cause it&#39;s been brainwashed into them at birth.  They think some white knight will come out of the woodwork, spend a day and his valuable time and come save people he doesn&#39;t know who are part of the problem till they become part of the solution.</p>

<p>People fail to realize that no one will save them.  People must save themselves.  Yes, believe it or not, you have to be your own Jesus.  The dumbest of the dumb will call this blasphemy cause you just might be considering yourself god or God[which is quite absurd anyways].  Either way, no mythical creature sitting in the sky who noticed the tire marks on your soiled skivvies is going to break sweat over you or the masses.  </p>

<p>So these idiots will sit idly by, as life passes them by, they will sit and cry, and still ask why, but will they ever try...?</p>

<p>If there was a god, he&#39;d be disgusted by the compliance and the lack of self respect people have that collectively give them the shit hole that they live in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much deeper than this, but I think I&#39;ll just leave it shallow and short and get the usual flames, but at the end of the day most of us know what must be done.  Fear is a great ally to have though...</p>
