    <div class="md"><p>I am a climate change expert, I have <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/9y1l1/i_have_worked_for_geoscience_australia_land_and/">worked extensively with climate change scientists</a>. I am downloading this information to read through it myself, I will post here with my findings. </p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>For a balanced perspective I would very strongly suggest you read <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/the-cru-hack/#more-1853">RealClimate&#39;s response</a> to this matter. </p>

<p><strong>edit 2:</strong> </p>

<p>I have been sifting through the files, but with 4,500+ files, including thousands of emails spanning 13 years, large word documents, pdfs and even what appear to be raw database files, this is not going to be an easy task, I imagine it will be months before we have a clear picture of what is contained in this leak. </p>

<p><strong>edit 3:</strong> </p>

<p>Most of the emails contain nothing of real value; some of them are out of office replies and social correspondences. But then some of them contain the raw data used for the IPCC millennium predictions, it is the leaking of this data that will very likely have the largest scientific value in this leak. As far as dispute about climate science goes, most of what I am seeing is legitimate scientific questions of specific data points and methodologies, I haven’t found any large scale attempt to influence the end results. I will continue looking into this. </p>

<p><strong>edit 4:</strong></p>

<p>It is <em>possible</em> this particular organization <em>may be</em> guilty of <em>some</em> misconduct, I do not have sufficient proof at this point, none of us do, but given the tone and content of some of the emails I would support further enquiry. However, even if that were the case, it would not indicate a global conspiracy, it would only indicate a small group of self interested individuals attempting to ensure funding at the expense of their integrity. The reality is that none of these alleged attempts to undermine the peer review process or stop certain papers from being published, if that is what they were, ever succeeded. </p>

<p>The data itself does not contradict global warming, at best there are anomalous data points or methodologies that may need readjusting, there may even be additional datasets to consider, but <em>none of this is a scientific disproval of the overwhelming body of evidence.</em> </p>

<p>I am no corporate shill, yes climate change funding has paid my wages in the past, but I quite honestly wish it didn&#39;t have to, if I could do anything to make climate change not be real, believe me I would. I welcome any good news!  I am not trying to keep my job, I would be far happier if there didn&#39;t have to be climate change experts, <em>I would much rather have a world to retire to than a retirement fund in a ravaged world.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of things of interest in the emails.</p>

<p>&quot;The fact that satellite and weather balloon measurements in the lower troposphere <strong>do not show a warming for the past 21 years</strong> suggests strongly that the surface data are influenced by proximity to human habitation, rather than by greenhouse warming&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our global Carbon Cycle Model reveals a half-life time of only 38 years for any CO2 excess. With present constant global CO2 emission until 2100, the temperature would only further increase by 0.15 °C. Scenario IS92a would end up with 571 ppm only. IPCC assumed that far more fossil reserves would be burnt than being available. Using a flawed eddy diffusion ocean model, the IPCC has grossly underestimated the future oceanic CO2 uptake. Hardly coping with biomass response, limited fossil reserves and using a factor 4 temperature sensitivity, all this leads to an IPCC exaggeration factor of about 6 in yr 2100. The usable fossil reserves of 1300 GtC burnt by 2090, merely cause 548 ppm – not even a doubling. The WRE 650, 750 and 1000 ppm scenarios, projected until 2300, are infeasible. <strong>Emission reduction is absolutely useless: the realistic temperature effect of Kyoto till 2050 will be only 0.02 °C</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This individual review paper focuses on IPCC&#39;s three most essential modelling and core parameter errors. The impacts on all modelling results would be so tremendous that if the TAR would be corrected for these errors, there would hardly be any more justification for it. So this paper addresses only few individual TAR fallacies, but focuses on the <strong>nondisclosed flawed science it is</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was good to see you again yesterday - if briefly. One particular thing you said - and we agreed - was about <strong>the IPCC reports and the broader climate negotiations were working to the globalisation agenda driven by organisations like the WTO</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for Keith’s <strong>to hide the decline</strong>. Mike’s series got the annual land and marine values while the other two got April-Sept for NH land N of 20N. The latter two are real for 1999, while the estimate for 1999 for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90. The Global estimate for 1999 with data through Oct is +0.35C cf. 0.57 for 1998.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>surface data are influenced by proximity to human habitation, rather than by greenhouse warming&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely, there is a lot of evidence for city heat bubbles and landscape alteration resulting in changes in the local climate. It does not however have to be only one or the other, the two processes feed off and exacerbate each other. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Emission reduction is absolutely useless: the realistic temperature effect of Kyoto till 2050 will be only 0.02 °C.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is not new, there is a lag in the effect of CO2 on temperatures of about fifty years. Emission cuts will have almost no effect on the next fifty years, cuts now effect the fifty years after that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the IPCC reports and the broader climate negotiations were working to the globalization agenda driven by organisations like the WTO.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet again, not new. Given any climate cuts have to be global, and that we have no global government, trade is the global method chosen to try and establish a global solution, of course the WTO is implicetly involved in those global trade negotiations.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>to hide the decline. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, do you actually know what they are talking about? What is declining here? What is the series they are talking about? Have you considered that in combining various different methodologies there may be circumstances in which you may need to overlay the warming trend of one dataset over the warming trend of another dataset? I am sorry, this is not the admission of guilt you intend it to be. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Realclimate.org was named in some emails as being part of the fraud and has now gone into damage control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I offered their response to provide a balanced view, I believe it is called the right of reply. </p>

<p>listen, I will level with you. As a climate science organization you have two jobs, collecting the data and then conveying that information to allow for meaningful outcomes. In a prevailing climate of fiscal and social conservatism it is very difficult to convince everyone that what you are saying is actually the case. This makes the second part of your job particularly difficult. To this end you quite often have to approach from another direction, either softening the blow or stressing the case. On the international stage it was decided (rightly or wrongly) that the message had to be watered down to gain universal acceptance, this is what the IPCC and Kyoto do. Their entire function is to be an easier pill to swallow, trying to get conservatives on side by giving them small targets and then gradually increasing the targets. So yes, the IPCC does not reflect reality, it never has, and kyoto is largely useless, indeed carbon taxes work the same way. They are a way of getting the frog in the pot so you can gradually turn up the heat. </p>

<p>I wish it didn&#39;t work this way, just like I wish the banks didn&#39;t heartlessly rule everything in the pursuit of profit, but the reality is, if you want to actually achieve anything you often need to make compromises and work within the flawed system you are given. Unfortunately this often looks like you are in collusion with the powers that be, that is because you are, you have to be. If the world is ruled by someone, you can&#39;t change the world without working with the guys in charge, that doesn&#39;t automatically make your cause part of their original plan. Yes, those bastards will find some way of working it into their plan, they&#39;ll find some way of making money off anything, but that is better than doing nothing. </p>

<p>Things are not going well, for whatever reason, the climate is changing more than it ever has before. We have put our best minds on the job of figuring out how bad it will get, and the answer almost universally comes back &quot;bad to horrible&quot;, none of us want this to be true, some people go into denial, some people get angry, some people look for any proof to the contrary they can find. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t convince you of anything, only you can do that. If I can help at all, let me know.</p>

<p>Indeed, well put. </p>

<p>The conspiracy theorists are suspicious that the environmental movement has been co-opted by globalists who have the ultimate aim of establishing a One World Government.</p>

<p>That is not to say that global warming/cooling, pollution, emissions, logging, CFC&#39;s and desertification are not real, or that environmentalism isn&#39;t important and necessary. That is not really the argument. The conspiracy theorists argue that these genuine concerns have been used as a political tool by &quot;The Conspiracy&quot; to divide and conquer, fearmonger, and to further their global government agenda.</p>

<p>The Club of Rome, a globalist think tank, published documents in the 1970&#39;s that suggested that for a world government to be established, a global enemy must be found. And they concluded that the ideal global enemy is mankind itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Members of the Club of Rome include Al Gore, Ted Turner, Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, David Rockefeller and Bill Clinton.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html">http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html</a></p>

<p>Given their stated agenda to politicize the issues of mankind&#39;s impact on the environment to further global governance... we have a right to be skeptical of the propaganda surrounding these issues.</p>

<p>&quot;A radical change from the current trajectory is required, a complete reordering of global society...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At this time a new enemy must be found, one either real or invented for the purpose...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Democracy has failed us, a new system of global governance, based on environmental imperatives, must be implemented quickly...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolutely have every right to be skeptical of everything that is told to you, and I honestly would not even be surprised if that plan was indeed the case. However, I am not an expert in secret global government cabals, I am an expert in climate change. </p>

<p>Whether they exploit it or not, things are getting bad, and it is abundantly clear, even just from chopping down forests, that humans are responsible for changing the climate. If we do not take drastic preventative and preparative actions, we are going to be in serious trouble.</p>

<p>These leaked documents do nothing to contradict that. If you want to debate the plans we should use or the actions we should take, that is great, that is the discussion we need to be having, that is how we stop corporate interests from dominating the solutions. But continuing to question what is as blatantly and immediately obvious as millions of acres of desert that was once farmland, debating whether humans change our climate, does nothing to help any of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fair balanced reply........... let us know when you get through the emails, love to hear your conclusions.</p>

<p>The thing people don&#39;t like about the debate is the fact they just want to use taxation as a solution, should the solution be based on removing the coal and oil industries, as hard as that may be they have to go, and at the same time corporations are wiping out thousands of acres daily of co2 breathing rainforest, seams hypocritical to most</p>

<p>Science is based on evidence, while religion is based on shit that&#39;s totally made up.  At present, most of what people &quot;know&quot; is in the category of &quot;religion,&quot; and incidentally &quot;what they are told from TV,&quot; but this is only a rule of thumb, not a conclusive proof, that a popularly held belief is wrong.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I see in this thread is a bunch of idiots spouting off about how this apparently disproves the mountains of evidence that support global warming.</p>

<p>I tried mentioning not to commit the &quot;fallacy fallacy&quot; and got downvoted, called a religious fanatic, in denial, and unable to think for 10 seconds for it, in this very post. Then called childish - this place is a real bastion of reason.</p>

<p>You guys aren&#39;t looking to have a rational conversation here, you&#39;re taking everyone who is looking at this and asking if this really suggests global warming is a complete hoax and ganging up on them in a huge pile of bigoted bullshit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you came here because this story does interest you, but you&#39;re not interested in hearing a bunch of dumbasses who seem convinced this means global warming is entirely a complete hoax, head over to the submission in another reddit that gives a more rational response to this unfortunate revelation of the questionably sketchy tactics of a few scientists:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/a6i5g/breaking_hadley_cru_emails_hacked_they_show_an/">http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/a6i5g/breaking_hadley_cru_emails_hacked_they_show_an/</a></p>

<p>-OR-</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a6kcb/">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a6kcb/</a></p>

<p>Or just downvote this post in complete ignorance because you now have reason to rationalize why you think everyone who thinks global warming is a problem is a religious nutcase (???), and you&#39;d rather silence somebody for questioning your rash conclusions all while criticizing them for not liking to be questioned, I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>(P.S. Actually, try to upvote this, so people can see it and be redirected to the other link, as what I&#39;m saying is pissing a lot of these guys off and they&#39;re downvoting it thusly).</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Now on to the Club of Rome.</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Alexander King</strong>
Co-Founder of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>,
(premier environmental think-tank and
consultants to the United Nations)
from his 1991 book The First Global Revolution</li>
</ul>

<p><em>&quot;We need to get some broad based support,
to capture the public&#39;s imagination...
So we have to offer up scary scenarios,
make simplified, dramatic statements
and make little mention of any doubts...
Each of us has to decide what the right balance
is between being effective and being honest.&quot;</em></p>

<li>Prof. <strong>Stephen Schneider</strong>,

Professor Schneider was among the earliest and 
most vocal proponents of man-made global warming 
and a lead author of many IPCC reports. 
He is a member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><em>&quot;Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse?
Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?”</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;[The Earth Summit will play an important role in] reforming and strengthening
the United Nations as the centerpiece of the emerging system of democratic global governance.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;The concept of national sovereignty has been an immutable, indeed sacred, principle
of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly
to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation. It is simply not feasible
for sovereignty to be exercised unilaterally by individual nation states, however powerful.
The global community must be assured of environmental security.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Maurice Strong</strong>,
Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
Al Gore&#39;s mentor and executive member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>.</li>

<p><em>&quot;I believe it is appropriate to have an &#39;over-representation&#39; of the facts
on how dangerous it is, as a predicate for opening up the audience.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Al Gore</strong>,
member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong> and set to become
the world&#39;s first carbon billionaire. He is also the largest shareholder
of Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), which looks set to become the world&#39;s central
carbon trading body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maurice Strong sits on the board of directors for CCX.</p>

<p>Back before he became U.S. President Obama served on the board of directors
for the Joyce Foundation when it gave CCX nearly $1.1 million in two separate
grants that were instrumental in developing and launching the privately-owned
Chicago Climate Exchange, which now calls itself “North America’s only
cap and trade system for all six greenhouse gases, with global affiliates and projects worldwide.”</p>

<p>Essentially Obama helped fund the profiteers of the carbon taxation program
that he then steered steered through Congress.</p>

Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors
have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion
for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop
our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity
during those years. But, the world is now much more sophisticated and
prepared to march towards a world government.
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers
is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>David Rockefeller</strong>, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991.</li>

<p><em>&quot;Some even believe we (the Rockefeller family) are part of a secret cabal

and the cancer is Man.&quot;</em></p>

500 million but less than one billion.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Club of Rome</strong>, Goals for Mankind, 1976.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>&quot;A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells;
the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people….
We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms
 to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many
 apparently brutal and heartless decisions.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Paul Ehrlich</strong> in The Population Bomb. Paul Ehrlich is a member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>.</li>

<p><em>&quot;I believe that human overpopulation is the fundamental problem on Earth Today”</em></p>

<p><em>“We humans have become a disease, the Humanpox.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dave Foreman</strong>, Co-founder of Earth First! and member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“World population needs to be decreased by 50%”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Henry Kissinger</strong>, , Former National Security Advisor, Former Secretary of State, 
chairman of Kissinger Associates, member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“We must speak more clearly about sexuality, contraception, about abortion,
about values that control population, because the ecological crisis, in short,
is the population crisis. Cut the population by 90% and there aren’t enough
people left to do a great deal of ecological damage.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, Former President of the Soviet Union,
member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>“A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ted Turner</strong>, founder of CNN and major UN donor, member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it is just as bad not to say it.</em></p>

<p>Dear Ray, Mike and Malcolm,</p>

<p>Once Tim’s got a diagram here we’ll send that either later today or</p>

<p>first thing tomorrow.
<strong>I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps
to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from
1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.</strong>  Mike’s series got the annual
land and marine values while the other two got April-Sept for NH land
N of 20N. The latter two are real for 1999, while the estimate for 1999
for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90. The Global estimate for 1999 with
data through Oct is +0.35C cf. 0.57 for 1998.
Thanks for the comments, Ray.</p>

<p>Cheers
Phil</p>

<p>More interesting is what is not contained in the emails. There is no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy, no mention of George Soros nefariously funding climate research, no grand plan to ‘get rid of the MWP’, no admission that global warming is a hoax, no evidence of the falsifying of data, and no ‘marching orders’ from our socialist/communist/vegetarian overlords. The truly paranoid will put this down to the hackers also being in on the plot though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not an explanation, it&#39;s an attempt at damage-control.  I can see for myself what the emails do and do not contain.</p>

<p>There <em>IS</em> evidence of the falsifying of data.  Very very strong evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explanation is further down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No doubt, instances of cherry-picked and poorly-worded “gotcha” phrases will be pulled out of context. One example is worth mentioning quickly. Phil Jones in discussing the presentation of temperature reconstructions stated that “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.” The paper in question is the Mann, Bradley and Hughes (1998) Nature paper on the original multiproxy temperature reconstruction, and the ‘trick’ is just to plot the instrumental records along with reconstruction so that the context of the recent warming is clear. Scientists often use the term “trick” to refer to a “a good way to deal with a problem”, rather than something that is “secret”, and so there is nothing problematic in this at all. As for the ‘decline’, it is well known that Keith Briffa’s maximum latewood tree ring density proxy diverges from the temperature records after 1960 (this is more commonly known as the “divergence problem”–see e.g. the recent discussion in this paper) and has been discussed in the literature since Briffa et al in Nature in 1998 (Nature, 391, 678-682). Those authors have always recommend not using the post 1960 part of their reconstruction, and so while ‘hiding’ is probably a poor choice of words (since it is ‘hidden’ in plain sight), not using the data in the plot is completely appropriate, as is further research to understand why this happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. My claim was too strong. Nevertheless, they acknowledge specifically a number of emails which they know to be valid and unmodified (like the first one they sent out) and they made no claims that any of the emails they saw were tampered with. So, while there is certainly a possibility that some of the emails were modified, statistically speaking I think we can safely say (as long as we assume that they can verify incorrectness ~ as easily as correctness (which appears to me to be logical, since any modifications would have to be about as easy to spot as correctness (since to know correctness you must have records for that sender / recipient which means that if there&#39;s anything for that sender / recipient that is incorrect, you can spot it))) that judging by their sample, they have strong evidence that the majority of the emails are unmodified.</p>

If you a graph showing the number of cheeseburgers sold over the past tne years, and a graph showing the number of hamburgers sold over the same period, producing a graph which combines the two, to whow the total number of hamburgers sold, is data manipulation, but it is not falsification. </p>

<p>In a confdential informal internal email it is possible they were using terms very loosely or with a specific meaning.

<p>Climatologists Baffled by Global Warming Time-Out</p>

<p>&quot;It cannot be denied that this is one of the hottest issues in the scientific community,&quot; says Jochem Marotzke, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. &quot;We don&#39;t really know why this stagnation is taking place at this point.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The IPCC claims that more than 2,500 respected scientists and policy makers collaborate to write its climate change assessments but less than a tenth of these ‘experts’ actually hold qualifications in climatology, most were in fact educated in the political and social sciences. The panel that edits and approves the reports are appointed by the United Nations, and more than half are actually UN officials. Dr Richard Lindzen, who is a genuine climate expert, resigned from the IPCC process after his contributions were completely rewritten by the panel.</p>

<p><em>&quot;It&#39;s not 2,500 people offering their consensus, I participated in that. Each person who is an author writes one or two pages in conjunction with someone else. They travel around the world several times a year for several years to write it and the summary for policymakers has the input of a handful of scientists, but ultimately, it is written by representatives of governments, and of environmental organizations, each pushing their own agenda.&quot;</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>MIT&#39;s Professor of Atmospheric Science Dr. Richard Lindzen on the IPCC report. </li>
</ul>

<p>Dr Chris Landsea resigned from the IPCC because he <em>“personally could not in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound.”</em></p>

<p>Czech President Klaus stated <em>“It is not fair to refer to the UN panel as a group of scientists. The IPCC is not a scientific institution. It&#39;s a political body, a sort of non-government organization of green flavour. It&#39;s neither a forum of neutral scientists nor a balanced group of scientists. These people are politicized scientists, and UN bureaucrats, who arrive there with a one-sided opinion and a one-sided assignment.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Many renowned climatologists strongly disagree with the IPCC’s conclusions about the cause and potential magnitude of Global Warming. More than 20,000 scientists have now signed the Oregon Petition which criticises it as ‘flawed’ research and states that <em>“any human contribution to climate change has not yet been demonstrated.”</em></p>

<p>he Global Warming Petition Project has been signed by more than 31,000 American scientists, including more than 9,000 with PhDs. Signers include world renowned physicists such as Prof. Edward Teller and Prof. Freeman Dyson. Nearly 4,000 signers are scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth and the past and current phenomena that affect that environment. </p>

<p>The petition states: <em>“There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth&#39;s climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.”</em></p>

<p>Proclaiming that <em>“climate change is real”</em> is a nonsensical statement and ignores the Earth’s continual natural warming and cooling cycles. Vikings settled in Greenland and raised crops and cattle 1000 years ago, while Britons grew grapes in England. Four hundred years later, Greenland froze and the Vikings starved. Europe was gripped in a Little Ice Age. The Thames froze all the way up to London. Another surge in temperatures saw widespread global droughts in the mid-1600s. Temperatures plunged again around 1700’s. The globe warmed in 1800-1940, cooled for the next 35 years, then warmed again. The 1940-1975 cooling period occurred despite the fact that industrial production and release of CO2 vastly accelerated during this time. This led to political and media scaremongering about Global Cooling, and the threat of a new ice age. </p>

<p>Again, this arose out of a misunderstanding of long term temperature fluctuations. Scientists have discovered that the sun not only has a regular 11 year cycle of sunspot activity. They have now discovered a significant 200 year cycle. Sunspot and solar radiation activity almost exactly parallel temperature changes on the Earth. It correlates well with the anomalous post-war temperature dip, when global carbon dioxide levels were rising very fast. The increase in solar radiation prevents the formation of clouds, which have a cooling effect on the planet, therefore the temperature rises. </p>

<p>Other recent studies, published in Nature and other leading journals, conclude that the sun’s radiant heat and solar radiation levels affect planetary warming and cloud formation more strongly than acknowledged by Global Warming alarmists. After all, why would natural forces that caused the climate to change in past centuries suddenly stop now? And how does man-made Global Warming explain why every planet in our solar system appears to be simultaneously warming up? Does this not suggest that Global Warming is a natural cycle as a result of the dynamic nature of the sun? </p>

<ul>
<li>Space.com</li>
</ul>

<p><em>”Global Warming on Mars? A study of the ice caps on Mars may show that the red planet is experiencing a warming trend. If both Mars and Earth are experiencing global warming, then perhaps there is a larger phenomenon going on in the Solar System that is causing their global climates to change.”</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>National Geographic</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“NASA says its Cassini spacecraft has found a hurricane-like storm at Saturn&#39;s South Pole, nearly 5,000 miles across - or two-thirds Earth&#39;s diameter.”</em> </p>

<p><em>&quot;Global Warming Detected on Triton: At least since 1989, Triton has been undergoing a period of global warming,&quot;</em> </p>

<p>confirms astronomer James Elliot, professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Percentage-wise, it&#39;s a very large increase.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>“New Storm on Jupiter Hints at Climate Change: The latest images could provide evidence that Jupiter is in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit on different parts of the globe.”</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>Space.com</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“The Earth is getting hotter because the Sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1,000 years, according to new research published in the prestigious science journal Nature.”</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>London Telegraph</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from ignoring the giant ball of fire in the sky, Global Warming alarmists also overlook a few other inconvenient truths. They ignore the fact the natural emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere far exceed human contributions. In fact humans contribute a measly 0.035% of the total annual carbon flux. Any system that can be perturbed by such a tiny fluctuation would be very unstable indeed. They also ignore the fact that water vapour is by far the most dominant greenhouse gas. The atmosphere consists of 40,000 ppm of water vapour, whereas carbon dioxide weighs in at a miniscule 380 ppm. Instead they rely on dubious computer models that the IPCC itself admits exclude complex parts of the climate system that they don’t yet understand.</p>

<p>No, the point is that you think this is something that <em>needs</em> to be mentioned reveals how little you know about the scientific community. It&#39;s actually very common to have people hold contrary points of view within the community.</p>

<p>There is something you don&#39;t want to realize: that there are still lots and lots of scientists who back up AGW. Instead, you see one scientist who doesn&#39;t, or a few, and conclude the whole scientific community is working on a hoax. </p>

<p>Perhaps you should publish a paper about it, if you&#39;ve got such profound insights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Well, firstly, you said global temperature decreased since 1998. Now you&#39;re saying we have &quot;not observed any increase...&quot; Get your facts straight.&quot;</p>

<p>Uhhhh...what?  There&#39;s nothing wrong with what I said.  Yeah, the global temperature has decreased over the past 11 years, therefore the global temperature has not increased over the past 11 years, therefore we have not observed any increase in temperature over the past 11 years.  You&#39;re a retard.  Really, if you have any pride in yourself, you should feel really stupid right now.</p>

<p>&quot;And again, I ask, how fucking stupid do you have to be to believe 11 years on a four billion year old planet constitutes a trend?&quot;</p>

<p>How long is a trend?</p>

<p>Bringing up the age of the planet works in the advantage of man made global warming propaganda skeptics.  We live on a 4 Billion year old planet.  The Industrial Revolution happened almost 260 years ago.  That&#39;s a very skewed ratio of 40,000,000 / 2.6 (40 million / 2.6). Compare the ratio of 40,000,000/2.6 with 400,000,00/1. Both of those ratios are ridiculous.  So perhaps 260 years on a 4 billion year old planet is not long enough to determine a trend if 10 years is not long enough to determine a trend.  </p>

<p>This is the point: If industrialization was the cause of the warming, then it would have to be so significant that, out of nowhere, the planet could not experience 11 years of cooling. This could only happens if the warming was mostly due to natural causes like solar output.</p>

<p>Seriously, you&#39;re a clown. You&#39;ve been played SO hard, and it&#39;s all because you&#39;re dumb enough to be played by political scams.  Al Gore is one smart man, for it takes a smart man to manipulate so many dumb people like you and make lots of money from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Not decreas[ing]&quot; and &quot;increasing&quot; are <em>very</em> different things, fuckwit.</p>

<p>And before you get your oh-so-sensitive panties in a knot, maybe take a look around for what I said when someone replied &quot;Oh, but 30 years constitutes a trend?&quot;</p>

<p>Me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who&#39;s arguing that? I think both sides of this &quot;debate&quot; are equally retarded. Everything I&#39;ve learned from my EAS (earth and atmospheric sciences) classes, and archeological anthropology classes says that for the last few hundred thousand years we&#39;ve been in a general cooling trend. Who knows what the true &quot;trend&quot; is? What length of time defines a &quot;trend&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now for this little gem,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If industrialization was the cause of the warming, then it would have to be so significant that, out of nowhere, the planet could not experience 11 years of cooling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You talk like you&#39;re somehow anything more than a fat kid typing on a computer in your parents&#39; basement. Show me the studies that say &quot;If industrialization was the cause of the warming, then it would have to be so significant that, out of nowhere, the planet could not experience 11 years of cooling.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen, you fucking monkey, the earth has gone through worldwide ice ages and scorching worldwide drought over and over again cyclically before humans, before <em>mammals</em>, even existed. If you think 11 years proves anything, you need to pull your head out of your ass.</p>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s my uncles basement.  And I&#39;m 49-years-old.  And unemployed. And over 400 pounds. So technically I&#39;m more than just a fat kid, I&#39;m a 400 pound fat man child.</p>

<p>&quot;the earth has gone through worldwide ice ages and scorching worldwide drought over and over again cyclically before humans, before mammals, even existed.&quot;</p>

<p>Yup, that&#39;s why 260 years of industrial revolution is not the cause of the warming that had happened before the last 11 years.  The last 11 years marks the beginning of THE NEW COOLING TREND.  </p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100017393/climategate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-anthropogenic-global-warming/">http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100017393/climategate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-anthropogenic-global-warming/</a></p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If you own any shares in alternative energy companies I should start dumping them NOW. The conspiracy behind the Anthropogenic Global Warming myth (aka AGW; aka ManBearPig) has been suddenly, brutally and quite deliciously exposed after a hacker broke into the computers at the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit (aka Hadley CRU) and released 61 megabites of confidential files onto the internet. (Hat tip: Watts Up With That)</p>

<p>When you read some of those files – including 1079 emails and 72 documents – you realise just why the boffins at Hadley CRU might have preferred to keep them confidential. As Andrew Bolt puts it, this scandal could well be “the greatest in modern science”. These alleged emails – supposedly exchanged by some of the most prominent scientists pushing AGW theory – suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy, collusion in exaggerating warming data, possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information, organised resistance to disclosure, manipulation of data, private admissions of flaws in their public claims and much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the alleged emails has a gentle gloat over the death in 2004 of John L Daly (one of the first climate change sceptics, founder of the Still Waiting For Greenhouse site), commenting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In an odd way this is cheering news.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But perhaps the most damaging revelations  – the scientific equivalent of the Telegraph’s MPs’ expenses scandal – are those concerning the way Warmist scientists may variously have manipulated or suppressed evidence in order to support their cause.</p>

<p>Here are a few tasters. (So far, we can only refer to them as alleged emails because – though Hadley CRU’s director Phil Jones has confirmed the break-in to Ian Wishart at the Briefing Room – he has yet to fess up to any specific contents.) But if genuine, they suggest dubious practices such as:</p>

<p><strong>Manipulation of evidence:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Private doubts about whether the world really is heating up:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Suppression of evidence:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re AR4?  Keith will do likewise. He’s not in at the moment – minor family crisis.  Can you also email Gene and get him to do the same? I don’t have his new email address.  We will be getting Caspar to do likewise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fantasies of violence against prominent Climate Sceptic scientists:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next time I see Pat Michaels at a scientific meeting, I’ll be tempted to beat the crap out of him. Very tempted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Attempts to disguise the inconvenient truth of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Phil and I have recently submitted a paper using about a dozen NH records that fit this category, and many of which are available nearly 2K back–I think that trying to adopt a timeframe of 2K, rather than the usual 1K, addresses a good earlier point that Peck made w/ regard to the memo, that it would be nice to try to “contain” the putative “MWP”, even if we don’t yet have a hemispheric mean reconstruction available that far back….</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>And, perhaps most reprehensibly, a long series of communications discussing how best to squeeze dissenting scientists out of the peer review process. How, in other words, to create a scientific climate in which anyone who disagrees with AGW can be written off as a crank, whose views do not have a scrap of authority.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This was the danger of always criticising the skeptics for not publishing in the “peer-reviewed literature”. Obviously, they found a solution to that–take over a journal! So what do we do about this? I think we have to stop considering “Climate Research” as a legitimate peer-reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal. We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board…What do others think?”</p>

<p>“I will be emailing the journal to tell them I’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor.”“It results from this journal having a number of editors. The responsible one for this is a well-known skeptic in NZ. He has let a few papers through by Michaels and Gray in the past. I’ve had words with Hans von Storch about this, but got nowhere.

</blockquote>

<p>Hadley CRU has form in this regard. In September – I wrote the story up here as “How the global warming industry is based on a massive lie” – Hadley CRU’s researchers were exposed as having “cherry-picked” data in order to support their untrue claim that global temperatures had risen higher at the end of the 20th century than at any time in the last millenium. Hadley CRU was also the organisation which – in contravention of all acceptable behaviour in the international scientific community – spent years withholding data from researchers it deemed unhelpful to its cause. This matters because Hadley CRU, established in 1990 by the Met Office, is a government-funded body which is supposed to be a model of rectitude. Its HadCrut record is one of the four official sources of global temperature data used by the IPCC.</p>

<p>I asked in my title whether this will be the final nail in the coffin of Anthropenic Global Warming. This was wishful thinking, of course. In the run up to Copenhagen, we will see more and more hysterical (and grotesquely exaggerated) stories such as this in the Mainstream Media. And we will see ever-more-virulent campaigns conducted by eco-fascist activists, such as this risible new advertising campaign by Plane Stupid showing CGI polar bears falling from the sky and exploding because kind of, like, man, that’s sort of what happens whenever you take another trip on an aeroplane.</p>

<p>The world is currently cooling; electorates are increasingly reluctant to support eco-policies leading to more oppressive regulation, higher taxes and higher utility bills; the tide is turning against Al Gore’s Anthropogenic Global Warming theory. The so-called “sceptical” view is now also the majority view.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we’ve a long, long way to go before the public mood (and scientific truth) is reflected by our policy makers. There are too many vested interests in AGW, with far too much to lose either in terms of reputation or money, for this to end without a bitter fight.</p>

<p>But if the Hadley CRU scandal is true,it’s a blow to the AGW lobby’s credibility which is never likely to recover.</p>

There is no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy, no mention of George Soros nefariously funding climate research, no grand plan to ‘get rid of the MWP’, no admission that global warming is a hoax, no evidence of the falsifying of data, and no ‘marching orders’ from our socialist/communist/vegetarian overlords. The truly paranoid will put this down to the hackers also being in on the plot though.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his latest book, Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis, the man who won a Nobel prize in 2007 for his touring slideshow on disappearing polar ice and other consequences of climate change, concludes: &quot;Simply laying out the facts won&#39;t work.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead, Gore tells Newsweek magazine in a pre-publication interview, that he has been adapting his fact-based message - now put out by hundreds of volunteers - to appeal to those who believe there is a moral or religious duty to protect the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Royal Society, as a major part of the flowering of the tradition, was founded on the basis of scepticism. Its motto “On the word of no one” was a stout affirmation. Now suddenly, following their successful coup, the Greens have changed this motto of centuries to one that manages to be both banal and sinister – “Respect the facts.” When people start talking about “the facts” it is time to start looking for the fictions. Real science does not talk about facts; it talks about observations, which might turn out to be inaccurate or even irrelevant.</p>

<p>The global warmers like to use the name of science, but they do not like its methods. They promote slogans such a “The science is settled” when real scientists know that science is never settled. They were not, however, always so wise. In 1900, for example, the great Lord Kelvin famously stated, &quot;There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.&quot; Within a few years classical physics was shattered by Einstein and his contemporaries. Since then, in science, the debate is never closed.</p>

<ol>
<li> No denial by CRU, which you&#39;d expect to be forthcoming almost immediately if there were any holes in the story.  Not definitive proof, but certainly makes it more credible.</li>
<li> No, but it means that government funding at least in the UK has been used to manufacture false positives in favor of climate change, which amounts to at least fraud and conspiracy.  It certainly calls into question the &quot;proof beyond reasonable doubt&quot; and reopens the debate, which means several world leaders who spoke as if there was will be eating crow.  Especially if they continue trying to push emissions caps or cap &amp; trade schemes.</li>

<p>Sure, call it denial. I call it skepticism and scrutiny. You know, what scientists <em>are supposed to stand for?</em></p>

<p>Given the outcry that my questioning has brought up, I find it only too-<strong>ironic</strong> that people try to take the higher ground by suggesting I&#39;m in denial or religious because I&#39;m only questioning the information presented.</p>

<p>For instance, the wording that global warming &quot;isn&#39;t defeated.&quot;  Very similar to:  &quot;You haven&#39;t seen the last of me, He-Man!&quot;  That&#39;s not indicative of healthy skepticism.</p>

<p>That&#39;s some utter bullshit. You&#39;re judging the rationality of a position based solely on the tone of the person speaking - there are people who speak with a vehement tone (like me) for personal effect. Go up to any physicist and tell him/her that quantum mechanics is completely wrong because it&#39;s based on probability, how many won&#39;t call you a fucking idiot? Are they just in denial? </p>

<p>Here - let&#39;s scrap your ridiculous quantification of &quot;denial&quot; and use an actual definition: the act of asserting that something alleged is not true</p>

<p>Now skepticism: A methodology that starts from doubt and aims to acquire certainty</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at this again:</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure of the validity of these emails.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re in denial!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just because some people are in the wrong doesn&#39;t mean all people are in the wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>First, you are clearly emotionally opposed r/conspiracy and the claims this thread makes. So having an <em>actual conversation</em> is going to be hard.</p>

<p>Second: The very fact that they changed their pws does lend some credibility to this being real. How do we know the emails are real? We don&#39;t, but we also don&#39;t know we arn&#39;t in the matrix. Don&#39;t start talking about &#39;knowing&#39; shit. </p>

<p>Third: the Fallacy Fallacy. I like this point and I&#39;m glad you raised it. The only context I&#39;d like to add to that argument is that there has to be some level of influence from a) big business b) Gov&#39;t c) Money. Science isn&#39;t immune to these juggernauts. It isn&#39;t perfect, but it gets results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But then the world government would not have an excuse to tax carbon, you know, that same stuff we exhale with all our hot air.  Since I&#39;ve already stuck my neck out here, I&#39;ll go on to say that I&#39;m a huge proponent of actual environmental sustainability, which mostly has to do with stopping all war-fare, not using all kinds of industrial toxins, and ensuring that most agriculture and animal husbandry is diverse, small scale and local. </p>

<p>So what about all this extra carbon that us humans have been tossing out into the atmosphere like confetti at a new years party? Why is it not warming the planet? I read a little article about this in, of all things, discover magazine, when I was about 12 sometime back in the late 80&#39;s. It talked about this, and the ice age that the earth is overdue on. It rang true for me then, I&#39;ve never forgotten it or seen anything that made me think this was a false idea. It seems outlandish, however, what other explanations are there? </p>

<p>Any one for Tesla, secret weather control, and H.A.R.P working overtime?</p>

<p>Have the potential mysterious powers-that-be been &quot;saving&quot; us from the next Ice Age?  All this considered or set to the side, why are glaciers melting at such a rate while the earth cools? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, perhaps, submissions like this one are getting downvoted because reddit has a liberal bias, liberals are in favor of government regulations concerning global warming, and people <em>in general</em> are more interested in avoiding cognitive dissonance than honesty and objectivity.  Even if these scientists did not purposefully manipulate the data, there are some things in those emails that are worthy of concern. </p>

<p>I can understand that this particular submission is being downvoted, as the title has the typical <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> bent, but the others are much more objective, and one would like to believe that reddit thinks this issue at least as important as Amazon&#39;s dianetics review deletions... </p>

<p>No matter which side of the aisle you stand on regarding global warming, what humanity does regarding it in the next decade will have a huge impact on our future - therefore, it would behoove us to make sure we get things right.  These emails are a piece of evidence which need to be examined and either discarded or acted upon, and the best way to do that is to vote these submissions up.  If the emails are bullshit, the community will probably find that out.  If they are worthy of further concern and/or greater skepticism of the anthropogenic global warming movement, then hopefully, the community will discover that as well.  In a free society, suppression of information is almost always a bad thing, and this case is no exception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would buy the author&#39;s whole argument if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that we&#39;re still driving around in automobiles that utilize early 20th century technology! I think the democratic process has had its chance and the result has been utter failure. I mean for god&#39;s sake &quot;get real&quot;...we have a space station, that&#39;s in earth&#39;s orbit and which houses human beings for six months spans at any given time. We&#39;re in the process of allowing space tourism and yet we&#39;re still driving around in polluting &quot;Henry Fords&quot;! I ask you, who are we fooling? We had an excellent opportunity to address this matter during the late 20th century with the outsourcing of US manufacturing and industry. One again the democratic process prove exactly where its loyalties lie; the pursuit of wealth at all cost! The cost being that now we&#39;re ten times further away from any meaningful resolution for the issue of earth&#39;s ecological destruction. The time for fundamental change is NOW! We are beyond band-aid approach and fastly approaching the emergency &quot;open heart surgery&quot; option... and as we all know, any action done as a result of emergency actions never leads to optimal solutions. Quantitative action is needed and NOW!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to make this mess a bit simpler, let me explain...  The sun, obviously, has more effect on the Earth&#39;s temperature than mankind.  The global warm-ists try and discount this - the global warming-deniers try to emphasize it.  The problem is, when you look at all the different solar cycles, it&#39;s pretty obvious that we are currently in a cooling phase (the deniers NEVER mention this fact).  Yet, as you&#39;ve no doubt heard on tv, the Earth is getting hotter every year (with the few exceptions here and there, as you would expect in any chaotic system - which is probably what they&#39;re arguing about here).  When you put 2 and 2 together, the picture is much bleaker in reality.  <strong><em>The world is supposed to be cooling right now - but it&#39;s not!</em></strong>  The  cooling effect of the sun <em>is being vastly outweighed by humankind</em> - and, in a cruel twist of fate, since we&#39;re supposed to be cooling, <em>we aren&#39;t noticing</em> how much of an effect we&#39;re actually having.  The sun&#39;s natural cooling cycle is masking the horrors we&#39;re inflicting on the environment.  Here&#39;s something to think about:  If we&#39;re actually heating during a <em>cooling</em> phase - what&#39;s going to happen when we hit a warming phase (don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll all be dead by then, and we&#39;ll have long since killed most of the animals on the planet)?...  So, this is all a brouhaha over nothing - the rare year when the Earth actually cools like it&#39;s supposed to - the deniers are all over it and publicize it to death (just like they&#39;re doing here).  And, this will only end up with the general public questioning whether man-made global climate change exists (just like they&#39;re doing here).  So, the scientists are in a catch 22, they&#39;re damned if they do, damned if they don&#39;t...</p>

<p>Well I have my own article on where the heck is global warming ? We are asking that here in Boulder where we have broken records the past two days for the coldest days on record. We had 4 inches of snow. The high the last 2 days was below 30F and the normal is 69F, and it smashed the previous records for these days by 10F. The low was about 18F and also a record low, well below the previous record low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Note: This is a post written while I was angry, and thus may contain inaccuracies and exaggerations.]</p>

<p>Global warming conspiracy theories (and there are many, not all consistent) are lies. Spread by elite right-wingers like Rush Limbaugh, people in the pay of Big Oil, a handful of older scientists who can&#39;t face the truth (and are probably right-wing nuts too in many cases), and MILLIONS of ordinary people around the world who&#39;ve been sadly duped into believing them, or at least finding them credible.</p>

<p>But unlike 9/11 theories, which at least have the merit of (sometimes) providing an on-its-face plausible storyline for how the supposed 9/11 &quot;real events&quot; and/or the supposed 9/11 coverup <em>could</em> have occurred, global warming conspiracy theories don&#39;t even have that. They have no reasonable explanation, nor any evidence, for how virtually the entire global scientific community could have (by hypothesis) so utterly divorced itself from the truth. All they have is insinuations and hints, and (deliberate or accidental) misunderstandings of evidence such as that posted above, all of which don&#39;t stand up to cursory examination. Thus, only someone with their brain switched off could believe them. Thus, I&#39;m not even going to bother continuing this post, or this thread.</p>

<p>Sure, call it denial. I call it skepticism and scrutiny. You know, what scientists <em>are supposed to stand for?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I see in this thread is a bunch of idiots spouting off about how this apparently disproves the mountains of evidence that support global warming.</p>

<p>I tried mentioning not to commit the &quot;fallacy fallacy&quot; and got downvoted, called a religious fanatic, in denial, and unable to think for 10 seconds for it, in this very post. Then called childish - this place is a real bastion of reason.</p>

<p>You guys aren&#39;t looking to have a rational conversation here, you&#39;re taking everyone who is looking at this and asking if this really suggests global warming is a complete hoax and ganging up on them in a huge pile of bigoted bullshit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you came here because this story does interest you, but you&#39;re not interested in hearing a bunch of dumbasses who seem convinced this means global warming is entirely a complete hoax, head over to the submission in another reddit that gives a more rational response to this unfortunate revelation of the questionably sketchy tactics of a few scientists:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/a6i5g/breaking_hadley_cru_emails_hacked_they_show_an/">http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/a6i5g/breaking_hadley_cru_emails_hacked_they_show_an/</a></p>

<p>-OR-</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a6kcb/">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a6kcb/</a></p>

<p>Or just downvote this post in complete ignorance because you now have reason to rationalize why you think everyone who thinks global warming is a problem is a religious nutcase (???), and you&#39;d rather silence somebody for questioning your rash conclusions all while criticizing them for not liking to be questioned, I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>(P.S. Actually, try to upvote this, so people can see it and be redirected to the other link, as what I&#39;m saying is pissing a lot of these guys off and they&#39;re downvoting it thusly).</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m not so stupid as to make a huge leap of logic to suggest that one simple set of scientists fudging numbers suggests the entire academic field that seems to overwhelmingly support said theory are completely false at whim of a few cheating scientists.</p>

<p>Pardon me for not jumping to conclusions on simple whims, but I guess that&#39;s just the tantamount philosophy behind /r/<strong>conspiracy</strong>.</p>

<p>What is Mike&#39;s nature trick? what is the &quot;series&quot; they are adding the &quot;real&quot; data to? What decline are they hidin? We do not know.</p>

<p>In a confdential informal internal email it is possible they were using terms very loosely or with a specific meaning. For instance, if we sold original cheeseburgers, and cheeseburgers with gerkin, I might call the original cheeseburgers &quot;real&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t mean the ones with gerkin were falsified. </p>

<p>By the same token, &quot;hide&quot; may be used with any number of intents, it is possible it was intended to mean &quot;obscure&quot; or &quot;replace&quot;. </p>

<p>I am not saying I know what happened, and I am not saying they are innocent, I am saying that none of us know, this is not the absolute proof of guilt you are putting it forward as. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by &quot;this&quot; I assume you mean the information acquired from the emails that were hacked.  </p>

<p>This particular case demonstrates that scientists involved in the man made global warming campaign were actively altering their &#39;evidence&#39;:</p>

<p>&quot;I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.&quot;</p>

<p>They also demostrate just how unscientific these people are, intentionally trying to avoid and silence dissenting views:</p>

<pre><code>“This was the danger of always criticising the skeptics for not publishing in the “peer-reviewed literature”. Obviously, they found a solution to that–take over a journal! So what do we do about this? I think we have to stop considering “Climate Research” as a legitimate peer-reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal. We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board…What do others think?”

“I will be emailing the journal to tell them I’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor.”“It results from this journal having a number of editors. The responsible one for this is a well-known skeptic in NZ. He has let a few papers through by Michaels and Gray in the past. I’ve had words with Hans von Storch about this, but got nowhere. Another thing to discuss in Nice !”
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the man made global warming political campaign is not backed up by sound scientific evidence, so this doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.</p>

I&#39;ll just simply put it this way:  it&#39;s not surprising to me, after learning and following the scientific evidence, that man made global warming alarmists repressed dissenting opinion and fudged their evidence.  Does that sound more like a scientific code of conduct or a political campaign?</p>

<p>I say &quot;I told you so&quot; because the climate alarmists fudged their evidence and attempted to repress any dissenting opinions.  That&#39;s how the man made global warming hysteria was so successful.</p>
