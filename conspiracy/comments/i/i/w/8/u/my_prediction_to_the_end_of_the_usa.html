    <div class="md"><p>Israel probably has some of the missing Russian suitcase nukes and has secretly taken the US hostage.  Any other country like Israel would be heavily sanctioned but instead they get billions in aid every year and American outsourced jobs and control of the White House.   </p>

<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union there was minimal security and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR2IarjjmxE">large amount</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuke">suitcase nukes</a> went missing.   </p>

<p>They could already be planted in different places around the US and the country is secretly held hostage.  </p>

<p>What will come first, financial collapse or suitcase nuke detonation?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There IS a lot of nuclear terrorism going on... but this honestly is not the big problem because people know about nuclear bombs so they are not a good covert weapon of mass destruction.  People don&#39;t know that the US can control weather and so they are using this tool.  It&#39;s basically a weapon of mass destruction with built in plausible deniability.  They are using it to flood the midwest and as many as 16 nuclear power plants.</p>

<p>This is a good link to get caught up on the weather control technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia has claimed 84 are missing, but that does not mean they actually are. It is actually more likely they are assigned to black ops where deniability is a necessity upon implementation. The US simply ignores the treaty and makes micro-nukes in secret for it&#39;s similar operations. Under the circumstances, all the talk about the missing Russian nukes should really be taken as war-on-terrror propaganda. Unfortunately, the missing Russian nukes ruse gives the US plausible deniability when it chooses to nuke its own people in a false flag operation as well.</p>

For one thing, that would never happen, because telecom has many routes it can take to maintain communications. Also, did you know that there are millions of people in the middle of the country? Would they be cut off from the coasts as well? This idea is silly and you are very misinformed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bonds don&#39;t mean shit if you completely tank the dollar relative to the rest of the world, and inflation starts to run rampant, which will happen if you go bankrupt.  They&#39;re a good investment for the long term if the country is stable but in a collapse situation bonds could become virtually worthless.</p>

<p>The only way to protect yourself in this situation is to be completely divested from the USA, but in todays economic markets that&#39;s virtually impossible and highly improbable that these guys are interested in letting that happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bonds are the government debt. </p>

<p>if the government didn&#39;t issue bonds then they couldn&#39;t have debt, government debt is called bonds.</p>

<p>bonds are the dollar.. bond real return rates are already negative with stated inflation, if the government keeps  interest rates low, which they have to since raising the interest rate would create an infinite feed back loop of debt and hyperinflation..</p>

<p>the debt is unmanageable, and eventually investment bankers who manage mutual funds (think retirement savings accounts) won&#39;t roll the debt, and the american government won&#39;t sell bonds, hence, their credit card will be denied.</p>

<p>this is why the federal reserve is buying bonds through the TBTF banks (backdoor digital money printing), because if they didn&#39;t then we would face immediate hyperinflation.</p>

<p>they will do this for as long as they can, and they are doing it so that the elites can consolidate their holdings in land and commodities, in safe locations that can&#39;t be touched by america.</p>

<p>it&#39;s really pretty simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>really? &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t give a shit and have the ability to go wherever they want in the world.</p>

<p>globalists have no loyalty to any country, to them we&#39;re all the same, just sheep to be fleeced, the bankruptcy would allow for beautiful buying opportunities from now destitute metro areas, the elite who got out of the dollar and fiat in general would be able to make every bridge in america a toll bridge, every municipal water supply a private enterprise, the buying opportunities on the infrastructure would be multigenerational(as in sustain a ruling family for hundreds of years potentially) carve the whole mess up into fiefdoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they raise their debt ceiling, the debt they borrow will have to be at a higher interest rate because of the loss of confidence in the USA&#39;s ability to pay it back. Since we couldn&#39;t pay it before, we certainly can&#39;t pay it later when in interest is even higher than a rate that we couldn&#39;t handle in the first place.
