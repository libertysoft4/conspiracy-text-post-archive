    <div class="md"><p>Just a note to those worried: fluoride does NOT absorb through the skin so unless you&#39;re drinking your shower water don&#39;t worry about it. A shower filter for chlorine is great for your skin though.</p>

<p>Fluoride has no business being in our water supply as it works topically, not systemically. Toothpaste containing fluoride actually makes sense for the same reason, so if you&#39;re cavity prone don&#39;t write it off completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reverse osmosis water filters are the only ones that I know of that effectively remove fluoride. There are units available for your shower too, however the combined cost of one for your drinking water and one for your shower + filters can be prohibitively expensive. </p>

<p>We are getting a RO water filter soon for our drinking water but as I will still be taking showers in toxic waste water I will continue to take boron regularly (as I already do now) to remove the fluoride from my system. I was really worried about the effects of fluoride after extensively studying the topic, and boron was the easiest and cheapest remedy that I came across. Ideally though, it would be much better to not have to ingest any fluoride at all in the first place. Setting up your own water tank to capture rainwater for drinking/showering would solve this but obviously at quite some expense and you may have to filter that water anyway due to the large amounts of crap in the sky, and thus the rain, these days.</p>

<p>Oh also I never ever buy anything with added fluoride, especially toothpaste. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends a lot on your situation; for example, my water is fluoridated with sodium fluoride at .4ppm, which is really not very much. Since the water is hard, one can be assured that nearly all of that binds immediately to the calcium carbonate in the water, turning it into the harmless calcium fluoride one finds in tea.</p>

<p>That said however, I still have an RO filter for the chlorine, drugs, industrial solvents, and declining water infrastructure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Considering the money woes throughout most of the world, are there any sort of significant savings?  &quot;Flouride is poison, we don&#39;t need it in the water, and guess what all you people wanting to slash programs but not tax the ultra rich, we can SAVE money by not adding it.&quot;</p>

<p>This seems like the most influential way to influence the common American.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ecoloblue 30. </p>

<p>After I bought it, someone sent me a link showing a different companies model that was much cheaper, but the name escapes me. </p>

<p>Mine was about $1K all in. This model uses about 400W when running, which I would estimate it runs about 4 hours a day to keep up with what we drink out. So thats about $7 per month in electricity + $100 filters per year. (so about $20 per month). All in all the ongoing cost is not bad once you do the initial purchase. </p>
