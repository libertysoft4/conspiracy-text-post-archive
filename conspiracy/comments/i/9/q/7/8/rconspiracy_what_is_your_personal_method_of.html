    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start with mine:</p>

<p>I am skeptical to a fault sometimes. I hold the scientific method in high regard, and am even involved in research at a state university (Psychology).</p>

<p>While I do hold scientists in high regard, I usually read the methods section of research papers to get a good idea of how something was researched. That is how I decide how valid a particular piece is. </p>

<p>Because of this, I tend to remain skeptical of many mainstream opinions, as well as many conspiracy/supernatural opinions. I don&#39;t disbelieve them, but I don&#39;t hold them as truth unless I&#39;ve done my own research.</p>

<p>This has pretty much led me to become atheist.</p>

<p>When it comes to 9/11 I think it&#39;s possible that the gov&#39;t let it happen on purpose. I believe aliens probably exist, but I don&#39;t know whether or not they have visited us. I don&#39;t believe in paranormal or supernatural occurrences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I took my research methods class, we went over all the forms of scientific inquiry. When it comes to methods, it is pretty easy to spot a poorly designed experiment. The cases where comprehension would become an issue is if you were getting into mathematical proofs and physics. I will give you that. When you get into fields like that though, peer review is most important, and these people are working with things that likely can&#39;t be experimented on in the first place (Like string theory).</p>

<p>But when you get into independent variables, dependent variables, sample size, repeatability, and strength of a correlation, and other things like that, you don&#39;t need to be an expert in a specific field to understand if it set up correctly or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would hope so ;) I took research methods a year ago, and next semester I&#39;m taking a graduate level research methods class (Advanced research methods). One issue I see with mainstream media is this: A headline will read, &quot;New study links XXXX to XXXX.&quot; if you dig a little bit, you will find out that either the sample size is really small, or the correlational coefficient is only something like .0125, which is really weak. The news will leave that out, of course, and lead you to believe something that may or may not be valid.</p>

<p>Part of writing a research paper is the discussion in which you are required to discuss the limitations of your study, in the interests of academic honesty. So they are training us to be very critical of our own work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess what you will find is that you are lost by the end of the first sentence. Science at that sort of level is pretty much incomprehensible to other disciplines, and I strongly doubt whether you can make any sort of attempt to judge its strengths and weaknesses :)</p>

<p>Outside your field you probably can&#39;t judge poor scientific technique, so you have to make your judgement in terms of what &quot;other scientists&quot; say.</p>

<p>But then if Scientist A writes a paper, which scientists B and C say is poor, but scientist D says is okay, who do you believe?</p>

<p>Why is that different from person A seeing a ghost, which person B and C say they don&#39;t believe, but person D sees the same ghost as person A?</p>

<p>In science, experiments must produce the same results, otherwise they aren&#39;t considered valid. if B and C dispute a scientific paper, but run the experiment and get the same results and A, they have no basis for their argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>re: ghosts, and the burden of proof.</p>

<p>There are, I think, a wide range of human experiences for which there is little proof.</p>

<p>For example, as a thought experiment imagine I had no sense of humour. You watched a comedy and laughed, and claimed it was funny. I could say the burden of proof was on you to <em>prove</em> it was funny. How would you do it?</p>

<p>re: science. In the real world, science isn&#39;t as neat and clean as you hope. For example (and Feynman is very good on this), if Famous Theory predicts you should get a value of N for something, but you run the experiment and get N-10, do you publish that result? No, you look for errors in the experiment. Change a few things. Get N-7. Aha! Getting closer. One more run of debugging the procedure: N-4! woo! Then the next person gets N-1! (The twist in the tale is that theory was wrong, the true value SHOULD be N-10, but you didn&#39;t have the trust in your data).</p>

<p>That&#39;s a human failing, to get the results one expects. As a psychologist you should be very well versed in the terrible tricks our minds play on us :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s definitely an example. If I&#39;m standing in a room with someone, and they point at something that isn&#39;t there and start freaking out, chances are they are hallucinating.</p>

<p>But there are an array of explanations that exist:</p>

<p>1.) A hoax</p>

<p>2.) Someone misinterpreting what they sense</p>

<p>3.) Suggestibility (Like people who claim to have religious experiences)</p>

<p>4.) A dream</p>

<p>5.) And of course, it could be something paranormal</p>

<p>Now, strange shit has happened to me before. The thing is, based on what happened, I am not going to jump to a conclusion, because I can&#39;t based on what occurred. It isn&#39;t logical to claim number 5 happened when it is no more likely than any of the other events, and there is no evidence to back up that hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say hoax and trick of the mind are up there for most likely. Dreams are very likely as well. Maybe paranormal stories happen in a person&#39;s own home when you could be dreaming or having a waking dream. A fair amount of people can suffer from hallucinations, but I don&#39;t think that possibility is the highest. And highly suggestible people can be made to believe things quite often; just look at religion and hypnotism. Obviously it&#39;s a possibility that if could be paranormal, but I don&#39;t think it is very likely.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that if you can <em>prove</em> your point, it&#39;s not faith-based. Of course, one human can&#39;t be proven every scientific concept but still.</p>

<p>Absolutely not! Scientists are human beings, they are not some superior race of super-rational super-moral beings, immune to error or the lures of status etc :)</p>

<p>Are you really asking me to trust in the integrity of scientists whose work is funded by oil corporations -- papers which oddly come down on the anti-global-warming side?</p>

<p>ETA: go and read this, superb bit of Feynman, on missing scientific integrity:</p>

<p>Still, I&#39;d rather we call it &quot;trust&quot; instead of faith. I take faith to mean &quot;<strong>Complete</strong> trust or confidence in someone or something.&quot;</p>

<p>Allowing for papers and scientist&#39;s work to be disproved and minds to be changed isn&#39;t really <em>complete</em> trust. It&#39;s more like trust that experts in the field will want the truthest possible facts to be viewed as true by the public.</p>

<p>Besides personal reasons, they can be called out if they start spreading falseness by peers in their field. Of course, if everyone in the field agrees like a hive-mind to a conspiracy, it&#39;s harder for this mechanism to work. Nevertheless, tangential lines of evidence would probably awake some questions. So biggest mechanism would be peer-review of events and proclamations. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Especially after reading Feynman&#39;s monologue, I&#39;d say all that follow the scientific method with integrity are scientists as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it doesn&#39;t work great, bro. According to their own numbers, our medical system kills 100,000 people every year that otherwise would have lived. These numbers are for people who received the correct treatment with no error, and does not account for doctor error, hospital error, or opportunity cost for alternative treatments. All told, modern medicine easily surpasses heart disease as the greatest single killer of Americans.</p>

<p>I get that you are a supporter of science. I am as well in it&#39;s purest most unadulterated form, but what we call &#39;science&#39; today is often official myths put forth by those who stand to gain from it, supported by junk science that was bought and paid for before it ever occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In which way does modern medicine kill? Because even people receiving treatment are made aware of the chance they will die. The side effects and risk involved in any sort of treatment are known and disclosed to patients. Buy fuck, let&#39;s just get rid of it. It&#39;s not like medicine has helped save millions of lives or anything. </p>

<p>But you must be really removed from modern science if you think  scientists today are in it for the money. Given the amount of money professors at universities make, they are giving up much better paying alternatives to do what they are passionate about. </p>

<p>Obviously there will be corruption, as there is in every aspect of life. But one thing I find awesome is that corruption is easily weeded out of science. One recent example is the whole autism/vaccine link (Or the lack thereof). It turns out that the scientist who wrote the study who found the link between autism and vaccines fabricated data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you blaming the scientists?</p>

<p>If you want to blame someone, blame the executives and politicians that stand to make money by promoting a dangerous product. Scientists do research, but if you haven&#39;t noticed, these people don&#39;t profit from it. They get paid the same modest wage. The executives are the ones who stand to make millions off of that shit. Our country is getting fucked up the ass by the rich. There is a lot of talent in the US, but most of us are at the mercy of corporate interests. The research happens, people know what&#39;s up, and their shit is taken and given out by someone who wants money.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s the medical industry and you seem to be ignoring the broader range of science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire existence of science has been challenging the status quo. Every groundbreaking discovery in history has been met with skepticism. Nothing is wrong with this, as every one of these discoveries has proven their worth with time. The key difference is that these discoveries have been well backed up, and repeatedly confirmed over the course of time. They are testable, and when they aren&#39;t they stay as a hypothesis, not a theory.</p>

<p>I do have a few things to point out, that seem to get forgotten. Suppression of energy research? Look up what is going on with nuclear fusion. Half of the money spent of energy research is spent on nuclear fusion, which would totally fuck over the oil industry. Explaining the paranormal? Try showing me something that actually proves it beyond pure speculation. </p>

<p>At a university in my state, there is a professor that is fiercely trying to find bigfoot. You might call it suppression that nobody is taking him seriously, but you would be wrong. Nobody is telling him to be quiet. People don&#39;t take him serious because big foot is a legend; and in the decades that he&#39;s been hunting for big foot, he has produced Absolutely NOTHING that would point to his existence.</p>

<p>The problem is, if you try to shake the system, you better have a good argument. If you present them what these so called paranormal experts present them with, you won&#39;t be blowing anyone&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>1.) A hoax</p>

<p>Now, strange shit has happened to me before. The thing is, based on what happened, I am not going to jump to a conclusion, because I can&#39;t based on what occurred. It isn&#39;t logical to claim number 5 happened when it is no more likely than any of the other events, and there is no evidence to back up that hypothesis.</p>
