    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about the govt infiltrating Anon before. It&#39;s not hard to follow the logic in your link. Though it&#39;s possible that Anon is doing these things and the govt is trying to get them, I think we all know that it&#39;s impossible for the US govt to not have infiltrated at this point in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government infiltrating Anon? </p>

<p>Clearly you have no idea as to how Anon works. It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re in or not. Issues pop up, and the people that support an action, join up. Think of it like a blob. It&#39;ll take all it can get, and it&#39;ll let anything go that doesn&#39;t want to be in it, regardless however, the blob lives on through all events.</p>

<p>More closely, think of V for Vendetta.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Anon is some chaotic driven hive-mind... isn&#39;t it the least bit possible to think that this blob might be driven by a &quot;head&quot; or even an arbitrary &quot;pole&quot; that has a direction. </p>

<p>And if it does have a direction, as seen by many of the targets Anon has pursued, then is it really impossible to think that creation of this head might easily be made by anyone with enough influential channels?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to be a contrary dick here, but you just CLEARLY do not understand how anonymous operates.</p>

<p>There is no leadership, no grand wizard, if an idea looks appealing, people jump on it, if it doesn&#39;t - they don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except there are, actually, indeed people in leadership roles.  These people run the anonops IRC server and IRC channes, <a href="http://anonops.blogspot.com/">blogspot</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/anonops">Twitter</a>, and the now-down old anonops website, etc.  They may not be the official leaders, but people still look to these people for guidance about what to do.  They check these sites for updates and directions.  They are not official leaders, but they do fill the leadership roll.  In fact, the targets for Op Payback were pretty much decided among a small cabal in private IRC channels.</p>

<p>While it is true that if a bunch of self-identified Anon did something that goes against the &quot;leadership&quot; I&#39;ve been discussing, it&#39;s still Anonymous, because, indeed, Anonymous has no official leaders.  But to say that there is no leadership at all is pretty naive. </p>

<p>A fed could, theoretically, social-engineer himself into one of these secret IRC channels and direct Anonymous for his own means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what I mean. I hate when people say &quot;there is no leadership&quot;. There might not be a written name but there are people who submit ideas and takeover operations. And <em>that</em> right there is where I believe it is possible for government agents or officers working for the govt to infiltrate during these times when Anon needs people with expertise. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s so hard to imagine the FBI entering these channels and using them to give reasons to pass these unconstitutional Internet bills.</p>

<p>Being unknown is what makes Anon great but it&#39;s also what makes it dangerous as well. One never knows what is the motivation behind an operation. And like you said, stuff was decided in the private channels (much like how some Senate bills are passed at 3am in a closed door session). Who knows what goes in these chats. And again, like you said, it is naive for anyone to say that there is no leadership in Anon. Any operation, military or online, needs someone or a group of experienced people to lead the charge. That&#39;s basic war strategy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anon has leadership in the same sense that Reddit has leadership. And FBI infiltration is perhaps similar to Reddit infiltration in some ways (or spammer infiltration). Anyone can post a thought/link/idea and you&#39;ll have some people run with it (spreading the thought/link/idea), some questioning or calling it out, others will ignore it completely. When FBI does something stupid in the name of Anon, I&#39;m sure there are quite a few people sniffing for BS. It would take a significant effort to effectively infiltrate Anon in a meaningful way because of this de-centralized hive-mind organization, but it&#39;s definitely possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t really have a head. That&#39;s the deal - there is no central, or overriding authority. It&#39;s a collective. It&#39;s so mind bogglingly simple, that it often makes people over think it. People don&#39;t need to have an authority figure to do work, but they need a consensus of sorts.</p>

<p>Someone comes up with an idea, and others join into it (or don&#39;t). </p>

<p>That&#39;s the biggest problem people have with regards to wrapping their heads around how it works. It&#39;s a collective. You can join too if you want. Hell, you are already a part of it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an idea. People in this world are dicks. Anon is the anti-dick. Dickish in their moves, but more or less for the good of the people.</p>

<p>The ember is the idea. </p>

<p>Think of it like reddit - someone (anyone) submits a post, and others either downvote it to hell, or upvote the shit out of it. </p>

<p>Really - watch V for Vendetta. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my point. The timing is <em>too</em> convenient and considering how LulzSec is &quot;affiliated&quot; with Anon, anything LS does can be used to prosecute Anon members under the guise of &quot;protecting the Internet from hackers&quot; despite 3/4ths of Anon being script kiddies. </p>

<p>This all started with the Patriot Act being passed within days after 9/11 (which, more than likely, was let happen in order to be the reason to pass the PA).</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that an anonymous group hasn&#39;t been infiltrated by someone. It&#39;s just unlikely and implausible that no agency or sec firm has been involved or at least kept tabs on some of the ops going in Anon. </p>

<p>So unless Lulzsec or any other group is a close-knit group of friends they are probably Feds or covertly run by the Feds in some capacity. </p>

<p>Remember that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emad_Salem">leader of the 1993 WTC bombing</a> was an FBI informant who thought he was just going to set up a fake bomb to get &quot;real&quot; terrorists.

    <div class="md"><p>But then Anon wouldd denounce those people and the story would become too complex for the public to care about.</p>

<p>Besides, Anon has said repeatedly that it is a decentralized group with no power structure. A little while ago someone spoke to the press, claiming to be a &quot;leader of Anonymous&quot;. This person was quickly shown to be a fraud, and the story quickly went away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>funny thing...</p>

<p>if Anon is decentralized with no power structure, how does <em>any</em> press release get vetted? for that matter, how you could Anon show that one part of Anon (that say, blew up a bus) was not affiliated with another part of Anon (that say, ddos&#39;d a website)?</p>

<p>literally anyone can claim to be acting on behalf of Anon and no one can legitimately deny that claim. (though of course &quot;leadership&quot; is an entirely different bug)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  Lulzsec has shut down the PSN network, attacked high profile websites, declared war on the FBI, hacked the US Senate page, and yet the government has turned a blind eye to this activity (even after claiming hacking attempts against the government are &quot;acts of war&quot;!).  It&#39;s quite suspicious.  They&#39;ve arrested Anonymous members for much less, namely LOIC use.  While it&#39;s obviously easier for law enforcement to track down a bunch of unskilled LOIC users than skilled hackers, I find it very hard to believe that FBI or other three letter agencies don&#39;t have the resources to take them down.  It&#39;s also no secret that the government hires good hackers or keeps them around through consultant gigs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s happening to pass anti-internet legislation. Definitely. Everyone already knows that part. The part you <em>don&#39;t</em> know is that you&#39;re <em>supposed</em> to know that part. You&#39;re <em>supposed</em> to think these things. It&#39;s all part of the plan.</p>

<p>Lulzsec is getting super popular so nobody misses the details as they&#39;re happening. They&#39;re riding the viral internet in plain sight. They&#39;re also talking about Freemasons and reptilians blah blah blah in order to get the attention of the conspiracy crowd.</p>

<p>the purpose of the attacks is not internet controls so much as it is to simply make people believe in the complete false narrative. This only happens when people see the narrative unfolding. Lulzsec and their antics are one means of drawing attention to the narrative.</p>

<p>the real goal, beyond internet controls, is for people to evolve their consciousnesses by <em>discovering</em> the false narrative and how it works. This happens over time as the narrative becomes more observable and more of its workings can be seen. The purpose of this evolved consciousness is to allow a false understanding of God and the universe to be confirmed. The pieces are already in place. The New Age, UFO, and mystical propaganda is the hypothesis, but the evolved consciousness will be the proof. The end game is the eclipse of the Christian God.</p>
