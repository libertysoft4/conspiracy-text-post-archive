        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By now, almost everyone is aware that Bill Gates thinks that solar power is &quot;cute&quot;.  Just now, I read <a href="http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20110615p2a00m0na001000c.html">this article from Japan</a>, where the author makes a number of logically flawed attacks on solar power as a replacement for nuclear. It gives the impression that the author is aware that there is no reason to oppose solar power anymore, so he resorts to an entirely emotional argument, which basically boils down to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just think about it. Could you catch rabbits using a solar-powered buggy? I would go for a car with a diesel engine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With solar power scheduled to replace coal as the cheapest power source in 2 or 3 years, is there a conspiracy being put in place to prevent solar power from coming into widespread use?  What will the Bill Gates of the world do in order not to relinquish their centralized control of electricity generation?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>  Solar is <a href="http://www.celsias.com/article/nanosolars-breakthrough-technology-solar-now-cheap/">already cheaper than coal</a> or according to other sources will reach that level within <a href="http://unbridledspeculation.com/2011/06/09/solar-cheaper-than-coal-in-3-5-years-ge-and-first-solar-think-so/">3 to 5</a> years.  Moore&#39;s Law seems to apply so it will continue to get better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just imagined ordering a Solar System (star, planets et al.) from the power company.  Funny...  </p>

<p>In looking at the ones I know about vs the systems that a smaller company can design and install it is about the flexibility of the business model.  The power company will create a payment system with a generous buffer to make the actual cost of the system comparable or marginally cheaper than staying on the regular power system. </p>

<p>When you compare the end to end cost over say 10-15 years depending. it is a far higher cost getting into business with the power company than engaging a seasoned solar professional and paying them for the system and installation.  </p>

<p>I would not suggest you borrow money or purchase on credit. That is a fundamental control system currently being used en masse. It erodes your ability to be free of things you have no dominion over.</p>

<p>The power company will be just as happy to buy the excess energy from you regardless if you bought the system from them or not.  At least where I live. In the end spinning the numbers to see the true ROI of a solar system should be the deciding factor.  If you are building a new house or doing a large renovation to an older property this is the optimal time to install, as it can be folded into the big unavoidable credit block needed to pay for something of that size.  An excellent option if you have some open land you own is to build a solid base (cement/steel) and put panels on posts.  It would be comparable to having your own solar farm. Then it can be added to, or simply upgraded and there is no need to design the panel systems into your home. In theory...</p>

Every single time it&#39;s mentioned the response is very measured, negative and begins with, That technology is still decades away. They pat me on my head and send me on my way. I have planned to just build what I&#39;m gonna build and use it. When it&#39;s working, If I can make it work, I probably won&#39;t care too much about their responses anymore. I&#39;ll be sharing the info and others can do it too.  There are so many people out there like this.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced this should be a decentralized technology adopted by those willing to learn how it works and how to maintain it for themselves. Most people want the result without the effort.  this opens them up to the whims of corporations who will try to figure out a way to make you pay for your solar energy by the month, take the extra power and sell it to the highest bidder. In Alberta the power companies are doing their best to lock this down like this and the province seems super good with it.  </p>

<p>They don&#39;t even want to acknowledge solar furnace technology. I suppose any new technology has it&#39;s uphill battle. </p>

<p>Batteries to store the solar power, bad. Too inefficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar with this, there is also a big misunderstanding in nuclear energy. Sure, the nuclear waste is difficult to place, but other than that, Nuclear power plants kill less people than coal and has less radiation. Also, one of the reasons why the Nuclear power plant in Japan had a melt down is becuase it was a 40-50 year old model and cheaply made. (it&#39;s kinda like trying to run you&#39;re 20 year old computer). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nuclear energy is a different animal altogether.  It gets its support from people who like centralized control.  In other words, the power elite.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Funny, how you can say that as if it was a minor problem.</p>

<p>Solar energy is unique in that it is subject to Moore&#39;s law, and it continues to get exponentially cheaper.  Nuclear cannot compete with that.</p>
