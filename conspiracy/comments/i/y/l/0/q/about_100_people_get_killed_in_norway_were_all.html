    <div class="md"><p>The Norwegians weren&#39;t part of an oppressive dictatorship that was trying to put down a rebellion? Oh look, <a href="http://our-daily.com/rights-group-6000-people-killed-libya/2571/">6000 people killed</a> by the Libyan government when protests started. But, no, no, you&#39;re right, it&#39;s better if they stay under Gaddafi.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - pretends that government is killing thousands of people, cries out for action</p>

<p>Libya - Government kills thousands of people, action taken. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - OMG WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!! OILLLLLL!!!111 </p>

<p>But honestly, I know arguing with you people is stupid. You live in your little fantasy worlds where only you can know the truth. You base your beliefs on assumption, and listening to any asshole that says they know what they&#39;re talking about as long as what they say is different from what is typically believed. The more outrageous the better. It&#39;s an odd way to justify your existence, to try to show how much better you are by believing what others don&#39;t believe and labeling it the truth. If the whole world suddenly started to agree that 9/11 was a conspiracy you&#39;d insist that it was terrorists. </p>

I have no clue what is going on in Lybia, the only thing I have heard is that there are still a lot of people on Gaddafis side.

    <div class="md"><p>As many other people criticizing &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, you do exactly the thing that you accuse them of doing. You make outrageous claims based on heresay, a priori and without checking your sources.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know either way. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s good or bad that NATO bombs Libya. What I do know is, that their reasoning is inconsistent. There are plenty of violent dictators, many of whom NATO and the US supports, why aren&#39;t they a problem? Why not try to dethrone dictators we can pressure diplomatically and financially instead of going after the ones we have to bomb? Why is Libya worse that Bahrain, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Bella Russia? Why did we support Suharto, Marcos, Ceaucescu and Pinochet, if we don&#39;t like dictators? Why do we carry out warcrimes, if we believe them to be wrong?</p>

<p>I also know that whenever ad hominem attacks are employed, it&#39;s usually because there are no stronger arguments for whatever case is being made. Your &quot;argument&quot; is all ad hominem. </p>

<p>There are a lot of conspiracies that I do not believe to exist, but to discount an explanation, that is based on evidence and sound reasoning, because it entails a conspiracy, is idiotic. </p>

<p>Obviously conspiracies exist. Most major crimes are the result of conspiracies - unless you think individuals carry out all the big crimes. </p>

<p>Saying conspiracies are false by definition is tantamount to saying that all crimes are committed by individuals, never by groups. And that makes very little sense.</p>

<p>Now, from reading your post, I can only assume that:</p>

<p>a) You&#39;re retarded (no offense to the mentally handicapped intended )</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) That you&#39;re deliberately behaving like you have no concept of reason and no capacity for analysing information.</p>

<p>In either case, you should probably let the adults have their discussion and go back to whatever you enjoy doing.</p>

<p>And on the subject of Norway:</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s important. We need to say hell no to terrorists of all kinds, blonde or brown and bearded, in uniforms or turbans - or suits.</p>

<p>The problem being pointed out here, is our hypocricy. It&#39;s very simple. If it&#39;s wrong when <em>they</em> do it, it&#39;s wrong when <em>we</em> do it. If we try to justify our own crimes while criticizing others for theirs, we&#39;re hypocrites.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re not a hypocrite, are you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I wasn&#39;t trying to make the case for conspiracies, I was trying to point out our hypocrisy. However, I do believe it&#39;s in violation of international law to manipulate foreign government, it&#39;s also in violation of the Logan act for unauthorized citizens to conduct covert negotiations with foreign governments. Obviously it&#39;s in violation of international law to support terrorist groups and to overthrow foreign leaders. The US has overthrown many democratically elected leaders.</p>

<p>The  definition of a conspiracy, as I understand it, is two or more people getting together to plan and carry out a crime. In the case of covert or overt support for foreign dictators, terrorists and attack on democratically elected leaders, the US comes up with a good excuse, but I find it unlikely that the people in power are unaware of say the true nature of the Contras, Saddam, Suharto, Marcos and the rest of the dictators they have supported.</p>

<p>To get together with your industry friends or political friends or both and plan for instance, the invasion of Iraq, while launching a propaganda campaign to convince the public that Saddam has WMDs, is a conspiracy. By definition. </p>

<p>There was no security council mandate to attack Iraq and there was no attack on the US or her allies, so self-defense could not be claimed. </p>

<p>Therefore, those who brought that war about through misleading the public and carrying out policies in violation of international law, are conspirators.</p>

<p>Edit: Incidentally, the US is the only country, as far as I know, to ever be convicted of international terrorism by the International Court of Justice. The US vetoed it, of course. Can you imagine that in a court of law? The defendant having the option to veto the court&#39;s decision? Horrid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, well said. I just thought you were trying to use rhetorical questions to prove a point which set off my bullshit detector.</p>

<p>I agree with your sentiments, but I have to point out that the nature of international law is very nebulous. Breaking international law (which nations do every day, ironically) isn&#39;t really the same as holding up the local convenience store.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s become that way, but really, the US and her allies set international law during the Nürnberg tribunals. We defined warcrimes as everything the nazis did and we didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>So bombing cities is ok, but experimentation on humans and death camps aren&#39;t. We did agree, though, that aggression is the worst warcrime there is, because &quot;in it is contained all the evils of war&quot;.</p>

<p>So, &quot;we&#39;re&quot; kinda doing the stuff we let the nazis hang for, when we invade Iraq with none of the conditions (defined by us), that allow for &quot;legal&quot; war, met. </p>

<p>Anyway... It&#39;s a long debate and it&#39;s easy to get lost in details. I just think we should be more weary of war. The founding fathers were, most soldiers are, people are in general. War should really be the last resort for any democracy, as I see it. </p>

<p>Even presuming, that we have the right to interfere and the our cause was just, which is highly dubious, can we really say, in the case of Libya or Iraq, that we had exhausted all other means of resolving the conflict? </p>

<p>I think the answer to that is obvious. </p>

<p>We really need to be more mindful of the world around us and we need to understand that actions have consequences. No-one wants to live in a world of terror and war, hell, those are the reasons we give for going to war in the first place: Peace and security - however odd that seems.</p>

<p>War is really a messed up way of solving problems and conflicts. I would agree, that an army that can match the most dangerous potential advesaries might be a good idea, but to have a defense budget equalling that of the rest of the world combined sends the message not of a peacekeeper, but of a bully.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the solution to all our problems, but I do know, that if we want to continue civilization and evolve in an interesting direction, we need to work together. </p>

<p>The battle lines are being drawn and the world is being fragmented further, on one side the US, on the other Russia, China - to oversimplify. What I think we forget, is that the world cannot afford for two industrialized nations to go to war ever again - it would mean destruction for most of us - and for our habitat.</p>

<p>And no-one wants that, I hope. We need to work together, damnit. </p>

<p>Solidarity and empathy are as much a part of the human nature as aggression and self-preservation is, but we tend to forget that. Only if we have real peace can we employ our limited resources in a constructive way, not to build bombs and tanks, but to develop new technology that will allow for the continuation of our civilization.</p>

<p>The alternative is that there will be no civilization for anyone to rule, no real future control. We need to remember that and raise our ambitions - for all of humanity.</p>

<p>Edit: And thanks, I wasn&#39;t trying to be polemic. I just really feel that we&#39;re messing up all our chances and wasting our time throwing stones at each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, if not a little inflammatory (though I have been guilty of that myself here). It&#39;s really hard to keep a level head when people constantly respond to your well-reasoned arguments with conjecture and rhetorical questions, always furthering the theory with another &quot;fact&quot; they learned that doesn&#39;t exactly fit with their layman&#39;s understanding of how things are &quot;supposed&quot; to happen.</p>

<p>That said, I think the cause is more of a tendency to want to ascribe a greater meaning to important events. It&#39;s really not that different from believing in a creator, deity, whatever. Some people need to believe that there is something greater out there, and labeling every event as a conspiracy allows them to ignore the fact that <strong>sometimes really shitty, horrible, violent, bloody things happen for no reason at all</strong>. That&#39;s a hard pill to swallow for some.</p>

<p>To be serous though, a military operation/civil war is different than slaughtering 80 teens and blowing up an entire block. You need to provide some context about the Libyans.

In particular in this case I spent two months researching and writing an 8 chapter long article on what is going on in Libya on a website me and a few other people run here in Iceland.

<p>Nato bombed the shit out of Serbia and even destroyed some of Belgrade&#39;s downtown. They took out hospitals and local shopping center&#39;s. I was just in Belgrade this summer and some of the buildings still haven&#39;t been fixed. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe, but It doesn&#39;t add up that the US and Nato go for Libya and not for the other dozen corrupt African countries. There is something else, water, oil, whatever it may be. </p>

<p>I guess you wouldn&#39;t believe sources I give you, but this one could give you perspective.</p>

<p>Of course that western media avoid to talk about it, and given that in some areas there are no western journalist only Gadaffi force</p>

<p>And this one is most recent Nato casualties

<p>Before you discard me as a lunatic, I don&#39;t believe western media because in Serbia Nato protected civilians by: &quot;for every Serbian soldier killed by NATO in 1999, for example, four civilians died.&quot; source:
<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/09/24/un_report_a_victory_for_terror/">http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/09/24/un_report_a_victory_for_terror/</a>

but i doubt u cared when gaddafi killed thousands of protesters, and promised to &quot;cleanse&quot; benghazi (as he did to zawiya), stating he will do as russia and china did to their dissenters in the past</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the resources you are utilizing for news.  I routinely watch the Arab speaking news channels-- needless to say Al Jazeera is doing a very good job of covering those atrocities, not just in Libya but all over the Arab world, and I might add, Africa.  There are massive atrocities in Africa that get very little, if any coverage, in American media.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t speak Arabic, Al Jazeera English is pretty accessible in the States.  They do cover it.</p>

<p>Too, the tragedy in Norway isn&#39;t exactly getting overwhelming news coverage in the States.  Once it was determined Muslim extremists weren&#39;t involved, the coverage went almost silent.  When it first occurred, I heard nothing but stories about &quot;Islamic chatter&quot; on &quot;websites.&quot;  When it turns out a white guy did it, CNN went right to Nancy Grace bitching about the Casey Anthony verdict.  </p>

<p>As far as European coverage, they are naturally going to have a greater interest in this story than any other because of their proximity to Norway.  </p>
