    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking something similar, but at the same time also this post had me thinking about the intentions of those we think of as the elite and who they are and I can&#39;t work out in my mind any of these things.</p>

<p>OP raises some interesting points but I cannot help but feel that those directing things need the cooperation of the population or at least a passive confused, distracted herd who accept the ever changing status quo.  I think there is a lot of evidence for a long history of propoganda and other efforts to shape opinion even truth and keep people in the dark generally and if that is the case then why?  Is it because the masters are non benevolant or because manipulation creates less friction than physical force?   </p>

<p>Clearly though physical force is routinely used in war and the threat of prison hangs over anyone who deviates from what is acceptable.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect">100th monkey effect</a> hmm, never came across that before.</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether or not this is confirmation bias but it seems that distrust  and a questioning attitude towards authority has been growing.  Logically the internet has created this effect and so that would seem like where the battleground is, and that is where we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever played chess?</p>

<p>It is amazing how many times you can turn around a position. Right now the situation is pretty close and the situation is even quite promising. I used to play chess a lot as a kid, and was the Nordic champion for example. I managed to turn around a lot of positions just by not resigning the game when it turned bad. Over the past years a lot of people have been trying the same both on a local and on a global level.</p>

<p>The elites can only react and counteract what these people, organizations and in some cases countries are doing to prevent them from reaching their goals. A lot of progress has been made and it doesn&#39;t need a whole lot more to tilt things the right way.</p>

<p>The moment you decide there is no chance is the moment you&#39;ve lost. And there is no excuse for giving up at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think March 20th is the key date. That is when Greek debt is due, and Greece at this point is expected to default. An uncontrolled Greek default alone could spell disaster for the financial empire of the elites, but there are other moves that seem to be materializing and they could deal the mortal blow. Iran has declared it is going to start an oil bourse on the exact same date where they will exchange oil for currencies other than the US dollar. I don&#39;t think it is a mere coincidence they have chosen that date, and I think it is a signal to other countries to take action as well. India has declared its willingness to purchase Iranian oil with gold. Russia and China have been gradually reducing their exposure to US treasuries. And Japan has announced it may take over its own central bank. I think we have the perfect storm, and this may be the time when we may witness the undoing of the western financial empire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off you are probably living in the heart of the machine, so your perspective is quite skewed with fear.  There are a lot of places on Earth that are free and will be for a long time to come.  Secondly what will happen if the &quot;elites&quot; win and get total control?  You don&#39;t know.  Maybe once they have total awareness they will finally be able to recognize what is good and turn off their evil system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really think that the elite sociopathic .0002% of the population can enslave the rest into lives of misery, poverty, and slavery forever? Bullshit. We have Oathkeepers to keep the military in check, we still have a few good cops, we have a LOT of gun owners who are carrying more and more. As someone who worked with directed energy weapon R&amp;D at Aberdeen Proving Ground, I can say that yes, we do indeed have some mindblowing sci-fi shit in the hands of the military and police right now.....
          But those in power have been screwing the military over worse and worse since vietnam. They&#39;re telling dying 9-11 responder cops to go die on their own dollar. So until they have an army of humanoid robots that can tend to their every need, the elite are extremely vulnerable to well-deserved betrayal from any and all of their underlings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is quite interesting that the more we attempt to fight the system, the easier it is for societies elite to control us. THough we think we live in a relatively free society, every facet of our lives is controlled and monitored. The problem we face is our inability to coordinate an effective and streamlined resistance which encompasses the majority, the public. Our continued content with the tightening grip of our governments is our undoing. Similar to the ranking of a battalion, the general cannot fight the enemy when his troops are in disrepute. The only reason they have control is because we give it to them, in return for safety, oppression and security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>individual mindset and knowledge how mass psychology works is more important than paranoid fear of opressive technology. think of 1984 and brave new world as cultural inoculums, artificial implants of our (sub)consciousness that we have to replace with our own culture, own myths and own visions and paths to our different future. we must work on that, throw out the old and <em>create</em> the new - they (1984, bnw and all their cultural derivatives) are nothing but attempts at a self fulfilling prophecy. toxic programming. most of our culture is just that or was hijacked to be just that. mostly it is created out of thin air.</p>

<p>but fatalism is not a healthy mental attitude. the essence of being alive is to change freely in response to the environment.</p>

<p>malignant technology is pointless if you consider that the elites need us way more than what we need them. today, noone is detached from the society and if they choose to kill us, they will be gone too. therefore their tech and power are like a potemkin village, a facade with real living people on both sides. mirage. maya. once we are all fed up, unified actions will make surveillance useless - if we are <em>all</em> against the system the system will be too overwhelmed to respond effectively (like a universal ddos attack) - there is a definite cut-off point in the pyramid, below which things run out of control... and when i say <em>all</em> i dont think the population of the us, but all (99.999%) of us. they are wastly outnumbered.  when will this change happen is really up to us - the people, not r/conspiracy mind you - and making it happen will involve some self sacrifice, but we are used to that already, aren&#39;t we?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you really think there is a chance of beating the powers that be? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The chances are 100%. There is no reason to &#39;beat&#39; them, since they are either going to be crushed under the wheels of progress or destroy themselves. Their reign is coming to an end one way or the other. The only problem is weather we will survive the process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More importantly.... do you realise the fundamental properties of the universe? Do you realise that this universe is all about dominating other life forms? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you have gotten it all wrong: that is a property of a primitive life form. Most people are still rather entangled with their primitive instincts, but for quite some time there have been those who are above savagery and irrational madness. On an intelligent level dominance is understanding of others and making all resistance unnecessary. Greed and lust cannot coexist with true intelligence. The smart crave not for power and wealth, but for knowledge, understanding and unity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mainstream science is saying there will be artificial intelligence computers more powerful than the human brain, within just a few years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>More intelligent in what form? Calculating the trajectories of sand particles in a sandstorm? This artificial &#39;intelligence&#39; does not necessarily include consciousness and therefore most likely wouldn&#39;t possess intelligence any greater than a bucket of rocks. Assuming that this AI shall be genuinely conscious and intelligent, it would most probably select one of the few paths of possibilities available to it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The humanity is a burden and a competitor and therefore should be eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p>The humanity is a burden and therefore should be ignored. The AI will go its separate way.</p></li>
<li><p>The humanity as a creator must be understood and protected. Golden age for humanity.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The elite are going to merge with these super-powerful machines, such that they are forcibly more intelligent than us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that merging the human brain with technology to gain intelligence without the loss of other cognitive functions is even possible: If people and these &#39;elites&#39; would see even a part of the way things really are, they would weep at their own foolishness. The sheer shock of knowledge would shatter their elite world beyond the desires to rule the common men who even with the smallest boost of intellgence would know that they have been played for the last 4000 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, my question is... Does anyone in this subreddit actually believe we can fight against a technological dictatorship like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took you quite a while to form your actual question, eh mate? ;)</p>

<p>None of us would be here if we would believe otherwise. While I cannot contribute on behalf of other people in here, I can speak freely for myself. I personally have faith in humanity, since there&#39;s really no other way to go about it. Sure, I know of the problems we are having: religions of mass destruction, stupidity, greed, corruption, outdated economic system, energy crisis, massive conspiracy to keep the humanity enslaved and approaching overpopulation issue in the horizon. The best solution out of this crisis would be one that would not result in destruction of the human civilization and would bring as little suffering as possible. While most people are unable to comprehend this picture, it is quite easy to avoid unnecessary suffering just by letting people know what is going on.</p>

<p>The truth is that the elites are struggling to hold their power. They know they are running out of time. Desperate times require desperate measures. Their best attempt to hold power would be to postpone the inevitable by causing wars and destruction. I myself believe that they have been creating and preparing America and ultimately Israel for this war. They want to revive the current economy and to diminishing the human population by the means of war. Their plan to avoid the after-war crisis is to replace the Old World Order with a prison planet.</p>

<p>The front line at the moment is the Internet. With free Internet they cannot push through their plan forward and so they invest into censorship, political corruption and blogola (misleading the public by implanting seeds of doubt and by providing crazy conspiracy theories which would only distract people from the real issues at hand). Our best chance is to spread information, protect the Internet and to stand against war and violence, which they would want us to have. In my opinion r/conspiracy is doing pretty good job. Keep it going guys/gals!</p>

<p>This is brilliant.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also mused that once whoever-it-is gets absolute power and knowledge, they&#39;d end up realizing their mistake.  You&#39;d have to stay dumb and ignorant to stay evil.  It&#39;s a catch-22, but a good one.</p>

<p>This hidden wifi is new to me.  Is it in the wiki file?</p>

<p>Maybe I am trying to be too rational about it and using my limited technical knowledge cannot understand how it would be possible. Is it not the case that your wifi adapter generally has only a certain range so a secret network router for want of a better word, how does your adapter communicate?  </p>

<p>When you say recording audio. do you mean via the phone  or another way?  Ive heard before that its possible to eavedrop on a phone even powered off and the paranoid remove their batteries, but I think you tend to notice  a much shorter talk time if there if the phone is transmitting a call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is bogus. There is no way a satellite from orbit can connect to the network card on your computer. I would be far more likely to believe that they can eavesdrop on you using a van parked nearby via some security whole in the proprietory Mac/Windows OS network stack. That would be a reasonable proposition. But to say they can spy from orbit is absurd. Not even the FBI can violate the laws of physics. A healthy dose of paranoia and doubt is always healthy, but at these levels you are only doing damage to your sanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Protect yourself from EMF low frequency attacks with silk. How do you identify silk ? Rub it on a glass rod to see if glass rod starts to get sticky with small pieces of paper.  </p>

<p><a href="http://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php?topic=16513.0">http://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php?topic=16513.0</a></p>

<p>Q: (S) Well, this kind of my question. Because we have cell phones that are so evil, right? The problem is that even if you never use a cell phone, there are towers EVERYWHERE. If a cell phone is on and it&#39;s close to you, that&#39;s worse, but... (L) You can&#39;t escape it all. (S) So we can obviously turn off the evil stuff, but... (L) I think there&#39;s also the stuff out there for cancelling that is dietary {like minerals}, or something you can do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: Silk is always good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Q: (Ark) But coming back to this USB stick and little antenna which is probably very weak, what would be the distance from this that you would consider to be safe?</p>

<p>A: 2 meters.</p>

<p>Q: (Ark) Oh, so this is really weak. (S) Is it the same for WiFi? (discussion of evil microwaves and what to do)</p>

<p>A: Consider a &quot;Faraday cage&quot; for ___ until she is stronger.</p>

<p>Q: (___) They&#39;re gonna put me in a cage! Aah!! (L) Where the heck would we get one? (Ark) No, that&#39;s impossible. (J) You can build one! (L) Well, they put it in quotes, so they must have meant something special. (S) Drape silk around her bed. (Ark) Yes, because Faraday cage to prevent from microwaves would have such tiny little openings that there would be no air to breathe...</p>

<p>A: Scottie has the right idea.</p>

<p>Q: (L) What did Scottie say? (S) I was saying that if she&#39;s going to be in her bed, instead of mosquito netting, you have a silk netting. (Ark) No! A suit of armor like the warriors in the old times used. (L) I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very practical, dear. (laughter) (Ark) Silk is a Faraday cage. (S) Why silk? Why silk protects against these things is totally bizarre to me. (Ark) Well, it&#39;s made by animals. (L) It&#39;s made by caterpillars.</p>

<p>A: Mulberry.</p>

<p>Q: (L) That&#39;s what the caterpillars eat to make silk. (J) So _____ should take Mulberry extract? (laughter) (__<strong><em>) And Then I can start making silk? (L) If you start doing weird things, I&#39;m outta here! (laughter) (</em></strong>__) What can I do to mentally block?</p>

<p>A: Right now you need help as you are ...  weak. But the general principle can be understood from the term &quot;righteous anger.&quot;  If you think about the expression that the fate of the universe may depend on you it should make you angry.</p>

<p>Q: (L) That wasn&#39;t very clear, was it? (A****) That expression?</p>

<p>A: No. The fate of the universe can be altered negatively and many will suffer if you are out of the picture. That is what &quot;they&quot; want.</p>

<p>Q: (D) So your first priority has to be to stay healthy and make sure you take care of yourself. (S) We need to get you a superhero outfit. (_____) Made of silk! (laughter)</p>

<p>A: Each of you here tonight have a specific role to play in the coming cosmic drama. Best to always keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Q: (A*<strong><em>) Can I ask a question? (L) Yes, dear. (A</em></strong>*) What would be a good way to calm my anxiety?</p>

<p>A: Carefully avoid foods that play havoc with your system and remember that all which affects those with whom you are genetically connected can affect you also.</p>

<p>Q: (L) So you&#39;re probably getting some of what&#39;s hitting _<strong><em>. (A</em></strong>_ Oh, YOU! God, get better, would you? (laughter) (J) How much vitamin C should ____ take?</p>

<p>A: No more than 6 grams per day.</p>

<p>Q: (L) I would have said 8. (Ark) 6. (S) I thought you could take like 50 grams a day or something. (L) Well, that was when she was really sick, but she needs to stop doing that. (Ark) 6. (S) For silk, is it more important to protect the head and brain, or the body, or doesn&#39;t it matter?</p>

<p>A: Everything. And D_____ should keep a silk scarf about her throat.</p>

<p>Q: (L) Do you have any? (D) Yeah. Even in the summer though? It&#39;s hot in the summer.</p>

<p>A: Thin silk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think fighting the system is a massive misdirection from your true calling.  There are ways out of the prison, but I don&#39;t think its through fighting &#39;the guards&#39;.  They have been here for millennium and are well prepared to stay guardians.  </p>

<p>Also, your perception is another big part of it.  If you perceive yourself to be a victim then behold that is your reality.  Remember the duality of this realm - all it takes is a change of perception to see everything in a new light.  </p>

<p>Legend has it, we did once capture control from our masters...and that time was Atlantis.  Imagine yourself sitting building wonderful little cities out of Lego, and as soon as you accomplish your goal someone (much larger) comes and smashes it up.  This cycle continues to happen and you grow frustrated until it dawns on you...you don&#39;t need to build to become enlightened.  You sit quietly and meditate and the &#39;master&#39; comes along, nods in acknowledgement..&#39;you&#39;re ready to play outside&#39; he/she says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as we draw breath; as long as our hearts keep beating, there is always a chance to win.  Right now we&#39;re fighting for the hearts and minds of the populace, the true citizens of the U.S. and the world.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an uphill battle and always will be--people almost always believe &quot;credible&quot; news sources such as CNN, Fox, NBC, etc. without thinking for themselves.  I was once one of those people until my veil was lifted.</p>

<p>There is always hope and for the sake of the generation that will come after us, we must never surrender--we must fight until our bodies are shattered and our minds are torn asunder; and then we must get back up and continue fighting.</p>

<p>Our enemies are deeply entrenched and have access to virtually unlimited resources, but the will of the people is unstoppable.  One falling stone could become an avalanche, sweeping away all traces of evil and corruption beneath its righteous fury.</p>

<p>Our enemies are human beings, and human beings eventually end up making mistakes.  When our enemies make that large mistake, we will seize it to turn the tide.</p>

<p>Truth is our sword and the desire for justice is our shield.  We will become an unstoppable phalanx.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t help but agree.  Our so-called &quot;enemies&quot; who control the mass media are simply sick.  Most are afflicted with a spiritual blindness.  This makes them unconscious of their evil actions.</p>

<p>I think they have already made their mistakes.  It&#39;s too late.  They may try one last clampdown but it is doomed to fail.  The system really exists in the minds of the brainwashed, and those are mostly old geriatrics.  It&#39;s laughable actually, how pitiful it is.  Are we gonna prop up a mass of old people with life extensions just to keep their votes coming?  All it will take is a small catastrophe to thin out this herd, and that is exactly what the &#39;Old World Order&#39; does not want.  They want everything as is, forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are all here on this planet together.  That includes the slave (you) and the master (elites).  We are all human with flaws.  But the masters are sick.  They actually need our help.  They are spiritually blind.</p>

<p>This is what you need to learn through practice and confidence.  When you do you can stand up to those you consider your enemy (or those who consider you their enemy) and talk to them in a manner which will persuade them to the side of good.  See the potential in them, buried, have sympathy for their situation.  Not everyone chooses to be brainwashed, and even fewer realize that they have been.  </p>

<p>Our only way out of this mess is together.  It is actually MY/OUR/YOUR responsibility to heal these sick &quot;elites&quot; and anyone who supports them.</p>
