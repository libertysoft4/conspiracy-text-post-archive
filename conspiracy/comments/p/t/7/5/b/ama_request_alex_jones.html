<p>Along with his unique brand of fear/awakening and what he sees as the solutions to the world&#39;s conspiracies he so eloquently portrays in a unique light it will be a chance for him to present to 50,000 awakened readers about what <strong>his</strong> end game is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agree, but I also think alex jones goes a little overboard sometimes. I think it would generate more success if there was a mass movement that consisted of things that don&#39;t take a LOT of dedication to find the truth. I don&#39;t think you can slam so much outlandish truth at people and expect to do anything but throw the baby out with the bathwater. </p>

<p>people are asleep and what I&#39;m talking about is kind of like, playing a violin far enough away so that it won&#39;t wake someone up, and then walk closer and closer. gently rub their back, and whisper to them. stuff like that. </p>

<p>what I see a lot of times is the &quot;WAKE THE FUCK UPPPP!!!!!!!!&quot; method and that generally has the opposite of its intended effect. </p>

<p>I do think Alex Jones is flat out wrong about a thing or two. It&#39;s to be expected though. Nobody can be right about every single thing that they lay eyes on. I just wich the biggest spokesperson for truth was gentle and tactful for the sake of actually achieving the goal of changing people&#39;s minds. </p>

<p>In turn, that makes me sometimes wonder if Jones was placed where he is to keep people who find out the actual truth about the global elite a manageable minority by throwing out the frightening truth with conspiracy fiction in order to discredit all of it. When what your pedaling is VERY controversial facts you better make damn sure they are facts and have amazing amounts of evidence to back it up. </p>

<p>EG: 
&quot;My name is tony, I can fly, I have 25 kids, my hair grows 6 inches per month, and I can blow fire.&quot; </p>

<p>basically what that sort of thing does is make me go &quot;no you can&#39;t fly, I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t have 25 kids... you know what? I don&#39;t even care anymore. I&#39;d rather talk to someone who says things that are true instead of who knows what. Is Tony even your real name? bleh bye.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remembering that the term &quot;citizen&quot; is based off of those with birth certificates essentially being chattel (collateral) for debt, I feel as though this understanding of &quot;personhood&quot; derives from forces of cognitive dissonance that are fixated within the individual and the collective consciousness. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re referring to natural personhood, I feel that it comes from within the consciousness of the individual. If one is not conscious of their own divinity (IMHO) it becomes very difficult to witness how the reality for mankind could potentially manifest out of individuated-unity.. So, both? - depending on your definitions and syntax </p>

<p>Edit: I overlooked the word &quot;consent&quot;-- I think the Stewart brothers discuss this concept well. (their newer documentary &quot;ungrip&quot; is killer) I feel as though as individuals, we long to give up out autonomy.. This manifests collectively as a system of institutionalized control.
Edit: to be honest, I didn&#39;t follow your link, I&#39;m mobile..</p>

<p>Btw, GREAT QUESTION</p>
