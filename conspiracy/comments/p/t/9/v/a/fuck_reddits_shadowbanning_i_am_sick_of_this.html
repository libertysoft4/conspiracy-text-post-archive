    <div class="md"><p>....so EVERYONE and ANYONE who is not 100% convinced of your accuracy and credibility (even after having discussed things with you), is a paid member of the government?</p>

<p>Seriously man - take a LONG.hard.look.at.yourself. Maybe get some air. Some sunshine. Plant some food (god knows we will need it). Just stop attacking people.</p>

<p>EDIT: No one is out to get you. No one cares about what you think (mostly because they are too preoccupied with themselves) - and certainly, no one cares enough to send government agents after you, personally. Sure - agencies have a habit of employing people to do just that. But in numbers so small it is insignificant (they just don&#39;t have the funding). The chances of you coming across them are tiny. Yet you are seeing them in anyone who questions you. Be careful. The cliff of sanity is steep, high and hard to climb back up once you have fallen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t take this guy too seriously. This kind of attack is juvenile at best. Most of us are actually quite reasonable, but we have our occasional paranoid posters accusing almost everyone of being paid by some organization or another to hold their viewpoints. In reality such organizations do exist and are quite a bit larger than you might expect, but chances are most opposing voices are not those of paid shills but are in fact those of people still invested in the current system. People who would lose big time if the conspiracies were true. These are the most vocal and the most passionate critics we face and sometimes some of the smartest. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t all think everyone who opposes us is an agent of the NWO, but that does not eliminate the possibility. Chances are you are just some young guy with little political experience. But Im just guessing here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;chances are most opposing voices are not those of paid shills but are in fact those of people still invested in the current system&quot;</p>

<p>How do you calculate such chances?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you are right or wrong but simply wondering how you come to that conclusion.</p>

<p>The actually facts show it is extremely inexpensive to hire people to manipulate reddit  because people have posted the outreaches they see or receive from those trying to recruit, we know the pr organizations now recognize that reddit is the number 1 site referring  site on the internet, they know it&#39;s daily readership is the highest of any , we know billions - yes billions - of dollars are being spent by pr, lobbyist&#39;s, political &quot;institutes&quot;, etc to influence public opinion and that they target reddit (they even say so on their websites).</p>

<p>so given the immense amount of money allocated and the cheapness and importance of hiring reddit influencers, isn&#39;t it more reasonable to assume that: anytime someone takes a corporate opinion counter to widely known facts that the person is not an innocent ignorant person unaware of the truth but is in fact a paid shill on reddit?
For example everyone who paid attention now knows fukishima leaked radiation, is still leaking, it hoit America and is causing helath concerns, there are signs that the reactors are still reacting on their own in an uncontrolled fashion (elements still being released that only happen if that is still the case), and that their are huge risks that it will get far worse and affect AMerica&#39;s food supply.</p>

<p>Yet post any factual story discussing that to reddit and you will immediately get many downvotes to bury the story and most of the naysayers will be the same people who have naysayed since the first news of the accident yet their story&#39;s and replies won&#39;t have changed dispite all evidence revealed since the first news.</p>

<p>Seems to me it is MOST likely MOST of those  opposing people are industry shills - not innocent ignorant regular people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my logic. now support your opposite position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Alex Jones...gawd..my favorite part was where he claimed the &quot;elite&quot; were consuming DMT to communicate with the &quot;clockwork elves&quot; to receive evil instructions on how to enact a NWO. If you believe in demons etc - and consume DMT - your mind will destroy itself. You will have no rational way to interpret the new information regarding the universe you have unveiled to yourself. You will simply see personal demons- exclusively - and they will leave you bed ridden in shock. Luckily - I don&#39;t believe in them - so I have had more pleasant and enlightening experiences. &#39;Sif Alex Jones didn&#39;t take DMT - saw only personal demons - which led him to make such ludicrous statements.</p>

When a message comes down from above to filter some views, it will happen as quickly as fox news.  Occasionally people have a peek behind the curtain and realize the game is rigged - hence this topic.</p>

<p>Yeah, this place started out with a lot more freedom, but then something happened - it became big.  Being big costs money, and with money comes a responsibility - just not to us, <em>to the owners, and their owners</em>.</p>

<p>Most social news sites, Digg, Reddit, whatever else is out there - prefer users to link to the original source of content.  Linking to a blog which then links to the content is called <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blogspam">blogspam</a> and is pretty widely frowned upon.</p>

<p>If we want to read your article, we want to click on your submission and go to the article.  We don&#39;t want to click on your submission, go to someones blog where we can read a couple paragraphs, then click on a link there to read the full article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm that is weird then. Reason I asked is because I&#39;ve had that happen not only on reddit, but other sites, using mobile internet... due to break in coverage or whatever.</p>

<p>You probably have, but in case you haven&#39;t, check for the comment permalinks after posting and/or see if you find them when loading the page with a different device. Sorry to be captain obvious, and im not trying to imply youre paranoid, just saying.... maybe your cat, uh, walked over the backspace key while submitting. Or something.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that, though, did I? I said &quot;Comment karma was a <strong>more recent addition</strong> to Reddit.&quot;</p>

<p>If you trolls actually read what your target enemies said, you might be somewhat successful. Then again, I doubt you&#39;d know what to do with it after reading it properly.</p>

<p>Not true.</p>

<p>He probably said it with a disclaimer, like &quot;unless...&quot; Post the precise quote.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t listen at all. If you don&#39;t trust him, you shouldn&#39;t give him any ear. Here&#39;s why - those who tell you the truth 98% of the time but lie 2% of the time are VERY, VERY DANGEROUS. So if you distrust him, don&#39;t EVER watch his show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I was gonna throw in Bill Cooper too because that is the other main thing disinfo agents use to try and discredit Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Listen, just because Alex has a personal disagreement with somebody, doesn&#39;t make him a shill. Bill Cooper, much like Alex Jones, had a very important message. They mostly said the same things. Where they disagreed was tangential and not really significant in the big picture. I pretty much agree with all of what Cooper said minus the personal rant on Alex Jones.</p>

<p>I see you also brought up Jesuits. That is another target on the disinfo playlist. But you missed how Alex Jones is a Jew, his wife is a Jew, and Alex Jones is really an alien reptoid. Yeah he gets that, too.</p>

<p>By the way, <strong>don&#39;t trust reptoids.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I concur then. You are slightly mad, showing typical symptoms of someone who smokes too much cannibis in isolation from people with differing perspectives. That used to be my problem too.</p>

<p>EDIT: Not saying you are wrong - as far as I can tell by browsing, all of what you say is true (and I was already aware of them). The problem is interpretation of something&#39;s value, and the probable outcomes of such things. The government has a history of wasting money on useless projects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, well - not all lack of perspective results from smoking cannabis. Frankly most people would benefit from weekly joints. I think where we differ in opinion is where the significance of such conspiracies lie. For numerous reasons, I have learned to openly laugh at any conspiracy. Here is just one simple reason why: An industrial collapse will soon be upon us. Noone can tell when this will happen, but the best guess is sometime after fuel costs rise above $US10-12 per gallon ($AUD3 litre) for the average person. At this point, the profit margins for almost any type of entrepreneurship - including farming - become so small that it is no longer feasible. This will occur AFTER a financial collapse. A financial collapse will APPEAR to be the final consequence, but it is really just the beginning of consequences. Signs of a financial collapse are everywhere right now, but may still be quite a while away (noone knows just how robust or resilient our current systems are - its like watching someone die of massive poisoning - you know they WILL die, but it can be surprising just HOW LONG it can take them to die). </p>

<p>Anyway, my point is this: How successful do you think ANY conspiracy can be, in the face of this? True power only lies in controlling people who themselves have some limited power - hegemony over a bunch of body-lice eaters is no real power at all. They cannot work or produce anything. There is nothing to take from them. Having total control and power over every last one of the 1 million or so chimpanzees on earth will get you nowhere. The most you could hope for is managing a million strong barrage of chimp faeces all hurled in the same direction at the same time.</p>

<p>All attempts at control, are doomed to failure. And this is just ONE of the reasons why. There are many more.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>TLDR: Stop being so fucking lazy. </p>

<p>EDIT: Forgive me - I don&#39;t visit /conspiracy because there are never any posts of things I am not already aware of. Also, I got over my phase of being so self-indulgent that I could seriously consider that anyone gave a crap what I personally thought. You see, there is this thing loosely called entropy - this physical fact, results in universal conspiracies being doomed to fail. Are there &quot;evil&quot; people in the world? - yeah, sure. Are they selfless enough to be organised appropriately? - no, they are not. Is human nature bad enough to make sure we fall short of Utopia? - absolutely. Do any of the above military/intelligence projects have a chance of making any real, noticeable difference to the course of events in the wider world? Not really.</p>
