        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It says it right in my econ book about how if there is deflation then the money in our pockets is worth more. If we have more money then we have less need to work for and worry about money. But, that&#39;s not good enough for the people who profit when there is inflation and can charge more. Inflation is good for businesses because they can charge more. Deflation is bad for business because we can buy more goods with less. The government tries to keep inflation at three percent so it isn&#39;t quite as apparent that prices have doubled since 1982 (the year used for indexing). If prices doubled in a year that would be an outrage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he&#39;s just misunderstanding it.  My Macro textbook was <em>written</em> by Paul Krugman, and nowhere in it does it say that inflation is desirable for businessmen because they can &quot;charge more&quot;.  In the Keynesian model, either you&#39;re looking at the short run - where wages and prices ain&#39;t moving - or the long run - where wages and prices move, for the most part, together, with only a slight lag between prices and wages.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they let me buy fire insurance on your house. That, sir, is a recipe for disaster, and the banks brought this on themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless its gas and food that is getting more expensive. Most people can&#39;t just go without those things. Oh wait, regan made it so that that isn&#39;t measured as a part of our <em>core inflation</em>. So you never really here about it. You only see it at the gas station and at the super market.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is ok if wages decrease. All we need is enough money relative to the price of goods. Not &quot;look I have a thousand dollars but it will only be worth half that in twenty years&quot;. Of course I would want higher wages if the situation in apostrophies was the case.

    <div class="md"><p>“Inflation has now been institutionalized at a fairly constant 5% per year. This has been determined to be the optimum level for generating the most revenue without causing public alarm. A 5% devaluation applies, not only to the money earned this year, but to all that is left over from previous years. At the end of the first year, a dollar is worth 95 cents. At the end of the second year, the 95 cents is reduced again by 5%, leaving its worth at 90 cents, and so on. By the time a person has worked 20 years, the government will have confiscated 64% of every dollar he saved over those years. By the time he has worked 45 years, the hidden tax will be 90%. The government will take virtually everything a person saves over a lifetime.” - G. Edward Griffin.</p>

<p>Real wages have went <em>down</em> for the most part, however it&#39;s interesting to see them still rising from 1964 to 1973. There are two forces going on at the same time, the increase in productivity and wages, and inflation on the other hand. And inflation seems to be taking wages down despite the increase in productivity! So where does the value of the money go? It&#39;s lost to the new money, by however much new fiat money is created for government deficit financing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t count <em>commodities</em> in inflation.  They fluctuate back and forth due to factors outside of the relative purchasing power of your currency.  If you&#39;re counting oil you&#39;re doing it wrong.  There&#39;s a reason no reputable macroeconomist subscribes to this line of thought.</p>

<p><strong>Not counting something in inflation is not the same as saying it &#39;doesn&#39;t count&#39;.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call bullshit.  This is not at all the reason inflation can be desirable; inflation can be desirable because it <strong>shifts debt from creditors to debtors.</strong>  Inflation occurring right now would cause wages and prices to rise in tandem (as it does, in the long run) and the people left holding the bag would be - gasp - the bankers!  You know, those guys you all hate?  Well, the loans they made would get repaid nominally, but the money repaid would be worth far less.</p>

A 0% inflation environment would mean that you&#39;d get no raise, without a promotion, making you sad and depressed.  A very moderate inflation feels like progress.</p>

<p>Of course, wages should be based on productivity.  And the US middle class had historically gotten a larger percentage of corporate profits by generating that productivity.  However, the current CEO leadership is using a kind of TAKE_All philosophy, that is depressing working class wages.  Which is having a negative effect on US economic growth.</p>

<p>Large inflation in our country and the world happens when we inflate the dollar.  The only way to inflate currency is by making more of it.  </p>

<p>............................
However, you are correct, inflation is desirable, to the .1% on top that can afford it.  Because they own all the money.  So to make people struggle forces those people to work harder for less, thus creating more profit.
...........................
&quot;The government tries to keep inflation at 3 percent&quot; ... where are you getting your magic info from.  I swear to god if it is that text book, burn it.  In the last 3 years we have inflated the dollar 20%.  Fancy that.</p>

<p>You might want to brush up on your econ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like how you are taking an econ class, probably for the first time, and probably entry level, and are suddenly talking like you are an economics expert and downplaying others economic knowledge. That&#39;s cute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inflation is a good thing if you are selling</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also a good thing for debts. Wages generally rise behind inflation, which means debts can be easier to pay off, or at least keep pace. If the currency and economy deflate, wages drop, and debts become larger and harder to pay off.</p>

<p>A small amount of inflation is good for any growing and healthy economy. If you think otherwise, you need to keep your mouth shut until you take <em>more</em> economics classes and get out of the 101 level classes. Deflation is what caused The Great Depression, and arguably our recent recession where we saw some brief deflation at the start.</p>

<p>You are not an expert on economics because you opened an econ book for the first time in your life. Get over yourself.</p>
