        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am Ambiversive&#39;s ex-girlfriend. We were together for nine months in 2007 and also back together these past two months until he broke up with me 2 weeks ago via email and I never saw him again. I knew he was depressed but I had no idea how serious it was. In 2007 we did fight about the amount of time he spent alone on the computer but this time around we didn&#39;t. He also didn&#39;t have a lot of friends and I believe I am the only one his parents called. But I know he spent a lot of time here. He would have turned 30 in six weeks. I wanted you all to know. He was a trained programmer and we have lost his gifts. I don&#39;t think I understood the full extent of his talent in engineering because my degrees are in social science. In the summer he was also a common sight downtown where he would sell people drawings he did and spend a lot of time talking to whoever passed by. He suffered from bipolar disorder and my last attempt to get him to go to therapy was met with derision. Still he was a playful, fun-loving guy, extremely aware of his words and actions but with rapidly declining self-esteem through the years. So please if you are feeling depressed seek help and talk to the people around you. Don&#39;t be afriad to get help for your depressed friends as well. thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh Jesus, I am so sorry he did that. Although I&#39;ve seen some conflicts between him and other parties, he was not an evil guy and he was sincere in his posts and he did have an inquiring attitude towards the world. I know some of his posts showed that open and explorative attitude.</p>

<p>I urge anyone who suffers from depression to talk with other people when and if things get bad, you&#39;re not alone, not everything is hopeless. If someone has been hit with a disorder, sometimes there are drugs that can stabilize a person and level out ups and downs.</p>

<p>In memory of Ambiversive.</p>

If you see his folks again you can tell them he had some friends on here who considered him a good guy who cared enough about this community to do some volunteer work moderating material here.</p>

<p>As for hiding, yes. My ex had multiple personality disorder and was very good at hiding things. So it&#39;s not always easy to know the depths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been reflecting on this deeply all day because in the last week, in my professional life, I was able to talk two people down; one threatening and one despondent. Sometimes it is to end the pain and sometimes it is overwhelming despair. Why should anyone continue to remain conscious of only suffering or to continue to feel alone and hopeless just because that isn&#39;t true for us? I cannot express this paradox anymore clearly: on the one hand we want to respect a person&#39;s decision to live his life and end it how he chooses; on the other we want to intervene (and make promises we know we may not be able to keep).</p>

<p>He will be missed here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss and thank you for your post. Depression is a terrible burden to those who experience it, and their loved ones. It&#39;s like an impenetrable wall for many, choosing to dwell and bottle things up inside, it slowly eats away at you day by day. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Ambiversive had made his own peace and taken much time to consider his actions and ultimately his final decision to move on. Try and take strength from that if you can, it was his wish to go. Suicide is like a bomb under the kitchen table, no one expects it, totally devastating for the family. </p>

<p>Many young men commit suicide, more than ever it would seem. The burdens of this world weighs heavy on the minds of those who are aware, myself included, i have taken strength from your story as i too have severe bouts of depression and it has indeed cost me many friends and relationships - including my own daughter. So it perpetuates, the depression leads to isolation that in turn causes deeper set problems, regret and lament. </p>

<p>I do not doubt that something remains after our deaths, a part of us moves on, having fed upon this mortal, limited life our souls grow eternal towards the endless light. Like rain falling to the ocean we are all one and everything is connected. The mansion of eternity has many rooms, never doubt you will see his face again. </p>

<p>Nothing is lost and no one is left behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you. This has left people here shocked and in disbelief, wondering how he could have believed that was his only option left. My Mom and I think if he had waited even a few days, his outlook would have improved. He really wanted a cat and I was about to get him one as a surprise. Now I&#39;m never going to know how the cat would have improved his outlook on life and I think this is going to stay with me for a long time. I think for socially isolated people pets can be very helpful so you should consider one if you have gone through depression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. By any chance was he unemployed or uninsured? </p>

<p>I knew a talented guy with Bi Polar disorder who was hospitalized three times within a year and ended up losing his job. After losing his job he lost his insurance. The company has since gone out of business. Then he was bankrupted by the cost of treatment. Last I heard this all led to a divorce. What a mess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this my fellow conspirators is why I preach tolerance, understanding and forgiveness. So often we talk badly to one another here and we rely on the fact that the person you are talking to can handle it. I have even had people say things here on reddit that really made me feel terrible about myself because I knew what they were saying was true. I had some changes to make to myself if I ever wanted to be able to really happy with me. I have been able to successfully go through this on my own, but that makes me one of the lucky ones. My encounters with ambiversive were adversarial at times, and in hindsight I probably was not as nice to him as I should have been. I regret this so much. In a way this makes me feel slightly responsible. Not directly of course, but in an indirect way. I feel like a real asshole now. I never knew he was this unstable or I never would have thought about talking badly to him. I had to say this because I really feel awful about contributing to the depression and anxiety that led to him taking his own life. He never deserved this. From now on I will redouble my efforts to be kind to everyone here and to give compassion like never before. We are a community here and we need to look after one another. </p>

<p>If anyone here ever feels like suicide is the right option, please shoot me a pm. I will be happy to talk. Just please, talk to someone before you attempt anything. You might not live to regret it if you don&#39;t. No one dies on my watch because they feel like no one cares. I care. I really really do. You are my brothers and sisters. Losing any of you is like losing a friend. I am really sad now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as a person spreading the truth about these criminals for close to 5 years, know that we understand any aggression we receive. Most of us struggled hard against the truth when we began to awaken. Its a natural process, 1st they ignore you, next they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. But to get a person to go from laugh to fight, is the same as convincing a person to put their hand into a fire. The &#39;extreme change&#39; in perceived reality causes a response of &quot;fear/pain&quot;. I do not believe I ever had the pleasure of talking to ambiverse, but I&#39;m sure he took the things you may have said as the &quot;fighting&quot; process was going well, and even happy to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little different than that. We got along on issues involving our political ideals and such, it was his moderation style here that was our main point of contention. If he had retained his mod position he might have stuck around. My main point here was that I contributed to his sorrow by making a stink about his style of running things, and I am sorry that I did. I wasn&#39;t the only one, but I was part of a crowd that ultimately stripped him of his modship and maybe contributed to his suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I am not blaming myself, because ultimately this was his decision. But if I had more compassion for his suffering maybe things would have been different. I&#39;m so sorry amibiversive. I never meant to push you if I did. =(</p>

<p>We all get depressed, I have been rather depressed lately, but taking ones life is a serious and very sad thing to do.</p>

<p>I have children and a loving family - and so even when I feel bleak, I cannot let it get to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is real - then how fucking terrible I am so sorry. We had many disagreements recently over his modship and layout changes. I can&#39;t help but think that I was a link in this tragic chain of events even if it was never personal. As someone around the same age who has been through some shit I really wish we could have talked more. Once again, that&#39;s if this is real and not an elaborate psyop.</p>

<p>Even though he was a bad moderator, he was a smart guy and a valued contributor to ours, and the greater human community at large. He knew more about permaculture than almost anyone I&#39;ve met IRL or online. If this really happened, it&#39;s tragic losing someone with that kind of knowledge and passion. There just aren&#39;t enough of them out there.</p>

<p>edit - It&#39;s either this story is true or that this has all been a psyop perpetrated on us. I hate to think it but it&#39;s a definite possibility considering you&#39;ve given us no name, city, obit, other proof. It&#39;s hard for me to decide. Call me cold-blooded and if I&#39;m wrong then I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m an asshole- my condolences were real. But I&#39;m unable to decide how to feel with so little verifiable information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i had a similar thing happen to me a couple of years ago. She also stole my guitar that I used to record with (2 years later and I STILL can&#39;t afford to replace it. There goes my artistic outlet for depression as well). My friends weren&#39;t there for me at all and I ended up practically living outdoors for almost a year. I was living with the girl and I had no income at the time and nowhere to go. No one to depend on. I thought about suicide occasionally, but every time the thoughts crept up on me I told myself I was stronger than that. And I was. I eventually gave up. On everyone. This may sound depressing, but in the end it helped me to learn to rely on myself and no one else. I have also learned a valuable skill. The ability to make myself numb to emotional pain. In the end our story is similar, except I had no one to depend on. I had to make my own way back and it sucked. </p>

<p>This is the first time I&#39;ve come across something like this where I &quot;knew&quot; (read) what a person thought and felt about that believed in similar things, or at least had a similar mindset to question reality and wonder what the fuck is actually going on.</p>

<p>RIP Ambiversive.</p>

<p>And lolcats_cradle, thanks for taking the time to post this.  If there is any afterlife, I&#39;m sure he appreciates it.  If not, the community does.  When I pass on, I hope someone like you takes the time to notify people I know what went down, or to offer any sort of solace as to how or why anything happened.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been feeling rather down lately too, perhaps it comes with realizing the real world view and how much wrong there is going on.</p>

<p>Since this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I will ask you this - you are sure that it was suicide and not that he found/spread some information which someone didn&#39;t like? Impossible to know I guess, and maybe far-fetched. Just wanted to ask.</p>

<p>His last post...</p>

<hr/>

<p>Anonymous is a police/military intelligence operation designed to attract hacktivists and incriminate them by association. It is composed of two parts, the &#39;attracting&#39; part, which, on the surface, appears to assist the cause of truth by releasing hidden information, and the &#39;incriminating&#39; part, which appears to attack police, military, or governmental organizations. However, when they release information they are only releasing what the powers that be want released, and when they attack they do so only for appearances.</p>

<p>Consider the Guy Fawkes mask, a symbol of explosive violence. Consider the massive corporate funding behind making it a recognizable image. Consider their catchphrase &#39;We are legion.&#39; which is straight out of the Bible (from the mouths of demons). Consider the so-called &#39;leaderless&#39; nature, which allows for anyone to claim to &#39;be&#39; a part of the group. Consider the escalation of targets, first it was Scientology, which attracted many, and then recently it is police departments worldwide? Also they are planning to &#39;take down&#39; the Internet? Is this what a free-speech oriented organization would do?</p>

<p>It is widely known that the voting on reddit is manipulated by the powers that be, so if you want the truth on Anonymous, look no further than the most downvoted posts in the threads about them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>They got to him!</p>
