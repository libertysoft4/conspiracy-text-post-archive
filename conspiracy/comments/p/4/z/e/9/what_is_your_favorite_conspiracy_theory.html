    <div class="md"><p>Mine are a toss up. There&#39;s always the JFK/RFK assassinations, the moon landing, 9/11, and DIA. However, the one that always gets me going is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwEkpB4feN0">John Rockefeller&#39;s quest to control the oil industry</a>. The conspiracy theory is that every war that the US has been involved in since WWI was a strategic move on the part of the Rockefellers to gain further control of the world&#39;s oil. They have also sought to ensure the world&#39;s dependency on oil - which is why we have cars on the road in 2012 that actually get worse mileage than cars developed in the 1930&#39;s and 1940&#39;s as well as the lack of technological advancements to steer us away from oil.</p>

<p>A lot of folks do seem to  go a bit nuts, but I think it&#39;s the nature of the conspiracy beast.  Can&#39;t blame them really, it&#39;s exciting and hard to keep a tight grip on things that are shadowy to begin with.

    <div class="md"><p>I totally understand. Some conspiracies I believe (9/11) some I&#39;m on the fence about (government knowledge of extraterrestrials, area 51, etc) and some I have written off as complete nonsense (Illuminati, musicians selling soul to the devil, moon landing hoax). But I can respect that you are actually looking at both sides and not just pointing fingers at the big evil government.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t blame them, once you see some discrepancies in one conspiracy it&#39;s a slippery slope and it&#39;s very easy to just start believing all the conspiracies out there without examing BOTH sides of evidence. If someone comes to a conclusion based on evidence, great. But when people start citing their only evidence as &quot;the government is out to get us man&quot; or &quot;they lied about this so they MUST be lying about this too&quot;. </p>

<p>As someone who has a dual major, with one part being Philosophy, it is critical for me to see that people aren&#39;t using logical fallacies to support their claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between leaving the earths protective magnetic field and going into space. All of the space shuttle and soyuz missions have been in low earth orbit and within the earth magnetic field. As you leave the earths magnetic field you start to run into the Van Allen radiation belts which would quickly kill a person unless very very thick lead shielding was used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It took Apollo only about an hour to pass through the worst part of the radiation belts - once on the outbound trip and once again on the return trip. The total radiation dose received by the astronauts was about one rem. A person will experience radiation sickness with a dose of 100-200 rem, and death with a dose of 300+ rem. Clearly the doses received fall well below anything that could be considered a significant risk. Despite claims that &quot;lead shielding meters thick would have been needed&quot;, NASA found it unnecessary to provide any special radiation shielding.</p>

<p>The hoax advocates also make the mistake of limiting themselves to two-dimensional thinking. The Van Allen Radiation Belts consist of a doughnut-shaped region centered on Earth&#39;s magnetic equator. The translunar trajectories followed by the Apollo spacecraft were typically inclined about 30 degrees to Earth&#39;s equator, therefore Apollo bypassed all but the edges of the radiation belts, greatly reducing the exposure. </p>

<p>As far as people who tracked the moon landing that aren&#39;t part of the government here is some for just apollo 11:</p>

<pre><code>The Bochum Observatory director (Professor Heinz Kaminski) was able to provide confirmation of events and data independent of both the Russian and U.S. space agencies.[30]

A compilation of sightings appeared in &quot;Observations of Apollo 11&quot; in Sky and Telescope magazine, November 1969, pp. 358–359.

The Madrid Apollo Station, part of the Deep Space Network, built in Fresnedillas, near Madrid, Spain tracked Apollo 11.[31]

Goldstone Tracking Station in California tracked Apollo 11.[32]

At Jodrell Bank Observatory in the UK, the telescope was used to observe the mission, as it was used years previously for Sputnik.[33] At the same time, Jodrell Bank scientists were tracking the unmanned Soviet spacecraft Luna 15, which was trying to land on the Moon.[34] In July 2009, Jodrell released some recordings they made.[35]

Larry Baysinger, a technician for WHAS radio in Louisville, Kentucky, independently detected and recorded transmissions between Apollo 11 astronauts on the lunar surface and in the command module.[36] Recordings made by Baysinger share certain characteristics with recordings made at Bochum Observatory by Heinz Kaminski (see above), in that both Kaminski&#39;s and Baysinger&#39;s recordings do not include the capsule communicator in Houston and the associated Quindar tones heard in NASA audio and seen on NASA Apollo 11 transcripts. Kaminski and Baysinger could only hear the transmissions from the Moon, and not transmissions to the Moon from the earth.

<p>A total of 382 kilograms (842 lb) of Moon rocks and dust were collected during the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 missions.[1] Some 10 kg (22 lb) of the Moon rocks have been destroyed during hundreds of experiments performed by both NASA researchers and planetary scientists at research institutions unaffiliated with NASA. These experiments have confirmed the age and origin of the rocks as lunar, and were used to identify lunar meteorites collected later from Antarctica.[2] The oldest Moon rocks are up to 4.5 billion years old,[1] making them 200 million years older than the oldest Earth rocks, which are from the Hadean eon and dated 3.8 to 4.3 billion years ago. The rocks returned by Apollo are very close in composition to the samples returned by the independent Soviet Luna programme.[3] A rock brought back by Apollo 17 was accurately dated to be 4.417 billion years old, with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 million years. The test was done by a group of researchers headed by Alexander Nemchin at Curtin University of Technology in Bentley, Australia.[4]</p>

<p>Where do you get &quot;petrified wood&quot; from? You keep asking questions but you&#39;ve yet to point toward ONE piece of evidence that the landing was faked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why do you need evidence to show that the moon landing was not real? that is the same as asking an atheist to provide evidence for no god. it sucks that a people believed in such fantasy, myself included. ah yes, another &quot;source&quot; from the medium. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</a> puts all media in question. </p>

<p>gold is petrified sunshine. I used my scrying mirror to determine the age of each speck of gold. believe me? no? there is no way you can verify what I said because you have zero idea how to use a scrying mirror and have zero idea what you are looking at. the same thing can be said of moon rocks (which by the way, one does not need to go to the moon to get, they are here on earth, along with rocks from mars)
so to be honest having a moon rock proves nothing. i wonder if I still have my &quot;moon rock&quot; that was bought for me back in the day. </p>

<p>thats right i am asking questions. it doesnt mean i beleive it was a hoax. but the lack of evidence, scientific verifiable data, indicates to me that this was one big mind fuck. why? there is no telling why nazis do what they do. we are moths the moon landing was the porch light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is when an atheist is asked why he/she doesn&#39;t believe in god they are able to point out reasons why they don&#39;t. Like I said, you are just rambling in a nonsensical way that is very paranoid in nature. You aren&#39;t taking an objective and critical view on the situation. You accuse me of already having my mind made up when you are doing the same thing.</p>

<p>I ask for proof the moon landing was a hoax because otherwise you are just going based on faith. And as an atheist you know that faith isn&#39;t a good reason to believe in something. </p>

<p>And why are you bringing up Nazis? Are you implying everyone involved in the moon landing and the space program is a Nazi?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is the if then argument, that i portrayed to demonstrate your logical fallacy. i dont think you are comprehending anything i am saying.</p>

<p>because the only thing that can be attested to is that there are images on tv that have convinced people that we have landed on the moon.
you want me to take your side of things because you simply cannot wrap your mind around the possibility of deception. for you, it takes a greater leap of faith to believe it to be a hoax. I completely understand this viewpoint. For me it is easier for me to be sceptical since there is no independent verifiable data, which is required in science if one is to further investigate phenomena. </p>

if you had read one of my many replies that i had believed it to be fact as well. i have read from many &quot;authorities&quot; about the moon landing. but talking about it doesn&#39;t make it so. it only reinforces the idea but doesn&#39;t indicate hard evidence. that&#39;s the thing, there is no way to independently verify the moon landing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how so? tell me my logical fallacies? that i don&#39;t believe in what the tv tells me? my parents talked about the moon landing as if they witnessed it first hand. they didn&#39;t witness it first hand. 
so if the tv shows you a man bouncing up and down on a set and the populace trust and believe, have faith in their medium and govt, then that equals a moon landing? because the reality is this; there are videos of men in space suits shown bouncing (maybe slowed tape) and a medium to propagate this image. seeing is believing and many people have no inkling to question what is presented to them by the authority that rules them.  most people do not have the mind frame of their rulers. the belief of humans and a tv image. that&#39;s all we have 
to &quot;prove&quot; we had man on the moon.

    <div class="md"><p>but you are believing what the tv tells you. you do accept what nasa tells you w/o question. most people do because they have no understanding of the matter. that is very relevant to this discussion. if you dont trust the source of information how do you expect to accept it as truth? i know that science and politics are closely linked. just wait and see.
you are in college you will see.
learning is never a waste. you do not need to attend a university to learn. </p>

<p>entertain the idea that it was a hoax. you will probably end up in the agnostic area (where i am at) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is one I&#39;m finding I agree with.  We simply don&#39;t know much about what, how  and why the ancients did what they did.  I&#39;ve actually heard that Egyptian sources about their Kings Dynasty and Lineage (it went back much farther in history than our models allowed) was just ignored because it didn&#39;t work.  Simply, we think we know more about the Egyptians than the Egyptians knew about themselves.</p>

<p>Humans have been around for a long time.  If shit hit the fan here and now, what do we think would be left of our world in even a few thousand years?  We don&#39;t inscribe much of anything on rocks, it&#39;s all intangible data on computers.  Our books won&#39;t last long.  Our common house made of wood, gone.  Nature reclaims it all when we stop upkeep.</p>

<p>And we just keep getting new information that refuses to fit in our models.  We are going to have to admit we just don&#39;t have enough data.  Gobekli Tepe is a neat example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the quake that created the Tsunami in Japan last year was supposedly man made as well.  Japan wasn&#39;t playing with the Black Hats, so they detonated a bomb on a fault line of the coast of japan.  </p>

<p>It is interesting because these quakes, Japan, Virginia, and Colorado all  had unusually shallow points of activity.  They also didn&#39;t have a P wave which natural quakes MUST have by their nature.</p>

<p>Pretty intriguing but I can&#39;t verify this as much as I want to.  It is a hopeful conspiracy however, to think that an equally powerful group of humans are fighting for us.  I wish them luck if they truly are and would love to help in anyway possible!</p>

<p>I recently saw a video of him saying we need to just rise up and detain or kill those who are behind the current state of affairs.  I wonder why his white hat group doesn&#39;t take action?  Surely they have more power and direction than the current divided-and-conquered people?</p>

<p>I got a similar impression, except my impression was a little more leaning toward mockery and ridicule. Read the first paragraph again. He set up HAARP to be ridiculed via a disjointed connecting of leaps of conjecture, then landing on &quot;mole people&quot; (which he mocks in the first paragraph, and then lauds in the second). Aufbruch is trolling this thread... and got upvoted for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna have to go with ultrasonic mind control or whatever you want to call it, because it&#39;s both far-out and plausible.</p>

<p>Decades old: two ultrasonic transducers of high power and precision can be directed at a target. When they are properly aimed and tuned, the interference can be in the audible and or tactile range. This can be used to create sounds audible only to the target, as well as tap-like sensations only they can feel.</p>

<p>Fast forward to ~ a decade ago: Sony patented a similar device, except it was discovered that with precise tuning/aim such a device can also be used to stimulate individual/small clusters of neurons. I don&#39;t know where the actual brain-mapping is now; it varies from person to person, and sometimes drastically so. But a few years from now or now, this device or some other similar incarnation could serve as a useful &quot;neural input&quot; device. Or a potent mind-control device. I don&#39;t think the software/brain atlas is there yet, personally, but hey, it&#39;s a conspiracy theory, so who knows.</p>

<p>Just google the shit, plenty of quacks out there who will pour their hearts out about it. And there is a Sony patent (<a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=kXgQAAAAEBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA7&amp;amp;dq=sony+ultrasonic+neural&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=f6soT6-VLvG30AGQo5SnAg&amp;amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">Google Patents</a>).

<p>That a group of investors (the ones who basically kept MJ solvent in the last year or so of his life) had him killed for access to his massive catalog and such.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles%202008/papin_steam_engine.pdf">Denis Papin Steam Engine, Circa 1690</a>. </p>

<p>In reviewing the original documents—the correspondence of Leibniz and Papin and the Royal Society papers—one cannot help but think of today&#39;s antiscience faction and their determination to implement a new Malthusian order by stopping technological development and theoretical science. In this case, a 100-year delay in the implementation of fusion power and full nuclear development would have devastating consequences for mankind. What America needs now is enough 20th-century XXXXXX XXXXX and Robert Fultons to get rid of the obstructors of progress for good.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In 1690, Papin published an historic article in the Acta
Eruditorum of Leipsig, &quot;A New Method of Obtaining Very
Great Moving Powers at Small Cost &quot; from which we can
precisely date the beginning of the Steam Age. Here, for
the first time, Papin proposed using the power of expand-
ing steam to operate an engine. In the new invention,
steam replaced the gunpowder charge of Huygens&#39;s cylin-
der, creating a more complete vacuum under the piston
and thereby taking advantage of the full force of atmos-
pheric pressure (Figure 4).</p>

<p>Papin&#39;s concept was appropriated in toto in the Newcomen
engine more than 20 years later. However, although
Papin mentioned in passing the utility of his invention to
&quot;draw water or ore from mines,&quot; the article featured a
lengthy and detailed discussion of the application of steam
power to propellirig ships equipped with paddlewheels</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Savery Hoax</p>

<p>Despite the publicity given to Papin&#39;s invention, the
British Parliament awarded an exclusive patent for &quot;Rais-
ing Water by the Impellent Force of Fire&quot; to one Thomas
Savery, variously described as a &quot;sea captain&quot; and a &quot;mili-
tary engineer.&quot; The terms of the patent meant that any
steam-powered device Papin might invent in England would
come under the control of Savery.</p>

<p>Although news of Savery&#39;s patent reached Germany by
1699, it was not until 1704 that Leibniz, via &quot;Hanoverian
envoys&quot; in London, was able to acquire some sort of
description of Savery&#39;s device. Leibniz forwarded a sketch
of the English &quot;engine&quot; to Papin, along with an evaluation
of its capabilities. Based on further intelligence reports
from his envoys, Leibniz concluded—correctly—that Sav-
ery&#39;s device did not work in full size.</p>

<p>1708-1712: The Royal Society appropriates Papin&#39;sresearches without remuneration.</p>

<p>1712: Papin &quot;disappears.&quot; The first Newcomen engine, limited to pumpingwater from flooded mines, is erected</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The better conspiracy is the <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> one: </p>

<p>That a group of investors (the ones who basically kept MJ solvent in the last year or so of his life) had him killed for access to his massive catalog and such.  They knew he&#39;d never be able to complete the 50+ dates of his tour and so they paid the Doctor (Dr. Conrad Murry) to kill him with the understanding that he does a shit-bit of jail time, never practices medicine again but he and his family are &#39;taken care of&#39; for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Look at how quickly Michael&#39;s name has been thrown to the commercial wolves since he died.  Suddenly his music is being licensed everywhere (he was pretty strict about how the music he owned was used and licensing was rare, if at all).  Some of the Jacksons were pissed at the time, but they&#39;ve all been happily paid into silence.  His kids are taken care of, but they don&#39;t even own their dad&#39;s music, the investors do.</p>

<p>TL;DR a small group of people made a shit-load of money <strong>very fast</strong> off of Michael Jackson&#39;s Death.</p>
