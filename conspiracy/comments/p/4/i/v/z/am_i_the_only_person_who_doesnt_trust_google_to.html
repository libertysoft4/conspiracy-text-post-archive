    <div class="md"><p>Google had admitted to tailoring results specific to a person searches and websites they visit. The aim is to get more content to you that match your interest. In some cases, such as politics, if a person is a republican and regularly searches for specific content then the content they receive will be tailored to what they are looking for. The thing is there is no variation of perspectives being delivered, instead google offer what you want to see instead of what you should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t necessarily bad I would rather Google gave us more tools to search according to our interests. I remember when I searched Google only 3 years ago and could find absolutely zero items on continental philosophical theory. Now I can find TONS of stuff in that area even when I&#39;m not looking and it&#39;s obvious that my results have been tailored that way. The problem isn&#39;t when you have results ordered according to a certain pattern the problem is when that pattern is biased toward you not seeing certain information such as information that criticizes a certain corporation or you simply can&#39;t see any info at all since you&#39;ve checked every available link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google providing tools to search our interests isn&#39;t the problem. A functioning Google is able to do that. What becomes a problem is when Google essentially creates a bubble of information pertaining exclusively around what you search and browse on the web. Personally this is completely antithetical to what the internet is about. Information should be available freely with no bias on perspective or rhetoric. It should simply be a form of information delivery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair Google is not in the business to decide what you or anyone else &quot;should&quot; read, only the content that you are interested.  In fact it would be a very bad thing if Google was in the business of offering you what it thinks you &quot;should&quot; see because that most likely would not be the same as what you, RZA1M, think people &quot;should&quot; see.  Anyways if you want to visit Bigbobsnewworldorderreport.com or any other conspiracy related blog then Google isnt going to stop you, there are plenty of those sorts of sites on the internet and Google doesnt give a shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The results i&#39;m getting from that search DO in fact seem very different and that is comparing a search where Google gave me every available result. Having the logo of the sites on the links is a nice touch. However it doesn&#39;t tell me how many results I get, I don&#39;t think. Not that Google has ever been straight forward with it&#39;s search estimates. Often it tells me I have 300,000 results when in fact I only have 800 results.</p>

Facebook also keep this information, although its acquisition is limited to page views within Facebook. <strong>This data is valuable for authorities, advertisers and others interested in profiling users</strong>, trends and web site marketing performance. Google, Facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive, making it more valuable.</p>

An IP address and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.[10] <strong>Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service</strong>, in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and later in the same article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The Department of Homeland Security has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies for augmenting the profiles of individuals that it is monitoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, maybe it doesn&#39;t respond to whether or not they are censoring, but it gives you a pretty good idea of what they are already doing that should piss people off. Also,... you&#39;ve probably seen <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MvPKC.png">this disclaimer</a> at some point of your life... there you go. I guess they are supposed to tell you when it&#39;s copyright-related, but I&#39;m pretty sure if they do it in China, they do it in other places too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should have been doing that in the first place. But you need a very high encryption standard like BLOWFISH, which surpasses the NSA specs. I prefer BLOWFISH for very sensitive data (personal records, identifiable information, private documents, etc.) and routinely wipe my drives using the Guttman algorithm. Look up those two in wiki, and also look up Tor at torproject.org for more internet security advice. And you might want to stock up on books that deal with digital forensics and penetration testing for more information. So many resources I could give you, and tips, but just not enough time on my end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People think that the only censorship is &quot;government&#39; censorship. It doesn&#39;t occur to them that corporations have an interest in censorship and that they have the power to censor. It also doesn&#39;t occur to them that the state department and corporations can collude to promote their interests. Alas Google may feel they aren&#39;t doing anything wrong or illegal since they aren&#39;t censoring as a government entity. But they are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I suspect though that publicly owned corporations are more likely to be involved in top down censorship campaigns since the various owners have both the incentive and the power of working together in a collusive manner against the public.  Privately owned corporations are more likely to think in terms of their immediate bottom or their own individual values. That isn&#39;t to say that they can&#39;t engage and collude or that the corporate world isn&#39;t so interconnected that sometimes they have no choice but to be a player. For example &quot;independent&quot; newspapers will sometimes have to supplement the salaries of their journalists by providing them with &quot;consulting jobs&quot; with corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and I don&#39;t know enough about SEO to know if that is possible. Maybe it is and there already is a search engine like that and I&#39;m missing out on something big. I&#39;m not completely sold on DuckDuckGo but I still need to try it out for a while. I do know that their are certain patterns that I see in search engines that make me suspicious and people can share that experience. For me a big piece of evidence that confirms my suspicion that Google isn&#39;t being straightforward is how even when I get a small number of search results it always seems to be from the same handful of pages. It seems unlikely that a small number of websites that I see all the time in Google search results would contain so many keywords that only those websites appear and a mere handful of other websites</p>

I think that Google believes that it&#39;s duty and role within society as a publicly owned corporation right now is to serve the interests of it&#39;s shareholders and promote business in general. Sadly it doesn&#39;t grasp it&#39;s role of providing and freeing information or promoting democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol why the fuck not? If they can get away with it across international lines, why wouldn&#39;t they do the same with domestic firms? I highly doubt backing Monsanto&#39;s crops through extortion, leading to mass monoculture, is in &quot;the public&#39;s&quot; interests, let alone other nations&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying that if the government&#39;s going so unethically about pushing one company&#39;s (Monsanto&#39;s) agenda (which does not benefit its citizens), then they&#39;ll do the same domestically, also not benefiting citizens (by, say, passing some legislation that would destroy google, or launching more antitrust investigations).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmmm. I agree. It makes a lot more sense when you explain it that way. I was only thinking about Google conspiring with a rogue sector of Government , the NSA, for technological advantages but you are probably right that the fear of the DOJ and the FTC probably have a lot to do with it as well. And when I say your probably right I mean that I look at it in a completely different way because of what you said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk the details but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s working the other way, or somewhere in between. The NSA is prolly paying google for use of their technology/hardware/data/services (and google is like the eye in the sky; they track everything) to enhance their whatever they do, or sharing data or whatever. But I&#39;m guessing the money&#39;s flowing in google&#39;s direction.</p>

<p>No problem, like your username by the way, go skepticism!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. DuckDuckGo actually does seem be uncensored compared to Google. I tried typing the search string &quot;paid to comment&quot; on Google and found almost zero critical commentary on the subject. But when I typed the same search string with DuckDuckGo I&#39;ve found quite a bit that was critical. So at least so far I am please with DuckDuckGo.</p>
