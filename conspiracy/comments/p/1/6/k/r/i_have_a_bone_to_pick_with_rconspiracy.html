Anytime someone makes a comment or submits a link thats opaquely antisemitic people will always chime in and try to excuse it by claiming; &#39;You must have meant to say Zionists, not Jews&#39;. Or that person will be dismissed altogether as being a Zionist posing as an antisemite to make conspiracy theorists look bad. Basically its impossible for anyone who browses this subreddit to be legitimately dislike Jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize how much it bothered me until I mentioned to a Jewish friend/coworker that I&#39;m a moderator here, and he&#39;s a redditor.  I imagine him coming by on one of the &quot;bad days&quot; where the front page here is plastered with story after story about &quot;Jewish bankers and their Zionist agenda&quot; or some such.</p>

<p>I LOVE conspiracy and conspiracy theories, and agree that all governments are likely involved in many.  Also, I agree that there are certainly secret societies pulling strings, including Zionists and many many more.  Some days, it feels like disproportionate attention and negativity are directed at Zionist conspiracies, some of which I can imagine could be viewed as thinly veiled racism or anti-antisemitism.  Maybe I&#39;m being overly sensitive.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any suggestions at the moment for how we (as mods) could better manage this issue.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Is it just me picking up on this?  Maybe we need to open a discussion with the community, if for no other reason to get our thumb on the pulse and know what the broader opinions are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel as though Zionists are using America to the point of our own destruction for Israels ill gotten gains, and I have a passion for our constitutional freedoms which Jews often threaten. I believe they are the perpetrators of many false flag events, as they are just too small to wage the type of large scale war they want. If money truly runs the world, then so do the Zionists. IMHO, there isn&#39;t a greater threat to the peace and prosperity of the entire world. </p>

<p>Just look at how they&#39;re trying to get us into a war with Iran. The Zionists are practically foaming at the mouths with Iranian blood lust. They could care less if they drove the US/CHINA/RUSSIA/IRAN/EUROPE into a third world war. So long as the Jews survived, they&#39;d just move in after we all incinerated one another...</p>

It&#39;s like saying if you&#39;re against radicals like the Taliban, you are against all Muslims, which is a false assumption. Much of the perceived Antisemitism is due to the preconceived notion that any attack on any Jewish person that involves their belief (even Zionism) is then redirected and called an Antisemite attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a quote about jews disproportionate influence in society:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What soon gave me cause for very serious consideration were the activities of the Jews 
in certain branches of life, into the mystery of which I penetrated little by little. Was 
there any shady undertaking, any form of foulness, especially in cultural life, in which 
at least one Jew did not participate? On putting the probing knife carefully to that kind 
of abscess one immediately discovered, like a maggot in a putrescent body, a little Jew 
who was often blinded by the sudden light. 
In my eyes the charge against Judaism became a grave one the moment I discovered the 
Jewish activities in the Press, in art, in literature and the theatre. All unctuous protests were now more or less futile. One needed only to look at the posters announcing the 
hideous productions of the cinema and theatre, and study the names of the authors who 
were highly lauded there in order to become permanently adamant on Jewish 
questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds familiar? It does, doesn&#39;t it. It&#39;s from Adolf Hitler in &quot;Mein kampf&quot;. Spare me any godwins law you&#39;re already thinking of typing out. This is not &quot;like hitler would&#39;ve said&quot; - this <strong>IS</strong> what hitler said. He had the same conspiracy theories about jewish influence in the media and culture as many in this subreddit has.</p>

<p>I hope at least some of you care about this. I know many of you don&#39;t and deep down think that hitler was right about the jews. </p>

I was surprised reading a part of mein kampf were hitler actually talks about being a cosmopolitan and feeling unease about the antisemitism he sees around him.

I feel pretty embarrassed myself sometimes and sometimes I feel that I have to defend all of us as a group for something nasty that one person here says about Jews or Israel. The real problem here is that we have the zionists commuting international crimes on a massive scale in order to bankrupt all nations and begin a world currency. Im sure you know this already, but this is the only reason it hits the front page every day. When people see things in this light it can become easier to distinguish between the two. Most americans cant tell the difference between a Chinese man and a Japanese man, so to expect people to be able to distinguish between the two without education on the subject is nearly impossible. </p>

<p>John Stewart, Jew</p>

<p>I think this website may have been getting a bit scary for some people in high places, and they wanted to shine a light into this corner.</p>

<p>Since then, every Tom, Dick, Harry, Jane and Lord Bumberchute has come here, muddying the waters, and generally adding noise to the signal.</p>

I think back to how the country reacted to ObL&#39;s death and look at what has happened since we killed the mastermind who essentially put us on lockdown.
These small victories are used to further the &#39;agenda&#39; some groups want instead of settling us back.

<p>May Day is related to the Celtic festival of Beltane and the Germanic festival of Walpurgis Night. May Day falls exactly half a year from November 1, another cross-quarter day which is also associated with various northern European pagan and neopagan festivals such as Samhain. May Day marks the end of the unfarmable winter half of the year in the Northern hemisphere, and it has traditionally been an occasion for popular and often raucous celebrations.</p>

<p>i try to be critical of facts and don&#39;t set out to attack people personally, but sometimes i get excited .. or drunk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the of the guilty ones here.  I have been deeply critical of threads I read here about faking the Moon landing (all of them?) and commercial airliners spraying chemicals from 30,000 feet to control us and/or give us diseases.</p>

<p>You see, I believe that the whole issue of conspiracy investigation is clouded by deliberate disinformation and giving time to ridiculous theories makes it that much easier to dismiss ALL theories by association. </p>

<p>Do you remember the scene in Close Encounters where there is a town meeting being held.  The Richard Dreyfuss character is pressing the government for real information about what he really saw and experienced.  He almost seems to be winning the argument, almost gets some real answers, and then this jackass stands up and starts talking about how he saw the alien ships and he also saw BIGFOOT, too.  And the whole meeting dissolves and the truth remains hidden.</p>

<p>There are a lot of real legitimate questions to ask about climate change, the food supply, false flag actions that lead us into war, increased government surveillance in the wake of 9-11 and much more.  But then there&#39;s this other shit:  the fake Moon landing and how Kubrick actually shot the footage (I guess Spielberg faked the pictures from the Mars rover too).  And chem trails from commercial airliners.  So fucking ridiculous to me - it&#39;s like Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster and the Face on Mars.  It makes us all look like tinfoil hat loonies.</p>

<p>I know this disinformation and the putting forward of outlandish, ridiculous theories is done very deliberately and with very clear intent by those in power who wish to continue to hide the truth.  So use your mind, people, use your head.  EVERYTHING is not a conspiracy but some things ARE and they deserve full attention and focus.  Be sensible.  Use your head.  Don&#39;t be a loony.</p>

Why make a 20&#39;-diameter plaster of paris model of the moon and build a track around it for the camera to ride on?  What about the football-field sized crane apparatus complete with fake craters?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be a loon&quot; is good advice, to be sure. But the nature of the conspiracy theory is that nothing comes from official channels. This is a very wide road.</p>

<p>Add to that that what <em>does</em> come from official channels is censored and now you&#39;ve got the added restriction that you can&#39;t say that any conspiracy theory is an outright falsehood, because then you&#39;re simply part of some disinformation campaign.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the time I did my community service for a DUI at an alcoholics-anonymous place. You can say you&#39;re not an alcoholic, but then you&#39;re simply in denial, that&#39;s all.</p>

<p>I myself prefer people to sound like loons than miss an idea or a concept, and I get MANY of them from r/conspiracy. For which I am grateful.</p>

<p>For example, the idea that some but not all of the moon landings were faked, because the aliens that run the secret base on the far side made it clear that we are not welcome there.</p>

<p>Is it true? It would explain a lot of things! But can it never be said to be &quot;loony&quot;? No, and I&#39;m comfortable with that.</p>

<p>The chemtrails, in my opinion, is a bit &quot;loony&quot; as you say, because there are much easier ways to poison us. Easier in the sense of energy efficiency and in avoiding detection. </p>

<p>Plus, if we&#39;re embracing the other conspiracies, there&#39;s a lot more air travel. So we have mutual inclusions and exclusions of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Big foot is one that I used to believe was possible, but it&#39;s been debunked too many times to remain credible. It now seems to have been a Jungian concept the whole time. A Jungian archetype.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t mind hearing and reading about them. I think the Universe is a lot more interesting.</p>

<p>Did you know that there&#39;s a theory that the Loch Ness monster is the ghost of a Stegosaur? It was the first time it had ever crossed my mind that non-humans could leave ghost-like energies. I like that idea. The truth of it is not exactly relevant, even though Truth is what I&#39;m after, I know from experience that Truth is much stranger than fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you come across something that has been posted prior or is older new, do something positive such as adding additional thoughts or information.</p>

<p>Also, considering this is the conspiracy section... most things cannot be proven nor debunked... so if someone posts something that is popularly known as a hoax or debunked, that&#39;s just popular opinion and perhaps that opinion is wrong. Encourage skepticism in both directions and focus on sharing knowledge rather than assuming something is hoax or truth. Logic and rationality tend to encourage critical thinking.</p>

<p>But as OP states, being malicious (whether intentional or not) helps no one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s naive to consider this or any other subreddit a community. Anyone with an account can upvote and downvote in any subreddit. They can submit and comment too, and if their account is banned they can just create another one.

It would not be too difficult for a group to organize less obvious ways to attack a subreddit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a hopeless cause to implore people to behave better in this or any other subreddit. It would be a better use of your effort to encourage people not to see reddit as a community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem IMO, as with everything is PROFIT, like all aspects of our lives some suits on a computer somewhere punched in some numbers &amp; realised there is a &quot;niche market&quot; to be had, so &quot;conspriacy theorists&quot; become a little slice  of the MSM pie (Exhibit A: Glenn Beck, for the crazier &quot;conspiracists&quot;, he got ratings, that was his purpose!)</p>

<p>They create shows for the &quot;history channel&quot; and what ever other channels about UFO&#39;s, secret bases, etc, etc, etc, all the while making money &amp; making most conspiracy theories, even the most blatant conspracies look ridiculous &amp; laughable in the process.</p>

<p>What this in turn creates is an almost hipster-esq conspiracy movement, the guys do it because &quot;its cool&quot;, or that want to be the guy that knows all the secrets, theres no desire to spread to truth or share information, they just want to &quot;collect shit&quot;, like Apple fanboys collecting every apple product they can afford, they simply try to collect stuff they can flaunt and then dismiss everything as if its old news. (also covers the fact these people rarely know anything of substance)</p>

<p>Also another part of the marketing machine creates the constant need for &quot;competition&quot;, this results in the put downs &amp; the attacks, because everybody wants to be &quot;number one&quot;, &quot;the big dog&quot; if you will. This for example in a sports setting would result is increased spending on services to get fitter or equipment to train &amp; practice &amp; the &quot;jock mentality&quot; in the conspiracy world it results in the amassing of info regardless of quality for no other reason than to &quot;put on a gun show&quot; coupled with this our media trained people skills means people attack character &amp; everything else first then look at the facts as very distant second, if they ever even gets that far. </p>

<p>Its genius really, because most people buy into it, the system pretty much protects itself, they just have to sit back &amp; count the dollars.</p>

<p>Anyway I could be wrrong, what do I know, thats just my buck 05. </p>

<p>And as far organized religion, you have a choice,you don&#39;t have to subscribe to any religion, your faith could be a personal thing, and I don&#39;t buy that line that primitive people came up with religion because their language and understanding couldn&#39;t make sense of the world around them, just look at the Ancient Egyptians, they had knowledge of math,architecture,masonry,carpentry,harmonics,alchemy,astrology,astronomy and pharmakia, I often think some of them were smarter than the average teenager or College student today! and let me ask you a question: how would you describe the religion of the Ancient Egyptians? we know it was Polytheistic, but how would you describe it in a few words?</p>
