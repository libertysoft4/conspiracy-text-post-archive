<p>MOST----</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People go to work/school, eat, watch tv or go on Facebook, and go to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>People don&#39;t watch or read the news, and most that do only abide by MSM</p></li>
<li><p>People think everything we talk about is a conspiracy <em>theory</em> when it is a factual conspiracy.  </p></li>
<li><p>Do not want to learn about the world, history, politics, and corruption</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, let&#39;s say for a moment that the founding fathers actually created something good 300 years ago.  It was only a small fraction of them that gave a shit and an even smaller fraction that thought revolution was a good idea.  Considering the numbers are proportionally the same, are we incredibly fucked?  The forces that control us are armed with the best weapons systems in history, the best surveillance, the best organization, and the best systems of control. </p>

<p>What could we possibly do short of sit back and watch it all happen?  Say &quot;See, I told you so, you fuckers&quot;? Become freedom fighters that would inevitably be labeled terrorists and even though we would be fighting for the freedom of our countrymen they would be turned against us in their ignorance and apathy?</p>

<p>I always see people say &quot;Rawr, lets make more posts in /conspiracy and really show em we mean business!&quot;  But the reality is, short of starting an agrarian/militia training cycle with focus on recruitment and education there really is nothing else we can do.  Just sit back and talk about it until they take that away from us...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got it about right.</p>

<p>People just want to live. </p>

<p>So they choose to ignore the truth, or lack the inner desire for the whole truth.</p>

<p>I think many of us are just truth seekers. Probably most of us were thinkers at a young age, and realized that the world operated shady, or we did not agree with a widely accepted way of life.</p>

<p>For me personally, I never accepted the,</p>

<p>Go to school, graduate at 18, university till 24-26, career, wife, kids, retire, wait to die. </p>

<p>I always thought, &quot;Well I don&#39;t wanna do that that&#39;s lame!&quot;</p>

<p>Also 9/11 was a massive flag for me when Bush said mission accomplished on that cruiser but they didn&#39;t accomplish what they said they were there to do in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He essentially means the higher you go up this &quot;Power Hierarchy&quot; Passed who prints money, passed to who owns the organizations who print money, passed that, higher and higher.... eventually you get to a shadowy area were predominantly it&#39;s based on occultism... a certain information or power passed down through societies and bloodlines. This area is the area that controls everything else secretly. Look at modern society and count how many eyes of Horus you see... It also get&#39;s more satanic, low emotions, dense viewpoints, narrow minds, lack of love. It&#39;s good and evil and evil has had control on this &quot;planet&quot; for a long time :D it&#39;s been changing for the better for at least a couple thousand years and is progressing more rapidly now, with the internet and reddit&#39;s like this.... information is spreading like wildfire. 
People are being forced to wake up now.... </p>

<p>Caste systems b/c it&#39;s a hierarchy ruling system.... slaves are on the bottom. The people that don&#39;t know the occultism are the slaves b/c they don&#39;t understand whats going on....pretty deep subject though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black people could never have changed the country by violent revolution. It was changed by masses of people simply changing their minds. </p>

<p>We also can never win by revolution. We have to attack an incorrect idea like they did in the case of racism.</p>

<p>The idea we must change is that greed is good. </p>

<p>Greed is absolutely not good as any r/conspiracy reader now knows. Greed has caused literally every complaint that we have here.</p>

<p>If we could possibly make greed as much a taboo as racism is now then we would change the world for the better and it cannot be done by any other means.</p>

<p>That is the only possible way to bring our nation and the world back to its senses. </p>

<p>That will take a catharsis. </p>

<p>When one comes, and it will, we must use it to change the attitude that greed is good because that attitude is at the root of our collective problem.</p>

<p>edit,</p>

<p>The catharsis that triggered the U.S. change from a racist country to a country where racism is not tolerated, in my opinion, was the sight on national television of black protesters being attacked by police dogs and fire hoses. The catharsis of that moment brought the change that was needed at the time. We just changed our minds.</p>

<p>When next we see such a sight, and we probably will by summer,  I hope there is a concerted effort to bring this necessary change.  </p>

<p>An overtly  greedy nation is one that won&#39;t survive into the future whereas a less greedy nation is perpetually sustainable. </p>

<p>Think of what a reduced level of national greed might mean to you personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that we need a catalyst to start really changing things, but there-in lies the problem. MSM has made average joe (and to an alarming extent, even people like us who would be considered &#39;awake&#39;) extremely desensitized to virtually <em>everything</em> - we have already seen protesters in the mideast being shot in the streets and beaten to death by police, we&#39;ve seen peaceful american college kids being pepper sprayed by cops, we&#39;ve seen OWS evicted from public spaces in pretty much every city, all in the span of just a few months. There is so much bullshit to wade through, and then so much information in general it is just easier to turn away and be blissfully ignorant.</p>

<p>The next catalyst will have to be something so ethically horrifying, so unavoidably wrong, that I am not sure I want to see such a thing; AND, it will be controlled as much as possible by TPTB. Even if they are not initially responsible for it, you better believe they&#39;ll exploit a &#39;good story&#39; to further their goals, or just plain sabotage/ruin it like what happened with OWS infiltrators. </p>

<p>The problem I see is that we may never again see such a sight.  Sure, such things might happen, but they won&#39;t be broadcasted on the news.  How much of the OWS police brutality was even talked about on the news, much less video broadcasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your error here is that you assume revolutions can still be fought in the way they used to be.  This will not be about the guns and the bombs.  This will not even be about public opinion.  <em>Fuck the public.</em>  They don&#39;t matter.  Let them update their facebooks while stuffing their faces with organic nachos... over here, we will be evolving, quietly and peacefully in our dark corner.</p>

<p>It is important to be aware of the way things are, of the things that are going on around you, and the sort of things people think about.  Don&#39;t let it get you down.  Don&#39;t let the state of things drive you to do something stupid.  You can fight for the freedom of your own mind by educating yourself and acting in such a way as to preserve the best and brightest parts of yourself for when they are needed, rather than squandering all of your intelligence on the same sort of things most people waste their lives with.</p>

<p>This will be a revolution of the mind, and this time it will not stop.  It will not be taken over by outside forces and it will not be deflected from its true goals.  At the end of it, those of us who choose to take part will simply be better because we chose to be, and it will seem like things just open up but in reality... <em>we planned the way things were to be</em>, just without letting ourselves know about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OKAY FIRST OFF, HELLO EVERYONE I&#39;M NEW. I JUST FOUND REDDIT/CONSPIRACY. Hello! I think I am going to like my stay.... and so will you guys.  </p>

<p>TL:DR - If you consider yourself &quot;awake&quot; ..I would read...you&#39;re not alone.  If you don&#39;t even know what I mean by &quot;awake&quot;...I would still read but you might not get it. Or most might not make sense....but everything I say is based on fact.....from real life experience as well.</p>

<p>This is my first post here so I hope people read it... but w/e if you were meant to read this, you will.... (Universal law of attraction) I&#39;m 24...I&#39;m awake... I woke up 3 years ago...stopped watching TV around 5ish years ago...my dad always questioned 911 and slammed bush..so I heard a little bit but not much. I was completely in the Illusion. I played football in college, I eventually tried to go to Air Traffic Control school and ended up getting 2 DUI&#39;S from Partying to much b/c that&#39;s all this society is anymore at my age. That or studying like a slave in college amounting massive debt. Or a complete slave working at 2 minimum wage jobs. </p>

<p>I WOKE UP. I STARTED SMOKING CANNABIS. I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA.
I left everyone and most of everything behind. Packed my eclipse and moved from Nebraska to Cali with a new girlfriend yaaaa SON. I started reading everyday for 8 to 16 hours on topics such as : Spirituality, Quantum Physics, Physics, Reality, Truth, Conspiracy, Law, True History, Flow of Money, What is money, What is a fiat currency, How the hell is &quot;society&quot; so backwards. ....I read on a ton of SHIT! I crammed so much information in my head in the last 3ish Years that now I am a walking Terminator to the current system.</p>

<p>I fully and completely understand &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; we are slaves. </p>

<p>I understand how the &quot;COURTS&quot; are operating and why we are considered &quot;PERSONS,CITIZENS,CORPORATIONS,FICTIONS,DEAD&quot; all of those are essentially the same. You and I both grew up in the same Educational system that is funded by these fuckers. They don&#39;t teach us how TRUST LAW/CONTRACT LAW/ROMAN LEGAL LAW works.....</p>

<p>They never told you that when you were born you&#39;re parents signed into contract with them by signing you&#39;re BIRTH CERTIFICATE. A bond/trust was then created on you&#39;re behalf...instead of for you&#39;re benefit.. the government...well just name it that for now....listed them as the beneficiary not you. They have been claiming our &quot;divine inherent rights&quot; then they created a &quot;FICTION&quot; in you&#39;re place... i.e. In our current law system you are being recognized in the court&#39;s and by judges as &quot;dead&quot;... if you&#39;re name is John Doe. In court and everything else...you are referenced as JOHN DOE. ...of course you think these are the same...but John Doe...is you the living man/woman and JOHN DOE is their creation....their FICTION, THEIR TRUST, THEIR PERSON....look up what PERSON means in Blackstones/Blacks. </p>

<p>In Reality and LAW, you govern over what you create... God/Source/Architect/Creator, created all... Mankind falls under that, Mankind in 1305.. &quot;Pope&quot; of ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH declared dominion over everything, and pronounced all dead and now fictions. The ramifications of this got more complicated and complex over the last centuries.... For the most part this is still not understood even in the Judicial System.... The presumption that you are a dead thing, a lifeless entity created by the POPE, and registered with the ROMAN LEGAL REGISTRAR has NEVER been rebutted. In LAW, if you lay claims and they are ignored. You&#39;re claims stand as law in a court of record. Silence is Acquiescence. </p>

<p>Guess what... I can do the same thing to them. It&#39;s what I have been doing. I drive with no license, no registration, no Cali Plates...been driving in Cali, LA area for 2ish years now...I finally got pulled over in November last year.... I sent in my paperwork, got it notarized.... I understand what&#39;s going on..this is from years of reading... I am sharing this b/c well that&#39;s my &quot;goal&quot; raise the vibration of this planet. Get us out of this mess.</p>

<p>I got my case dismissed. ...big win for me imo. In the system I am still considered &quot;dead status&quot; I am working on it...but together We will do it. :D If any of this interests you...don&#39;t be afraid to friend me, msg, ask a question, or visit my new blog that is dedicated to me Growing Cannabis, Spreading Truth, Vlogging/recording my daily experiences...they are getting interesting.....</p>

<p>I was late on rent....within 2 hours they put a 3DAY NOTICE TO PAY RENT OR BREAK CONTRACT. Well this is my window to rebut their claims.... if I ignore it...they can use it against me... So I wrote a letter that I am sure my apartment complex has never and completely does not understand... I haven&#39;t heard from them since.... I don&#39;t plan on it... b/c they can&#39;t. :D</p>

<p>If you read all this pat yourself on the back b/c it&#39;s some new shit. This is the revolution. The more that understand this stuff the faster we will rise together. :D Love and Peace . Namaste.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now based on one comment that I spent time on with nothing but positive intentions towards others.... I am now put into a &quot;box&quot; people like &quot;me&quot;... it&#39;s a narrow minded viewpoint. That&#39;s fine... I can understand why you reacted in such a negative way.... this is contradicting you&#39;re narrow minded belief system. I hope you got some of you&#39;re negative energy out and have a better day treating others more kindly. :D.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What can people do? They Feel powerless so expending the energy does nothing but cause sickness. Then you have that big brother bullshit with anyone who disagrees with the masters
. I choose to do nothing because 1. Subversion tactics. 2. Hegelian philosophy which I agree with. 3. Cant because of job sensitivities. 
All I can do is bitch and complain. Sad, I know. </p>

<p>But what are people going to do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my opinion that the reason people don&#39;t care is that information isn&#39;t as free as it should be, and when it gets on it&#39;s way, TPTB reset the information clock (burning Alexandia, Censoring the internet)
I&#39;m very confident that if we as humanity managed to share and communicate with eachother as fellow human beings, things would be very different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ask myself the same thing.  People are too busy, or enslaved, to care.  And the ones that do care the most are the ones most frowned upon.  It&#39;s a shitty, shitty thing how self-absorbed most people are and how much they care about the most petty things in life.  You look at the kids in middle/high school today, they are beyond anything I&#39;ve ever grown up with.  I don&#39;t know if this is because of where I grew up, or because the parenting is getting that much worse.  Once most people do start to really give a shit, that is when it will be too late.  There are simply too many fucking idiots in America, and that number is constantly increasing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked retail for Starbucks, Apple, and a casino. I&#39;ve seen every walk of life come through those doors. I&#39;ve met very few smart and intelligent people. Everyone else, they live in a bubble. I&#39;m looking at my Facebook feed, and people are clueless about SOPA. Theyre too busy talking about skiing, or sharing their dubstep Spotify list, or even posting pictures of some sandwich they&#39;re about to eat. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sickened of the ignorance and inability for our nation to unplug from a make believe world and tune into reality. The hippy movement in the 60s/70s had the right tone. It&#39;s a shame commercialism has rotted the brains of their children. </p>

<p>I was once like that. But when I moved out and did things on my own, I realized I was intelligent and a survivor. I don&#39;t need anything or anyone to rule my life. I rejected religion after high school. I was introduced to r/conspiracy, and it sealed the deal that this nation, this world, is controlled by a select few who want to keep it under a tight grip. </p>

<p>I will fight to my last breath to educate those that want to break free and learn more about how corrupt this world is. I&#39;m slowly doing it with friends and family. It&#39;s working. Eventually, it spreads. It may not spread like a disease, but one more person opened up to the world, is the potential to open another set of eyes, then maybe two more, then who knows. </p>

<p>With the Internet, we&#39;re seeing another awakening much like when the printing press was invented. </p>

<p>Books prior to the printing press were only owned by rich people because they were handmade. But with the invention of the printing press, everyone had access to books, which brought knowledge and literacy. With that brought revolution and enlightenment. We are seeing this with the Internet. We&#39;re learning about the mistakes our parents bought into. Slowly, the meek will inherit the Earth. SOPA/PIPA and NDAA are tools used to stop the flow of free information. Stop the flow of information, people are more likely to believe in controlled government messages. </p>

<p>I&#39;m stepping off the soapbox now. Good night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m pretty sure the issue is that people DONT care about their own little world. They go to shitty schools that they hate, put terrible food into their bodies, fill theyre brain with garbage on tv and facebook etc etc.</p>

<p>i really think that living a physically, emotionally, and spiritually whole life is far more important than knowing about any given conspiracy theory</p>
