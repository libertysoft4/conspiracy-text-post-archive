<p>Q: &quot;I see a lot of talk about Zionism here. Do you guys just hate Jews or something?&quot;</p>

<p>A: No. Being anti Zionism does not mean antisemetic. Not all Jews are zionists. Actually very few of them are. Most zionists are the Christian politicians and their political backers here in the United States. This is a complicated and sensitive subject and we realize this may be offensive to some people. I assure you, the moderators here are very concerned about about rooting out hate speech and defamation while leaving legitimate users the freedom of speech they deserve. If anyone breaks these rules, just click the report link under the post or comment and we can deal with it. For more on this subject, please check our sidebar links (coming soon.).</p>

<p>We&#39;re pretty tolerant of anything this side of outright hate speech. Since he seems to have fallen off the face of reddit, I&#39;ll throw user Johnny_Cash up as an example. It&#39;s quite obvious he isn&#39;t fond of Jews (or blacks, or... probably any non-WASP culture). But...</p>

<p><strong>Being</strong> prejudiced/ignorant isn&#39;t illegal, and it isn&#39;t against the rules here. However, posting/writing things which are threatening is a whole different ball of wax.</p>

<p>One of Johnny_Cash&#39;s favorite comments used to be &quot;A Jew from every lamppost.&quot; which pretty much inevitably got deleted. (Johnny_Cash earned a spot in EncyclopediaDramatica&#39;s entry for reddit.)</p>

<p>We get videos of Dr. David Duke (former KKK Grand Master) all the time, and they survive the tide of voting for better/worse. Dr. Duke&#39;s message is one of opposition to international Jewry, not necessarily the wholesale slaughter of anyone affiliated with Judaism.</p>

<p>Similarly, we get David Icke videos posted with some frequency, and Icke has been openly anti-Zionism for a long time. But, like Dr. Duke, he&#39;s not advocating harm to anyone... just awareness of what&#39;s going on in the world.</p>

<p>EDIT: tl;dr: We welcome discussion of issues. We frown on abusive intent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about the people you mention -- all public figures, for whom it is much more difficult to be honest about racial and religious topics -- is that they are not preaching hatred of any individual, or telling anyone to bomb a church or office ... they are merely speaking the truth as they understand it about the power Jews have amassed to themselves in America. Jews are 2% of the population, but their wealth and power is far, far, FAR above what that percentage would suggest. Jews are the elite, ruling class of the United States. They can be proud of their achievements ... but as for the rest of us, we need to look at the position of power they hold over us and ask ourselves, is this good for the people as a whole? Is this what we, the people, want?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was the one who drafted these rules and I agree with token&#39;s interpretation fully. We are very tolerant, some may say too tolerant of people discussing Zionism/the Jewish conspiracies. This isn&#39;t a problem with people hating Jews, this is discussion of real issues that are happening right now. The problem here is that a bunch of the main figures in this conspiracy just happen to be Jewish/zionists. This is where people get the impression that we are just picking on jewish people or that we think that all Jewish people are involved in this conspiracy. One example of such rubbish is the assertion that most if not all Jewish people avoided the wtc on 9/11 because of a warning sent to all Jews in the area via odigo messenger that an attack was imminent. That is totally unfounded and no one has ever produced evidence or a screenshot of this, and even then it could be faked. So it is unprovable, and the idea itself is particularly vile that they believe all Jews are &quot;in on it&quot;. </p>

<p>The reason we had to make a few rules here is because we are being flooded with subversive content and personalities. It is a constant battle to keep this sub clean and spam free. We had to clearly state what the rules are here to be able to enforce anything. If we just banned people or removed posts just because we don&#39;t like what they are saying that crosses the line. As far as the staus of the cleaning I would say its pretty much done. Most of the spammers and bots have been banned as well as our sub stalker. They keep trying to make several new accounts a day to continue posting their crap here, so we catch these guys a few times every day. Pretty soon our banned users page will grow to more than 50 names! It will reach 100 within 2 or 3 month if they keep it up. </p>

<p>Sub bans are reserved the the most extreme cases. As a matter of fact we have only banned one user for stalking and abuse. We have had to ban him 3 or 4 times already though because he keeps trying to come back. So fear not! We will not ban you unless you are a total dick all the time for no reason. There are a few people that are borderline, but I usually let those users slide out of compassion for the stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. People need to stop worring about who they might offend, and what might be done to them in retaliation for that offense. They need to just <em>tell the truth</em> and left the chips fall where they may. Why are people so <em>gutless</em> these days? We&#39;re not even under our own names here -- surely people can tell the truth when they are anonymous. Or is the conditioning so powerful, they behave as though they are on a leash, even when the leash is removed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just one point in response. I agree with you, the <em>perception</em> of truth can be subjective ... but if we are afraid to speak the truth <em>as we understand it</em> then where are we? We don&#39;t even have a true opinion of our own, only an opinion that has been packaged and vetted for us by the ruling elite. We have to speak the truth, as we know it, even if sometimes we are incorrect.</p>

<p>With respect to bumblingmumbling, I have seen some good contribution from him. He was being estalked for a while being acused of being an anti-semite, while I saw his posts as anti-zionist.</p>

<p>I dont care if he is participating in racist subs so long as he doesnt carry racism over to this sub. If the content of his contributions are interesting and provoking without being racist, hateful, attacking - then it is good for thought and discussion.</p>

<p>I think that most people who visit this sub are at least open to considering most thoughts. It is your personal responsibility to use your own judgement and discernment for what you choose to believe, read and look more deeply into.</p>

<p>It is not the job of this <a href="/r/">/r/</a> to censor information, quite the opposite. This lets crap through the door, as well as gold - but its up to you to choose which is which for your personal tastes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to point out that I did not arrive at Reddit and r/conspiracy from Stormfront. I came from the 9/11 Truth Movement. I started off looking into the truth about what happened on 9/11 the day after on 9/12/2001. I spent countless hours doing research. In early 2008 I finally came to the conclusion that 9/11 was a Zionist conspiracy. The Veterans Today article in early 2008 confirmed to me that I was not alone in thinking this. </p>

<p>Operation Cast Lead and the Mossad Assassination Team incident in Dubai finally made me connect all the dots and break through my denial and realize as Ryan Dawson so aptly put it, &quot;9/11, All Roads Lead to Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>Since that time I have completely fallen into the Rothschilds Zionist rabbit hole of conspiracy. It is a bottomless pit IMO.</p>

<p>A little over 3 years ago I was watching Jon Stewart, Keith Olbermann, listening to NPR and actually thought the Jews were the good guys in &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. </p>

<p>Now my whole world view has changed. 10 years ago I could never could have imagined this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the names in that list are banned here. Not even the infamous Johnny_Cash (notice his comment karma, which is in the thousands, has a minus sign in front of it). They post, the community votes (EDIT: and sometimes they click &#39;report&#39;). That&#39;s pretty much it. The only people in our ban list are spammers (mostly MartinTimothy clones) and one stalker/spammer (and known alts).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. People need to stop worring about who they might offend, and what might be done to them in retaliation for that offense. They need to just <em>tell the truth</em> and left the chips fall where they may. Why are people so <em>gutless</em> these days? We&#39;re not even under our own names here -- surely people can tell the truth when they are anonymous. Or is the conditioning so powerful, they behave as though they are on a leash, even when the leash is removed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just one point in response. I agree with you, the <em>perception</em> of truth can be subjective ... but if we are afraid to speak the truth <em>as we understand it</em> then where are we? We don&#39;t even have a true opinion of our own, only an opinion that has been packaged and vetted for us by the ruling elite. We have to speak the truth, as we know it, even if sometimes we are incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually has been censorship here.  Just a few months ago, I politely questioned the validity of the holocaust, and that comment was deleted.  Fortunately, that kind of stuff doesn&#39;t happen here anymore, but other more mainstream subreddits can be pretty bad when criticism of the jews is involved.</p>
