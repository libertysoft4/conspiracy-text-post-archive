    <div class="md"><p>If one has only the itchy feeling but not the visible fibers emerging, it may be an allergic reaction to something or things.  Such diverse items as cats, the Santa Ana wind (dust and ions) will trigger annoying itching in me of this form, but I don&#39;t consider it Morgellon&#39;s.</p>

<p>But if you have the canonical symptom - colored fibers appearing coming out of your skin, now that&#39;s true Morgellon&#39;s. Until more doctors get the disease themselves and begin to take it more seriously, the med establishment won&#39;t do anything. The CDC whitewashed their investigation, which to me says someone applied pressure. In the long run I won&#39;t be surprised if Monsanto or military bioweapons get connected in.</p>

<p>Added: the new CDC announcement is so bogus. 1) the study was conducted only among Kaiser patients, 2)  the study looked at 115 people. Total.  3) the study only talked to people they found by searching through patient records for similar symptoms  4) they claim &quot;&quot;We found no infectious cause&quot; which is not the same as being able to say there is no environmental cause,  5) where there were fibers, the researchers said all were common cotton or other material.</p>

<p>This was a controlled whitewash. Other researchers who carefully examined fiber samples from Morgellon&#39;s claimants have found by means of mass spectrometry peculiar abnormal elements, plastic materials unlike clothing fibers, and odd biological properties in them. How is it the CDC found nothing like that?</p>

Personally, I think a large number of the people who talk about it so vehemently are in fact bonkers. I can&#39;t dismiss them all as paranoid delusions, but I think people draw lines where there may not be any. The claims of the fibers being connected to chemtrails, for example. It&#39;s still very interesting and I try to read/watch anything that I stumble upon about it. Before you start pulling bits of your skin apart, you may want to try switching to a mild detergent and soap. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Might be due to GM foods (timing is there), and/or toxic food additives, strange chemicals merging with your tissue</p></li>
<li><p>Might be a buildup of foreign materials in the body, that get stuck near tissue somehow, such as hard plastics, and the body is expelling them as wires</p></li>
