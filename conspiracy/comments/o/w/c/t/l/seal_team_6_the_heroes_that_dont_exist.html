<p>seal team 6 was officially disbanded in 87.. and renamed to DEVGRU
which is the common name. yet the media keeps talking about &quot;seal team 6&quot;</p>

<p>the team that &quot;killed&quot; osama bin laden... then took only his body and dumped it at sea...</p>

<p>the team that magically boarded and flew on a old helicopter operated by the national guard (can anyone tell me since when do seals fly with the national guard)</p>

<p>and then that team dies in the crash.. the supposed heroes who killed osama.. die in a crash..</p>

<p>and now the same team that died in a crash, killed osama.. and was disbanded in 87 rescues 2 from pirates in somalia.. our HEROS..</p>

<p>WAG THE DOG folks... this is a script.. and people are eating it up.. </p>

<p>One of the helicopters on the raid was <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/us-helicopter-destroyed-bin-laden-raid-due-mechanical-failure_558565.html">lost</a>.</p>

<p>This is the helicopter that SEALs disembarked from to raid the compound.  It was rigged to go down so that no eye witnesses would make it out.  Necessary since Osama was never there, hence the inability to produce proof of his death.</p>

<p>That is why the surviving SEAL members that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tXWngXSRA">blew the whistle before being killed</a> couldn&#39;t say more than something wasn&#39;t right, but they weren&#39;t sure what really happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just going to throw it out there.  Prior service Navy.  I was stationed at Damneck Annex in Virginia Beach.  Yes, the Seals there are called &quot;DEVGRU&quot; but it is in fact still Seal Team 6.  As for the chopper that went down.  There were members of Team 6 on it but not the whole team.  There were Seals, Rangers, Para-Rescue on the chopper that went down.  As for the national guard being in that particular chopper,  that happens all the time.  Just like there are Marines on USN ships.  All the military branches work together.  That shouldn&#39;t be something to difficult to understand.</p>

<p>if and when special forces do hop rides with the NATIONAL GUARD.. its not for missions...</p>

<p>You know this from all the times you&#39;ve been called out on QRF while you were in a warzone? Chinooks are often choice for QRF operations because of how many people you can get on the ground in fewer aircraft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were in some marine aviation unit&#39;s AO they would fly on a marine bird. They were not. They were in an AO currently tasked out to a national guard aviation unit, so they flew on a NG bird. Thats how it works. When your unit is deployed you get a certain AO or sector of the country you are responsible for doing your particular thing in. So for units that operate all over the country like SEALS and SF and what not, they often hitch rides on the controlling aviation unit&#39;s bird. A more adequate question would be why they weren&#39;t flying with the 160th as that is the elite special ops aviation wing? The answer to that though is that the 160th hasn&#39;t been deployed in the GWOT in a few years. They&#39;ve been tasked with supporting special operations elsewhere in the globe.</p>

<p>Look at the content of the site, it is made for conspiracy theorist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ya, that would be almost as funny as someone telling people with first hand experience in the military that they are flatly wrong because of what you saw on a tinfoil coated website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my entire point of this is to say.. hey.. the media is making a big deal about this shit.. thus there is something NOT right here..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your point was to try and imply that some sinister figure loaded a bunch of DEVGRU SEALs (each representing tens if not hundreds of millions in training) into an aircraft and then intentionally brought it down.  You made this claim with circumstantial evidence and almost no understanding of the subject matter and that showed in your replies.</p>

<p>The next time Pieczenik came on Alex Jones&#39; show, Alex started the interview by saying this:</p>

<p>&quot;i&#39;ve since talked to a national media figure and then talked to the individuals they put me in contact with at very high level in the current CIA and they just said &#39;we want to tell you you&#39;re right about bin laden&#39; very bizarre uh three weeks ago to have this person reach out to me just to tell me &#39;i just want to tell you you&#39;re right about bin laden&#39; &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much is wrong with this post. Where to start...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the good guy version of al qaeda..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Al Quaeda is a large terrorist organization that is about big shock and awe operations that don&#39;t require much training. Seal Team 6(DEVGRU) is a very small, HIGHLY trained military organization that conducts a lot of clandestine operations and doesn&#39;t want/seek publicity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>seal team 6 was officially disbanded in 87.. and renamed to DEVGRU which is the common name. yet the media keeps talking about &quot;seal team 6&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t disbanded, just renamed. Like how &quot;Delta Force&quot; became CAG(Combat Applications Group). Seal Team Six is the common name, I work with two guys who were on Seal Team 6(I work for a private military contracting company) and they refer to it as Seal Team 6 mostly, not DEVGRU.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the team that &quot;killed&quot; osama bin laden... then took only his body and dumped it at sea...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I agree with you, I&#39;m not convinced it went down like the media said it went down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the team that magically boarded and flew on a old helicopter operated by the national guard (can anyone tell me since when do seals fly with the national guard)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the GWOT started, if a National Guard unit currently is tasked with providing air operations for that particular AO then thats the unit who flys you on operations in that AO</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then that team dies in the crash.. the supposed heroes who killed osama.. die in a crash..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to the Chinook crash or the Helo crash on the Osama mission? Cause the Chinook crash wasnt only SEALs and those dudes on the Osama mission didn&#39;t die</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and now the same team that died in a crash</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You couldn&#39;t fit all of Seal Team 6 on one helo. So the team its self did not die in a crash. Also, still very confused as to what crash you&#39;re talking about. The Chinook in 2005, 2011, or the Blackhawk on the Osama raid?</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking OP has zero frame of reference on how the military or Special Operations works.</p>

<p>Magical unicorns flew from Jupiter to smite OBL in 2001. See? My story has just as much evidence as the government&#39;s story.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going about this all wrong. People with a clue have known that OBL is long dead and he has no connection to 9/11. Knowing this, it is obvious that the government is simply telling us fairy tales, stringing us along with their imaginary villians and heroes, distracting us.</p>

<p>Long time ISI bureaucrat Hamid Gul is someone who has a clue. Check out what he thinks. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSLgC4cTKcs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSLgC4cTKcs</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the videos were faked, probably all of them.</p>

<p>Bin Laden denied participating in the 9/11 attacks right before his death. Forgive me to linking to Fox News, but it was a handy source.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34440,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34440,00.html</a></p>

<p>The videos released afterward were clearly fakes. None of them really look like Bin Laden. In one of the videos, &quot;OBL&quot; is seen writing with his right hand, despite the FBI saying he is left handed, and he is wearing a gold ring, forbidden by Islam. Check out these <a href="http://imgur.com/BCFl1">screen shots</a> of his face progressing, they are not the same person, and clearly not a man dying of Marfan Syndrome.</p>

<p>Where are these video coming from then? We don&#39;t know for sure. What we do know is that a Zionist named Rita Katz has a way of getting this intel a little...  early. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Katz">In October 2007, it was revealed that Katz had discovered and issued to the Bush administration a copy of an Osama bin Laden video which had yet to be released by al-Qaeda. Katz issued the video via a private link to a SITE web page to White House counsel Fred F. Fielding and Joel Bagnal, deputy assistant to the President for Homeland Security. Within 20 minutes, computers registered to various parts of the Executive Branch began downloading the video, and within hours a transcript referencing SITE had appeared on Fox News. Katz had requested that the web page remain confidential, and has reported that dissemination of this information tipped off her Al-Qaeda supporters who had since eliminated the ability of SITE to gather such information.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thanks for the thought out answer.  I&#39;d say that the novelty of conspiracy theories is that they are as believable and disprovable as the stated story.  I don&#39;t know what I believe in this instance.  I think the man in those four pictures looks like the same guy to me, but I&#39;m not an expert in body doubles.  </p>

<p>I think the strangest thing is that if this was a conspiracy, why would they make the story that they went into Pakistan? Why create an international dispute that wasn&#39;t necessary for a fake story anyways?  Also, why does Al Jazeera seem to support the US&#39; claims?  They have no reason to and seem to corroborate what the US is reporting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why would they make the story that they went into Pakistan?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ISI has been mostly complicit in U.S. activities. The &#39;invisible&#39; power structure in the U.S. thought they had the ISI under control. In this case, a rogue general who is done giving a shit is giving his honest opinion. A lot of people share these beliefs, it&#39;s just a matter of finding those who do not care about the ramifications of speaking truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why create an international dispute that wasn&#39;t necessary for a fake story anyways?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the point in time when the alleged Osama assassination took place, the powers that be decided to cut Pakistan loose. They could see that the country was slowly turning against them, and further cooperation would simply provide harmful evidence in the future. This is when they decided to &quot;kill&quot; Osama. Fuck what Pakistan has to say, no one in the controlled Western media would dare report on this story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, why does Al Jazeera seem to support the US&#39; claims? They have no reason to and seem to corroborate what the US is reporting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t give you a definite answer. As far as I know, Al Jazeera has been fully honest and unbiased in reporting Middle Eastern events. They are not bound under the same centralized control that the American media is subject to. To help you understand, I will give you <a href="http://imgur.com/UPYhm">this picture</a> that you probably have not yet seen.</p>

<p>&quot;i&#39;ve since talked to a national media figure and then talked to the individuals they put me in contact with at very high level in the current CIA and they just said &#39;we want to tell you you&#39;re right about bin laden&#39; very bizarre uh three weeks ago to have this person reach out to me just to tell me &#39;i just want to tell you you&#39;re right about bin laden&#39; &quot;</p>
