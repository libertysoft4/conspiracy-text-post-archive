<ul>
<li><p>the real events of 9/11 probably involved government/banking/military-industrial elements (e.g., possibly entities within, but not necessarily &quot;officially&quot; sponsored by, Israel, USA, Rothchilds, Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc.). The investigation was clearly white-washed.</p></li>
<li><p>JFK was clearly taken out with military precision. The investigation was clearly white-washed.</p></li>
<li><p>Vietnam was an exercise in military-industrial profitability (i.e., keeping unemployment from skyrocketing in the US), as was Iraq, as is Afghanistan, etc: if everyone who started working as a result of WW2 &amp; the military-industrial complex born thereof were to stop working, a lot of people would be out of work.</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 was an experiment (similar to JFK) partially intended to achieve some kind of result (unknown, probably involving money), and partially just to prove that whoever-is-running-things-these-days can do whatever they want and get away with it, in spite of everything (through media monopolies, cointelpro, friends in high places in government, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>the 2000 &amp; 2004 elections were both at least partially rigged (between Diebold, Jeb Bush, the Supreme Court, etc.)</p></li>

They want to understand the world but are too lazy to study history and politics so they listen to Alex Jones who tells them they can be just as &quot;smart&quot; as all those readers if they just regurgitate what he says.  This is why youtube is so popular here, no one can explain their position but they know a guy who makes videos with creepy music that really gets it spot on maaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn.</p>

<p>edit: Coalition Provisional Authority Cash Payment Scandal: On June 20, 2005, the staff of the Committee on Government Reform prepared a report for Congressman Henry Waxman.[61] It was revealed that $12 billion in cash had been delivered to Iraq by C-130 planes, on shrinkwrapped pallets of US $100 bills.[62] The United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, concluded that &quot;Many of the funds appear to have been lost to corruption and waste.... Some of the funds could have enriched both criminals and insurgents....&quot; Henry Waxman, commented, &quot;Who in their right mind would send 363 tons of cash into a war zone?&quot; A single flight to Iraq on December 12, 2003 which contained $1.5 billion in cash is said to be the largest single Federal Reserve payout in US history according to Henry Waxman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, FYI one of my browser&#39;s bookmarks is this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWl8mUSDIwU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWl8mUSDIwU</a>  It&#39;s called &quot;September Clues&quot;.  I don&#39;t claim to have definitive authoritative knowledge of 9/11/2001, but this was very interesting.  The skeptic in me wonders if it was doctored, but if it was it took a great deal of effort.  The last time I watched it, I thought it was fairly compelling.  I don&#39;t want to sound like Noam Chomsky here, but whether a plane hit the building on 9/11 or not isn&#39;t that significant in the grand scheme of things.  What is significant is that we don&#39;t fully know what happened and we keep getting into wars lately.  A court ruling recently was even against Iran (default judgement), yet most &quot;truthers&quot; and 9/11 victims who have tried to get a just hearing and investigation from the courts were kept out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m about to watch your video now, so i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s about planes hitting or not hitting. But my issue with them &quot;faking&quot; planes hitting the towers is simple. Sure, news channels could easily fake video of planes hitting, however, there were thousands of people in NY that saw planes hit, and probably hundreds of videos that all matchup by every day citizens. For me, personally, what gives 9/11 away as a conspiracy is WTC 7 and the Pentagon, not so much the actually WTC 1 and 2. (Although there is lots of evidence about 1 and 2 that is very convincing by itself) If your video has nothing to do with the planes.. sorry i wasted your time. lol. Going to watch now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll take &quot;my own medicine&quot; and rewatch at least some of the video too.  It&#39;s been a while since I saw it.

    <div class="md"><p>Or that alternative belief structures have an attractive draw to some mentally disturbed people?</p>

<p>When 9/11 first kicked off, the first conspiracy theorists I heard talking about it were of the opinion that the towers were brought down by nuclear weapons! Then they revised later to &quot;special&quot; nuclear weapons that didn&#39;t leave radioactive traces.</p>

<p>Needless to say, that has pretty much vanished as a theory now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always read the &quot;reptilian&quot; stuff as a reference to the &quot;reptile brain&quot;.  Yes, there are humans walking around that look like humans, but they are really &quot;reptilian&quot; in thought and nature.  </p>

<p>So they don&#39;t literally take of their human masks at the end of the day...but in some more metaphorical and symbolic ways, they do.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Had further thoughts on this.</p>

<p>In most stories dragons, western ones,  live in caves, or in the Earth.  They hoard treasure and gold and kill adventures who want to steal the treasure.  They demand sacrifice or appeasement from time to time as well.</p>

<p>Sound like any world leaders we might know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there certainly appears to be a small portion of the population who naturally exhibit sociopathic tendencies. Given the structure of our social hierarchy these people find it easier to rise to the top, or at least away from the lower levels, being untroubled by guilt.</p>

I would recommend you listen to Professor Tony Martin talks about the Secret History Between Blacks and Jews. <a href="http://www.blacksandjews.com/TonyMartin.html">http://www.blacksandjews.com/TonyMartin.html</a></p>

<p>Here is an interesting Malcolm X speech. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIkr-h_twwg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIkr-h_twwg</a></p>

<p>And this is a favorite Minister Farrakhan speech. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOe-sRUnO7Y">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOe-sRUnO7Y</a></p>

<p>Yes, I am very proud of European heritage/ancestry. I recently decided to become part of the growing White European Advocacy Movement. </p>

<p>You appear to have a very stereotypical Jewish indoctrination of the subject. Have you been listening to those <a href="http://thejewishtribe.blogspot.com/2011/12/jew-hate-rally-against-blacks-caught-on.html">subversive White AshkeNazis</a> telling you how RACIST gentile white folk are? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an exercise for you: look up the Wikipedia entries for the Iran-Iraq war and the contra wars in Nicaragua. Read them carefully, and assume that everything on these pages are proven facts.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself why the masses are not outraged at any of what happened, and if they are, how nothing happened and nothing changed (or has gotten worse).</p>

<p>Try to define &#39;sanity&#39;. There is no real definition, but in the end you will come up with something equivalent to &#39;sanity = normal&#39;. But &#39;normal&#39; is definitely crazy, because it doesn&#39;t realize or care about the stuff in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>So, being normal is being insane, but that doesn&#39;t mean that not being normal is being sane. For example, you can believe in lots of things that aren&#39;t true. Just because they&#39;re fringe and unpopular doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re sane.</p>

<p>Sanity is relative. It makes no sense to ask if you&#39;re crazy on your own. Are you crazy relative to someone &#39;normal&#39;? That person might think so, but you also believe that that person is crazy, because it disregards the truth.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re like me, you want the truth, no matter how ugly or uncomfortable. And you are ready to risk your reputation and your sanity to get to the truth. You don&#39;t even know if the truth actually exists, but you&#39;re after it anyway because you can&#39;t bring yourself to stop seeking the truth. In that process you will have to investigate topics and consider theories that may or may not be true. The mere fact that you&#39;re considering them at all may be labeled as insane by some, but it isn&#39;t, not until you believe these things without proof, or without admitting to yourself that you may be wrong.</p>

<p>Does CNN cut Ron Paul interviews as censorship, or is it just a technical malfunction? Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way to know for sure. Maybe CNN is playing dumb, and is actually supporting Ron Paul for super secret evil reasons, and it&#39;s censoring him on purpose to gather public support. Maybe CNN and everything else is all a dream.</p>

<p>We have to live with these uncertainties. Questioning your own sanity is a sign that you&#39;re not insane. Only the most insane people are convinced they are sane, and never questioning their own sanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt there has been a massive cover-up around 9/11.  What all is being covered up I&#39;m not sure, but I don&#39;t think you can believe the official story once you&#39;ve heard the evidence against it.   </p>

<p>The investigation into John Kennedy&#39;s assassination was definitely a joke, no denying that.  I believe there is obviously a cover up.  I&#39;m not sure exactly what is being covered up (I have my theories) but it&#39;s obvious when you walk through the evidence that something is amiss. </p>

<p>Vietnam, Iraq, you name the war and we probably got into it for financial reasons at least partially.  There is always a profitability factor when it comes to war.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they were experiments or not.  I have no real opinion on this yet, but that could change tomorrow.</p>

<p>Yes.  Both elections were a joke.  But keep in mind it&#39;s a lot harder to cheat if everyone shows up, they can get away with it when only a minority vote. </p>

<p>In closing I think we all feel nuts sometimes and some of us probably are a little bit at least.  But if you are cognizant enough to ask if you&#39;re crazy then you&#39;re not really.  Just make sure you&#39;re not suffering from Confirmation Bias, that&#39;s really easy to do for me and then I get sucked in further.  Sometimes you just have to step back and go, &quot;Okay what do I really believe and why?  Does that hold up?&quot; and move on from there. </p>

<p>the reality, though, is that there ARE such things as &quot;conspiratards&quot; and &quot;paranoid&quot; people. if you&#39;ve ever listend to rush limbaugh or coast 2 coast FM you would know this.</p>

<p>what we need is a more fact-based approach, and less HURRR CHECK OUT DIS YOUTUBE VIDEO YO IT PROVES 9/11 WAS DONE BY BUSH HURRRRRRRRR shit. but maybe <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is only for people who want sensationalist reptilian bullshit, not people who want intelligent discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>conspiratards and paranoia are often side effects of the abuse and eventual (although mostly incorrect) gradual deprogramming by either subversive elements such as hate groups, or the conspiracy media disinformation coupled with the extreme anxiety of an unexpected journey outside of the matrix (aka: hivemind, or consensus)of society. this is not their fault. people of a certain age probably never will wake up fully, and my heart weeps for them. these people latch onto the information that is fed to them, but through years of simply accepting claims from the media while in an alpha state, they bring this same process to their online information gathering, often getting most of their info from youtube, which is worse in some ways than the msm. they watch the videos, but fail to back up a lot of what they see with a paper trail and when these people are challenged on these false beliefs they either become indignant or they crumble like ashes in the wind. this also serves a purpose in the NWO, to frame all truth seekers as paranoid, racist, ignorant or just plain stupid and the audience just eats it up. yum yum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up with TV.  I&#39;ve for the most part cut it out of my life as an adult.  But there are plenty of Internet clips of what TV is showing.  I am sometimes around other people who have a TV on at the time.  I can see subliminal messages in TV, magazines, etc.  When TV was in it&#39;s infancy, older people supposedly would be against it and say &quot;it rots your brain&quot;.  The Internet is better in many ways, but is prone to rigging like how TV was.  Is it a mind control brainwashing box that emits flashes and neurolinguistic programming anchors and colors in a way to shape the viewer?  Every time I find myself around somebody else when a sitcom is playing (this is rare but...), I feel a little angry at even little things like the laugh track telling you that what you are watching is funny and that you should laugh.  Or other techniques like the lighted &quot;Applause&quot; sign that TV audiences have.  Even the constant bombardment of &quot;sex&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;sex&quot; written all over the photos and videos we watch (in a subliminal fashion where it is almost like invisible ink but there).</p>

<p>Brother, if you know half of what some of us did you wouldn&#39;t be here arguing with yourself over the most obvious of &quot;conspiracies&quot; and likewise trolling this community in such a way.</p>

<p>Where we have ventured to pick apart the inconsistencies and discover the pictures behind the scenes people like you draw lines and refuse to go any further. Whether you are doing this for your own gain, or for someone else... it&#39;s just sad, either way.</p>

<p>Now, I haven&#39;t read this whole thread, there&#39;s no reason to, but what I have seen written from you, aside from your initial post, is trite drivel. Even the attempt to stroke <em>one</em> of the keys and send such bullshit text is a kick in the teeth to what is eventually going to save not only your life.</p>

<p><em>&quot;put out a feeler to see if people think so too&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Lewlz j/k you guys are fucking crazy tinfoil hat reptilian fuckerz bahaha&quot;</em></p>

<p>The justification one requires to confirm a lie is truly amazing. Nothing but &quot;Oh it&#39;s just...&quot;. Cognitive dissonance. Heard of it?</p>

<p>If you are truly serious in your &quot;beliefs&quot;, I would suggest either a good hallucinogen, for a quick realization of just how insignificant your ego is, or do some <strong>real</strong>, hard work on yourself and come to realize the truth. </p>

<p><em>(I didn&#39;t see anywhere that he was being called a shill. Still the same, to try to lash back at someone in legitimate query says just that, if not what I am telling him to do in these posts: get rid of the ego.)</em></p>

<p>What does this say to you in their attempt to come to an understanding about this persons beliefs about certain events? To call a spade a spade and then lean to his ego and say these blokes are blind it&#39;s clearly a clover when it&#39;s painfully obvious his ego is still getting in the way and this guy is a joker.</p>

<p><em>&quot;One does not simply walk into Mordor.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And one does not simply see, or hear, the truth. If he is serious, if he is seeking, if he wants to know the truth the first thing to do will have to be a change of him; it will have to be his acceptance of denial - to everyone and everything.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t understand why it is interesting I put in a quote of him talking about &quot;tinfoil hats&quot;. Elaborate?</p>

Just as tin foil could be used to enhance a signal on old antenna, it was believed would repel the same signals and keep them out of your brain.</p>

<p>If you have ever seen the movie <em>&quot;Signs&quot;</em> by M Night Shamamsdlfkjaghylan, there is enough reference in there.</p>

<p>So, because people like us, back in the day, would talk about how these radio waves were influencing us negatively and would at the same time talk about the governments and even the global cabal, to an extent. The unfortunate thing is that people at large do not make distinctions between different subjects and it all gets jumbled up into one big cluster fuck of a nut show. *( in reality it is all essentially one big show)</p>

<p>It&#39;s a matter of seeing the trees through the forest and the forest through the trees. Being able to do both as best as possible. Many, many trees to see. Fewer and fewer distinguishable forests. (Meaning they are or have grown into each other - one big cabal.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets get out of any conspiracy theories for a second and see things in a different light...</p>

<p>The pursuit of the truth is usually an insane project itself - according to everyone around you. You are questioning the very fabric of the society you live in. You might not like the answers, you might create a more &quot;true&quot; reality by your questing for the ultimate truth... and you might really mess up your society. So yes, it is insane.</p>

<p>I rest quite assured that anyone who was thinking the Earth is not flat was considered &quot;insane&quot; at one time, same for the person who first thought that maybe Kings and Queens were not sent from heaven or the guy who first thought about radio transmissions...</p>

<p>Anyone who goes out to see if there is a deeper truth usually gets labelled that. And of course you would question yourself, but damn it your thinking on your own and maybe realizing there is a deeper truth than what you can see.</p>

<p>Also, think about this one... Somebody probably said just after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, &quot;ya, know, I think the Government set that up!&quot; and I am sure he was berated and told he was insane. But it was true, and he was not insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me see if I can set your mind at rest on some of these points you raise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There&#39;s no doubt that the investigation into 9/11 was white-washed. The question is, why? What was being covered up. My own suspicion is that it was done to protect Israeli and Saudi interests connected with the CIA and the Pentagon. We can&#39;t necessarily assume that a whitewash occurred because the highest members of the US government caused 9/11. That doesn&#39;t necessarily follow, and to me sounds a little on the nutty side. But I have no doubt at all that Israel knew about the attacks before they happened, and did not inform the proper authorities in the US, because Israel wanted a terrorist strike against the US. I doubt the Israelis ever imagined that the strike would be so massive or so successful. But much of the coverup surrounding 9/11 is covering up the role of Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>JFK assassination? It might have been the work of a single crazed gunman. It might have been two gunmen, and we don&#39;t know who the second is. It might have involved LBJ ... that wouldn&#39;t surprise me since he was a total son of a bitch. I agree, the government swept the events surrounding the assassination under the carpet much too quickly, but I doubt it was a CIA hit.</p></li>
<li><p>Vietnam was more a matter of not knowing what they were getting into at the time. They wanted to fight the war, but at the same time were told they could not finish the war because China might not like it. So the war got prolonged, and many elements discovered that there was big money to be made from prolonging a war. We suffer the consequences of this discovery today, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and  maybe soon to be Iran. But Vietnam was mostly a matter of screwing up, and then taking the illegal profits that came from the screwup.</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 was obviously planned by somebody, and whoever planned it had some skills and resources. My pick, Mossad. I doubt they ever thought the impact of the planes would actually bring down the Twin Towers. They just wanted a major terrorist attack in the US to draw the US into war in the Middle East ... and of course the neo-cons in Washington wanted it and aided them in their purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>As for the rigged 2000 and 2004 elections, there is always fraud of some sort in any major US election. Did it influence the outcome? Maybe, in the case of 2000. But maybe not.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>First 3 IMO are true.
Last 2 I&#39;m not sure.
There is plenty of proof. I think you are suffering from the need to think that everything is OK and normal. I wish it was, but we&#39;ve moved beyond all that. They call it a &quot;normalcy bias&quot;. It&#39;s scary when the nightly news never mentions any of what you think is true. It makes you question yourself. Start with what you can verify. Quit hoping your TV will help you; it never will. Don&#39;t worship that box. The truth is everything they deny. If you ever wonder why these people do this or that, the answer is ALWAYS money and power. Start from there. But there&#39;s a lot of crap and disinformation out there. Verify what you believe to be true. Some of your friends will never be aware of this stuff and perhaps be blissfully ignorant. Maybe that&#39;s good. Some of them will get seriously angry if you try to tell them they been betrayed and everything they know is crap. Go slowly. People are waking up that something is very wrong. Zbignew Brezinksi and the CFR are worried about the global awakening here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZyo9HRGeWw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZyo9HRGeWw</a>  . Funny a google search on the &quot;Council on Foreign Relations&quot; brings up 10.2 million hits but they are never mentioned on your TV news - never, even though they openly tell the government what to do. They recently announced it&#39;s time to invade Iran. Is that a conspiracy?</p>

Cee Lo Green sings a song called “Crazy” that has some poignant lyrics; “Maybe I’m crazy… but it wasn’t because I didn’t know enough, I just knew too much.”  The point here is that there is a HUGE amount of information in the world, and our minds were not designed to handle that much information.  If you think you’re overloaded, slow down, chill out, relax, and be a bit “dumber…” because, sometimes dumber is actually smarter in the eyes of others.  What matters the most?  Having fluid, positive communication with others, so protect your monolithic psychology, and keep it solid and strong in the eyes of others.  You don’t want to communicate in an unclear, scatter brained, irritated, excessively excited, or crazy way, else people might look at you and think, “What in the world is wrong with that person.”  Note: unless you’re intentionally trying to be funny and those listening are enjoying it (but don’t do it too much).</p>

<p>So their coordination / sympathetic actions can be seen as merely a stunning and constant series of coincidences amongst the same group(s) of people.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you just mean there is probably no global cabal of people trying to push a single platform (i.e., no one &quot;NWO&quot;). I&#39;d say that the fact that we have a world currency and a capitalist-modeled economic system makes everyone part of the same conspiracy. The rich want more money, and they communicate, at the very least, through trade, etc.</p>

<p>What do you mean by this? A <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conspiracy">conspiracy</a> is malice planned in secret by two or more people. You don&#39;t really believe there are no conspiracies, do you? </p>

They want to understand the world but are too lazy to study history and politics so they listen to Alex Jones who tells them they can be just as &quot;smart&quot; as all those readers if they just regurgitate what he says.  This is why youtube is so popular here, no one can explain their position but they know a guy who makes videos with creepy music that really gets it spot on maaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up with TV.  I&#39;ve for the most part cut it out of my life as an adult.  But there are plenty of Internet clips of what TV is showing.  I am sometimes around other people who have a TV on at the time.  I can see subliminal messages in TV, magazines, etc.  When TV was in it&#39;s infancy, older people supposedly would be against it and say &quot;it rots your brain&quot;.  The Internet is better in many ways, but is prone to rigging like how TV was.  Is it a mind control brainwashing box that emits flashes and neurolinguistic programming anchors and colors in a way to shape the viewer?  Every time I find myself around somebody else when a sitcom is playing (this is rare but...), I feel a little angry at even little things like the laugh track telling you that what you are watching is funny and that you should laugh.  Or other techniques like the lighted &quot;Applause&quot; sign that TV audiences have.  Even the constant bombardment of &quot;sex&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;sex&quot; written all over the photos and videos we watch (in a subliminal fashion where it is almost like invisible ink but there).</p>
