    <div class="md"><p>Television, the mind bending power of Television is working. Look at it, see it for what it is. A hate machine full of hate.   </p>

<p>The so called current affairs and news shows push hate to the max. Making you hate fat people, drug takers, Christians, Atheists, Chinese, Australians, the other political party, petrol prices, food costs, Turbans, milk,  etc etc. There is very little good news displayed. People don&#39;t want that... we the people, are told.  If it&#39;s not making you hate something, it&#39;s trying to make you buy something and all the while laying it thick with lies and deceit. Monkey see, monkey do. TV makes it happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>program (n.)</strong> 
1630s, &quot;public notice,&quot; from L.L. programma &quot;proclamation, edict,&quot; from Gk. programma (gen. programmatos) &quot;a written public notice,&quot; from stem of prographein &quot;to write publicly,&quot; from pro- &quot;forth&quot; (see pro-) + graphein &quot;to write&quot; (see -graphy). General sense of &quot;a definite plan or scheme&quot; is recorded from 1837. Meaning &quot;list of pieces at a concert, playbill&quot; first recorded 1805 and retains the original sense. That of &quot;objects or events suggested by music&quot; is from 1854. <strong>Sense of &quot;broadcasting presentation&quot; is from 1923.</strong> Computer sense (n.,v.) is from 1945. Spelling programme, sometimes preferred in Britain, is from French and began to be used early 19c. <strong>The verb in the figurative sense of &quot;to train to behave in a predetermined way&quot; is from 1963.</strong> Related: Programmed; programming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agreed.  you are born, and you die, and in between it&#39;s television programming.  people cannot even begin to comprehend the power of the corporate media brainwashing they experience on a DAILY BASIS when they have experienced it their whole life.  kind of like how an abused child rationalizes his/her situation and often goes on to repeat it.</p>

<p>they key to tackling the problem, much like alcoholism, begins with recognition of the problem. in the case of the American, it is that the enemy is in charge of the distribution of information through corporate media networks and they do not play fair.  so we recognize the problem?  okay, now how do we proceed in combating it?  proper awareness will never be promoted in the public school.  and promotion of these &quot;unorthodox ideas&quot;, unfortunately, is not tolerated by the &quot;good parents&quot;/customers of the private educational institutions who only want their children to grow up into successful slaves of the machine.  </p>

<p>so what, may i ask, is the most effective method by which the children can glean the necessary information to actually fight the monsters that force us into funding their evil endeavors across the globe?  family.  nothing else is as naturally effective.  not enough people possess the requisite level of curiosity that many of the internet readers of &quot;conspiracy&quot; websites such as this exist to effectuate change... and internet freedom is on its way out.  family.  don&#39;t forget it.  never let the information be forgotten by the children.</p>

<p>Only makes sense really. </p>

<p>So when the TV and media puts forth an unrealistic picture of perfection, and you want to be what you see on TV, you will never reach that perfection, creating a deep void in yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are too stupid to see that, they will divide themselves from others based on lines which when tallied up only make us different by a tiny fraction, lines of ethnicity, geography, financial status, etc.  People fail to realize that we are all made of the same stuff, are part of the same family.  Somehow our species finds its more reasonable to say we are different based on something that makes up less than 1% of who we are than to say we are the same based on the 99% of things that make us alike.</p>

<p>Edit: Unintentionally used the 99% and 1% monikers from OWS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be the change you want to see.  People aren&#39;t too stupid, they are ignorant, as in uneducated, to why we should love each other.  Think of how much people are told to hate one another, and how much of &quot;the other guy&quot; is always the problem.  </p>

<p>So lighten up, spread the message with love, rather than berating people.  It&#39;s so easy to become jaded, we must work hard against that.</p>

Sure, folks do fucking retarded shit- to themselves and to others.

<p>In this sense I think that the people who use this symbolism seem to believe in the symbols they&#39;re using. And since those symbols [light / fire / mind] are what we would call &#39;Illuminati&#39; symbolism I&#39;m willing to accept that the users of such symbolism believe in light [illumination] as a symbol. Does that mean there is such a thing as The Illuminati? Well, they seem to think so. So, maybe there is. </p>

<p>In either case I&#39;m going to operate as though the symbolism they use is real to them.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>&quot;onemis&quot; &gt; nonsense. It literally doesn&#39;t mean anything at all. It&#39;s not taken from any language that I know of so if it happens to mean something I&#39;m not aware of it. It was a series of syllables that, when put together with &#39;arc&#39;, sounded like the kind of name one would give a transformer.</p>

<p>The meaning of my name: I used to type in &#39;MASTER&#39; when I&#39;d get high score in Tetris when I was a little kid. &#39;Archonemis&#39; is a sort of tip-of-the-hat to nostalgia. Hurrah.</p>

For some reason they do not push the ‘scientist’ or ‘mathematician’ button(s) in my head. 2.) No subliminal messages? You clearly haven’t spent much time on symbolism / semiotics. 3.) Popular concepts. In strictly academic terms, popularity in thought is meaningless. 4.) Newton was not an originator of these concepts. He was reading source material. 5.)

    <div class="md"><p>enough research. No amount of research can make the dumbshit myth of the Illuminati to be real. You really need to do the right homework to understand world corruption. It&#39;s really as bad as people think it may be under a whatever Illuminati syndicate, but it&#39;s nothing like that, just that organized crime is all over the world, whether it&#39;s gov&#39;t colluding with outside groups or whatever. Think about the legalized structure of corruption that runs through the revolving doors of Washington. If the US has this type indirect corruption and an unimaginable scale, think think about the other nations (also developing ones, which are the worst).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I been studying the CIA old boy network and big banks.  Sure, Illuminati myth correlates with the Big Banks, but that&#39;s a system legality that is one of the most widely hit by corruption (central banks).

<p>the less developed countries are a whole lot more corrupt than our country. </p>

<p>If you ever decide to read something that relates to this actual corruption I suggest you pick up a book about &quot;Inslaw Octopus: the findings of Danny Casolaro&quot; and &quot;the Creature from Jekkyl Island&quot; to explain to you the evils of central banks.

Yes, the systems described are corrupt to the core, or rather, corrupt <em>as</em> the core - that is how they function. I have only read one history of the J.P. Morgan line and banking system and the Jekkyl Island stuff doesn&#39;t mean anything to me - if you are going to borrow, [<em>if</em> you are going to borrow] as a state or semi-state like company, you will borrow from A or B or... the Fed ... or X or Y or Z and they will all have their own special ideas about fucking you up the arse in their own special way:  The Fed or Mr Z, screwed either way, they thought the Fed was a better idea, and went about making it happen as they are wont to do.</p>

<p>Love is definitely the answer to singular, individual spiritual growth and ultimate emancipation - where borders and cultural irrelevancies are of no importance.  </p>

<p>Systems of control will always manifest themselves in the physical realm, but if one is able to maintain a sound appreciation of life through love, all corporeal borders are of no relevance.</p>

<p>Although it is tempting to thirst for a progressive, utopian society, I am beginning to realize that it is from within where I will witness the greatest revolution.  </p>

<p>I have no religious beliefs, save my strong appreciation for myth, the art of story-telling and metaphor - all three expressed in the physical form, but also become something built by us from within.  </p>

<p>Indigenous people across the world have still got it right philosophically - despite their systematic brutalization and ethnic cleansing by war and now policy - that we are of the earth and therefore responsible for maintaining a mutual balance of reverence and respect with this planet.  </p>

<p>I strongly agree, with all the hoky bullshit aside, that since there is no way of representing &quot;love&quot; in a monetary system, there is no room for love through direct democratic representation under our current social organization.  I am of the opinion, however, that under the present-day neoliberal global financial system we can best represent ourselves through the dollar bill by directing our movements with our spending.  Peoples&#39; movements have proven increasingly easy to form and gain momentum via the internet, and instead of protesting on the streets with picket signs, we should organize huge amounts of people to redirect their spending and even make runs on major banks that engage in fraudulent behavior.</p>

<p>If our representatives will not REPRESENT us, then we must represent ourselves in the most effective fashion under the present circumstances - REDIRECT OUR HARD-EARNED $$.</p>

<p>You have a well-written and well-intentioned post.</p>

<p>Not to rain on your parade, but even if we all stopped buying from &quot;evil megacorporations&quot; and doing business with culprit banks, the Fed will simply create+transfer money to keep them afloat.</p>

<p>I strongly encourage you to do business with moral companies, as it helps them.  But that will not stop the well-connected immoral companies.  This is a much deeper problem than simple consumer choice.</p>

<p>The Fed has the power to make money FROM NOTHING.  And give it to whoever they want.  They literally type in 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s into a machine and can make their pals trillionaires.  Until this is stopped, your HARD EARNED $$ are a joke to them.  &quot;That guy actually had to EARN his paltry allowance! haha! sucker!&quot;</p>

<p>The problem with your solution is that even with a huge majority of people voting correctly with their wallets, we are still being vastly overruled by a small minority of people who print the money.  They too are voting with gigantic endless wallets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying give up and don&#39;t try.  You <em>should</em> spend wisely.  Just don&#39;t get sucked so deep into their game.  Valuing THEIR money as if it were super-important is what props up the class system and keeps them on top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Runs on banks have been proven very effective actually, and with the advent of the internet it is more within reach than ever.</p>

<p>You see, we (and businesses) have the most control over the small amount of hard capital that is deposited and represents the &quot;fraction&quot; of fractional reserve banking.  Banks engage in investment risks that far exceed their fractional reserve amounts, but this risk they engage in is possible only if they follow regulations closely, which specifies across the board that some &quot;hard&quot; currency and collateral must be kept in banks&#39; control.  The truth is, mathematically, banks are on the precipice of bankruptcy during every single minute of their operation.  It is only because this type of banking is accepted worldwide that they can hold on to the banking collective, and save themselves from falling down this precipice.</p>

<p>The key to what you are missing, and maybe I was not clear about, is that we hold the spending power, which plays out an important relationship with GDP, and in turn the ability of banks to lend out money, and essentially make money out of thin air.  If we were to take one out of the mix, lets say consumer spending, and America is the engine that runs it all, then you take a guess at the outcome if we were to discontinue purchasing products that outsource jobs, or build military hardware.  You see, the banks are so intertwined by owning debt, or loaning money, to corporations and people that if consumer spending were directed in the right way, a major bank could be targeted by the industries it invests in.  It is a complex solution, but a HELL of a lot less bloody than an all-out revolution and dark ages!</p>

<p>Its like someone approached a web designer and said, &quot;Alright look man, I want a website that is vaguely reminiscent of a late-90&#39;s geocities site.  Now, the key here is to make it as convoluted and difficult to read as possible; this will make sure only the truly dedicated will read the whole thing. I&#39;m thinking a single massive wall of text, interrupted with some videos.  Also, do you accept bits of string as payment?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... say you&#39;re wrong, or even deceiving us, but we take your advice anyway?</p>

<p>We&#39;d live happier lives for it.</p>

<p>Besides, with what gets into the actual news, it&#39;s easy to feel like you&#39;re always under attack. Fear is excellent for manipulating public sentiment and making people ask what they should do next too. Take a break from it, love someone, and you see that even if the news is true, life isn&#39;t like TV. That&#39;s the world&#39;s despair, distilled into a block of information. It&#39;s far thinner in almost anyone&#39;s life, and mixed in with plenty of good things as well.</p>
