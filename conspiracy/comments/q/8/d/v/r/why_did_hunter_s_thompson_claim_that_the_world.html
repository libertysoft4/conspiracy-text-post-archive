        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In his last book - <em>Kingdom of Fear,</em> Hunter S. Thompson stated:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Didn&#39;t i tell you that the end of the world (as we know it) will happen in the summer of 2012. This it what my people tell me to believe, and i have no reason to doubt it.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Was Hunter privy to insider knowledge of some kind? He was a little crazy at the best of times but also highly intelligent with many good journalistic sources. When i first read this in his last book, several years ago it knocked me off my (imaginary) stool.</p>

<p>Can anyone shed light into why he made this statement?</p>

<p>With all that being said, he was on a lot of drugs throughout his life. Long term hallucinogenic use can cause permanent instability in your brain, especially as much as he did.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this got downvoted which is fine. I just wanted to clarify that I am not saying he is nuts, or having encounters, it&#39;s just an interesting coincidence and another angle to look at when wondering. Hell, his enjoyment of such things may even just give him a better ability to look and interpret the big picture and make fairly accurate or interesting predictions. I am also aware that he in fact did have some pretty interesting contacts and could be in the know on something from a more mundane but no less interesting and/or scary standpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read all that stuff and it just seems so far fetched yet the Bohemian grove is sketchy as fuck. Bob Weir from the grateful dead is also a member there. I wouldn&#39;t doubt Hunter S Thompson to get caught up in some sketchy shit just out of curiosity and his never ending search for weirdness. It seems to me that it could be true, but you have to consider the source of the information. I don&#39;t know, for me it doesn&#39;t change the fact that he was an amazing literary figure and will be a permanent one. His work is unparalleled and though often imitated, never duplicated. I loved his thirst for life and experiences and sometimes, as I know, that can take you into situations you don&#39;t want any part of but have no choice so you buckle up and white knuckle through it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hunter S ran with a certain crowd. He didn&#39;t suffer fools easily or take convention seriously. Which is also a working definition of elite types. Put two and two together and you have to understand that while you can&#39;t easily picture him mingling with suit-and-tie types from the TV he was probably a very attractive asset to the real elite of the world for his attitude to life and his raw perception. <strong>He also said they were going to make it look like a suicide</strong> over the phone, the night before he died.
I ain&#39;t trying to sell you a definite narrative, but this site has some dope brainfood on the matter:

    <div class="md"><p>Im reading this book again right now. Hunter was a goddamn maverick and had wisdom on par with other great people of history. His writting style and use of language always blows me away. </p>

<p>As for the reference to the end of the world, i think he was just pointing to the fact that the world is getting more and more fucked up in various ways and people want to believe in the end of the world. He saw the madness around him and just admitted that it seems more amd more likely these days. I&#39;ve never been one for &#39;prophecies&#39; or &#39;predictions&#39; cause i subscribe to the philosophy that life and reality isnt written until you&#39;ve lived it. But i do know that the fragile and finite world we live on is very very susceptible to an unimaginable amount of world destroying dilemmas and scenarios. Thats my rant, im done.</p>

This question is based on one small excerpt from the book, he states it towards the end of the writing (page 328). it  struck me because when i read it, i was already familiar with the long count calendar end date and the works of Terence Mckenna and timewave.

Very much worth checking out. Just hit up youtube.
