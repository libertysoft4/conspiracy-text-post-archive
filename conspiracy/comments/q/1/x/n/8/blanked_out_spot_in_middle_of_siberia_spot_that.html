    <div class="md"><p>ATS had a p good thread on this. Someone who spoke Russian asked around on the web forum of a nearby town and posted this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve made a small exploration at the forum of this small city Egvekinot(my native language is russian) so there is a resume of all posts from that forum (<a href="http://forum.egvekinot.ru/viewtopic.php?t=1334">forum.egvekinot.ru...</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People who live there tells that it&#39;s far away from the town (it is 70 km away stright line only). To get this place takes about 200km. There are real TAIGA (huge and solid forest area), lots of predator animals (bears, etc.) citizens of Egvekinot won&#39;t goes such far for hunting or fishing. It is no reason to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some people called FORESTMAN(don&#39;t know the right analog in english, but those people are forest watchers/keepers/holders/observers) - it is a name of profession. So one of those forestmans of Taimir reservation told about to facts. First, - ZFI (don&#39;t know what its about, but it&#39;s about Taimir military base or something). Secong, - about this Egvkinot case. Close translation quote: This place has earth opened wounds of gold right to the pitch. No development or research is there due to affraid or scare to ruin the world economy. Place is classified as topsecret.</p></li>
<li><p>Some rednecks there planned to visit this area, last post from them was in june 10, 2009.</p></li>
<li><p>Helicopter(civilian or military, - don&#39;t know) pilots won&#39;t share their airmaps while request. Just denied with no comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Some hunters been there, nothing strange were found, - not confirmed.</p></li>
<li><p>No roads are there. Something that is not obviously a road even for outrunner vehicles only. Could be reached by helicopters only.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s highly-speculative what he&#39;s saying (at best) ... however, if there was too much gold just laying around to physically remove, the people who currently have gold would become broke. This wouldn&#39;t be an economic collapse in lay terms (you and me would see it as an economic boom, since the fatcats would lose their grip on world political power) ... but in rich people terms, yes it would destroy their wealth instantly.</p>

<p>Supply and demand. If gold were as common as say, salt water, it would be worth about as much .. as salt water.</p>

<p>But to allege that this is a fact would be irresponsible at this point. It&#39;s just a theory, and not a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a lot of places in Sibera are reachable by helicopter only.  That&#39;s one reason the Russians have such huge helicopters (the politburo didn&#39;t see the need for attack-only helicopters so they all had to be dual-use).</p>

<p>The &quot;gold story&quot; is insane...that&#39;s just the first place people&#39;s minds go.
I&#39;d say it&#39;s more likely a military base.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a LOT of time in Russia and let me tell you this-- there is no chance that there is gold out there.  There are simply too many people in charge (a remnant of the old soviet system) and too little regulations or ethical boundaries--</p>

<p>For example they took the tanks and helicopters that were irradiated from nuclear tests and buried them in a hundred different spots around the empire--- now people are dying from eating food planted on top of these pieces of earth.</p>

<p>Sometimes having a single strong executive is a good thing.  Decisions get made and orders get followed...the Russians are all about passing the buck to the next 100 people in charge.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that you can&#39;t &quot;make a deal&quot; with the russian &quot;government&quot; because nobody is really in charge.</p>

<p>We see Putin as a hardass when really it&#39;s all bluster and posturing-- not because he wants to but because <em>he has to,</em> it&#39;s all he&#39;s got.</p>

<p>Of course any real adversary like the US won&#39;t be affected, but maybe they are more concerned about terrorists/extremists/guerrillas.</p>

Siberia is a great place to put something that you want forgotten but it seems like a lot of effort to take someone all the way out there just to let them rot. Not to mention resources needed to sustain the administration of the facility. Just seems to me that Russia would be more economical with it&#39;s political prisoners in the 21st century.

    <div class="md"><p>Come on - gold!? For shit&#39;s sake, someone from the outside would have spilled the beans by now. Plus governments would be fighting over it or disputing in some fashion. Plus Russia would be <strong>rich</strong> bitch!</p>

<p>Whatever it is, it&#39;s way more serious than just possibly impacting the world economy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s serious enough that NO ONE has been able to get close and report back, ALL governments collude to hide it and it is located in one of the most remote parts of the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rendalsham forest UFO incident. Probably the most credible UFO account of modern times. Well documented, military witnesses, filed and investigated by the MOD... Never debunked or denied. Jim Penniston was an RAF officer who actually placed his hand on a landed saucer type craft. At the time he didn&#39;t tell the whole story out of fear for his career, but he later revealed that upon touching the hull, a flood of 1s and 0s overtook his brain. He tried to repress these numbers for decades until recently, when he finally wrote them down. That made the numbers in his head stop, but he still kept it secret. A journalist convinced him to hand his six pages of hand written binary over to a programmer, and that statement is what emerged after machine translation. </p>
