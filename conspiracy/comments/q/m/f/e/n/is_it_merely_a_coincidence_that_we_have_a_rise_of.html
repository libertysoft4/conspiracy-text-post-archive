<p>Update in January 2012: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,808793,00.html">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,808793,00.html</a></p>

<p>Is this an attempt to draw more troop support?</p>

<p>Someone as tuned into this effort as the director of this viral video would have KNOWN that Obama&#39;s administration had supported the effort to find Kony nearly 5 months ago. </p>

<p><strong>Why release this video now?</strong></p>

<p>Are they trying to subversively rile up popular opinion for the effort or is this just a massive attempt to justify a larger intervention?</p>

<p>I think Kony is a bad guy...but the timing of this just seems really off...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering about the timing, as well. Granted, my major in college was international studies with an emphasis on African politics, so I&#39;ve been familiar with the issue for quite a while, whereas a lot of my friends weren&#39;t even aware that child soldiering existed until yesterday.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I definitely feel that there is something off about the video. You&#39;re not alone, not at all. Perhaps what concerns me the most is the marketing campaign for <a href="http://invisiblechildrenstore.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/kony-kit">Kony Kits</a> and bracelets, obviously marketed towards youth... &quot;People will think you’re an advocate of awesome&quot;.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d agree that they are definitely trying to rile up popular opinion, particularly in the youth. My generation has a tendency to jump on the bandwagon for &quot;good causes&quot; without further researching the situation or looking at the repercussions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess i was being inaccurate. I will admit that yes, they did include the fact that the government was trying to help...</p>

<p>It just seems like this is a plan being used to support the mission by drumming up popular support...not by just investing enough effort to go ahead and do this thing on a full scale.</p>

<p>The US never needs a lot of reasons to get involved in things...it seems we&#39;re on edge about Iran...but finding a murderous thug who employs child soldiers? We need the public to get angry...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came to say this.   Why did Obama send troops before it even went viral.  Looks like he opened a can of worms and wants to get the american emotion machine running before hes seen as a war monger.
If you look at his financial statements hes been working with 6million dollars. 6MILLION DOLLARS with an organization thats named Invisible Children.  If it was the Stop Kony Express it would be directed.<br/>
This will be a war against all of africa.<br/>
China has invested hundreds of millions of dollars peacefully into Africa just recently.  Everyone wants to see Africa civilized, peaceful and pumping those rare earth materials out to us. 
America is choosing War
China is choosing peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>China has been incredibly sly and exploitive on their part as well, perhaps on par with our wonderful multinational corporations (Walmart, ect.) China has huge investments in oil and mineral resources in Latin America, and reports are now coming about documenting incredibly shady work practices and worker abuses. Before we put China on a pedestal we  need to look deeper into their economic practices. Their policies are Monsanto on steroids. </p>

<p>Tamoil won the contract to extend the 350-kilometer pipeline from Eldoret to Kampala in 2009 but the project&#39;s start-up has been delayed mainly due to conflicts over land as well as increased costs due to a change in the original design of the pipeline.</p>

<p>The discovery of oil in Uganda has necessitated the changing of the pipeline design to allow reverse flow enabling the transport of refined oil products from Uganda to Kenya for an export project.</p>
