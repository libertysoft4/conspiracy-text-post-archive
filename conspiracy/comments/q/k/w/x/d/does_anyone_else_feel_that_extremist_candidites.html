        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems that just after Bachman and Palinn were out of the running, heat started to accumulate around Romney, but then Santorum comes into the picture. With everything about him and his policies being laughable, he makes any other republican candidate look moderate in comparison. Where as, if Santorum had never gained popularity, people would be focusing on crazy quotes from other candidates.</p>

<p>Was just wondering if anyone else had been thinking this.</p>

<p>I think Rick Santorum is great, I think all of the candidates are great! every election in the last 12 years has been great! I think these politicians are a great reflection of America, what  it means to be an American!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made this exact argument with McCain/Palin where they were extremist/crazy to make us FUCKING RUN into the hopey changey arms of Obama, who used emotional rhetoric to make us believe that we were indeed changing this nations direction.</p>

<p>Clearly, we were all EXPERTLY manipulated. EVERYONE should study that period in very close detail.</p>

<p>The fact is that Bush and <del>Emperor Palpatine</del> Cheney were overt and blatant warmonger murderers. They knew that the nation could only take so much of that style of tyranny, so they used Obama to appear as the antithesis of them (he&#39;s even fucking BLACK for fucks sake! How could A BLACK MAN be anything like these evils pieces of shit!!??) -- but the truth was, while Temporary represented death and war, Obama represents greed and exploitation and financial slavery.</p>

<p>They crashed the markets in 08 to make sure that EVERYONE was focused on &quot;oh fuck! how am I going to survive without a job/money&quot; rather than have any time to reflect on the outright devastation that had occured over the last 8 years.</p>

<p>Then, in Obama&#39;s first term they, as quietly as possible, put into effect the most egregious laws to make sure that any awakening masses could be quickly named illegals to quash any attempt to fight the tyranny.</p>

<p>Amazingly, though, movements like OWS STILL happened. But it doesnt matter. </p>

<p>Protests will change nothing.</p>

<p>They know this - everyone knows this.</p>

<p>NOT A SINGLE PERSON went to prison for either 911 or the financial ruin wrought by the banksters!</p>

<p>So, the best you all can do - is lay low. Stay under the radar. Stock what you can. Love your families and eschew dependence on the fiat system as much as possible.</p>

<p>Who knows what is in store in the near term, but as much as possible, stay alert and don&#39;t believe a single thing you see via &quot;programming&quot; channels.</p>

<p>There has been a significant shift in conscious in the last year. Power will use force to maintain its position. Know that war with Iran is a direct threat on you. Not from Iran - but from the USISRAELI cabal. They are threatening to CREATE a war to keep their power over others in place. They seek to send many millions to their death to keep their strangle hold on the US &quot;sheeple&quot; who they can simply use guilt to exploit trillions from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s amazing how the only awake people/discussions are here on r/conspiracy. Look elsewhere on this website and redditors will argue in favor for a particular candidate or policy or how they predict such candidate will &quot;change&quot; the course of our country. Such Sheeple. If everyone thought in the same frequency as us here we might actually see some real change! I must say tho r/libertarian tries too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>their end goal is to get either Romney or Obama into office - maxes out to &quot;optimum&quot; corruptibility and public appeal (&quot;optimum&quot; for them).</p>

<p>Santorum is there, as far as i can tell, as nothing more than a sick insult to the public.  they are moving to make it appear as though the public has rejected Ron Paul and libertarianism, for  some strange reason.</p>

<p>all that should pretty much go without saying at this point.</p>
