        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me preface all of this by saying, I&#39;ve never given much stock to conspiracy theories as a whole. Many of them require such intricate machinations that I don&#39;t think they could be covered up for so long, or would require more competence from more people than I&#39;m willing to credit the human race with.</p>

<p>That said, the past day or so, it&#39;s like I&#39;ve been pulled into a rabbit hole, and little bits and pieces of things I&#39;ve seen lately are starting to create an ominous picture. And the scariest part (to me) is that it doesn&#39;t require that complex of a scheme... at all...</p>

<p>Alright, I really have a strong intuition that this Kony 2012 thing is a distraction for some bigger story. We all know that there have been some very suspicious <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXi-oDoMQhc">FBI actions</a> and <a href="http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/breaking-tsa-threatens-mainstream-media-not-to-cover-story/">TSA actions</a> in the past few days. But I really feel like there&#39;s a major cover-up going on with this &quot;campaign.&quot; At first, I felt like it might be a political candidate trying to draw attention away from Super-Tuesday or something moderately tame like that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m starting to feel like that would be... er... simpler than the real story. Although the political aspect of calling it &quot;Kony 2012&quot; and releasing it on Super-Tuesday (technically it was released Monday) have a strong psychological effect (it&#39;s essentially using very basic priming to get it stuck in their heads), I now truly think that that timing is ONLY to use that priming.</p>

<p>Without going into all of the criticism of Invisible Children (which are numerous and mostly valid... though I will maintain that there&#39;s at least an argument that the &quot;filmmaking budget,&quot; while separate from the program budgets, could be considered a &quot;program&quot; because it&#39;s raising awareness... I&#39;m not sure that that argument is strictly ethically <em>correct</em>, but nonetheless...), I&#39;m very interested in one person in particular.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Keesey</strong></p>

<p>Keesey is the Executive Director and CEO of IC. What first drew me to start looking into him was that he IS the top of the company, yet I haven&#39;t seen his name in ANY of the media rebuttals. So, I started poking around publicly available records on the internet.</p>

<p>At first, I had no idea what I was looking for. I tried to find any tie between the FBI and Keesey or IC. I couldn&#39;t turn up a direct connection, but then I found something rather startling on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-keesey/4/b19/24a">Keesey&#39;s Link&#39;dIn page</a>. He leap frogs from an investment banking company, to a management consultant firm, straight to IC. It&#39;s not an entirely unexpected career path, but it&#39;s a bit unusual to move into a high-capital non-profit after a couple internships and to build it up in less than five years.</p>

<p>My working theory is that Keesey made some connection at <a href="http://www.brentwood.com/">Brentwood</a> that took him to <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/">Deloitte</a> (which does some high up business in Africa... a brief search turned up <a href="http://www.techzim.co.zw/tag/deloitte/">this</a>... granted it&#39;s Zimbabwe and not Uganda, and that they&#39;re not really even that close... but I don&#39;t remember if I heard that the LRA had been in Zimbabwe or something...) which set up IC as a media front for some of their less scrupulous actions. Granted, it&#39;s only intuition and a working theory.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where I need <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>. I need help to sort out all this information, to follow the thread and see if it leads somewhere. I keep coming back to the word &quot;Evangelical&quot; too... If Keesey has a connection, I strongly feel it will be church/evangelical related. I&#39;m not so good at all this, but it&#39;s your bread and butter. Maybe I&#39;m completely wrong, but better to be proven wrong than to have never said anything at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that he was at JP Morgan is a red flag.  It&#39;s obviously not any kind of incriminating evidence, because I&#39;m sure there are some good people that work there too, but I agree it is fishy.  Great find, I hope someone can dig something up on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely that we need to stop these people before causing real harm, and I&#39;m glad to see this propaganda campaign is turning people towards us wacky conspiracy theorists that might be the only people that can work objectively on this. </p>

<p>We need to find out first who these people are getting grants from. We need an entire financial history, and I think the best course of action might be through anonymous or sympathetic hackers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks?INTCMP=SRCH">This article might show us the tactics they would use to send this viral.</a></p>

<p>On reddit, social networks, and blog comments &quot;sock puppets&quot; may be in use to steer the conversation, but these may also just be misguided people because the best propaganda gets people to make arguments for you.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of anything else that might be particularly damning evidence but this is absolutely the place to suggest leads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think it&#39;s more likely that IC is/was a legit organization, but somewhere along the line, outside interests became involved either financially or with assistance in developing their &#39;programs.&#39;  Maybe the CEO is part of that, maybe not.</p>

<p>One idea might be to sift through IC&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/invisiblechildreninc/videos">278 YouTube videos</a> and media history to determine whether they have always been in favor of US military intervention, or whether the emphasis on hunting Kony (rather than building schools and the like) suddenly developed out of the blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really good line of thought as well. I still can&#39;t shake the USC connection the filmmaker, Jason Russel, has (i.e. USC to Hollywood to detaining foreign nationals on foreign soil for &quot;pirating&quot; to calling Hacktvists terrorists to OWS). I wish it weren&#39;t so late, or I would do some more digging.</p>
