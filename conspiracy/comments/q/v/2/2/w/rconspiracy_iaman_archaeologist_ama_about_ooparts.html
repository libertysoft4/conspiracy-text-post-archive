    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say &quot;human sacrifice altars&quot;.  There is evidence of human sacrifice in various cultures, but by no means is this universal (nor exclusive) to pyramid cultures.  Also, the pyramids were not necessarily the site of sacrifice.  For instance, the cenotes are much more associated with sacrifice for the Maya than are their (many) pyramids (with that said, there are some sacrifices associated with the pyramids).</p>

<p>Mesoamerican pyramids were structures with temples on top.  We know this because of the artifacts we find at the top of them.  Incidentally, there <em>are</em> some Mayan pyramids that were used as tombs.  For instance, the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan had a burial chamber.</p>

<p>In short, differences between structures are determined by the details of construction and the artifacts found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piri&#39;s map is not a map drawn from direct exploration, but rather as a combination of extant maps known to him.  And parts of it are extremely accurate! </p>

<p>As for explanation, I assume you&#39;re asking about the claim that it shows Antarctica.  It doesn&#39;t.  The Hapgood &quot;correspondence&quot; is full of distortions of Piri&#39;s map.  Why is there land shown there in the first place?  As I said, it&#39;s a combination of many maps, as Piri himself said.  Many of those are products of a theory that northern land mass needed southern land to balance it and keep the world from tipping over.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Piri&#39;s map is accurate for part of the world.  Doesn&#39;t show Antarctica.  Hapgood was a shoddy geographer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, I think the peopling of the Americas by a series of maritime &quot;hops&quot; down the west coast is entirely possible.  That&#39;s not a particularly sensational view, by the way.  Many anthropologists are pretty excited about new evidence indicating early mariners.  The peopling of the Americas is not settled science by any means, and very very few anthropologists claim it to be!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Respect. What are your &#39;personal&#39; thoughts on the idea of a deluge, or a cataclysm in antiquity that possibly was acknowledged in ancient monuments like the Giza complex? Do you think whoever built these structures were trying to relay a message for future generation? In short, do you think that the worldwide pyramid phenomena of antiquity is trying to reveal a bigger concept than simply the burial of dead kings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there may well have been local deluges and flood catastrophes.  I haven&#39;t seen evidence (nor have my geoarchaeological colleagues) that there was a massive global or super-regional deluge.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen, the people who build the Egyptian pyramids <em>were</em> trying to relay a message to posterity - but it was about the pharaohs.  We should be careful not to conflate all the ancient monuments into one phenomenon.  For instance (as discussed above), the different pyramids around the world had different aims and different cultural significance to the people who built them.  When we build <em>anything</em> that&#39;s meant to last a long time, we&#39;re trying to say something to future generations, I think.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think it was bigger than their cultural and religious beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh.</p>

<p>Follow up question(s)....</p>

<p>According to Egyptology, the Great Pyramid at Giza (now proven to have 8 sides, not 4) was built in 20 years using <strong>only</strong> human labor, stone hammers, copper chisels (none of which have been found, btw), logs (imported from Europe, really?), vine ropes, and animal fat. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried the math on this, and it isn&#39;t adding up. There are over 2 million stone blocks in the Great Pyramid (aka Khufu&#39;s Tomb), each of which weighs 2+ <strong>tons</strong>. </p>

<p>In order for them to have completed this phenomenal task, the mathematics says that they would have had to place one block (weigh 2+ tons) every five minutes, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for the entirety of that 20 year period. </p>

<p>2,000,000 / 20 = 100,000 (blocks per year)</p>

<p>100,000 / 365 = 274 (blocks per day)</p>

<p>274 / 24 = 11 (blocks per hour)</p>

<p>That&#39;s about one 2+ ton block every five minutes, so perfectly positioned that you can&#39;t fit a razor blade between them. </p>

<p>And, supposedly, this culture was only a couple thousand years out of the stone age?</p>

<p>If you extend this mathematics to include all of the logistics for the manpower (horsepower/physics for moving the blocks converted to human power only, the food to feed them all, etc) to accomplish this, well... I may be exaggerating a <em>little</em> but... it seems it would take the entire current population of the earth to accomplish that.</p>

<p>Other related questions...</p>

<p>If this was Khufu&#39;s tomb, why are there no hieroglyphs <em>inside</em> the pyramid (other than a tiny piece of graffiti in the upper chamber with all the other graffiti)? And, why is the only other relic referencing Khufu a 6 inch figurine, when other pharoahs have (in addition to &quot;pyramid tombs&quot;) enormous statues and such?</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a part of this story which says that &quot;grave robbers&quot; raided this pyramid (they entered, went up to the &quot;burial chamber&quot;, stole the mummy and the booty, put the 2 ton lid back on the casket <strong>and resealed it</strong>, and left without leaving any trace of having been there). But... modern explorations of this pyramid had to blast a hole in the side of the pyramid to gain access.</p>

<p>This whole narrative sounds like someone made it up to impress a small child, to me.</p>

<p>What is your take on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, let me say I&#39;m not an Egyptologist.  My professional expertise lies elsewhere, and it&#39;s not possible to be an expert in everything.  That said, I&#39;m familiar with some of the pyramid archaeology.</p>

<p>We know there were many many people involved in the construction of the Great Pyramid - we have their cemetery, which is a massive site <a href="http://www.drhawass.com/events/cemetery-pyramid-builders">link</a>.</p>

<p>And we know the Egyptians had wooden sledges - we have one from Dashur.</p>

<p>As for the precision, you should remember that they did use mortar in the construction of pyramids.  That has a way of filling in a lot of gaps.  The remnants of the ramp used has also been found off to one corner of the pyramid.</p>

<p>The argument from incredulity doesn&#39;t really work, especially when you say they&#39;re only a couple thousand years out of the stone age.  If you look at the state of technology two thousand years ago, our current technology looks pretty farfetched too.</p>

<p>As far as the interior artifacts go, I don&#39;t have enough knowledge to talk about that with any authority.  Sorry I can&#39;t give you a good answer, but I&#39;d rather do this than talk out my ass!  Hope you understand.  It&#39;s worth pointing out, though, that pyramid construction techniques look like they change significantly over time.</p>

<p>But we don&#39;t currently have the technology to do this same task. Not even with modern powered equipment. At best, we could make it out of concrete (like the Hoover Dam), but not out of hand-chiseled 2+ ton stone blocks. And 20 years would still be a stretch.</p>

<p>Allow me to point to the OP&#39;s previous response where he acknowledged not being qualified to answer the question. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s hogwash. Your &quot;conspiracy video&quot; pot-shot is the most commonly &quot;regurgitated&quot; ad hominem attack in this subreddit. Specifically, because it categorizes documentaries which don&#39;t comply with institutionally approved dogma as &quot;crazy&quot;, simply for addressing the questions that academia has left unanswered (or which has answered in a profoundly ridiculous manner).</p>

<p>So, I can just as easily point this whole argument back at you... and ask: Why do you keep believing what you&#39;re told to believe? It&#39;s all argument from authority, in the first place.</p>

<p>While, the OP has already dismissed argument from incredulity, I&#39;ll entertain your implied derision for one moment, but only one...</p>

<p>This may have changed in the last 5-10 years due to advances in military helicopter transport (and that&#39;s a big maybe), but last I&#39;d heard we didn&#39;t have cranes that could place the top few layers of 2+ ton stone blocks (which, by the way, the &quot;sledges&quot; story doesn&#39;t account for, either -- it works okay for the bottom 1/4 or so [although not at the rate they claim for the Great Pyramid], but after that... the &quot;ramp&quot; would begin to rapidly become <strong>miles</strong> long... and there&#39;s no evidence of <strong>that</strong> ramp anywhere to be found). Please don&#39;t focus on proving the individual pieces. Anyone can do that. I&#39;m talking about one 2+ ton hand chiseled stone block being placed with perfect precision every five minutes, night and day, for twenty years straight. The institutionally approved fairy tale for that is complete garbage.</p>

<p>What about the elongated skulls that have been found? I think Nefertiti was one? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few things are going on here.</p>

<p>First, be careful not to conflate the various types of elongated skulls.  Some are indeed deliberate deformation, a practice documented on every continent save Antarctica.  This is done a couple different ways, depending on the culture.  Some used boards, some used bandages.  This process can produce different bone structures as the bones knit and develop in different ways (it&#39;s only possible to deform the skull on infants, as their skulls have not fully developed yet.  You&#39;re correct that deliberate deformation doesn&#39;t appear to be able to change the cranial volume.  Which brings me to...</p>

<p>Another type of deformed skull are those unfortunate individuals suffering from some kind of congenital defect, like hydrocephaly.  This sort of disorder <em>does</em> dramatically alter the cranial volume, and accounts for many of the &quot;alien&quot; skulls.</p>

<p>Last, a few are hoaxes, but not many.  Except for the crystal skulls.  Those are definitely hoaxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The antikythera mechanism is pretty cool.  There have been some really well-done papers in <em>Nature</em> about it.  You can read the summaries here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism#Nature_papers_2006_and_2008">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism#Nature_papers_2006_and_2008</a></p>

<p>Basically, it looks to be an astronomical computer.  The Greeks and Babylonians had a pretty cool understanding of how the stars moved around (though obviously they were still wrong about quite a bit!)</p>

<p>Göbekli Tepe is really exciting!  It could really change how we think about the past, but we need to do a lot more work before making bold assertions about it.</p>

<p>At Baalbek/Heliopolis, the very largest stones are still in the quarry.  I believe the engineers moving them simply reached their limit.  The slightly smaller (but movable) stones frequently have their weight exaggerated.</p>

<p>At Nan Madol, there are a line of dropped stones in the water between a quarry and the site, suggesting (but not proving) that the stones were transported by watercraft.</p>

<p>Without knowing which Central American spheres or tool marks you find questionable, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t say anything about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, those stone spheres.  I&#39;d forgotten about them.  As I recall (and I can look into this more if you&#39;d like), they&#39;re not nearly as spherical as they were originally reported.  I&#39;m pretty sure these are the ones where the guy who first measured them ignored any concept of significant figures, averaged his tape measure numbers, and claimed some absurd precision.  Dishonest!</p>

<p>The antikythera device is nothing but a well-put-together orrery.  The gearing is good, but the Greeks understood circular math very well indeed.  There are surviving Greek treatises describing the math you&#39;d need to figure something like that out.  People in the past certainly weren&#39;t stupid!</p>

<p>Baalbek and &quot;why&quot;: They were building fuck-off big temples there.  The portions remaining are <em>enormous</em>.  Religion drives people to make gigantic structures.</p>

<p>Baalbek and &quot;how&quot;: Ramps, and lots of mechanical advantage combined with lots of people.  People can move <em>tons</em> of weight with those two things.  Surprisingly so, actually.  I&#39;m not familiar enough with that site to be able to draw you a picture of how the stones were moved on that particular site.</p>

<p>that can lift 1200 t at an 8ft radius which is almost 90 deg straight up, it can&#39;t boom out at that kind of weight, the huge stones were moved just over 1km to the construction site, i would have to disagree with you on which portion of the venture was easier, i think it was more difficult to move these stones horizontally than vertically</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Sometimes people accuse academics of not being willing to engage people who have questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I do appreciate the fact that you acknowledge at least this much, but there&#39;s a larger criticism I think you&#39;re ignoring; and, that is...</p>

<p>Academics are unwilling to consider explanations which don&#39;t fit the institutionally approved narrative. The explanation always given is something like: I&#39;ve seen very little evidence to support this explanation  (or similar) when, simultaneously, there&#39;s very little evidence to support the current explanations - they&#39;re all &quot;educated guesses&quot; (on <strong>both</strong> sides). Academia simply discounts, mocks, and ridicules those &quot;educated guesses&quot; which refuse to comply with the authoritarian approved narrative. And, when confronted with difficult questions, they dodge, shuck and jive like pro basketball players.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I appreciate your willingness to discuss things here. On the other hand, you exhibited all of these avoidance traits in many of your answers. When you say &quot;I have seen no evidence&quot; or &quot;Science has no proof of&quot; or any of those equivalents, what you&#39;re really saying is &quot;That doesn&#39;t fit with my story&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very tolerant of every branch of conspiracy theory research that gets presented in this subreddit. Even those things that I think are completely and utterly ridiculous (I won&#39;t mention which ones). I discuss them enthuseastically and show respectful interest in the alternative perspectives. I encourage people to pursue their interests. And, I rarely, if ever, discount anyone&#39;s ideas as crazy drivel.... unlike Academia, which does this on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for taking the time to do this Q/A. I respect you for that, at least. However, you didn&#39;t really make any progress toward proving that Institutionalized Academia is open to considering anything other than what&#39;s already been given official stamps of approval. That is, I&#39;ve not changed my mind about you folks... not one iota.</p>

<p>Peace</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to imply that it was intentional (including the &quot;duplicity&quot; that you resent). My assertion is that you are conditioned to behave this way. </p>

<p>And while you did disclaim knowledge in some instances, you still chose to comment about the (implied) intelligence of considering alternative explanations, which is, itself, a form of derision.

<p>Only once, in this entire Q/A, did I see you open to alternative explanations and that was the case where Institutional Academia had already said that it is safe to do so. </p>

<p>Resent all you want. I really don&#39;t care. I thanked you for taking the time to do this Q/A, and my thanks for that was sincere.

<p>I was being honest in my previous comment, and am being equally honest in this one (sue me).</p>

<p>Not true. I base my opinion only on how open they are to considering any explanation that isn&#39;t institutionally approved (I&#39;ve read/heard these already, bro. And they aren&#39;t adding up for me. Thus why I&#39;m willing to consider alternative explanations -- keyword: consider, not &quot;believe&quot; -- unlike Institutional Academia).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not &quot;every single academic&quot; only those ones who steadfastly defend the institutional dogma, and dismiss (often with ridicule) any other explanation. In my view, this is falls squarely within the realm of intellectual cowardice.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only mentioned this once before (under a previous username), because I believe it is irrelevant to intelligent discourse. Nonetheless, I have two college degrees (admittedly not in archeology) and an IQ of 165 (Cattel B). I&#39;m as qualified to speak my mind on a public forum as anyone, but I don&#39;t appeal to my education as making me an authority on anything.... because <strong>it doesn&#39;t</strong>. </p>

<p>The OP, for all we know, might be a college undergraduate, or he could be a PhD-ed field researcher, or anything in between (or none of the above, just an ordinary r/conspiracy troll). It doesn&#39;t change the fact that he was not open to any alternative explanations throughout this entire Q/A. He simply defended the approved narrative... which is precisely what is stifling our understanding of human history... how civilization magically appeared fully fleshed out and evolved, replete with complex religious, governmental, and judiciary systems which modern societies developed over the course of almost 10,000 years of precedent (in fact, little has changed in modern societies in this area - our current governments, religions, and judiciary are based on 2-5,000 year old precedent).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also looking like the OP has recruited (or someone has recruited on his behalf) a defense force to attack anyone who didn&#39;t immediately fall back in line to worshiping the institutional narrative. But that may just be a superficial impression (still, it&#39;s looking that way this morning).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, I don&#39;t have a defense force.  Everyone here is unknown to me.  Still, I can&#39;t prove that, so I don&#39;t expect belief.</p>

<p>Civilization definitely did <em>not</em> appear fully fleshed-out!  We do not know exactly how it developed back in the far past, but we&#39;re learning all the time.  One thing we know definitely is that complex society did not arise whole.  We can look at its development through archaeology, and I&#39;ve mentioned that in Gobleki Tepe.  That site absolutely changed the way we think of civilization&#39;s development, in one fell swoop.  We used to think that the hunter-gatherers developed agriculture, then cities, then temples.  Now it looks like the hunter-gatherers developed temples, then agriculture, then cities.  Huge change in thinking, and that&#39;s in just the past 15 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as I mentioned in a previous comment, Gobleki Tepe is the only one where you were willing to consider alternative explanations, but... only because institutional authority says it&#39;s okay for you (an academic protecting his reputation among academics) to do so. (Again, my implication is that you are conditioned to behave this way, not that you&#39;re deliberately being deceptive.)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While I, an alternative thinker, can certainly appreciate this, I find it slightly disingenuous in that it only applies where the institution says it&#39;s okay. &lt;-- I ask you. Are you really unable to see this? That you only get excited about new ideas when the institution has said it&#39;s okay to suggest new ideas in this limited area? From your comment(s), I almost get the impression that you&#39;re waiting for the institution to tell you what the new narrative is.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m extremely dumbfounded by Institutional Academia&#39;s arrogant unwillingness to accept the possibility that human society might have annihilated itself in the past and re-inhabited constructs of a previous civilization (possibly more than once). This extreme hubris is just mind-boggling to me. They simultaneously say that all these <strong>enormous</strong> structures are &quot;religious temples&quot; built by manual labor only, but that the religious historical references, themselves, are all just the ravings of drugged up priests smoking opium. That is, they reject the whole picture in favor of the little crayon drawing they&#39;re making which makes contemporary society seem like <strong>the</strong> pinnacle of human evolution, rather than <strong>an apex</strong> in a cycle of apexes. Radio-carbon-dating is dismissed if it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative. Why? Because they don&#39;t want to change the narrative.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not, in any way, attempting to defend religious dogma, either (I think institutions in general share the same sets of problematic obstacles - mostly that of stifling new ideas - for god&#39;s sake, man.. look at the dark ages and the inquisition for examples). </p>

<p>tl;dr: Institutional Academia is hypocritical in what it chooses to endorse and or dismiss, based solely on how disruptive it is to the existing dogma (Gobleki Tepe isn&#39;t an exception, it&#39;s actually an illustration of this rule - a &quot;Huge change in thinking&quot; which, coincidentally, won&#39;t contradict the sacred Darwinian texts).</p>

<p>Sure sounds like they are following the academic narrative to me! There are multiple times that they say that &#39;evidence shows&#39; or &#39; I&#39;m not sure, but this is what I think&#39;, and that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what you do as a conspiracy theorist and skeptic. You take the evidence that you have been shown, have found yourself, or find to be relevant and you make your claims based upon that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s only a different perspective based on different data sets, not a conspiracy to silence any other voices. Of course you can have your position, but if you have an extremely small dataset, or a dataset that can be logically and statistically proven to be something completely different, then you need to concede that maybe you might be wrong. </p>

<p>All of science (at least most of the time) is completely willing to look at differing evidence and contrary evidence. If they didn&#39;t then we wouldn&#39;t be where we are now with the current era of scientific discoveries and inventions, so saying that academia doesn&#39;t allow new concepts in is being disingenuous, at best. </p>

<p>But, this only applies to me (or &quot;us conspiracy theorists&quot;), right? It doesn&#39;t apply to, say... the fairy tale of building the Great Pyramid by hand in 20 years. Why?

    <div class="md"><p>First off, let me say I&#39;m not an Egyptologist.  My professional expertise lies elsewhere, and it&#39;s not possible to be an expert in everything.  That said, I&#39;m familiar with some of the pyramid archaeology.</p>

<p>We know there were many many people involved in the construction of the Great Pyramid - we have their cemetery, which is a massive site <a href="http://www.drhawass.com/events/cemetery-pyramid-builders">link</a>.</p>

<p>And we know the Egyptians had wooden sledges - we have one from Dashur.</p>

<p>As for the precision, you should remember that they did use mortar in the construction of pyramids.  That has a way of filling in a lot of gaps.  The remnants of the ramp used has also been found off to one corner of the pyramid.</p>

<p>The argument from incredulity doesn&#39;t really work, especially when you say they&#39;re only a couple thousand years out of the stone age.  If you look at the state of technology two thousand years ago, our current technology looks pretty farfetched too.</p>

<p>As far as the interior artifacts go, I don&#39;t have enough knowledge to talk about that with any authority.  Sorry I can&#39;t give you a good answer, but I&#39;d rather do this than talk out my ass!  Hope you understand.  It&#39;s worth pointing out, though, that pyramid construction techniques look like they change significantly over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, it&#39;s hard to pick one single most interesting find!  Probably any of the big Mayan sites, if we&#39;re talking about a single site.  Those are amazing.</p>

<p>L&#39;Anse aux Meadows is pretty special too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the creation of the gearing in the antikythera mechanism are what is interesting, it uses some fairly advanced concepts that don&#39;t really fit with the technology of the time,</p>

<p>for baalbek do you have any reasonable explanation of why would someone move 1000+ ton stones or how, the same for nan madol, the stone would require an extreme amount of work, using canoes or bamboo craft</p>

<p>i am looking for for a site with good pictures of the tool marks they are in my bookmarks from years ago...</p>
