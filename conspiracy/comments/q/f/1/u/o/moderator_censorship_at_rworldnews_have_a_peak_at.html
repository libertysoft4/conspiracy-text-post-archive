        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the moderators at r/worldnews is concocting seemingly arbitrary excuses to justify deliberate censorship of submissions that he doesn&#39;t want reddit&#39;s readers to see. </p>

<p>Here is my submission: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/qexg9/120_french_troops_captured_in_syria/"><strong>120 French Troops Captured in Syria</strong></a></p>

<p>And here is my correspondence with the moderators:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Me:Can you pull this submission out of your spam queue?</p>

<p>Maxion[M]: I am sorry but this submission is not appropriate for this subreddit.</p>

<p>Me: Please explain. How is this not worldnews? </p>

<p>Maxion[M]: <strong>We don&#39;t allow videos.</strong></p>

<p>Me: Would you kindly point me to the posting where it explains that you do not allow videos to be posted to r/worldnews?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>crickets</em></p>

<p>Of course, the notion that videos are not allowed in r/worldnews is bunk. Here is another video, from another state-owned news agency, discussing the fighting in Homs, Syria:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/qevn2/paul_conroy_describes_slaughterhouse_in_homs/">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/qevn2/paul_conroy_describes_slaughterhouse_in_homs/</a></p>

<p>The difference between the two submissions is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The BBC submission carries no real news other than informing  viewers that there  is fighting in Homs. The title of the submission and the narrative relayed in the video are highly emotionally charged, but otherwise this story which was approved conveys no new facts.</p></li>
<li><p>The RT video also informs viewers that there is fighting between Syrian forces and insurgents in Homs. It&#39;s tone is not emotionally charged. It also apprises viewers of three important new facts:</p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>The Syrian government reports that French soldiers were in Homs, Syria.</p></li>
<li><p>The Syrian reports the capture of 120 of these French soldiers.</p></li>
<li><p>The French ambassador has been recalled to Syria.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Which of these is legitimately more newsworthy?</p>

If it doesn&#39;t have the Maxwellhill or Solinvictus stamp of approval it won&#39;t get very much traffic.  I don&#39;t know what happened there, but that&#39;s not how reddit was a year or 2 ago.</p>

<p>A lot of the big subreddits are driven by a small group of powerusers now.  It kinda sucks.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems like it has a &quot;classic&quot; reddit feel where you get content from all sorts of different people from all corners of the internet.

Besides being obvious, this has also been pointed out to the administrators numerous times, starting even before the subreddit system was deployed.

    <div class="md"><p>It had its own given right to exist such as r/horsefuckers would of if it was created. Cp was not allowed there and the rules even talked about reporting anyone sharing such.  When it went down 20 popped up in its place. Reddit was created for absolute freedom, sadly it is being hosted in America where we dont have freedom but everyone hates us for it. Honestly, its existence was never anyones business, subreddits are there to be clicked or scrolled past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit was not created for &quot;ultimate freedom&quot;, it was created to be a link aggregator, and whatever it morphed into past that has little or nothing to do with freedom. Anything that&#39;s illegal in the US is off-limits for reddit. You don&#39;t see any subreddits for the dissemination of torrents, do you? How about a subreddit for downloading movies, music or games? What about a subreddit for planning attacks on US soil or assassinating presidents? You won&#39;t find any of these subreddits, because they&#39;re against reddit policy and US law- same with propegation of child pornography. 
It matters exactly not at all that the mods of jailbait had rules against sharing child pornography when <em>child pornography was being shared anyway</em>. 
And yeah after the removal of jailbait, 20 new subreddits popped up, but now that the reddit admins have gotten their head out of their ass, they&#39;re all gone as well.</p>

<p>TLDR; Reddit has to follow certain laws and is not for &quot;absolute freedom&quot;, and never has been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats why i said its sadly hosted in the US, i don&#39;t disagree with anything you say. Its a goddamn shame it is or it would be a utopia of free thinking and interaction, something it is not. Regardless jailbait had nothing wrong that it was doing except being in a legal grey area, and again, of there was sharing it was not endorsed, it was done privately between people, something the entire subreddit shouldn&#39;t be punished for when they were following rules. Also child pornography is still being shared, you don&#39;t think r/jcpennykids would have nothing bad going on? Or maybe r/ deadkidpics? Or r/toddletsintiaras? Fighting this on the internet is useless, there is always a way and all this does is make you feel that you can sleep well at night knowing that ALL FORMS OF SHARING HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED when that is just unrealistic. So sleep well, nothing has been done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has always been sly about how deletions and bans work to confuse spammers.  This really confuses legitimate users though when they are moderated because, well, they don&#39;t really know it.</p>

<p>Making their audit log public would be awesome, but it will probably never happen because then they would have a million people bothering them now that they realize they were moderated.  Nobody ever logs out to look and see if their submissions and comments are showing up, so you would never know that you have been moderated, so you never complain.  Imagine if you actually knew when they deleted your post.</p>

<p>Basically, they would have to face the consequences of censoring (rightfully or wrongfully).  They don&#39;t want that.  It means being held accountable for their actions.  Moderators don&#39;t moderate to be held accountable, especially those who are looking for a minor position of power they can abuse to make themselves feel superior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a shame that a site that purports to be anti-censorship (jailbait saga, black out etc) is so scared of being transparent and holding the mods accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree.  If you want to be a moderator you should be held accountable for censorship.  The way to do that is transparency.</p>

<p>If you want to hold a low-level position of power then you have to be willing to adhere to basic levels of accountability for your actions.  You don&#39;t get authority with no accountability.  That&#39;s authoritarianism.  </p>

<p>Basically, reddit mods pretend they like democratic processes while arguing for authoritarianism.  That is why asking the mods what they want is stupid.  Of course authorities are going to argue for authoritarianism, because it benefits them.  If you want to know how reddit should be moderated, ask the USERS.  </p>

<p>I have heard USERS say time and time again that they want to see the moderation log, especially for these big subreddits.  I think it should be for every subreddit.  Again, you don&#39;t get authority without being responsible for your actions, that is just absurd.  And you don&#39;t ask the authorities how much power they want to have, you ask the governed what they would consent to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a mod on r/worldnews and while I wasn&#39;t the one who removed the post I can assure you we do remove posts that are direct links to videos or image galleries.  I&#39;m not sure why we do it, it was a rule the mods enforced since long before I became a mod there.   If you&#39;d like to try finding an article that goes along with the video (like the second link) you can resubmit and it should get through fine.</p>

<p>I agree that if a rule like no direct links to videos/pictures is going to be enforced it should be listed clearly on the sidebar.  Otherwise it seems as though the mods are just pulling rules out of their ass and could lead users to believe that we&#39;re censoring posts, as has happened here.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge we don&#39;t pick and choose what is a reputable source so as long as you repost as it as I suggested with an accompanying article it should be fine.  If it doesn&#39;t appear in the queue send a modmail and I&#39;ll see what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions I should be available to answer them in about an hour or so, got some grocery shopping to do but after that I&#39;ll be close by the computer for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree the rule should be in the sidebar.  I&#39;ve said to other mods before that not only is it difficult for the user to know what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s difficult for me as a mod to know what to remove and what to not remove if the rules aren&#39;t clearly posted.   I&#39;m one of the most junior mods on the subreddit, though, and can&#39;t edit the sidebar myself.  </p>

<p>I think the only other rule we enforce that isn&#39;t posted on the sidebar is removing hate speech, and it has to be pretty hateful to get it removed.  Not like criticizing Israel, more like having a block of all caps racial slurs.</p>

<p>An idea I&#39;ve seen floated here was a list of removed links for the users to see what&#39;s being removed and why.  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that but it&#39;d be the admins who&#39;d have to get that running and I have no clue how that process works, I imagine it&#39;s whenever they get the time for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are underestimating the difference. </p>

<p>Fox News is bought and paid for by the Republican establishment and does far more than tilt. The Democrats tilt to the right, the Republicans are the right. </p>

<p>In the same way that Fox repeats the talking points of the party, RT provides exactly the message the Russian government feels will generate the most dissent in the US. </p>

<p>Is there a difference? Of course. Are they both fundamentally lacking objectivity? Yes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s debatable which is more effective as they cater to different demographics. But they are both unquestionably propaganda machines. </p>

<p>RT is owned by the Russian government in the same way the CIA is &quot;owned&quot; by the US government.  If RT is like anything in the US it is like the White House pressroom....and you guys believe it like it&#39;s gospel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That RT video doesn&#39;t appraise viewers of any facts as far as I can tell. Where are these 120 french soldiers? Where is the footage of them? Why on earth would there be HUNDRED AND TWENTY french soldiers loitering around homs? 
Hell, if you try to google around a bit, all the results are abovetopsecret, blogs, or conspiracy sites. Not a single trustworthy news source has reported on this- and RT as a Russian government propaganda machine definitely does not count as trustworthy.</p>

<p>I am 99% certain this is bullshit, and probably the last we&#39;ll hear of it, and not because it&#39;s &quot;hushed down&quot;, but because it simply didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>E; Downvoting this post won&#39;t make the news story any more valid or true. Feel free to come back and upvote it once a couple of weeks have passed without anyone mentioning this &quot;breaking news&quot; ever again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having spent three years studying media, I treat ALL media with a critical eye, be it entertainment, advertisement or news. 
In this specific case, the difference between a lot of the media reporting out of Syria is that there are several independant sources alongside the international media reporting the exact same thing, namely Assad slaughtering civillians, and ONE reporting on these french soldiers being captured, with every other source referring back to the RT newspiece. When that one source of information (in this case RT) is known to hold a strong pro-Assad bias, there&#39;s reason to worry about the authencity of the news being reported- which should be the default way to look at a state owned news organ.
It&#39;s exactly the same as not trusting CNN/Fox/whatever when they&#39;re posting their umpteenth article about Iran&#39;s &quot;nuclear program&quot; while using that same old picture of Ahmadinejad standing in a nuclear reactor. It&#39;s obvious propaganda!</p>

<p>E; For the record, while Al Jazeera is owned by the state of Qatar, they have a pretty good record for being objective in their international news coverage. As for &quot;french media&quot;, that isn&#39;t very specific, but as far as I know the french state doesn&#39;t own any french media groups.
E2: And the BBC is very obviously biased-- but not neccesarily towards the government, but towards the left. The BBC, while state owned, spent a lot of time and energy in the 80s defaming Thatcher and friends, and if I&#39;m to believe conservative complaints coming out of britain to this day, they&#39;re still very, very leftist. :)
I&#39;d rather have a news network that sticks to its guns in a single political direction to the point of it being silly than a news network that blindly reports whatver the government wants it to report, like RT.
Let me just quote RT&#39;s editor in chief, here; </p>

<p>&quot;Margarita Simonyan, the channel&#39;s editor-in-chief, has rejected the allegation that RT broadcasts &quot;Kremlin propaganda&quot; but acknowledged that it strives for a &quot;Russian viewpoint&quot;. She has claimed the channel welcomes controversy, as it &quot;provides an alternative to mainstream media.&quot; She has said the network &quot;takes a pro-Russian position&quot; and has been unrepentant about RT&#39;s pro-Russian coverage of the 2008 Russian-Georgian war.&quot;</p>

<p>With Syria being within the Russian sphere of interest and Assad being a friend of Putin, it&#39;s not really surprising that RT takes a pro-Syrian govt stance. Hell, they&#39;d probably admit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well of course all the sources reporting that Assad is murdering his own people are politically aligned NATO members or their affiliates / bitches.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera has been caught with its pants down before, but I&#39;m sure you know this already.</p>

<p>The problem with comparing what is true and what isn&#39;t by counting sources it obvious.  If there is an effort underway in the NATO affiliated countries&#39; journalistic outlets to shush up this information, something that we both know has been done many times in the past, we won&#39;t hear about it from anybody except the Russians and maybe Iran.</p>

<p>I guess my point is that, while I acknowledge RT&#39;s pro-Russian slant, I also (unlike you) see a nationalistic slant in the BBC, in the French media, and especially in the American media.  The difference is that at least RT has the honesty to admit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong. Most of the sources reporting Assad&#39;s murdering has absolutely nothing to do with NATO, considering that the vast majority of these sources are Syrian.</p>

<p>There is no over-arching conspiracy among all nato-affilated countries to hush down what&#39;s going on in Syria. Most news outlets are not state owned, and not all the news coming out of Syria has anything to do with international professional media. If you seriously buy Assad&#39;s angle on Syria then I just don&#39;t know what to say to convince you. There&#39;s hundreds of non-western news videos out there of Syrians in homs being murdered by its own government. It&#39;s not some huge conspiracy plot to discredit Assad, it&#39;s just a corrupt government cracking down on its own citizens in the most violent way possible. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s a degree of nationalistic slant to every media, but there&#39;s a huge difference between that and being an outright propaganda machine. </p>

<p>Hating America doesn&#39;t mean you have to support its &quot;enemies&quot;, especially not when they&#39;re monstrously in the wrong. Do you really think America is the only nation with international interests? What makes you think Russia is above lying to protect and promote its interests?</p>

<p>Same with Iran, I completely support their right to a nuclear program and I think it&#39;s abhorrent that the international community sanctions a country (and threatens war) for wanting to expand their energy availability and efficiency; that does NOT mean I take their news at face value, and nor should you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one would have a hard time proving that twitter messages and Youtube videos are actually coming from any particular point on the globe.  There are already some pretty damning videos from &quot;somewhere&quot; that show Syrians constructing fake massacres, and other videos purporting to be from Syria that have been shown to have been from Lebanon during the Israeli aggression there a few years back.  All of this makes it somewhat difficult to believe the media outlets and take their reportage at face value, and it makes it especially difficult to believe the Syrians who are agitating for revolution there.  Who knows where they even are?</p>

<p>I find your conclusion that there is no over-arching conspiracy strange, in that there is evidence of manipulation of facts and wholesale creation of narratives going on all the time in the Middle East.  Of course, Homs has had its difficulties with Assad&#39;s father in the past, and it is only natural for them to be a bit agitated.  Their proximity to a foreign nation that has serious relationship problems with Syria and a good relationship with the West makes it the perfect stage for a foreign-supported insurgency.</p>

<p>You do betray yourself with your comment about &quot;hating America&quot; though.  I thought this conversation would be genuine until I read that particular tired old bit of slander.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you catch the Russian accent of the reporter?  RT is a Kremlin propaganda mouthpiece and thus has about as much credibility as the Assad regime&#39;s official propaganda outlets.  Did you notice the total lack of any video of the French troops captured?  I can show you IED videos of rebels hitting Assad&#39;s forces but they can&#39;t produce any kind of video?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get butthurt, your submission was marked as spam because it is.  It lacks any kind of verifiability and is coming from a party with a clear vested interest in the situation.  RT is literally owned by the Russian government.  Say what you will about the American media, they are all privately held companies. </p>
