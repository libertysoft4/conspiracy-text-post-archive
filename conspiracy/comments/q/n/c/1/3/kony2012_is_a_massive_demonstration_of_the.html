<p>Good job, Bernays</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, this is a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>. Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and he literally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_(book)">wrote the book on propaganda</a>. Here&#39;s an excerpt from that book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. [...] In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons [...] who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernays worked with and for U.S. presidents and American corporations, with the goal of implementing his uncle&#39;s theories. If you want to know more about how incredibly influential he was, I&#39;d suggest watching this documentary: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kintd8YC4Ow">The Century of the Self</a>. It&#39;s 4 hours long, but it&#39;s probably the most important thing I&#39;ve ever seen. At least watch the first hour if you can. It&#39;s not the typical bullshit conjecture/amateur fearmongering you&#39;d expect; this is a BBC documentary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this on a group my city formed in response to Kony 2012.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just so you can get a clear message of the solution your supporting: You want to send our military to Africa to aid the Ugandan military in stopping Kony. A military I might add that has been itself accused of many atrocities such as looting, rape, and also recruiting child soldiers. (source: <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2008/10/07/could-the-us-prosecute-ugandan-military-officials-for-using-child-soldiers/">http://opiniojuris.org/2008/10/07/could-the-us-prosecute-ugandan-military-officials-for-using-child-soldiers/</a> )</p>

<p>Now what is it that a military knows how to do well? Kill the enemy. The enemy is Kony, SURROUNDED by brainwashed children. IC says they don&#39;t want to kill him but bring him to justice but the only way a military is going to be able to capture this man is through force in which there will most definitely be casualties being the children.
MILITARY INTERVENTION IS NOT THE ANSWER and supporting a corrupt military is definitely not going to help either.</p>

<p>IC is not clear AT ALL on how they intend to capture this man. Ugandan military has NO jurisdiction in any other part of Africa other than Uganda so how could our military intervention be of any use in capturing Kony when the Ugandan Military can&#39;t go after him?</p>

<p>I hate to be the one to go into conspiracy&#39;s but this one reeks of it. Uganda has recently been home to the discovery of oil on its land. Enough oil to generate $2 billion dollars a year. THIS is a very logical reason to why our military wants to get involved in Uganda, they just needed public support and through the propaganda fed to you by this video, they now have it. 
Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/world/africa/uganda-welcomes-oil-but-fears-graft-it-attracts.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/world/africa/uganda-welcomes-oil-but-fears-graft-it-attracts.html</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t let your emotions take over your logical reasoning. This war on Kony is on it&#39;s last leg as he has been banished to the jungle. He is no where near as big of a threat as this video exclaims him to be. Our current support under this solution will do NOTHING to help capture Kony.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to see people uniting under a great cause but there are motives behind this organization that they are not telling us. I am urging you to listen to reason and stop support for this cause. If you TRULY want to make a difference then warn and educate people of what they are really buying into! IC has no credible sources of anyone outside of themselves supporting their movement. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid of changing your stance on this matter just because you began supporting this and feel the need to follow through. Here are many other organizations for people to support if they truly want to make a difference in Africa but just as this one, please research what exactly you are supporting.

</blockquote>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
The solution that IC is promoting is very flawed.
They want to militarize Uganda.
Uganda recently discovered shit tons of oil on their land.
Possible reason to want public support for their operations.</p>

Were you okay with the countless other murderous African dictators over the past 3 decades who did the same things with zero fucks given from NATO or other international bodies?

Would you stick an M4 in your son&#39;s hand to send him to fight and potentially die for these Africans?  That&#39;s the action that would need to happen to remove a man like Kony from power, and I will not support spending American blood and treasure to kill some African gang leader.  I wish the African people would organize on their own and take their continent back from murderous thugs.  I wish that for all peoples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even know if this is the right place to post this, but this video was the slickest thing I&#39;ve ever seen for a &quot;movement&quot; bit. Slicker than &quot;Yes We Can&quot; by a long mile. Here are just a few reasons.</p>

<p>• It would appear as though our narrator/hero has been followed by a camera crew for most of his adult life. Some of the shots are the kinds you&#39;d expect to see - he and his friends speaking in lecture halls, etc. Some are borderline - he and his friends walking through the airport, shot from the back, etc. Some are definitely not - for some reason he and his wife allowed a camera person into the delivery room while she was getting a c-section. </p>

<p>• The post work is stellar. And very, very expensive. This is a bit confusing, as sometimes we&#39;re supposed to be watching fly on the wall style, and sometimes they&#39;ve blown out the work to include sets, effects, animation, etc. Even the close-ups of social media sites were expensive to do. You can&#39;t point a camera at a computer. All of that clicking and typing on screen and cursor movement needs to be animated. Again, expensive.</p>

<p>• But mainly, every single second of this video was brilliantly scripted. Every movement, every nuance, everything. From his kid blowing up the grocery store clerk&#39;s butt with the iPhone app to the hopeful young people looking up at camera (which would have necessitated a crane shot). This was unbelievably well thought through. </p>

<p>This is, in short, the absolute best advertisement I have ever seen in my life.</p>

<p>Now it might be a brilliant ad for a brilliant reason, but with a charity that&#39;s on record as having spent just 32% of what it raked in on directly helping people in Uganda, I gotta wonder what their total take has been to date.</p>

<p>Again, this is incredibly expensive, incredibly well written and in my mind, just incredibly weird.</p>

<p>And I had a young woman LITERALLY WALK UP TO ME IN A STORE this afternoon and ask me if I&#39;d seen the video and if I&#39;d like a poster.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s working. And I&#39;m kinda freaked out about the whole thing.</p>
