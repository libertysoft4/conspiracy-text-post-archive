    <div class="md"><p><em>The Facts So Far</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>$15,000,000,000,000.00 in Bonds (3 pieces of paper) are claimed as being fake.</p></li>
<li><p>There is signed letter from Ben Bernake (Fed. Bank of New York Signatory) saying &quot;Yes the Bonds are Real and we have them here in New York in our safe&quot; ... again these certificates are claimed as being fake.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is how Big Money deals happen ... Mr. Richie Richie says, &quot;Yo I got big bond$ and here&#39;s a signed letter from the Head Honcho of Big Bank Corporation saying that too.&quot;  &quot;So let&#39;s make a deal give me ca$h and the Head Honcho of Big Bank Corporation will send you the big bond$&quot;</p>

<p>Now the MSM is saying ... &quot;Fake! Fake! Who the Hockey Puck would print or buy $5 Trillion dollar pieces of paper?&quot; ... and officially the Fed claims not to print bonds this large ... only a Nigerian prince would have that kind of paper money and if you could just wire $5000 to help him pay off a corrupt judge he&#39;ll be happy to share his gazzilions of dollars ... so it is a scam, right?</p>

<p>It smells like one now doesn&#39;t it?   The seemingly baffled old man pitching it does not help either.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the kink ... </p>

<ul>
<li>The Lord Blackheath claims to  have evidence that HSBC and then Royal Bank of Scotland took hold of this $15 Trillion and claimed it as &quot;on thier books&quot; ... this is the key.</li>
</ul>

<p>If major UK banks held, loaned out against, and collected BIG $$$$ on interest using a suposed FAKE bonds ... well then we got a major Con spire race you see to make money by fraud ... BAM ... major UK banks caught red handed.  </p>

<p>If the $15 Trillionare from a secret &quot;Indo-China Dynasty&quot; is a fraudster well ...  HSBC and then Royal Bank of Scotland are guilty the same.</p>

<p>@fragglemook adds what maybe the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Not only did HSBC and then Royal Bank of Scotland need a quick shot of $15T in moo-lah ... just to keep from going the way of Leaman Bros ... but this is the tip of a $600 trillion scam (about $850,000 for every person on the planet).</p>

<p>So is there $600 trillion in contracts &quot;off balance sheet&quot; money floating about the Wall St. / London elite?</p>

<p>Like we&#39;ll ever get an official confirmation on that ;/ </p>

<p>But here is food for thought ... this story is coming from a Lord of Her Majesties Realm he is speaking in a room where you can clearly see Her Majesties Throne ... that is where she sits a Rules over the Lords of the British Empire ... she is being called to (re)action ... and you do not get much higher up the ladder than this.</p>

<p>Lord Blackheath is saying to the Queen (and the other Lords) &quot;Hey some one is fucking with the Rules of Our game&quot;  &quot;And we (Royal Peers) need to know what is going on!&quot;</p>

<p>A.  This is a cheap scam and our bankers need to clean house?  Let&#39;s crack the whip!</p>

<p>B.  This is our scam of robbing $15 Trillion from a secret &quot;Indo-China Dynasty&quot;?  In that case, my bad, carry on!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is easy to discount Lord James of Blackheath as a crazy old man, what with the whole &quot;Foundation X&quot; fiasco (look that one up), BUT the Honorable Lord DID serve as a &quot;Money Cop&quot; for GB for several years, and does have quite some experience.  To add to discrediting Lord James, one of the few names he dropped, Yohannes Riyadi, is steeped in controversy.
Is there a &quot;REAL&quot; Yohannes Riyadi, who&#39;s named is being used in multiple fraud cases?  Or is the whole thing a giant &quot;Nigerian&quot; scheme?  <strong>HUGE</strong> questions, and like I said, we still need more information...but no one is putting it out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>600 trillion is estimated to be the amount of off balance sheet money in circulation around the world. this 15t is alleged to be from the federal reserve bank of ny.  allegedly, as one of the theories go, they have transferred it to UK banks as a loan so that the UK economy and the euro economy looks better on paper so Greece doesn&#39;t have to officially a.d legally default on its loans. if they are in default, like if you can&#39;t pay your mortgage, then a swathe of financial instruments called Credit Default Swaps become due to be paid back by wall st banks. if they have to actually pay the total cds, well It&#39;s just unpayable because its all fake money, fraudulent financial instruments with no basis in a lawful contract. so if they have to pay that off, they can&#39;t because the sums would be exponential and would collapse a bunch of the wall st banks. thus the us economy.</p>

<p>I used to read christopher story, the world report and wasn&#39;t entirely sure about its veracity until I saw him give a talk on the eu.  if you want to comprehend the lawfulness of this whole thing and the money system, read a short book, say 100 pages on contract law. everything is contract. especially money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeh credit default swaps are a derivative contract. they&#39;re derived from an underlying asset. they have no intrinsic value themselves, not like a paper that says you own a barrel of oil for example.</p>

<p>as for your second question, the dollar is already worthless, it just happens to be accepted in exchange for goods and services. this is why the price of gold has shot up.  golds value has always been the same, its just that you need more and more dollars to pull it from the earth.  the dollar is running on fumes right now.  collapse is happening now. its being controlled.  google sebaygo1.  plenty of podcasts there to instruct you.  can you feed yourself with dollars? nope. you have to exchange them for something to eat. what if nobody takes your dollar? hmm. I personnally suspect that security agencies worldwide are working on a peer to peer method of trade that will replace money and circumvent governments altogether in anticipation of the total worldwide engineered collapse of the private central banking system. I don&#39;t believe were heading for armageddon.</p>

Since I personally saw the account from Lord James, I&#39;ve spent at the least 10 hours searching for more information.  It appears that this story has fallen into the void.  There has been little to no additional information associated with any of the names listed since the story broke.  As Lord James states, there are three possibilities, and the consensus is that this is just an elaborate scam.  If that is the case, there should CERTAINLY be an investigation.  OR, the Fed has finally be caught doing what many of us have already assumed...and there is an even DEEPER elaborate scam.</p>

<p>We need more information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He claims that these transfers are receipted and acknowledge by the banks. It doesn&#39;t matter if the source of the money is a scam. He is actually saying a scam of some magnitude is occurring, he&#39;s just not sure where the scam starts and ends.</p>

<p>Confirmation or refutation of the receipts by HBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland needs to be made public. He claims you can see that transfer from NY Fed -&gt; Chase -&gt; RBS &amp; HBS. If that is so, they have been caught red handed in then putting fictitious capital to work on the market to reap huge rewards.</p>
