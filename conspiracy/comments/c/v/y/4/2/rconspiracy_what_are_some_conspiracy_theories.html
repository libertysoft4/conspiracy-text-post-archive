    <div class="md"><p>“ [Lewis Tyson and Richard Kahn] argue that the lizards may be allegorical, a Swiftian satire intended to demonstrate the emergence of a global fascist state. In <em>Children of the Matrix</em>, Icke writes that, that if the reptilians did not exist, we would have to invent them. ‘In fact,’ he says, ‘we probably have. They are other levels of ourselves putting ourselves in our face.’ He argues, ‘We are the reptilians and the &quot;demons&quot; and, at the same time, we are those they manipulate because we are all the same &quot;I&quot;.’ Lewis and Kahn make use of Douglas Kellner&#39;s distinction in <em>Media Spectacle</em> (1995) between a reactionary clinical paranoia, a mindset dissociated from reality, and a positive, progressive, critical paranoia, which uses the culture of suspicion to question and confront power. They argue that Icke displays elements of both, writing that what they call his &#39;postmodern metanarrative&#39; may be politically empowering, a way of giving ordinary people a narrative structure with which to question what they see around them. ” - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke#Place_within_the_conspiracism_genre">Source</a> (sic)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m not quite sure what you mean when you say you don&#39;t think UFOs are extraterrestrials. If all your saying is that UFOs are government aircraft, than I agree with you 100%. Most of them are. But if by that you are also implying that aliens from other planets haven&#39;t visited us, and that space craft of alien origin don&#39;t exist, than I have a couple of videos of my own that might change your mind.

<p>No, No No, dude learn to read. 75 percent <em>of the wrongly convicted</em> were convicted because of eyewitness testimony.   The other 25 percent didn&#39;t represent accurate eyewitness testimony, they represented wrongful convictions for other reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey what do you know, I did read it wrong. Imagine me of all people doing that! (incase you havn&#39;t noticed already I have a tendency to overlook small, or sometimes large details. Gets me into trouble in real life too :p)</p>

<p>Ok ok. So maybe the government, or at least what we would call &quot;our&quot; government, is in fact really bad at hiding secrets. I won&#39;t deny that for a second. Maybe what I should have said, is that the &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;black&quot; government are the ones who have done such a good job at hiding this information. Now as to whether or a not a &quot;black&quot; government actually exists, is up for debate in an empirical sense as well. </p>

<p>Well this conversation is basically going nowhere :p I still believe that aliens have visited us, and you still have perfectly logical reasons to believe elsewise. This is starting to sound a lot like the God debate. It just so happens that I do believe in God as well as Aliens. So just out of curiosity, not looking for an argument here or anything as I am done debating :p, but do you believe in God or no?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Interesting you should ask.  In the strictest sense, no.  I consider the chances of a Christian anthropomorphic god so unlikely as to not even be considered.  Same with most of popular theologies.  I do however accept the possibilities that higher forms of life might exist, and might even be likely.  The chances of a being creating the universe, however, seem far less likely than it occurring from natural phenomenon.  And much like I have no interest or ability to communicate with an ant, a higher species would very likely be unable or uninterested in interaction with, let alone demanding worship by, a lower form of life.  And no accepting that possibility doesn&#39;t mean I think UFO phenomenon are any more likely to be natural phenomenon either.  Accepting you don&#39;t know shit doesn&#39;t mean you get to start making shit up to fill the holes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah now, I didn&#39;t make up the idea of a secret government by a long shot. Maybe you&#39;ve heard of the Illuminati, New World Order, etc? I didn&#39;t come up with this stuff.</p>

<p>I believe in God, but similar to you I don&#39;t view God as an actual being, at least not in the normal sense. I don&#39;t think some giant dude in the sky with a beard just one day decided, fuck it, I want to create life!</p>

<p>God is simply love and acceptance of all things. In a sense god is simply a feeling that everyone holds in their hearts, in one way or another. But if you want to get into what god actually IS, I believe it has much to do with other dimensions/planes of existence, and is therefore something that we as simple humans could never understand, atleast while we remain on this plane of existence.</p>

<p>Even if it IS hundreds attesting, you flat out lie when you say &#39;cover-up of <em>alien</em> contact&#39;.  At most hundreds of people have seen weird shit, with varied opinions on the source of the anomalies, and none of whom have provided <em>any</em> physical evidence.  </p>

<p>Telling the truth about what they saw? Yes.  Able to accurately attribute said phenomenon to the non-terrestrial?  Most certainly not.   Its a pretty basic example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My source is the first video I posted entitled &quot;the disclosure project&quot;. This is a collection of interviews of military personnel edited down from literally hundreds of different interviews. These were all interviews from the year 2001 alone. Military personnel from as far back as the 1950&#39;s, such as Major Donald Keyhoe, have publicly stated their belief in alien contact. </p>

<p>You are definitely right about confirmation bias though, as this could be used to explain many of the claims. But than many of these claimed sightings of alien craft and even contact with alien beings are described in great detail. These aren&#39;t just the odd sightings of a moving light up in the sky. I don&#39;t know the exact science behind confirmation bias, but I would guesstimate that a highly detailed claim would make a story less likely to be attributable to C.B. Of course these people could have just been dreaming/hallucinating, or just plain lying of course. But than maybe they weren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hundreds of people interacted with aliens and not one, not a single one, has a single physical artifact?  That is patently absurd.  These arguments from authority are based on random phenomenon observed in the sky, or rumor, or conjecture, or the least likely - dreaming/hallucination.  The interpretations drawn are classic confirmation bias.  If they had real hands on experience at least one of them would have something physical to show for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you watched the video &quot;the disclosure project&quot;? It&#39;s in one of the links in my previous posts in this thread. These claims from the military sound pretty far removed from a simple phenomenon in the sky. </p>

<p>As for evidence, I believe there are groups of influential people in our society that will do everything in their power to hide any sort of physical evidence relating to alien visitation, and they do a damn good job of hiding it. The reason they have such a tight lock on alien technology? Well, I believe it has something to do with zero-point energy. More specifically, it has a whole lot to do with the fact that the revelation of functional zero-point energy technology would make the fossil fuel industry go out of business over-night. </p>

<p>It is the criminals, nay, the scum of this earth, who own the fossil fuel industries, these are the ones who are behind the alien cover-up. Who else would have enough money and resources to pull such a thick sheet of wool over our eyes? The government certainly doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just alien technology they&#39;re hiding either. This goes all the way back to famed inventor Nikola Tesla. He was actually the first person to create a functional zero-point energy device, all the way back in the mid 1880s! His technology, and that of other inventors have been subdued and hidden by the oil industry throughout history. Look up an inventor named Adam Trombly, founder of Project Earth, for a more recent example of this cover-up. I know that you definitely won&#39;t believe any of this. But maybe someone else reading this will take a look and decide to do some of their own research...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, UFOs are definitly part man made part Extra terrestrial, I know that some of you would like to believe that the entire ET thing is 100% distraction from the real NWO banking oligarchy issues that are more tangible, but Im sorry there are too many credible NASA UFO videos from ORBIT of craft flying around at 200,000MPH that cannot, I repeat CANNOT be soley human in origin.  These UFOs are sometimes backengineered, and just accept the fact that there are ETs and yes theve been here for a while but no I dont have any evidence that they have controlled or influenced Earth Politics but with all the ancient astronaut history its hard to believe ETs havent been here a looong long time.</p>

<p>If they are real they wouldnt have ONLY shown up in the last 100 years, and they also would have not been able to not contact at least some humans who of course noone would believe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s think this through.  Proof that NASA landed men on the Moon in &#39;69 - if untrue, Russia would present humiliating proof of the fakery.  Since there was no Russian (or other county) public proof or claims, no more reason to doubt.
Possibilities:
- Successful landing, nothing to see here.
- NASA very adeptly faked it, Russia was fooled as well
- Faked, Russia is wise to the scam, but lacks adequate proof.
- Faked, Russia has the proof.  Makes a sweet deal in exchange for silence.
-Faked, Russia can prove, but diplomacy prevails and Russia avoids any tit-for-tat publicity. </p>

<p>Precedence:
Russia has a history of secret launches and astronaut deaths, since proven, that the US never made public but certainly knew about.</p>

<p>China&#39;s Shezhou 7 spacewalk in &#39;08 was certainly faked, while NASA stayed silent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things for me that prove the landing wasn&#39;t fake:</p>

<p>1: There&#39;s corner reflectors up there.</p>

<p>2: The number of people involved would mean someone would leak information.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I also think the video&#39;s were faked. Why?</p>

<p>Well, maybe the radiation bleached the film while they were up there, so they had to re-shoot the scenes back on earth otherwise it would be a massive embarrassment to America... first man on the moon, but no film to show for it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They know that in the evolution of our species there is an obvious pattern. The longer we are around, the more distracted we are from being our true selves. working/evolving with each other and nature for causes that do not involve killing ourselves. </p>

<p>These distractions, naturally caused by human nature and technology, also causes this &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; thing. People eat, drink, and smoke terrible things without question. This same concept seems to be everywhere, not just consumption.</p>

<p>So, throughout history these people have used this knowledge to help push these ideas subtly (our terrible educational systems, injected meats and foods, wars, diseases, etc) . Thus, &quot;indirectly&quot; reducing the population through covert means.  </p>

<p>I have no idea what is coming next,. I just know that by acknowledging these things and separating my thoughts from other peoples ideas, I am a little more prepared than most people </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, for example, from the Ivy League entry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This extreme numerical over-representation of Jews among the senior administrators of the Ivy League colleges and universities cannot be explained away as a coincidence or as the result of mere random chance. You must ask yourself how such an incredibly small and extremely unrepresentative minority ethnic group that only represents 2% of the American population could so completely dominate the administration of America&#39;s leading colleges and universities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have asked myself this question, and the conclusion I have come to is that the Jews are over-represented in the fields of academia, various sciences, finance, media, information technology etc., because they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>studious</li>
<li>often of extremely high intelligence</li>
<li>driven by culture and family to achieve in these fields (the best revenge is to live well)</li>
<li>greed<sup>H<sup>H<sup>H<sup>H<sup>H</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> fiscally astute</li>
<li>nepotistic, tribal, conspiratorial?</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps that is a stereotype, but if you&#39;ve taken a look at the kabbalah and other jewish religious teachings, you&#39;d see that they are extremely complex and require years of deep study and research. Much like the hindu religion(s), studying this shit requires a lot of hard work and brainpower, and makes you a smarter and more capable adult than the average TV-raised dumbed down westerner.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m stereotyping but I&#39;ve spent years looking into this stuff and have yet to be convinced that the Jewish World Conspiracy theory is more compelling that the Diverse Rich Fuckers World Conspiracy theory (a theory that allows for over-representation of Jews amongst the Diverse Rich Fuckers, due to reason outlined above).</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not through lack of research or ignorance... I&#39;ve told you before I&#39;ve read much of TIU and listened to lots of their podcasts etc. I&#39;ve seen everything on WRH and listened to everything Texe Marrs has put out. I&#39;ve lurked stormfront and just finished reading On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced, and despite the recent rise in postings to this subreddit regarding the Jewish World Conspiracy, I don&#39;t think many of us here are convinced either.</p>

<p>But as usual I&#39;ll get downvoted for this...</p>

<p>At the moment though I am quite sober as it is only midday here. If anything I&#39;ve had way too much coffee this morning.</p>

<p>I agree with the whole nepotism/tribalism thing, it is quite obvious, and it supports what I&#39;ve said above. It doesn&#39;t support the overall One World Jewish Order conspiracy theory (well, that theory necessitates a Jew Hive Mind with a singular objective I suppose).</p>

<p>As for thinking Jews are somehow better/smarter me, I would never do such a thing. There&#39;s only a handful of people in the world I consider smarter than myself :)</p>

<p>Asians do the nepotism thing too. I think the Japanese are notorious for this, but my friends tell me the Chinese are becoming this way too. The Jews have a much older and established base within the annals of power, finance etc... maybe in 20 years we&#39;ll be talking about the Chinese World Order conspiracy theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course that&#39;s true! Oswald was a sentient extra-terrestrial able to bend time and space to allow a single bullet to go through all the exit wounds and ricocheting in the motorcade. It all makes sense, sheeple!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What &quot;magic&quot; bullet? Shot lines up perfectly (see my above link). Everybody just assumes Connelly was sitting <em>directly</em> in front of JFK. When in fact he was sitting slightly to the left, a little lower, and had his body turned. Once when you take into account all these factors, the shot lines up perfectly <strong>in a straight line</strong>.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to have studied it very closely. Why did all the people run up the grassy knoll toward where they thought the shot came from? Why was his body mutilated and stolen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t need to. Oh and it wasn&#39;t a straight line. Even public school textbooks show that it wasn&#39;t a straight line, hence the magic bullet theory.</p>

<p>PS.  Just to clarify...  The NWO actually IS a conspiracy, and it actually IS real.  I just used it to point out that the people who rail against it, haven&#39;t really thought it out that thoroughly...</p>
