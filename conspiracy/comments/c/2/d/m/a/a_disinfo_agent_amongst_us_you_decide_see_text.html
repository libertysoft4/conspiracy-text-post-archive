        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disinfo agent or not, I&#39;m pretty damned convinced that this matts2 dude is purposefully deceitful.  Check out this series of comments (and rebuttals) on just one comment thread, and notice how no matter how many times you correct him, he repeats the same lies (and adds more).</p>

<p>Yeah, I know- he was &quot;called out&quot; already in <a href="/r/shill">/r/shill</a>.  Well, here&#39;s some more ammo for you guys :)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  Are you planning on taking arms against the U.S.? If not, your fear level can be significantly lowered.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>:  There&#39;s no trial to determine this with this bill. The State Department can just accuse you, and off you go.</p>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  To actually come under this you have to actually take up arms. </p>

<p><strong>note</strong> Notice how you completely ignore the significance of the fact that the State Department just needs to accuse you , and off you go.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pos9b">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pos9b</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  All this bill actually does is add &quot;fighting against the U.S. for an organization&quot; to the list of reasons you can lose your citizenship. </p>

<p><strong>note</strong> You&#39;re ignoring the no trial part again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pov6d">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pov6d</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  There is due process. The law has been in place since 1940 and courts have ruled on it.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> Again, a lie.  This new bill has the distinction of removing due process from the equation.  Notice how you keep repeating this again and again, even after you&#39;ve been corrected repeatedly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0ppoky">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0ppoky</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  Material support is a stupid standard. But, even so, you still have to explicitly renounce your citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>gemini_dream</strong>:  No. That is why people are upset about this bill. There is a group of acts that indicate that you intend to voluntarily renounce your citizenship - such as enlisting in a foreign military that is engaged in hostilities against the US - and it is this group that Leiberman wants to amend to include material support.
 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pp768">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pp768</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  The legal games played by the Bush administration had nothing at all to do with citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> You&#39;re really annoying the hell out of me with this one.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The camp - often simply called &quot;Gitmo&quot; and symbolised by the orange jumpsuits worn by prisoners in the earlier stages - remains intensely controversial. </p>

<p>It is seen by the Bush administration as a vital tool in the &quot;war on terror&quot;. *<em>It is one that enables suspects who are not US citizens to be interrogated and held, indefinitely if necessary, in a US-controlled territory but not subject to normal US court rules. *</em></p>

<p>Critics say it is a legal black hole in which suspects have been abused and face either military tribunals or open-ended imprisonment. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pp21y">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pp21y</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  This law already exists and cases have come to the Supreme Court. It is not exactly a massive (or tiny) increase in government power. The only change is adding &quot;foreign organization&quot; along side &quot;foreign state&quot;. In either case you have to explicitly try to give up your citizenship. Simply joining another army, even attacking American troops, is not enough to give up citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong>  Again, see above.  Another lie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pp21y">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pp21y</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Now you do say &quot;Yes true. The Supreme Court has ruled on this several times.&quot;  But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the Obama adminstration and many others are speaking favorably of the bill and/or are outright supporting it, and it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s a terrible bill.  </p>

<p>i.e. You&#39;re still lying because you assert that the bill doesn&#39;t remove due process, and when you&#39;re confronted with this, you say that what you really meant was that the supreme court ruled on the basic idea years ago as &quot;unconstitutional&quot;.</p>

<p>So you tell me- given all the rather arguably unconstitutional shit that&#39;s been passed under the nose of the Supreme Court lately, what makes you think it&#39;s a sure thing that this won&#39;t as well?  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  The law that the bill sets out to change. It is not a punishment, so there is no trial. It is a State Dept determination that can be challenged.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>:  It&#39;s not a punishment??? What about all the things that follow- like being put in a legal black hole where the government can do pretty much anything and everything to you, like, say, what they&#39;re already doing to people in Gitmo/Bagram?</p>

<p>It is a State Dept determination that can be challenged.</p>

<p>Yeah. Sure. Unless you have a lot of money for a brilliant legal team and years in court, prepare to have the cards massively stacked against you if you&#39;re ever in this situation. The f&#39;ing burden of proof is on the accused to prove their innocence. That&#39;s just twisted.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> Your assertion here is just f&#39;n retarded.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pour5">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pour5</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  She would not have powers she does not already have. The bill adds to the list of reasons the State Department can use.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> Again, another lie.  It gives the power to strip citizenship without trial.  That&#39;s a pretty significant power.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pot03">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c1upp/even_hillary_clinton_is_throwing_her_support/c0pot03</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>matts2</strong>:  I missed the &quot;throwing her support behind&quot; part. And it is not clear at all how this is supposed to work. If it is after a trial I don&#39;t see it as terrible. She is clearly talking about naturalized citizens, not natural born.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>:  There is no trial before they revoke your citizenship on the mere basis of an accusation. That&#39;s why this is bad.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong>  The article also says that she &quot;appeared to have embraced&quot; the bill.  And it&#39;s pretty damn obvious that she is expressing support for the bill&#39;s premise.  Of course, this will devolve into a game of semantics so I&#39;ll just leave it at that and let the reader decide on this one.</p>

<p>Notice my gripe is about lack of evidence.  Now I&#39;m not calling matts2 a &quot;shill&quot;, but I do think he&#39;s clearly, and intentionally, dishonest.  The &quot;disinfo agent&quot; part is in quotations for a reason- I don&#39;t know, nor do I have proof, but hell, if anybody is one, you might just think he&#39;s it :)  But people should be aware of how dishonest he is when reading his comments.</p>

<p>matts2 you have a clearly established pattern of trolling articles relating to Israel and neo-conservative political machinations. Everyone who has ever encountered you and has spent more than a few minutes reading your post history is aware of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You lied and said I provided no evidence. You claimed that your &quot;gripe&quot; was that I did not provide evidence. I provide the evidence yet again and you say we have already discuss this. I am sorry that you did not grasp that this was an old law, I am sorry you misunderstood what Lieberman was doing. But man up and admit you were ignorant and wrong. The State Dept <em>today</em>, right now, has the ability to revoke citizenship. You said Lieberman wanted to give them this power, you were <em>wrong</em>. They have had the power for 70 years. </p>

<p>But you are not going to man up, you already ran to this circlejerk and whined that mean ol&#39; Matt mistreated you. And when I gave you these specific pieces of information that you said did not exist and gave you what you said was what you wanted you closed your eyes and started humming to yourself. And all of the jerks in the circle agreed with each other and voted all of you up and voted anyone that disagrees or has actual information down. </p>

<p>I have not come across any part of reddit, and few if any places on the &#39;net in general, so unwilling to look at or even acknowledge evidence that conflicts with your predetermined answers. Anyone who disagrees is put on a list and downvoted by the group. You have pet names for people who dare to disagree and dare to actually back up their disagreement with evidence. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a rather odd claim, considering the definition of minutia is:  &quot;precise details; small or trifling matters&quot;.  So you&#39;re saying that arguing whether or not a bill gives the State Department the power to strip you of your citizenship without a trial is arguing &quot;minutia&quot;?  Wow.</p>

(The government is going to have the ability to strip citizenship arbitrarily vs this is nothing new) The truth of the proposed bill is in between both your views (IMO closer to yours), and neither of you seems to be willing to concede any ground and reassess you view.

<p><strong>matts2</strong>  The bill gives no new powers, and that the citizen still has to explicitly revoke their citizenship.   Oh, also, the bill provides for due process (but then it doesn&#39;t once I&#39;m called out on this because revoking citizenship is not a &quot;punishment&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One more time: the State Dept already has the power to strip citizenship. This proposal adds two criteria to the list they can use, it does not add more power. That is not questionable, that is the law. I have given you references to that law, you don&#39;t want to look at the evidence. The Supreme Court, in rulings I have referenced, said you have to explicitly revoke your citizenship. The bill does allow for due process, that has already been tested in court. If there is no middle ground then the problem is that your won&#39;t bother to look at a 70 year old law and court rulings decades old. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not on an extreme here. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1481.html">law</a> exists. That is not opinion, that is not something reasonable people can differ about. The law exists. Lieberman wants to <em>add</em> criteria to the law. One of those criteria, adding &quot;organization&quot; seems reasonable to me, one, adding &quot;material support&quot;, seems like a very bad idea. That does not put me at an extreme, it actually puts me <em>against</em> the bill. </p>

<p>The law does not allow &quot;arbitrary&quot; revocation of citizenship, there is a specific list. After the Sec of State makes a determination there is a departmental review. If you don&#39;t like that answer, then you can go to court. That is not arbitrary, that is actually constrained and there is due process.</p>

<p>As for reassessing, I missed the &quot;material support&quot; aspect the first time and so was abivalent about the bill. When that was pointed out (by someone else, all citnaj does is whine) I changed my position. </p>

<p>As for multiple accounts, I have this one. No matter how many times here I get accused of having several it is false. Not only is this my only account, but whiny babies here have tracked down my irl identity since I have used this name for a very long time. Facts don&#39;t affect cowards like that though.</p>

<p>Of course, not alone, but the memering effect is huge.  I tend to think of things this way as a computer programmer and student of AI techniques.  Actually, there&#39;s a great TED talk that just came out today that goes over the power of social networking:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U-tOghblfE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U-tOghblfE</a></p>

<p>Think about it this way:  Reddit has about 500,000 vistors a day, who in turn overlap into Digg and other social networks.  Contrary to your claim that this isn&#39;t going to have an impact, using these networks to leverage political discussion of key topics is very, very powerful.  </p>

<blockquote>

I am trying to counsel you that it makes you look bad to call foul in an intellectual debate. Let your audience decide. Have more faith both in your own coherence and correctness, and don&#39;t degrade yourself by engaging with a contrarian. I mean you no harm. Your post makes you look petty.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve been reported twice since I started replying to your thread. That is ridiculously petty. Here I am, waiting six minutes to submit this reply. You know, this is a site meant to facilitate the free exchange of ideas. Furthermore, as we attract more people from all walks of life, we are bound to challenge the heartfelt precepts of the core group of users. That is a healthy process, which will inevitably result in the coherent thoughts of our most cogent users being brought to more and more citizens. Your attitude is anti-democratic, and that makes me worry for your soul. The site will be fine, but we might be better off without the likes of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still read this subreddit occasionally, but I stopped posting months ago. I was labeled a government agent, a shill, mossad agent, and all kinds of crap. I just stopped posting here, it&#39;s not worth my time to deal with these types of personalities. In the long run I&#39;m much happier not dealing with these mentally inferior arguments, who rather than talk and debate, would rather insult, attack, and label people as something they could never prove.</p>

<p>Everything that gets posted here is the opposite of what a real scientific process looks like. Perfect example, this post has more comments than anything else posted here in quite awhile, and it&#39;s all about a baseless accusation of people labeling someone without any facts or evidence. &quot;This guy disagreed with me every time I posted, therefore he is a government agent.&quot; They can sugar coat it all they want, but that is really their only argument they have against Matts. They could just ignore him, but they don&#39;t. It makes their group look cooler and wiser if they have government agents who are infiltrating their tightly knit circle of the worlds greatest minds. These people are self centered, and think this knowledge makes them special.</p>

<p>The same people who are so sure Matts2 is a government agent, are the same people who are so sure Jay Z and Lady Gaga are mentally conditioning the masses for the oncoming NWO. They are more concerned with that tabloid bullshit, than they are with what is really going on in the dark corners of politics and world government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more convincing that these lunatics pushing these insane theories are the ones that are the government agents, because any smart and intelligent person that comes here just points, laughs, and leaves, going &quot;Wow, what a crazy bunch of idiots&quot;. I&#39;d say those types are doing more for the government suppression of conspiracies then Matts2 could ever do, because they are the ones that keep the conspiracy communities looking like &quot;a bunch of nuts&quot;. If the intelligent and true skeptics stop posting here, this place will just get dragged further and further into crazy. I&#39;d even say in the last 6 months the stories and comments have gotten even more outlandish around here, if that is even possible. I&#39;m still waiting on my FEMA camps, October Surprises, and Swing Flu death for %90 of the population. When any of this bullshit that gets quoted as fact around here actually happens, maybe I&#39;ll start paying attention to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> prophets again.</p>

<p>But what do I know, I&#39;m just a paid government agent. Figured I&#39;d clock in and get a couple hours today, I&#39;ve been on vacation for almost a year now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, I&#39;m not one to jump on the &quot;he&#39;s a shill&quot; bandwagon.   Nor did I even definitively call the guy a disinfo agent.  I just said- hey look, this guy&#39;s really obviously dishonest- and just merely raised the possibility that he&#39;s a &quot;disinfo agent&quot; because quite frankly he&#39;s quite tenacious about being wrong. </p>

<p>Any, in general, your whole comment is just loaded with straw man arguments and name calling.  And way, way overgeneralizing.  It&#39;s a very tired and boring comment that you see many times on this subreddit in different forms, coming from the same small group of people that for whatever reason can&#39;t seem to get enough of the abuse.</p>

<p>How about, instead, you step in to the debate and tell me why matts2 is correct (despite having been shown to contradict even what Lieberman himself has said about the bill)?</p>

<p>All I did was show matts2 is full of shit.  And you &quot;defenders of the truth&quot; are all going apeshit about it.</p>

<p>Then why did you create a submission entitled &quot;A &quot;disinfo agent&quot; amongst us? You decide (see text).&quot; ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any, in general, your whole comment is just loaded with straw man arguments and name calling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your whole submission is attacking a single user, and calling him a disinfo agent, based on pure speculation. At a maxmimum you believe he actually is an agent, on the minimum you just think he&#39;s an asshole and want the rest of the community to hate him as much as you do. Either way it&#39;s childish, immature, and makes you look like a paranoid moron. My post was the first time I&#39;ve written here in months, almost a year, and I&#39;m the one calling names and insulting people? I&#39;ve never created a submission calling a single user out, nor a group of users. So you won&#39;t convince me, or anyone of any intelligence that I am the one being insulting here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about, instead, you step in to the debate and tell me why matts2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not here to defend Matts2&#39;s innocence or guilt. I really don&#39;t care about him, I care that people make false statements, with no evidence, and try to get people run out of here because they &quot;work for the government cointelpo&quot; or whatever. Its baseless, and you know it, but that doesn&#39;t stop you from trying to get the mob around here just as mad about him as you are. My comment was hidden and down at the bottom, yet people still read it, reply, and get mad. Why can&#39;t you just ignore him? I ignored this subreddit, and after today, will go back to doing the same for the foreseeable future. Why is that so hard for you to do, that it becomes easier to create submissions accusing them of conspiracy bullshit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you &quot;defenders of the truth&quot; are all going apeshit about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not going apeshit, and not a defender of truth, whatever that means. I&#39;m just someone who thinks your a smug know nothing idiot who has proven that to me time and time again by making baseless accusations. So you can say I am using strawman and ad hominem all you want, I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m not trying to convince you of anything. I&#39;m calling you an idiot as flat out as I possibly can, and that is really my only goal. </p>

<p>That being said, this is just my opinion, you&#39;ll notice I will stop there and not try to pass this all off as fact to the rest of the subreddit like you are doing with Matts. This is all just one mans opinion, just like your opinion of Matts. You might not actually be a moron, and he just might not be a government agent. Shocking.</p>

<p>Get over yourself.</p>
