<p>Well, seems the goal is to cool the Earth, so they wouldn&#39;t be very useful at night or when there is already cloud cover.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen them over Cincinnati.  You can watch commercial airlines going into CVG, or just flying over, and they leave a normal contrail.  But, some days, you can watch planes flying in circles leaving these trails.  I&#39;ve watched the same plane for two hours painting the sky, while normal air-traffic leaves normal contrails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t just downvote people that ask for evidence or lack thereof, I&#39;ve always considered this subreddit to be somewhat of a bastion of the anti-hivemind policy. </p>

<p>There was a documentary I saw some time ago on the subject, There are probably many. The evidence presented <em>for</em> was collected samples of air and ground that showed traces of heavy metals and biological agents not native to the area, However, You would really have to test before and after, and verify that testing to be accurate. </p>

<p>The best evidence I&#39;ve seen <em>for</em> the case against chemtrails was this - All planes are tracked by the airport they launch from, you can verify if a plane is commercial, private, or sometimes military. If you think that this may be something you are concerned about, try to get in contact with people in your area who track planes and who they are registered to. </p>

<p>There is a good chance that a lot of &quot;chemtrails&quot; are indeed contrails, or those that have a military purpose are using certain kinds of fuel that don&#39;t behave as normal commercial fuels do. The best way to go about proving this theory would be to collect data off all kinds - Samples, flight data, and anything I might have missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asking me as though you expect me to be an expert. I attempt to be as objective as possible. From my post you could probably infer that I have not done the necessary research myself to state wither it has or has not been done in adequacy. </p>

<p>A large problem surrounding this issue, like many others, is dismissal based on preconceived notions - Social prejudices. If there is no &quot;credible&quot; person willing to do the research, how will it ever be proven or dis proven? Here we reach somewhat of an impasse, for if research is done by the wrong people - It is discredited due to prejudice, However, if no one &#39;credible&#39; is willing to verify or peer review the results - How can we ever come to a solution?</p>

<p>Personally most of the evidence I have briefly reviewed does not meet my own satisfactions of proof, but that doesn&#39;t mean I will bias myself against the theory, only suspend judgment and advocate that idea - that better work should be done to either claim a theory as &#39;proven&#39; or &#39;nonsense&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been to Carnicom before, I just have too many issues with what it presents as &quot;evidence.&quot;  </p>

<p>Take the front page, for example.  We have a series of (rather oddly-formatted) links at the top, but we&#39;ll set those aside for a moment.  Following that, we have 6 thumbnails titled &quot;Aerosol Progression.&quot; It is inferred that these are chemtrails, but with no supporting evidence (and they seem to be contrails exhibiting known behavior from what I can see).  Below that, a picture of the Grand Canyon, titled &quot;&#39;Ideal&#39; Weather Conditions.&quot; No exposition, but I assume we are to take the haziness of the picture as evidence of chemtrails?</p>

<p>Honestly, its not fair to judge a book by its cover, and there are a fairly extensive collection of links on the page.  A good deal have to do with Morgellons (an as-of-yet undefined collection of symptoms) which it attributes to chemtrail operations in the US.  Honestly, the whole Morgellons deal is a big can of worms that will only serve to remove focus from this research, so lets put it aside for now.  </p>

<p>What I&#39;m looking for is verifiable research which shows direct evidence of chemtrail activity.  Ideally, we would be able to find this under the &quot;sampling and analysis&quot; link.  When we click it, we are presented with a few tests on samples (mixed in with a healthy dose of &quot;global warming&quot; sections and various other links which do not pertain to analysis of collected samples).  </p>

<p>So, this would seem to be some sort of concrete evidence.  Indeed, when we look at several of the sample analysis links, we see samples being studied rather scientifically (microscopic study, oil immersion microscopic studies, etc).  So far, so good, right?  </p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s where they lose me.  The second sentence of &quot;sub-micron particles isolated&quot; reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence from this research continues to support the claim of high levels of extremely fine metallic salts within the atmosphere as a consequence of the aerosol operations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study in question involves the collection and isolation of small fibers from an indoor, whole-house ionic filtration system.  At no point is there any real suggestion of the origins of said fibers, and yet the article itself opens with an erroneous claim as to the origins of the fibers in question.  This is a problem in terms of the legitimacy of this study, and it is a common thread through virtually all of the &quot;sampling an analysis&quot; links that have to do with actual scientific obeservations.</p>

<p>Yes, several of these studies do show measurable amounts of heavy metals/salts/unknown material in the air and ground.  But, without fail, each one attributes these materials to &quot;chemtrail operations&quot; without any corroborating evidence.  </p>

<p>I do appreciate the link, and have looked into carnicom&#39;s links extensively before, but while interesting they simply provide no actual evidence of chemtrail operations.</p>

<p>I am still willing to look into any other links provided, with the hopes of some legitimate evidence being presented.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>explain contrails with low humidity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not possible to form contrails below a certain humidity for a given temperature. Keep in mind though that the humidity and temperature on the ground and at 30k+ feet in altitude may vary wildly at any given point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contrails don&#39;t linger for 10 minutes or more</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no reason that they can&#39;t. Contrails will persist until solar irradiation warms the condensed water vapor, or until prevailing winds disperse them. Common atmospheric conditions most probably align to prevent contrails lasting more than a few minutes, but there is nothing that says that they <em>must</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kinda my whole point I guess.  There are lots - <em>lots</em> - of claims floating around out there.  Despite this, I&#39;ve yet to see any hard evidence in support of this theory.</p>

<p>I guess this one is a bit of common sense.  If aircraft are close enough to be in the same photo, they are not going to be routed close to each other in terms of altitude.  Even supposed sinister government agents don&#39;t have death wishes.  </p>

<p>Anyways, atmospheric conditions can be influenced by so, so many factors, altitude among them, and it is almost a guarantee that conditions will no be exactly the same at different altitudes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply,
Well fortunately  these planes are made to spray approx, 1ton  of sulfur dioxide i believe the fatal dose is 2250 ppm per hour with a odor  threshold of .05ppm so it would reek of sulfur before it was doing any harm the way people seem to think. In as small doses as you would be receiving it would be best used for anti-biological warfare. Or to affect the temperature of the earth. I am not saying this is correct but it seems the most plausible from my research especially concerning this specific company. 
I would be more than interested in any other information you might be willing to point me too on this topic.</p>

<p>Yes, contrails can linger if atmospheric conditions allow. Yes, they can even act as seeding agents for clouds. </p>

<p>A good litmus test when researching this subject: if the source claims that contrails cannot linger, and cannot assist in cloud formation, it is most likely a non-reputable one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhhh we start getting into semantics here, you are technically right (as the exhaust vapor does &quot;seed&quot; cloud formation), but generally cloud seeding is thought of as an intentional act to induce rainfall from clouds.</p>

<p>In terms of what they use, it varies.  In general, silver iodide has been the agent of choice, although frozen carbon dioxide is also fairly common.  Propane and salt solutions have also been used to a lesser extent.  </p>

<p>In terms of heavy metals like Barium, there just isn&#39;t much practical utility to their use for seeding.  In fact, if you look into reputable (as in legitimately scientific resources) you won&#39;t find any mention of heavy metals being used in cloud seeding at all; they just don&#39;t work well. </p>

<p>That&#39;s kinda my whole point I guess.  There are lots - <em>lots</em> - of claims floating around out there.  Despite this, I&#39;ve yet to see any hard evidence in support of this theory.</p>

<p>I guess this one is a bit of common sense.  If aircraft are close enough to be in the same photo, they are not going to be routed close to each other in terms of altitude.  Even supposed sinister government agents don&#39;t have death wishes.  </p>

<p>Anyways, atmospheric conditions can be influenced by so, so many factors, altitude among them, and it is almost a guarantee that conditions will no be exactly the same at different altitudes.  </p>
