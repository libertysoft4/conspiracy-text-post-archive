<p>It&#39;s human nature to get involved or upset only when something affects you directly. Not when a mystery is solved from 10-20 years ago. It would have no immediate affect on the general population. Hence, there might be a small ripple from the families of the 3,000 dead. Something like &quot;hey! that ain&#39;t right...but whatcha gonna do?&quot; only to be followed by a big fat nothing.</p>

It should be obvious to anyone with a brain that the Iraq War and The Afghanistan War were both contingent on the event of 9/11.  </p>

<p>Typically, people will push the emotional stress of knowing about 9.11 into their subconscious.  And then they&#39;ll go back to being idiots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine made this journey recently.  It led to a bout of drinking and self destructiveness which, although not unprecedented, was pretty much a direct result of his becoming hopeless about the way the world was going.  I&#39;d hate to see this even partly mirrored on an American/global basis; things could get very messy.  That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s crucial we spend more time exploring how we can get our countries back from the plutocrats who run them for their own amusement and enrichment currently.</p>

<p>Agreed.  The first material step is to depower their &quot;war machine&quot;.   I don&#39;t mean the DoD,  but The Media.   I&#39;m stunned, stunned that anyone still rents a movie or owns a TV,  those monthly checks you write to The Cartel are all they need to enslave us forever.

    <div class="md"><p>For sure.  I was just watching a short documentary called Media and Globalization which covered the role of the indie media, and for example, how the police in Italy raided their offices in Genoa during the G8 meeting there, brutalizing indie journalists and smashing computers, stealing hard drives etc. because they showed the full extent of police violence against demonstrators.

<p>I don&#39;t know if he could disagree.  More than any other president before
him, I think Bush was the most controlled figure head/puppet of any other president in recent history - he was <em>placed</em> in the office by the people around him and <em>they</em> were the ones telling <em>him</em> what to say and do.  Let&#39;s face it, Bush is a man of modest intellect - I don&#39;t think he acted stupid - he really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re overestimating the power and profundity of the White House. Like all presidents, Bush is far, far below the level of those who organized 9/11.

If you recall, Kennedy was killed for threatening the Federal Reserve, the private property of the Jewish mafia.</p>

I think we are of the same mind here and that you simply believe Bush made more of these decisions himself than I believe.  He was told what to say and did.  He still has to be accountable because he accepted the office and took the oath despite being an imbicile.  If you want to discuss this further why not take it up with someone who disagrees with you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting question. I think the fact that these monsters have not been brought to justice has caused many Americans to lose confidence in their government. If they were arrested, tried, convicted and punished, and the constitution restored, I think it would stabilize everything. It is knowing and seeing how they escape punishment that has embittered the American people. </p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about Hunt right?  Yep that sure caused a stir.  People were talking about in line at the supermarket.  The nightly news was abuzz for weeks demanding a new investigation and the release of all still classified evidence.  I thought there might actually be an armed revolution over it.</p>

After 47 years, the JFK assassination is still considered a &#39;mystery&#39;. Lots of people claim they knew a guy who knew a guy who was there, but nobody will ever conclusively know what happened.
