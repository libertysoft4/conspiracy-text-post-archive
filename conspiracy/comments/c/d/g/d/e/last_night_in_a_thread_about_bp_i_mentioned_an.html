        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This hasn&#39;t seemed to have gotten much circulation yet, and I think it really needs to. Seems that a crew from Schlumberger, on contract to BP, hightailed it off the platform at their own expense 6 hours before the blowout because BP refused their recommendation to shut down the well. This lends more credence to Thom&#39;s suggestion that corners were cut because the bigwigs were coming for a vist.</p>

<p>&quot;BP contracted Schlumberger (SLB) to run the Cement Bond Log (CBL) test that was the final test on the plug that was skipped. The people testifying have been very coy about mentioning this, and you’ll see why.</p>

<p>SLB is an extremely highly regarded (and incredibly expensive) service company. They place a high standard on safety and train their workers to shut down unsafe operations.</p>

<p>SLB gets out to the Deepwater Horizon to run the CBL, and they find the well still kicking heavily, which it should not be that late in the operation. SLB orders the “company man” (BP’s man on the scene that runs the operation) to dump kill fluid down the well and shut-in the well. The company man refuses. SLB in the very next sentence asks for a helo to take all SLB personel back to shore. The company man says there are no more helo’s scheduled for the rest of the week (translation: you’re here to do a job, now do it). SLB gets on the horn to shore, calls SLB’s corporate HQ, and gets a helo flown out there at SLB’s expense and takes all SLB personel to shore.</p>

<p>6 hours later, the platform explodes.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth the source of the original text was a random forum posting, saying basically what&#39;s in the text block above.</p>

<p>The Reuters article didn&#39;t come out until 4-5 days after the forum posting, which seems to indicate someone at the news agency following up on this lead, and then confirming it (mostly).  Prior to that forum post, I can&#39;t find anyone discussing SLB even being on the rig.</p>

<p>So, it really does seem that whoever made that original post, really did know what they were talking about, and probably had information that the rest of us do not.</p>

<p>At very least, a larger deal needs to be made out of this so that questions can be raised, because if we just drop leads like this, well.... let&#39;s just say I don&#39;t have much faith in Congress to do any sort of inquiry properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, no. The posting has lots of little bits that point at the SLB employees knowing something about the cause of the blowout. The Reuters story confirms none of those bits. We&#39;re left with the fact that an SLB team left the platform, apparently because their work was done, hours before the explosion. No story yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The original posting correctly states that the CBL test was skipped.</p>

<p>Common sense dictates that since the test wasn&#39;t performed that it wouldn&#39;t be possible to know for sure anything relating to that one way or the other.</p>

<p>The original post does hint that there was some concern by the employees.  </p>

<p>Now think about it.  </p>

<p>If there was some concern by the employees, it would either be (1) because their test was not performed, or (2) because of concern for something they saw unrelated to the work they were there to perform.</p>

<p>It would be stupid for any employee of SLB to just start talking to the press about any negligence they might have seen on the rig (1) because there&#39;s probably a good chance that it might not have been directly related to their work (2) you would be directly making yourself responsible for &quot;calling out&quot; BP, meaning that you&#39;d have to make sure that your comments are 100% accurate, otherwise your own company would suffer as a result, not to mention by taking a deliberate action like that you&#39;re painting a target on your own company.  </p>

<p>Do you think BP would hire SLB to do any additional work if it came out that one of their employees was blabbing to the press about how sloppy they did their jobs?</p>

<p>So, yes, there isn&#39;t much of a story yet for these reasons, but to say that this is a reason to just look the other way is stupid.  I&#39;m sorry that you can&#39;t wait for the story to develop, but these things take time, and this is just coming to light right now.</p>

<p>So how about we continue to investigate and ask questions until we start getting some meaningful answers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not interested in the original posting, except what can be backed up by other sources. I&#39;m not going to waste my time thinking about what that rumour posting <em>could</em> mean.</p>

<p>CBL: not in the Reuters story. Concern by the employees: not in the Reuters story. </p>

<p>Sure, if the SLB people were concerned it could mean lots of things, but so far there&#39;s no reason to assume they were concerned.</p>

<p>Sounds great to me, so long as you actually investigate and come up with evidence. Making assumptions on the basis of rumour, on the other hand, I&#39;d consider a waste of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work for Schlumberger and can say that, while I do not know any specifics, and probably couldn&#39;t say if I did, the general story goes that there was a crew on the rig hours before the explosion. They were set to do the Cement Bond Log to test the integrity of the cement, but the service was canceled. Had the crew run the CBL, the SLB crew would have been on the rig, doing the job when the rig exploded. The log wouldn&#39;t have been completed before the explosion and there wouldn&#39;t have been any time to interpret the data and say for sure the cement was in poor condition (which is still only a theory). The CBL wouldn&#39;t have made any difference in this case. The way I see it, lives were saved by not having more SLB people near the rig.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha ha, sorry to disappoint just run of the mill procedure meetings with oil companies who are not BP to discuss their problems (like setting a rig on fire and managing to not make it front page news).  From my experience BP is one of the more safety orientated companies to work for.  Other companies that I&#39;ve worked for have let the standards on their rigs slip to scary levels. One major company had a wellhead leaking a fine mist of oil for 6 months before they decided to do anything about it.  Another contacted us about a casing hanger that was so badly corroded it could have just collapsed at any minute.  </p>

<p>UPDATE 1-Schlumberger director leaves board due to BP ties</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO June 7 (Reuters) - Washington D.C. insider Jamie Gorelick has left the board of Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N: Quote) because of her law firm&#39;s representation of BP Plc (BP.L: Quote) in its oil spill response, the company said on Monday.</p>

<p>Gorelick, a former U.S. deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, notified Schlumberger of her resignation on June 3, the world&#39;s largest oilfield services company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Gorelick, a partner at D.C. law firm WilmerHale, cited her firm&#39;s representation of BP in connection with congressional hearings related to April&#39;s Deepwater Horizon accident that led to a blown-out well and oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico. [ID:nN07147206]</p>

<p>Media reports last week said Gorelick would head BP&#39;s legal efforts.</p>

<p>Listed as 59 years old in the latest corporate filing, she had served on Schlumberger&#39;s board since 2002. Gorelick is just the latest lawyer to depart the board, which lost its longest-serving member, Linda Stuntz, in April after 17 years.</p>

<p>Nearly a month after the April 20 fire that preceded the Horizon&#39;s sinking two days later, Schlumberger revealed it had a crew on the rig that departed only hours before the explosion that triggered the disaster. [ID:nN19270822]</p>

<p>Schlumberger&#39;s crew had been performing well measurement services known as wireline. (Reporting by Braden Reddall; editing by Andre Grenon) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work for Schlumberger and can say that, while I do not know any specifics, and probably couldn&#39;t say if I did, the general story goes that there was a crew on the rig hours before the explosion. They were set to do the Cement Bond Log to test the integrity of the cement, but the service was canceled. Had the crew run the CBL, the SLB crew would have been on the rig, doing the job when the rig exploded. The log wouldn&#39;t have been completed before the explosion and there wouldn&#39;t have been any time to interpret the data and say for sure the cement was in poor condition (which is still only a theory). The CBL wouldn&#39;t have made any difference in this case. The way I see it, lives were saved by not having more SLB people near the rig.</p>
