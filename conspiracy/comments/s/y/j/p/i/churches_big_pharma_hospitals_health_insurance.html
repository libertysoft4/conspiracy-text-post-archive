I hate to be negative, but let&#39;s be honest with ourselves; these institutions do not care about you or your well being. They do not care about your quality of life or even if you live or die. They just want to get as much money as possible from you before you do pass on and, if they can, extend your life a little bit longer as to extract as much money as possible from you. </p>

<p>I would love to hear a counter-argument proving this statement incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I may try to throw a wrench into this topic (I love playing the devil&#39;s advocate) </p>

<p>So if you are running a soup kitchen (I use this example because it seems so very innocent in its desire to aid the disenfranchised) and you have two candidates to run the kitchen day to day wouldn&#39;t you pay the qualified candidate double in order to better run your kitchen, have them be more competent, devoted, increase production and effectiveness etc than have someone who is mediocre?</p>

<p>I know companies like World Vision pay their CEOs next to nothing (still about 2 million a year or so) compared to other companies of its size ( think I remember reading the World Vision CEO had made somewhere around 30 million before taking the job) But he has also taken the company and helped it grow as well as being the face of the company and working some crazy hours.</p>

<p>(2 million is still a lot for a CHARITY, which is why I agree with your point but I still think that the institution do good, and care about people, at least a little)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, I dont disagree with you on the Pharma/Insurance thing. Theyre businesses, of course their going to be more interested in the money, that&#39;s the job. My response to the rest though (mainly pertaining to churches, hospitals, and to a much lesser degree, government) is that it&#39;s very hard to represent a group like that as a whole on anything. Maybe (most likely even) you will see greed and corruption at the top echelons, but at the and middle levels, the doctors and the nurses, pastors and the vicars, you find a lot of people who do actually care about others, and do their best to help them. Take a pediatrician for example. They do earn a comfortable living, but they sure arent bagillionaires, and they don&#39;t make as much as people in other specialities do, but they still chose to help kids because that&#39;s where their passion is. Ditto for many pastors in charge of just one church.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Yes, there are some jackasses with power, but the people who actually help you do want to help you</strong></p>

If your only rule is &quot;do anything to make money&quot; then that justifies organized crime and drug cartels, or slavery. So obviously businesses are subject to other rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the crony &quot;businesses&quot; and crony socialist entities (eg the military industrial complex, the Zionist complex, the Fed/bankster complex, the corrupt Medicare complex) in bed with Big Government that are so dangerous, because they use the government to put the (corrupted) &quot;rule of law&quot; behind their thieving, proto-totalitarian rackets. </p>

<p>All central government should be cut back to bare minimum, with states picking up any safety net role.</p>

<p>If Big Business rips people off, it can be criminally prosecuted, and the marketplace will additionally clip its wings (but can&#39;t if it is protected by criminal Big Government).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Komen was run by evil Republicans and the Red Cross has long been a temp agency for out of work Republican officials. They are run by Republicans so greed is their god. </p>

<p>Some churches operate just to rip people off, but some small churches do not. </p>

<p>Universities used to be non-profit before professors were deliberately convinced they were part of the &quot;elite&quot; and should be being paid like they were. And government is never supposed to be a business. And it&#39;s not though it&#39;s exploited by businesses. </p>
