    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. This is fairly sensible logic; I don&#39;t offer evidence of other. You decide for yourself. The argument stands, and if you thing it doesn&#39;t apply, then by all means.</p>

<p>The argument goes like this - 
Humans (or any reasonably and plausible equivalent) should statistically be able to enter space travel in the next century. Let&#39;s say we have 75% that by 2100 we have &#39;extensive&#39; and permanent settlements in the near solar system. Once we do we&#39;ll keep on expanding, <em>even if we had become stuck at 1950s technology</em>.  Space is not a plush environment, but with sufficient material resources we can bootstrap gradual and unimpeded expansion in colonization there. I&#39;d say that in a few centuries human (or its descendant posthumans) would have permanent (and fairly affluent) colonies on or near all planets, on or near all moons, and on probably several hundred asteroids. This would not stop. By 2500, or not much later, we would start making interstellar jumps - not all the way to alpha centauri in one leap, but from KBO to KBO making incremental progress towards any nearby stars. Now let&#39;s assume technology does not progress fast, and we stay mostly an organic species (all very pessimist projections) and we travel really slow. Now with the above progress &quot;slow&quot; means a travel rate of an average light year per 100 years. That means that most nearby stars will come under human descendant colonization efforts, a gradually expanding cloud of very big industrial structures - we are talking cities in space, moonlets covered with sprawling industries, deconstruction efforts and mining of asteroids. This would spread as a tidal wave of change throughout the galaxy.</p>

<p>Now if humans wouldn&#39;t do this, someone else would. You tend to notice the ones that make the most noise, not the subtle or humble. So if one or ten or 90% of all intelligent, tool using species would somehow opt out of &quot;noisome&quot; galactic colonization, others would take their place and still do so. </p>

<p>This would spread all over the galaxy is just a few million years, and not subtly so - you&#39;d really see like a blazing wavefront of industrial activity. Such progress, based on material premises we know about, would be extremely obvious, even thousands of light years away. Industrial interstellar societies would be very noisy, and very messy. </p>

<p>Yet we see nothing. This is at odds with what we can reasonably expect from humanity. Now there may very well be all kinds of hidden surprises and unexpected variables, but we can&#39;t say much about that which we don&#39;t know. So these are the facts and the extrapolations based on current understanding.</p>

<p>If there has been a technologically advanced intelligence in the galaxy in the last few billion years, we should see signs of them, clear and unambiguous signs. Logically there should have been many such civilizations. Yet for some reason we only see emptiness and silence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too believe it has already happen. I don&#39;t have &#39;credible sources&#39; or anything like that, but growing up I stumbled about the whole Extraterrestrial section of the internet and would show my Grandfather the stuff I was reading. He would smile, nod, and walk away. I came upon the &#39;Paper Moon&#39; theory, and reading reports both for and against it, I showed my Grandfather these sites and he got stone faced and said &quot;We went to the Moon, trust me. Go back to reading the other stuff you were showing me, it has more truth than you would think.&quot; I had never seen this man that serious before in my life. He was in the Air Force for 23 years. I have no idea what he did in there, he refuses to talk about it. The most I ever got out of him was when I had enlisted Army a year ago and he told me about Vietnam and how he did E.O.D. until the war was over but &#39;That wasn&#39;t all I did.&#39;</p>

<p>Just my story. Thought I&#39;d share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just thought I&#39;d bring this up: how come nobody ever talks about the possibility of US being the ones to make first contact with a less intelligent species? I imagine a planet being discovered with no intelligence but teeming with all sorts of animal like creatures. Or possibly a race as intelligent as humans but lacking thumbs or hands to build things with, so it&#39;s just a species that has knowledge of things and stories to tell but no tools or technology. /rant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this... there are two possibilities if we were to find life on another planet... it would either be less sophisticated (think anything from chimpanzees to bacteria, although this is just an example and anything found on another planet would likely not come close to either) or more complicated (think anything from humans to beings that have evolved past physical form).  </p>

<p>What do you suppose we would do with less evolved species?  My guess is that we would treat them similarly to how we treat less evolved species on this planet... either by imprisoning (through either natural - tigers that leave the jungle and come into the city get shot or artificial means - go into zoos) or outright exterminating them (think antibiotics).  From this, human nature is revealed.  </p>

<p>Apply this theory in the other direction... with us being the less evolved of the two.  How do you suppose we would be regarded?  Perhaps we are <em>already</em> in the zoo....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well considering the fact that we are comparing these &quot;invaders&quot; to humans...Through human evolution  we see society evolving along side it. The way we treated the Native Americans is by today&#39;s standards unacceptable. Also in recent years we have started to form movements to protect wildlife because our previous society had not taken nature into account while building the foundations for their factories and industry. And while we still have a long way to go with human rights as well as environmental preservation, we are still moving in the right direction. And we are very far off technologically speaking from being able to explore galaxies. </p>

<p>Is it easier to believe that a species advanced enough to create technology we cannot even fathom would act exactly how our ancestors did, or even how we still act today? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>| The way we treated the Native Americans is by today&#39;s standards unacceptable.</p>

<p>People give it lip service, but I don&#39;t really believe for a second that if we, as American policy, wanted something that we wouldn&#39;t take it by force, damn the consequences for others (see: Iraq, etc...)</p>

<p>| in recent years we have started to form movements to protect wildlife because our previous society had not taken nature into account</p>

<p>No, they knew about nature, after all, they had been living in it since people have come to this country, they just didn&#39;t care.  Once again, environmentalism (even basic things like clean air and water) is given lip service and if it comes at additional cost for the bottom line, the people in power are not interested.</p>

<p>| Is it easier to believe that a species advanced enough to create technology we cannot even fathom would act exactly how our ancestors did, or even how we still act today?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just suggesting that while we have a nice coat of paint (or 50) to pass ourselves off as reasonable and fair human beings, the truth is that the base level of survival instincts has not changed much.  In fact, paranoia and mistrust of others (while coming in waves) is at the highest point that I have seen it in my life.</p>
