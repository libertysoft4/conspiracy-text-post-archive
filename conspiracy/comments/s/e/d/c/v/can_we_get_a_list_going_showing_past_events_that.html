<p>One I can think of is the gulf of Tonkein incident. The other is the existence of the Bilderberg group.</p>

<p>What are some other events that were considered false for a period of time, before being declared true?</p>

The suggestion was that a high-end American enterprise, possibly with special forces/Fed connection, have been receiving 1.1-1.5 million 1-kg gold bars from the Fed, hollowing them out, salting them with tungsten, and sending them back to the Fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No proof exists that Jimmy Hoffa was murdered.</p>

<p>Shall we presume that Van Der Lubbe, who was semi-retarded, burned down the entire Reichstag with a pack of matches, and was &quot;found&quot; (like Satam al Suqami&#39;s passport in the WTC rubble on 9/11 by the FBI -- <em>which IS considered by the mainstream to be authentic evidence</em>) behind the burning building (with the matches &amp; a Communist ID card, Holy Scapegoat, Batman!) was simply the unfortunate truth even though it was all too convenient for the newly-appointed Hitler?</p>

<p>Shall we presume the undisputed tunnels from Goering&#39;s residence to the Reichstag were a temptation resisted by the Nazis, even though the Enabling Act was the shining prize that resulted from the fire?</p>

<p>If the Reichstag Fire-as-Nazi-calling-card does not belong in the &quot;historical facts&quot; record, then it certainly belongs in the &quot;highly suspicious&quot; book.  The &quot;No Proof Exists&quot; book is a specious, dangerous debunking point that is all-too-easy &amp; disregards extraordinary historical circumstantial evidence, that can be abused regarding everything from Jimmy Hoffa to the Missing Link ... and <em>no proof exists</em> that Van Der Lubbe was the culprit or sole culprit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the Liberty first came under attack, planes were immediately sent out from a US carrier ... not to defend Liberty, but to attack Egypt. They were called back when it became clear that the attackers were Israeli, not Egyptian. I ran across this information when reading a detailed account of the events surrounding the attack on Liberty.</p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ve found <a href="http://www.uss-liberty.com/2010/10/03/the-1967-israeli-attack-on-the-uss-liberty-false-flag-hatched-by-israeli-and-u-s-intelligence-for-invasion-of-egypt-and-possibly-ww3/">a page</a> that carries the same tidbit of information:</p>

<p><em>The Liberty‘s S.O.S. message was picked up by the U.S. 6th fleet patrolling 400 miles west in the Mediterranean. Nuclear-armed A-4 bombers are launched from the USS America aircraft carrier. A nuclear strike had been ordered against Egypt. The U.S. embassy in Cairo was notified that an attack was coming. A few minutes later, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara from the Pentagon orders the aircraft recalled.</em></p>

<p>My idiot dad doesn&#39;t believe this.  Can you direct me to some proof which sounds MSMesque authoritative?  Or some actual authority?  I found in <a href="http://fair.org">FAIR</a> the report from 2010 from the IAEA in which they mention that in 2005 Israel didn&#39;t participate in the nonproliferation treaty, but I don&#39;t know where to look to find anything more specific than that.  Don&#39;t we know this because of some high profile legal case involving espionage or something?</p>

<p>I think it has to do with the mod censorship that people are starting to notice all over reddit. The mods are pumping this sub-reddit so full of disinformation it distracts from the actual researchers. </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;d like I can provide proof (like actual evidence, primary documents etc) for any number of the conspiracies I&#39;m familiar with. </p>

<p>I put together courses for a UC History professor, who clearly does not think my research is &quot;speculative delusion and/or tired repetition&quot; because she has hired me to put together more courses for her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For full points, we should be able to demonstrate marginalized conspiracists before, and good documentation afterward. For example, Gulf of Tonkin, I&#39;m unaware of where there were claims that it was faked before it slowly came out, but this would add greatly to the historical knowledge.</p>

<p>Upvoted in the hopes we&#39;ll get more good examples here.</p>

<p>Certainly, many things have been revealed slowly over time. But I&#39;m having a hard time thinking of something that nicely fits the pattern &quot;people in the wilderness claim and are denied&quot; followed by &quot;well established fact in the mainstream&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, Bilderberg, was the existence of the meeting itself ever in question? To my limited knowledge, it has seemed that it&#39;s more that there has been a lack of information about their actions, and claims about what those are.</p>

<p>F.D.R. started with gold at a legally fixed value, confiscated massive amounts of gold while compensating people at that price (vis-a-vis eminent domain-backed executive order - &quot;Executive Order #6102&quot;), and then hiked the price of gold up, creating a $2,800,000,000 increase in value.  adjusting upwards at percent of GDP, that&#39;s a modern $750,000,000,000 increase in the value of the gold confiscated.  in other words, he engineered one of the largest thefts in U.S. history.</p>

<p><em>naturally</em>, he has been regarded as a savior of the American public since then.</p>

The same is true with Nazi head shrinking and most of the holocaust propaganda cited above. The &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; was that these claims were overblown propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really wrong. There is supposed to have been an experiment, which took place off the camps, and did not involve Jews, to make soap from human fat. One experiment, one time. It was never done in any other way. So the soap stories are all false. The Nazis were not rendering down Jews for soap.</p>

<p>As for the lampshade story, various articles were made from the skin of dead human beings in Victorian times, as a kind of joke, but I&#39;ve seen no credible report of the Nazis turning Jews into lampshades.</p>
