        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, kinda funny how I stumbled upon this. Started out looking at Nikola Tesla quotes (big fan). And one of them was “If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe.” So I did some research and apparently Marko Rodin is close to figuring out whatever the hell it is. Anyway a guy by the name of Cameron Akers apparently made some videos about Rodins work. He also happened to be a fellow Redditor and also worked for the Military in Afghanistan(read AMA for details). He did an AMA about 10 months ago about his job in the military and about 2 months ago apparently commented suicide. Although all of his friends and family say there were absolute no signs of this. He was apparently very intelligent and making about 200k a year working for the military. Anyway he posted his passport in the AMA and only blacked out his personal info.
Original AMA <a href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/hq278/iama_contractor_for_the_dea_in_afghanistan_and/">http://www.reddit.com/comments/hq278/iama_contractor_for_the_dea_in_afghanistan_and/</a>
Alsot this <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1790206/pg1">http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1790206/pg1</a>
TL:DR Fellow Redditor &quot;committed suicide&quot; months after doing an AMA related to the military involvement with heroin in Afghanistan. Was also doing work with Rodin Coil(free energy)</p>

<p>Wow!  Didn&#39;t really expect this much discussion!  Thanks for all of the great info!  Maybe this will help in some small way.</p>

<p>The guy in the IAmA never positively identifies him self. Unless some one can positively the ID the guy in the IAmA as this Akers guy there is really nothing to see here. The DEA experience is the only reasonable motive I see for him being suicided. I really doubt that he would be suicided for his work with rodin coils.

    <div class="md"><p>This story deserves to be downvoted into oblivion because it all smells like bullshit.</p>

<p>The Original Reddit submission talks about a guy who majored in computer science at Clemson and worked for the DEA in Afghanistan.   According to the GodLIkeProductions link, his name was Cameron Akers.   According to Aker&#39;s obituary, he was just a loser who only had a high school education and worked at a Pharmacy.  See for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d not heard of these Rodin Coils, before, but here&#39;s what I found after a quick investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marko Rodin has studied a series of simple regularities in the decimal number system. From these he derives his &quot;Vortex mathematics&quot;. Vortex mathematics is purported to explain all mathematical operations, the genes, and non-decaying energy. These regularities are inherent to the decimal system because of its base. You can find similar regularities in systems other than the decimal. They are for example applied in binary arithmetic - to make the computer work you&#39;re sitting in front of. </p>

<p>The Rodin Coil consists of a pair of wires wrapped around a doughnut-shaped core in a star pattern. Rodin claims this particular design, deduced from his number theory, yields different electromagnetic properties than any other coil - enabling it to create perpetual energy, and thus breaking fundamental laws of physics. Rodin admits not being able to build those coils himself - as he is &quot;not an electrical engineer&quot; (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVrrtigKcpE&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVrrtigKcpE&amp;amp;feature=related</a> at 3:00). In absence of any scientific proof, it remains therefore highly questionable, to say the least, whether the Rodin coil has any special physical properties. </p>

<p>According to Rodin, the coil represents the underpinning geometry of the universe, which draws its non-decaying energy from the vortex, the zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I don&#39;t see anything there to get excited about. The heroin aspect sounds like more of a reason for any dubious behaviour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is going to be hard reading. I have been researching Tesla&#39;s &quot;3 6 9&quot; and can assure you that it is referring to a &quot;clock&quot; like structure, similar to that of the planets orbit rotation.
Where 3 is the East quadrature, 6 is the South Quadrature, and 9 is the West Quadrature. This directly relates to the work of Wilhelm Reich (orgone energy is dielectrical in nature and massless) and particularly Edward Leedskalnin&#39;s work with magnetic current and what Leedskalnin described as perpetual motion.
Having thoroughly researched the topic in multiple avenues, including those of Eric Dollard, the researches of Borderland Sciences Foundation over the last 40 years, and the sum total work of Steinmetz&#39; and Maxwell&#39;s non second order derivative quarternions I have actually revealed that the ocean receives about 9billion trillion watts of energy from the moon per second. This is obviously a very large amount of energy, and thus, money.
I am currently being monitored by DARPA.MIL, NRO.MIL and Department of Defence. They are reading all of my articles on the Nazi Parametric transformers, the origins of electricity in 1890, Steinmetz work at General Electric producing unlimited amounts of electricity from the SQUARE root of -1, and the interesting correlation between wireless power of Nikola Tesla , World War I, and the correlation between unlimited energy systems and the free production of gold from electrolysis, to the implosion and destruction on a monetary system which is literally held up from the base by.
This technology, in terms of the 3 6 9, Tesla&#39;s wireless energy achievements, and Dollars replications (which by the way were destroyed by a swat team) is long forgotten and totally suppressed.
Right now there is a facility in Bolinas California that used to generate longitudinal wave speeds of 291,000mi/sec and transverse wave speeds of 186,000mi/sec, it still exists today. A group called commonweal and Point Reyes does appear to be doing all they can do destroy it. Remember, this facility housed one of the only perfectly working Alexanderson Generators ever to be build (alexanderson was a protege of steinmetz). It was in 1914, and is still today, THE MOST ADVANCED electrical installation on the planet because of the aforementioned facts.
The military were absolutely terrified of such an advanced electrical installation, or circuit topology falling into the hands of the enemy, so in 1914, just as WW1 was about to start. Marconi, the owner of the building and the company Marconi Wireless was removed from the building and the entire thing went under government military control under the company name &quot;RCA&quot; - Radio Corporation America.
Post 1914, Radio Corporation America, under a military general rule removed the MULTIPLE LOADED FLAT TOP ANTENNAE from the history of electrical theory, and replaced it with the rhombic atennae, also known as the &quot;D-TYPE&quot;, it was an inferior technology that exhibited transverse propogations of only 186,000mi/sec, or rather, the longitudinal waveforms which exhibited much more powerful amplitudes were removed from the coroporate industrial machine, in order to better assure an electrical and military superiority over it&#39;s people and potentially the rest of the world.
What a terrifying prospect. It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t believe this, I can assure you i&#39;m well researched and it is all true. ALL OF IT.
You can contact me for further evidence or proofs if you require it. You can do this at adam at conspiracy dot co.
and.... I have sort of worked for the military too ;-) hehe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake. Here is a correction.</p>

<p>In an obituary Vladimir Karapetoff, professor of electrical engineering at Cornell University, characterized Steinmetz&#39;s thirty-year career at GE with the remark that he was &quot;allowed by his employers to try to generate electricity from the square root of minus one.&quot;</p>

<p>References? R. Kline&#39;s Steinmetz: Engineer &amp; Socialist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kline seems to have misinterpreted the work. The references to i are really references to rotation of phases and sine waves represented in the complex plane, but that&#39;s really just a mathematically easy way to treat sine waves. What this was all about was rotating electrical machinery: generators. When you deal with sine wave power generators, one can use i in the equations but the reality doesn&#39;t actually involve power from nothing.  People in general don&#39;t quite understand it and misinterpret it as Kline did.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think Kline misinterpreted, the quote I gave is factual in it&#39;s origin, as was the claim that GE allowed C. P . Steinmetz to try to generate electricity from the square root of -1. The square root of -1 , also being i, the imaginary component.</p>

If you had even one ioata of good mindedness you would not have dismissed as &quot;badly formatted&quot; the most complete description of the suppression of Tesla&#39;s, Leedskalnin&#39;s , Reich&#39;s and TT Browns Magneto Dielectricity.
You can continue la la la ing, until it is formatted correctly, whilst the rest of us Engineers, Scientists, philosophers and mathematicians, work it out, and do it; then in 30 years time when you are still employing the &quot;let it burn&quot; formatting policy, you&#39;ll be able to see for yourself the ignorance that comes with such pursuits, good luck with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I shared this quite technical and detailed information and historical perspective freely, and at the expense of years of my time, and quite detailed research, what you got was a recounting as best I know it to start with. It is based on my readings from Books like Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist by R. Kline , Wireless Power by Eric Dollard, Primary &amp; Secondary Coils by Eric Dollard, Magnetic Current by Edward Leedskalnin &amp; My Inventions by Nikola Tesla, not to mention thousands of articles and patents on the subject, having written some 100 + articles on the subject myself, I have indeed invested a great deal of time and effort into understanding and discussing this topic at length.</p>

<p>It is extremely saddening to me that such exhaustive research, and the non reluctance of confirmable technical facts might be met by the paragraph police.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think how my opinion of verifiable facts that you can check could be seen as vitriol or spiteful, or my remarks that it is more often than not that the paragraph police fail to understand or even pay attention to the facts, or do the research. (So they basically had nothing useful to say other than to make it easier to read). I have done the research and I am in possession of the facts, I have given them to reddit boards/this thread as best as I knew them, which you are able to check quite easily, given the extreme detail. I recommend that you do that yourself if you have an interest in the truth, as I have spent years at this.</p>

<p>The facts remain, that faster than light waves existed and were put to use at the Marconi Wireless installation in Bolinas. Longitudinal dielectric waves exhibiting velocities of 291,000mi/sec, and transverse wave form propogations similary of 186,000mi/sec, the facts are the evidence of Tesla technology, and the remains of the site that generated these longitudinal waves still exist, in the technical designs of the Alexanderson generator, and the original Maxwell equations which were not limited to 2nd order derivatives. Of course there is also the site which still exists today I spoke about in Bolinas, where all of this was happening and where aerials and transmissions lines and pole arrangements are clearly visible and can be seen by yourself today, they have been visited by the likes of Dollard and Borderland Sciences.</p>

<p>I do believe I established that the Bolinas site represents the most Advanced Electrical Installation ever to exist, and that the evidence on the site still remains in part, and I do believe I also established that there was a conspiracy to allow the site to fall into dis-repair. The Loss of such a site would be great to humanity.</p>

<p>You see, the reasons why I think the paragraph police are a disservice to humanity, is because they would gladly debate the arrangement of my words, rather than merely checking the disturbing truth of the suppression of electrical theory, as far back as 1914.</p>

<p>I invite you and any other honest person to check if my claims are true , in actual fact I have now given you the precise sources to much of my facts, Eric Dollard being the main proponent, was a genius as a child, and was invited on a special American programme for gifted children to work at R.C.A for many years. </p>

<p>That is why Dollard had many of the RCA parts , and that is why a Swat team bulldozed, and destroyed them. Confused? Well RCA inherited all the old Marconi Wireless stuff, including the Alexanderson Generator, and the Multiple Loaded Flat Top Antennae transmission equipment.</p>

<p>I guess the fact I&#39;m pointing out is that the government failed to entirely rid themselves of all of the faster than light 291,000mi/sec longitudinal wave technology that Tesla was working on initially, which was sort of used (or stolen) by Marconi Wireless CO., which as previously established was taken over by the government and the military via the RCA entity, and then some of it was inherited by Eric Dollard.</p>

<p>Now, that is why a SWAT team came for Eric Dollard. Ask Eric Dollard about Commonweal and he&#39;ll just tell you to talk to &quot;Hillary&quot;.</p>

<p>You want to know why people end up dead? You don&#39;t have to look far. If only you&#39;d bother to check the multitude of historic, engineering and electrical facts I&#39;m conveying simultaneously to you, instead of criticising my personality or my paragraphs.</p>

<p><em>shrug</em>. So you see, when I said Best, I really did mean it. I wanted to give it my best and that is what you&#39;ve got from me today.</p>

<p>Best,
A</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is going to be hard reading. I have been researching <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1609244/pg1">Tesla&#39;s &quot;3 6 9&quot;</a> and can assure you that it is referring to a &quot;clock&quot; like structure, similar to that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_%28astronomy%29">planets orbit rotation</a>, where 3 is the East quadrature, 6 is the South Quadrature, and 9 is the West Quadrature.  </p>

<p>This directly relates to the work of <a href="http://www.orgonelab.org/wrhistory.htm">Wilhelm Reich</a> (orgone energy is <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dielectric">dielectrical</a> in nature and massless) and particularly <a href="http://www.leedskalnin.com/">Edward Leedskalnin</a>&#39;s work with magnetic current and what Leedskalnin <a href="http://www.leedskalnin.com/LeedskalninsPerpetualMotionHolder.html">described</a> as perpetual motion.  </p>

<p>Having thoroughly researched the topic in multiple avenues, including those of <a href="http://peswiki.com/index.php/PowerPedia:Eric_Dollard">Eric Dollard</a>, the researches of <a href="http://www.borderlands.com/">Borderland Sciences Foundation</a> over the last 40 years, and the sum total work of <a href="http://research.borderlands.com/wiki/Charles_Steinmetz">Steinmetz</a>&#39; and <a href="http://peswiki.com/index.php/Site:LRP:James_Clerk_Maxwell">Maxwell</a>&#39;s non second order derivative quarternions, I have actually revealed that the ocean receives about 9 billion trillion watts of energy from the moon per second.  [<a href="http://www.lngkny.com/english/allinone.asp?title=%BA%A3%D1%F3%C4%DC">ref</a>]</p>

<p>This is obviously a very large amount of energy, and thus, money. I am currently being monitored by DARPA.MIL, NRO.MIL and Department of Defence. They are reading all of my articles on:  </p>

<ul>
<li>the Nazi Parametric transformers<br/></li>
<li>the origins of electricity in 1890<br/></li>
<li>Steinmetz work at General Electric producing unlimited amounts of electricity from the SQUARE root of -1<br/></li>
<li>the interesting correlation between wireless power of Nikola Tesla , World War I, and the correlation between unlimited energy systems and the free production of gold from electrolysis, to the implosion and destruction on a monetary system which is literally held up from the base by.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>This technology, in terms of the 3 6 9, Tesla&#39;s wireless energy achievements, and Dollard&#39;s replications (which by the way were destroyed by a swat team) is long forgotten and totally suppressed. Right now there is a facility in Bolinas California that used to generate longitudinal wave speeds of 291,000mi/sec and transverse wave speeds of 186,000mi/sec, it still exists today.  </p>

<p>A group called <a href="http://www.commonweal.org/retreat/">Commonweal</a> and Point Reyes does appear to be doing all they can do destroy it.<br/>
 Remember, this facility housed one of the only perfectly working <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderson_alternator">Alexanderson Generators</a> ever to be built (Alexanderson was a protege of Steinmetz). It was in 1914, and is still today, THE MOST ADVANCED electrical installation on the planet because of the aforementioned facts.  </p>

<p>The military were absolutely terrified of such an advanced electrical installation, or circuit topology falling into the hands of the enemy, so in 1914, just as WW1 was about to start, Marconi, the owner of the building and the company Marconi Wireless was removed from the building and the entire thing went under government military control under the company name &quot;RCA&quot; - Radio Corporation America.  </p>

<p>Post 1914, Radio Corporation America, under a military general rule removed the MULTIPLE LOADED FLAT TOP ANTENNAE from the history of electrical theory, and replaced it with the rhombic atennae, also known as the &quot;D-TYPE&quot;, it was an inferior technology that exhibited transverse propagations of only 186,000mi/sec, or rather, the longitudinal waveforms which exhibited much more powerful amplitudes were removed from the corporate industrial machine, in order to better assure an electrical and military superiority over it&#39;s people and potentially the rest of the world.  </p>

<p>What a terrifying prospect. It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t believe this, I can assure you I&#39;m well researched and it is all true. ALL OF IT. You can contact me for further evidence or proofs if you require it. You can do this at adam at conspiracy dot co. and.... I have sort of worked for the military too ;-) hehe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi kris_lace, thanks, this is a very good summary of the researches I have done into Tesla&#39;s 3 6 9 and the Energy Suppression of &quot;Faster than light&quot;.</p>

<p>I must say I really appreciate you taking the time to do that,</p>

<p>Remember there is so much more about Tesla, and Bolinas that it is hard to summarise it all when asked. When tesla was asked to give the velocity of his waves (all waves have energy) he gave it velocity as pi /2 * C. This means that C is not the limiting factor, and is a constant ratio SQUARE between Energy and MASS. This should not be a surprising statement, at least in Tesla-land, because Dr. Tesla believed and claimed scientifically he had detected rays of up to 50 times the speed of light. This may have been possibly done by electromechanical means, as there is no way to see waves that travel faster than 186,000mi/sec. (There is no way to see faster than transverse waves with our eyes, that I know of) </p>

<p>e.g. an electromechanical apparatus which could detect faster than light inductions could potentially. This speculation is of course unsupportable by scientific or historic fact, however pi / 2 <em>C as Tesla gave it and his claim of 50</em>C cosmic rays remain historically verifiable.</p>

<p>As for the rest, I don&#39;t expect it to be as readily submittable to fact as my previous posts. However, Tesla did claim to have found a way to stop all transverse (186,000mi/sec) light from existing within a given space. This is akin to removing the light from lightbulbs, matches, any source of light, the means by which Tesla would have achieved this is a great mystery, if at all. </p>

<p>Interestingly, given pi / 2 * C, Tesla claimed he had &quot;conceived a means to convey large amounts of power absolutely regardless of distance&quot;. This of course is a step  beyond a longitudinal or vertical wave speed of 291,000mi/sec, exactly 105,000mi/sec faster than light, but actually a step towards some sort of strange instant gravitational means of transmitting energy.</p>

<p>Hit a hammer on a piece of metal you will see that there is a spark, that mechanical energy from the hammer, created electrical energy in the spark, or what Edward Leedskalnin called the individual magnets, or magnetic current.</p>

<p>Now we know enough to say that mechanical energy is connected to electrical energy, because a motor can convert electrical to mechanical, and a dynamo (or the same motor in reverse) can convert mechanical rotation to electrical transmission. We can ask what creates mechanical energy in the first place? With a flywheel, a person must stand on the ground to push off it , to generate that electricity, So the mechanical energy of the person moving the flywheel needed the gravity to hold against the wheel, to turn it, otherwise the wheel would turn one way and the person cranking the flywheel shaft the opposite direction. This is akin to an ice skating rink and two people pushing off eachother. In that Newtonian forces are involved. (f1 and f2). That is, the active component electrically, or mechanically always has a reactive component electrically or mechanically that is always equal and opposed in force. </p>

<p>So we could say that the weight of the generator and the mass of the cables effects the total energy output, when converting mechanical force into electrical force. We could also say that the velocity and the distance of the forces affects the total energy output when creating the mechanical force. Without a centre of gravity to push from then there would be no mechanically derived power to generate the electricity.</p>

<p>And this is why the moon makes the ocean move around like it does. Like the transmission lines that exhibit millions of volts of cosmic voltage induction (or free energy), the ocean is too a vast dielectric conductor, of great length, and radius, and thus, each individual part of that substance is under a different amount of force at any moment, but , entirely connected.</p>

<p>You will not hear anything like this anywhere else.</p>

<p>It will all be in my book. Thank you, again,</p>

<p>Best,
A</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wont mess you around, because you asked a very specific question about Leedskalnin.</p>

<p>Edward Leedskalnin was a clever man that studied magnetic current well, he knew that it was the pyramid builders secret, and he wrote about it, claiming he knew the secrets of the pyramid builders, the laws of weight, and currents.</p>

<p>Leedskalnin throughout his book  magnetic current teaches how to divide and split magnetic currents. On the front of his book he includes two &quot;S&quot; like shape symbols, these represent the two currents from a battery, </p>

<p>Go to the pennsylvania grand masonic lodge and head to the Norman Room, then you will see how Edward Leedskalnin divided those S currents using chains, and dividing the magnetic field, look at the ceiling, you will see all of the different ways to divide magnetic current.</p>

<p>You will be impressed.</p>

<p>Thank you for asking, a great thing that you were interested in it ;)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know a great deal about Freemasonry , however, considering the aforementioned facts, and how the tradition of Freemasonry preserves above all things the teachings of King Solomon, which I believe originate from early Egypt, and the early Egyptian heritage originating from the Pyramid builders, these masonic drawings showing the &quot;Leedskalnin &quot; divided magnetic currents, should make more than a compelling discovery for those that have read Edward Leedskalnins book Magnetic Current. I certainly can say it did for me!</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Ed left half of the pages blank supposedly to encourage the reader to take notes, but the rumor is it&#39;s actually for the reader to solve some sort of hidden message in the bizarre little book. As far as I know, no one has come up with any solution.</p>

<p>As for the Pennsylvania lodge, I find it interesting that someone with your...expertise...is aware of that and is citing it as an example of &quot;secrets in plain sight&quot; when it comes to this sort of exotic energy manipulation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gb0Bi8eqAA">I watched this documentary a few years back</a> where the connection is made between Leedskalnin&#39;s work and the art in the Pennsylvania lodge. Although I can&#39;t claim to understand all of it, my intuition has always told me that this stuff is extremely important, so thanks for putting it all in this broader context.</p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;ll be sure to add Magnetic Current into my burgeoning library of weird stuff ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because while you and the paragraph police were busy criticising my language,  I was busy providing the Techanical and historic Details about R.C.A and faster than light waves.</p>

<p>Your comments discrediting myself and Reich, they lack substance and understanding. Orgone though, is a substance itself, a dielectric, massless substance theorised by Wilhelm Reich in his theory of Cosmic Superimposition. The Massless component is actually a requirement, or a portion to the proper working of a 3-COIL Tesla Magnifying Transmitter system, the massless component is a part of the LMD (Longitudinal Magneto Dielectric) component and is probably critical to understanding faster than light transmission systems. The Tesla Magnifying Transmitter for instance recirculates an oscillating current at a given frequency, but at each pulse or &quot;hertz&quot; only 60% of the impulse is leaked, and 40% of the impulse is passed onto the next cycle. This causes an indefinite increase in voltage in the coil, by causing the capacitor to asymptotically increase it&#39;s discharges per cycle of a given voltage, until the load matches the MAGNIFICATION per cycle reflection ( e.g. 40% gain from previous cycle reflection + power supply cycle). The device operates based on REFLECTION and something called REVERSE RESISTANCE, which is of concern to the SQUAR ROOT OF -1 specifically, because it is as expressed as &quot;i&quot; , or the sqrt (-1) in Tesla&#39;s patent diagrams!.. I believe this is essentially a description of the Multiple Loaded Flat Top Antennae anyway.... so..Moving on..</p>

<p>It is fair to remark that I made a mistake about the unlimited amounts of electricity from the square root of -1:</p>

<p>Here is the correction and reference.
In an obituary Vladimir Karapetoff, professor of electrical engineering at Cornell University, characterized Steinmetz&#39;s thirty-year career at GE with the remark that he was &quot;allowed by his employers to try to generate electricity from the square root of minus one.&quot;
References? R. Kline&#39;s Steinmetz: Engineer &amp; Socialist
It is worth noting that the square root of -1 is &quot;i&quot; or the &quot;imaginary&quot; component,</p>

<p>To answer your question about what sort of equipment could measure faster than light, Tesla was working with sensitive seismic equipment, mainly because he invented the technology, in any case, it was capable of detecting mechanical fluctuations inside the earths crust.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about that is, the earths crust mechanical fluctuations that he could detect were reactive to instant gravitc effects from the other planets.</p>

<p>oh well, your the expert.</p>

<p>You can continue Facepalming now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Tesla Magnifying Transmitter is supposed to exhibit a secondary coil reflection into the primary between each pulse (or cycle hz from the power supply unit), this travels back from the mutual conductance of the secondary coil into the primary as a &#39;reflection&#39; thereby imparting 40% of the electrical energy into the capacitor , thereby in the next cycle the capacitor will be partially full, from the previous cycle. This is what Steinmetz described as a &#39;cumulative&#39; generation, whereby the leakage per second was less than the total power provided - load per second.</p>

<p>In the diagrams of Dollard the reverse resistance coming from the reflection of the mutual inductance of the secondary coil reflection into the primary, is refered to as i. </p>

<p>the imaginary unit, i allows real numbers to be extended to the complex number system employed by STEINMETZ, Tesla, Dollard, Reich and HEAVISIDE. </p>

<p>I believe in mathematics that i<sup>2</sup> (i squared) being equal to -1. Because i squared is equal to -1 we know that the square root of -1 is equal to i, and this is what is meant by &quot;generating electricity from the square root of -1&quot;, precisely.</p>

<p>The term &quot;imaginary&quot; is used because there is no real number having a negative square. The point of the complex number system is that it involves non real numbers, virtual numbers, if you will. Tesla employed something called the virtual ground. What do you think he meant by that? The Alexanderson Generator employs a similar system, if not identical system to that employed by Tesla.</p>

<p>I believe that the reverse resistance is labeled as &quot;-i&quot; in Dollards diagrams pointing in reverse direction (from secondary coil to primary), denoting that between cycles a complex number (voltage recirculation reflection) is introduced into the circuit to charge a capacitor in between impulse cycles. </p>

<p>IF you will one impulse counts for 100% - 60% Leakage and 40% extra onto the next cycle, and the means Dollard/Tesla label is the -i component as reverse resistance through mutual induction from secondary back to primary, and actually, hence Tesla Magnifying Transmitter, I just told you how it magnifies in kind, you can find out yourself how it works in strength,</p>

<p>I think Tesla was using the 1/4 as opposed the 1/2 wave to do it, in regard to the question about voltage multipliers, the concept is similar, except I am not sure if they use reverse resistance like the Tesla coil do they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m by no means the worlds greatest mathematician, quite the contrary, but in any case, without sounding dullish, I believe I answered this in The reference I gave from Kline, Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist: Professor Vladimir Karapetoff&#39;s comments in Steinmetz obituary, claiming that Steinmetz was &quot;allowed by his employers [GE] to try to generate electriciy from the square root of minus one&quot;. I am curious (and sincerely invite you to comment) on what you think Vladimir might have meant, and if true as fact, what Steinmetz might have been attempting to achieve. I wonder.</p>

<p>Whilst I understand what you meant about i being current and not complex, perhaps Vladimir above was refering to square rooting a running current. I always imagined that he was refering to the complex number i, or a denomination  of phi or pi on the square, given the complex number mathematics that Heaviside and Dollard worked on for both transmission lines and likely operating Tesla coils referring to this &quot;ratio&quot; being proportional to the mass of the coil&#39;s and several other factors I&#39;m actually currently unsure about, and Edward Leedskalnins work with &quot;squaring the circle&quot;, I am in a similar standpoint to you in this regard, I need to do more research before asserting such a relationship, at least before calling that as fact,</p>

I remember <em>years ago</em> ATS was a place where thought provoking discussions happened. And there were (or is it my failling memory) filled with intelligent and <em>good-hearted</em> people.</p>

<p>Then some crackpots pots came, with outlandish stories only backed by feel-good intuitions or gibberish pseudo-science. Then Hate and Mind-blindness came. It was very evident.</p>

<p>Although some discussions still came with real work of investigation or thinking, it becomes less and less.</p>

<p>** last edit: I still have faith in reddit moderation system (don&#39;t care about my own downvoting). There was seriously lacking a way to downvote on ATS the worst stories.
And I find conspiracyads posts quite entairtaining, although he even says he has a book, so it&#39;s really a <em>conspiracy advertising</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I followed this about 1/2 years ago..</strong></p>

<p>I know nothing of this military business, but Marko Rodin basically found out that just the geographical set up of wires and how they&#39;re laced around a shape would increase the efficiency of a type of process. </p>

<p>He was a great character and there&#39;s a youtube series of his where he does a ELI5 lecture on his findings. Also there&#39;s a youtube series of another guy who took up the research (who I think may be this guy, I cant tell until I see a picture.. )who&#39;s commited suicide. Marko took his technological understanding of the coil and applied it to everything he knew, a type of mathematical/philosophical interface he used to interact with reality. I too have veered in this direction and I feel out of everything this is the highest point of interest.. but I digress. So he goes into fantastic detail in explaining his coil and uses school level maths graphs which you (I did) can practice yourself. He found that numbers in a pattern (the vortex geometry) where the tip of efficiency. He noted using mathematical tricks how you could throw calculations at it and find patterns and answers. (kind of in the same way as highlighting all multiples of 5 in a 1-100 number grid and seeing a pattern). He saw potential to exploit this math/philosophical geometry to help out coils and other mechanical implications. </p>

<p>Anyway this other guy I ended up following (who might be the suicide guy) took it up. He believed in God, he was young, and he took rodins mathematical stuff and <strong>improved</strong> on it. He saw other patterns for calculations that marko overlooked. He tried to modernise the research and utilise the implications of the discovery. He seemed like a very intelligent guy and was seeking the help of a computer volunteer to start modelling this technology digitally. He spoke of this generic processor and coined it &#39;vortex based mathematics&#39; and he seemed to agree with a lot of Marko&#39;s spiritual links, but it was noticeable he suppressed it and focused on the maths. I just want to re-iterate one point, he seemed very confident in his ability to understand this concept. It was clear his mind was 100% in this and he allowed romantic notions of this being a huge big thing for science.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. I see what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>DEA != military; if the OP were edited to say &quot;.. making about 200K a year working as a contractor for the DEA&quot; then that sounds pretty plausible. </p>

<p>The AMA says the $200K/yr was AFTER tax; so that&#39;s probably more like $300K before tax, including the foreign earned income exclusion. </p>

<p>If the OP means to say that DEA is effectively the same as the military, I think it&#39;d make more sense to just say that directly - the linked AMA does <em>not</em> seem to argue they&#39;re the same at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you elaborate more on Leedskalnin, I&#39;ve been fascinated with him for years. Where do you think he got his information? Surely he didn&#39;t come up with it all himself.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard allegations that he was a Freemason in his home country of Latvia, but again, surely that&#39;s not where he learned what he did? (and sorry for calling you surely)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks A, you&#39;ve not spoon-fed me a ELI5 comment, you&#39;ve given the real deal. I don&#39;t understand much of what you said, but you&#39;ve <em>inspired me</em> and I will like to look into it more. Thanks for the effort time you&#39;ve put into these replies to us all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m by no means the worlds greatest mathematician, quite the contrary, but in any case, without sounding dullish, I believe I answered this in The reference I gave from Kline, Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist: Professor Vladimir Karapetoff&#39;s comments in Steinmetz obituary, claiming that Steinmetz was &quot;allowed by his employers [GE] to try to generate electriciy from the square root of minus one&quot;. I am curious (and sincerely invite you to comment) on what you think Vladimir might have meant, and if true as fact, what Steinmetz might have been attempting to achieve. I wonder.</p>

<p>Whilst I understand what you meant about i being current and not complex, perhaps Vladimir above was refering to square rooting a running current. I always imagined that he was refering to the complex number i, or a denomination  of phi or pi on the square, given the complex number mathematics that Heaviside and Dollard worked on for both transmission lines and likely operating Tesla coils referring to this &quot;ratio&quot; being proportional to the mass of the coil&#39;s and several other factors I&#39;m actually currently unsure about, and Edward Leedskalnins work with &quot;squaring the circle&quot;, I am in a similar standpoint to you in this regard, I need to do more research before asserting such a relationship, at least before calling that as fact,</p>

<p>Best,
A</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. The OP is not en electrical engineer nor a mathematician but a perhaps intelligent general reader. If he&#39;d had any schooling in real EE, he&#39;d know his statements are (sometimes mis-) interpretations of the opinions of others, and hence divorced from primary truth. As someone earlier stated &quot;Schizo&quot; and I concur. Schizophrenics can be very motivated and have some imperfect reading knowledge. All of frostek&#39;s comments above too are relevant.</p>
