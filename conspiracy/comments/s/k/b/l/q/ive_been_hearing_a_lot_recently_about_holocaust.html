    <div class="md"><p>Holocaust denial is a very deliberately loaded term. It is also used to both mock and shame people IMO. I cannot understand why investigation of this important and interesting part of WW II has been made so taboo and against the law in many countries. </p>

<p>I believed the official narrative that I was taught for 40+ years. My experience of how I have changed is much like what Ryan Dawson describes in this video. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebjHu8h5GmM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebjHu8h5GmM</a></p>

<p>I also believe Article 19 of UN Declaration of Human Rights. </p>

<p>• Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To deny that there were Jews killed during Nazi Germany is just ridiculous. There are tons of photographs showing corpses.</p>

<p>That being said though, I do question the 6 million deaths figure. If you look at census data for that period, there are only about 6 million Jews (or less) living in Eastern Europe during that time period. Obviously, not all of them were killed. They sure had enough of a population left to colonize the Palestinian held territories. The number of Jewish deaths is most certainly a fabrication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree here. I&#39;m not a holocaust denier. I just think the event was bloated to generate sympathy for them. I&#39;m sure there were gas chambers and I&#39;m sure that many of them suffered horribly and that was a tragedy. But regardless of what happened, the actions that they took next against a people that did them no harm nullified any sort of sympathy I would have had for them.</p>

<p>Sonderkommando Auschwitz <a href="http://www.hagalil.com/shoah/holocaust/greif-0.htm">http://www.hagalil.com/shoah/holocaust/greif-0.htm</a></p>

<p><em>Sonderkommandos were divided into several groups, each with a specific specialized function. Some greeted the new arrivals, telling them that they going to be disinfected and showered prior to being sent to labor teams. They were obliged to lie, telling the soon-to-be-murdered prisoners that after the delousing process they would be assigned to labor teams and reunited with their families. These were the only Sonderkommandos to have contact with the victims while they were still alive. Other teams processed the corpses after the gas chambers, extracting gold teeth, and removing clothes and valuables before taking them to the crematoria for final disposal.</em></p>

<p>Sonderkommando <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderkommando">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderkommando</a></p>

<p><em>Sonderkommandos were work units of Nazi death camp prisoners, composed almost entirely of Jews, who were forced, on threat of their own deaths, to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims during The Holocaust.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/sonderkommando.htm">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/sonderkommando.htm</a> </p>

<p><em>The jobs of the Sonderkommado were simple - to clear out the gas chambers once those inside had been murdered. They then had to dispose of the bodies - usually supervised by just a handful of SS guards or guards from the Ukraine who worked for the SS. The Sonderkommando had to remove gold teeth from the victims, work in the crematoriums, burn the bodies - basically anything the SS told them to do.</em></p>

<p>We are not holocaust deniers, but revsionists. No one can disprove the existence of concentration camps or the fact that jews were deported there. Where we tend to disagree in is the gas chamber and final solution. Watch this and look into David Cole and Ernst Zundel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To address a few points people have had:</p>

<p>Concerning the number of Jewish dead: While the exact number is certainly suspect, I think it can be said with reasonable certainty that several million Jews were killed during the Holocaust. That would still place it as one of the deadliest genocides in history. Is there any evidence besides just hearsay of the number of Jews in Europe at the time being less than 6 million?</p>

<p>Concerning Holocaust Denial: I&#39;m on the fence about making denial illegal. While I support freedom of speech, no matter how questionable, in the aftermath of WWII, it was important to force people to face the Holocaust. Entire communities near the concentration camps denied knowledge of their existence, despite being within only a few kilometers of them. Or they ignored the railroad cars filled with prisoners which passed through. Creating legal repercussions for willful ignorance was a reasonable decision, at the time. Whether it is still useful today, I cannot say with any certainty. It must be noted, the laws do not specifically punish questioning of the specific details/figures from the Holocaust, but rather targets persons who willfully and without actual evidence, deny the Holocaust was propagated as a government-sponsored extermination program. </p>

<p>In response to Bumbling&#39;s post about the UN Declaration of Human Rights:
You are invoking a law about human rights to support denial of evidence showing violation of millions of other persons basic rights and right to live.
I can&#39;t say I agree. I would agree the anti-denial laws are out-dated and should either be revised or removed. However, this is to foster SERIOUS discussion, with real evidence, not to let the Holocaust-equivalent of the 911truth movement to start yelling at the top of its lungs.</p>
