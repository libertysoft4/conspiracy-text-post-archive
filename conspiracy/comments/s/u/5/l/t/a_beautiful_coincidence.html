<p>Now, you can do this yourself and I encourage you to- go to any program / website that lets you check longitude / latitude. Navigate yourself to the great pyramid at Giza and hover over where the tip would be (it&#39;s gonna be offset because the picture is usually taken at an angle)... and you get something like 29.9792~ latitude.</p>

<p>Then look at the speed of light in meters per second... 299,792,458 m/s. The latitude of the Pyramid is equal to one of our most important constants in science on the order of five digits.... now that&#39;s just awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a beautiful thought, but the history seems to point to coincidence.</p>

<p>The Egyptians divided night and day into twelve &quot;hours&quot;, but the durations of these hours varied by season.  Shorter nights in summer were made up of twelve short hours. Longer winter nights, made up of twelve longer hours.  They had no seconds, which appear to have arrived in theory in Babylonia around 300 BC, but no way of measuring time this precisely has been found prior to the 16th Century.</p>

<p>The metre was only defined in the 18th Century.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t it seem unlikely that if they were to code the speed of light into the pyramid they would have done so using units of measure that wouldn&#39;t exist until thousands of years later?</p>

<p>Measure the speed of light in miles per minute instead (11,176,944 by my calculations) and use 11.176944 as your latitude.  Now, use -5.402334 as your longitude, and you find yourself at a spot near Burkina Faso.  I&#39;ve no idea what this thing is, but is it a coincidence that <a href="http://maps.google.ie/maps?q=11.176944,-5.402334&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ll=11.176928,-5.402355&amp;amp;spn=0.01383,0.022724&amp;amp;sll=11.180528,-5.401132&amp;amp;sspn=0.01383,0.022724&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=16">the pointy part at the South</a>  is so close to the speed of light (measured in miles per minute)?  Yes.  It is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if?  </p>

<p>No matter where on earth the builders came from, this coincidence with the speed of light only exists if you express the speed of light in units of measure which either weren&#39;t invented until, or couldn&#39;t be measured until, the second half of the second millennium AD - something like 5,000 years after it was built according to generally accepted history of the Great Pyramid.  If you lean to some of the alternative histories of the pyramids, they were built even earlier, meaning that the speed of light trick would have lain dormant for even more millennia.  Did they really do it just for our era?</p>

<p>And what if the builders came from outside our planet?  The metre is derived from earthly dimensions, and the second is derived from the earth&#39;s rotation.  It seems unlikely that an alien civilisation from elsswhere in the universe would have been using these as their native system.  And if they wanted to adopt an earthly system of measure, again why would they use one that wouldn&#39;t be used on earth for thousands of years?</p>

<p>Edit:  Corrected to &quot;Second Millennium AD&quot;, Dammit!</p>

<p>The metric system is just a way of measuring.  You can measure a given length or distance in metres, feet, or any other standard unit and be just as precise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a lot of numbers there, but I don&#39;t see the case they&#39;re making.  Maybe my maths is a bit rusty, but let me show you where I&#39;m getting stuck. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to make sense of what&#39;s going on here... there are a mix of statements and calculations, but it&#39;s not obvious what the &quot;Ta Da&quot; bit is.  Which is the conclusion that says &quot;They must have used metres&quot;?</p>

<p>The relationships between the sides and the angles would be the same regardless of the unit of measure used, so it can&#39;t be that.</p>

<p>The only thing I can see that looks like a &quot;Ta Da&quot; is the pi piece at the end. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>78.53975004 x 4 = 314.159 = 100Pi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The multiplication is correct.  But the value of pi is rounded.  That&#39;s odd, so many of the calculations go on for lots of decimal places, I wonder why the pi one is rounded off.  It doesn&#39;t make much of a case for precision.  pi to 8 decimals, for example is 3.14159265.  Divide that by 4 and multiply by 100 and you get 78.5398163 a different number.  So the 78odd number is close, but not precise.  But what is that number, where did it come from.  Let&#39;s read back up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>199.4909651 : 2.54 = 78.53975004</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a conversion of some centimetre value into inches.  Whoa! Inches?  Why are we converting to inches all of a sudden.  Wasn&#39;t this supposed to be all about proving the use of the metric system?  Anyway, what&#39;s that 199 figure?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>152.2920451 : 0.76340322 = 199.4909651</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, what are we dividing by what here?  What&#39;s that 152 number.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>√23,192.867 = 152.2920451cm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, so it&#39;s the square root of the &quot;First Base&quot; of the pyramid.  The width at ground level.  So that&#39;s the top part of our division.  What was the piece under the line again?  0.76340322  What&#39;s that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.398299923 : 3.14159 = 0.76340322 days</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok.  So you divide something by (a 5-digit rounded) pi to get that number.  What have we divided?  What&#39;s that 2.398 value?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>365.242 : 152.2920451 = 2.398299923</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another division.  What&#39;s that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Length of the First base of the Great Pyramid = 365.242 sacred cubits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoa (again) Sacred Cubits?  Not so metric again.  What&#39;s below the line?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Difference between two bases = 152.2920451cm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that&#39;s the difference in cm (phew, metric again), between the first and second base widths.  Putting all that together.  Deep breath.</p>

<p>Take the length of the first base <em>in sacred cubits</em>, and divide it by the difference between first base and second base <em>in centimetres</em>.  Divide this result by (5 digit) pi.  Divide the square root of the length of first base <em>in centimetres</em>  by this number, and convert your answer to <em>inches</em>, and divide by 4, and you get (5 digit) pi.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a bit convoluted no?  You have to mix three different sorts of distance measurements (sacred cubits, inches, metric) in there as well to massage your figures to force the answer to work.</p>

<p>Not only that, but pi exists at both sides of the equation.</p>

<p>This makes it a bit like the old &quot;Think of a number, double it, add six, half the result and take away the number you originally thought of.  The number you are left with is three&quot; school of math magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You posted the link.  It wasn&#39;t the original source, by the way.  He refers to red and green lines, but doesn&#39;t have any.  I found another source which had a photo with these red and green lines mapped out on it.</p>

<p>In any case, he just copy/pastes it just like you did.  The page is pretty long, and nowhere outside of that section does he mention metric.  So it was pretty much irrelevant to the case in hand.</p>

<p>Anyway, having worked through the numbers and done the math, I&#39;m satisfied that it&#39;s meaningless.  There is no proof, or even evidence here, that I can see that shows that whoever built the pyramids used the metre to do so.  I&#39;ve shown the analysis that I base my conclusion on.  Can you do the same?  Can you explain why you feel this is the evidence you claim it is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See my post below, they used the &quot;pyramid inch&quot; which is equal to 1.0011 of our inches.</p>

<p>When you use this measurement, a striking amount of whole numbers and important ratios emerge.</p>

<p>schkmenebene has the right idea, but is approaching it a little convolutedly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I make no claim that everything about the Pyramids is coincidence.  There are far too many for me to be comfortable with that belief.  Years ago, <em>The Fingerprints of the Gods</em> blew my mind irreversibly on that count.</p>

<p>However, that doesn&#39;t mean I believe everything either.  The Metre is just an arbitrary standard unit of measure, it is no more precise than any other standard unit like say &quot;the foot&quot;, or the &quot;sacred cubit&quot;.  The only reason I don&#39;t list the &quot;pyramid inch&quot; here is because they are fractions of the &quot;sacred cubit&quot;, or it is a multiple of them, if you prefer.</p>

<p>To argue that it would have been impossible to build the pyramids without the metre is just unsupportable.  When apparent mathematical evidence was prevented to show that the metre was used, I had to dive in.  And I&#39;m glad I did.  Pi multiplied and divided by a bunch of numbers being equal to 100 times pi just means that the bunch of numbers multiplied and divided equals 100.  And when you have to resort to using some numbers in centimetres, some in inches and some in sacred cubits to come up with that 100, then it&#39;s pretty obvious to me that you&#39;ve got no proof of anything other than that you can do some basic math, and have the time to select the numbers you need.</p>

<p>All of which keeps me happy with what I originally came to say that the latitude of the Great Pyramid being equal to the speed of light in the now common, but then uninvented, unit of metres per second is sadly just a beautiful coincidence.</p>

<p>I agree that combining units of measurements that span civilizations and eras is counter productive.</p>

<p>The measurements I listed in my comment below rely on ratios, not modern day measurements, and the basis of these observations use only one unit, the 1.0011 in. PI to find the correlations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you use the pyramid inch, supposedly discovered by Isaac Newton, to measure the great pyramid at Giza, an astounding array of accurate measurements can be decoded.</p>

<p>The pyramid inch, or &quot;PI&quot;, is 1.0011 inches, or 1.0010846752 British inches.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a small list of these measurements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Great Pyramid is located at the center of the land mass of the earth. The east/west parallel that crosses the most land and the north/south meridian that crosses the most land intersect in two places on the earth, one in the ocean and the other at the Great Pyramid. </p></li>
<li><p>Length of year: The length of a base side is 9131 pyramid inches measured at the mean socket level, or 365.24 pyramid cubits, which is the number of days in a year. [9131/25 = 365.24, accurate to 5 digits] note: 365.24 is the length of the Tropical Year, not the Julian year, which is 365.25 days long.</p></li>
<li><p>Value of Pi: The perimeter of the base divided by twice the height = Pi to 5 decimal places [9131x4/5813x2 = 3.141579+]</p></li>
<li><p>Mass of the Earth: The weight of the pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons. Multiplied by 10<sup>15</sup> gives a reasonable estimate of the earth&#39;s mass (The mass of the earth is thought to be approximately 5.972 sextillion tons. Both of these numbers are estimates).</p></li>
<li><p>The Great Pyramid is constructed so as to maintain a constant temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit. It is also &quot;tuned&quot; to the note F#. The F# chord was supposedly important in ancient Egyptian lore and was equated with the harmonics of our planet.</p></li>
<li><p>Mean Distance to Sun: The height of the pyramid (including the missing capstone) times 10<sup>9</sup> represents an approximation of the mean radius of the earth&#39;s orbit around the sun, or Astronomical Unit (AU). [5813 pyramid inches x 10<sup>9</sup> ≈ 91,850,000 miles. AU= 92,955,807.3 mi]</p></li>

<li><p>If the height of the pyramid is taken as the radius of a circle, then the circumference of this circle is the same as the perimeter of the base. This provided the complimentary squaring of a circle and circling of a square. The key to this relationship is knowledge of the value of Pi and designing the angle of the pyramid to be exactly 51 degrees, 51 minutes, and 14.3 seconds. Circumference=2πr=2π(5813)=36524. Perimeter=9131x4=36524. This number is also almost exactly 100 times the length of days in the year!</p></li>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Giza-Death-Star-Joseph-Farrell/dp/0932813380/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1335484366&amp;amp;sr=8-1">Joseph P. Farrell has taken that hypothesis further in this book by claiming the Great Pyramid could also function as a super-weapon</a></p>

<p>Farrell also demonstrates that even minute measurements like Planck&#39;s constant seem to be encoded in the pyramid as well, suggesting it was created by a civilization that had achieved extreme scientific sophistication.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a lovely little snippet from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>&quot;The Great Pyramid at Giza...was built with a perimeter of approximately 1760 cubits and a height of 280 cubits; the ratio 1760/280 is about equal to 2π. A few pyrimdologists [sic] conclude from this value that the pyramid builders had knowledge of π and deliberately designed the pyramid to incorporate the value. However, mainstream historians believe that ancient Egyptians had no concept of π and that it is merely a coincidence that the ratio of perimeter to height is about 2π.&quot;</p>

<p>Still think it&#39;s all a coincidence?</p>

<p>Edit: fixed typos and added #8 and the wikipedia quote from the article on &quot;Pi&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, I don&#39;t think that the Egyptians were responsible for building the Great Pyramid at Giza.</p>

<p>Obviously this is under the realm of speculation, but I lean towards the hypothesis that the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, and probably the two other pyramids at Giza were built by a civilization that predated the Egyptian era.</p>

<p>When the Egyptian civilization sprung up, fully formed I might add, they likely refurbished the structures (and altered the face of the Sphinx), but nowhere in the history of ancient Egypt (as far as I know) is there a record of them building the great pyramid.</p>

<p>This explains why of the hundreds of pyramids found in Egypt, only the Great Pyramid is so perfect in its dimensions, despite it being the oldest. The hundreds of other &quot;imperfect&quot; pyramids littering the landscape of ancient Egypt were imitations by the less adept Egyptian builders, attempting to mimic the perfect structure that had long predated their civilization.</p>

<p>Although it remains speculation, the more I research it, the more likely this scenario seems (or something like it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the Great Pyramid is incredibly close (1/36th of a degree I believe) to being oriented to true North.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t know if this has already been posted here, but check out Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast with author Graham Hancock.  Hancock talks a lot about the relationship between the Pyramids, the Sphinx and the stars and how it&#39;s possible that the ancient Egyptians could be far older than mainstream archaeology suggests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s the most perfectly positioned structure in the world towards due north. The theory goes that it used to be perfect, but the earth has shifted since then. </p>

<p>And great link, I&#39;ve listened to that!</p>

<p>As I mentioned in another post, I don&#39;t think the &quot;Egyptian&quot; people as we know them built these structures. I think they were built by a much older civilization that was far more sophisticated than we would like to think.</p>

<p>I think this civilization was global in extent, and the remnants of whatever happened to them all influenced the budding civilizations that we know of in mainstream &quot;history&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Interesting discussion. I&#39;m sure you all would be interested by a documentary of 2011: The Revelation of the Pyramids:
<a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-revelation-of-the-pyramids/">http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-revelation-of-the-pyramids/</a></p>

<p>In part 2 it is mentioned that there is a hidden reference to the speed of light; I&#39;ll try to explain it in brief words:
-Take the ground square of the Gizeh pyramid
-From the centre, you can draw 2 circles: one within the square, and one outside, touching just the corners of the square.
-Calculate for both circles the length of the circumference or contour and substract the shortest from the longest
-The result (in meters :-) ) is 299,79 meter.</p>

<p>That is scaringly close to, not to say exactly, 1 millionth of the speed of light per second. The error is less than 1 cm on the length of 230,4m of a side of the pyramid. Change the size of the pyramid with a few meters, and the magic is gone... - There is only one correct size to make this match.</p>

<p>The precision is too high to speak of coincidence. This means that the makers of the pyramids knew the speed of light. I carefully chose my words: I am not claiming that the Egyptians knew the speed of light; which they did not, according to modern history science.</p>

<p>And second, also related to the discussion here, just my personal thoughts about the fact that the speed of light is so close to 300.000.000 m/s:
-Assume for a moment that it was meant to be exactly 300, and that our definition of the duration of one second is considered correct;
-It would mean that the meter is just a little too long: it should be 0,999308 meters long;
-Meaning an error of 0,6918 millimeters or 0,069 %
Now, if somebody could just explain the odds of that happening? We are talking about choosing a length for our present-day meter that is just half a millimeter too long to be a three hundred millionth of the speed of light per second? Very difficult to accept, but true, according to history (meter first chosen/defined by an Italian in 1675).</p>

<p>That leaves us with 2 big mysteries:</p>

<p>1) the pyramid builders knew the speed of light</p>

<p>2) the second and the meter are defined in such a way that the meter is exactly a three hunderd millionth of the speed of light. But we only started to guess the speed of light since the 17th century, and today&#39;s value is only known since 1983.</p>

<p>A pity that such facts are not seriously investigated by mainstream science...</p>

<p>Please share your thoughts on this?
Have a nice day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just one mistake in my explanation below: when I mention &quot;The error is less than 1cm on 230,4m&quot;, it should have been 10cm. Still, it remains very precise: the error is less than 0,043 %.</p>

<p>I take advantage of this correction to add that for my first point below, the findings are independent of the choice of units of measurements. The conclusion simply is that the speed of light was known to those who designed the pyramid.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all folks.</p>
