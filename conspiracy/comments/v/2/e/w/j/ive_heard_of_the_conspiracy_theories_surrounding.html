        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Why Pakistan&quot; is the hardest bit of this theory to justify, but maybe I just haven&#39;t heard a good justification.  At face value, though, there seem to be a number of problems with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why stage a killing in a way that would alienate a regional ally, unnecessarily endanger soldiers&#39; lives, and risk U.S. technology falling into foreign hands?</li>
<li>Why do it in a public place where people could contradict your story?  Why not just say &quot;we found him in a cave?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is a convincing explanation as to why the supposed fake happened in Pakistan, I&#39;d love to hear it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  If they&#39;re going to pick a country to send a message to, why Pakistan over all other options?  Why not &quot;discover&quot; him in a cave with documents that indicate he had spent time in Iran?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it had 3 reasons, not just one.</p>

<p>In no particular order:
The election issue: Osama did die before, how exactly we don&#39;t know, but we know he was very sick and we know that Pakistani former priminister Benazir Butto on national TV said that he was killed. So the Obama administration had him ready to be rolled out and they were planing on doing this close to the election to boost Obama&#39;s numbers.</p>

<p>The birth issue: Obama was reeling from all the birth controversy and it was at a time when the economic situation was getting worse by the day. He was under consistent pressure and it was becoming a big deal.</p>

<p>Pakistani government: The Pakistani government was loosing support in Pakistan so they decided to be more aggressive in opposing the drone strikes, they were saying we are not going to allow these drone strikes to continue, etc... I mean they are all bought and paid for and the Pakistan intelligence service has tons of CIA infiltrators, so its not like the Pakistani government has big autonomy, but they could give the US a hard time if they wished. </p>

<p>So combining all three events lead to having a situation where there it was a good time to roll this thing out. It would have boosted Obama&#39;s numbers, it would have had a small boost in the market, it would have blow away the birth issue and make Pakistan&#39;s government get in check or threaten intervention against in Pakistan and they know they would be the first that are going to be targeted by strikes. </p>

<p>And it actually did all that perfectly, it had all the positive effects they wanted, although it didn&#39;t last long because Obama is actually really bad and reality hit the markets again.</p>

<p>So its a complex issue, but in limited amount of time these are the basics of why they did it and why exactly then!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is right. Obama had just rolled out an obviously forged PDF of a birth certificate and they needed to get that out of the news fast! I thought all of the birther stuff was total bullshit until that weak-ass forgery was released... now I assume that he must not be a citizen after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah... I remember seeing that. Good call. The more or less clinches it for me. What to do about it? I heard something recently about Article 5 of the Constitution... instructions for how to get a constitutional convention going... the guy I was listening to said that all of the requirements have been met.  Congress has been required to call for a convention since 1913... but they haven&#39;t.  I&#39;m going to research this to make sure it&#39;s right and then try to spread the information. A new constitutional convention could be the bext next move for Americans... a chance to change the game we&#39;ve been losing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bhutto is known to have been a recruit into the CIA.  Her handler made a lot of noise about being upset that she was killed.  She was specifically fed disinfo on Osama&#39;s death.  Handler was upset because he thought compartmentalization led to other teams taking her out even though she was saying what she was suppose to be saying.  Osama is a CIA operative, always has been, and is not dead yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you can do your research, discriminate between actions, policies, and agendas that help people, trace the associations of families, organizations, and states, correlate these with rise and fall of opposing agendas, differences in religious orientation, etc.</p>

<p>At this point you&#39;re more like a PhD in history talking common sense than a conspiracy theorist, which means mostly work and not much room left for speculation, so it isn&#39;t nearly as fun actually having the answers.</p>

<p>You can look at a chart I&#39;ve started building <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/174777717/map-of-the-world">here</a>.  It is really just tip of the ice burg of recent history, but already pretty easy to see how you differentiate between good and bad guys.</p>

<p>What is occurring here is conjecture. It is kind of the opposite of your Orwellian &quot;groupthink&quot;. As far as I know, US and Canadian governments havent outlawed it, yet. I have already had a run in with another paid shill this AM - go fuck yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking at it the wrong way. </p>

<p>The raid in Pakistan was for ulterior reasons. The raid went bad, a helicopter crashed, SEAL&#39;s died, and they needed a cover story because whatever the truth was, it wasn&#39;t going to go down smoothly for the US or Pakistan. </p>

<p>So they covered a botched raid in Pakistan by saying they killed OBL. </p>

<p>What was the raid really about? Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows? In my opinion this is the wrong way to approach this kind of question. Do not expect people who expose the weakness of official claims to also explain why official sources are lying. </p>

<p>There were reports that bin Laden died in 2001. To an extent it&#39;s a matter of opinion what it would take to confirm such a report. In my opinion his death at that time is an unconfirmed rumor. On the other hand, I have seen no convincing evidence that he was alive after that time. All of the alleged confession videos I have seen appear to be obvious fakes. </p>

<p>Why would they make up the story about the 2011 raid? I refuse to speculate. But I have not seen any evidence supporting either that story, or that bin Laden was alive after 2001. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise a good question. I&#39;m one of those who was convinced that Bin Laden was dead before the supposed raid on his compound. If he was dead, the only reason I can think of to stake a fake raid was to get closure on the entire Bin Laden subject around the world. Maybe there was a hidden secondary purpose, such as the killing of somebody else whose name we don&#39;t know.</p>
