<p>As far as your statement that people haven&#39;t left earth orbit since 1972 that&#39;s probably because there&#39;s no need to...  going to the moon was the <em>point</em> of going to the moon, it didn&#39;t accomplish much scientifically nor was it really intended to, it was PR on a grand scale.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t, as there&#39;s this massive planet called the earth pulling at the spaceship with a force inversely proportional to the square of its distance. A spaceship after reaching escape velocity must still spend fuel in order to keep up this escape velocity. This idea that one can just &quot;free fall&quot; to the moon is a common misconception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After watching &#39;Apollo Zero&#39;, I was sceptic myself. But <a href="http://www.vincelewis.net/moon.html">looking into matters further</a> , (also google for &#39;Apollo Zero debunked&#39;) I found out there was a plausible explanation for every single point brought up by Apollo Zero.  They were not able to reproduce the &#39;moon walk&#39; on earth, radiation belt is about 400 or 600km wide, spaceship is going a couple of thousand km&#39;s per hour so it stayed in the belt only a few seconds.</p>

<p>Furthermore, keep in mind NASA sent men on the moon six time, that is Apollo 11, 12,  14, 15, 16 and 17.  Do you really believe they would have gone to the trouble of faking all of those missions? </p>

<p>I have an open-mind on this, but have come to pretty much accept man <em>did</em> go play on the moon after all.</p>

<p>Now, this is not to say there is <em>no conspiracy</em> on the matter. There are still some weird stuff that is hard to explain about the moon.  Why do we not have many decent color pictures? Why so few high resolution images? Why do the ones available have smudges on them? Why perpetuate the myth the moon is a big grey rock when the Russians discovered <em>water</em> <strong><em>and</em></strong> an atmosphere in the 1970&#39;s?</p>

<p>In my opinion there is something fishy about the moon data we have publicly available.</p>

<p>See  <a href="http://www.thetruthbehindthescenes.org/moon-rising-the-nasa-cover-up/">this video on the matter</a>.  Type &#39;moon  coverup&#39; in google for more <em>speculations</em> and <em>different theories</em> people have put out on this.</p>

<p>Keep an open-mind, no matter how convincing some of these theories may sound, <strong><em>do</em></strong> ask questions as you did up above,  and <strong>always</strong> be prepared to reconsider your view.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.”</p>

In an article I read about moon dust the other day on some pro-Apollo website, it said the dust was microscopic, like caking sugar was the words it used. And it said it would hang in the atmosphere of low gravity for a long time. Well hel-fucking-lo...it didn&#39;t even move from under the LM and if it did and they allowed it to settle before show time, none of that shit landed on the pads of the LM.

<p>the dust has no atmosphere to collide with, thus it will not act like the dust on earth. So it will continue along its path until it hits something. It will not hover because it had a directly vertical force applied to it, so it will be physically moved towards the outward direction. Proof of concept pour salt or sugar on your table, and blow in the center. Notice none will return towards the center, but will only move radially outward from the point of force. </p>

<p>Also yes, it would have taken them several minutes after landing to get out of the capsule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got this... The lunar rover had inflatable tires which would have exploded if pre-inflated, and there was no air on the Moon to inflate them. Pro Apollo NUTTERS claim the rover had solid wire mesh tires. Yes the rover in the museum had these fitted in the mid 70&#39;s when they realized pneumatic tires could not have functioned on the Moon. NASA have had 35 years in which to clear up the plainly obvious mistakes within the Apollo program. Each time some one brings up a query NASA correct it and say nothing, ie, they cannot say why the anomaly was there in the first place. Anyway I have pictures of the rover supposedly on the Moon and it has the SAME tires AND tire valves as the one they used at KSC. In other words it is the SAME one. Early close up pictures of the rover on Internet have CHANGED since the blunder was exposed on this web site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more with you on that &#39;fact&#39; about the brightness of the moon as the same applies to Earth! But as for the tyres I&#39;ve seen a few places where they say they would explode if taken filled with air into a vacuum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They most probably filled them there using a pressurised canister of air.   There is no more reason you would fill a tyre until it exploded on the moon than you would on earth.  You&#39;d just need a LOT less air on the moon to get the same effective pressure.  </p>

<p>If you inflated them to a pressure required for use on earth THEN took them to the moon, then I&#39;m sure they would explode, but there&#39;s no good reason why they would do that - think of the space you&#39;d save with deflated tyres.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I got owned on that point, should&#39;ve researched it a bit more haha. The thing that makes me question it above everything else, is the footage of the lander taking off, the thing looks like its made out of tinfoil, and taking off looks like a bad oldschool movie. Somehow it just doesnt seem legit that they made these perfect landings and takeoffs every single time when they couldnt do it in practice. You have to wonder what the odds of that are, questioning that seems fair imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to guess that they weren&#39;t in a high jump contest and may have been worried about breaking something.  </p>

<p>Which would have been really bad, given that even with low gravity if they could have jumped as high as they possibly could, even discounting the lack of flexibility of the suit, they&#39;d land with the same impact that they would on earth.  </p>

<p>OK, actually the impact would be very slightly more, given the lack of air resistance on earth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, the radiation in the belts is composed of electrons and protons trapped in the Earth magnetic field. In short, alpha and beta particles, which can be easily barred by a metal sheet.</p>

<p>Of much higher concern was the exposure to cosmic rays <em>after</em> the Apollos left the magnetosphere. Biopsies from the astronauts tissues indeed presented &quot;scars&quot; caused by the passage of such heavy high-energy particles through their bodies, and those would be a concern in longer missions such as to Mars, possibly requiring additional protection to the spacecraft.</p>
