    <div class="md"><p>Damn straight it&#39;s hypocritical. Idiot Obama also puts Jeff Immelt (CEO of GE) in the position of &quot;job czar&quot;. Well unemployment is still above 8% and GE just so happens to avoid any taxation for several years in a row. And what do you know? GE also has a 50% state in NBC, the most pro-Bama &quot;news&quot; station on tv. This president is completely two faced.</p>

<p>could it be more productive to discuss what we believe are solutions, rather than discussing who&#39;s doing things that we disagree with and/or why we disagree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You first imply there&#39;s no point in discussing it, only to then suggest a topic to discuss - mind you, I haven&#39;t given a narrow topic to discuss; there are countless articles and books on the matter.. Hypocrisy has a way of shedding light on truth - <em>that</em> was the point. You can discuss the science (or lack thereof and why) behind GMO&#39;s, the people financially backing the corporation and their future plans, the people <em>pulling</em> <em>the</em> <em>strings</em> and their affiliations, what to foods to watch out for, where to get non-GMO food, etc etc... </p>

<p>What&#39;s that supposed to mean?</p>

<p>Why?  What do you hope to accomplish by doing so?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what to foods to watch out for, where to get non-GMO food, etc etc...</p>

<p>I think discussing these two things would be beneficial, as they&#39;re at least solution oriented; I don&#39;t think the same can be said for discussing who&#39;s doing things that we disagree with and/or why we disagree.</p>

<p>Sourcing locally produced food is great; producing the food you eat is better.</p>

<p>Obviously the point is discussion; I just happen to think discussing solutions is better than discussing perceived problems, or challenges as I like to call them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first question about hypocrisy: Tupac has a quote/lyric about having enough money for war but not enough to feed the poor. It&#39;s hypocrisy to call that civilized, equal, and fair; it puts things in perspective and lets you see a bigger picture.</p>

<p>Your second question: You gave solution-providing links for the discussion - that&#39;s great! The point of discussion is someone might learn something from you, and you might learn something from them that you didn&#39;t know before. Solutions are great, but one must understand the problem. I&#39;ve had health problems so I&#39;ve done a ridiculous amount of research into this, but I acknowledge that I don&#39;t know everything and welcome discussion because I can still learn something or teach it to someone else. Aside from solutions, it is important to discuss because without talking about the science, it becomes a matter of faith. Knowing Bill Gates&#39; connection to Monsanto in addition to his speech at a TED conference in which he talks of lowering the population should make one wonder; if you know the players and the companies/policies they&#39;re behind, you can be a step ahead in knowing what to watch out for, especially if you know his partners or what to food to watch out for next. Knowing the science can help you convince others of the problem as well; knowing about BT-toxin, its stated purpose, etc etc is part of this. </p>

<p>Does this answer your question?</p>
