    <div class="md"><p>Answer this: Has the government requested to have YouTube videos removed? Did YouTube render such services? If the answer is yes, then they have obviously conspired to censor certain types of information, and if that&#39;s the case, IT ALREADY PROVES THERE IS A MOTIVE, AND THAT THERE IS LIKELY MUCH BROADER IMPLICATIONS.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re willing to outright remove videos, you can bet your bottom dollar they are using other methods to censor information.</p>

<p>What&#39;s worse? Removing videos entirely, or, slowing them down? As far as censorship is concerned, limiting their bandwidth is a step down (in intensity) from completely removing them. </p>

<p>And so, the motive is there, as well as the means. You people always try so hard to make it seem as though conspiracies have no merit, as though the government has nothing to worry about. You couldn&#39;t be more wrong. Dissidence overthrows governments...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve personally missed dozens of videos because I didn&#39;t have the patience for them to load (as intended)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to try and explain this to you, as your mind is clearly made up, and you spend the bottom half of your reply telling me what I&#39;m doing, and how undeniably wrong I am.</p>

<p>Your entire reply is more of a rant, and just fyi, having videos LOAD slower, you would still be able to see them. If the government was trying to stop you from looking at it, adding an extra FIVE seconds to your viewing experience wouldn&#39;t stop you from still watching the video.</p>

<p>If the government was trying to censor what you can and can&#39;t see, making a video take longer to load isn&#39;t going to stop you from seeing it.</p>

<p>I can watch any youtube video here, about any conspiracy, at the same rate I can watch any other youtube video.

<p>&quot;These days, even 400 milliseconds — literally the blink of an eye — is too long, as Google (YouTube&#39;s owner) engineers have discovered.&quot;</p>

<p>If you ask me, it&#39;s a very, very clever way to limit information uptake. Perhaps you aren&#39;t capable of seeing the bigger picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah so that&#39;s the government plan. Expose a nation of A.D.D. and prove to the conspiracy theorists that they are in fact just as impatient as the rest of the world, and they will not sit around and wait five seconds for a video to load.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What bigger picture? Your tale?</p>

<p>You link no videos for comparison, you ask a question that leaves no room for refutation.</p>

<p>Read the last sentence of your original post;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can not be a coincidence...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This CAN&#39;T be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Okay, so then what are you trying to accomplish? You have no interest in being refuted, you have no back-up to your claims, short of that, an article that states people are impatient.</p>

<p>If you were really thirsty for all that knowledge in those youtube videos, you would wait five seconds for it to load.</p>

<p>Please; link me 10 conspiracy videos, that load slowly (or never) and then link me 10 videos that you feel load instantly.</p>

<p>I will tell you if I lag when loading them.</p>

<p>The article you linked does not &quot;prove&quot; anything. A two second delay on a video loading does not make you incapable of watching the video, or incapable of waiting. IF anything, it just proves that you aren&#39;t any smarter than the other people in the A.D.D generation.</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care to continue this conversation with you. You&#39;ve insulted me numerous posts in a row, and I&#39;m not really into discussions like that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You aren&#39;t actually dumb enough to think your sarcasm lends you credibility are you?</p>

<p>After comments like this, I have no interest in continuing to talk with you, if you can&#39;t refrain from saying shit like this.</p>

Fringe <em>anything</em> is not a main source of revenue. They&#39;ve cooperated in numerous ways with the Federal government in the past. Why wouldn&#39;t they try and make the path to enlightenment HARDER. Conspiracy theorists are few and far between, I&#39;m quite certain YouTube could care less about the minuscule revenue potential from such a small subgroup...</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an assumption I came to lightheartedly. I&#39;ve been dealing with this for months, and I&#39;m fucking sick of it...</p>

<p>YouTube used to simply remove videos that touched on certain topics, but by the time they did that, numerous people had copied and re-uploaded them. This seems like a much more effective means to secretly censor the public.</p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;ve worked for the US government. Theyre far too fucking stupid to pull of something like 9/11. </p>

<p>Look, they&#39;re either stupid enough to let idiots catch on about their super secret dealings, or they&#39;re smart enough to pull off the greatest con in human history. You can&#39;t have it both ways. Based on my own first-hand observations, it&#39;s the former. </p>

You chose to subscribe to superficial politics, and mainstream media. You chose the path of least resistance, you chose the path of blissful ignorance.</p>

<p>I&#39;d bet you couldn&#39;t even paraphrase the official version of events regarding 9/11, let alone what <em>really happened</em>. You may have worked for the government, but you&#39;re utterly clueless...</p>

<p>You have absolutely zero credibility here. Go home.</p>

<p>Easy to check, look for a conspiracy video with no description and no tag. If you can&#39;t find one, upload it yourself. </p>

<p>More than likely, the OP is pulling videos that have not yet been transcoded to html5 video. The act of playing those videos begins the transcode operation on the server. It&#39;s slow as fuck. </p>

<p>Its not a conspiracy, fuck-knob, it&#39;s economy of bandwidth. The video with more hits gets more bandwidth. </p>

<p>Your entire reply is more of a rant, and just fyi, having videos LOAD slower, you would still be able to see them. If the government was trying to stop you from looking at it, adding an extra FIVE seconds to your viewing experience wouldn&#39;t stop you from still watching the video.</p>

<p>If the government was trying to censor what you can and can&#39;t see, making a video take longer to load isn&#39;t going to stop you from seeing it.</p>

<p>I can watch any youtube video here, about any conspiracy, at the same rate I can watch any other youtube video.
