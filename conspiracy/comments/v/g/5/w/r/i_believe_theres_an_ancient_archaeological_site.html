        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_Punku">Puma Punku</a>, located near the better known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku">Tiwanaku (Tiahuanaco) site</a>.</p>

<p>Although they are generally considered to be part of the same complex, some have theorized that the astonishing stonework at Puma Punku may have been made by an even <em>older</em> and more advanced civilization than the builders of Tiwanaku.</p>

<p>As for the dating of both sites, mainstream archeology, always reticent to push the dates back too far, puts initial construction at around 1,500 years ago.</p>

<p>The dating of the site isn&#39;t very important to my hypothesis here, but I should mention that many disagree with this conclusion, and some have suggested that the <em>original</em> site could indeed be far older than a mere 1,500 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Posnansky">Arthur Posnansky</a> was one of the first well known individuals to suggest this, dating Tiwanaku to around 15,000 years ago using so-called &quot;archaeoastronomical&quot; techniques.</p>

<p>Although his work has since been discredited among mainstream archeology, writers like Graham Hancock have renewed interest in his work. I find it interesting, regardless of the veracity of his claims, that his date of 12-15,000 years ago brings us to the same time period as the recently acknowledged oldest man-made structure on earth, Turkey&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobekli_Tepe">Göbekli Tepe</a>, a site undiscovered in Posnansky&#39;s time.</p>

<p>As for the society that built Puma Punku, almost nothing is known. If the pre-Incan culture that built Tiwanaku was more sophisticated than the Incas themselves, then it seems entirely possible that whoever made the stones at Puma Punku were more advanced than the recognized culture at Tiwanaku, and therefore much older as well.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, pre-Columbian civilizations were supposed to be ignorant of the <em>wheel</em> (a long-standing belief by mainstream academia that is finally beginning to be overturned), yet they were capable of creating the following...?</p>

<p>Here are a few pictures of Puma Punku:</p>

<p><a href="http://ufo-4.aadityas.com/files/2011/12/puma_punku_stone_2.jpg">another many-sided stone</a></p>

<p><a href="https://sistemasolarunido.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/1280px-puma_punku11.jpg">last one</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Axis-World-Search-American-Civilization/dp/1931882819/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340391620&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=axis+of+the+world">Writer Igor Witkowski has written an excellent book disputing the current model of the early colonization of the Americas</a>, pointing out that although a Northern &quot;land bridge&quot; migration probably occurred, the Americas had long before been populated, as the <em>oldest</em> sites are to be found in South America, inconsistent with a slow North to South migration.</p>

<p>Witkowski, who personally traveled to Puma Punku to make detailed measurements of the blocks, makes a strong case that an advanced sea-faring culture had a major presence on the planet long before the current model allows for one.</p>

<p>Although this hypothesis is sound and not unreasonable, it seems that the Ancient Aliens meme has taken over any rational discussion about these sort of topics. As of right now, the mystery of Puma Punku has <em>nothing</em> to do with aliens, and anyone who lumps them together is doing us all a disservice. </p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4202">this guy wrote an article &quot;debunking&quot; the claims about Puma Punku</a>, when all he does is say: </p>

<p>&quot;So once again, we have an accomplishment by ancient craftsmen whom some paranormalists have attempted to discredit by attributing their work to aliens. This is not only irrational, it&#39;s a non-sequitur conclusion to draw from the observations.&quot; </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t agree more! </p>

<p>It very well may be that &quot;extraterrestrials&quot; were involved, but until evidence for this is unearthed, the more rational thing to do is assume that <em>humans</em> crafted the stones, and they may have done so using a technology that shouldn&#39;t have been around at the time, at least according to the mainstream version of history.</p>

<p>This &quot;skeptical&quot; writer throws the baby out with the bathwater...because the ancient alien meme has infiltrated the interpretation of sites like Puma Punku, he chooses to dismiss the possibility that although <em>mankind</em> should be given credit for the accomplishment, the fact that mankind even <em>accomplished</em> such a feat in such a remote time is an even <em>greater</em> and more majestic mystery than the idea that some lizards came in flying saucers and built intricate blocks on earth.</p>

<p>Sites like Puma Punku can be found around the world, it just happens to be one of the most astonishing (other than the Great Pyramid at Giza, obviously).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nE_rv6RO9Uc">Here&#39;s a video I recently found of some unbelievable stone blocks in Peru, it&#39;s worth watching in its entirety</a></p>

<p>As I think is evident from the pictures, the builders of Puma Punku surely accomplished something incredible, whether or not you believe some sort of unknown technology was employed.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this, any thoughts would be appreciated!</p>

<p>These are referred to as &quot;staples&quot;. They are recesses in adjoining stones where a poured metal link was plased to hold the structures together. The sediment in them has traces of rust and other evidence to support that. This was made by people who were not even credited with the use of metal in any way, be it for tools or weapons. We have much to learn yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I believe that we are in no way the first civilization to occupy the Earth, and by no means the most advanced. I believe that the Earth is much older than we are led to believe, and I believe civilization builds itself up over time until a cataclysmic event reduces the population greatly and basically resets progress. The enlightened people, the privileged, &quot;illuminati&quot; if you will, are aware of this cycle, because of information passed on by their forefathers. They are also presented with information on the ways to build up society, and the results of building up society in certain ways vs. others. All of this information was obtained thru trial and (not necessarily) error, in the many preceding civilizations. This information most likely includes how to set up economic systems, energy sources and benefits of running society through them, secrets of technology, and ways to manipulate the collective minds of the masses. </p>

<p>I believe that with each cataclysmic event, the powerful elite ride out the interim hunkered down in protective bunkers, and emerge whenever it is deemed safe to restart civilization. Perhaps the privileged families spend generations down there. But they keep with them the logs and knowledge of the many advanced civilizations before them, and therefore possess a leg up on others not privy to the knowledge. </p>

<p>Sorry I am rambling and I may have gotten off track, and I could go on, but you probably stopped reading long ago anyway.</p>

<p>The popular notion is that the illuminati are the &#39;elites&#39; and they have gotten there through privilege, when it&#39;s more a case of attaining privilege by being one of the illuminated that survive the turmoil and being in a position to build civilisation to suit/benefit them. </p>

<p>The Amish not using electricity is probably the closest example, but still proves my point. They are a fringe group of people within and supported by the rest of the US (they don&#39;t smelt their own metal ore), and their refusal to use electricity is only partial, not complete. They do have occasional uses of it such as telephones, and motorized manufacturing equipment.</p>

<p>We do that. Not often, but it happens. Nuclear power is one such case. We have had the means for clean, reliable, scalable, cheap power for 60+ years. What do we do? Refuse to build more and continue to run the early custom prototypes for decades after their design life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually attended Giorgio Tsoukalos&#39; conference in Chicago the other day, and Puma Punku is one of this central topics.  I know you don&#39;t want to poison the well by bringing Ancient Aliens into it but given the fantastic nature of the site, it is just as plausible an explanation as any.</p>

<p>Some of his points:
- The official carbon dating of 500 AD is pretty much absurd.  The stonework is obviously much older than that.  Due to the fact that you need organic material for carbon dating, the use of a skeletal fragment for aging purposes means nothing - there could have simply been other people living on the site well after it was constructed.  He maintains that it is around 28,000 years old but admits they won&#39;t know until somebody funds a procedure to actually date the stones.
- The extremely high elevation means no trees were anywhere nearby to use as rollers for the slabs.  And even if there were trees, the logs would be crushed under the sheer force of the 200 ton slabs
- The stones were cut almost perfectly smooth.  Given the hardness of a rock only a diamond would be able to do this.  They debunked the involvement of lasers as they tested it on the rock and it was unable to cut it as cleanly as they are cut at the site.
- It would be extremely difficult to do this even with today&#39;s technology and that is with the use of pretty heavy machinery.<br/>
- The Aymara that supposedly inhabited the area claim that they did not build the sites.  I can&#39;t remember if they claim it was gods or somebody before them.</p>

<p>All of those points were from his lecture.  I planned to do more research into it but I saw this post and thought I&#39;d chime in.  Either way you&#39;re right, i definitely don&#39;t believe that a tribe of Aymara did this 1500 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent summary, thanks so much for adding this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think bringing up ancient aliens &quot;poisons the well&quot;, rather we have to take this once step at a time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t discount that possibility, but the first step is to get people to acknowledge that there are some <em>extremely</em> anomalous sites around the planet and huge gaps in our understanding of history.</p>

<p>People often dismiss these claims when you bring &quot;aliens&quot; into it, regardless of whether or not those claims have any merit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how often we find these ancient ruins and attribute them to certain cultures...when more often than not the cultures <em>themselves</em> say they weren&#39;t responsible for creating them.</p>

<p>We trust our own &quot;foolproof&quot; methods of dating and standard historic timeline more than the peoples themselves, no wonder we&#39;re in such a state of ignorance.</p>

It&#39;s both a reference to the star and a play on &quot;Iraq&quot; given that the book draws inspiration from the conflict in the Middle East.

<p>Selective reading much ? </p>

<p>&quot;Mu Draconis is also known by its older name Alrakis,[1] [2] which is derived from name given to it in Arabic by Arabian stargazers, al-Rāqiṣ, &quot;the Trotting Camel&quot;[1][3] or &quot;the Dancer.&quot;[2][3] This name is also sometimes spelled in the English as &quot;Arrakis&quot; or &quot;Errakis.&quot;[3]&quot; </p>

<p>Science fiction writer Frank Herbert chose Arrakis as the name of the primary planet in his famous Dune series of novels, aware that the word &quot;Arrakis&quot; is the transliteration into English of the Arabic words for &quot;the dancer&quot; (al-Raqis)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That... pretty much summarizes exactly what I just said.  Raqis and Iraq are not related etymologically and Herbert was probably (note, citation needed) referencing it along with drawing an analogy to Iraq.  </p>

<p>If you have evidence that Iraq is etymologically related to Raqis, go ahead and post it.  I won&#39;t hold my breath, just like I won&#39;t hold my breath for your single-star star-map.

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that there were civilizations long before the recorded history, that were as advanced as we are (if not more advanced).... and for some reasons they were no more... and we find what&#39;s left of them and scratch our heads. Just imagine, if an earth changing cataclysm destroys our civilization, our scientific advances would disappear for ever. A future civilization that will rise from the survivors would not understand our ruins... and in few thousands of years, gues what would be left? Probably the Pyramid of Cheops, Puma punku and few other ancient ruins. Almost nothing would be left from us.
Also, keep in mind, a future civilization that rises from our ashes would have hard time getting to the level we are. There are no more metals and minerals left that are easy to mine for. Same for oil, they won&#39;t be able to get to it.
Anyway, I truly believe that there is more to ancient history than the official history text books teaches us. I&#39;m not saying that some know the truth and won&#39;t tell us, is just that the main stream Archaeology cover their ears and yell &quot;lalalala, I can&#39;t hear you&quot; when a fluke is presented. How many history professors would have to dismiss their own papers and publications if the official ancient time line proves to be wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few flaws in your assertions. As to ancient civilizations as if not more advanced than our own; Not likely in a sense. Those ancient structures are works of master craftsmen quite possibly using some methods we don&#39;t grasp. However, the build of the structures is chunky and without much grace. If they had been as advanced structures would be more delicate and sophisticated. </p>

<p>As to the future; There would be many many traces of us to be found. The 3 gorges damn, parts of the empire state building, the footings of large bridges like the Golden gate. As well asm many many other things. Metals will be available just in a different manner. They may not find ore and have to extract from veins of the stuff, but they will find piles and piles of it under the acumulated sediment. And finaly oil. Oil is renewable in terms of long time frames. Bio material will break down to create more oil for them.</p>

<p>I never said anything about flight or internet, but as far as advanced medicine, here&#39;s a quote from Bolivian archaeologist Javier Escalante:</p>

<p>&quot;The Tiwanakans learned to control their environment and put to use the abundance of water by installing systems for irrigation and drinking. They constructed bridges and roads and paved them with flagstones with the purpose of uniting principal centers. They developed an advanced astronomical calendar which they could use to precisely determine seasonal changes and days of the solar year (365.24 days!).</p>

<p>Some studies of pre-Colombian times affirm that Tiwanaku launched the first and oldest technological revolution on the continent. Medicine, cranial operations and the use of quinine required specialists trained in the area. These Tiwanakan &quot;doctors&quot; intensely researched the medicinal properties of multitudes of plants whose benefits are still used today.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems the further back we go, the more sophisticated the people...</p>

<p>I think these stones display characteristics that are far more anomalous than you give them credit. But you&#39;re entitled to your opinion, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re being rude :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but this isn&#39;t as special as you&#39;d think. The Romans had some pretty sophisticated industrialization going on around their peak (a few hundred years before this place was built), and the concrete and roads they built are strong enough to survive today, the former of which we don&#39;t know how they made either. </p>

<p>The fact that this is in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> indicates to me (I could be wrong, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not) that OP is implying that there was a society so advanced that there&#39;s some kind of conspiracy in place to cover up this advancement to stop people questioning the established historical story, or aliens, or something like that. I don&#39;t think this is evidence of anything like that. </p>

<p>That all being said, I&#39;m ready and willing to accept that these people have much more advanced tools than we&#39;ve traditionally given them credit for, but not much beyond that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my response would be that, ok, maybe we could create something with this precision, but to be able to do so requires a sequence of evolutionary steps that simply <em>don&#39;t appear to be there</em> in this case.</p>

<p>Simply put, <em>there is no developmental antecedent</em> to the technology apparent at Puma Punku. </p>

<p>Sure we might be able to pull off something similar today, but that&#39;s because we have centuries of practice and centuries of evolving infrastructure and technology at our disposal.</p>

<p>As far as we know, these people didn&#39;t have this extremely convenient advantage.</p>

<p>Put in this context, I definitely think the achievement is on par with what we can do today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look where our society is going today. Greener, renewable, recyclable. In a few decades, we will probably be combing through the landfills to filter out and reuse the raw materials, not because it&#39;s cheaper, but because we want to undo the damage. New products are increasingly made of lighter, thinner and biodegradable or recyclable materials. Dispose them and over time, nothing will be left.</p>

<p>Someone else mentioned in this thread that modern buildings erode over a couple hundred years and they are right. They would crumble, fall, rust and get buried. If you found one in ten thousand years, you&#39;d have echoes of footprints and streets only. If you had a fundamental belief that people of this time were primitive, how would you explain that? Temples? There are only a few in the center of most cities.</p>

<p>Look at our computers and data storage... smaller scales means more fragile. How many people can rebuild a computer and access information if we have a catastrophe? How far back in technological capability would your community regress if you were cut off from the rest of the world for an extended period? Would you even have electricity? Could you melt steel? I can build computers out of parts, but I don&#39;t know how to print an LCD or etch a silicon wafer.</p>

<p>An advanced society, where every tech center is dependent upon cheap energy to move their supply chain from other tech centers, is fragile.</p>

<p>Thrown in a significant event that wipes out 50% or more of the population and the network fails, the electrical grid fails, the parts stop moving, the fuel stops moving, the mines stop working, people go to survival mode and we&#39;re back in the stone age most places. All the poor agricultural regions and overpopulated zones experience massive secondary die-offs.</p>

<p>And the only artifacts that survive the next 10,000 years are those built by eccentrics that wanted to make something out of basalt.</p>

There is a lot of questions to be asked about Puma Punku and not a lot of answers. One thing to bear in mind is that nothing made by human hands are ever the same...my biggest question is how they managed those intricate cuts and why? These are cuts that even today we would have difficulty with. If this were the mass work of humans..who were they, why and how. Why do we have no record? </p>

<p>When did you go? How difficult was it to get there/deal with the altitude change? Did you get a sense from other tourists that they believed the site to be something...more?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last summer around the 100th anniversary of the rediscovery of Machu Picchu.</p>

<p>We jumped off from Puno which required a 6 hour car ride to the border of Peru/Bolivia and then another 2 hour car ride...it would have been easier to use La Paz, Bolivia as the jumping off point.</p>

<p>The altitude didn&#39;t affect me too bad...they say to chew coca leafs to combat the altitude sickness.</p>

<p>There actually wasn&#39;t all that many tourists there.  I think it has been only recently that Puma Punku and Tiwanaku have become &quot;famous&quot;. </p>

<p>The guide himself was pretty dismissive about the whole ancient alien angle, so I didn&#39;t press for any other non-mainstream questions.</p>

<p>I do know of one theory that states Puma Punku used to be a harbor on the banks of Lake Titicaca, which the present day shoreline is now 20+ miles away from the complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you look at the timeline for homo sapiens you have basically full development at approx.  200,000 years ago.  You have fairly extensive records going back approx. 8,000 years.  You have just trace evidence going back approx. 60,000 years.  Given the range of homo sapiens and the blank spots in the history it is likely that civilizations rose and fell without us having any inkling of them.  If, say, a civilization rose and fell between 125,000 and 120,000 years ago, while it would have be equivalent in time to our recorded civilization, with perhaps corresponding complexity, this far out in time we would be left with very little evidence of it.  Most structures that identify our civilization will be unrecognizable as such within 10,000 years and utterly obliterated after 50,000-100,000 years.  The idea that there could have been great civilizations that rose and fell undetected by modern man is not a far out whacko idea.  Many distinguished scientists have speculated on this.  A large number of scientists actually hold this out as a probability. PS...there is really no need to reach out for aliens.  This can all be explained quite logically without reaching out for the supernatural. </p>

<p><strong>The Coso Artifact</strong>
&quot;While mineral hunting in the mountains of California near Olancha during the winter of 1961, Wallace Lane, Virginia Maxey and Mike Mikesell found a rock, among many others, that they thought was a geode - a good addition for their gem shop. Upon cutting it open, however, Mikesell found an object inside that seemed to be made of white porcelain. In the center was a shaft of shiny metal. Experts estimated that it should have taken about 500,000 years for this fossil-encrusted nodule to form, yet the object inside was obviously of sophisticated human manufacture. Further investigation revealed that the porcelain was surround by a hexagonal casing, and an x-ray revealed a tiny spring at one end. Some who have examined the evidence say it looks very much like a modern-day spark plug. How did it get inside a 500,000-year-old rock?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the Ancient Aliens angle, though the show reaches too far at times. Its important to have Open minded skeptics like myself to keep it real between the iwanna believers and the kneejerk naysayers. To the believers: keep an open mind, you have plenty of time to test your hypotheses. To instant naysayers, be like Sherlock Holmes and find proof to whittle down the possibilities, as long as you remember what ever explaination is left, no matter how absurd- must be the truth.</p>

<p>Diorite is an extremely hard rock, making it difficult to carve and work with. It is so hard that ancient civilizations (such as Ancient Egypt) used diorite balls to work granite. Its hardness, however, also allows it to be worked finely and take a high polish, and to provide a durable finished work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Puma Punku ruins are so perfect and well done that we would have trouble doing it right now, and for sure we won&#39;t waste our time, we would find a simpler solution... because doing it like they did it would be way too expensive and time consuming (even with our computer controled mills, CNC). Who in the right mind will think that something like that can be achieved with stone tools by people that - supposedly - didn&#39;t yet discover the wheel? The problem is that the mainstream archaeology doesn&#39;t look at anything that doesn&#39;t fit with the official story. Also, there is not just one rock, it&#39;s a lot of them, identical to each other. The pieces are made like... they came off a line in a factory. Open your mind and study for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are discussing huge plausibility of some significant civilization forgotten in the past, or possibly purposely forgotten, maybe connected to ancient aliens, and this individual is trying to set it within her scope of belief structure, timing the civilization before &quot;the great flood&quot;</p>

<p>Me, being open minded and open for discussion of facts and theories, vehemently reject all notion of the biblical scriptures being true, or even remotely factual based, and feel that someone suggesting otherwise is doing nothing more than writing stories or creating fan fiction.</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s delusional, and discredits the legitimacy (if any) of this claim.</p>

<p>I&#39;d prefer this forum be dedicated to facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is an ancient text that talks about historical places and events known to have existed, the Book of Enoch for example can be corroborated with ancient Sumerian tablets but the key is to not place so much importance in them yet draw from the anthropological theories that existed, the Book of Enoch has a different view of the Annunaki as the Sumerians and in this contrast I think something may be learnt.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may have jumped the gun a tad, I&#39;m sorry. I suppose it is possible to talk about the feasibility of a great flood happening without looking at it in a biblical nature.</p>

<p>After many long discussions and debates and books read, articles gone through, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that 89% of religious discussion is not logic or factually based but based on tricks lies and deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you recognize you might have rushed to judgment there, a tad.  I also understand your position.  I held it myself for awhile, so I get it.  When you consider that the Bible is far from the only source that mentions a great flood,  I think it&#39;s worth looking at all the sources to see what they have in common.  At least as a contrast/ comparison sort of deal.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with your assertions about religious discussions although I do believe there is a lot of misinformation around religions/beliefs.  On all sides of the issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know the notion of a time period that has seen many floods is not solely found in the bible. Many ancient cultures around the world have flood stories. Keep in mind that 18000 years ago we were in the middle of an ice age, and that there its  LOTS  of evidence of the flooding as the glaciers receded. 
&quot;The most recent glacial period peaked between 22,000 and 18,000 years ago. At its height, about 27 percent of the world&#39;s present land area was covered by ice (compared with 10.4 percent today). There were glaciers up to 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) thick over most of North America, northern Europe, and northern Asia, as well as the southern portions of South America, Australia, and Africa.&quot;
&quot;The large ice sheets locked up a lot of water. The sea level fell about 450 feet (137 meters) below what it is today and exposed large areas of land that are currently submerged, such as the Bering land bridge, which connected the eastern tip of Siberia with the western tip of Alaska.&quot;
So while the fact that it&#39;s in the bible doesn&#39;t make it true, doesn&#39;t nessicarily make it entirely false either. Just sayin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Angels, demons and God are fabrications of the human mind, created by man to explain the world, and to make sense of everything.</p>

<p>Our minds have an incredibly complex facial recognition system built in. Among other things, huge portions of our brain are hard wired to find and recognize patterns. Sometimes we experience hallucinations, and they can feel incredibly real, but they&#39;re not.  Studies suggest that near death experiences and religious encounters might be linked to our bodies own production of the tryptamine dmt.</p>

I don&#39;t claim to be a tunnel making expert, but I&#39;m 98% sure that any smooth surfaces you see in a tunnel are concrete; it seems amazingly inefficient to cut the stone smoothly/that accurately.</p>
