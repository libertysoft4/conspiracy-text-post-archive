        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So as many have you guessed this account(sanswork) is actually owned by a professional poster.  I&#39;ve found a new position however that I&#39;m more comfortable with so I&#39;m going to retire this account publicly and answer any questions you may have.  There are some questions about my employers I won&#39;t answer however as I do not wish to be sued.  I will also continue posting on this account in other forums since it was actually my personal account before I got into this position.</p>

<p>About a year and a half ago I was contacted by a company as I had apparently indicated through comments my dissatisfaction with my work somehow.  I had an account with a bit of history and through connecting my personal information was found to have a solid knowledge of the reddit community from previous accounts(been here since the beginning on my previous account).  I was offered a not super salary but it was good enough for what the work was(to continue posting in the forum).  Unlike the previous shill story posted a few weeks ago I was given no talking points, folders or made to visit an office.  I work from home and was simple told to question every theory and to build confusion and questioning.  I&#39;m a natural devils advocate so this seemed like an easy and perfect job for me.  I was also instructed at this time to gradually work into it and to not just jump in making tons of posts as that would raise too many flags.  Clearly over the past two months I&#39;ve gotten a bit too involved personally in the discussions and have done so anyhow.  My employers were not a government entity nor what I recognize as a military contractor though I could be wrong.  I&#39;m not exactly worried about my personal safety as my story is easily discredited.  So anyhow.  Ask away.</p>

<p>Edit: finally off to bed.  Will try to answer any new questions when I wake up this afternoon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does my happiness have to do with it?  Pretty small-minded assumption - that I corrected this for <em>me</em> somehow.  What shit.  How the fuck does that benefit me in the slightest?  Exposing myself to the defensive stupidity of hordes of idiots is not exactly <em>fun</em>, you know?  And why would this make me happy?  Just knowing that people like you are in the world excitedly and proudly defending their right to be wrong makes me vomitously depressed.  So no, I&#39;m not happy at all.  Does that please you? </p>

<p>Also, your hyperbole is rather trite.  There are countless things more annoying than all-caps corrections.  For instance, idiots defending their poor wield of their native language.  How about that?  Pretty spurious contention there, genius.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, but it is feasible that a shill may just need to poison the well generally.  I&#39;d say that what makes this more unlikely is sanswork admitting this and not being worried about his &#39;handlers&#39; . He says he doesn&#39;t think he is working for the government or military but how would he know who he is working for ultimately.  He is not stupid and would realise that anyone wanting to poison conspiracy discourse is either government or big business with deep pockets and so blowing the whistle would be rather dangerous perhaps.</p>

<p>I wonder if he will answer any questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... you&#39;re a sociopath then.  </p>

<p>Listen, I&#39;m not going to sit here and pretend that the discussions that happen here on this forum have any importance at all (by-and-large, they are completely insignificant).  However, you know that you are spreading propaganda for someone with an agenda to avoid truth from surfacing, right?  If you connect the dots, you&#39;ll see that whoever is at the end of the rainbow and writing your checks, or possibly the person writing THEIR checks, is a very bad person.  And we&#39;re not talking about little white lies here.  We&#39;re talking about the cover up of deprivation of human rights, genocide and the eventual complete degradation of society.</p>

<p>I know that there are plenty of people who can live with that reality... but I couldn&#39;t.  Not in a million years.  And it&#39;s not for the future of the society, or the future of the country, or even my children.  It&#39;s the knowledge that I used my time on this earth to contribute negatively, and intentionally subverting people trying to do good work.  </p>

<p>Good for you to find a new gig, but I&#39;m torn... I&#39;m not sure whether to hope for your sake that you are being truthful and really do feel no remorse for the negative impact you have had on humanity or to hope for society&#39;s sake that you do have a conscience somewhere in there.  Either way, I hope that moving forward, you make more positive decisions and do something that you can be proud of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I think a fair amount of rational questioning can be a good thing for this community. The fact that you were paid to be hyper-skeptical(i suppose) is certainly concerning as I believe the self-evaluation of post should organically come from the community.(obviously). Similarly to a comment posted above, the efforts of a shill should be negated by the research and knowledge base of the community itself. Anyway, I personally appreciate you coming forward. I don&#39;t personally blame you for accepting the position because of the current dire economic situation, the benefits of working from home, ect,ect.</p>

<p>My question: Does your personal philosophy align with the general ethos of r/cons -- Is there a bit of cognitive dissonance at play as you knowingly take money to subvert the discussion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, what are your sources? What is your knowledge-base of these world leaders hinged on? </p>

<p>The way I see it, these are individual actors, with unique perspectives and opportunities that have been presented to them via the social-networking they participate in. People network with each other about a wide range of things; these very wealthy and influential people happen to network with other wealthy and influential people about how they can mutually support their business models. Historically speaking we can successfully prove that fraternal brothers will support one another and cohesively mold their actions based around similar ideologies. The ideologies are what can definitively be spoken to, based upon the written and spoken works of said influential actors. From an epistemological stand point, we can&#39;t certainly KNOW a great deal. We can; however, develop patterns of association and form a belief or a solidified image of what/how reality is manipulated by individuals working within their &quot;elite&quot; social-networks, their &quot;good-ol-boy clubs&quot;.</p>

Also in my previous life in working with a lot of wealthy/powerful people you see the same personality &quot;faults&quot; over and over.  Those &quot;faults&quot; are great for getting to and maintaining status but cause a lot of other problems.</p>

<p>Snakes in suits is another fun read though not totally as on topic I still feel its relevant to the elite class.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why would someone genuinely waste so much of their personal time arguing with an entire subreddit, near-constantly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve explained this numerous times. I waste so much of my &quot;personal time&quot; hanging out on Reddit because I have no choice. I have three different heart conditions and I am locked to sitting in a chair, on my couch, or laying in bed. I literally get no time to do anything, so I spend an enormous amount of time on Reddit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sure as fuck can think of better things to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Name some better things I can do when I can&#39;t leave my apartment. Here&#39;s the kicker; it can&#39;t include lifting anything more than 10 pounds, or walking around for more than 20 minutes at a time without sitting down.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a shill, not even close, I just speak out when I disagree with something, and I speak out when it&#39;s fairly obvious that someone is simply being ignorant.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been retardedly screwed over by the government due to loopholes in the system nearly my entire life due to my medical conditions, so I&#39;ve had more than enough reason to dislike everything the government does.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean I let a confirmation bias rule my decision making like so many people here do. Critical thinking is the most important part of figuring out the truth, and if you can&#39;t think critically and you can&#39;t look at things objectively, you&#39;re not searching for the truth, you&#39;re just creating fantasies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, users, I am the unofficial SRD ambassdor bot, here to quickly explain exactly what SubredditDrama is.</p>

<p><a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> (SRD) is a meta subreddit dedicated to aggregating the drama on Reddit strictly for observing and discussing. Although the bot above, susanne_albrecht, would like you to think that SRD is an invasion subreddit, drama is never submitted to SRD for the purposes of causing drama or swaying discussions in their favor. That would kind of defeat the purpose of observing drama anyways.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose to follow the link provided by susanne_albrecht into SRD please read the sidebar before participating.</strong> You&#39;re welcome to participate in the discussion, but SRD is not another platform for your drama.</p>
