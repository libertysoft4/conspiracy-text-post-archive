        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s a good example of what I&#39;m talking about in the OP. Let&#39;s say you and I are both perfectly non-partisan. And I show you <a href="http://countrysideanimalhospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/highres_33955341.jpg">this picture</a>.</p>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>If I was to say, &quot;This might sound a little crazy, but I&#39;ve got pretty good information that dog there is working with a human to make those sheep go where the human wants them to go.&quot; How would you respond?</p>

<p>Thinking adults that have followed the narrative would respond </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sure, of course. That makes sense. I&#39;ve heard examples of that before. What of it?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, Modern American &quot;adults&quot; are far more apt to adopt a different response: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re full of it. Where&#39;s the evidence of a man? Is there a second angle showing the man? Why would the man do such a thing? There&#39;s no clear motive, and that doesn&#39;t sound like the way a man would choose to spend his time. I personally know a few men, and they are upstanding people. They would never do something so pointless and obviously stressful for the livestock. Besides, how would the man keep that a secret? Surely we&#39;d know if he was orchestrating dogs to perform as some kind of guidance counselors, a-har-har-har!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me show you <a href="http://takethesquare.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/blockupy1.jpg">another image</a>.</p>

<p>Here the dogs stand in solidarity with the sheep. This unity is our only chance at freedom from the farm. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t just nutters with too much time. They are people just like you that found out things might not be as we&#39;re told and want to do something about it. We are tasked with the Duty of being the uncomfortable cornerstone of the State, sitting askew to prescribed fittings, working in a contradictory manner to force checks on abuse of symbiosis. Or forever forefeit this, our only planet.</p>

<p>We cannot effectively do this without education first. And our traditional education apparatus is very pointedly designed to give us the education we&#39;re told we need, making it not always the TRUTH</p>

<p>See the nature of the cage around you with eyes unclouded and you will never question your desire for freedom again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, that&#39;s good old cognitive dissonance for you. Most people don&#39;t respond favourably to having their happy, ordered little world torn down around them. Far easier to stick to the established narrative and just keep the hamster wheel moving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you&#39;ve read the conspiracy handbook.  The first rule of being a CT is that everyone who disagrees with you is either a paid shill or has cognitive dissonance.  Seriously, I&#39;ve never seen that word thrown around so haphazardly before finding this place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I wonder, is if the net effect is people get to live their lives to their own satisfaction, then what is the problem?</p>

<p>I think some of the people you are referring to as keeping the hamster wheel moving, are doing so because they don&#39;t mind the ride on that wheel so much. Or at least, changing it would be more effort and have to many unknowns that they are not comfortable with. Sure, they may think some of the ideas presented by your typical CT in the wild might have some truth to it, but what is the alternative they might think? As long as people aren&#39;t given stars and rounded up to be sent to the showers, why not allow the powers that be their power?</p>

<p>At least, that&#39;s what I suspect is the rationalization most use to ignore any &#39;strong evidence&#39; you might show them as a CT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here, but Europe. The whole &quot;phenomenon&quot; of labelling and identifying conspiracy theorists is not that popular in Europe. Quite in converse: historically, sociologically knowledgeable people are usually very cautious when judging the government (no unfounded praise, no unfounded insults, but usually very critical). They would be labelled as conspiracy theorists in the States, from what I read. Quite honestly, no offense to anyone, but I think this whole &quot;anti-intellectualism&quot; started in the US and is rooted the most in the US (<em>Amusing ourselves to death</em>, Neil Postman). The only reason American anti-intellectualism is reaching Europe is because of Hollywood and American show business. Other than that, I&#39;m pretty happy where I live with people&#39;s generally high level of intellect. :) Glad to learn that anti-intellectualism is weak in Canada.</p>

<p>Could you explain why Canadians are so &quot;unlike&quot; Americans and &quot;more&quot; European in this way, even though you guys are neighbours ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the difference between the USA and Europe is Europeans are taught how democracies are supposed to function and their part in keeping it a democracy, also the mind numbing over the top ‘patriotism‘/nationalism is not popular in Europe since Nazism. In America it seems most people think that being a ‘good American‘ entails consuming a lot of junk and not questioning anything their great leaders tell them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here I&#39;ll put it like this, canada is a &quot;COUNTRY&quot;. America is a &quot;country&quot; of states. This means most canadians spread from the same regions and have done little spreading since, this could have caused the result of most canadians sharing very liberal views. hell historically our &quot;conservative&quot; party has been central left. Just look at how early canadians abolished slavery and without a civil war, aswell as abortion and LGBT rights. We all just get a long, apart from some people in the provinces pointing to alberta and quebec with snide comments (i can say the same i disagree with the current political going ons of this country, whatever I don&#39;t hate the people of canada) no one seems to dislike anyone else. Whereas americans will constantly say things like &quot;fucking east coast and/or westcoast, fucking south, fucking hippie liberals&quot; etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always refreshing to speak with &quot;outsiders&quot; who aren&#39;t subjected to the same propaganda as us.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what country you are in. All world powers work to hide the negative aspects of their workings.</p>

<p>When I talk with friends in Germany, they speak openly about their understanding of the USA&#39;s motivations behind certain actions (political/military) yet the same views in US soil would be &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

<p>Once such example was a conversation with a man who lives in Singapore 8 months per year. He was talking about HAARP, and the evident environmental impacts they had, and one of his associates was also contributing to the discussion.</p>

<p>Neither of these guys are conspiracy theorists, and apparently things like that are not masked so heavily outside of the US. But ask any US citizen on the street about HAARP and its effects on weather, and they&#39;ll probably have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so frustrating to see people do things like, here in Canada, vote for the coservatives, which is voting against their own best interests. Now a year in their policies are starting to have real effects on real people, negative effects, yet these people will still &#39;support&#39; the cons cause...I don&#39;t know, they hate the gays and love the god.

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, the truth about conspiracy theorists is that it&#39;s a game.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows how the political game is played knows that it is all about misdirection and misinformation.</p>

<p>Let the small truths build to the bigger lies,let the others think you are crazy,let those who seek truth think that there is no crazy truths tacked along with those crazy liars.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you believe,it only matters where you can be grouped.</p>

<p>It is all about <strong>CONTROL</strong></p>

<p>But know this and know it well,those who seek truth,not those who are handled theories on a plate and either accept them or discard them based on &quot;lack of evidence&quot; will never know the real picture because sometimes truth hides in small amounts in big lies.</p>

<p>To be a truth seeker is to be a collector of small truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the bulk of conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t vocal and don&#39;t come out with sound logic and well thought out views.</p>

<p>Scroll through the thousands of comments on every youtube video - check how many &quot;intelligent&quot; discussions you see.</p>

<p>Check here, whenever someone disagrees with the &quot;conspiracy status quo&quot; they&#39;re immediately labeled as a shill.</p>

<p>The logic behind truth seeking in conspiracy theorists is something that should be thought of, but to say that there aren&#39;t a giant chunk of CT&#39;s, faux CT&#39;s or not, that aren&#39;t just nutjobs is silly.</p>

<p>If people were taught initially (conspiracy theorist or not) to just critically think and search for the truth, regardless of if it agrees with their claims or not, then we would be in a better place. Not all conspiracy theorists do that, which is a huge part of the problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but due to the mass of what the &quot;popular&quot; conspiracy theorists have become, it&#39;s really hard for me to defend anyone who consistently makes comments like; &quot;Wake up sheeple!&quot;</p>

<p>People who blindly believe whatever the hell they read, whether it&#39;s a conspiracy theory or whether it&#39;s on the MSM, are all &quot;sheep&quot; by that idiotic analogy, there&#39;s no place for it.</p>

<p>There are just as many &quot;sheep&quot; conspiracy theorists, who believe everything they hear.</p>

<p>They&#39;d rather believe all of that than even consider the possibility that it was an inside job - that someone with the power and connections worked to make this happen for their own ends.</p>

<p>One look at where the US was before 9/11 compared to where the US is now will tell you one of two things: either the Terrorists won, or someone (or a group of someone&#39;s) made a decisive move to bring the USA to its knees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they would have you believe that people with wealth and power do not get together and plan things in accordance with their own self interests.  the demonizing of critical thought is an age-old tactic by societal controllers to capitalize on the ignorance of the general population.  history is rife with examples of critical thinkers and people who can connect the dots and tell the truth being executed openly.  as long as the majority of the earth&#39;s human populace refuses to think critically and question everything we&#39;re all screwed together.  &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; is a pejorative that eliminates the literal meaning of the two words and has replaced that meaning with a colloquial catch-phrase that merely triggers the equivalent of &quot;crazy, irrational idiot&quot; in the language center of the brain.  in doing so it has created a psychological association that the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; itself has no real or valid meaning.  as such the very concept that word describes, which is more than one person developing and implementing a plan together, is no longer conceived of as a true reality at all.  those who share true information, accurate historical facts and perspective are instantly derailed by that one simple pejorative and then must spend all their time trying to disclaim themselves from association with the term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your looking at this a little wrong. The main problem, is that people that are commonly labeled &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; have a serious lapse in basic judgement, and give the rest of us a bad name. The public&#39;s view of &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; is someone who does the exact opposite of the (I hate to use this word but it is really apt) sheople; they blindly accept &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; because there some small detail in the facts that can&#39;t be proven. </p>

<p>One of the biggest problems for the masses (besides the blatant lack of intelligent thought) is misinformation. For example, say the world &#39;alien&#39; around a &#39;normal&#39; person and chances are they will say &#39;oh the only people who see those is drunk rednecks out in the country&#39; which is so beyond false it&#39;s frustrating. Another interesting point is theories about the CIA, which seem to be quite popular; but that is for a reason. If you look at what is documented and been released, they did some horrible things to their own citizens, especially with LSD. That&#39;s just what has been released, think about what has not been released; but whenever a story comes out about the CIA doing horrible things people refuse to believe it for some reason.</p>

<p>Well actually most of the time they are.</p>

<p>And on top of that people tend to see patterns where are none.</p>

<p>And to make things even more complicated - there is so much information that discerning truth from lies becomes just impossible.</p>

<p>So unless you provide irrefutable evidence of your point, mocked you will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s a <a href="http://truthoffering.intangir.org/?tag=conspiracy&amp;amp;paged=17">relevant article</a>.</p>

<p>also, while ridiculing conspiracy theories has become as common in america as apple pie cooling in a window (which no one ever sees anymore, by the way), this policy has official precedent only since 1953, with the <a href="http://powersthatbeat.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/why-are-ufos-ridiculed-the-robertson-panel-durant-report-cia/">Robertson Panel and the Durrant Report</a>. Following this action, the CIA began operations under the code name <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=The_CIA_and_journalism">Mockingbird</a> to infiltrate and influence American media in the context of the Durrant Report&#39;s recommendations. We can also fortunately learn from awesome activist action about <a href="http://www.icdc.com/%7Epaulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm">COINTELPRO</a>, an FBI info subversion and psychological tactics program. Further, in &#39;67, the CIA released a memo titled &quot;<a href="http://www.namebase.org/foia/jfk01.html">Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report</a>&quot; that was initially stamped &quot;psych&quot; intended for classification and development within military application by psychological tactics, or Psy Ops. This memo further outlines how the establishment should approach conspiracy researchers with psychological tactics, propaganda groups, and ridicule. Finally, the trend of conspiracy research suppression through shadowy and dubious government action produces new fruit with Obama&#39;s regulatory czar, Cass Sunstein, with a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2010/01/121884/">white paper</a> that recommends literally <em>outlawing</em> conspiracy theorizing. <em>Yikes.</em></p>

<p>As well, we have the evidence of the life of one <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bb/bennewitz.htm">Paul Bennewitz</a> who suffered from the abuse rendered through such psychological tactics and was institutionalized. So, if there were really nothing to the UFO stuff, why did those government agents spend so much time and energy on subtle psych manipulation of Bennewitz? Why would the gov&#39;t waste time, money, and manpower harassing little teeny tiny citizens about conspiracy theorizing?</p>

<p>While there does seem to be a growing anti-intellectual movement, having the establishment make that argument against conspiracy researchers is less the product of true intelligence, and more the product of our intelligence agencies, who have exhibited an interest in developing just such a climate for several decades now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well be it the finest Education there will always be prejudices. There will always be a percentage of people who think in the context of truth as being:</p>

<p>Objective</p>

<p>Subjective</p>

<p>Absolute </p>

<p>Relative</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories are never anti-intellectual. Theories are to always provoke questions. There will always be those of opposite opinions forever such as group cliques with a shared prejudicial opinion. Everyone is a rebel to their own drummer in some part.</p>

<p>It&#39;s those who can&#39;t take opposite opinions as being anti-intellectualism. That have a hard time. If you believe your conspiracy is just then put out your word, and don&#39;t worry what others think. Lest it will stress you out too much.</p>

<p>That is contradictory in itself. What you mean is that you are an atheist. An agnostic would argue that neither believer nor atheist are able to have any proof.</p>

<p>First off, that was just an example. Secondly, that&#39;s not what I meant at all. Just because I don&#39;t have a solid belief that there is a god, doesn&#39;t mean I have ruled it out. I haven&#39;t ruled out that there&#39;s no god either. We (as humans) are just too dumb to know if there&#39;s an answer to this question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know nothing about the dog or the sheep or how dogs can be trained and how sheep can be herded, you would be quite right to question claims about it. If you&#39;ve got no evidence whatsoever besides that single image then you have no evidence that dogs can herd sheep. Believing that sheep(le) can be herded takes many images and experiences that build up over time.</p>

<p>A lot of the education you&#39;re given is what you &#39;need&#39; if what you need is to be a part of the society you&#39;re in. If you were in a tribal or hunter gatherer society your education would be biased toward the skills necessary to survive there. Is this brainwashing too? Deliberate lies and hiding of the truth? </p>

<p>While I can agree that western education systems are &#39;agents of the state&#39; in a Marxist fashion and certainly will be geared toward keeping the status quo and getting everyone to play by the rules, that doesn&#39;t make it <em>all</em> evil and bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s tread carefully here. Considering that a world run by reptiles also falls under conspiracy theory, it&#39;s pretty absurd to suggest that &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is synonymous with &quot;intellectual&quot;. Conspiracy theory often devolves into a cartoonish myth that wraps our slippery reality into a neat little package and denies the validity of others on what basically boils down to ideological grounds: I alone have the truth and everyone else is a fool. Other such packages are communism, capitalism, fundamentalist religion or materialism, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Consipracy Theorist&quot; is only an insult because we live in an age of unrepentant anti-intellectualism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; is only an insult because so many non-nonsensical conspiracy theories have been promoted and popularized so it has changed the meaning of the phrase. </p>

<p>While a legitimate Conspiracy Theory like JFK&#39;s assassination can be accepted by the mainstream because there is a reasonable case to be made, while &quot;faking the moon landing&quot; is a bit less reasonable, harder to believe and easier to debunk. And the 9/11 truther bull-shit was the final nail in the coffin for &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; everywhere. Those yahoos don&#39;t have 2 brain cells to rub together and became the poster children for conspiracies... making all of us skeptics look bad. Which leads me to believe the &quot;Truther&quot; movement is, in itself, a conspiracy to de-legitimize &quot;free-thinkers&quot; and other worthy conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>not a big leap, once you figure out that the government is printing money for banks and making up excuses to start wars.  after all, if greed is the problem, why not take a critical look at the people who are telling you that you&#39;ll go to prison if they can&#39;t suck up 25-40% of every paycheck you earn...<em>rolls eyes</em></p>
