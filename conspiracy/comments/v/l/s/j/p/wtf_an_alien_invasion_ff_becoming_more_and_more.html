<p>A redditor on r/ufos submitted <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/15/paul-krugman-fake-alien-invasion_n_926995.html">this</a> Huffington Post article where <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbf5RO6TfxA&amp;feature=related">Paul Krugman mentions something similar</a>, but <em>in favor</em> of such a FF attack.</p>

<p>Just an FYI here, folks.  Be very careful, and don&#39;t fall for any mass hysteria b.s. by the MSM.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Holy shit.  The bottom of the Huffington Post article has <a href="http://www.dazenews.com/articles/life/michio+kaku+and+paul+krugman+agree+we+need+a+fake+alien+invasion+to+save+the+world/1299">an article referencing <del>esteemed</del> Michio Kaku</a> that says Kaku actually <em>agrees</em> with Krugman and feels that a FF attack <em>should</em> be staged.</p>

<p>Are you FUCKING <em>KIDDING</em> me??  This is the stupidest, most evil, most nefarious shit that you could do!</p>

<p>Again...people, I&#39;m telling you.  Fucking heads up.  Stay sharp, and don&#39;t go falling willy nilly for any fake alien invasion bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pissed...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Allah on the Holodeck
Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq&#39;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators kicked around the idea of creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or showing other such manly weaknesses, or in some sexually compromising situation. The nascent plan was for the tapes to be flooded into Iraq and the Arab world.</p>

<p>The tape war never proceeded, killed, participants say, by bureaucratic fights over jurisdiction, skepticism over the technology, and concerns raised by Arab coalition partners.</p>

<p>What if the U.S. projected a holographic image of Allah floating over Baghdad?
But the &quot;strategic&quot; PSYOPS scheming didn&#39;t die. What if the U.S. projected a holographic image of Allah floating over Baghdad urging the Iraqi people and Army to rise up against Saddam, a senior Air Force officer asked in 1990?</p>

<p>According to a military physicist given the task of looking into the hologram idea, the feasibility had been established of projecting large, three-dimensional objects that appeared to float in the air.</p>

<p>But doing so over the skies of Iraq? To project such a hologram over Baghdad on the order of several hundred feet, they calculated, would take a mirror more than a mile square in space, as well as huge projectors and power sources.</p>

<p>And besides, investigators came back, what does Allah look like?</p>

<p>The Gulf War hologram story might be dismissed were it not the case that washingtonpost.com has learned that a super secret program was established in 1994 to pursue the very technology for PSYOPS application. The &quot;Holographic Projector&quot; is described in a classified Air Force document as a system to &quot;project information power from space ... for special operations deception missions.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m heading out to work but I will try to find more information and the ones where they are claimed to have used this technology despite them saying other wise. It&#39;s a game of connect the dots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, interesting.  I&#39;d like, if I may, to take a look at your original claim and then evaluate it based on the articles you&#39;ve linked to here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this tech exists and was documented being used in Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Washington Post article references one far-fetched idea from the mid 90&#39;s that was dismissed out of hand.  That is hardly evidence that either the tech exists for large-scale projection, nor is it evidence or documentation that it was used in Iraq.  In fact, it states the exact opposite.  From the &quot;Allah on the Holodeck&quot; section of the article - &quot;To project such a hologram over Baghdad on the order of several hundred feet, they calculated, would take a mirror more than a mile square in space, as well as huge projectors and power sources.  And besides, investigators came back, what does Allah look like?&quot;</p>

<p>Now, the author closes his article out with a rather nebulous and unsupported claim - &quot;The &quot;Holographic Projector&quot; is described in a classified Air Force document as a system to &quot;project information power from space ... for special operations deception missions.&quot; &quot;  However, I would point out that this too is an entirely unsupported claim.  He references a &quot;classified Air Force document&quot; that we are supposed to just take his word for?  Unsubstantiated claims from an adjunct Washington Post journalist carry no weight.</p>

<p>The second link you provided I find even more interesting, and more than a little ironic.  You link me to a rationalwiki.org page that debunks the theory you&#39;re trying to provide evidence for.  The page does provide the description of what the theory says, but it also shows exactly why the theory is wrong.  Some interesting highlights from the article in question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The project was apparently supposed to be implemented in 1983, but was delayed. It was then set for implementation in 1995 and then 1996. Monast thought Project Blue Beam would be brought to fruition by the year 2000, really, definitely, for sure. </p>

<p>Project Blue Beam has all the usual hallmarks of a conspiracy theory:
   - It attempts to shoehorn events that have happened, and are happening, into its &quot;predictive&quot; framework, particularly with references to films being used to prep people psychologically for the conspiracy&#39;s dramatic conclusion.
   - It shows a lack of comprehension of the practical psychology of those who are not paranoid.
   - It plays on fears of alleged advanced technology that most people, including its author, do not understand. 
The theory itself cobbles together past conspiracy tropes, starting from paranoia and progressing to technologically implausible plans with motivations that literally do not make any sense.</p>

<p>Proponents of the theory have extrapolated it to embrace HAARP, 9/11, the Norwegian Spiral, chemtrails, FEMA concentration camps and Tupac Shakur. Everything is part of Project Blue Beam. It&#39;s well on its way to becoming the Unified Conspiracy Theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this was discussed for a few episodes of a TV series in the 90&#39;s and then dropped, Occam&#39;s Razor would dictate that the most reasonable conclusion was that it is an absurd premise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes it was a very atypical news report that really struck me for a few reasons.  first, telling everyone on cnn about it would seem to defeat some of the effectiveness of it.  secondly cnn did not usually reveal groundbreaking military tech fresh from the lab.  thirdly it was such an incredibly fantastic type of new tech that i was expecting everyone to be talking about it after that and for it to be very exciting, and maybe even implemented into the consumer electronics sector in some way.  after all, if it&#39;s not a secret then you would expect to see some kind holographic alien invasion or religious experience or something type of attraction at disneyworld and eventually holographic home entertainment displays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, again, that&#39;s just plain ignorant and downright stupid on your part to say that 1) it&#39;s a &quot;complete fabrication&quot; and that it&#39;s 2) an &quot;impossibility&quot;.</p>

<p>A complete fabrication?  I <em>know</em> you don&#39;t mean on <em>my</em> part, right?  Because this is not something I&#39;m making up.  I have no interest in doing that.  If you&#39;re referring to whatever articles I read that mentioned this, then you have to contend with the reasoning they used to make this claim, and FYI, the reasoning they used was not unsound in the least.</p>

<p>Among other things, there is the fact that MUCH archeological excavation has indubitably shown evidence that there existed technology in the distant, <em>distant</em> past (fuck a mere 200 years.  Multiply that number a few times over and you might be nearing the true estimates spoken of) that was able to accomplish feats that we simply haven&#39;t been able to even approximate today.</p>

<p>People have been bending over backward for a LONG, long time now to try to figure out a way to coincide ancient civilizations supposedly more &quot;primitive&quot; technological level of development with a lot of the things that exist from ancient times - like, say, <em>pyramids</em>.</p>

<p>Regardless of all of this, there is actually nothing in the past that precludes <em>present</em> Black Project technology from being what many have claimed it is - i.e. so much more advanced than anything we have in the public sector as to absolutely flip your mind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been said &quot;If you can imagine it, it&#39;s already been done.&quot;</p>

<p>And as far as &quot;impossible&quot;?  Do you even KNOW what the word even means?  Man, you are just plain and simply facepalmingly stupid at this point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing for someone to make a statement that you might not agree with or don&#39;t understand how it could have happened.</p>

<p>...but to say that it was &quot;impossible&quot; is to say that there is &quot;no conceivable way&quot; under <em>any</em> circumstances that current Black Project technology can be up to 200 years more advanced than what is currently available in the public sector.</p>

<p>The sheer stupidity of this statement on your part beggars the imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What is the disclosure that you&#39;re imagining might come from Government?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That ET is here - or that they&#39;ve just received a signal that they&#39;re about to land, etc - and they&#39;re NOT happy and intend to come here and take over/conquer the planet, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think they know about UFOs and aliens that they aren&#39;t sharing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh this is an <em>entirely</em> different issue altogether.  What they would tell the public and what they are hiding are not necessarily the same thing at all.  I don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; they&#39;re hiding a whole truck load of data regarding the reality and existence of ET life.  It has been proven that they absolutely are.  There are mountains of documents and data that have already been disclosed which unambiguously detail not only the existence of ET life, but speak of the direct contact of many races with Earth.</p>

<p>This is no speculation.  This has been a long-documented fact.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/tb/vkji9">This is but one of thousands of documents to this effect.</a>.</p>

<p>Yet what has been disclosed is nothing more than a fractional tip of the ice berg.  There is a LOT more that they don&#39;t let on than there is that they do, of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the complexity of the world, and the degree to which individuals are divorced from much of the reality that is going on around them, I&#39;m not sure that we&#39;d recognize if the alien invasion had already happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very good and interesting point.  Matter of fact, there is quite a bit of valid documentation indicating that not only are there many ET races already on the planet, but that some have long since been here in contact with terrestrial humans.  It has also been said by much more studied people than me that a good argument can be made that some ET races have already infiltrated the positions of power on this planet and are/have been taking over this civilization from the inside out.</p>

<p>I would not immediately discard these theories outright.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surely a race that could travel between stars would be more masterful of subtlety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, I think that while I would agree with this point to an extent, I would also propose that a race sufficiently advanced to travel here would not only be SO advanced as to (as you I believe rightly pointed out) not have much of a problem taking over, but...in reality...a race that has existed long enough TO master such technology has likely also gotten a decent handle on coexisting peacefully with others and aren&#39;t so engaged in ignorant wars of conquest as is the case with this ungodly human race.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;d realize that a slave will be more productive if he is ignorant of his predicament and thinks his actions are in his own self interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes indeed.  Things do indeed get pretty complicated when one considers these two stances where, on the one hand, it can be said that ETs are likely too advanced to even be too interested in taking over this filthy, primitive planet, and - on the other hand - dealing with the idea that if they WERE interested in taking over, what you said very much applies, and the art of secrecy would likely be more effective than out and out primitive war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most effective slave camp is one where the slaves can&#39;t see the fence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% correct, and a good argument can be made that this is exactly what we are already in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real valuable resources could be extracted without us ever knowing it. A whole society nurtured to support a mining operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hate to use a common analogy, but something like the Matrix is one example of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In light of that, if you were the middle man, the &quot;bottom bitch&quot;, the native slave that exchanges the paper for the gold for aliens to extract, would you &quot;disclose&quot;? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a great question indeed, sir.  It depends on who this &quot;middle man&quot; really is.  Is this middle man a human?  If it was I in particular who was this middle man, I cannot say that I would not be contemplating a way to reveal what is going on, understanding even that it would likely mean the end of my life.</p>

<p>I would feel that under these circumstances, the end of my life would be a small price to pay for the possible benefit to the rest of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simulacra and Simulation provides an interesting concept that - while I wouldn&#39;t entirely apply it universally - I definitely feel has a certain scope of validity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could tell you about a personal experience that is relevant to this discussion, that has convinced me that &quot;the government&quot; is as ignorant of the alien presence/agenda as the average citizen, but you wouldn&#39;t believe me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, first of all, sir, don&#39;t count too much on what you think I wouldn&#39;t believe.  I wouldn&#39;t count myself as a gullible type.  I don&#39;t feel that I am.  However, I <em>do</em> know that there are simply <em>sooo</em> many things on this planet that the majority of the 99% have NO idea about that it would be an absolute mistake to discount or discredit a <em>lot</em> of the things that people have to say.</p>

<p>If you do not feel comfortable speaking about it here, feel more than free to pm me.  I would actually be very interested indeed to hear of any authentic, non-trolling information regarding the many things that are going on under the radar of most people&#39;s consciousness.  Again, please feel more than free to.</p>

<p>That being said, however - and with regard to your feeling that the government is as ignorant as the average citizen - I would say two things:  One, there are, of course, many, many tiers of power in structures similar to the government and the military.  There is the &quot;need to know&quot; level of data that a pretty sizable portion of the MIC (military industrial complex) may be ignorant of, and yet those in the inner circle remain very much aware.  I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if many in the government are indeed pretty in the dark.  Most of the 99% I imagine are looked upon as expendable pawns by TPTB.  Secondly, and to this end,  I would say that part of the reason that a large portion of the government is ignorant regarding what is really going on is that they are in no way the ones in charge of this country.  The government is nothing more than a beard worn by those who are truly in charge of what is going on in this planet.  The corporations are closer to the core, but I wouldn&#39;t even go as far as to say that <em>they</em> are even truly the ones in charge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it&#39;s not manifesting as a Government conspiracy to hide something as most people imagine it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  I in no way assume that what goes on is purely (or even predominantly) in the government&#39;s control on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The deals that go on with the off-worlders are happening outside the institution of &quot;Government&quot; and the conspiracy is wider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely, absolutely.  Cannot agree more.  Again, government is just the beard TPTB wear so that the 99% have no idea who and what is running things on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I don&#39;t like using words Alien or ET - they have a connotation in people&#39;s heads which perpetuates a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand.  I think off-worlders is a great term, actually, and I wish it was more common.  I feel about the word &quot;Aliens&quot; the same way you feel about both &quot;Aliens and ETs&quot;.  I feel ET as in extraterrestrial is more neutral, but I do agree that it also has the possibility of conjuring up ideas in people&#39;s minds that generally might not be very accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interstellar travel necessarily requires a very long trip. A trip this length requires more energy than some stars produce in their lifecycle. By the time a race has that amount of energy, to create a wormhole or accelerate mass to high relativistic speeds, there is little reason to cross the distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not if you&#39;re using interdimensional time jumps warps, right?  I know that might sound like sci-fi mumbo jumbo, but I&#39;ve read it said by people with a lot more letters after their name than I that none of these considerations would matter in the least to a race that is sufficiently advanced and has the technology to manipulate gravity, &quot;bend&quot; time/space, and simply &quot;pop&quot; from one area of the galaxy to another hundreds or even thousands of light years away.  It seems at least theoretically possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can create new matter more easily that going to the nearest inhabitable planet to exploit it, if you even reach the level of development where interstellar travel becomes achievable before destroying yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can go from &quot;here&quot; to &quot;there&quot; with relative ease, however, then it might indeed be preferable to actually <em>go</em> to another planet and mine it instead of attempting to create new matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only model that makes sense, is a sublight Generation ship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or a &quot;post&quot; light one not limited by the current manner in which we understand the laws of physics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As not every star features an inhabitable planet around it (inhabitable for any given life form), a &quot;short&quot; 1000 year trip to the nearest star is not likely to result in an expanded interstellar empire as scifi normally depicts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite the contrary, it seems that there might be a possibility that indeed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA"><em>most</em> stars might actually have at least one habitable planet in its solar system</a>.  It would seem, then, that if you combine this possibility with the possibility for faster-than-light travel, extraplanetary visitation would be quite possible indeed and possibly even easy.  Granted, however, I must say that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily suppose that even those races with this possible capability would be interested in &quot;expanding an interstellar empire&quot;.  Similar to what you mentioned regarding your preference of the term &quot;off-worlders&quot; over Aliens or ETs, I would say that the term &quot;expansion of an interstellar empire&quot; seems to connote the possibility of a nefarious energy or interest that I&#39;m not certain really applies to many off-worlders as often as some of us might think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And once you get to the point of achieving an interstellar voyage that can happen inside a normal &quot;aliens&quot; lifecycle, there is no need to expand an empire by force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I&#39;m understanding you correctly, you are saying that a race sufficiently evolved to master (or even successfully use) interstellar travel is no longer interested in the forceful expansion of an empire (heck, the word &quot;empire&quot; might likely be nothing more than a comical misnomer used by a primitive race - us - under these circumstances).  If this is what you&#39;re saying, then I personally would have to say that I would agree with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only model that makes sense for interstellar exploitation is a scenario where the aliens spent at least several hundred years getting here at low sublight speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would disagree with this when taking into consideration the above-mentioned possibilities of faster-than-light-travel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That kind of time in deep space fosters the Space Madness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would seem to be the case for those of us primitive humans that have as remedial an understanding of such things as we do.  I&#39;m not certain it is a universal law that would apply under other, better circumstances, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The species&#39; perception becomes clouded by the immense vastness, emptiness, coldness, and general rarity of deep space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m personally not certain that our understanding of deep space is sufficient to warrant this particular view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once they get where they&#39;re going, their judgment cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>This might lead to an innate desire to protect the preciousness of a &quot;natural&quot; Earth. A primitive oasis. A protected Zoo. Even if the only thing they&#39;re protecting it from is themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, my good man.  I have to admit that I got so caught up in simply responding to the very interesting commentary in your post that I&#39;m finding myself a bit amiss with regard to understanding exactly what final conclusion you are drawing here.</p>

<p>Are you making an argument for or against the possibility of TPTB staging an ET FF attack?</p>

<p>or neither?</p>

<p>Either way I have to say that I enjoyed your post and responding to it.  Again, feel more than free to pm me w/regard to your experience.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

<p>As conditioned as humans are to disbelieve, I don&#39;t think even Barak Obama himself could get people alarmed about the chance of an Alien Attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, I really wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Barak himself would have little to do with it.  He would likely be nothing more than a remedial damage control puppet to the people - much like he is now actually.</p>

<p>And ultimately, it doesn&#39;t really matter whether people would get alarmed at the president <em>saying</em> there might be an ET attack.  It&#39;s not the <em>reporting</em> of an attack that gets people alarmed, brother.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the fucking attack itself.</p>

<p>Think about 911.  How alarmed do you think people would have gotten if Bush would have only come on TV and said &quot;I think we might be getting attacked sometime soon.&quot;  That wouldn&#39;t have done a thing, and TPTB absolutely know this.  They had to actually go through with the attack itself and actually kill a shit load of citizens right in front of EVERYBODY&#39;S face to <em>then</em> get the people to be alarmed.</p>

<p>Nothing like people dying and getting blown up right in front of you to make you feel that whatever threat is being talked about is REAL.  Therefore, saying that Barak himself couldn&#39;t get the people alarmed I think misses the point that TPTB - the REAL powers that be, not the president or those in the white house - I don&#39;t think really have Obama all that much in the loop anyway with regard to what they might be planning.  You have to understand that an ET FF would <em>not</em> involve some sort of president or state representative issuing some sort of announcement that we&#39;re under attack.</p>

<p>Is this what happened before the 911 attacks?  Of <em>course</em> not!  The shit just <em>HAPPENED</em>.  The 911 attacks just <em>happened</em>.  An ET FF attack would likely involve the same type of &quot;terrorist&quot; type modus operandi already used over and over again through the many decades - except this time the &quot;terrorists&quot; would simply be ETs.  The attack would, like all FF attacks before it, come out of nowhere and have a LOT of people dying and getting killed left and right.  This is what would make the threat real and what would get the people to <em>really</em> go &quot;Oh shit!  Help us, big brother!  Help us!!&quot;</p>

<p>Barak would likely have NOTHING to do with any sort of &quot;preemptive warning to society of an impending attack from afar&quot;.  I don&#39;t think it would happen like this in the least because pretty much EVERY FF attack that has ever happened did NOT have any type of warning before hand.  Think about it.  This is what makes all FF attacks all the more credible:  Immediate and deadly attack with no type of warning whatsoever that leaves <em>many</em> victims and casualties in its wake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think if there was some kind of catastrophe, and the Government blames it on ET, that there is any way people would believe it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If TPTB <em>really</em> commit to the FF attack (as I&#39;m confident they would be willing and able to) and, as I stated above, simply ambush, say, NYC or LA and just start destroying shit out of nowhere, I think there&#39;s a chance that the people might get so confused as to believe whatever&#39;s being said.</p>

<p>You saw the movie &quot;Wag The Dog&quot; right?  If you broadcast alien ships soaring over the skies blasting away at shit left and right accompanied by crazed reporting and showing <em>actual</em> people dying?  Yeah, I think a lot of people would simply freak and - in the absolute fear and terror they might have immediately after the attacks - they would likely simply <em>believe</em> any &quot;president&quot; type of official that would go on the air and say &quot;We&#39;re under attack.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that we should underestimate the complicated staging that TPTB would be willing and <em>able</em> to exact in order to pull something like this off.  The studies and investigations into 911 have already shown just how nefarious and underhanded TPTB can be in terms of devising extremely complex FFs and coming up with even more complex alibis to cover their tracks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would turn 9-11 truth on it&#39;s head. Nobody would buy the official story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brother, if an ET FF attack happened, I guarantee you that 911 would seem like a distant, longed-for utopia of fairy tale perfection in comparison.  We&#39;d <em>long</em> to go back to those days.  That being said, nobody would really be thinking about 911 - just like no one was really thinking about the Pearl Harbor FF or all the other FFs before when 911 happened.  Why?  Because 911 was <em>so</em> well orchestrated that no one - at least initially - thought to stop and think that it was anything OTHER than what the administration <em>said</em> it was:  A terrorist attack by middle east Islamic terrorists that &quot;hated our freedoms!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody would buy the official story. Except for people who are already &quot;UFOlogists&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e. people that the MSM works hard at marginalizing and calling &quot;loony&quot;; people that the majority of the 99% are heavily conditioned to look upon with scorn and disbelief; people TPTB make sure are <em>not</em> listened to or believed by the majority of the population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the invasion ships floated overhead, people would think they were having mass delusions or they were freak clouds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Correct.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnUDQyOWbi8&amp;amp;feature=related">Until they start getting fucking disintegrated</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They wouldn&#39;t believe an alien invasion was happening until an alien at their face... and even then they&#39;d think it was special effects (most humans can&#39;t tell reality from movies - even though they disbelieve most of both).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, sir.  Keep in mind that I&#39;m not saying &quot;a false flag <em>threat</em>&quot;.  I am saying a false flag ATTACK.  It&#39;s easy to call fake until the people next to you start getting vaporized.  Don&#39;t think for a second that an ET FF attack would <em>not</em> have an element of very <em>real</em> death and danger to it for whoever is unlucky enough to be in the vicinity.  It would be erroneous on anyone&#39;s part to think this.  People would likely believe because they would be getting killed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are programmed to disbelieve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  TPTB have done a tremendously good job at programming us to be disbelieving idiot sheep.  This is true.  However - and again - all the past FF attacks have shown that a FF attack doesn&#39;t mean the &quot;threat&quot; of an attack.</p>

<p>It means a <em>real</em> attack where people get killed.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m talking about and why I&#39;m saying we need to be very diligent and make sure that we don&#39;t freak out and start screaming for help from TPTB because I wouldn&#39;t be too sure that it wouldn&#39;t be <em>them</em> causing everything in the first place.</p>

<p><em>That</em> is my point.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a word for this but I can&#39;t remember what it is.  But basically this is an example of assigning human traits to an alien being.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good point, and one that should be kept in mind and taken into consideration.  However, considering that a decent amount of evidence exists strongly challenging the notion that our DNA is purely terrestrial in origin, it might stand to reason that there may be a greater similarity between our traits and the traits of at least <em>some</em> ETs than might otherwise be supposed.  This is not, of course, to say that an ET race that is very advanced would entertain certain thoughts in the same presumably rudimentary manner that we do.  This is, instead, to say that - while it is prudent to think just like you did and realize that there may be an extent to which we may have NO idea whatsoever how an ET mind might think or reason (or even if these are applicable words to use for them) - it is also just as prudent to acknowledge the possibility of a common lineage that terrestrial humans might have with certain ETs and, thereby, there may indeed be a certain amount of validity in at least considering certain parallel ways of thinking and reasoning about certain things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is an extent toward which one should be very wary of human analogies when attempting to understand ETs.

<p>That being said, there is quite a bit of evidence suggesting that the human genome is quite a bit stranger than we might be conditioned to believe and, as such, might have very similar analogues throughout much of the universe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are many ETs so different from us as to not even be intelligible by our faculties.  However, I&#39;m also just as confident that there are also many humanoid analogues throughout the cosmos as well.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Exactly.  Now that we as a people are more aware of their nefarious intentions, however, we should be much better able to keep a level head and simply <em>not</em> jump to any &quot;Help me big brother and save us!!&quot; immediate conclusions if and when a FF attack comes - which is exactly what TPTB would want.  We must be strong and <em>not</em> give that to them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Definite possibility, and this is part of what I wanted to discuss with this OP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens exist and when they arrive they&#39;re actually higher dimensional creatures who arrive to impart they&#39;re knowledge to us and the NWO uses that to unite us under their own agenda and keep us in the dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how, exactly, would this be possible under the conditions of this hypothetical scenario?  If the ETs are indeed higher dimensional creatures, I&#39;m not sure that their much greater level of advancement would manifest itself in any evil or underhanded manner.  If their intentions are NOT evil, then TPTB&#39;s intentions would likely be seen through easily by them and would simply not be allowed.</p>

<p>Additionally - and to simply continue addressing your hypothetical scenario - if the ETs were higher dimensional, then why would they <em>only</em> come in contact with the NWO?  What&#39;s stopping them from being able to know who are, in fact, &quot;better candidates&quot; for contact and contact <em>them</em> instead?  Heck, they might contact some poor 15 year old kid from Kentucky instead of a 1%er.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t assume that the NWO or TPTB would be the sole arbiters of the message regardless of <em>how</em> bad they might want to be.  <em>They</em> don&#39;t control that type of message from higher dimensional ETs.  The ETs themselves do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! Ya! I loved reading through that. I heard about the noises awhile back and hadn&#39;t heard anything else since. Really intriguing information presented in that post. Thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>With my second hypothesis, idk. I mean to even talk about higher dimensional beings is so beyond us that it&#39;s all speculative and therefore all open to each and everyone&#39;s own interpretation. Like talking about the 4th dimension. I can&#39;t show you and we can&#39;t even imagine the 4th dimension just talk about it. </p>

<p>That being said, there COULD be good and bad higher dimensional creatures. There COULD be an even higher dimension than the dimension that comes in contact with us. Just because A creature is of higher dimensions doesn&#39;t mean they necessarily have greater power, just more awareness. And TPTB could as luciferians use their occult abilities to contact a creature, above those of the dimension that comes in to contact with us, to subvert said creatures. </p>

<p>Of course since we can never know what we don&#39;t know until we know, that all is hypothetical speculation and COULD be wrong. </p>

<p>Now who they come in contact with. If they do it on a personal 1 to 1 level then the relating of the story to another and then to the masses would be controlled just as any other story is. If it&#39;s done on a mass level awesome! But who&#39;s to say they haven&#39;t before and the gov/TPTB/NWO didn&#39;t just MEN in Black our asses&#39; and will do the same again? Hahaha I&#39;m joking, but it&#39;s all just babble until anything actually happens. Which thoroughly sucks ;/</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  I definitely agree with that - or, more accurately, beings that <em>we</em> interpret as good or bad.  A lion probably wouldn&#39;t think of itself as bad or evil for eating you.  I guess it&#39;s all relative, you know?</p>

<p>That being said, yes.  I certainly know that it&#39;s not necessarily some hard and fast rule that if you&#39;re more advanced, you&#39;re, somehow, automatically benevolent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course and agreed.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, greater awareness can be looked upon as greater power generally speaking, no?  Ultimately everything is everything, and we are all each other.  We are just at different stages of development and manifestation.  This means that we all have the same potential because we&#39;re all basically made from the same basic things and principles.  Certain beings have a greater ability to manifest certain things than others.  We&#39;re all the same though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who&#39;s to say they haven&#39;t before and the gov/TPTB/NWO didn&#39;t just MEN in Black our asses&#39; and will do the same again?</p>

<p>It seems a decent argument can be made that there <em>are</em> indeed MIBs sent to do &quot;damage control&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure if it occurs in the same manner as it does in the movie, but I&#39;ve also come across various reports that talk about &quot;MIB damage control&quot;.  That being said, I feel that there is a limit to their influence, and their power over us is directly proportional to the extent toward which they can keep us ignorant.  It is therefore incumbent upon us to continue educating ourselves as much as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s all just babble until anything actually happens. Which thoroughly sucks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go that far.  I think that there are certain suppositions that certainly <em>can</em> be classified as useless babble, but there are other theories that are based on intelligent and critical analysis of verified observations made by many qualified observers over many, many years.  The things gathered and talked about under these types of conditions I don&#39;t think can be classified as mere &quot;babble&quot;.  They are much more than just that.  :)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Was he being portentous? i.e. warning against the possible, unending negative ramifications that staging something like this could be responsible for?  While I imagine that he may have not been, I think that the negative ramifications of a FF attack might be <em>more</em> likely to occur than &quot;world peace&quot;, as all <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">previous attacks that later showed themselves to likely have been FFs</a> did nothing but tightened the control of freedom from masses more so than had been the case before, almost always resulted in the conquest of more land, and always, always left a sizable toll of <em>many</em> people dead in their wake.</p>

<p>As I said elsewhere in this thread, not only do I NOT feel to any extent that the staging of a FF is the only option for bringing people together, but the truth of the matter is that I personally would actually have no problem with the sacrificing of a large portion of humanity for the sake of the betterment of the planet (even if that means that I myself would be one of the many casualties) if this sacrifice were being conducted <em>by the right beings and for the right reasons</em>.</p>

<p>The big problem with this is that those that would carry out such a FF would more likely be individuals that have already shown themselves to be more intent upon world conquest in the name of the perpetuation of money, power, and greed than it would be any sort of enlightened, evolved beings.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to sacrifice myself at the behest of an obviously greater, much more evolved being for the sake of the betterment of the planet and the race.  However, I am NOT willing to do so for the sake of a small group of piece of shit money hoarders that have already raped the planet and the humans on it of much of their worth.</p>

<p>Well, hopefully nuclear war wouldn&#39;t take place...but damn, I guess he <em>was</em> saying that a FF <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> in fact bring final and ultimate world peace.  That&#39;s cool then because I think this supposition is correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something else that no one has covered, what if TPTB knew of a date of when these &quot;off-worlders&quot; would come back? What if it wasn&#39;t visitors, and a change in our DNA? Our sun has been acting up lately, and our Sun is our God, and our God, is our Sun. </p>

<p>So, let&#39;s say the Mayan&#39;s were right - long-count calender ends on 12/21/12... what if it&#39;s not &quot;the end of everything&quot;, but the end of how we PERCEIVE and RECORD time? What if we saw everything... past, present, and FUTURE. This would give ALL humans PURE control of their future, because we&#39;d know what we&#39;re going to do, how much we&#39;ve been controlled, etc, etc. TPTB would lose COMPLETE control. </p>

<p>There&#39;d be a year-or-so changing period, of our fiat-based printing press economy, house prices, oil, and technology would be completely unlocked. Nano tech, and the such.</p>

<p>What if TPTB knew this date were coming and an &quot;Alien FF&quot; attack were to happen, say, the London 2012 Olympics? The perfect breeding ground. So much masonry, so much control, ROYALS, and control. It would be THE perfect event in THE perfect year, to swing the energy of the planet into CHAOS before this 12/21/12 date. </p>

<p>What if it&#39;s just about plunging ENERGY... so that our planet DOESN&#39;T advance into a better being, upgraded DNA, or whatever is possible. TPTB have a few events this year to pull this off:</p>

<p>London 2012 Olympics
2012 Presidential Elections in the US
12/21/12.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to have them blame an attack on Syria, and then we&#39;ll go into Iran, and finally, Israel - just like the Bible wants us to. Either that, or they&#39;ll blame it on Aliens and then attack these countries in the fog of an ALIEN WAR.</p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

<p>Yes.  This has been talked about a bit by various minds, and I think it&#39;s a sound idea - one that shouldn&#39;t be immediately discarded.  It&#39;s not an &quot;end of the world scenario&quot;.  It&#39;s a changing of the mental and the spiritual guard/energy/vibration.</p>

<p>I think that regardless of an ability to manifest temporal manipulation, TPTB would lose complete control if the 99% just decided to stand up and move forward more than we&#39;ve done up to this point.</p>

<p>This is not an invalid supposition.  It&#39;s definitely something to think about, and I really feel something for everyone to be VERY diligent about with regard to making sure and NOT falling for stupid FF shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thoughts? </p>

<p>I think all your thoughts are not too outlandish or out of the realm of possibility.  I think that, ultimately, it would seem the best thing that each and every one of us can do is to simply work very hard at educating ourselves with regard to what&#39;s really going on in this planet.  Develop and evolve our minds, and begin to do whatever is necessary (meditate, read, exercise, etc, etc - whatever) in order to be as prepared as possible to FACE whatever opposition might accost us with our heads held high and ready to continue walking forward.</p>

<p>While many of us including myself will likely get scared of things, I think it is very important to NOT ACT from a place of fear.  Elevate your mind so that you can literally STILL function logically and know what you should and should not do even though you might be scared shitless out of your wits at the thing that are going on around you.</p>

<p>Wait a minute . . . I&#39;m not sure if you understand the true possible implications of an ET FF attack.  Do you really know what a FF attack by TPTB is like?  It&#39;s not like it would be a cool, fancy shmancy light show up in the air with some glittery lights and some 4th of July fireworks that make people go &quot;Ooooh!  Look!  Neato!&quot;</p>

<p>An ET FF attack might be similar to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">any one of the many FF attacks that have already taken place</a>...the ones that have already cumulatively killed millions of people in this country alone...except it would likely be ten times worse since the public is finally starting to wake up to the attacks as the FFs they are so TPTB would massively have to up the ante in order to make the attack a believable one.</p>

<p>If it would scare you, my good man, it likely wouldn&#39;t scare you for too long because there&#39;s a good chance that you would be <em>dead</em>.  There would <em>be</em> no &quot;better life&quot; for you or your family afterward.  That &quot;better life&quot; would be only for those few 1%ers that TPTB would deem &quot;worthy&quot; of surviving the &quot;alien attack&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re getting just what exactly an ET FF attack means or would implicate.  It effectively involves a few people deciding who lives and who dies - where <em>they</em> are the ones who live and a good percentage of humanity is annihilated.  As I said elsewhere on here, I&#39;m okay with that so long as it&#39;s THE RIGHT BEINGS deciding upon this.  Problem is that I can almost guarantee that it will NOT be the right beings making these types of decisions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As long as the control is taken away. Religion, money, race, they are all control mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My brother, it is an ET FF attack that will in actuality <em>ENSURE</em> that the control on this planet remains stronger than it ever was before.</p>

<p>Think about what the result has been of literally EVERY FF attack that has taken place in this country.  Each and every one has always resulted in not only a continued war of conquest that&#39;s killed millions of people, but in a massive tightening of civil liberties of the population as a whole.</p>

<p>That last and biggest FF attack - the &quot;ET invasion&quot; FF attack - would simply continue this dynamic for those individuals that would remain.</p>

<p>If this is what you&#39;re implying, then this is very, very foolhardy on your or anyone&#39;s part.  It is at best disregarding, and at worst, purely ignorant of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">the vast amount of FF attacks that history has proven TPTB to have perpetrated against the 99%</a>.  Taking into consideration the fact that Black Project technology has been said to be something like a couple of <em>centuries</em> ahead of what is available in the public sector, along with the proven track record of FF attacks in this country, I think it is a <em>very</em> prudent thing to at least be aware of the possibility of something like a FF ET attack taking place and not be simply ignorant of that possibility and then get blindsided by the total and abject fear that TPTB would then use to further control the population with if an attack somehow <em>did</em> indeed happen.</p>

Make sure, however, that you are objective and critical (and strong) enough to simply go where the evidence points you regardless of how much you yourself might not want to go there or how much the MSM and/or those around you might tell you that that direction is wrong or that you <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> &quot;go there&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I feel that if people see ships in the news and sky and they&#39;re real, there&#39;s no real reason why the people will necessarily assume that it is, therefore, a government FF and would, thereby, become more afraid of the government.</p>

<p>People may not even think that it&#39;s a government FF - as many I think are still ignorant and in the dark with regard to just how nefarious and manipulative TPTB are in this world - and if they did, I can tell you right now that I personally WOULDN&#39;T be more afraid of the government.  If I found out it was indeed a FF, I would be MUCH more likely than ever before to raise arms and literally fight, go to war, and be unafraid to die battling the government.  I wouldn&#39;t be afraid.  I would <em>fight</em>, and I don&#39;t think I am alone or unique in feeling this way or being willing to do this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you fear the government then they can maintain power, even if they have to be a villain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  I <em>absolutely</em> don&#39;t agree with this.  The 99% already pretty much <em>know</em> that the government is not on their/our side.  We already know that TPTB are pretty much against us.  However, if an invasion took place and it was indubitably and unambiguously known that it was EARTH&#39;S own government that was doing this shit and <em>not</em> some ETs?</p>

<p>No way, man.  Fuck that.  I absolutely KNOW that I wouldn&#39;t be alone in totally rising up, banding together with other people, and simply fighting, fighting, fighting against TPTB.</p>

<p>I know I am not alone in this feeling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention, WHY PUBLISH ARTICLES REINFORCING THE IDEA OF A FAKE ALIEN INVASION? If you wanted people to believe it, you would do the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this is a good point.  I have to admit that this crossed my mind, and presented a vexing dilemma of sorts.  Why indeed would the broadcasting of even the <em>idea</em> of a fake alien invasion take place if an ET FF was indeed what TPTB were planning on?  If they were really planning on it, then it would seem - like the 911 attacks - they would just <em>do</em> it without necessarily warning anyone about it months in advance so as to maximize on the level of surprise and confuse the population even more.</p>

<p>I would not be all too surprised by this.  There is so much secrecy and disinformation that it is <em>very</em> difficult to assess just what data is accurate.  It seems ongoing research that understands and is ready for the fact that the information can change from one month to the next is, perhaps, the best way to go.</p>

<p>I mean if this was a benevolent alien race and the government used this as disinformation people would be horrified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it <em>was</em> a benevolent off world race, then I&#39;m not certain that the Earth&#39;s government would be too capable of keeping them from imparting whatever message they wished to impart in whatever manner they wished to impart it.  I&#39;m not certain TPTB <em>could</em> keep an off world race from contacting us - individually or collectively - if that race was so inclined.</p>

<p>As such, I do not feel that the people would necessarily be &quot;terrified&quot; if TPTB tried to take off world contact and twist it into something designed to scare the 99%.  While I think that many very well may get scared, I am not convinced that I myself would - and, again, I do not count myself as being all that much different than the rest of the Earth humans here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, what can you do if you think someone is inside your head? How can you rebel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Focus and work diligently at not allowing whatever possible fear you may feel to keep you from concentrating.  Control your mind and your thoughts.  Understand the interconnectedness of existence and connect with that aspect of your Greater Self that works above and beyond whatever manipulating force, entity, or influence you feel might be inside your head.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Project Bluebeam targeted Christians because if alien&#39;s did arrive all the Christians would be in complete denial. They would all say FF. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I mentioned somewhere else in this thread, they likely wouldn&#39;t say FF when they start getting vaporized left and right.  Nobody thought 911 was a false flag <em>initially</em>.  Why?  Because people were dying, dropping from hundreds of feet in the air, and buildings were getting blown up before everyone&#39;s very eyes.</p>

<p>You can be a Christian in complete denial, but if your mom or dad, or brother or sister get killed right in front of your eyes, you might pretty much start to freak the fuck out.</p>

<p>They&#39;d be too busy crying and gasping for help from TPTB to think about the fact that TPTB are actually the ones DOING it.</p>

<p>&quot;Dr Henry Kissinger is said to have spoken at the 1991 Bilderberg meeting in France about how “an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated,” would cause the “peoples of the world” to “plead to deliver them from evil.” Kissinger continued:</p>

<p>“The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario [of an outside threat from beyond], individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.”&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm.  Seems like an interesting article, but I&#39;m not quite sure what the correlation is between TPTB using ETs as a possible FF and human beings finding out and becoming comfortable with the fact that there, in fact, <em>are</em> ETs existing in the first place.</p>

<p>I mean, of course, one supposition <em>could</em> lead to the other, but it seems to me that it might be too big of a stretch to suppose that just because many humans might be coming around to the fact that there <em>is</em> indeed sentient, technologically advanced extraterrestrial life in the cosmos that at least <em>some</em> of those beings are, therefore, interested in coming down here to Earth and fucking us up.</p>

<p>One, of course, does not necessarily have to lead to the other.  Matter of fact, any ET race that has the technological capability of visiting this planet is in all likelihood NOT hostile.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I think even a FF attack by a supposed &quot;ET life form&quot; would, in the long run, be beneficial to society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what Paul Krugman theorized, and I am personally in stark opposition to this because, while it can be said that there are indeed too many people on this planet, and the majority of those people are, as it were, &quot;useless eaters&quot;, I also think that any other human individual or group that has taken it upon themselves to deem who exactly should and should not be spared has a lot more power than they deserve, than they are worthy of having, and than they <em>should</em> have.</p>

<p>I would in no way be afraid to be one of the many considered &quot;expendable&quot; and end up dying at the hands of some human consortium of decision makers if it meant that humanity indeed would end up thriving, living correctly, and doing right to one another and the planet.  However, given the fact that it indubitably seems that the same entities that seem interested in culling the population to the extent they propose are also the <em>same</em> entities that are, for the most part, actually RUINING and <em>KILLING</em> the fucking planet...I would say that <em>these</em> individuals in particular are in <em>NO</em> position whatsoever to call any shots with regard to deeming who should stay and who should go.</p>

<p>In short, I agree that killing off a good portion of the human population would be a good thing...but only if 1) it indeed was what the planet needed in order to better itself (something that has not been indubitably proven, as it has been said that if we lived with much better and more efficient technologies, then the planet would be able to healthily and cleanly sustain an even <em>greater</em> population than currently exists), and 2) if those who would be in charge of the killing were indeed greatly spiritually and technologically advanced human beings that WOULD end up bettering the world after everyone is gone.  However - and again - neither of these suppositions seem to be the case.  As such, therefore - and even though I am in no way all too afraid to die (I actually wish for it oftentime) - I would not personally be willing to relegate the decision as to whether I stay or go to an individual or individuals that I do not see as being any better, smarter, or more spiritually advanced than I or really anybody else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would help deconstruct the nation-state view point and religious view points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could ABSOLUTELY be done in a near heart beat without having to kill off a large percentage of the population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hopefully making us realize we are all one humanity and to stop fucking with each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this could absolutely be infused in the people of Earth without having to resort to killing the majority of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>however it could back fire and they could just implement some terrible NWO type shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not only the main point behind my initial statements, but is also what I can almost guarantee would absolutely happen.  This is the very reason why I feel that a FF ET attack would not - in the short run or the long run - be anything but the most diabolical of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an honest question about libertarian ideology, and your statement brings up the best preface I&#39;ve seen for it.  Please understand, I&#39;m not trying to be snarky or imply anything in the least.  I honestly want to know.</p>

<p>Libertarians seem to be really motivated by the freedom to be self-reliant.  Hard work, doing your best, and being aptly rewarded are the hallmarks.  Those are easy to get behind, for sure.</p>

<p>But, history has shown that when someone works really, really hard and makes one dollar, someone somewhere makes 100 off of it.  Currently, libertarians would posit that the government is the beneficiary.  In the past, it was the business owners.  Sure, previously, you could go off grid and carve a life out of the wilderness, or take a risk and build a business yourself.  However, currently, there are so many barriers to both and people spending 100&#39;s of millions to keep those barriers, and their power, in place.</p>

<p>Hard work and reward, the way the system has developed, will only benefit either the government or the private corporate class.  It, too, has become a replacement for slavery, and libertarians are advocating that we, as citizens, do it harder and better for our own benefit.  That doesn&#39;t make sense to me at all.</p>

<p>If you really value freedom, how can you advocate for the freedom to work hard for someone else&#39;s profit?  If that&#39;s not the case, do libertarians not realize the monumental global paradigm shift that&#39;s required to make the self-reliance and self-interest thing actually happen?  Do you think it&#39;s really as simple as deregulating a few things here and dropping taxes by 5%?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I evolved into a libertarian once I began working for myself back in the early 90&#39;s. I was already &quot;there&quot; on maximum personal freedoms and minimal government intervention. I never felt like a conservative/ republican or a liberal/ democrat. Both sides seemed to only have some of the answers. I have come to realize it makes almost no difference at all.</p>

<p>I wish I could avoid the government taking their &quot;pound of flesh&quot; from me; however, that does not seem possible, right now. I do not mind paying tax; however, I do not like getting screwed by incompetent government intervention at local, provincial (state) and federal levels. Even though I pay a lot of taxes, I get a lot of value for my money because many of my life expenses come out of my business as an expense (IE: vehicles, meals, cell, etc.), rather than a draw off my income (which is taxable). For example, my wife is an ICU RN with 25 years experience and she &quot;nets&quot; less than I do. In Canada, it is about what you keep, not what you make.  </p>

<p>I believe strongly in small business and entrepreneurial pursuits. It has been proven time and again that these are the best economic engines for Canada (my country) and I would bet the same is true for most Western nations.   </p>

<p>The people need to unanimously realize this.  This much is certainly true.  I would like to think that it&#39;s possible for this to happen withOUT there having to be a &quot;shock&quot;...but the masses <em>are</em> indeed pretty brainwashed, so it might not be easy to finally wake everyone up to the fact that we are controlled.</p>

<p>Of course WE don&#39;t.  We aren&#39;t the ones that would plan it. lol.  It&#39;s been said, however, that now that the public is really starting to wake up to the 1%&#39;s nefarious machinations and FF attacks, TPTB are going to have to do something really &quot;different&quot; in order to fool the people this time.  A simple bombing or terrorist attack won&#39;t work.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">That&#39;s already been done and played out</a>, and the public might not fall for it again.  Therefore, &quot;Bring in the aliens!&quot; it is said.</p>

<p>In this manner, your &quot;we don&#39;t need a fuckin&#39; alien invasion&quot; comment is a bit misplaced and not understanding of where the core of the <em>reasoning</em> for such an attack would come from.  It wouldn&#39;t come from us.  It would come from the upper echelons of TPTB.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is only true to a certain extent.  While it does indeed seem true that the majority of the world&#39;s population still walks around ignorant of the gravity of the situation, I would say that the OWS movement has none the less began waking at least <em>some</em> people up that were previously ignorant of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>What this is simply not understanding or accounting for is the fact that there is a sizable consortium of influence on this planet interested in making sure that many people stay destitute and poor regardless of what kind of hard work they do.  Rewarding hard work and keeping the government out of our pockets and minds DOES indeed motivate citizens for the better...but 1) I think this reward system is exceedingly rare on this planet, and 2) I do not think it is any accident that it is this rare.  I think it is purposefully contrived to be this way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PS: Aliens are as invalid as religion ... both are tools of fear to control the sheep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that a good percentage of your statements are both very correct, yet, somehow and at the same time, entirely ignorant of the bigger picture.  The existence of extraterrestrial beings is an absolute truth.  <a href="http://brumac.8k.com/Briefing/Briefing.html">Their visitation upon this planet is also a voluminously documented fact</a>.  Additionally, your blanket statement against religion is also extremely narrow-sighted.  Much of religion should indeed be looked upon in a critical manner.  This is true.  Not all of it, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>both are tools of fear to control the sheep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not disagree with this.  However, this does not mean that the tools that are being used to control the sheep 1) are not actual <em>realities</em> (because they are realities), and 2) are not themselves tools that can be used not for control, but to help further develop the minds and perspectives of the beings using them (both human and otherwise).</p>

<p>Today, religion flies planes into buildings and has outlived it&#39;s shelf life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  It&#39;s not religion that does that as much as countries and governments intent upon conquering other people.  Don&#39;t blame religion for improprieties against a government intent upon another country&#39;s destruction.  This is to say that while I agree that religion as it is practiced on this planet does indeed seem to generally be more trouble than it&#39;s at this point worth, a <em>very</em> strong argument can be made showing that Islam itself had little to do with 911.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think if we were being visited by aliens who have conquered the time/ space technology challenges we would have been vapourized and our heads would be dangling from the rear view mirrors on their spaceships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whaaat?  This statement assumes from the onset that any off-world race would <em>necessarily</em> be interested in conquering this planet.  Why on Earth would you ever assume something like that?  This could be no further from the truth in terms of what necessarily <em>has</em> to happen.</p>

<p>If they were interested in overtaking this planet, it would present little difficulty, but it is not fair to assume that they would be interested in doing any such thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at how humans with guns deal with humans with sticks and stones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what?  Humans are for the most part primitive idiots.  Don&#39;t apply these traits to a race you already admitted would be far more advanced than we.  This is a human characteristic that need not necessarily apply to an off-world race at all.</p>

<p>Agreed.  Absolutely.</p>

<p>Although I would not disagree that planes are flown into buildings in the name of religions, make very sure that you really understand <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article28542.htm">just which religion is the one most likely doing it</a>.</p>

<p>Think about what you&#39;re saying here.  This very statement outright assumes that any extraterrestrial race that would visit would <em>necessarily</em> come here to conquer us.  This could not be any further from the truth.  Thinking this way is about as far from the truth as you can get actually.  While it is not fair to say that &quot;every&quot; ET race would be benevolent toward Earth humans, assuming that they would necessarily attack if they came here is not in any way accurate at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do not go applying the remedial idiosyncrasies of a race as primitive as ours to what an ET race much more advanced would do.  It does not necessarily correlate in the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  It&#39;s just something that sticks out to me because a lot of people try to debunk the idea of ETs having visited us (something I&#39;m not convinced has happened) by saying:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I evolved into a libertarian once I began working for myself back in the early 90&#39;s. I was already &quot;there&quot; on maximum personal freedoms and minimal government intervention. I never felt like a conservative/ republican or a liberal/ democrat. Both sides seemed to only have some of the answers. I have come to realize it makes almost no difference at all.</p>

<p>I wish I could avoid the government taking their &quot;pound of flesh&quot; from me; however, that does not seem possible, right now. I do not mind paying tax; however, I do not like getting screwed by incompetent government intervention at local, provincial (state) and federal levels. Even though I pay a lot of taxes, I get a lot of value for my money because many of my life expenses come out of my business as an expense (IE: vehicles, meals, cell, etc.), rather than a draw off my income (which is taxable). For example, my wife is an ICU RN with 25 years experience and she &quot;nets&quot; less than I do. In Canada, it is about what you keep, not what you make.  </p>

<p>I believe strongly in small business and entrepreneurial pursuits. It has been proven time and again that these are the best economic engines for Canada (my country) and I would bet the same is true for most Western nations.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Therefore, work toward being critical and intelligent and <em>obtaining</em> those facts.  Make sure, however, that you are objective and critical (and strong) enough to simply go where the evidence points you regardless of how much you yourself might not want to go there or how much the MSM and/or those around you might tell you that that direction is wrong or that you <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> &quot;go there&quot;.</p>

<p>Some find that if the evidence points in a direction that they find uncomfortable, they either discontinue and stop searching, or uncritically try to rationalize an alternative explanation that is not in keeping with the trend and information.</p>

<p>Again, really uncovering the information requires one to be strong - very strong - and realize that it might reveal some possibly very uncomfortable and unpopular things about the planet we live on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Manhattan who is the worlds only superhuman informs him that nothing ever ends. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was he being portentous? i.e. warning against the possible, unending negative ramifications that staging something like this could be responsible for?  While I imagine that he may have not been, I think that the negative ramifications of a FF attack might be <em>more</em> likely to occur than &quot;world peace&quot;, as all <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">previous attacks that later showed themselves to likely have been FFs</a> did nothing but tightened the control of freedom from masses more so than had been the case before, almost always resulted in the conquest of more land, and always, always left a sizable toll of <em>many</em> people dead in their wake.</p>

<p>As I said elsewhere in this thread, not only do I NOT feel to any extent that the staging of a FF is the only option for bringing people together, but the truth of the matter is that I personally would actually have no problem with the sacrificing of a large portion of humanity for the sake of the betterment of the planet (even if that means that I myself would be one of the many casualties) if this sacrifice were being conducted <em>by the right beings and for the right reasons</em>.</p>

<p>The big problem with this is that those that would carry out such a FF would more likely be individuals that have already shown themselves to be more intent upon world conquest in the name of the perpetuation of money, power, and greed than it would be any sort of enlightened, evolved beings.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to sacrifice myself at the behest of an obviously greater, much more evolved being for the sake of the betterment of the planet and the race.  However, I am NOT willing to do so for the sake of a small group of piece of shit money hoarders that have already raped the planet and the humans on it of much of their worth.</p>
