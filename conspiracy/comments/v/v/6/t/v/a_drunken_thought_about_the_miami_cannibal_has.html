        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last night while drinking with friends and discussing current events, a discussion about the Miami Cannibal came up. Primarily that it was concluded that Rudy Eugene was not on Bath Salts, but only had weed in his system. </p>

<p>As I said in the title, this is my first time coming to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. So I&#39;m unsure if this theory was thought up by anyone else, but I was thinking...</p>

<p>What if the findings were faked and falsified in order to help give politicians a reason to counter pushes for marijuana legalization? Say Eugene was in fact on other drugs, but some government official/agency/body pushed for Weed to be named as the only thing in his system. This would be done in the hope that it would cause somewhat of a panic, or give a reason and something to cite for politicians to oppose marijuana legalization? </p>

<p>I understand this might be a stupid theory due to quite a few holes, but it&#39;s what I came up being half drunk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he gnawed on his face to the point of bleeding? He bit pieces off and spit it out? Eugene saw something attack the man&#39;s face, he scared it off and started giving the man CPR, in a desperate attempt to save his life, it was just a coincidence that he was naked, he chose to go save the man immediately rather than putting on clothes first. The cops actually shot a good Samaritan and are covering it up? Sounds plausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking that this guy probably did have THC in his blood, like so many other people, but that it is completely irrelevant to his apparent mental breakdown. 
Considering that THC stays in your system for something like two weeks (sometimes more) after last smoking/eating/vaping/whatever, them finding it in his blood isn&#39;t really a big shocker, and it&#39;s actually not at all an indication that he was under the influence at the time of the attack. </p>
