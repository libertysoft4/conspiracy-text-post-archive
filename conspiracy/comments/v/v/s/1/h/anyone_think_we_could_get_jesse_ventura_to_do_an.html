    <div class="md"><p>Jesse Ventura seems like a really cool guy, it&#39;d be great if he could do an AMA. But, I think that he&#39;d get a lot of flack from the &quot;mainstream reddit users&quot; I guess you&#39;d say. I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time defending him on various threads. A few weeks ago someone posted a picture of Jesse from the movie Predator with a quote from his character and most of the posters said negative things about him like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Too bad &quot;The Body&quot; is also a conspiracy theorist whack-job.</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that&#39;s the way many people treat anyone who mentions something which could be considered a conspiracy theory, it doesn&#39;t matter if someone is a veteran of a foreign war, former governor, and successful author because once you&#39;re associated with &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; then the mainstream will label you as crazy. I was bringing it up because on the threads that I&#39;ve seen that mention Jesse there has been a lot of hostility toward him. Most of the comments are childish in nature, but the fact of the matter is he is being demonized not only for his beliefs, but also for not wanting airport security to molest him everytime he gets on a plane since he has a metal implant in his leg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ve read plenty about silver and it is amazing.  When you get very small angstrom size particles of silver in your body it keeps viruses in check.  There are places in your body like your joints where there is little to no cellular immune system.  The silver particulars destroy the virus and bacteria upon contact.  I think that it is important as hell but certainly only piece of a larger health solution.  Now does the Silver Lungs generator produce these small particles?  I have no idea.</p>

<p>Also there was this guy who very famously turned a shade of silver by taking silver.  He routinely fucked himself by putting salt into the solution with the electrodes and that Chlorine - I believe bonded with the silver and did a bad one on him.  You are just not supposed to do that.  I&#39;ve seen a few quick videos of him and he just looks like a really neurotic guy to me so that is just cemented into the heads of older people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that taking in it through the lungs is more efficient than using the digestive system.  That silver is making its way all through your internal body fluids and it should prevent you from ever having an outbreak of mouth herpes (cold sores).  It works like this because the silver will go into your spine where the viruses hide and it will continually zap them away and so the virus numbers will remain very low.  Its really a shame that people who have had outbreaks of genital herpes are taking these awful medicines when they could just be doing what you are doing and they would have zero negative side effects with a whole bunch of other positive side effects.</p>

<p>Hey so you should check out Mother Earth Minerals.  They have a book called <em>Wellness Secrets for Life</em>.  In this book I learned about silver, zinc and copper being the second stage of the immune system.  First stage is your body pH, second stage is the metals and the third stage is the cellular immune system.  The ultra basic Western medicine system teaches virtually nothing about the first two lines of defense and so they make it out as though white blood cells (T cells ... for HIV/AIDS people) are the end all be all of immunity.</p>

<p>So this company is run by a defrocked doctor who was ignorantly going about healing people instead of just giving them pills.  So I believe now he can help people lose weight but he can&#39;t cure the disease of obesity as a doctor if you get my meaning.  So everything is a disease and only doctors can treat diseases with drugs and surgeries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is overly dramatic that is for sure but that is just because he is a Texan.  If you take out 80% of his flare it makes sense.  So I bought a very small amount of coal stock a few years ago and it has been way down.  There were Obama trades being broadcast and they all about &quot;alternative&quot; energy.  I followed them and although I didn&#39;t put money into them they were pure money makers.  That seems to me to be just a given at this point.  Are you not aware of carbon credits, Kyoto Protocol and all of that?  This is not new.  America is being repositioned for better or worse to use its immense natural gas reserves and coal use is being hit hard.  Crazy.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones won&#39;t be taken seriously. There&#39;s been too many incorrect theories, scams and just plain bullshit to come out of his mouth for him to even dare make AmA.</p>

<p>I think Jesse Ventura could be a guy that might change Reddits views on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, instead of &quot;THAT&#39;S STUPID, YOU SHOULD X/POST TO R/CONSPIRACY LUL, AMIRITE GUISE?&quot;. Jesse Ventura is a good writer, a great journalist and never starts preaching like some sort of profit. He simply wishes for people to open up their minds to reality where everything that they&#39;ve been spoonfed to believe by the media, may in fact, not be true. Which is partly why I like him so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the people who stand to gain the most from it are behind the AGW scam. They needed a revenue stream, so they mounted a propaganda campaign to demonize a harmless and indeed essential gas, carbon dioxide. They charge people a penalty for generating carbon dioxide -- well, life generates carbon dioxide, and also uses it. It&#39;s part of our biology. The more CO2 in the air, the more vigorous the growth of crops that we need to feed ourselves. More CO2 means more food. I can&#39;t put it more simply than that, yet the con artists who run the man-made global warming scam have turned it into some sort of poison in the minds of the sheeple (and I can&#39;t think of another word for those who believe in AGW, unless maybe retards).</p>

<p>Then I stumbled upon the The Club of Rome and the <a href="http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html">Green Agenda</a></p>

<p>&quot;In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill...All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to get taken in, if you are accustomed to bowing before scientific &quot;authority&quot; and if you lack common sense ... and I&#39;m sorry to say that common sense is sadly lacking today. People don&#39;t use their own minds to make independent decisions any more, they rely on &quot;experts&quot; to tell them what to believe (just as the peasants of the Middle Ages relied on the priests of the Roman Catholic Church to tell them what to believe). But if you start to actually look at the contrary data, the whole AGW scenario falls apart and is revealed for the cynical money and power grab it always was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, you can patently and blindly sit there, without looking at the evidence I&#39;ve presented before you -- and snidely continue to regurgitate the exact same talking point you&#39;ve heard from every news source, talking head in the business while knowing that the majority of &quot;mainstream&quot; people will agree with you (and if you find comfort in social reinforcements and groupthink then you might just do that) </p>

<p>Or you could SHUT THE FUCK UP for like 30 minutes, go through the links -- maybe even do your own research to see if it is possible that powerful globalist actors have been able to influence the public discourse and even force scientists (while promising them massive funding if they do so, or study anything that mentions &quot;global warming&quot;) to create fraudulent data (like the hockey stick <a href="http://www.john-daly.com/hockey/hockey.htm">graph</a>) so as to further a global agenda. </p>

<p>That is hilarious. Why is it then, that Newsmax was able to report in 2002, under the titled article: Enron Gave Big Bucks to Democrats, <strong>Backed &#39;Global Warming&#39; Scam</strong></p>

<p>&quot;During a White House meeting in July 1997, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay prodded Clinton and Gore to support a &quot;market-based&quot; approach to what he described as the problem of &quot;global warming,&quot; <strong>a theory discredited by a majority of the world&#39;s climatologists.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Without any kind of massive scientific uproar?!?</p>

<p>For the record I support curbing pollution because I&#39;m an environmentalist and a true conservative (as in I&#39;d like to conserve our natural resources) and I hate the oligarchical oil companies that direct the trajectory of US foreign policy as it fits their profit margins -- I&#39;d love to see alternative energies.</p>
