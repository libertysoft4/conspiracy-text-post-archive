        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has there been a 100% conclusive verdict reached by reputable researches that even mentioning &quot;9/11 might have been an inside job&quot; is a silly and misinformed thing to say? Or is it because people are sensitive abut this issue and don&#39;t want to talk about it?</p>

<p>I remember watching a &#39;film&#39; called Loose Change, about half a decade back which addressed this issue. To me, their logic sounded reasonable and it caused me to lean towards calling conspiracy. If the film I watched was an incredibly misinformed one, I would like to know how some of the arguments from it are overthrown.</p>

<p>I always yearn to know the truth and be rational about everything, so I was hoping you people could shed some light on this matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edited for extra truthiness:</p>

<p>What you say is horrible for the reason that the case was never opened.</p>

<p>19 &quot;already-guilty&quot; conspirators on Day and practically Hour One does not a case shut, it opens the vital question of how their identities (and that of their ringleader, never mind connection to Iraq) were found so quickly yet their actions responded to so slowly -- if at all. The 9/11 Commission failed at this and has admitted so.</p>

<p>That the same individuals authored (more or less fraudulent) reports on behalf of different government agencies exhibits a conflict of interests, just to incompletely dissuade any suspicion of demolition or planning, is grounds for &quot;appeal&quot; when no such theory was even considered in order to be legitimately ruled out by evidence-based logic, witness testimony, or otherwise. Why don&#39;t you even READ the reports that shut your so-called case?</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been the coordinated, comprehensive, public investigation of internal affairs your comment indicates. It&#39;s ridiculous that this must be argued half-point by half-point to brain-dead American consumers of television who also readily accept the explanation for why the economy is tanking. That&#39;s where we need to start. Hint: it&#39;s because tanks are expensive.</p>

<p>Extra hint: The War on Terror is a fraud. Get that through your skulls, people, before the bullets do.</p>

<p>Just what court case are you anti-truthers imagining?</p>

<p>Honestly, if someone links to anything remotely legitimate, and not just a random youtube vid, they get an upvote from me for contributing and providing something close to evidence.  If someone just throws out wild claims without any reasonable evidence to support, its bullshit and hurts the quality of the subreddit, so it gets downvotes.</p>

<p>To be clear, I don&#39;t downvote just because someone cannot prove a point beyond a doubt, only if claims are made without support.</p>

<p>If you did some looking and listening to simple videos on youtube....you&#39;d hear explosions....you&#39;re see FREE FALL SPEEDS.</p>

<p>You need someone to tell you because you don&#39;t want to do the thinking or you don;t have the capacity to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a certain amount of knee-jerk downvoting. In a perfect world it wouldn&#39;t happen, but there are so many trolls and saviors attacking us &quot;truthers&quot; and sabotaging the threads it is understandable that some develop a hair trigger response.</p>

<p>Also a lot of the time the people &quot;asking&quot; for information have a history of making comments ranging from condescending to extremely insulting. It doesn&#39;t take long for people to realize that an abusive poster itsn&#39;t likely to add to the conversation and downvote to reduce the noise. </p>

<p>You&#39;re fairly abrasive yourself and defend outright abusive posters, in my opinion you&#39;re getting downvoted partially for that reason. If you look through the threads there are plenty of examples of people asking for information with no downvotes. </p>

<p>The other reason is you did not ask for information, you demand evidence that meets your standards and you were unpleasant about it. No one here owes you anything and we don&#39;t care if the information we choose to consider doesn&#39;t meet your standards. </p>

<p>Many of us do not agree on which conspiracies are valid and in the case of 911 have varying views of the events and who is responsible. You are free to have your own view and as long as you don&#39;t try to force your view on the rest of us or demean our opinions, I don&#39;t think there would be a lot of downvotes. Just my opinion of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to go much farther than accepting the fact that the majority of the 911 commissioners said the commission was flawed.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the co chairs of the 911 commission saying it was set up to fail:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzrv-e37Es8">Thomas Kean</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnANe7w8pmY">Lee Hamilton</a></p>

<p>Add the fact that they were not allowed to follow the money trail and you can form a conclusion.</p>

<p>How were some guys in a cave in Afghanistan able to defeat the New York requirement to test for explosives in suspicious cases, especially since there was a similar attempt to destroy the WTC on February 26, 1993?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html?sub=new">The 9/11 Commission&#39;s co-chairs said that the 9/11 Commissioners knew that military officials misrepresented the facts to the Commission, and the Commission considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements</a> (free subscription required)</p>

<p>9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070108233707/http://www.cbc.ca/sunday/911hamilton.html">&quot;I don&#39;t believe for a minute we got everything right&quot;, that the Commission was set up to fail, that people should keep asking questions about 9/11, and that the 9/11 debate should continue</a></p>

<p>9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/02/9-11panel.pentagon/index.html">&quot;We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting&quot;</a></p>

<p>9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/11/21/cleland/index.html?pn=1">&quot;It is a national scandal&quot;</a>; <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/13/911_panel_to_get_access_to_withheld_data/">&quot;This investigation is now compromised&quot;</a>; and <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/23/the_white_house_has_played_cover">&quot;One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up&quot;</a></p>

<p>9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that &quot;There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . . We didn&#39;t have access . . . .&quot; He also said that <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2009/03/13/the-9-11-commission-and-torture.html">the investigation depended too heavily on the accounts of Al Qaeda detainees who were physically coerced into talking</a></p>

<p>And the Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (John Farmer) - who led the 9/11 staff&#39;s inquiry - recently <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/senior-counsel-to-911-commission-at.html">said</a> &quot;At some level of the government, at some point in time...there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened&quot;. He also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html">said</a> &quot;I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described .... The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years.... This is not spin. This is not true.&quot; And he <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1921659,00.html">said</a>: &quot;It&#39;s almost a culture of concealment, for lack of a better word. There were interviews made at the FAA&#39;s New York center the night of 9/11 and those tapes were destroyed. The CIA tapes of the interrogations were destroyed. The story of 9/11 itself, to put it mildly, was distorted and was completely different from the way things happened&quot; </p>

Died on 911
Recorded January 25, 2001 (44 seconds)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EREolpI1G4w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EREolpI1G4w</a></p>

<p>This video of David Ray Griffin is one of the first videos that started making people think twice about the events surrounding 911:</p>

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3538037502590699697">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3538037502590699697</a></p>

<p>Once you realize that the commission was flawed, you have to consider that the truth was not all reveled. </p>

<p>At that point, you realize that it is incredible that anyone who agrees that the 911 commission was compromised for whatever reason, would not support a new independent investigation of the biggest massacre in America since the federal government massacred the Indians? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to be a little more critical.  What would you think of someone if they told you something in conversation that you know is completely untrue?  Either they are a liar or they are incompetent.  Now look at NIST and the 9/11 commission.  Anytime members are confronted with questions that deal with reports of explosions, they act flabbergasted and act as if they are hearing about such a thing for the very first time.  Anyone who watched the events unfold that day with a decent memory can clearly remember multiple reports of explosions.  Anyone who&#39;s watched replays of the events, such as those aired on MSNBC on the 9/11 anniversaries, clearly heard about explosions.  And anyone who&#39;s watches clips on the internet hear clear and multiple examples of first responders reporting explosions.</p>

<p>So why are these investigators so clueless?  There must be only two explanations, either they are incompetent in doing their job, OR they are blatantly lying.  So which is it, and what makes you more comfortable when these are the people who are constantly cited as the &quot;final say&quot; in what happened that day?  </p>

<p>The least people can ask for is a general recognition of the obvious, which is the NIST report is a crock and possibly a white wash.  It is so obvious, that people may confront others with a slight bit of patronization because to them, others who don&#39;t see it are clearly in some sort of denial, or lack the simple skills necessary to see through what most may perceive as &quot;bullshit.&quot;</p>

If it is the truth you seek, the truth you shall find. Just be ready for it. Most people are not and hence their defence mechanism kicks in at the slightest hint of &#39;inside job&#39; talk. The big picture becomes very clear when you use 9/11 as your spring board. One thing leads to another and i warn you- the deeper you go the harder it is to turn back. Open your mind and try to use uncontaminated critical thinking. We have all been conditioned since birth so look at your search as a quest to de-program and see things for what they really are.

    <div class="md"><p>I think I have an answer to your question.</p>

<p>There is no majority of people who read this subreddit or any other. That &quot;majority&quot; is so disinterested in following through on fact-based research that they skip to other people&#39;s conclusions, with or without that kind of thorough background, instead, because they don&#39;t have any affiliation to/familiarity with any related subject or field of interest when they&#39;re going through Reddit comments and voting on posts. They also identify themselves with the majority they imagine themselves to be defending. They want to find as many conclusions as possible to support whatever theory was prominent in that majority mind before they visit the sub, unless of course they&#39;re like you and me, because of speed and efficiency.</p>

<p>Then when they show up and find that this stuff takes time and god-forbid patience to unearth and work out for oneself to undo that colossal fraud we reasonable conspiracy folks see every day, it&#39;s much faster and easier to label/file it away as crackpot/kook theory if it does so much as peel away at their solidly constructed reserves of fantasy. Truth and rationality aren&#39;t selling points, they&#39;re foundational and are easily overlooked, and hard to prove they&#39;re hiding under there.</p>

<p>In r/conspiracy 9/11 truth is not downvoted at all (ie hijackers still alive got about 100 votes the other day).  In other /r/&#39;s it is mostly because the points advanced by 9/11 truthers are ridiculous (wait and see some gems to this post..free fall...silverstien...thermite paint).  Truthers will tell you its cause the rest of reddit are sheep, and afraid of the truth, but the fact is many have read all the arguments and determined for themselves that the majority of &#39;truther&#39; points are simply misinformed and wilfully ignorant of reality.</p>

<p>WTC1 and 2 came down in about 10-11 seconds.  Do some simple math.  Divide the floors by those seconds and how many floors do you get per second?  LOTS.  Whatever number you come up with.......is free fall speeds.</p>

<p>Perhaps you forgot your question to me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does Free fall speeds mean to you? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me: Free fall in a vacuum, any object with mass will accelerate at 9.8m/s² to ~56m/s terminal velocity.</p>

<p>So why the &quot;what the hell are you talking about?&quot;  Did you forget what you asked me? </p>

<p>You claim there was no resistance.   There was observable evidence that this is not the case.  There was initial resistance at the top when the first of the floors began buckling. Once momentum built up, there would be little to nothing to resist the mass times the acceleration. </p>

<p>So to recap:</p>

<p>Your claim:  ZOMG they fell at freefall speeds! I don&#39;t know what it means but something isn&#39;t right!</p>

<p>The actual:     There was measurable resistance initially(by seismic activity and other ways) , then much less so once the momentum built up.  That doesn&#39;t mean there was any violation of physics or some grand explosion that made it that way.  You&#39;re simply extrapolating that to fit your viewpoint.   </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">WIKI</a></p>

<p>So if I shove you into your buddy......when you tow collide, do you both accelerate because you hit each other??  No.</p>

<p>His standing mass SLOWS YOU DOWN.  </p>

<p>So when the buildings don&#39;t slow down and continue to accelerate, that means all the mass (building structure) below it was no longer there to RESIST the initial fall or collapse.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I think 7 may have been pulled, it was already damaged from the fallen buildings and had multiple explosions /fires going for 6-7 hours.  I think if it was pulled, the support structures at bottom were taken out and the building imploded. Not much resistance there.  Near free fall would be standard.      </p>

<p>The negligible resistance in WTC 1 and 2 was observable by the material being launched outward.  Once the first 2-5-10-18-24 floors were on their way down, inertia increased with the mass. Another aspect to it is that, from the impact of the planes, the core support structures were also damaged, not there entirely on certain floors, or i&#39;m sure &quot;some&quot; were untouched and began bearing the load of the missing/damaged ones.  This extra load built tension into the structure, so that when the floors finally caved above the impact area, it started a chain reaction downward. There was just no where near the resistance it would take to withstand 10, then 20, then 30, then 40 falling floors&#39; inertia.  Some of the energy expelled debris outward, but most was directed downward via gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST already admitted that the damage to the building was not a factor in that.  Sorry, you can&#39;t use that excuse any more.</p>

<p>Inertia increaed sure, but not because it JOINED with any other material to create some sort of crushing energy.  That&#39;s not how it works.  You&#39;re making this up from your imagination man!  That video shows it exactly, its the same thing as a &quot;building being pulled&quot; just as you said.</p>

<p>That smaller bit does not have the ability to crush the rest of the building beneath it, not because it has inertia.  Not because it &quot;gained&quot; inertia.  It WOULD slow down had it impacted anything.</p>

<p>Just as you say, material was spewed out the sides, but you don&#39;t think about HOW that is possible?  Fire does have the energy to do that, and just because the building starts its collapse, doesn&#39;t mean it suddenly has magical powers to toss crap out and into the buildings next to them.</p>

<p>Listen, one last point.  The building was constructed in three sections.  The bottom being the strongest as it had to carry the heaviest load.  The middle was build just like that, in the middle of the road.  The top was the lightest with technically, the least amount of &quot;strength&quot;, and therefor, the least amount of material.</p>

<p>With that knowledge, I don&#39;t think even you can deny that the smallest and least amount of material could pummel its way through the bottom two stronger sections of untouched building.  </p>

<p>What you&#39;re describing is not possible.  It cannot build inertia as it goes through material.  As you admit, material was tossed out the sides.  The cause of that is explosives.  These are beams that weight tons, and concrete that is held together by millions of rivets and then welded together.  An acre in size.  Tonnes of material.  </p>

<p>It cannot and does not just spew stuff because part of the building falls off the top.  You&#39;ve seen the footage.  The one where it slips to the side looks like its going over, but as soon as it emerges from the dust, the top had turned to rubble!  What caused that?  The top should be pristine until it hits the ground.</p>

<p>So falling floors and materials that come in contact with more material wouldn&#39;t build mass and eject some out all sides?  That is impossible?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and just because the building starts its collapse, doesn&#39;t mean it suddenly has magical powers to toss crap out and into the buildings next to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To clarify, this is for 1 and 2, not for 7.   The footage indicates this exactly, from every angle, from every report.  This is precisely what led to 7 even getting damaged. The buildings did not just fall exactly into their footprint, they had specific diameters of material/damage.  This is not really debatable, so please explain why you feel a building is, when falling, not able to &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;magically&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; toss material out on all sides. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think even you can deny that the smallest and least amount of material could pummel its way through the bottom two stronger sections of untouched building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the core structures of both towers were severely damaged, the reinforcement of the lower floors (not debating that) was no match for the falling mass/inertia.  Most of the middle/bottom floors were subjected to the falling mass, and had nothing that could withstand that amount of force.  Could there have been a longer delay on the way down?  Maybe, but the sheer size of the buildings, combined with the amount of mass that began falling proved to be too much for any of the lower floors/support structures to withstand.   Keep in mind, that when they both fell, there were support structures at the bottom still standing, just not the floors themselves.  </p>

<p>and finally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What you&#39;re describing is not possible. It cannot build inertia as it goes through material. As you admit, material was tossed out the sides. The cause of that is explosives.

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The top should be pristine until it hits the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You nearly hit the head on the nail here.   Tons of material, tons of concrete, and beams that weighed tons.   They were no match (no matter how may rivets!hehe) for the mass/inertia that was brought upon them on the way down.  The top was impossible to retain shape as it slammed into material below, causing more material to spew out of the sides.   You claim it is not possible, but that is exactly what happened. You could at least claim it is improbable, and that more buildings of the same size need to be brought down for further testing, but to you, with no valid research, metrics, or math behind it, it is impossible. </p>

<p>So you have me a little confused.  As far as I can tell this is just some guy.  I don&#39;t think his website is anything claimed to be scientific in nature but maybe you can go ahead and just fill me in on that.  Either way, you let me know what he is actually saying in these quotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The steps involved:<br/>
initial collapse, then initial resistance, then further (total)collapse at <strong>near</strong> free fall speeds.  </p>

<p>Did you even read that article? Sure, take it with a grain of salt, but don&#39;t deny it completely by claiming confusion or contradiction.  It doesn&#39;t contradict itself. It says there was an initial collapse (near free fall speeds, it never says AT free fall speeds....) then initial resisitance (verrrry brief resistance.. almost disappointingly so)  then again back to NEAR free fall speeds.  Nowhere in NIST  or that article or any article is there a claim AT freefall speeds.  You can not simply drop 1 ton, 2 tons, however may tons of concrete and steel, onto anything that will provide &quot;seconds&quot; of pause during the fall.  The weight/mass of the object falling generates x amount of inertia to be transfered to the matter below. Beyond all of this, everyone hops on the &quot;pancake theory&quot;, but the floors didn&#39;t fall uniformly at nearly any part of the collapse. The internal support structures  were damaged and began buckling before the floors collapsed.  It is just that it &quot;appears&quot; the floors fell on each other, when internally that was not the case.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if you got a scientific report on lab analysis of soil and particle matter found at the site, you would understand its implications?  That&#39;s my problem with all this proof stuff, how many of us can actually use science to prove any data we see?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why you&#39;re here.  You require a black and white answer.</p>

<p>If you did some looking and listening to simple videos on youtube....you&#39;d hear explosions....you&#39;re see FREE FALL SPEEDS.</p>

<p>You need someone to tell you because you don&#39;t want to do the thinking or you don;t have the capacity to understand.</p>

<p>Free fall speeds should make you say &quot;wtf&quot; and then the desire to be SURE you haven&#39;t been LIED to all this time should kick in. </p>

<p>The consequences of being LIED to all this time and finding out about it, and exacting judgment on the real perpetrators is BETTER than going your whole life denying it and waking up in 25 years and realizing you basically SUPPORTED the whole thing by ignoring it.</p>
