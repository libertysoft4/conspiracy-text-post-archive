        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, i for one am sick and tired all the bullshit going on in the world or involving politics these days. No one seems to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d9deu/couldnt_we_simplify_all_this_conspiracy_stuff_and/">pay attention to, or even know the simple fact</a> that private corporations known as <strong>central banks</strong> or <strong>Federal reserve</strong> just create money as they please and lend it with a <strong>interest</strong>. All the money is lent from them and all nations and people within are in debt to them. This group of people have all the power in the world. This is so inherently wrong and the root of all problems, yet people just don&#39;t seem to be conscious about the fact or talking about it. Not that that people are stupid. But the subject just is just is not publicly talked about in media or anywhere else. All the politics and news these days are just bullshit diversion to keep you distracted about this issue. Ofcource they own the media and do their best not to inform you any of the important issues. The last thing they want is for people to become conscious of this huge scam. I find this all very frustrating and i am more than willing to take some kind of action to make any kind of change. </p>

<p>The one place i recon we could at least try to make a difference is here in the Internets. In reddit. Where, at-least for now i think, everyone is free to speak their opinion. What im proposing is for some kind of group effort to change general conscious. I am calling for all of us here willing to participate, to start pushing information in relevant subreddits (<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, world news etc.) considering the issue. Post all the most relevant information about world banks, FED and the scam that is fractional reserve banking. And to do it often enough for people to really start noticing. Lets try to make people really start thinking about this. Now i know there are lots people whose view cannot be changed in spite of what kind of information you will present to them. For some the mere idea of scam of this magnitude is too much to comprehend and they will refuse to acknowledge it no matter what. But there are lots of people who will see beyond the lies and are willing to accept the truth. They just don&#39;t know it yet. It is up to us to show them. </p>

<p>And i am in no way trying to provoke anyone to start spamming 24/7. Thats not relevant to anyone&#39;s interest. I want for people to start collectively to spread information about this scam so we could get as much people informed as possible. Everyone should support each other and start <strong>upvoting</strong> these posts as much as possible. I want us all to work for the same goal which is to get as much people as possible informed and conscious about <strong>Federal reserve, world banks and the scam they are pulling. They are creating money as they please and lending it. They do not have the right to do so. No private corporation or group of people should have the right to do so. It is too much power in wrong hands.</strong> This should be known by everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/10/081010_everything_is_a_lie.shtml">Now, know that there are much disinformation and counterintelligence out there surrounding this subject</a>, and everything else for that matter. And know that economics, banking and whatnot can be tricky and complicated issue to talk about. But just don&#39;t let all the jargon distract neither you or others. After all, what we are talking about here is pretty simple concepts, the bare basics. The power to create money and lend it with interest.</p>

<p>And what comes to the subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">disinformation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-intelligence">counterintelligence</a>, there will be lot of attacking coming from users who are trained very well in aforementioned arts of communication. They do this for work and are bought and paid for. Dont let these fucking cockroaches distract you either. These sneaky rat fucks have sold their souls to the devil and do whatever it takes to smear you, debunk everything and twist the truth to confuse and distract. They try to keep everything in grey area and hard to comprehend. They will outright lie to keep people from understanding. They will try to associate the truth with irrelevant information. They try to make the truth seem like a stupid conspiracy and link it with other deliberately ridiculous conspiracies. They will even link to this article and say &quot;see, its all just a bunch of conspiracy theorists with their conspiracies&quot;. Their disinformation tactics are endless. But the truth is simple. Keep it that way. I am not surprised to see the first comments of this post to be be something judgmenting and demotivational. Smearing this whole post as something utterly ridiculous and disservice to the reddit community. I bet some user will come out in the first comments and invoke authority, with a long and thoughtful explanation of how this is all stupid and pointless. Its all to demotivate you. I&#39;m expecting this post to be downwoted to oblivion because that is what they do. <strong>They&#39;ll try everything from preventing people to come together for the common good</strong>, for the biggest threat for them is for people to unite against them. <strong>They are the underdog here</strong>. It is just a matter of us people realizing common cause and uniting against the real evil.
<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/10/081010_everything_is_a_lie.shtml">Relevant</a>, as posted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d2jdo/everything_is_a_lie_the_deliberate_intent_to/">aqua7</a></p>

<p>So let&#39;s try to get some real information to peoples consciousness and try to make some kind of change together. Let&#39;s really start pushing information here about world banks and their deprivation of the world. Lets try to get people informed. Upvote and support each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real crime is that they charge interest and yet the money to pay this interest is never created. </p>

<p>Only the principle sums are created in response to a loan request.</p>

<p>Therefore it is  impossible to ever pay off the debt because the money to pay it with does not exist. Debt just keeps mounting until the banks own everything everywhere with practically no work or investment necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Answer to all these problems, is switch from an oil based economy to solar based.</p>

<p>to do this, just become responsible for your house, power, water, and food. These are the things people <strong>need</strong> to stay alive. if you live off grid, it is a lifestyle of abundance. It is nearly <em>impossible</em> to stay in debt in a self sufficient lifestyle.</p>

<p>also, by people doing this, you completely disempower the governments, and empower the people.</p>

<p>for a summary, watch a &#39;permaculture&#39; video online. its basically a compilation of all the worlds best tips and tricks to fix the planet, people, and ones self. (by fixing the environment you live in)</p>

<p>anywho, good luck dudes, we&#39;re all out there saving the planet, and thats one of the best two pieces of advice i could give.</p>

<p>the other... is start a food coop, we are currently running one in Australia thats going very well, (if designed right, you can gain more influence than your own city council with one of these :)
also, we are making it easy to replicate and open source, as we are creating it in Mexico and Edmonton Canada (shortly) </p>

<p>Trust me when i say, 80%+ of the worlds problems root cause is <strong>FOOD</strong>
use this to your advantage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I went to college, naturally one of the subjects I had to take was Economics. I worked all semester on the professor of that class to watch &quot;Money as Debt&quot;.</p>

<p>Ever since they watched it, it has become one of the videos that students watch in that class. </p>

<p>For those who have not watched it, it does say that the money is created on the presses without anything to back its value, the first people who get it (ie banks) will have the greatest purchasing power with that money before the effects of inflation kick in and cause prices to rise, and that the money has to be paid back to the Fed at interest, payable in Federal Reserve notes. </p>

<p>So, essentially, students taking economics under my professor are learning just that. GG</p>

The guy making the movie makes some pretty wild claims at the end which I disagree with, but I have to give him some credit.  He did manage to get former PM Paul Martin, on video, to admit that this IS how our monetary system works, however in Mr martin&#39;s words &quot;(it is not a fraud) because people knew about it when it was created, or they should have anyway&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not really a very good criticism. While he may or may not be right about the source of the quotes, almost everything else is evasion. This is all he has to say about the constitutionality of the Federal Reserve Act:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since when is the Federal Reserve Act unconstitutional?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great detective work there Lou.</p>

<p>Let me try :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall have the power to... coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow yeah. That wasn&#39;t too tough was it? Where does it say that Congress has the right to create a privately held banking system and let a private corporation &quot;regulate the value thereof&quot;? </p>

<p>Right. It doesn&#39;t. And if you know <em>anything</em> about the Constitution, it was very carefully written to control <em>precisely</em> what the Federal government could do. And it specifically says, that if its not here in the Constitution, its not a Federal power.</p>

<p>There ya go. Piece of cake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently the film makers have a very small understanding of the Federal Reserve. Yes, it is a private corporation, however it is not as private as Federal Express. It is considered private because the decisions it makes do not necessarily have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislature. However, the Federal Reserve has a board of governors with seats for congressional officials. The Federal Reserve is also subject to heavy oversight from Congress. Therefore, it is not necessarily private or public, rather it is &quot;independent within the government.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do anything you want as long as there is no law against it.  No right to do something?  That&#39;s pretty backwards since we don&#39;t have a book of legal activities.  We do have books that explain what is illegal.   Congress gave the FED (a private organization) this power.   Nothing illegal.</p>

<p>Aside from that, motivations for what?  I agreed with most of what you said.   The federal reserve is a private organization that prints US dollars based on US Government requests, then gets repaid that money with interest.   You seem to think people would be outraged by this, when in-fact, they are not.   Most people take it a step further and ask - What do we do to fix it?   We can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Let government print what it wants without having to pay anyone back for it or pay interest.   </p></li>
<li><p>Put the US Dollar back on the gold standard.</p></li>

Rather than creating national debt to banks when new money is created and lent out to increase production, we would be creating a national <em>dividend</em> for every new dollar that is loaned out and then paid back.  Instead of a perpetually decreasing of value from our money it would be perpetually(for the most part) increasing in value.  Instead of a country becoming more and more in debt(which is what currently happens, the richer a country is, the more debt it has) it would become wealthier and wealthier and everyone would benefit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, that is not a plan.</p>

<p>We all do that.  There is only so much to post, most of it doesn&#39;t get upvoted for enough people to see, and if you talk about it with people who don&#39;t want to hear abou tit enough they will just write you off completely.</p>

<p>&quot;making lots of noise&quot; is not any type of plan, and is not going to &#39;make it happen.&#39;  no offense but in order for me to get excited we need a better strategy than simply saying true things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment but I have a question for you. For years I&#39;ve been listening to people saying spread the message, let people know what&#39;s going on. How many people need to be informed before we make change, and what needs to be done once enough are informed? Even if 50% of the public are with us, what are going to do, storm the white house?? I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate here because I think we have enough supporters (sure more is better), but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a real plan for change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the major crux of the problem.  What <em>do</em> we do.  A single country can not change things, if they tried it would be economic suicide.  Example:</p>

<p>Country - &quot;Fuck you banks, we&#39;re taking back our economy&quot;</p>

<p>IMF - &quot;Hey country, you might want to re-think this.  If you take our power away here, then we will exercise it elsewhere.  You know that dollar of yours?  Guess what, we&#39;re the people who rate it.  Give us our power back or your dollar is going to be worth less than a penny US, worldwide&quot;</p>

<p>Now what?  </p>

<p>Our only chance would be to try and create some sort of revolution worldwide, to eliminate the World Bank, IMF and all the central banks in all the major countries.  The solution to this problem we are in, whatever it is, is going to be very difficult to implement.  It has to be a global thing, AND it requires us to rethink all of our economic theory and monetary systems.  If you were to suddenly shut down the Fed or whatever central bank we are talking about, what happens to all the dollars still out there?  What about foreign investment?  Who&#39;s going to rate peoples money?  How will we calculate exchange rates?  Etc etc etc.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, telling people and getting them to believe you is the easy part.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dollar won&#39;t be worth a shilling in a couple of years anyway. The Federal Reserve will pass China late next year as the largest holder of American Debt. That&#39;s my guess anyway. The Fed has already &quot;monetized the debt&quot; to the tune of 850+ billion, and is on track to monetize another 1.2 trillion in the next year. Its a great scam. Create money, buy your own debt, then charge interest to the American people. These people need to be in a Turkish prison.</p>

<p>And its not as bleak as you paint it. The Treasury can print dollars as well as the Federal Reserve. Anyone who wanted to change the Federal Reserve Dollars into US Treasury dollars could certainly do so. Only we would no longer be paying interest every second of every day for the privilege of borrowing our own money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shhhh shh shh. Go to back to sleep. We all know this is happening and we accept it.... and so will you....soon enough. Just breath deep and count to 10..... Better?</p>

<p>Now. Let me ask you. What happens next? What should we do different now that you have realized things happen (continue to happen) that are too big for you (or I, or anyone) as an individuals to change? Do we start launching ships filled with extremophiles that can live on Mars to start turning it into Earth 2? Can we tame a savage planet, and within 5 generations or less, be sending fertile young men and women there to create a planet that lives in peace?</p>

<p>I would like that too. </p>

<p>Or, should we climb to the top of a tower with a rifle and a manifesto pinned to our shirts? March for change? March for war? You and I are very much the same. We can see the chaos over exertion of control leads to. Money controlled by too few, who look at humanity by the masses, that turn a deaf ear to suffering. It&#39;s just not right. If this is such a great world bank thing we all blindly follow, than why can&#39;t &quot;X&quot; (something I know is wrong and must be changed) be removed from the human condition? </p>

<p>At this point, because age has mellowed emotional treason (my name for it) I can also see Tyler Durden was make believe because he can never be a real person without being worse than what we have.</p>

<p>When it comes to America (I guarantee to anyone reading this that the OP is American) there can no longer be change through violence or rebellion. We&#39;ve seen enough of it. We have been so busy killing since we were born a nation, it&#39;s become necessary to vent at our next door neighbors in order to....i don&#39;t know what. </p>

<p>There&#39;s always young eager bodies willing to continue working/fighting for change where I&#39;m (soon enough, I hope, we&#39;ll be) forced to let go of anger born of injustice and accept that this is the world we live in. </p>

<p>I hope you will let go too. Let&#39;s both hope we don&#39;t have to leave influence to talking heads that are empty of ideas. Let&#39;s hope we can isolate the good things that happen to the living and share the good rather than the bad.</p>

<p>If you would like to join a cause, I suggest you work for the things you both believe in and embody, as well as things you are just a spectator of, and believe in. That last part was my shout out to the ents and prop 19. California is throwing down an enormous domino that may lead to the righting of a wrong.</p>

<p>BTW Do you know what would happen if you won your fight? You&#39;d find emptiness, and look for something else to win...until someone challenges your previous victory. Then the onus is back on you to decide if this is your cross to bear, as they say. And way too often, you&#39;re all in again. Those emotions that carried you to the victory will now work to destroy you. I think I&#39;ve said enough.</p>

<p>TL;DR STFU and pay your taxes Ben Stein... wait what?  </p>

The value of our currency is proportional to the value of the US economy relative to other economies and to the amount of money in circulation. So if we keep printing money with no restrictions then the buying power of an individual dollar drops.</p>

<p>The reason we have a SINGLE agency printing money is because having multiple ones causes all sorts of problems. The biggest one being no co-ordination or regulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, Im not sure if Im going to be able to even read this guys garbage.  From the first page of the article you linked </p>

<p>&quot;In the first movie he attempted to explain monetary policy, but it was very skewed and incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, economics is often viewed with confusion and boredom. Endless streams of financial jargon coupled with intimidating mathematics quickly deters people from attempts at understanding it. However, the fact is, the complexity associated with the financial system is a mere mask, designed to conceal one of the most socially paralyzing structures humanity has ever endured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure if it&#39;s just a &quot;mask&quot; as the film puts it, because like all complex systems, it needs even more complex rules to keep it in place and of course the longer capitalism exists the more complex the system gets. Prior to the labor movement in the 1920s and prior, the financial system was less complicated, but still fairly complex and now it&#39;s far more complex.&quot;</p>

<p>How in the hell does this debunk <em>anything</em>?  How is this an argument <em>for</em> a monetary system that the richer you are the more debt you have?  You want to convince me that these documentaries are sensationalist etc?(Ive never watched Zeigeist btw, but rather Im referring to &quot;money as debt&quot; and others like it&quot;)  Well here&#39;s how.  Please find me a source that shows how a country can get out of debt when every new bill printed is handed out as a loan, or one that shows that this is not what happens when new bills are printed.  Im willing to bet you cant find one.  </p>

<p>But anyway, afaik a country can get out of debt when the budget is balanced, all government bonds etc are paid out and no new ones are issued. I never understood how &quot;Money as Debt&quot;, for example, comes to the conclusion that debt is perpetual. It has a lot of things right but then gets others really wrong:</p>

<p>Does that not mean that no new money is being created then?  Doesnt the economy go into recession when that happens?  </p>

<p>Here is the thing.  Lets say Im a new company.  I want to expand production.  To do so I need more money. So, I go get a loan.  That loan comes from a bank.  That bank got it from a central bank, as a loan, and has to pay interest.  That central bank had the bills printed by the mint, which then sells it to the central bank at cost.  </p>

<p>This is how the monetary supply is increased.  It is decreased when banks stop giving loans and keep collecting on existing ones.  Since every single person in the entire country has to pay back its loans <em>with interest</em>, there is not enough money to pay it all back <em>with interest</em>.  As such, the number of bills in circulation decreases.  People stop spending and start saving.  Recession starts.  </p>

<p>As far as i understood it: the budget of a country and its money supply are not the same.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That assumes that every single person in the country has a loan and didn&#39;t create any surplus value with it. If the whole country bought big screen TV&#39;s there&#39;d be a problem but most loans by far are investments into production or other enterprises. The interest is paid with the profit.</p>

<p>How do they create surplus value?  The thing is that EVERY single dollar in existence in the US right now was printed and distributed as a loan.  There is only so much people can spend, and only so much available to pay back banks with.  The interest doesnt exist unless you take out another loan, which adds more interest.  Our economy is debt based whether people want to acknowledge that or not is their choice.  I would like to ask you though, is there any country on the planet, or better yet, are any of the G7 nations free of debt, in other words, have no national debt to banks?  is there any country that has EVER paid back its national debt, <em>ever</em>?</p>
