    <div class="md"><pre><code> &quot;I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our 
 Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the 
 reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine 
 principles of its Constitution; I mean an additional article, taking 
 from the federal government the power of borrowing. I now deny 
 their power of making paper money or anything else a legal tender. 
 I know that to pay all proper expenses within the year, would, in 
 case of war, be hard on us. But not so hard as ten wars instead of 
 one. For wars would be reduced in that proportion.&quot;

 - Thomas Jefferson in 1798 in a letter to John Taylor

<p>This is exactly why I don&#39;t fault Ron Paul for refusing to get involved with 911 conspiracy stuff. No matter how much evidence you get pointing to their guilt, it will never be enough as long as they have the money printing machines. </p>

<p>There is a difference between tactical victories (winning a 911 argument) and strategic (taking away their money printing apparatus). It is the later that wins the war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know if government being able tp print money is the problem.  the problem is that the government should be able to do it &quot;interest free&quot;.  The problem in my mind arises when the government allows a private corporation to purchase money from the mint, which just prints it, at cost and then said government allows this private bank to &quot;loan&quot; them the money that the government itself created, with interest on top of the added inflation that printing new bills causes.  First the interest doesnt exist in the system, only the principal, so it creates a never ending cycle of debt in order to pay the interest, second it asks for more bills in return then that which was originally printed, meaning more money in the hands of banks and less out there for consumers to spend.  Its like a giant double whammy that the taxpayers get hit with.  </p>

I know damn well that they loan money they dont have, which was given to them by the fed, at minimal interest, the Fed having received it from the mint after only having paid the cost of printing bills.  They make money loaning money they didnt have in the first place and then expect us to pay interest.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, you are the one who started the name calling.  You want a more detailed description of how banks create money from debt, check out the movie &quot;Money as Debt&quot; or if you are Canadian and want to see it from a Canadian perspective and even have the concept confirmed by one of our former PM&#39;s as well as a couple of our other party leaders then check out the &quot;Oh Canada Movie&quot;.  Both can be found by simple google search.  Im pretty sure the first one can be found on google videos as a documentary and the second has its own site, with movies linked to in parts on youtube.  Want a little history on how this situation came to be?  Well then you will see in my other posts in this thread I posted this link <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/19268/Banking-TimeLine">http://www.scribd.com/doc/19268/Banking-TimeLine</a> .

    <div class="md"><p>i realize this, but the government <em>does</em> have the ability to print money and distribute it <em>interest free</em>.  If Im not mistaken, it is the Federal Reserve Act that gives this ability to the Fed, which then distributes the money to other banks, usually at an interest rate.  They then loan that money to people at an even higher interest rate.  Since the start of the recession the Fed has been giving 0 interest or near 0 interest loans to the banks.  The Fed is chaired by owners of banks.  So these owners of banks are having the Fed print money at cost, and then are loaning it to themselves <em>interest free</em>, then loaning it out to the public at a 30%(give or take) interest rate.  The Fed also loans to the government, money it never had before, that it purchased at cost, to the government with <em>interest</em>.  This is the issue I have with the current banking system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Federal Reserve exists solely to allow the US government to avoid the already existing Constitutional restrictions on money.  They set up the Federal Reserve as a private bank, and the money it issues, the Federal Reserve Note, i.e. the current dollar, is a debt between the holder and the Federal Reserve, not the US government.  </p>

<p>So technically the dollars you hold from the Federal Reserve are a contract between you and a private institution, and thus Constitutional restrictions on money, borrowing and taxation do not apply.  Instead the Congress can create legislation that cover these transactions.  Dollars issued by the US government ended in 1971, silver removed from coinage in 1968, and gold currency confiscated in 1933.   </p>

<p>Because of this arrangement, the government is free to exercise enormous control over the public because it can pass laws, not bound by the constitution, over the money issued by the Federal Reserve.  BTW, none of this has really been tested in the courts.  Until the internet came around, most people had no means to understand it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly and up until 1964 we were given an &quot;escape valve&quot; - which is that you could go redeem your paper $1 FRN for silver at any bank (4 quarters, 2 halves, 10 dimes, etc).</p>

<p>This is an interesting (and rarely discussed) issue: Namely, coins come from US Mint, a properly authorized and constitutionally approved full government entity.</p>

<p>So, the debt note you held with the &quot;Federal Reserve, Inc&quot; was in effect backed by the government given that redemption could occur at every bank for proper &quot;US Dollars&quot; (eg. Constitutionally defined as a specific weight of silver). </p>

<p>This provided a facade of legitimacy since in effect there were 2 currencies in circulation with a fixed 1 for 1 exchange rate: Proper US Dollars (silver) and FRN&#39;s (paper). The Federal Reserve was required to ensure this redemption via their commercial banking apparatus (they bought the silver coins from the US Mint at cost) to have available to customers for redemption.</p>

<p>In 1965 all of this changed as silver was removed from circulation - which fundamentally removed &quot;US Dollars&quot; from circulation, leaving only FRN&#39;s now.</p>

<p>An interesting argument one could make (and probably legally sound), is that US Dollars still exist in the form of Silver American Eagles produced by the US Mint (which the Mint gives the value of $1 USD). Its just that the exchange rate is no longer fixed....it is now floating (currently silver is $19.5 so its 19.5 FRN&#39;s to the US Dollar).</p>

<p>The implications of this would be fairly profound. Take your tax liability for instance, you didn&#39;t earn $100,000 US DOLLARS last year....you earned $100K Federal Reserve Notes. Which is only about $5.5K USD, putting you in a vastly lower tax bracket. </p>

<p>Likewise a courts decision that Party A should pay Party B some specified amount of &quot;US Dollars&quot; is in actuality not correct either.</p>

<p>Like you said, much of this has never been tested.....the most interesting test of this was the Kahre case in Las Vegas. In which an employer paid his people in Silver and Gold American Eagles, thereby they could only claim the &quot;face value&quot; of money received. </p>

<p>The IRS couldn&#39;t convict him on the first attempt, but tried 2 or 3 times in various guises and eventually found a jury to convict. Ultimately, the conviction was for some ancillary charge not directly related to this core issue (like he was &quot;hiding assets&quot; by putting them under his girlfriends name). </p>

<p>This brings us to the core issue, which is that it doesn&#39;t matter how constitutional and well-grounded your legal approach is....in the end, a group of criminals are going to steal from you one way or another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed that we need to audit the Fed and put the whole thing before the public, but how is this done when the news media is fully complicit in the deception?</p>

<p>So they issue their report and the Fed is dirty, dirty, dirty.  So what?  Do you seriously believe CNN or The New York Times would give that any coverage?</p>

<p>What about when they issued the 9-11 Commission Report which talked about how resentment over U.S. support for Israeli atrocities against the Palestinian people was the reason we were attacked.  CNN and The New York Times gave that, the most important information there was to have about 9-11 -- why we were attacked -- and kept it from the American public.</p>

<p>Omission is an incredibly powerful tool.  Look at how they recently buried the story about Netanyahu talking about how he killed Oslo.  This is incredibly important news if you&#39;re an American... look at what we&#39;ve spent in trying to make a peace process happen over there, look at what we&#39;ve spent in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Where&#39;s the outrage?  Well, nobody knows about it... how can you be outraged about something you no nothing about?</p>

<p>And so it will be with news that the Fed is thoroughly corrupt.  Nobody will find out.  Except us.  Who already knew, and were already pissed off about it all.  What changes?</p>

<p>So I would just suggest that it is the fact of control over our news media -- and it really doesn&#39;t matter whom you attribute that control to -- that should be central in our efforts, and that it is everything else that is a distraction.  Put out the political officers and bring back journalism and stories like the Fed will arrive of their own virtue.</p>

<p>That the banks, that defense, that big oil are acting the way they do today should surprise nobody.  But the news media?  That&#39;s a failing on a completely different level.</p>

<p>It&#39;s betrayal.</p>

<p>The pen is mightier than the sword, and the body count of the U.S. news media proves this beyond any doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have had wars, large and small, since the beginning of time, everywhere, regardless of the technology. The US establishes a central bank and four years later, WW1. Technology is irrelevant. If we had a central bank in 1850, we would of had a world war with whatever technology we had at the time. Your missing the point of the ability created by printing money, rather then collecting money from the people. Lincoln needed money for the war and it was a problem. The war needed funding in order to take place. That was the point, not technology.</p>

<p>WW1 &amp; WW2 were not caused by having a central bank, they were able to happen because of a central bank. These wars cost a lot of money. They never would of happened if the American people had to pay the bill prior to the war taking place. That sir, is my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your clarifications, and I apologize for being rude. You are apparently well-intentioned, and I will do my best to respond courteously to your claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US establishes a central bank and four years later, WW1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably already know this, but that statement implies nothing by itself. To suggest that there&#39;s a link between the two events is a <em>post hoc</em> fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technology is irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I strongly disagree. The ability to travel quickly and communicate over long distances allows military coordination on much larger scales than could be accomplished otherwise. Additionally, mass production is crucial for supplying the vast numbers of personnel which would be needed to wage global-scale war. I could go on and on about the relevance of technology, but time is limited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we had a central bank in 1850, we would of had a world war with whatever technology we had at the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one can possibly know for certain what would have happened. Besides, Sweden had a central bank in 1664, and they didn&#39;t have a world war. England created a central bank 30 years after that, and they didn&#39;t have a world war either. In general, central banks didn&#39;t become widespread until <em>after</em> World War I.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[WW1 &amp; WW2] were able to happen because of a central bank</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s your evidence that a central bank was the only way the wars could have been paid for?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They never would of happened if the American people had to pay the bill prior to the war taking place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to my research, the primary sources of US financing for both world wars was taxes and war bonds. In other words, the money did come from the people. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1916">Revenue Act of 1916</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_bond">Liberty bond</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_home_front_during_World_War_II">US home front during WWII</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1940">Revenue Act of 1940</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease">Lend Lease</a>.)</p>

<p>Note that many of the US allies had their own central banks. And yet they still borrowed money from the US. That tells me that the ability of a central bank to print money isn&#39;t enough to support a massive war effort.</p>

<p>Also, as I understand, during the Civil War the Confederacy tried printing money to pay their debts. The result was hyperinflation. The money was virtually worthless. The Union, on the other hand, raised its money largely by loans from war bonds and by taxation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1861">Federal Income Tax in 1861</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1862">Revenue Act of 1862</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1864">Revenue Act of 1864</a>). They also printed money, but not nearly as much. The resulting inflation was moderate.</p>

<p>The financing of the Civil War also serves as a reminder that you don&#39;t need a central bank to print money.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m asking is that you explain the relevance of the articles before I take the time to read them.</p>

<p>EDIT: I read the first article. I see no connection between it and the role of central banks during the world wars. There was no mention of central banks. There was no mention of world wars.</p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to think that you can&#39;t explain the relevance of the articles you posted because they&#39;re <em>not</em> relevant. Please correct me if I&#39;m mistaken.</p>

<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see no connection [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet you say you have no pre-existing views.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already made several points which you have shown no interest in exploring on your own; rather, you&#39;ve demanded that I spoon-feed you information you already should have had before entering into this discussion.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Point #1: Quoting a Wikipedia article with reference to any matter remotely relating to Zionist agenda has already been compromised by that agenda (the article you supposedly read).</p></li>
<li><p>Point #2: Tying the aforementioned compromise to the longer, broader history of compromises which are contained in the Zionist agenda. (Because you made assertions of knowing your history.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Point #3: (Again, because you made assertions of knowing your history.) Laying out and identifying the direct historical parallel to the history of the Rothschild family (if this hasn&#39;t made a connection to central banks and their roles in world wars, then it is YOU, fellow redditor, who is without question in possession of pre-existing views, no matter how vocally you may assert to the contrary).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Point #4: You are coming across as a blathering hypocrite in the way you leap from one side of the online debate strategem to the other: always demanding more of your fellow conversants than you&#39;re willing to contribute in your vacuous rants.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Read the information. Once you&#39;ve read (yes, it&#39;s a lot. but, likewise, yes, it&#39;s relevant), we&#39;ll have something to discuss. Until then, you&#39;re just high volume line noise in my mailbox.</p>

Complacent might not be the right word. But the idea that normal necessary things  are exploited for out labor, and compounded with interests. Its a viscous cycle that if you want to be apart of the system you have to abide by the rules, cause that is the game. As deplorable as it is to the entire human race.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t automatically downvote me-- it is super lame how the bury squad of conspiracy theorists won&#39;t let any alternate views be seen.</p>

<p>I am a liberal who believes that the Federal Reserve serves vital roles in our system. Let me start by pointing out many programs that are similar to the Reserve that liberals do embrace. For instance, Freddie and Fannie intervene in markets in ways that favor wide-spread home-ownership. The new Secretary of Health position will be able to dictate price levels, earnings allowances, and competitor entries within the health care sector. The Social Security program specifically plans to use its authority to shortchange some contributors in favor of maintaining solvency.</p>

<p>Of course I am not against any of these programs. Nor am I against the Federal Reserve. Providing a strong controller for our financial system is common sense. It is also a widespread practice, except in Somalia. Facilitating credit transactions and manipulating the money supply is as much &quot;selling out to the banks&quot; as expanding health care is &quot;selling out to the hospitals&quot;. Grow up wingnuts, Obama and the rest of we level-headed liberals are tired of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine. Keep the Federal Reserve. But how&#39;s about letting us audit the books? Or let us count the gold that&#39;s <em>supposed</em> to be in Fort Knox? </p>

<p>If  you&#39;re willing to pay trillions of dollars to people for their amazing  oversight ability, how&#39;s about we get to audit them occasionally?</p>

<p>And if they&#39;re so good at oversight, how come they were just about the last people to see that the housing market had to crash eventually?</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t the overseer assume some responsibility for their lack of oversight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like we have a sharp difference in perspective. In my opinion, your overall view is discolored by the fact that you don&#39;t understand the value of financial markets. Your perception of financial issues comes from seeing only the pop-culture elements of the marketplace that are broadcast in the news. </p>

<p>If you are just re-stating the mantra of &quot;government accountability&quot; than I don&#39;t know why you are so upset. The federal reserve is only as corrupt as any city council, and is not some grand &quot;blank&quot;-order conspiracy.</p>

<p>On the issue of an audit: I and the general public obviously cannot oppose the principle behind an audit. That idea is foolish on its face. Do not expect a normal procedure to apply to the FR. Many parties are constantly angling for oversight of FR actions, and this shouldn&#39;t be misinterpreted as a fight to keep malicious information sealed. </p>

<p>Your painting: &quot;[we pay them] trillions of dollars&quot;</p>

<h2>My perspective: The governors and head of the FR are not very highly paid. These people are intelligent and experienced and could make more money in the private sector. I assume you are also trying to mis-characterize the other money that is &quot;given&quot; to the FR.</h2>

<p>Your painting: &quot;they were just about the last people to see that the housing market had to crash eventually.&quot;</p>

<h2>My perspective: These people have financial sector backgrounds and understand our system as well as anyone in the world. Politics played a role in delaying our action on housing. In fact, an unopposed reserve would have been much more proactive.</h2>

<p>I have addressed your comments and questions with some substantiation and in a straight-forward manner. I did not dodge any of your major points. You owe me the respect of not downvoting my original post so that I can be heard and constructively discuss my views with everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like TexasMojo said you don&#39;t mention anything about transparency.  That is the problem with main stream financial janitor-mechanics like yourself.  You learn how to operate the dials and levers and you are taught only a small subset of the economic knowledge.  Read John Perkins.  You were taught what you know to further justify the exploitive system and to help process loans on either a micro or macro scale.  Nothing more.</p>

<p>from the Death Gate Cycle:</p>

<p>The Kicksey-winsey, a grand machine intended to align the floating continents and provide them with water (water being a direct byproduct of its production cycle), as well as manufacture all the processed goods desired by the other worlds, never became properly active. The dwarves, also known as Gegs, not truly understanding its purpose, effectively became slaves to the machine, worshipping it after a fashion as an artifact of their gods (the Sartan) who had placed them there as its caretakers.</p>

<p>That is how I see you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah whatever, I have other majors. Do you all support abolishing fannie and freddie, because they interfere with the housing market? What about abolishing the new health care reform provisions that put the Secretary of Health unilaterally in charge of major decisions? Is it that you don&#39;t understand capitalism, or is it that you just cherry-pick topics you don&#39;t really understand, to shout about them? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get rid of any of these programs, and I especially don&#39;t want to get rid of the Federal Reserve.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly and up until 1964 we were given an &quot;escape valve&quot; - which is that you could go redeem your paper $1 FRN for silver at any bank (4 quarters, 2 halves, 10 dimes, etc).</p>

<p>This is an interesting (and rarely discussed) issue: Namely, coins come from US Mint, a properly authorized and constitutionally approved full government entity.</p>

<p>So, the debt note you held with the &quot;Federal Reserve, Inc&quot; was in effect backed by the government given that redemption could occur at every bank for proper &quot;US Dollars&quot; (eg. Constitutionally defined as a specific weight of silver). </p>

<p>This provided a facade of legitimacy since in effect there were 2 currencies in circulation with a fixed 1 for 1 exchange rate: Proper US Dollars (silver) and FRN&#39;s (paper). The Federal Reserve was required to ensure this redemption via their commercial banking apparatus (they bought the silver coins from the US Mint at cost) to have available to customers for redemption.</p>

<p>In 1965 all of this changed as silver was removed from circulation - which fundamentally removed &quot;US Dollars&quot; from circulation, leaving only FRN&#39;s now.</p>

<p>An interesting argument one could make (and probably legally sound), is that US Dollars still exist in the form of Silver American Eagles produced by the US Mint (which the Mint gives the value of $1 USD). Its just that the exchange rate is no longer fixed....it is now floating (currently silver is $19.5 so its 19.5 FRN&#39;s to the US Dollar).</p>

<p>The implications of this would be fairly profound. Take your tax liability for instance, you didn&#39;t earn $100,000 US DOLLARS last year....you earned $100K Federal Reserve Notes. Which is only about $5.5K USD, putting you in a vastly lower tax bracket. </p>

<p>Likewise a courts decision that Party A should pay Party B some specified amount of &quot;US Dollars&quot; is in actuality not correct either.</p>

<p>Like you said, much of this has never been tested.....the most interesting test of this was the Kahre case in Las Vegas. In which an employer paid his people in Silver and Gold American Eagles, thereby they could only claim the &quot;face value&quot; of money received. </p>

<p>The IRS couldn&#39;t convict him on the first attempt, but tried 2 or 3 times in various guises and eventually found a jury to convict. Ultimately, the conviction was for some ancillary charge not directly related to this core issue (like he was &quot;hiding assets&quot; by putting them under his girlfriends name). </p>

<p>This brings us to the core issue, which is that it doesn&#39;t matter how constitutional and well-grounded your legal approach is....in the end, a group of criminals are going to steal from you one way or another. </p>
