And if any one of those ~20 had chosen to come forward at the time, the entire event would have been prevented. But no one did come forward. Everyone had a personal incentive to enable it. (Silverstein got a couple $ Billion in insurance money. Cheney and Wolfowitz got their wars. Etc.)  </p>

<p><strong>An &quot;inside job&quot; means simply:  Someone on the inside is <em>critically</em> required for the plan to work.</strong>  In the case of 9/11, about 20 American &quot;insiders&quot; (including members of the White House) were required before &quot;the grand plan&quot; could even get off the ground).  The rest were foreign agents (Mossad, primarily), or were simply given and following justifiable orders).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was an outsourced job, planned in the Mid 90&#39;s with pre approval and tactical support from many western governments.</p>

<p>The group responsible has been operating for the last century and wont be stopped. They use order out of chaos through false flag terrorism to implement pre determined solutions.</p>

<p>They own the media, they own the money systems, they own both Punch and Judy in the two party puppet shows you call democracy.</p>

<p>Only the serfs think &quot;borders and countries&quot; when the reality is all the countries are corporations trading under the UCC.</p>

<p>Most people will never work it out and they have been taught to use the words conspiracy theory when ever anyone points out what is going on.</p>

<p>..............................................................................</p>

<p>The following book will fill in some earlier blanks on the whom why and how</p>

<p>Some extremely credible resources to learn the true history of the how, who and when this came to be by Professor Carroll Quigley who was asked to act as historian for this secret group.</p>

<p>From 1941 until 1969, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilisations. According to the obituary in the Washington Star after his death, many alumni of Georgetown School of Foreign Service asserted that this was &quot;the most influential course in their undergraduate careers&quot; and he revealed all in his books.</p>

<p>&quot;I know of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Carroll Quigley</p>

<p>&quot;The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole... Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world&#39;s money&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Carroll Quigley</p>

<p>...............................................................................</p>

<p>The deception will continue for one reason only - The apathy of the american public who have been indoctrinated by the mockingbird media on all things global.</p>

<p>U.S. Congressional Record February 9, 1917, page 2947</p>

<p>Mr. CALLAWAY: “In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States&quot;.</p>

<p>Mr. CALLAWAY: “These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers&quot;.</p>

<p>In the Late 40&#39;/50s after WW2 the CIA was created and took over the media</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;as_q=operation+mockingbird&amp;amp;as_epq=&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=100&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=images">Operation MOCKINGBIRD</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CIA begins recruiting American news organisations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA&#39;s media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA&#39;s own admission, at least 25 organisations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CIA ran it for 30 years in house, it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 companies, and the dissemination and disinformation continues.</p>

<p>Whatever they say is taken to the water cooler and made gospel by many people who just don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>.....And 75 Years later</p>

<p>&#39;We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practised in past centuries.&quot;</p>

<p>June 5, 1991, Bilderberger meeting in Baden Baden, Germany - DAVID ROCKEFELLER</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way. I think hundreds of people knew, if not thousands. People <em>have</em> come forward. There was that US Congressman that said the thing was 20 years in the making. A whole plethora of people seemed to know it was going to go down that morning. Everybody doubts their ability to shut up and/or keep people quiet about it. I don&#39;t. You think you just get included in that little group easily? Because you don&#39;t. Why <em>would</em> they come forward? Because we want them to? Because we expect them to? That&#39;s not the way it works. It&#39;s a hierarchy of hierarchies and only the top of the top gets in. I just happen to think a good amount of people were in on it. It had to take lots and lots of people to execute that plan, not 20.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;ve got the right line of thinking, it would have taken thousands of people to remain complacent and not ask questions but the 20 number is right, In fact it could be even less, I&#39;m talking the people in the upper crust of the upper circles who actually know shit, only about 20 people could know exactly what happened that day, not just bits and pieces, but the whole plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there would be a hierarchy of individuals within the conspiracy, but the &quot;thousands of people&quot; would not have just &quot;remained complacent and not asked questions&quot;. They were directly involved and knew exactly what they were doing because it needed to be executed with precision. So they had more knowledge of the plan than you give them credit for. I think at least hundreds knew the whole plan.</p>

<p>What&#39;s so &quot;random&quot; about that? And don&#39;t give me &quot;fires have never before or since destroyed a steel skyscraper.&quot; So fucking what?

<p>And don&#39;t give me the &quot;footprint&quot; BS. That&#39;s how buildings fall. No skyscraper has ever hinged in the middle and bent like nunchucks. These things are not solid. They fall apart instead of bending over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct.  But &quot;weakened&quot; steel still provides an immense amount of resistance.  A building supported by weakened steel will eventually collapse... but WTC1, WTC2 and WTC7 all collapsed at near freefall (i.e., resistance-free) speeds.  (This is indisputable.  Not only is video footage available for everyone to independently evaluate and confirm, but the NIST has admitted to the &quot;free fall&quot; events.)</p>

<p>Free fall speeds can only occur if the entire building (not just a few floors, but the ENTIRE building) is deprived of ALL structural integrity.  Weakened steel still provides a tremendous amount of integrity / resistance.  And to suggest that fire weakened all of the steel through-out each floor of each buildings is just wrong.  (Not even the NIST makes that claim.)</p>

<p>Bottom Line:  Fires did exist on most of the floors.  Fires surely weakened some of the steel framing (in any one of the three buildings).  But in no case was the entire steel structure &quot;weakened&quot; to the point of zero resistance so as to enable a near-free-fall event (which occurred in all three buildings).</p>

<p>Focus on the speed at which the buildings collapsed.  NIST claims ~11 seconds for each of the Trade Towers.  That&#39;s 110 stories in 11 seconds.  (Try clapping your hands together 110 times in 11 seconds.)  Yea... that&#39;s fucking fast.  (And the speed of collapse remained constant -- never &quot;slowing&quot;, which would have been the natural course as te building began to collapse through it&#39;s own core -- meeting more and more resistance every step of the way.)  Resistance would slow-down the collapse over time.  Never slowing means zero resistance.</p>

<p>Anyone with a basic high-school physics class has the knowledge to conclude that all three buildings were demolished.  (Yes, it&#39;s that obvious.)</p>

The jet from a shaped charge will penetrate it, but cutting requires multiple charges or linear-shaped charges. Nickel-molybdenum steel shafts can be cut with a diamond charge. However, the saddle charge will not cut nickel-molybdenum shafts. Therefore, use some method other than explosives to cut nickel-molybdenum steel, such as <strong>thermite</strong> or acetylene or electrical cutting tools.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  When trees collapse, do they pulverize straight down through their own core?  Or do they tip to the side (and follow &quot;the path of least resistance&quot;)?</p>

<p>Collapsing down through one&#39;s own core structure (no matter how strong or weak that structure may be) is to follow the path of greatest resistance.  All three buildings followed the path of greatest resistance -- collapsing straight down and through their own core structure.  This alone, is an entirely &quot;unnatural&quot; event.</p>

<p>Further, by following the path of greatest resistance, it would have been necessary to see a gradual (but measurable) slowing of collapse (as the collapse encountered more and more resistance -- floor by floor).  But none of the three buildings demonstrated a &quot;slowing&quot; of collapse.  At one more, Building 7 displayed an ACCELERATION!!  (This is simply impossible without an outside force providing some assistance.)  But in all cases, there was never any slowing... rather, all three collapses maintained a rather steady speed --- which was near free fall -- itself impossible unless the building&#39;s were deprived of all structural integrity -- not just &quot;weakened steel&quot;, but 100% of the building&#39;s structural integrity must be removed for these speeds to have been achieved.  There is just no way around this -- it&#39;s physics 101.</p>

<p>At free fall acceleration, starting from zero, the building will fall about 30 m or 100 ft.  That&#39;s about eight floors of WTC7.</p>

<p>Free fall acceleration is defined as acceleration without resistance.  That means, those eight floors had to disappear for the building to fall at that rate.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the truth.  There&#39;s no other way to explain it.  Eight floors had to move out of the way in zero time.</p>

<p>Look at the building plans.  There were seventy-seven columns connected to each other on each floor.  This is a huge grid of steel.  It just disappeared.  It was all there, and then it was all not there in very little time.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter what preceded the freefall.  You have to get eight-plus floors out of the way in no time.  They have to give less resistance than air.  They do not account for that.  They simply say it happens.</p>

<p>You are not referencing the report.  You are referencing [slide 64 from this briefing](wtc.nist.gov/media/WTC7RevisedTechnicalBriefing111908.pdf).</p>

<p>So, clearly, they just say free fall happens.  They do not ever explain how it happens.</p>

<p>And, the briefing is a farce.  They say on the very same page you quote from, &quot;[t]he actual time for the north face to descend 18 stories, based on video evidence, was approximately 5.4 s and the computed free fall time was 3.9 s.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a video from David Chandler, who if famous for forcing NIST to admin the free fall collapse.  It&#39;s a two minute video.  It proves that statement from NIST is a flat lie.</p>

<p>If you are serious, as you say you are, then you have to respond to that video in a honest way.</p>

<p>Answer me one question!  Is NIST telling the truth when they say &quot;[t]he actual time for the north face to descend 18 stories, based on video evidence, was approximately 5.4 s and the computed free fall time was 3.9 s?&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the video:</p>

<p>The response to David Chandler is that his video isn&#39;t showing the entire collapse and thus is not proving that the statement from NIST is a flat lie:</p>

<p>Now, if you want to go on claiming there was a controlled demolition, then you have to respond to the fact that there is no evidence that the controlled demolition took place. There&#39;s no sound in any audio tracks and it doesn&#39;t show up on any seismograph readings around the time of the collapse.</p>

<p>Yes, I believe NIST was telling the truth. Based on video evidence, it looks like it took 5.4s to collapse 18 stories, which is in fact longer than the free fall time. If you had actually bothered to watch the links I sent, you&#39;d see this is in fact the case.</p>

Engine 94 - 18 years</p>

<p>Boyle: ...on the north and east side of 7 it didn’t look like there was any damage at all, but then you looked on the south side of 7 there had to be a hole 20 stories tall in the building, with fire on several floors. Debris was falling down on the building and it didn’t look good.</p>

<p>Firehouse: When you looked at the south side, how close were you to the base of that side?</p>

<p>Boyle: I was standing right next to the building, probably right next to it.</p>

<p>Firehouse: When you had fire on the 20 floors, was it in one window or many?</p>

<p>Boyle: There was a huge gaping hole and it was scattered throughout there. It was a huge hole. I would say it was probably about a third of it, right in the middle of it. And so after Visconti came down and said nobody goes in 7, we said all right, we’ll head back to the command post. We lost touch with him. I never saw him again that day.</p>

<p>The support beams are heated to the point of failure. They can no longer hold up the weight of the building. They collapse. The whole structure starts to break apart because there is literally nothing supporting it. So yes, it &quot;free falls&quot; because there&#39;s nothing there to hold it up. </p>

<p>So yes, it&#39;s as if all support disappeared in an instant because that&#39;s what happened. When you heat metal, there are discreet quanta that it goes through at very specific temperatures. Experiments with heating metal are literally the historical basis of quantum mechanics. At a certain temperature (an exact temperature) the columns buckled and the structure turned to dust.

<blockquote>
<p>How did no one notice unusual workers bringing explosives into the building during the days or weeks before 9/11?</p>

<p>People did.  There were power downs.  The elevators were taken out of commission for a week at a time.  And, much of the building was empty.</p>

Those guys had access to multiple floors, they took pictures of them, and the walls were bare.</p>

<p>How did the CIA recruit suicide pilots?</p>

<p>They fly planes by remote control.  The ability is well documented, and the practice is common today.</p>

<p>WTC7 collapsing because of fire is not possible.  In fact, it is impossible.</p>

<p>A false flag attack makes plenty of sense and cents.  First of all, it is possible.  That is to say, it is not impossible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are people that had means, motive, and opportunity.  Means, motive, and opportunity do not exist for the group blamed by the 9/11 Commission, but it does exist for a few state governments.</p>

<p>But, there are plenty of people with the means, motive, and opportunity.  To start, the owner of the three towers, large construction groups with close ties to the bin Laden&#39;s, and people being investigated by the tenants of WTC7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest proof to me that there is much more to the story then the official report is the lack of known evidence.  Such as with the Pentagon, one of the most secure and monitored buildings in the world.  One that also has multiple batteries of missiles along side thousands of cameras.</p>

<p>No video, other than the poor resolution, grainy few still images were ever shown to the public.  There were traffic cameras that captured the entire incident.  Strangely, these were down.  In addition, many other video feeds were taken shortly after the impact, and never included in the official report.</p>

<p>Tell me why that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what I&#39;m saying is that when proof is withheld, there is only ONE reason why.</p>

<p>You seem to think that FOIA requests are granted.  The videos in question did capture the impact, however the release has been denied for &quot;national security.&quot;</p>

<p>We saw no plane impact the pentagon or debris.  We also watched the reinforced command center collapse on 9/11 from fires, though it looked identical to an implosion.</p>

<p>The burden of proof lies with the official report.  And when critical facts are found to have been omitted, it&#39;s pretty easy to understand why.</p>

<p>The debris did not fall.  They were projected.  What accounts for the energy to project a steel beam across a block?</p>

<p>Gravity would push the beam down, but if gravity was the only force, the buildings would still be standing, because they would not collapse through the path of most resistance.</p>

<p>Not so surprising when you consider that US flight security sucks balls. It&#39;s a joke. And simultaneous hijackings really threw the system for a loop. Simultaneous hijackings made the plan <em>more</em> likely to succeed. </p>

One only need to compare Israeli security with US security to see how much the US sucks. I&#39;m shocked 9/11 hasn&#39;t happened a dozen more times since. But I guess they accomplished what they needed to accomplish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main problem with 9/11 being a false flag? It&#39;s the most elaborate and deadly false flag the US government has ever pulled. In the past (tonkin, possibly pearl harbor, cuba, possibly the Israeli attack) the false flag targets were military. Why would they go to such trouble? Thousands of civilians? Aircraft destroyed? The Pentagon damaged? The White House almost damaged? It&#39;s way overboard and unnecessary. (The Pentagon attacked itself? Yeah right.) Plus there&#39;s absolutely no evidence it was a false flag other than the physics look fishy, which isn&#39;t much of an argument in a situation that has no comparison. </p>

<p>Look at the identity of the terrorists. The FBI was investigating one. There&#39;s little chance these guys were US assets. It&#39;s possible the CIA allowed it to happen Pearl Harbor style, but that&#39;s giving them too much credit. It has become apparent in recent years that the US intelligence community is almost completely incompetent. I doubt they could&#39;ve stopped these guys let alone organize them and keep it secret. </p>

<p>Typical false flag is a military target and almost always a ship. </p>

<p>The WTC was attacked by terrorists I believe twice before. </p>

<p>US airport security is awful. </p>

<p>We have always had fascists in the US Senate. Unfortunately they took advantage of 9/11. For that I blame the spineless moderates who went along. </p>

<p>To reiterate, I want to see one shred of evidence that this was a flase flag. Even circumstantial. </p>

<p>you still didn&#39;t address how it is that the most heavily guarded place the earth has ever known was hit by what they say is a 757(a relatively slow aircraft in military terms). nor did you address the tremendous flying maneuvers accomplished by those pilots, especially the pentagon pilot. hitting the bottom floor of a building without scraping the engines of the plane on the grass. oh well, he probably just read lots of books, right? </p>

But precision is not considered any good for a terrorist who would prefer a big blast, many died, mission accomplished.  This 9/11 plot was so highly precise, as precise as a bullet at the 4th button. Which makes it unlikely a terrorist act.</p>

<p>Why would the terrorist become a compulsive attacker?  If they have 5 planes in hand to make a day, just use 1 plane is enough to make such a statement.  It would be easier to crash the plane to the main street and kill more.  That would be easier for the pilot and bigger bang for the buck.  So why two well insured buildings in downtown.</p>

<p>WT7 was an especially strongly-built, steel-framed skyscraper, <em>even stronger</em> than the types that have burned for days on end and still stood.  Think of that when you use the word &#39;sustained&#39; - other, weaker skyscrapers have burned <em>for days on end</em> and still stood.</p>

<p>WT7 burns patchily for a few hours, the building itself and its environs are neatly evacuated and - just like that, as if anticipated - it falls symmetrically into its own footprint.</p>

<p>Christ. There was no commander. They were not in contact with each other. they were on seperate kamikazee missions. This is absolutely clear.

<p>These terrorists have been attacking the WTC for years. It was symbolic for them. I&#39;m not going to go into it, but WTC wasn&#39;t a surprise. Anyone who knows anything about the situation would know that. The other targets are obviously symbolic. </p>

<p>You are right on this one, they should be on separate mission. One goes to the Pentagon, the other to the White House for example.  The weakness of the plot is, if two planes going to the same vicinity, they need good coordination which didn&#39;t exist in that situation. If the first plane has caused a lot of damage, what was the point sending the second plane.  So the pilot on the second plane must have a clear understanding on the damage of the WTC before he drove his plane there.  But why must a rookie kamikaze pick WTC again if he was going to kill himself that day and he has to ask himself all these questions.  Just find a second target. Done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And of course, one must never forget that disregarding all the theories on this alleged conspiracy the facts are that the United States invaded <strong>two</strong> countries and caused the deaths of thousands upon thousands of people. </p>

<p>The investigation into the event that lead up to all this was made once, by one body and it was released and then forgotten. This is why I for one want an independent international investigation into the events. Of course now it&#39;s already 9 years later and might be too late for some things to be investigated. </p>

<p>This is not a conspiracy theory, this is a lack of facts and thorough investigation into an event that caused thousands more deaths, a huge budget deficit and possibly two more enemy nations. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to say that most Iraqis and Afghanis will understand, they won&#39;t understand the secret death squads formed and the completely pointless killings done for amusement. This will destroy America, trust me. </p>

<p>You have a country right now with rampant poverty, disease, crime, corruption, financial problems and on top of that the country just alienated an entire region of people. </p>

<p>The future does not look bright for the United States. </p>

<p>No one is even asking themselves <strong>why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> it came to be that some people out there had such deep rooted hatred for the country that they were willing to do this. And did they have help? </p>

<p><strong><em>ALL</em></strong> sorts of people DID come forward in advance:</p>

<ul>

<li>Arab intelligence agencies</li>

<li>the CIA</li>

<p>There&#39;s <strong><em>virtually nothing you can do</em></strong> with that kind of information.  Which is, of course, why they weren&#39;t able to stop it (and it&#39;s not like they really wanted to stop some vague attack anyways).</p>
