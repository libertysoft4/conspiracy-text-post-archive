    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a very interesting document which I have compiled and put into PDF form. It&#39;s by a guy who posted on the internets saying he was a member of the ruling bloodline we know as the powers that be. The true establishment. He wrote very well and as far as I can reason, his words are entirely internally consistent. Regardless of whether you believe this guy or not, he makes many very profound and deep philosophical points which any investigator of truths would be well-served to consider. </p>

<p>My personal opinion: Of all the philosophical/scientific/spiritual/metaphysical works/ideas/media/experiences I have dealt with, the Law of One (aka the Ra Material) is the most profound and beautiful by far. Until I read the Law of One, I would say that the Upanishads and Vedas and Bhagavad Gita and Tao Te Ching were the most significant ideologies in my life. But man... Whoever Ra is, he is one wise and compassionate... well... entity. &lt;3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think about the following: the order of how life theoretically evolved on this planet. First we had fish, insects, then amphibians, then reptiles, birds, then mammals (or something like that). </p>

<p>Then imagine that some billions of years ago some insects evolved so much that they eventually left Earth. Then came the age of other beings down the evolutionary chain - amphibians, then reptiles (the ones people like David Icke talk about). Then we now have the &quot;fairly unevolved&quot; mammals - us - and eventually we should see some pretty strange birds within a few years!</p>

<p>So, while we think we&#39;re dominant species and the pinnacle of evolution on this planet, in fact we could be just the late bloomers of a long series, barely out of the jungle!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If man was genetically engineered, the engineer could have done a better job. Only 1.5% of the human genome codes for proteins and the Y chromosome can&#39;t isolate maladaptive alleles during meiosis. Not to mention that the Y chromosome will eventually degenerate over millions of years to the point that other chromosomes will have to take over its function for sex typing. The amount of replication errors and mutations that do occur also suggest a pretty shitty job of quality control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why humans use only about 10% of our massively supercharged brains, yet savants can somehow access parts of the remaining 90% </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/10%25_of_brain_myth">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/10%25_of_brain_myth</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>n reality, the 10% myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding (or public misrepresentation) of neurological research undertaken in the late 19th century or early 20th century when researchers either discovered that only about 10% of the neurons in the brain are firing  at any given time or announced that they had only mapped the functions of 10% of the brain at that time (accounts differ on this point). Another possible origin of the 10% myth is that neurons only compose approximately 10% of the cells in the brain; the rest are glial cells that, despite being involved in learning, function differently from neurons</p>

<p><em>Why our skin is so poorly adapted to the amount of sunlight striking Earth?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jablonski 2004 from the Annual Review of Anthropology (behind a pay-wall last I checked) suggested that our nearly hairless skin aids significantly in thermoregulation in hot environments. Pigmentation is a strong adaptation as well because dark pigmentation doesn&#39;t differ much from light pigmentation in terms of heat load under high solar radiation. The distinction between the two types is that lighter pigmentation makes it easier to synthesize vitamin d3 from ultraviolet radiation so you have complementary pigmentation gradients from the equator to the poles and the poles to the equator.</p>

<p><em>Why we are so physically weak compared to our closest genetic relatives?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chimpanzees have stronger, thicker muscle fibers and use a means of locomotion that engages their entire body. They also have less motor neurons compared to humans so they have comparatively less fine motor control. Thus, relatively more muscle force makes up for this.</p>

<p><em>Why Earth is the only planet or moon with moveable tectonic plates?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earth may be a borderline case, owing its tectonic activity to abundant water (Valencia, O&#39;Connell &amp; Sasselov 2007)[65]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plate tectonics requires weak surfaces in the crust along which crustal slices can move, and it may well be that such weakening never took place on Venus because of the absence of water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>plus</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is believed that many planets around other stars will have plate tectonics. On Earth-sized planets, plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of water, [75] but on larger super-earths plate tectonics is very likely even if the planet is dry.</p>

<p><em>Why Earth’s moon is so extraordinarily outsized relative to other moons?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ganymede is the largest satellite in the Solar System. I think Pye means relative to the planet it&#39;s orbiting. Then yes the moon is number one. However, that&#39;s probably because the original object that hit the Earth tossing the ejecta that became the Moon was the size of Mars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Why megalithic structures like the Pyramids cannot be duplicated today?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were multiple and varied techniques involved to construct the Pyramids over many years. Not to mention that there has been evidence that at least some of the construction was jury-rigged and ad hoc so there&#39;s little documentation so of course we can&#39;t duplicate the techniques. And why would we want to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Why humans have a gene pool with over 4000 genetic defects, while our closest genetic relatives, chimps and gorillas, have very few?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point in time, can it satisfactorily be ruled out that perhaps we haven&#39;t studied nonhuman primate genetic defects to the same degree that we&#39;ve done so for humans?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll finish off the ones I missed after some sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think David Icke&#39;s role is to discredit real conspiracies.  There&#39;s a video from awhile back where Alex Jones sums it up real well:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbKOFwUEqCE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbKOFwUEqCE</a></p>

<p>Now it does make more sense if people say that by saying reptilians Icke really means Jews.  And by more sense I mean less batshit crazy but still pretty far out there.</p>
