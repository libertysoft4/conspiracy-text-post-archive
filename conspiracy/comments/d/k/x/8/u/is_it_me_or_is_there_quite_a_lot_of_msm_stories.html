<p>Unless these aliens can help us &quot;advance&quot; and &quot;improve&quot; ourselves, humanity will just turn into situation of mass corruption and deceit because there are no limits to morality and ethics. They are just in place because they are evolutionary functions in community settings. </p>

<p>You will just end up in an Eve Online universe of the haves and have nots even more so than today. It is nothing to look forward to.</p>

<p>In other reddit news, it is apparent there are forces on reddit to devaluate jews by attempting to block relevant alien news articles to be replaced with israel/jewish conspiracy stuff. This real conspiracy is occurring right now on reddit. There is more likely aliens out there than us jews being whacky lizardmen or people who control the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prior to 9/11, conspiracy theorists all had their little insanity niche by which to protect themselves. Now, there <em>seem</em> to be those who don&#39;t hide behind that (ala Alex Jones); while some of them still do (ala Brother Nathaniel, who exposed Alex Jones). Near as I can tell, &quot;shape-shifting reptilians&quot; is Icke&#39;s &quot;insanity front&quot;; it gives those whom he&#39;s talking about a reason to dismiss him -- if you replace &quot;reptilians&quot; with &quot;illuminati&quot;, he sounds just like any other conspiracy theorist. Don&#39;t be fooled by allegories - they&#39;re used all the time by both sides of the fence. Thus, my point in the comment (above): I think this is part of all that thing.</p>

On a side note I found this article years ago and found it rather interesting as it pertains to today</p>

<p>article appeared in the Fall, 1991 issue of &#39;UFO JOURNAL:
<a href="http://www.inquiring-mines.com/aliens_in_suspended_animation.htm">http://www.inquiring-mines.com/aliens_in_suspended_animation.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;I was also told that the calamities that are taking place are for the good of the planet and are causing people to think about alternatives to the present system... I was told that this collapse of the old order will include a collapse of the PRESENT MONETARY SYSTEM, the IMF &amp; the WORLD BANK. </p>

<p>however I must say it is nothing like the UFO stories that appeared in the 70&#39;s which culminated in two huge movies which tapped that interest from the public:
Close Encounters of the Third Kind 
and 
 ET.</p>
