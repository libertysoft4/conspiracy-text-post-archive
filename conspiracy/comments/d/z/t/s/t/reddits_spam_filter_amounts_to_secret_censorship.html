        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I gladly payed up $50.00 a few months back to support Reddit in its time of need, and now have 1 year and 7 months of Reddit Gold membership remaining.</p>

<p>I was quite happy with that situation until a few weeks ago, when I noticed that about half my submissions were not even reaching the New queue in some ordinary subreddits.  None of them were particularly contentious, and in some cases, moderators would help me out.</p>

<p>However, in other cases, my article would not appear, and the moderators would completely ignore my protestations.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, this is not a case of moderators spiking my article: the spam filter acts independently of the moderators.</p>

<p>Such an opaque process can be abused easily, and in secrecy, by censoring anything that anyone wants censored.  The fact that Reddit&#39;s spam filter hits so many innocent bystanders means that if censorship is being applied systematically, it can be plausibly denied as an overactive spam filter.</p>

<p>It seems that every single Internet community has this kind of secret back door: PayPal can freeze your account on a whim, Wikipedia can disappear edits, and Reddit can ensure submitted links are never seen.</p>

<p>I just wish that Reddit was not in the same basket.</p>

<p>EDIT: To address some points made by commentors,</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t believe that anything I have submitted has been deliberately censored: I am just saying that Reddit&#39;s spam filter provides a means to implement censorship without appearing to do so.</li>
<li>The articles which I have had killed by the spam filter have not been material that would be censored, but then again, these articles were from quite reputable, non-spammy sources, such as national newspapers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>If Conde Nast were asked very politely by the US government to remove links to something in particular, they are free to say &quot;Yay&quot; or &quot;Nay&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could it be the domain you&#39;re submitting or any key words you&#39;re using that are spammed heavily on Reddit?</p>

<p>My submission on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dz9rx/full_movie_end_of_liberty_2010/">End of Liberty</a> in <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> got caught in the spam filter, and I PM&#39;d the mods to have a look.  They took care of it.  I&#39;m thinking I triggered the spam filter because either:</p>

<ul>
<li> The term &quot;Full Movie&quot; that I used in the title is probably overused by spammers posting those free movie sites.</li>
<li> I submitted the link once, got the title wrong of the movie so I deleted it.  Resubmitted within 5 min.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think Reddit is pretty fair though when it comes to submissions.  Granted, our material may not get front page&#39;d for those not subscribing to <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>... but Reddit seems to have an almost &quot;anything goes&quot; policy when it comes to subreddits.  I&#39;m new here though, only been here a month.  Still seems MUCH more open than Digg, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>Because a filter which appears negligent provides plausible deniability for a filter which is genuinely censoring some subjects.</p>

<p>Remember: on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, never ascribe to negligence anything which might be deliberately malicious.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The behaviour of the spam filter is quite wacky: the links I have had blocked were non-contentious articles in well regarded newspapers such as the Sydney Morning Herald and The Guardian.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay this makes perfect sense, otherwise the entire conspiracy would be written off entirely.</p>

<p>Well there are plenty of links that make the front page all the time from those websites. </p>

<p>So they could be banned for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The articles are being banned because of specific content that a person or group of people would like censored from the general reddit audience.</p></li>
<li><p>They could be fake false positives to cover up actual censorship elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>The articles could be banned because they are actual false positives, mistakenly removed by the spam filter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If number 1 is the case you should be able to find a pattern in the banned articles. If number 2 is the case there would be no way to distinguish between it and a malfunctioning spam filter, meaning any theory you can propose has equal weight as a simple error.</p>

<p>This is completely true. And it is very plausible that you got placed on a list in the manner you described. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the spam filter has a lot of issues, but really what&#39;s a good alternative to the current filter? Since it has to be commercially and productivity viable for plausibility&#39;s sake, it shouldn&#39;t take up more resources nor require more meddling to keep it working.</p>

<p>It also should not piss off its paying users.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind the fact that the spam filter catches all of the SEO guys.  However, nothing I&#39;ve ever submitted could be construed as spammy.</p>

<p>Downvotes for asking if cojoco had an alternative in mind</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t vote you down.</p>

<p>However, you do seem to be supporting a much-hated item, which gets real downvotes, if not reddiquated downvotes.</p>

<p>However, the initial point is still true: the existence of an automatic spam filter would make automatic censorship trivial to implement, and could be used to silence specific users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely true. And it is very plausible that you got placed on a list in the manner you described. </p>

<p>A spam filter is by nature a form of automatic censorship, I just don&#39;t see why someone would intentionally place you on this list, or who has to gain from it.</p>
