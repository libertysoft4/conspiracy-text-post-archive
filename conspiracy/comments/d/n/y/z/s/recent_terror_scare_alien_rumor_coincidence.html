    <div class="md"><p>Is it such a leap of the imagination to entertain the notion of a world government coalescing out of memetic evolution? One that will avoid the negative impacts of technically being an abstract <em>water monopoly empire</em> by creating a scapegoat, or imaginary influence to steer public attitude into a desired direction? </p>

<p>Change &quot;world,&quot; and &quot;water mon. empire&quot; and you&#39;ve got a great deal of what&#39;s called history. I&#39;m sure you already know this. </p>

<p>Though of course, if you want to believe in little green men over technologically secretive governments, then power to you. Just do us all a favor and don&#39;t jump on the alien bobblehead bandwagon just yet. The simplest explanation must be the most likely, and somehow this doesn&#39;t seem like a very complex concept. We must just disagree in its application.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically what I&#39;m saying is that when putting all rhetoric aside, a government, corporation, or society will behave similarly to an organism. </p>

<p>These abstract organisms exist in different environments than conventional forms of life. So their specific needs are different, but generally speaking all life tends to refine and build upon itself. </p>

<p>A water monopoly empire (WME) is an example of a government or quasi-organism manipulating a resource that people within it rely on as a fundamental necessity. Such a body can gain near absolute control in providing that resource, ensuring its survival. A government operating under these tactics can exist almost indefinitely if there are no external threats. </p>

<p>Think of money in place of water, and a world empire in place of a limited geography. There doesn&#39;t need to be a real threat, just a believable one, for a government to achieve such a stable and secured existence. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s a drawback in that centralization. A WME can whittle its existence down to a corrupt, inefficient, and redundant shell because it managed to maintain control over such a crucial resource. The only likely cause for collapse of a WME is an external influence. </p>

<p>I hope this didn&#39;t further clutter my original point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just woke up. Thought about it after reading that Britain is confident an attack is going to happen there. ..Now I feel like a 12 year old inbred deliverance-nerd for asking about it, because I am a pretty sane guy at all other times than post-waking up. Anyway.. with all the other weird conspiracies in here, I was surprised not to have read about this connection. There are a lot of normal people wishing the alien rumor to be true, just wanted to get the ball rolling because it is a fun and enjoyable subject.. Not terrorism, but, the other parts..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>welcome to your wakefulness--you&#39;ll get over all that fun and enjoyable stuff pretty soon...otherwise--you&#39;re still a zombie...<strong><em>there are some</em></strong> <strong>really bad people</strong> <strong><em>working a</em></strong> <strong>very bad game</strong> <strong><em>to</em></strong> <strong>enslave and murder</strong> <strong><em>most of us on the planet</em></strong>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it&#39;s real because that&#39;s how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it&#39;s very brightly colored, and it&#39;s very loud, and it&#39;s fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry; don&#39;t be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we...kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I&#39;ve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot; <strong>It&#39;s just a ride.</strong> But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok... But it doesn&#39;t matter, because it&#39;s just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It&#39;s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. <strong>Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love.</strong> The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here&#39;s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in--&quot;</p>

But then I believe real important conspiracy theories like &quot;The War on Terror&quot; and 9/11 should be posted in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> because it&#39;d be contra productive for anything worthy of being looked into by a large amount of people to be posted anywhere else.

I enjoy it, can&#39;t help it but feeling a bit fulfilled when people are talking about things that are not apparent in our very normal lives, as long as we can sit in front of a computer screen and chat about it. I get to fantasize about Anti-Gravity, Nazis in Space, Hollow Earths, Time Travel, Reptilians, NWO and so on. It&#39;s all here somewhere, and it beats whatever is on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, there was a news story a week or two ago (at least in major Finnish newspapers; I don&#39;t know about other countries) that the UN had appointed a &quot;contact person&quot; in case of the arrival of aliens. It turns out that the story was false, and that the Malaysian person who supposedly was the appointee knew nothing of the whole thing. </p>

<p>And then the UFO sighting in China. </p>

<p>And Stephen Hawking, among other notable persons, making statements in the media about alien intelligences (in S.H.&#39;s case, he said that aliens should be left alone, if I&#39;m not mistaken). In truth the exact content of these statements doesn&#39;t seem that important; it sounds like they&#39;re trying to get us used to the idea, and that UFO sighting hoaxes might be used to justify further reductions of rights and freedoms, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to bet $10,000 that aliens will <em>not</em> be hovering over any major or minor cities in October. Any takers?</p>

<p>And I&#39;m talking about the kind of hovering that will stop the world and be talked about on every TV channel 24/7 for the rest of the year, not secret invisible hovering that no one was aware of except some guy raving on his red-text-on-black-background website.</p>

If you look at Europe over the past few weeks, you&#39;ll realize that there has been massive protests and strikes run by laborers.  The goal of the terrorist warnings is to keep those people scared and at home, rather than protesting.   </p>

<p>But honestly, if the terrorists threats were actually real, would the terrorists want to fuck over the people protesting the companies and governments that are invading and developing the middle east?</p>

<p>And yes, I do know about Blossom Goodchilds 2008 prediction, and I am not one that wants to believe so much as to believe in utter crap. But I have read it in quite a few posts and articles the last couple of weeks and found it interesting. Maybe it has too much to do with mass media nowadays doing the job that obscure wacky magazines did before 2000. (Man, I miss those)</p>

<p>Igor Panarin is not credited with predicting the fall of USSR(According to his wiki page anyway), and predicted that the USA would be divided into 6 parts in 2010. (hasn&#39;t happened)  </p>

<p>Bill Cooper &quot;predicted&quot; 9/11 in that he reviewed the terrorist report given out in June that had Bin Laden and planes on the cover of the report, then labeled as a &quot;test exercise&quot;.   I don&#39;t buy that as a prediction of the actual date of the event at all, he just got wind of the report and said it on a radio broadcast. </p>

<p>Other than the thousands involved in the Manhattan project, and assuming it would eventually be used, not one person predicted a date of a bomb being used on foreign soil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically what I&#39;m saying is that when putting all rhetoric aside, a government, corporation, or society will behave similarly to an organism. </p>

<p>These abstract organisms exist in different environments than conventional forms of life. So their specific needs are different, but generally speaking all life tends to refine and build upon itself. </p>

<p>A water monopoly empire (WME) is an example of a government or quasi-organism manipulating a resource that people within it rely on as a fundamental necessity. Such a body can gain near absolute control in providing that resource, ensuring its survival. A government operating under these tactics can exist almost indefinitely if there are no external threats. </p>

<p>Think of money in place of water, and a world empire in place of a limited geography. There doesn&#39;t need to be a real threat, just a believable one, for a government to achieve such a stable and secured existence. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s a drawback in that centralization. A WME can whittle its existence down to a corrupt, inefficient, and redundant shell because it managed to maintain control over such a crucial resource. The only likely cause for collapse of a WME is an external influence. </p>

<p>I hope this didn&#39;t further clutter my original point.</p>
