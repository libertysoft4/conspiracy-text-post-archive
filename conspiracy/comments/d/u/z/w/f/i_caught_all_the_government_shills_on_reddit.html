<p>So, there it is.  Proof that reddit&#39;s been subject to a propaganda campaign.  This is not a call to violence, I must emphasize that violence is what got us into this problem to begin with.</p>

<p>Notably, one of these people <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/IrielFaid">IrielFaid</a> has deleted his/her account since the exposure began.  If you think I&#39;m just linking to a nonexistant account to trick you, look through <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/search?q=irielfaid">/r/anarchism</a> for the various times he/she was mentioned as a disruptive troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I guess I have to. </p>

<p>First of all, 9/11 was an inside job.  Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Y4CB2ReUo">proof</a>.  Second, the &quot;Holocaust&quot; was a dramatic exaggeration of German atrocities to create a nationalistic religion for U.S. and Israel (&quot;the Shoah&quot;).  Hitler represented the epitome of all evil (he was described as wanting to destroy the entire Jewish race - but in reality, his only motivations were political) within the context of that religion.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dewhy/dont_even_think_about_downvoting_this_we_have_to/">Here&#39;s the proof</a> for that.  Every war that the U.S. has fought overseas in the last century has been a war of imperialist expansion, resulting from a &quot;false flag&quot; attack on U.S. soil or U.S. property/interests/etc..  Here&#39;s a <a href="http://911blogger.com/node/6633">summary</a>, here&#39;s <a href="http://www.nuclearfreenz.org.nz/FalseFlagco.htm">a bigger list of links</a>.  I am omitting the question of nuclear weapons, simply because people can draw their own conclusions about that...</p>

<p>What else....let&#39;s see.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics">Global warming</a> was a hoax, the theory that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/altmed">HIV causes AIDS was a hoax</a>, the notion that viruses cause cancer was a hoax (for vaccine sales - HPV vaccines in particular), hell, the entirety of vaccination was a misguided/deceptive effort at augmenting the naturally sufficient functions of the immune system.  ObamaCare wasn&#39;t a hoax, it seems, but it was very poorly and irresponsibly written (see the White House insider interviews).  The New Deal was a hoax by FDR to expand government power (culminating in World War Two) - this is clear enough by the nature of the programs FDR initiated.  The Federal Reserve was a hoax to take over this country&#39;s monetary system, culminating with Nixon&#39;s abolition of the gold standard.  Monsanto represents an attempt to disrupt the process of life itself, by introducing non-reproducing seeds into third world countries, so that farmers would have to buy seeds on a subscription basis.  Coca-Cola, Pepsi, etc., have conspired to make Americans obese by introducing processed sugars in dramatic quantities into the American diet (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM">proof</a>), which has resulted in &quot;epidemics&quot; of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cirrhosis, and who knows how many other diseases.  The &quot;drug war&quot; has been a campaign to imprison a large segment of the U.S.&#39;s minority population, for profit (look up Harry Anslinger, or the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, or current minority imprisonment rates).</p>

<p>There are many, many facets to what&#39;s happened, so I&#39;m only including additional sources <em>on request</em> (and, please, just look them up yourself, if possible - it&#39;s not difficult).  I hope you don&#39;t mind.  This is not an exhaustive list, either, this is a list I banged out in about 5 minutes - although it sums up the culmination of about 10 years of research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a molecular biologist I can tell you - you clearly don&#39;t know enough about science to have a (sensible) opinion on viruses or cancer.</p>

<p>I have personally transformed mammalian cells using viruses.  (Transformation means disabling mechanisms that inhibit cell division - cancer cells also have these mechanisms disabled, along with other modifications)</p>

<p>Aside from that though, maybe these people follow you because they disagree with you?  Or they just don&#39;t like you (no offence)?  Why would the government waste it&#39;s money paying people to harass you when most of reddit would do that for free?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your subreddit you link to <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a>, so as per usual, I am going to put on my thinkers hat and analyze what you said. </p>

<p>You have the proposition and a conclusion that follows from it. </p>

<p>|And getting down voted means what?</p>

<p>/\ Proposition</p>

<p>|Potheads lose all perception and think up or down votes mean something. They have so little else in life.</p>

<p>/\ Conclusion</p>

<p>Now, you must be able to see that one does not follow from the other. You have made no reason - no argument why there should be any correlation or causation from one to the other. </p>

<p>It is a baseless ad hominem fallacy. Why do you resort to such petty insults? Are you really angry that there are people not like you in the world? </p>

<p>If you become so vehement with what can only be observed as anger at the mere knowledge someone might view reality with a different perception - how are you better than someone who hates arbitrarily for other reasons? </p>

<p>Oh, and, the answer to your question. Getting downvoted is a display of the approval from within the community, different communities I find follow different Reddiquette. Some subreddits downvote you not because of content or the insightful (or lack thereof) nature of a comment, but simply because they hate <em>you</em>, or what they assume you stand for. Other places - like here, and <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a>, tend to ignore your past history, or what you stand for, and vote depending on the content of individual comments and their worth.</p>
