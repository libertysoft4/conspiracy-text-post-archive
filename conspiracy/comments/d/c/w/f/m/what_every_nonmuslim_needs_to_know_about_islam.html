    <div class="md"><p>My point was to look past the references to Christianity if you do not agree with it, and focus on the text of the Koran. I was in a Political Science class a few days ago, and was listening to a girl talk about Islam as a &quot;religion of peace&quot;. I decided to do some research and found some contradictory evidence. I&#39;ve never seen this page before, so I thought I would share it.</p>

<p>I am going to site the findings from this page in the next class debate, and wanted to hear opposing and supporting opinions so that I am better prepared.</p>

<p>It’s in conspiracy because I could not think of a better place to put it, where would you suggest I file it under?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk atheism, Im sure they would help you show Islam as a horrible religion. However it has been shown plenty of times, that the Bible has more passages about violence than the Quran, and when the Muslims conquered Jerusalem they allowed people to leave without harm, when the Christians took the city they slaughtered thousands, including Arab Christians and Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Within 100 years of the invention of Islam, Muslims had wiped out 80% of all Christians on the face of the planet with the sword. The modern &quot;Orthodox&quot; church (eastern, Byzantine) was almost entirely destroyed. Before this Islamic-initiated holocaust, the Byzantine church was 5 times larger than the &quot;western/roman Catholic&quot; church. Today the Roman Catholic church is 10 times larger than the Orthodox, as a testimony to this slaughter they endured at the hands of the Muslims. Had this slaughter not occurred, the Orthodox church would be 10 times larger than the Roman Catholic today. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the bible is without violence, but I&#39;m mainly talking about the core message behind Islam. </p>

<p>Christianity is the religion where God sends his own son to die for your sins. Islam is the religion where Allah wants you to die for him. Jesus said love your enemies. Muhammad said murder your enemies with a bloody sword. When Jesus was mocked, ridiculed and tortured, he turned the other cheek, and endured it in silence. &quot;He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth. When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead he entrusted himself to him who judges justly&quot; (1 Peter 2:22, 23). When Muhammad was so much as questioned, he ordered their immediate murder. </p>

<p>I really hope people look at this as a debate, and not a religion bash fest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exod 21:2-8 2 &quot;If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything. 3 If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him. 4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free. 
 5 &quot;But if the servant declares, &#39;I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,&#39; 6 then his master must take him before the judges. [a] He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life. </p>

<p>7 &quot;If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as menservants do. 8 If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, [b] he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her. 9 If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. 10 If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. 11 If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.</p>

<p>&quot;It would appear that you are referring to Ex. 21:7, rather than Ex. 20.</p>

<p>Using the traditional commentaries, including Rashi and Ibn Ezra (11th century), it was possible for a man living thousands of years ago in ancient Israel to place his minor daughter with a household, intending that the purchase-money paid to the father was a bride price; she would marry the master of the house or his son. It was not a sale into slavery or even into indentured servitude but rather service in a new house-hold. </p>

<p>She cannot be abused in any fashion. When she is betrothed to his son or to himself, she is protected as a daughter or a wife. She can leave that house and her role as a woman in the house after six years, or in the Jubilee or when she reaches her majority. She can&#39;t be &quot;sold&quot; to another like property - although the authorities differ on the exact meaning of &quot;foreign,&quot; whether to another Israelite or not. </p>

<p>These laws refer to a historical period that was long ago, thousands of years ago when Judaism uniquely came forward to distinguish between human beings and property. It would take a great deal of space and time to explain these differences, but Jewish law is perceived today by scholars to have been a major advance over the legal codes of the nations surrounding ancient Israel. Not only were human beings protected, Judaism protected in law all socio-economic levels of humanity, while other legal codes would put the value of property above that of human life depending upon socio-economic status. </p>

<p>Most importantly, Jewish law continued to evolve and interpret the will of God to protect each human being more and more, adult or child, parent or child, as the centuries passed. </p>

<p>For this reason, I can understand how in one context of antiquity a law provided for a father to arrange a marriage and collect a bride-price that looks like a sale, nonetheless the young girl was protected also under those ancient laws and even more and more afterwards through the centuries. </p>

<p>I would urge you to read the Encyclopedia Judaica in the library on &quot;bride-price&quot; and related articles ( Huppah (marriage ceremony); Matrimony; Wedding; Bride and Bridegroom) , from which the following is taken: </p>

<p>&quot;Generally, prior to the consummation of the marriage a betrothal was entered into; under this arrangement the bride-price (mohar) was established (Gen. 34:12; Ex. 22:16; I Sam. 18:25), accompanied by a gift (mattan; Gen. 34:12). A time limit was set by which the payments were to be completed and the marriage put into effect (I Sam. 18:17–19, 26:27). The engagement was a legal transaction in the fullest sense. An engaged man was exempt from military service (Deut. 20:7). The legal status of a betrothed virgin was such that she was prohibited to other men. If someone besides her fiancM had intercourse with her, she was held guilty of adultery. If the act took place in town, where she could have cried for help, the woman was equally guilty; but if it happened in the country she was exonerated by the benefit of the doubt—perhaps she did cry out and was not heard (Deut. 22:23–27).&quot; </p>

<p>Best wishes on your studies and I am sure that with this perspective you&#39;ll be encouraged to see the wisdom of an evolving legal and religious system that respected human dignity of every man, woman and child.</p>

<p>Best Wishes, </p>

<p>Rabbi Barry Dov Lerner&quot;</p>

<p>Does that satisfy your answer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lies.</p>

<p>Every Christian should be aware of these. The following endorses genocide, violence, rape, forced marriages, infanticide, and even cannibalism.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;..devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey. &quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us, he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>“But of the cities of these peoples which {Allah} gives you as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive, but you shall utterly destroy them.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;And when [Allah] shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Their children shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes! There houses spoiled, and their wives raped...Dash the young men to pieces...have no pity on the fruit of the womb, the children shall not be spared...&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;So [he] smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as [Allah] commanded.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;And [he] smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel. And [he] saved neither man nor woman alive.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the female children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>“If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out, then the man who lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her..&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;And if you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and desire her and would take her for your wife, then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails. She shall put off the clothes of her captivity, remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a full month; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall set her free.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Make ready to slaughter his sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they rise and posses the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If there be found among you... man or woman....who hath gone and served other gods and worshiped them, either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded...then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman who has committed that wicked thing unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones till they die.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a snare in your midst. But you shall destroy their altars..&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;You will chase your enemies, and they shall fall by the sword before you. Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall by the sword before you.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before {Allah} against the sun.”</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;They shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up!&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>“And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.”</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These Verses are brutal and terrifying. The only problem is, <strong>they are NOT from the Qu&#39;ran, they are ALL from the Bible.</strong> It&#39;s not hard to rip troubling verses out from their original surroundings, like so many of us have done to our Muslim neighbors, taking no consideration for context, interpretation and application. And by the way, some of these verses IN context are no less troubling. But those of us who believe and follow the Bible (at least most of us) are not plotting and carrying out genocide, violence, etc. etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and you are sure Orthodox Christians weren&#39;t slaughtered by Mongols as well?  The Caliphate never captured Byzantium, that fell to the Ottomans long after the death of Muhammad.  Much of the Caliphate spread out over Northern Africa, which was sparsely populated, in Egypt there were the Coptic Christians, who still survive to this day, in Lebanon there are the Mennonites, who also still survive and thrive, and in Palestine, there are plenty of Christians as well.  Surely Islam has not always been at peace with those around them, however Europe has a much more detailed history of violence against outsiders and minorities.  We hardly need to mention the violence against Jews long before the second world war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for calling Christianity a religion of peace, George W. Bush considered himself a very devout Christian, so when a small group of terrorists motivated mainly by political rather than religious reasons killed a couple thousand Americans surely one would expect a Christian to turn the other cheek, or seek a peaceful resolution to this outrageous attack.  Instead he sought vengeance, and for our 2,000 dead Americans he ordered the destruction of 2 countries, and an estimated 500,000 people have died in the ensuing chaos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to know a few things.</p>

<h2>1.That we are bing lied to about the true nature of Islam. Islam is not a religion of peace as we hear in school and in the news.</h2>

<p>We are currently in a war, and the other side claims that it is a holy war. I want to put things in perspective for people (among them are my family and friends) who serve in the military and other diplomatic positions. 
 &quot;Yasser Arafat actually cited the fact that Muhammad broke the truce of Hudaybiyyah, as a precedent for breaking the Oslo accords. &quot;A &quot;hudna&quot; isn&#39;t a peace treaty. It&#39;s a temporary truce called by a Muslim warrior who&#39;s losing in battle. It&#39;s pretty easy to understand how hudnas work by watching Israel fight Hamas and Hezbollah. Those two terrorist groups lob rockets and send suicide bombers into Israel for months; then, every once in a while, Israel deploys its military and flattens Hamas and Hezbollah, who then call for a &quot;hudna&quot;. The UN intervenes, saving Hamas and Hezbollah to fight another day. That&#39;s a hudna: a tactical truce for a strategic advantage.&quot; Ezra Levant. &quot;</p>

<p>No, I am not saing muslims are bad people. That is like saying all christians are hypocrites. Some are, the majority are not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Highly suggested? It seems to me that anyone who didn&#39;t follow those guidelines were severely punished in the old testament. Can you explain something to me? If the Old testament basically is the root to your religion (before the New one, unless you are Catholic) then shouldn&#39;t your religion also be put to blame for being a religion of hate and violence? I mean, I don&#39;t care what time period you are in, if some teenagers call you bald, you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to call on god to kill them with she-bears.</p>

<p>Unless he&#39;s just playing games, I wonder why he thinks only non-Muslims need to &quot;know&quot; this. Surely it would be more important to tell Muslims? Unless, of course, he wanted to ensure that no Muslims actually read it and find out what he&#39;s up to ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics, my friend, is something that can be hidden behind religion. I suggest a Political Science refresher class at your local community college.
Look under the tearm Political Ideologies and propaganda.
I&#39;d hardly say the terrorists had any politics on their mind.
Zabiullah Mujahid -- one of two spokesmen for the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. 
&quot; &quot;We ask from the beginning and we say once again one to enforce the Sharia law and Islamic government in Afghanistan, and to remove foreign forces remove from our country.&quot;
&quot;&quot;Afghanistan will be the Vietnam for them, concerning their policy, it is the same Bush policy. There no changes in this policy. I want to tell you clearly we will win, and they will die.&quot;...</p>

<p>That kinda blurs the line between government policy, and political idealism.... just saying.</p>
