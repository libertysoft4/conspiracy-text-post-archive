<p>&quot;The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to destroy the other governments and in order to weaken the religions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War, International Communism must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…
We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Is there any merit to this, or is it fabricated? Apparently the letter was first published in 1959.. if it&#39;s bullshit, it&#39;s interesting how William Guy Carr could have forseen the current Arab-Western conflict, with Israel-Iran as the catalyst. The media seems determined to stir up controversy, from the muhammad cartoons, ground zero mosque, the Koran burning etc.</p>

<p>(Readers who argue that the terms Nazism and Zionism were not known in 1871 should remember that the Illuminati  invented both these movements.  In addition, Communism as an ideology, and as a coined phrase, originates in France during the Revolution.  In 1785, Restif coined the phrase four years before revolution broke out.  Restif and Babeuf, in turn, were influenced by Rousseau - as was the most famous conspirator of them all, Adam Weishaupt.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so the word &quot;Nazi&quot; is a contraction for the German pronunciation of National Socialist.  It was coined no earlier than 1924, although some sources have it even later.  You&#39;re saying the Illuminati coined the term 50-60 years before anyone ever heard it, kept the term secret waiting for the day they could actually use it, 50 years later then launched the National Socialism movement in Germany, and made sure the phrase they coined 50-60 years prior was used?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly disagree.  Religion is a tool for mass manipulation, atheist encourages critical thought.  It is clear which is the more healthy for society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If my life depended on the moral and ethical choices of an Atheist or a Buddhist, I would place my fate in the hands of the Buddhist long before the Atheist. </p>

<p>Atheism does not encourage critical thought. Atheism does not encourage anything but disbelief in God, and that is as far as it goes. It does not give guidance. It does not promote morals and it is not more healthy for society. If that was the case Soviet Russia and Cuba would be Atheist Utopias rather than cesspools for corruption and human rights violations.</p>

<p>Religion has been <strong>used</strong> for mass manipulation. Butter knives have been <strong>used</strong> to commit robbery and murder. The point is that the nature of a tool is not implicit in the way it is used, but by whom it is being used by.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is nothing definite about being Atheist. And Atheist can be anyone from anywhere being influenced by anything. And make no mistake, they are influenced because we are all influenced by outside stimuli. The one thing that cannot be denied is that without a guide to morality, and there are precious few that aren&#39;t based upon the belief of a God, can their morality can be described as anything but ambiguous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, if your actions are based on the fear that some imaginary sky-fairy is going to send you to hell after you die, I really would rather not place my fate in your hands.</p>

<p>Fact is, basic morality like not murdering or stealing, is a universal thing for logical reasons, not religious.</p>

<p>Christianity has been the religion behind everything from the Nazis to the largest empire in the world (American).  At least in these states where atheism was prevalent, it was not used as a tool for manipulating public opinion in favour of atrocities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, <strong>seriously</strong>, if all you read out of the word &quot;religion&quot; is &quot;Christianity&quot; then I guess this argument is moot because of your blinded rage against <strong>one</strong> religion out of <strong>thousands</strong>.

<p>This makes me wonder if you are an Atheist or a Militant Anti-Christian. I do not care if you believe in a sky-fairy or not. You&#39;re views suggest you are looking for destruction of people with differing viewpoints, and that makes you the same as any religious fanatic.

    <div class="md"><p>I told you that I was an Atheist in my first reply to you. That would make you assume that I am a Christian. Please explain how you would come to such an assumption? </p>

<p>You say that you are not looking for the destruction of anyone yet you equate Naziism to Christianity. Every skinhead I ever met was an Atheist and the Nazis are known to have persecuted and exterminated Priests. Nazi&#39;s used mythology and Christianity to manipulate the population. That relates to my post above. My screws are tight thank you.</p>

<p>I call into doubts your morals, and that I do not know you. That proves that I am correct in assuming that people who claim to be Atheists have ambiguities on any aspect that is not related to their belief in God. </p>

<p>Where did I say that it <em>requires</em> a belief in any deity to have solid morals? I agree it&#39;s a ridiculously stupid thing to say. The only person here that said that is you. </p>

<p>I stand by my opinions that you are demonstrating a significant lack of critical thinking skills for an Atheist. You bash Christianity by applying Naziism and American Politics to them without crediting them with Mother Theressa, the creation of the first Hospitals and the Salvation Army. You insult my intelligence rather then present clear, rational thoughts. </p>

<p>My original statement was of the idea that religion, as a teacher and guide for growth in mental and social well-being, is valuable to a majority of the human population, who without such a guide will have difficulty in developing such skills independently. </p>

<p>Expanding on that thought, with Atheism being adopted by more and more people the good lessons from these religions will not be taught from generation to generation, losing those moral guidepoints. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an aside, let me point out that when I mention religion I am referring to all of them, not just &quot;the Jesus&quot;. </p>

<p>Selfishness, greed and self-interest are also intrinsic qualities of humanity, in addition to empathy. It&#39;s not that I have given WAY too much credit to religion. It&#39;s that I will not give any credit to a mojority of individual humans to foster morals without guidance. </p>

<p>Do you believe that empathy is enough to guide morals past self-preservation? </p>

<p>A native Indian in the Amazon was part of a tribe that had not made formal contact with outsiders. His village had been razed by bulldozers and his tribe likely killed by encroaching loggers. When he was approached by government officials he shot one through the chest with an arrow and fled into the woods. How does your empathy quality hold up to that situation? </p>

<p>The emotion of Empathy can only be depended upon when populations are small enough to have reason for said empathy. In a small village of 30-100, sure empathy goes a long way. In a city like New York, people will walk over your dying corpse before helping you. Empathy is a limited emotion that does not scale.</p>

<p>As far as Jesus helping Psychopaths, well, if the psychopath becomes a Preist, maybe that can be a form of help (because the best accomplice is a Pope). Joking aside, many people with social and mental illnesses have found solace in a Buddhist Monastery.</p>

<p>A guy who&#39;s had his whole world destroyed lashes out at unknown visitors? Color me shocked. If only he&#39;d been religious I&#39;m sure he&#39;d have an entirely different reaction (suicide vest instead of bows and arrows, LOL).</p>

<p>The emotion of Empathy can only be depended upon when populations are small enough to have reason for said empathy. </p>

<p>Crap. Salem witch trials (hysteric small pop), Haiti donations (empathetic large pop), need I say more?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a city like New York, people will walk over your dying corpse before helping you.</p>

<p>I&#39;d wager that the bystander effect is <strong>stronger</strong> in religious people (being that their numbers contain more weak minded sheep).</p>

<p>The fact that the most secular areas of the world tend to be the most safe and stable blows your whole argument to hell. </p>

<p>&quot;Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p>Communist Manifesto writer Karl Marx was born a Jew, the grandson of two rabbis, and was converted to Christianity at age 6. </p>

<p>Leon Trotsky, whose real name was Lev Bronstein, was born and raised a Jew but later declared himself &quot;an internationalist.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemasonry Described by Albert Pike</p>

<p>In Morals and Dogma, Pike wrote:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it, or would pervert it....

The truth must be kept secret, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason…

every man&#39;s conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cultivation and intellectual powers, and moral excellence. God is, as man conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself...&quot; 1
</code></pre>

<p>The next statement reduces the Masonic philosophy to a single premise. Pike writes:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black god but the negation of God.  The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry.

Lucifer, the Light Bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls?

Doubt it not!&quot;
