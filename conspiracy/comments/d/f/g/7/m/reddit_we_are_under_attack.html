        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m talking of course about Stewart / Colbert, not the usual trolls we get here. Control dissent by leading dissent remember? </p>

<p>The theme is &quot;Restore Sanity&quot; and he&#39;s basically saying that things are fucked up but we should all just chill out and debate it rationally. Fuck this shit. We can all see that we&#39;re accelerating on a downward spiral rights and liberties continue to erode, war continues, the rich own more now than they ever have, etc, etc. Yes on one side you have the MSM, elites, politicians, bankers, etc, they are not going to &quot;restore sanity&quot; or whatever, then you have the people, the Redditors they are reaching out to, and we have every right to be enraged at what&#39;s happening to our country.</p>

<p>I guess restoring sanity also means not questioning 911, I&#39;m not going to get into that as it speaks for itself. It&#39;s just kind of funny that he through that one in there. </p>

<p>As a member of the Reddit community I&#39;m offended that these guys are reaching to us for support, telling us what to think, and claiming that we support them. I would love to see a Reddit poll, I&#39;m sure a large percent of users believe 911 was an inside job. </p>

<p>tldr: Stewart &amp; Colbert can go suck a fuck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that they both are reading lines and acting in their shows.  However, you are ignoring the fact that they both have a healthy say in the general direction of their shows, and sometimes even the specific writing.  You are also ignoring the fact that both of them have been in public Q&amp;A or interview situations where there is no help from other writers, both on their own shows and in other programs such as Jon Stewart&#39;s famous interview on &quot;Crossfire&quot;.  (Colbert still plays a dumb right winger in these situations, but in a satirical way.)</p>

<p>On top of this, saying that they never attack hot button issues is a little short sighted.  I say this because 1) It&#39;s sometimes flat out wrong.  Just last week on The Daily Show, they were discussing racial slurs after Dr. Laura dropped the &quot;n bomb&quot; on her show.  They often discuss Prop 8 and abortion and many other things that are fairly controversial.  And 2) They work for Comedy Central, which I&#39;m sure has final cut over their shows.  Just like when South Park was censored by CC for showing an image of Muhammed, I&#39;m sure if The Daily Show or Colbert ran something being extremely controversial, Comedy Central or it&#39;s parent company might not allow it to air for fear of backlash and losing advertising revenue.  So, I think they show be commended for discussing the things that they do, not shunned for having a limit that is imposed on them by their network.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you are so downvoted is so telling of this subreddit&#39;s nature.</p>

<p>Stewart has been critical of Isreal. Stewart has stood up to the media circus that was CNN Crossfire- and won. Colbert delivered a very chilling, yet funny speech at the white house press core dinner. You can&#39;t say these men have done nothing to help better the state of media and democracy, and even if you can- so what, it&#39;s a fucking comedy show, not a fucking movement.</p>

<p>Also, fuck teabaggers. There is a real jaded group that&#39;s merely playing into the propaganda of the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years back I read an article about Jon Stewart promoting his hosting of an awards show (I believe it was the 78th Academy Awards). In the article Stewart joked that 95% of the writing staff on The Daily Show were Harvard educated Jews. Something about that made me very uncomfortable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus. I don&#39;t think the rally is about telling everyone to &quot;chill out.&quot; I interpreted the restoration of sanity theme as a retaliation to the tea partiers and how batshit crazy they are. </p>

<p>As far as 911 goes, I&#39;m with you. But these are still television personalities that have to maintain ratings. Even if Stewart or Colbert do agree about such touchy subjects, there&#39;s no way the network would let them talk about it. We&#39;re lucky there&#39;s something this left-leaning in the public scope. Expecting them to share the exact same views and be able to share them unedited is unreasonable and greedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They basically equated Tea Party cos-players with the 9/11 Truth movement, for no apparent reason. </p>

<p>What was the point of yelling &quot;9/11 was an OUTSIDE job?&quot;. AFAIK it is completely irrelevant to the Beck rally, as they are virtually all 9/11 Faithers. It was an unprovoked attack on the billions around the world who doubt the 9/11 Commission Report, including <a href="http://www.911summary.com/">many of its authors</a>.</p>

<p>I am perplexed as to the motivation for that, and for the time being have lost a lot of respect for The Daily Show team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Viacom owns comedy central, As of 2010, it is the world&#39;s fourth-largest media conglomerate, behind The Walt Disney Company, Time Warner and News Corporation.  IE big business and they love money, so why wouldn&#39;t they support the sit down, shut up corporate takeover of America.<br/>
Funny thing is both the daily show and Colbert report are fake news shows.  You think its an accident it comes on after southpark.  How many brainwashed teens that sit through that mindless dribble then when their brain is mush they fill it right back up with propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stewart can get away with speaking against Israel only slightly. Colbert can&#39;t say anything. Stewart being Jewish is able to snipe at Israel, which he sometimes does, but mostly Viacom tells him to STFU.</p>

<p>Viacom is owned by this guy:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumner_Redstone">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumner_Redstone</a>
HBO, Comedy Central, CBS</p>

<p>Fox is owned by Murdoch, another zionist. Both sides, left or right, are owned by zionists. They keep pushing this fight between democrats and republicans to divide and conquer.</p>

<p>I like Stewart &amp; Colbert but the people they work for are manipulative fuckers who are intentionally using media shaping to push for Israel first.
Reddit is under attack because the corporations hate places where people can think and speak freely.</p>

<p>Go ahead and support the rally. It&#39;ll be interesting but don&#39;t be surprised if this &#39;new movement&#39; doesn&#39;t get corrupted like what happened to the tea partiers.</p>
