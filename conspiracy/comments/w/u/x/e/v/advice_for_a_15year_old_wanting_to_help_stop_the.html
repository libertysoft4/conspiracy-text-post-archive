    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Capitalism isn&#39;t what got us into this mess, fractional reserve banking, usury, and all of the crazy financial devices like mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps did. As long as a regulatory body can ensure that companies and banks are accounting for their externalities and commit to sound banking capitalism works fine. People will read that and think that idea is a pipe dream, but it&#39;s really an indication of how far we&#39;ve strayed off the path from sustainable economics.</p>

<p>Also, you can print money without needing to back it with anything like gold and silver. Colonial scrip and Lincoln&#39;s greenbacks are a perfect example of how money that is unbacked can be used with success without indebting the country to any banker. This is the reason why we had the Revolutionary war and why Lincoln was assassinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. When mad King George was fighting Napoleon he was spending way too much money borrowed from the Bank of England. In order to repay the debts, King George leveed taxes heavily on the colonists.

    <div class="md"><p>There are many sides of the story that the establishment historians have purposely left out. Napoleon eventually lost that war and was exiled. He escaped and wanted to finance another war against the British, but refused to be financed by the international bankers (the Rothschilds) who had financed him the first time. These same bankers decided to finance the British more, ultimately causing the British to win. So Napoleon sold all of the French territory west of the Mississipi to the US and we sent him I think $3 Million in gold bullion. Now you know how the US got so lucky with the Louisiana Purchase, literally pennies for an acre. When Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, a courier paid by Nathan Meyer Rothschild immediately left the battlefield to bring the news to him, but to nobody else. Everyone knew that this battle would decide who would be the reigning military and financial power in Europe. When Rothschild began selling and pulling his money out, Britain panicked thinking that they had lost Waterloo and stock prices and values dropped. Rothschild then bought all of them for literally pennies on the dollar, and when the news from government couriers had returned that Napoleon was defeated, investors began putting their money back into the markets, but into the market that Nathan Meyer Rothschild owned and would profit from. And that&#39;s how the Rothschilds took over England.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read this story about how he got the information before the rest of the market and was able to make a killing before in some books and on the net. I know that the Rothschilds are megarich and control a large/perhaps major part of the City and other European cities/markets, but I don&#39;t have a very good feel for about how much of the City they control vis-a-vis other actors in Europe. There were/are a lot of rich Christians in Europe and they must have had a certain amount of control as well, but I don&#39;t have a very good feeling for it. The royal families clearly have a lot of say and control as well as money to do things with. I find these historical facts very interesting and wish that I knew more than I do. I know that we know even less than we know about history about what is going on right now. They have better control of the information and better tabs on the opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is a defunct system. 95% of all jobs can be replaced by machines easily. The only jobs machines cannot do are ones that involved creativity...and usually jobs involving creativity are the ones people like to do regardless of montary reward.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yes, they are an intrinsic part of capilalism. In a montary system people are going to do whatever it takes to make money regardless of ethics. The &quot;free market&quot; is never going to be able to accomadate 100% of the population with &quot;jobs&quot; so the people who do not have jobs are going to resort to devious ways to make money. Capitalism is a competitive, dog-eat-dog game, where everybody works towards their own selfish self-interests and nothing more. And the government can make anything illegal but that does not actually change anything. Marijuana is illegal, but just look at r/trees. As long as the montary system exists there is going to be drug trafficing, human trafficing, scarcity, organized crime, and much more. You cannot pick and choose what are &quot;aspects&quot; of capitalism. All the problems in our world are aspects of capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s best to just drop a tidbit of info here and there to get people thinking.  Never align yourself with people like Alex Jones, even if you do like his info.  Link to his sources instead.  While his confrontational style is entertaining, to the unitiated it will just make you come off like a conspiracy nut and everything you say will be invalid at that point.  Joe Rogan does a good job on his podcast of bringing up conspiracies in a way that&#39;s more inclusive to those not used to it, if you wanna give his broadcast a listen.  I&#39;d recommend the Michael Ruppert, Rick Ross, or Adam Kokesh episodes.</p>

<p>Stopping corruption itself is a really tough thing to do, especially for one person... I think it would be easier to focus in on one thing you want to change and work towards that.  Drug laws, justice reform, militarism, The Fed, etc.  Then again you may turn out like Julian Assange and do a pretty decent job attacking a broad problem like that... but it&#39;s pretty tough.</p>

<p>But really at this point the best thing that anyone can do for any issue is to raise awareness about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be patient, be dilligent, and go to school. Play the game and always learn for yourself the truth but keep it to yourself. Then one day when you graduate. Play the adult world game, and make a mass fortune of about 60 billion. Even if it means that others think you disgusting. Play their game of deception, and then when the times is right. Form your own network to counter the evil in the world, and crush the enemy. Keep your friends closer, but your enemies even more closer. You hit the enemy when, and where they least expect it, and to come with overwhelming force. Study the Art of War by Sun Tzu.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t feel you can do that. Then try your best in your own way, but at least enjoy the good things in this world. What you make your own spiritually they can&#39;t take away. They can only take worldly things.</p>

<p>Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>Capitalism is just fine ... corruption is the problem. The Arab Spring and OWS is essentially the same thing - the system is more profoundly unfair to greater numbers of people in Muslim countries and this has given that political movement better results. Transparency, the internet and justice are crucial. You are in a unique position. If we can maintain control over the web, the banksters, corporations and politicians will be knocked down a few pegs, sooner than any of us can imagine.</p>

Both in the public and private areas, this happens everyday.</p>
