        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Obviously the banks suck, religion sucks, government sucks, horrible things are happening in every way and have been since forever. Media is controlled on every single level. We&#39;re all doomed, right?
The new world order cant be achieved through outwardly horrific things so, in comes &quot;aliens&quot;. Every aspect of media has been pushing the alien agenda lately and it seems pretty imminent. 
So, who are you supposed to look for real answers from? A bunch of blonde haired, white skinned &quot;lightworkers&quot;? Alright, assume for one second that the Hollow earth is real and the &quot;Agarthans&quot; live there. These people are also known as the Atlantians, Aryans, countless other A words. 
Zeus being Satan, Apollo being the antichrist. Also worshipped by the freemasons and illuminati. They supposedly have super advanced technology and are coming from space instead of the center of the earth though? 
Look at this in the most simple biblical fantasy way of putting it. God cast down satan where he lives in hell in the center of the earth, we&#39;re up here and life sucks but we can be saved. Pretty simple.
 Im not christian and I&#39;ve been atheist since i was very young until now basicly. The truth might come with a bit of humility but it&#39;s better than thinking that just because someone preaches peace and love and gives you cool shit, that they actually love you or give a fuck about you at all. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that the bible was edited, re-edited, translated and re-translated by many different people over history. Also keep in mind the many crimes against humanity the church has committed in its long run a top the pyramid of our society. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the church is evil or that there is no place for faith or Christianity in our world, but keep that in mind when talking about bible prophecy. </p>

<p>You are correct that Hitler&#39;s quest to create the Aryan race was fomented by a belief in the Pleidians, Agarthans etc. but that does not mean one approves of Hitler by believing in those groups. As you said smart people lie, but those same people can extrapolate and twist information to fit their own motives and desires. Many religions are guilty of this, the church of Scientology comes to mind. </p>

<p>Edit: I don&#39;t mean to be contrary to your point. I think you raise some good questions. I see so many people out there saying &quot;this is the truth, this is what is going on.&quot; I understand the desire to be that person that has the answers. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know where the path is going but only that we must walk it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, yea, christianity was fragmented in as many ways as possible and used in the name of evil to discredit it as much as possible. The old testament is written in parables and hebrew idioms to protect the true nature of its knowledge. If you take anything literal, youre just not wanting to see the truth.</p>

<p>The vatican has been linked to money laundering all over the world, pedophilia, drug smuggling, working with the mob, the list goes on. Of course the church is really bad. Christianity is fucked and prophecy isnt literal either. Doesnt change the many crucified christs before jesus and jesus himself or what he taught. I do believe that morality would fix the world.</p>

<p>Hitler didnt come to power to kill people just because he was a wild man on a long leash. People in power are hand selected, riiight? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, clearly we agree about a lot of things. </p>

<p>So maybe all of this press about the corruption of bankers is really a drive to dissolve them to create a One World Bank, just as Aliens could be used to create a catalyst for One World Government, maybe.</p>

<p>I believe that everything in this universe at some level is vibrational frequencies. Consciousness, physical matter, light and sound break down to math, that we as humans sort of understand, but don&#39;t have the complete picture yet. Our third dimension reality polarizes to positive and negative. So my conclusion is that if we are vibrations, then there are entities that exist at higher and lower frequencies than us, and that if there are forces of &quot;evil&quot; then mathematically there must be a force for &quot;good.&quot; </p>

<p>Either way, I think collectively we are on a path of evolution, spiritually, consciously or otherwise. We may have some dark times ahead, but there will be light somewhere. That&#39;s whole point isn&#39;t it, to experience life? </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t fight for what is right, and you hit the nail on the head, morality will save us. At least a sense of respect or responsibility for our fellow humans and this glorious beautiful earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government has control over media so when the media starts saying all the horrible shit going on and making people take notice of how horrible the government is, it&#39;s a trap. Of course it sucks. Ron Paul, Anonymous, galactic federation of wackos...they want you to see this and think it&#39;s the alternative. It&#39;s their alternative. They are destroying what they have built to bring about the nwo and a false messiah under the ruse that the population is actually getting what they want. </p>

<p>Definitely. I feel like everyone should strive to be positive and loving but pretending like evil will disappear because you dont wanna see it is nonsense.</p>

<p>Damn right, that&#39;s a good way of looking at it. You cant escape but youre not supposed to. Youre supposed to do the best you can and be who you are. Free of slavery, idolatry, and materialism to live with the earth as were meant to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think everything is controlled by the government, I would argue that most politicians are bought, but they couldn&#39;t buy everyone. </p>

<p>If evil is darkness, love is light, and I am a lamp. If I turn away from the darkness it creeps in behind my shade, filling the room with the nothingness. Unless I turn and face the darkness, then the nothing cannot exist, it is filled with my light. </p>

<p>Unless you have some secret knowledge, you cannot say anything to be truth. No one can. </p>

<p>Edit: Regarding the Galactic Federation, I think you could be right about it being a convenient alternative for a lot of people, however if they did actually exist then it would benefit the powers that be to have us afraid of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, that would undermine duality completely. There are good people in high places but even worse people control the core of government and the main representatives of it.</p>

<p>is evil darkness and love light though? Satan was the brightest light in heaven and he&#39;s a dick ass white guy. Why is everone of color basically killed and forced to suffer in order of how dark they are by comparison? It&#39;s funny how all this bullshit wisdom is based off duality but you can undermine it by picking one whenever you want to represent whatever you want. The universe is not so abstract that you can pick and choose what you want and exist in your own illusion. You have to work with everyone and everything to form reality.
I dont mean this in negativity towards you by any means. The lightworker shit is a joke though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry for using the word dick ass but either everything points toward satan being a blonde haired blue eyed man coming as a jew, calling himself jesus christ to combine all religions into a behemoth of a lie(The Galactic Federation of Light) or black people and real jews are evil and theres nothing pointing towards that besides racism. The less brown you get, the more chance you have at not being murdered. This is how it has always been. Im white and i grew up in a black ghetto and I&#39;m alive so im pretty inclined to believe that the people killing everyone arent black or brown. Theyre the same damn white people that rule the world in magazines, movies, video games, politics, etc. This is not racism, this is obvious. My girlfriend is white and has blonde hair and she isnt evil.</p>

<p>I understand the whole deal. I&#39;ve watched a lot of David Icke, David Wilcock, Julian Assange, etc but its bullshit. Not that i dont believe in a lot of what theyre saying but its such a joke. There are no aryan aliens coming to save mankind from government. They are the government. They are the men behind the cloak. They are the Atlantians. Theres no way around this. Either were living in a dream where nothing matters or everything that anyone has ever believed culminates in this. The aryan antichrist coming in flying saucers to rule the earth. It&#39;s already very apparent that there is a staged alien attack going to happen where theyve already picked the good and bad guys and are once again tricking us in to making a choice for &quot;good&quot;. Thats why we only get two choices from them. Republican or democrat. Reptilians or the antichrist. Its a joke. We shall see in due time how all this plays out but Yeshua/Jesus Christ and the God of all creation are the real opposition to this elaborate set up to enslave mankind. There are no other saviours which hold actual truth and stand for what should be obviously right in the world. Except the countless false messiahs who base their agendas far away from the truth.</p>

<p>Also, nothing can be proved or absolute until it is undeniably apparent but were not dealing in 100% facts. Only &quot;myths&quot; and &quot;legends&quot; but, to deny the truth is just pretending like the lie was never told. Everyone keeps telling us to wake up and see the lies. Well, i dont want to see the next &quot;reality&quot; made up for us, I want truth and this is about as close as it can get for me. All i want is to be proved wrong or right, but seeing as noone can convince me that the &quot;galactic federation of light&quot; is coming to save us from some other &quot;aliens&quot; they made up, what&#39;s left? seriously. What other alternative is there that isnt completely absurd?</p>

<p>The wrong <em>type</em> of government sucks, and democracy is disastrous failure given the ability of the 51% to dictate how the 49% are to live. As stated above, there are healthier alternatives.</p>

<p>Every aspect of media has been pushing the alien agenda lately and it seems pretty imminent.</p>

<p>Their job is to misinform and since people are afraid of aliens because they&#39;re unfamiliar with them it&#39;s easy to induce fear for the purpose of manipulation. Just another trick.</p>

<p>The bible was created for the sole purpose of empowering the sinister over the weak masses. No &quot;God&quot; thing &quot;cast&quot; out Satan; Satan is the ruler of the Hell that is our current state of the planet.

    <div class="md"><p>overview of Abrahamic religion as it appears to me...
Christianity represented as evil, fragmented, exploited and used against us because it should be used for us.
Mohammad was mentioned by jesus and also opposed the devil although, seems like Allah is another name of the devil and ruins the religion. Also, very confusing for me.
Judaism: Yeshua was Jesus Christs real name. He already came so Jews and christians are the same.
....skipping through the middle since i agree mostly, haha.</p>

<p>Some members of the illuminati: Waka Flocka, Justin Bieber, Wiz Kalifa...<br/>
alright man, these guys are about as enlightened as a bag of rocks. Illuminati double talk bs. Regardless of what they do, it made bullshit by the representers. Fuckin bitches, smokin weed, and gettin money arent the most noble of rap lyrics. Freemasons teach duality and obviously know some crazy shit. Seeing as our &quot;forefathers&quot;(as well as a shit load of other presidents and candidates(ron paul) are freemasons and they blow ass too, dont trust em? Everybody wants to wisper sweet little nothings in your ear and tell you everthing good theyre gonna do, not all the horrible shit.</p>

<p>so, you believe the &quot;alien&quot; thing is bs i take it? There is equal duality in the world and there is a creator. The spirit of everything that exists is made of god. You dont have to love people and be happy that you have a chance to live to begin with. You can also think that aryans are coming to save us by making us androids so we can live forever or some shit.
People really need to get over their god complex(EGO)! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They represent them in media nonetheless and they lay claim to it. They worship Apollo, the antichrist, the devil, whatever. the story doesnt change. If you worship apollo, Im not going to stop you. The lie of the Illuminati is still a fuckin joke as it always has been.
The elite lodges are all im referring to. Nothing on earth is completely good or evil but the guys at the top are the only ones that matter obviously. 
You have to understand that The Galactic Federation of Light are represented by the Illuminati and freemasons. They are the aryans. If your&#39;e an aryan, cant stop that i guess.</p>

<p>&quot;But what i am doing, I will continue to do so, that i may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting. For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as the apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.&quot; (2 corinthians 11:12-14)</p>

<p>Coming as a jew, with false apostles, will claim to be Jesus. He even has the 6 point star on his chest. The Romans still control us, not abrahamic religion. Jesus killed noone. Jesus was crucified for crimes he didnt commit by a corrupt roman empire. It was widely accepted that jesus was god so, the romans tried to make us think that we also love santa claus and all kinds of rediculous devil worship. They created the problem that the claim to be the solution for. He claims and denies that there is a heaven and a true god. There most obviously is, seeing as there is only one reason why the matrix of lies was created. To draw man away from morality, happiness, eternal life. If you feel like you deserve power over anyone, you are wrong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you totally disregard everything history has taught us about this and approve of Hitler&#39;s quest for the perfect aryan race, nothing. Smart people lie too. Especially when they know you&#39;ll believe it if youre uninformed. Revelations says there will be 3 1/2 years of supposed peace and the second half of that 7 years, the beast will show it&#39;s fangs. I&#39;m sure all of us have been duped by dumbass people we put our trust in, let alone the most evil force to ever exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, god didnt kill people in the name of christianity, a bunch of dicks that lived on earth did. The Roman Catholic church is worried about spreading real truth as much as theyre worried about everyone in africa dying. Also, seeing as lots of ancient cultures with apparent super technologies and &quot;higher spiritual understanding&quot;( pyramids, swazis, etc.)were all wiped out and didnt overcome their opposition, maybe they worshipped the devil too? They by no means were peaceful. They sacrificed people constantly and worshipped flying serpents. seems illogical to think that anyone has had it right yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and to claim that anyone does will always be utter nonsense. Also, aren&#39;t leaders responsible for their people? If God is the head of his church, shouldn&#39;t he be the one held responsible for the crimes of his church? Seeing as he is omniscient and omnipotent God has had the power to know and stop people committing crimes in his name. Why hasn&#39;t he? My point being he can&#39;t say he didn&#39;t know this was going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God isnt currently incarnated in a human body. Who would create everything in existance just to destroy it through a deeply seeded lie? Only a jealous disallusioned person could ever think that they could destroy god or even come close to being god. God isnt the Pope. </p>

<p>I definitely feel you on the whole &quot;why would you let this happen if you&#39;re god?&quot;. This world exists in this manner because of duality. Just as satan cant try to destroy god in a literal sense unless the time is right and the stars are aligned and so on, it goes the other way as well. There is an obvious seperation between how we operate on earth as people and how the stars operate so perfectly in the heavens. If heaven is &quot;heaven&quot; and it&#39;s the good in duality, then the earth was created on the other side. Good and bad are always at war but neither is destroyed. Seeing as god would have to be the supreme good, evil can be destroyed but good cant. It&#39;s futile to think that a mere slave to the game of the universe can ever make the rules or control the universe. </p>

<p>There are lodges that only the families of the elites can attend. Unfortunately, Freemasonry has been infiltrated by the elites (somehow, no one is sure how they did this, not even the Illuminati themselves) but that doesn&#39;t make the entire organization a corrupt bastion of conspiring.</p>

<p>Depends on what you mean. There is nothing but life in the universe.</p>

<p>Not some external unseeable force one must &quot;believe&quot; in. The creator is you, me and everyone else.</p>
