        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fellow renegades,</p>

<p>I have noticed a possible red flag indicator for the presence of shills and I wanted to share. You will probably come across evidence of this yourself (I will provide one sample below) so in the future when you see a user making reference to certain internet history they may now be unknowingly giving up the game on the true nature of their actions. Allow me explain. </p>

<p>Here is a quote taken from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rtr6b/a_very_interesting_insight_into_how_certain/">this thread</a> where a supposed ex-shill spills the beans on his work as a shill and extra information pertaining to the position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The site-specific info in the second binder included a brief history each site, including recent flame-wars, as well as info on what to avoid on each site so as not to get banned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we know from that that the files these people get when they start employment contain a summary/history of Reddit (presuming they were to be deployed here.) Now it would make sense that this file would make reference to the whole Reddit v Digg rivalry of old and encourage them to play on that in order to fit in with the crowd. Digg is the first link in the &quot;see also&quot; section on the Reddit wikipedia page so you would come across this easily when researching the site. It was at one time a very popular reference and a cheap dig at Digg (pardon the pun) would get you some easily earned upvotes and give you status as &#39;part of the team&#39; greatly easing your infiltration. I would think atheism is probably the buzz word of today. </p>

<p>I believe this to be a red flag because no regular user makes these references anymore, it&#39;s a total thing of the past only if we look <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/cuxparcrape">HERE</a> we can see this suspected military shill using the reference just 2 months ago. I have noticed this mentioning of Digg on two other occasions (the other two were a lot more randomly brought up) but unfortunately I didn&#39;t save the links for them. </p>

<p>The first post from the linked account was (wait for it) military related, contradicting an opinion voiced here that the training of the military through suburban areas could in fact be overt practice for the event of marshal law. When questioned they claimed to have come from Digg and then didn&#39;t use the account again after that.</p>

<p>Of course this is just my own theory so don&#39;t take it for stone though it is tied in to fact somewhat and to me it all seems likely/plausible. If anyone else here has other information on spotting shill accounts please share. The thread I linked also mentions some great information. I&#39;m aware this might seem a bit far fetched or looking too hard into things but I thought it was worth the mention.</p>

<p>TL;DR Certain Reddit specific words and references are encouraged and provided on file for use by shills and if you know what you&#39;re looking for they can be quite easy to spot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense. I have a recent hypothesis as well that involves the names of shill accounts.</p>

<p>Many names of accounts I&#39;ve suspected as shills have two random words in it that aren&#39;t that related. It seems like to make the account seem real, a lot of time must go into making up naming conventions, so if an account means something very specific and doesn&#39;t have to do with the internet/a geeky interest, it could also be a red flag. Seems more difficult though because some people just make names that are random.</p>

For at least 4 YEARS these same people have been saying the SAME thing day after day. </p>

<p>This same guy who pretends he&#39;s just having fun by trolling &quot;conspiratards&quot; had this really interesting conversation with an Imam doing an AMA over a year ago.  He provided a plethora of information and was extremely courteous to the imam, however jcm267&#39;s thesis  argument was Islam is NOT a religion of peace.  It went back and forth for quite sometime and appears extremely out of character for &quot;jcm267&quot;.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gvy09/iaman_imam_so_ama/c1qp0lg">Link to the Imam AMA</a></p>

What is your opinion on the treatment of Qurayza Jews?</p>

<p>It seems to me that Muslims are quick to speak out against slights against Muslims but don&#39;t make much noise to speak out against the evil that is done in the name of Islam. Do you agree with me here, and if so why or why not?</p>

<p>This web site lists passages that call for beheading of infidels. From what I understand these passages have not been abrogated. It seems that Islamists have a love affair with this form of &quot;punishment&quot; and that this practice is in accordance with their faith. True or not true?</p>

<p>What do you think of this picture? </p>

<p>Some may view this as an &quot;Islamophobic&quot; statement to make, but my understanding of Islam is that it was founded by a brutal medieval warlord. Am I wrong here?</p>

<p>Compared to other major world religions Islam seems much more violent. This article looks at Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It points to 324 (edit: 324 thousand) words devoted to political violence in the Islamic Trilogy, 34 thousand words devoted to political violence in the Hebrew Bible, and 0 worlds devoted to political violence in the (Christian) New Testament. Thoughts?</p>

<p>What do you think about the passages below? If they are out of context could you please explain?</p>

<pre><code>Muhammad&#39;s teaching on how to treat enemies:

    Infidels are your sworn enemies (Sura 4:101).
    Be ruthless to the infidels (Sura 48:29).
    Make war on the infidels who dwell around you (Sura 9:123, 66:9).
    Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day (Sura 9:29).
    Strike off the heads of infidels in battle (Sura 47:4).
    If someone stops believing in Allah, kill him (al-Bukhari 9:84:57).
    Take neither the Jews nor the Christians for your friends (Sura 5:51, 60:13).
    Never be a helper to the disbelievers (Sura 28:86).
    Kill the disbelievers wherever we find them (Sura 2:191).
    No Muslim should be killed for killing an infidel (al-Bukhari 1:3:111).
    The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger will be that    
</code></pre>

<p>they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land (Sura 5:33).</p>

<p>You yourself are simply an alt account of one of those users there anyway. I&#39;m not sure why you felt the need to post that manuscript as a simple sentence would have sufficed if your goal was to out jcm as a shill (and no I&#39;m not on his [or anyone for that matter&#39;s] side).

    <div class="md"><p>Was going to write two replies but why bother when it&#39;s you using both accounts anyway. Listen, I&#39;m not interested simply due to the nature in which you all haphazardly throw insults and engage in nothing but insipid smear tactics. Fair enough, what you point out about certain users has truth but the way in which you point these things out completely devalues your arguments. You are all freakishly obsessed over individual users as well, which further works against your arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I made an assumption there and I apologise. It was just how you chimed in after the mention of nolibswatch had me suspect that you&#39;re either an alt account or a lacky of LHOT. I shouldn&#39;t be so quick to jump to assumptions, especially as I try to set a standard of fact seeking (at least somewhat)! </p>

<p>I&#39;m subbed to enoughobamaspam already, it&#39;s a good message. The total shit storm in nolibswatch has me confused as to who&#39;s who (perhaps there&#39;s a good reason for that) I suggest if you&#39;re wanting to get people alongside then reducing the needless excessive slander from your and other&#39;s parts might help. But don&#39;t take advice from me, and none of this matters anyway, nice one for the eos sub though. Going camping tomorrow for a few days, I need a break from it all.</p>

<p>New theory: Everyone on Reddit that is obsessed with shills is in fact a shill trying to convince people that shills are everywhere so that we think that the mere mentioning of someone being a shill is preposterous. That way the real shills run free and avoid recognition.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>People on reddit say shit and stuff because there is more than one perspective on controversial topics. Shocking, it&#39;s almost like the definition of controversial rings true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok exclaiming shill when it&#39;s just down to a simple disagreement is petty and ridiculous and I haven&#39;t ever claimed for someone to be a shill apart from the military account listed in this thread and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/EvilObstructionism">this pro Obama account</a> that made the top of the front page on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (on their first and only post from an account just hours old.)</p>

<p>These are almost definites, they have a clear agenda behind their posts, they are created to enforce a specific agenda and then they are never used again (There are of course also the types constantly doing it) but Calling people a shill willy nilly is ridiculous and it irks me too but there are things we should be looking out for. Perhaps I got a bit carried away with my suspicions but I stand by the motives behind them.</p>

<p>P.S congrats on your first post in r/conspiracy, it&#39;s a great sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t doubt your suspicions in this case but then again sometimes it&#39;s just someone who has a political agenda too. I mean honestly it is not so hard to think someone could post something and never return again either. I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t look a bit weird but at the same time this is <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> we&#39;re talking about here. It can be hard to find anti-Obama accounts there. So if there are plenty of shills in politics they are in good company of people that just want to and will confirm their biases regardless. Seems like a strange place for for pro-Obama shills to be posting at the very least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it seems like the best place for them to post. It&#39;s one of the largest political forums on the internet, manipulating r/politic&#39;s user base has a massive initial and trickle-down effect. They have very active downvote brigades there for anything critical of Obama they sure as hell have people working to rig and manipulate its content too.</p>

<p>Your point doesn&#39;t seem very strong here. Think of it this way, everyone in the world knows of coca cola, most people love it and it&#39;s one of, if not the most recognised product in the world. Would they ever consider stopping advertising and promotion? Never.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay sure but honestly if you think of the demographics of reddit it&#39;s not a surprise that r/politics is very liberal. Obama already has plenty of willing advertisers there. I suppose you could argue that they would be the easiest audience to reach but if they have brigades as you say, why not take on other audiences that are neutral to him. That, to me, seems like the best place to target.</p>
