    <div class="md"><p>Wow, pretty much the most coldly hateful thing that I have ever seen on reddit. Homosexuality is a natural genetic mutation that occurs in nature. You should be aware that sexual reproduction only developed to increase a species&#39; ability to prosper. But now, with human species being the dominant species, and with our developed sense of reasoning and COMPASSION, we can understand that homosexual people are just like everybody else, with their own needs, wants, and beliefs. To say otherwise, is to ignore the voices of millions of people. In fact, the very technology that you are using was built upon the ideas of Alan Turing - a genius of his time who was persecuted for his sexual orientation. And the thing that you are asking for - to &quot;infect our kids environment ot change the way they think [sic]&quot; is to refuse CHILDREN the right to their own voice, their own decisions, and their own interpretation of the world. To do such a thing may be to remove the future of another possible genius while making children feel as if they are not really human. Shame on you OP for your bigotry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I Know I will likely get downvoted for this but I want to point something out. The genetic basis for homosexuality has not even come close to being proven by researchers. In fact it is more often dismissed out of hand by serious geneticists due to its absurdity. Genes are passed on through reproduction, If the gene in question is one that creates a state that by its nature strays from natural reproduction it will not perpetuate. Given in past days when people subverted their desires in order to blend into societal norms such a gene would have been passed on. However, as living a purely homosexual lifestyle has become more common and acceptable the numbers are increasing. This goes against reason. </p>

<p>Making the argument that it is a spontaneous genetic mutation is completely insane. The probability of the same random genetic mutation occuring all over the world across barriers of distance and race is statistically impossible.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that, without some unknown mutagenic element that results in this single common mutation this cannot happen in nature. I am not proposing that is the case. I am saying that all of the known facts of genetics precludes homosexuality from being a genetic predisposition. I do not say this to disparage anyone or out of some biggotry. I have none. To me people have a right to engage in any unharmfull consenting sexual self identity they so choose. The argument of genetic cause is just a pipe dream to shut up those who would accept no other justification for something the view as abhorent. An attempt to mount an unassailable defense if you will, but without substantial justification beyond the desire of those individuals for it to be so.</p>

<p>All of that asside the OP is a biggoted tool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna echo this post real quick-like since it is true that the science behind the genetic origin of homosexuality is indeed shaky and unconfirmed. However, I&#39;m of the disposition that, as beings capable of enjoying sexual <em>pleasure</em>, we can indulge ourselves in same-sex copulation since our species is <em>not</em> at risk of depopulation (&#39;cept maybe nuclear war, of course - don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you!). </p>

<p>What I do know is that sexual orientation, experience, and identity are all very fluid. They each influence the other and sometimes they change sub-consciously. Our ability to experience emotions (and especially those of others!) should induce compassion for those who are trying to reconcile their particular gender with their world around them. And if we just follow in Google&#39;s steps (<a href="http://bit.ly/MRGelr">http://bit.ly/MRGelr</a>), we&#39;ll do better as the universe`s phenonemon that we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great way to look at it. I fully agree. I personally think that it is, in a way, a sell out to say it is genetic.

<p>I will concede that it is possible that homosexuality is hormonal as opposed to genetic. The notion that it is a product of social conditioning however, is completely unsupported as far as I am aware. Further still, the idea that homosexuality is a choice by the subject is absured. </p>

<p>If you are aware of any studies that contradict this, please post them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we get cancer cells inside our bodies regularly. How a body responds to a threat may be weakened by the presence of a flu virus, or a lack of sufficient vitamins and minerals and it just may be that day that that cancer finds a good home to hang out in. There are so many internal wars that happen inside your body every day and sometimes luck is against you. And cancer isn&#39;t a gene. Nor are viruses, infectious bacteria, or hereditary diseases. Genes CAN be altered throughout one&#39;s lifetime (check out this on epigenetics, since it interests you so much: <a href="http://bit.ly/LbqWYo">http://bit.ly/LbqWYo</a>), but since human sexuality is such a fluid thing, it is much better to consider it as a spectrum in which everyone can be a little gay and a little straight, perhaps oscillating between the two (or not) over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With elaboration, you appear to be less ignorant than I have presupposed. Apologies for being angry, but I get fired up for gay rights, since they are regularly persecuted as a people. In response to your assertion that the environment (nurture) is the prime factor in determining a person&#39;s orientation, I ask you: &quot;When did you decide that you were straight? Did you always know?&quot; As a cisgendered fellow, I never realized that I had &quot;chosen&quot; to be attracted to women. And as a young kid growing up, and being told that I was &quot;gay&quot; or a &quot;faggot&quot; in school really questioned my orientation. So, you see? Environment does not play the singular factor because if it did, then I would have been convinced that I was a homosexual. Personal experience may not go far, but self-reflection might. Sexuality exists on a spectrum.</p>

Most conspiracy theories are just blind speculations by individuals that are then turned into &quot;facts&quot; after they scream it loud enough. Look at King Nutjob, Alex Jones.

<p>Fear has always been a tool used to control people. This isn&#39;t breaking news here. However, you can&#39;t just make up a theory, and say that just because you <em>think</em> it might be true that it is. </p>

<p>And if you ask me, the largest amount of fear I see comes from the conspiracy theorists, themselves. Look at Alex Jones, Glenn Beck, Ron Paul, etc. All of them scream that the sky is falling every single day, and their fan base eats that shit up. So if you want to talk about fear trying to control people, look no further than the sources you probably believe are credible. </p>

It&#39;s a joke for you to even say it. Also what&#39;s a credible source? Someone else&#39;s baseless opinions? Common since comes into play at some point doesn&#39;t it?

<p>Also what&#39;s a credible source? Someone else&#39;s baseless opinions?</p>

<p>Peer reviewed publications would be the top tier of credible sources. As for opinions, credible sources are usually void of opinions, but focus on the facts that are known. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ron Paul on the other hand is in no way any comparison with those too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is like a lightning pole for conspiracy nutters. His entire platform and his ideals are built around impending doom. Maybe he many not be a conspiracy nut himself (as in he doesn&#39;t believe the shit he says), but he sure as hell has found a way to make sweet, sweet money off of pandering to the nuts. </p>

<p>Go around <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and ask them who their favorite candidate is for President. I&#39;ll give you one guess whose name you&#39;d hear more than anyone else. Ron Paul also draws in the crowds of misogynists and racists. Check out some of the big posters here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. You&#39;ll find that in one post, they&#39;ll be crying about 9/11 or blaming the Jews for something, and then they&#39;ll find their way over to <a href="/r/ronpaul">/r/ronpaul</a> or <a href="/r/Libertarian">/r/Libertarian</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the least things I like about Ron Paul is his stance on 911 but it would be political suicide if he was honest about what really happened that day. His foreign policy and his freedom ideas is what I really like. It&#39;s not just r/conspiracy or r/ronpaul that you find support for paul but all over the internet, he pretty much owns it. If you think all conspiracies are just theory then I don&#39;t know what else to say but you probably shouldn&#39;t hang out in this sub unless you&#39;re just here to agitate people.</p>

You don&#39;t have any gay friends. If you did have gay friends, you would find NONE of them would say they &quot;turned gay&quot; at some point in their life. Did you turn straight at some point in your life? </p>

<p>Second, you either didn&#39;t read or failed to understand  the Op&#39;s comments. The Op is pondering the possibility there may be a way to influence sexual orientation in the womb via the use of hormones, chemicals, chemicals which influence hormone production...etc. As you are most likely aware, gay and lesbian couples lack the proper equipment to reproduce in what some might label, a conventional manner. A method of artificially influencing the sexual orientation of  the human fetus so the unborn child is predisposed to be homosexual would curb the growth of world population, Though, to stop the current population  explosion, my guestimate is less than 40% of the world population could continue to breed. A 60% homosexual population is something that might be noticed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love how you claim to be a liberal but bash liberals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>liberals can be wrong and do bad things. If you&#39;re looking at my comment history, I assume you&#39;re looking at my comment about wang-banger&#39;s propaganda work? Being a liberal doesn&#39;t mean I have to agree with what he does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>non-theist and bash other non-theists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>no actually i&#39;m just sickened by antitheists. atheists are perfectly fine on their own. In fact, my comments towards NukeThePope could just as easily be directed towards you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously, what is missing in your life that it drives you to interact with people like this?</p>

<p>John Snow dies at the end of A Dance with Dragons. He gets killed at the wall by his men for trying to forge a peace with the wildlings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there is some serious cognitive dissonance going on here. &quot;seriously, what is missing in your life that drives you to interact with people like this? BY THE WAY, DOUCHEBAG SPOILER ALERT.&quot; What are <em>you</em> missing? Did your parents not love you because you were an atheist and now you&#39;re a bitter and hateful antitheist?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already read aDwD. Most people seem to agree that it&#39;s a cliffhanger, but good shot at trying to shock me, asshole.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That...what? These people still existed. I think you&#39;re missing the point of this whole everything: Greeks didn&#39;t &quot;invent&quot; homosexuality. The Romans did not &quot;invent&quot; homosexuality. Homosexuality did not suddenly appear and signal the end of an empire. Human sexuality is far more fluid in its expression than many people in the present assume- gay, straight, and bisexual, and asexual are just a few of the equally valid and equally natural orientations human beings might consider themselves at any given time.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I think <em>you</em> should read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_ancient_Rome">this</a> before you claim that man-on-man-poundings began during the decline of the Roman Empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is a hypothesis...</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis</a></p>

<p><em>A hypothesis (from Ancient Greek ὑπόθεσις; plural: hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. The term derives from the Greek, ὑποτιθέναι – hypotithenai meaning &quot;to put under&quot; or &quot;to suppose&quot;. For a hypothesis to be put forward as a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words &quot;hypothesis&quot; and &quot;theory&quot; are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.</em></p>

<p>Also, i find it funny how you try to make it seem like i&#39;m racist in order to make your arguments more valid. Also, you might want to check on your grammar before calling other people stupid, it doesn&#39;t make you come across well.</p>

<p>The fact remains, you have literally no proof that homosexual tendencies were frowned upon by our ancestors, but are still certain that it was the case. Quite frankly, it&#39;s hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No homophobic tendencies here. I could care less what you think about my grammar, I&#39;m not writing a paper or book. So, do you really think it would of been excepted back in the day and it just recently became unacceptable? I personally don&#39;t give a rats ass if a man likes a man, this was not what the post was about. It&#39;s not natural or you would see it more often in the animal kingdom. Something within our environment is creating it, weather it be man made or nature. I guess I could see it being natural if nature was doing it to protect itself against our ever increasing population growth. Which is a serious problem to our way of life and to our planet. </p>

<p>If neo-nazis were in power, they&#39;d be offended if you questioned their ways.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabians can be greatly offended if you compare them to animals in any way, like &quot;You are strong as an ox.&quot;  That may make it unwise to say it, but doesn&#39;t mean you were any less correct that you would be if the person chose not to be offended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple of generalization and errors in your comment. 1) a vast majority of the gay population does not have &quot;the gay accent&quot;, 2) a huge amount of kids do purposly dress/act against the status quo on a daily basis just to &quot;not fit in&quot; and are therefor discriminated against. I actually believe it is a form of PTSD caused from a traumatic event that a child encounters during puberty. A few studies have touched on this and I know from first hand experience my gay friends have a very traumatic even that happened to tem during puberty. However, I care not to prove, &quot;cure&quot;, or end it. I personally think what a person does to their own body is up to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started with kinsey report</p>

<p><em>The Kinsey Report: How a Rockefeller Funded Study Laid the Groundwork For Today&#39;s Moral and Cultural Collapse</em></p>

<p><em>Essentially &quot;The Kinsey Report&quot; said that aberrant sexual behavior was so common as to be normal. Thanks to psychologist Dr. Judith Reisman, we now know that Alfred Kinsey was a homosexual and the &quot;Kinsley Report&quot; was a fraud.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2004/100804culturalcollapse.htm">http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2004/100804culturalcollapse.htm</a></p>

<p><em>Both of Kinsey’s most recent admiring biographers confessed he was a sadistic bi/homosexual who seduced his male students and coerced his wife, his staff, and the staff’s wives to perform for and with him in illegal pornographic films made in the family attic. Kinsey and his mates, Wardell Pomeroy, Clyde Martin, and Paul Gebhard, had &quot;front&quot; marriages, which concealed their strategies to supplant what they saw as a narrow procreational Judeo Christian era with a promiscuous &quot;anything goes&quot; bi/gay pedophile paradise. We now know Kinsey, for example, &quot;was deeply influenced by five pedophile headmasters who were quite clear they had very warm relationships with young adolescent boys of twelve or thirteen&quot; in one New England area. An early adherent and advocate of masturbation, Kinsey suffered an untimely death due, at least in part, to &quot;orchitis,&quot; a lethal infection in his testicles that followed years of sadistic, orgiastic &quot;self-abuse.&quot; Kinsey’s obsessive, brutally masochistic masturbation methods appear to have assisted in his early demise.  Kinsey solicited and encouraged pedophiles, at home and abroad, to sexually violate from 317 to 2035 infants and children for his alleged data on normal &quot;child sexuality.&quot; Many of the crimes against children (oral and anal sodomy, genital intercourse and manual abuse) committed for Kinsey’s research are quantified in his own graphs and charts
.......Kinsey’s closet team 1) &quot;forced&quot; subjects to give the desired answers to their sex questions, 2) secretly trashed three quarters of their research data, and 3) based their claims about normal males on a roughly eighty-six percent aberrant male population including 200 sexual psychopaths, 1400 sex offenders and hundreds each of prisoners, male prostitutes, and promiscuous homosexuals. Moreover, so few normal women would talk to them that the Kinsey team labeled women who lived over a year with a man &quot;married,&quot; reclassifying data on prostitutes and other unconventional women as &quot;Susie Homemaker.&quot;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.drjudithreisman.com/archives/regent.pdf">http://www.drjudithreisman.com/archives/regent.pdf</a></p>

<p><em>An effective foot soldier in the subjugation of the masses was the Rockefeller-funded Alfred C. Kinsey, the co-author of the highly influential Sexual Behavior In The Human Male, and other volumes. One technique of eugenics (selective breeding) and control is the destruction of traditional morality, and Kinsey may have accomplished more in that respect than any other man this century.</em></p>

<p><em>Kinsey studied at the Bussey Institution at Harvard in the 1920s (at the time a hotbed of eugenics research), then moved on to teach at Indiana University, where his work in cultural deconstruction would ultimately succeed in decimating American sexual mores, help to fragment the family, and would leave the population far more vulnerable to reproductive, cultural, familial, and mind programming.</em></p>

<p><em>Kinsey, always portrayed in the press as a wholesome &quot;leave it to Beaver&quot; style family man, was &quot;one of the scholarly eugenicists of pre-World War II&quot;, according to biographer James Jones. Kinsey recommended that a portion of the &quot;lower classes&quot; be sterilized to foster a more robust gene pool.</em></p>

<p><em>Among his intimates was Dr. Ewen Cameron, the infamous CIA-funded mind control doctor.</em></p>

<p><em>Another of Kinsey&#39;s influences was Dr. Herrmann Muller, one of his colleagues at Indiana University. Muller, who had begun receiving Rockefeller funding from the National Research Council in 1925, received a Guggenheim grant in 1932 to pursue his work in the genetics department of the Rockefeller-funded Kaiser Wilhelm Brain Resarch Institute in Berlin.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homosexuality has always been around. It should be a self-limiting problem: homos don&#39;t have babies, hence they should die off within a generation. But they don&#39;t. Nobody knows why homosexuality keeps emerging from the hetrosexual norm.</p>

<p>However, in past historical periods, not only in Western cultures but around the world, homosexuality has been strongly discouraged. Those who exhibited homosexual tendencies were ostracized, and this pressure was designed to force them to conform to the hetrosexual norm. Nobody decided to implement this censure. It was a reponse of the  group consciousness of the people as a whole, an instinct. We must assume that there is a reason for this rejection of homosexuality, even if we are not bright enough to figure out what the reason may be. We must assume that homosexuality was perceived by the human race as a whole as a danger to its survival.</p>

<p>Homosexuality has been almost universally rejected, except in very decadent cultures shortly before their collapse. Today, it is being embraced by a large percentage of the people, and this embrace is driven by ceaseless, relentless pro-homosexual propaganda.</p>

<p>This raises several interesting questions. Who is pumping out this propaganda, and why? Well, we know who controls our media. It is the Jews. Why would Jews wish to encourage homosexuality among Christians? Can it be a deliberate tool to weaken both Christianity as a religion, and white European culture? Are the Jewish leaders in Israel encouraging homosexuality among Jews in Israel?</p>

<p>If our culture is in a decadent phase, it may be that nothing can save it. However, if we believe that the downward spiral can be slowed, if not stopped, then the censure of homosexuality is one of the things that is necessary for slowing this decline.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is not tolerated in Islam. This may be one reason why Islam is destined to triumph over both Christianity and Judaism. It enforces codes of behavior that, in the long run, contribute to the survival of the culture, and the peoples under its rule.</p>

<p>Am I saying that Islam is good? No, of course not. It is  benighted and oppressive. But if Christians cannot defend themselves from the degeneration of white Christian culture, which is being encouraged and facilitated by Jews for their own purposes, it may be that Islam is inevitable. If Christians give up power over their own lives, a vacuum will be created, and another power will fill this vacuum. It won&#39;t be Judaism -- Jews want to exploit and destroy Christians, they don&#39;t want to convert them -- it will be Islam.</p>

<p>Am I saying that homosexuals should be beaten and killed? No, of course not. I am saying that if our Western civilization, which is a white Christian civilization, is to survive for much longer, homosexuality is one of the behaviors that must be discouraged and minimized in the culture. This is clear, historically.</p>

<p>That presupposes that homosexuals don&#39;t ever have sex with people of the opposite sex.  That&#39;s a mistake.</p>

<p>Much the same could be said of those who were left-handed.  Also, it&#39;s worth saying homosexuality was actually tolerated and, to a certain degree, celebrated in certain cultures such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece">ancient Greece</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Rome">ancient Rome</a>, and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit">Native American</a> culture.

<p>Must we?  That&#39;s a lot of assumption.  An appeal to antiquity is a weak argument, especially as it relates to the proto-evolution of morality.</p>

<p>[citation needed]  Also, that&#39;s ridiculous.  Both reform and orthodox Jews have been some of the loudest critics of gay rights.  I mean, I can offer citation, but I&#39;m pretty sure a cursory googling would confirm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If our culture is in a decadent phase, it may be that nothing can save it. However, if we believe that the downward spiral can be slowed, if not stopped, then the censure of homosexuality is one of the things that is necessary for slowing this decline.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually interested in this idea.  How does your context-less policing of what goes on in my bedroom prevent the decay of our culture?  Enlighten me, please.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Homosexuality is not tolerated in Islam. </p>

<p>You mean they horrifically murder my kind.  Yes.  I&#39;m aware.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if Christians cannot defend themselves from the degeneration of white Christian culture, which is being encouraged and facilitated by Jews for their own purposes, it may be that Islam is inevitable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Christians can&#39;t perpetuate their brand of &quot;the truth&quot;, then what does that say about their God?  Just a thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Am I saying that homosexuals should be beaten and killed? No, of course not. I am saying that if our Western civilization, which is a white Christian civilization, is to survive for much longer, homosexuality is one of the behaviors that must be discouraged and minimized in the culture. This is clear, historically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t be beaten and killed.  Thank you for that generous allowance.  How, praytell, should we best be oppressed then?  What should you do to minimize our so-called influence.  Is it enough to just verbally berate us?  Call us fags?  Dykes?  I&#39;m a personal fan of &quot;butt pirate.&quot;</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand why you think you have the right to minimize my humanity.  I just don&#39;t get why you think you have the right to enforce your morality on me.  You said earlier in your...whatever the hell you call your diatribe...that we&#39;ve always been around.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right.</p>

<p>We have.</p>

<p>And we will continue to be around, not because we&#39;re some disease you can&#39;t eradicate, but because we are an intrinsic part of the human experience.  Socrates, Plato, Oscar Wilde, Alan Turing.  Your precious culture and civilization wouldn&#39;t exist without our contributions.  There is no conspiracy here, or perhaps it&#39;s better to say that there is nothing nefarious here.</p>

<p>As a homosexual, I don&#39;t care about your approval.  I don&#39;t care about your opinion.  I don&#39;t need your support.  All I want is what I deserve: my humanity and my dignity.  No one deserves to take that away.  Not even in the name of defending Christian culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all, I&#39;d like to quantify homosexuality in the context of this conversation as a same-sex attraction, because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s being touted.</p>

<p>Next, I&#39;d like to note that the vast majority of the current scholarship produced by the psychological and psychiatric communities, starting with the work of Alfred Kinsey, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexual%E2%80%93homosexual_continuum">seem to indicate that sexuality isn&#39;t quite so polarized as we&#39;re discussing here.</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s literally mountains of research on the subject from Kinsey&#39;s pioneering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports">study</a> to the more recent work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_Sexual_Orientation_Grid">Fritz Klein</a> that supports the idea of a more fluid, dynamic expression of sexuality.</p>

<p>For instance: I identify as a gay male because the majority of my sexual attraction is geared toward other males.  Am I also attracted to women on occasion.  Hell yes!  That <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AxyFf.jpg">girl (NSFW)</a> from the frontpage on July 4th is STILL in the back of my mind, and yeah...I fapped to her.</p>

<p>Does that make me straight?  Hell no!  Bisexual?  Not especially.  That girl is hot, but I&#39;d still rather have sex with a hot guy.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make is that I think the vast majority of people are attracted to both genders at different points in their lives.  I think it&#39;s worth noting that most every argument AGAINST homosexuality is religious in nature.  Even the few secular arguments that homosexuality somehow defies the laws of nature are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals">woefully unfounded.</a></p>

<p>So these arguments are framed in such a way that sexuality becomes so very polarized.  You&#39;re either gay, or straight, or bi, or trans.  Or whatever.  I think the truth is that each individual has their own sets of dynamic attractions.  Maybe they&#39;re more heterogenous or more homogenous, but I don&#39;t think policing these attractions really profits anyone anything.</p>

<p>I guess at the end of the day, you ask me &quot;Why homosexuality?&quot;</p>

<p>At the risk of being trite, I think I must answer &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>Nobody decided to implement this censure. It was a reponse of the group consciousness of the people as a whole, an instinct. </p>

<p>Wow. Go read some history books while you&#39;re at it. The Romans didn&#39;t give half a fuck about &quot;censuring&quot; homosexuality. They didn&#39;t even recognize the modern concept - their view of sexual preference was tops vs. bottoms. Roman men we&#39;d put on the straight end of the Kinsey scale would think nothing of getting a blowjob from another man, but would sooner eat shit than pussy. </p>
