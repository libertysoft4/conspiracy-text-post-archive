<p>Selling your soul to the devil? Propaganda in itself. I&#39;ve the eye of lucifer represented inside of an ouroborous dragon tattooed on my leg. It represents knowledge, and the sadness that accompanies many of the great truths of our world. To consider the trade off between knowledge and happiness is where the christian belief comes from, and the backlash that accompanied the dark ages only propagated this opinion.</p>

<p>This is a really good example of what I am talking about.</p>

<p>What the fuck is this sentence even saying? Can you back this up with anything? Does this go for people who are not Christian? Would a Hindu or a Sikh suddenly believe in the devil? What about buddhists? </p>

<p>&quot;The most infamous of them all&quot; in this case seems to refer to &quot;devil worshippers&quot;. No one would just randomly say someone was the most infamous of them all without referring back to what it is they mean...</p>

<p>This is an example of how you are lying/changing facts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The point behind all of this is not your misinformed opinion, it is your willful ignorance, earlier in the thread (and still), where you decided you did not need to read Crowley to fully condemn him as a &quot;devil worshiper&quot;. </p>

<p>It was a suggestion. Dont get all defensive. If you want to stay and debate with someone with small minded idiocy as me, sure. If that benefits you more than starting your own post, which I dont see how, then sure. </p>

<p>Wow. You have got to be the stupidest person I have ever encountered in my entire life. I mean that. Rather than actually research source material, you think it is OK to just randomly paraphrase other &quot;research&quot;.</p>

<p>If you are going to cite something to back up a claim, then yes, you have to offer evidence. This is basic stuff dude.</p>

<p>I never said that. I said, repeatedly, that I actually read stuff. You said, repeatedly, that you don&#39;t need to. Intellect has nothing to do with it, unless you mean the raw brain power it takes to read a book.</p>

What was your point?</p>

<p>To make an enemy out of me? Well, you&#39;ve done it. One wonders how you&#39;re going to make anyone agree with your viewpoint by putting them down. Have you noticed I haven&#39;t insulted you personally? Work on your people skills man, then more people will like you and appreciate your opinions meanwhile.</p>

<p>You are in fact the stupidest person I have ever encountered. Why do I believe this? Because you said something that was not true. You were then told it was incorrect. You then claimed you were somehow exempt from having to do your own god damn research. </p>

<p>You refuse to educate yourself about Crowley, but cite him as an example of the foundations of your question. Your question is stupid. Your refusal to accept that you might be wrong is stupid. You, are stupid. </p>

<p>I believe in the charkra system. Infinite points that connect your body and soul, with 7 main ones. Top to bottom wisdom, knowledge, communication, love, power, change, existence. Everything you do is a transfer of energy between these points. Love is the center. I believe that lack of love is evil.  </p>

<p>I feel that when you are working with love you are using 7 and that is perfect. But if you work without love you are using 6. Which is imperfect.</p>

<p>I feel that the number of the beast is 666 because 6 is imperfect 66 is more imperfect and 666 is the most imperfect. I feel the beast represents our money system because it exists without love.</p>

<p>I feel selling your soul to the devil is pledging yourself to this system</p>

<p>You do understand that there are documented satanic worshipers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show me. Are you talking about the Church of Satan? They claim up and down that they are using Satan as a metaphor. Or do you mean &quot;devil worshipers&quot; who are teenagers, high on television, who think that some kind of satanic seance is going to bring them girls and beer? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think Christians exist, do you think the opposite doesn&#39;t?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Find me reference to the Devil in the hebrew of the old testament. You can&#39;t. He isn&#39;t there. &quot;Satan&quot; is from the hebrew &quot;ha satan&quot;, which translates as &quot;the accuser&quot;. There was no devil until Christian leaders invented him and retroactively pressed him into the mythos. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And refrain from calling other people&#39;s opinions idiocy, yours isn&#39;t any 
better. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mine is informed. Yours is misinformed. You have not read the source material (RE: crowley) but you make claims. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being atheist doesn&#39;t make you anymore smarter than anyone, nor not believing the devil. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not atheist, I am agnostic. The devil is a character in a book, who was not even in the prequel. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think we just popped outta nowhere from dust, or whatever science tells you? Yes, that is definitely more believable...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is far more believable if you have taken time and weighed the evidence. I am assuming you have never studied science or any of the evidence of evolution, or the size of the universe. There is no Christian God. This is a simple fact to arrive at if you actually use your brain and do your own research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So please, refrain from thinking your thinking is not idiocy either</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am always willing to be wrong, to change my opinion, and to grow. </p>

<p>As a Christian, it is you who can&#39;t handle change or facts that challenge your worldview.</p>

<p>Mountains of evidence for evolution. The number of times the Christian church has been wrong (gravity, geocentric theory, space, race, sexuality). Quantum physics. The gospel of Thomas and the rest of the Gnostic Gospels. The creation of the Vulgate. There are over 36,000 denominations of a religion dedicated to &quot;one&quot; god. The complete lack of contempory references to anything in the Jesus myth. The fact that lesser gods in the middle east had already: walked on water, turned fishes and loves into enough to feed 5000, healed the sick, raised the dead, and been crucified and returned from the dead. </p>

<p>Good point. However you use a lot of buzz words (your conception of Crowley, for instance) that are lifted directly out of Christianity.</p>

Make your own post for someone who cares instead of calling others stupid for not agreeing. You seem like one of those people who think the truth for them is the truth universally. It isn&#39;t.

<p>I called you stupid for refusing to research direct sources, not for having an opinion. You can have whatever opinion you want, but remaining willfully ignorant is just fucking idiotic. </p>

<p>No, I just happen to know 1. that you don&#39;t know anything about Crowley, and 2. you claim you don&#39;t need to/don&#39;t want to actually read Crowley. </p>

<p>This has nothing to do with my truth or your truth, it has to do with your willful ignorance.</p>
