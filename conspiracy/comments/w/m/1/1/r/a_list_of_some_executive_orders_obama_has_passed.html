I did find a site that talks about Obama&#39;s EOs and follows his time in presidency, check it out <a href="http://1461days.blogspot.com/">http://1461days.blogspot.com/</a>
(I am not apart of that site at all, and just randomly found it from google)</p>

<p>Here are some from Obama: </p>

<p>Executive Order 10995: All communications media will be taken over by federal authority: radio, 
television, websites, newspapers, even CB and Ham radio systems. Freedom of expression, otherwise 
known as the 1st Amendment, will be canceled til further notice. [Emergency Broadcast System / FEMA] </p>

<p>Executive Order 10997: All fossil fuels, related substances as well as all electrical power, both corporate 
as well as privately owned devices and generators will be seized by the federal government. </p>

<p>Executive Order 10998: Allows the seizure of all food, the means to produce food and related products 
and machinery, warehouses and cooperatives; including corporate and private farms, by the government. 
You will not be allowed to hoard food since this is regulated.  Hoarding is defined as anything beyond a 
two-week supply. 
[If you are caught hoarding food, you could be shot dead, or perhaps you will be lucky enough to be 
tazed, knocked to the ground, sent to a FEMA camp and be immediately classified as a “domestic 
terrorist”, otherwise known as an “Enemy of the State”.] </p>

<p>Executive Order 10999: All transportation will be placed under complete government control including 
private vehicles, control of all mass transit hubs &amp; seaports will be seized. [Transportation Security Act] </p>

<p>Executive Order 11000: All civilians will be drafted into forced labor at various designated work-sites or 
camps under federal supervision. [AR210-25, ‘Civilian Inmate Labor Program’] </p>

<p>Executive Order 11001: Allows the federal government to take over all health, welfare, and educational 
functions.  Health &amp; welfare functions would relate to matters involving an outbreak or epidemic of a 
highly communicable disease. </p>

<p>Executive Order 11002: A national registration of all human beings.  This may involve the mandatory 
implantation of a microchip identification/tracking device.  [Ref. 2010 CENSUS] </p>

<p>Executive Order 11003: Allows the government to take over all airports and seize any aircraft, including 
commercial aircraft. </p>

<p>Executive Order 11004: Allows the government to relocate communities, build new housing, designate 
areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.  [Ref. HR 645] </p>

<p>Executive Order 11005: Allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways, and storage 
facilities. </p>

<p>Executive Order 11049: Assigns emergency preparedness functions to federal departments and agencies, 
consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period. </p>

<p>Executive Order 11051: Specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives 
authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and
economic or financial crisis. </p>

<p>Executive Order 11310:  Gives authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in 
Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all 
aliens, to take control and operate all state correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11490: Consolidates control over more than a dozen previous EO’s including #10997, 
10998, 10999, 11000, 11001, 11002, 11003, 11004, 11005, 11087, 11088, 11089, 11095, and 11310. </p>

<p>With all this shit being passed, can we have an intelligent discussion on the following points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would he pass these now? Why have no other presidents signed these before him?</p></li>
<li><p>What should be the plan of action for when he starts to act upon these orders?</p></li>
<li><p>How can executive orders be removed?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Why all of this massive preparation that seems aimed either at major war, major depression, or a police state. There is NO good reason to have this huge assumption of authority, at this time. But if you couple this with the massive upsurge of drones over the US, and the endless overseas wars which the population cannot stop, you can guess which of the three aims is likely,</p>

<p>I refute the right of this president to impose all of this, and if EO 11002 comes to require a forced implantation of a chip, I reject that. 11002 seems to be revival of the National ID scheme that&#39;s been fought already.</p>

<p>Fight for freedom, it&#39;s precious and it&#39;s being taken away.</p>

<p>Something really drastic will occur soon. It will be global.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much agree. The agendas being pushed in the highest places have nothing to do with the rights of the people or their welfare, and everything to do with consolidating power in a few hands globally. If we cannot stop this, and if we cannot demand accountability from our corrupt government, then the future is bleak.</p>

<p>It is very likely that global finance is being allowed to fail in order to bring down entire economies and thereby open the means for removing democracy, and instituting a global police state. In the process, many will end up dying, but that meets the needs of the elite. Some say, why would they kill off their customers? One answer is, they already have enough wealth that they don&#39;t need us, and we are just useless resource consumers they want out of the way.</p>

<p>I fear that things are very much getting close to a major transition, an evil one. Many of you have a gut feeling something bad is coming. I believe that is correct. I wish I knew how we could combat this, but the dark forces are well infiltrated. We must find a way to buy time to fight this.  In the bad times to come, don&#39;t give up. but don&#39;t be foolish either.  Finally, knowledge is one weapon; spread what you find is truth, fight lies, and resist crime and corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What they don&#39;t realize yet is that they will fail. Not to say it will be bloodless or easy, Because it won&#39;t. It will be brutish and nasty.</p>

<p>But they live in a flawed model that is at odds with decency and how the universe actually is supposed to work. Darwinism is a handy tool to understand war and competition for resources.  There is another model however, one of cooperation, coexistence, love and compassion.</p>

<p>When one looks at what strategy is likely to succeed over time while bringing the most benefit and growth, it is not competition or war.</p>

<p>It is the opposite. Love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a response I can appreciate.</p>

<p>Yes, at times, on certain matters, I can get obscene in language. Not ideas I hope.</p>

<p>It is because I was trained early as a warrior. To fight.</p>

<p>And with the absurdity of some things, I get angry.</p>

<p>My ingrained training raises the hormone levels, flight or FIGHT.</p>

<p>While I have perhaps intellectually moved past that, there are times I can not. During those periods of frustration and anger I can resort to foul language. And foul disposition. I have been on the road to &quot;truth&quot; a very long time, not something most wish to try to partake in.</p>

<p>It gets very old seeing the same mistakes over and over again.</p>

<p>While Jesus may weep over lost souls and misunderstood teachings, I, as an ex soldier, am more old testament. It makes me furious.</p>

<p>It&#39;s something I fall short on and try to improve.</p>

<p>If we are brothers that follow similar paths, and I sense we are... Hello.</p>

<p>I am sorry if my shortcomings negatively impacted you.</p>

<p>I have been internally broken since 9/11 and our wars.</p>

<p>I spend more focus on being aware and less on being polite.</p>

<p>After all, our enemies, of many sorts are not nice fellows.</p>

<p>I default to cynical and bitter on some subjects. Which sucks really.</p>

<p>BTW, what is your current area of focus here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To try and stay educated about real conspiracies, and hope that people can move on from the obvious bullshit theories (reptilian theory, etc)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are you trying to engage and enlighten others on? Besides being polite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That there are conspiracies, but not <em>everything</em> is a conspiracy. It&#39;s a side people hate, and not many agree with, but it&#39;s how I feel about it. I think there are <em>some</em> things that can be best described by Hanlon&#39;s Razor.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived a life of being ridiculed for my belief in government cover-ups and conspiracies, and when I see people who (to me) make everyone who believes in real conspiracies look like nutjobs, it really irks me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand that completely.</p>

<p>What I would mention is that while it is certainly true that the pen is mightier than the sword... As it should be...</p>

<p>The sword does have it&#39;s place and is never pretty.</p>

<p>And it is normal for the user of the pen to be revolted by the wielder of the sword. Reality dictates we need both at some points.</p>

<p>Try to focus on the goals of my mission. I&#39;ll do the same for you. I gather they are the same.</p>

<p>Let us both recognize the need for both. Much like political government and military force each play a part.</p>

<p>The point is, as you likely know and apparently pointed out, each have a place and are needed.</p>

<p>Can each do better toward a common goal?</p>

<p>Absolutely my brother. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Comments like this. I was making a joke - you see it pretty frequently in this sub.. Where people will say &quot;Something big is going to happen...soon&quot;</p>

<p>You just don&#39;t have to be rude to <em>everybody</em> to get your point across, that&#39;s all I was trying to say to you in that regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much of this stuff is new to me. Some is not.</p>

<p>Based on the new stuff, I honestly believe something will happen soon.</p>

<p>And it is not as simple as a Mayan calendar, biblical prophesies or the disintegration of modern militaristic society.</p>

<p>I sense something more profound. I easily could be wrong.</p>

<p>But I wasn&#39;t wrong on 9/11, the wars and a devolution to the police state.  From day one.</p>

<p>So I tend to listen to my inner intuitions. Even when they are painful, lonely and the cause of furious anger.</p>

<p>I guess I feel that someone must be on guard. Ready to be rude and shout &quot;halt!&quot; I wish that guy was not me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the rude part completely. I have even explained my poor rationale for it. Moving on to something happening soon...</p>

<p>If you had asked me 2 months ago, I would have responded just like you. For many years I felt the same.</p>

<p>I considered it absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>So let me offer my personal experience on this here.</p>

<p>It has happened to me before. I read, saw, researched and understood many things quickly after 9/11. What I understood was insane to the common man/women I knew in all my circles.</p>

<p>The same was true for Iraq, and to a lesser extent, Afghanistan. The economic collapse. Birth of the police state. Yet my compass was always true. It picked these things up and gave direction. The chatter, info and sources that led me to see a different world than most, at the time, that was accurate.</p>

<p>For the first time since then, I sense a very similar thing going on.  Can I post it here and illuminate it clearly for all and make awakening occur? Likely no, just as with 9/11 and middle eastern wars. I did try at the time.</p>

<p>I know there is a lot of bullshit around 2012.</p>

<p>But. My spidey sense is screaming. Once again.</p>

<p>Believe what you will.  I am concerned greatly. It is from hours upon hours of reading and digesting.  Just like before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m saying - is just the message being so vague is what&#39;s mocked. I apologize if it seemed I was judging <em>you</em> at all, I really was only concerned with the way you approach your comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, we all have our parts to play.</p>

<p>Brash or not. As long as it is being thrown about, it is productive and useful.</p>

<p>It drives discussion.</p>

<p>Politeness is no longer my primary concern. That would be very naive.</p>

<p>While I respect gentle approaches, I also see where they fail.</p>

<p>So I augment them.  Provide heavy handed security. A dose of blowback.</p>

<p>Yes, like Ghandi, Jesus, Budda, Confucius and Mohammed... There are enlightened academic paths to righteousness. They lead the way.</p>

<p>There is also the reality of the struggle to get there. To actually win battle instead of just stating why there is conflict. Unlike them, some must be foot soldiers with bayonets. Thrusting.</p>

<p>Even good has it&#39;s yin and yang. How could it be different?</p>

<p>Idealism can not just be ideas. Or it is useless in practicality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got that long ago. Did you get any of what I said about that?</p>

<p>Because it is just as important. If not more so.</p>

<p>Make no mistake this is a war of ideas.</p>

<p>While we absolutely need analysts with calm voices and minds, we also need other types of strength and abilities.</p>

<p>War is never fair nor lovely.  And this is a war. Of ideas, values and truths.</p>

<p>Good versus evil. Wrong versus right. Decency versus indecency.</p>

<p>You expect it to be bloodless and bleached white?</p>

<p>Nope. It will play out ugly. </p>

<p>Why are you surprised to see a damaged warrior fighting for truth and good leaving no holds barred? Imperfect as he may be.</p>

<p>Maybe I am misunderstanding your depth of understanding here. If so, I am sorry.</p>

<p>But realize, my gloves came off long ago. I no longer feel the need to respond to indecency decently.  Get it?</p>

<p>Alas, I am, but I&#39;m also not spelling out doom with my comments. Being vague isn&#39;t the issue, it&#39;s being vague when blindly stating <em>I think something is going to happen</em> that starts to be ridiculed, is all I&#39;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting that not one single source of criticism on the web of EO11002, out of the many I&#39;ve seen, links to any EO text besides the Kennedy one, and it appears there is no information anywhere directly pointing to Obama signing of EO11002. I will have to dig deeper on this, as none of the large number of articles on EO11002 actually cite a verifiable federal signing by Obama.</p>

<p>Also, all EOs signed by Obama are in the 13000 series of numbering and none are 11xxxx.</p>

<p>I also see claims Obama has signed over 900 EOs, and that number is bogus. So something&#39;s not right in all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Executive orders are numbered sequentially and don&#39;t repeat. The only EO 11002 there is is the one Kennedy signed. If a new President wants to &#39;own&#39; an Order his predecessor gave, he reissues it as a new order with whatever tweaks he wants and signs it. The &#39;No assassinations&#39; order gets treated like this, new President signs a new one even though the old one is in place. I <strong><em>think</em></strong> the 11002 claim is bullshit, but if there&#39;s an out that can make the story, it&#39;s probably something along those lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent the last bit reading these executive orders.  The synopses accompanying each order in the original post are taking significant liberties when interpreting the words of the order.  My favorite is the summary of Executive Order 10998.  The OP went overboard: no mention of individual stockpiling of food is mentioned, let alone the size or duration of a &quot;hoard,&quot; or any action that may be taken against citizens storing food.</p>

<p>There&#39;s trippy stuff in these orders, but the OP is far from credible.  Makes it difficult to have constructive conversation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the section you&#39;re talking about. Most of the previous text deals with them prioritizing contracts already entered in to, and getting emergency funds to buy needed things. Here&#39;s the thing. It&#39;s just setting rules for it. This power already exists and has since the founding of our country. Hell, you&#39;re even probably familiar with it on a small scale. How many cop shows/movies have you seen where an officer in pursuit of a suspect has to commandeer a car? </p>

<p>In WW2 the US government took over factories and turned them into military production. It also controlled distribution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tires were the first item to be rationed by the OPA, which ordered the temporary end of sales on 11 December 1941 while it created 7,500 unpaid, volunteer three-person tire ration boards around the country. By 5 January 1942 the boards were ready. Each received a monthly allotment of tires based on the number of local vehicle registrations, and allocated them to applicants based on OPA rules.[4]:133 The War Production Board (WPB) ordered the temporary end of all civilian automobile sales on 1 January 1942, leaving dealers with one half million unsold cars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Civilians first received ration books—War Ration Book Number One, or the &quot;Sugar Book&quot;—on 4 May 1942,[7] through more than 100,000 schoolteachers, PTA groups, and other volunteers.[4]:137 A national speed limit of 35 miles per hour was imposed to save fuel and rubber for tires.[5] Later that month volunteers again helped distribute gasoline cards in 17 Atlantic and Pacific Northwest states.[4]:138 To get a classification and rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local War Price and Rationing Board which reported to the OPA (which was jokingly said to stand for &quot;Only a Puny A-card&quot;). Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and small children who qualified for canned milk not available to others. To receive a gasoline ration card, a person had to certify a need for gasoline and ownership of no more than five tires. All tires in excess of five per driver were confiscated by the government, because of rubber shortages. An A sticker on a car was the lowest priority of gasoline rationing and entitled the car owner to 3 to 4 gallons of gasoline per week. B stickers were issued to workers in the military industry, entitling their holder up to 8 gallons of gasoline per week. C stickers were granted to persons deemed very essential to the war effort, such as doctors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of 1 March 1942 dog food could no longer be sold in tin cans, and manufacturers switched to dehydrated versions. As of 1 April 1942 anyone wishing to purchase a new toothpaste tube had to turn in an empty one.[4]:129-130 Sugar was the first consumer commodity rationed, with all sales ended on 27 April 1942 and resumed on 5 May with a ration of one half pound per person per week, half of normal consumption. Bakeries, ice cream makers, and other commercial users received rations of about 70% of normal usage.[7] Coffee was rationed nationally on 29 November 1942 to one pound every five weeks, about half of normal consumption, in part because of German U-boat attacks on shipping from Brazil.[10] By the end of 1942 ration coupons were used for nine other items.[4]:138 Typewriters, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, Silk, Nylon, fuel oil, stoves, meat, lard, shortening and oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies, and fruit butter were rationed by November 1943.[11] Many retailers welcomed rationing because they were already experiencing shortages of many items due to rumors and panics, such as flashlights and batteries after Pearl Harbor.[4]:133</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are perfectly legitimate reasons for the government to step in and control distribution. If it&#39;s less then a fucking world war, I&#39;ll be right there with you throwing a level 20 shitstorm. But I&#39;m not going to pretend like its outrageous to have a procedure in place if it needs to happen.</p>

<p>Most of that order sets up Presidential Advisory boards and tells agencies what they can buy and who they can hire during a disaster or conflict.</p>

<p>This means that you <strong>are</strong> a part of that site. &quot;Apart&quot; means separate. So, that sentence says you are not separate. You want &quot;<em>a part</em>&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the rude part completely. I have even explained my poor rationale for it. Moving on to something happening soon...</p>

<p>If you had asked me 2 months ago, I would have responded just like you. For many years I felt the same.</p>

<p>I considered it absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>So let me offer my personal experience on this here.</p>

<p>It has happened to me before. I read, saw, researched and understood many things quickly after 9/11. What I understood was insane to the common man/women I knew in all my circles.</p>

<p>The same was true for Iraq, and to a lesser extent, Afghanistan. The economic collapse. Birth of the police state. Yet my compass was always true. It picked these things up and gave direction. The chatter, info and sources that led me to see a different world than most, at the time, that was accurate.</p>

<p>For the first time since then, I sense a very similar thing going on.  Can I post it here and illuminate it clearly for all and make awakening occur? Likely no, just as with 9/11 and middle eastern wars. I did try at the time.</p>

<p>I know there is a lot of bullshit around 2012.</p>

<p>But. My spidey sense is screaming. Once again.</p>

<p>Believe what you will.  I am concerned greatly. It is from hours upon hours of reading and digesting.  Just like before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got that long ago. Did you get any of what I said about that?</p>

<p>Because it is just as important. If not more so.</p>

<p>Make no mistake this is a war of ideas.</p>

<p>While we absolutely need analysts with calm voices and minds, we also need other types of strength and abilities.</p>

<p>War is never fair nor lovely.  And this is a war. Of ideas, values and truths.</p>

<p>Good versus evil. Wrong versus right. Decency versus indecency.</p>

<p>You expect it to be bloodless and bleached white?</p>

<p>Nope. It will play out ugly. </p>

<p>Why are you surprised to see a damaged warrior fighting for truth and good leaving no holds barred? Imperfect as he may be.</p>

<p>Maybe I am misunderstanding your depth of understanding here. If so, I am sorry.</p>

<p>But realize, my gloves came off long ago. I no longer feel the need to respond to indecency decently.  Get it?</p>
