        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So here&#39;s a quote from his expressly satanic book &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot;, a book that begins with the words &quot;I have written this book to help the Banker, ..&quot;.</p>

<p>There is an illustration of some kind with this written under it: &quot;The Banker should discover the real meaning of his existence, the real motive which led him to choose that profession.  He should understand banking as a necessary factor in the economic existence of mankind, instead of as merely a business whose objects are independent of the general welfare.  He should learn to distinguish false values from real, and to act not on accidental fluctuations but on considerations of essential importance.  Such a banker will prove himself superior to others; because he will not be an individual limited by transitory things, but a force of Nature, as impersonal, impartial and eternal as gravitation, as patient and irresistible as the tides.  His system will not be subject to panic, any more than the law of Inverse Squares is disturbed by Elections.  He will not be anxious about his affairs because they will not be his; and for that reason he will be able to direct them with the calm, clear-headed confidence of an onlooker, with intelligence unclouded by self-interest and power unimpaired by passion.&quot;</p>

<p>This clearly shows the mentality of the international bankers and maybe hints at demonic possession. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also thought Crowley was hinting at this.</p>

<p>Yes, Crowley is a great example of an extremely intelligent and potentially influential author/occultist that it might worry the elite. Think about this...</p>

<p>We all have some sort of memory or intuition of &#39;magick&#39; or what magick is. The fact that the concept of magick has been around for so long is nothing to scoff at.  However, when we go to the movies and see some character shoot fireballs out of his hand and call it magic, the distant memory of knowing magick intuitively is lost and replaced by an image of a ridiculous idea that can&#39;t possibly happen, even in the realm of magick. The campaign against Crowley and ideas derived from his writings is blatantly obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was at a convention once where Crowley was being discussed. It seemed that everyone, for and against, actually thought Crowley believed in what he was doing literally. I tried to explain that Crowley himself said he was an Atheist.</p>

<p>A very crude oversimplification would be that Crowley&#39;s system of &quot;magick&quot; is an exhaustive collection of physical and mental exercises designed to generate an altered state of consciousness. His pantheon of metaphors is simply that... metaphors. Designed in a very specific way to illicit a specific response.</p>

<p>I was mostly agreeing with Yurphurp about sarcasm in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only had this subreddit frontpaged for a few days but I&#39;m surprised at the lack of context and rationality. I&#39;m really quite surprised anyone takes a fungible conspiracy seriously. ( i.e. <em>all</em> of the bankers... there&#39;s no <em>all</em> of anything to blame)</p>

<p>To get back to Crowley though... first I think his commentary on bankers is probably satire, second you have to take the whole of western society at that time into account to understand the actions or opinions of any one player.</p>

<p>The one good thing to come out of British imperialism at the turn of the century was the processing of all new information from throughout the world by the universities of the British Isles. How this new information, new art, and new perspectives was digested by the western world informed an entire generation of thinkers and artists.</p>

<p>James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Pablo Picasso, Frank Loyd Wright, Alfred Korzybski, Wilhelm Reich, Nikola Tesla, Carl Jung, Aleister Crowley all came up at about the same time and were trying to wrap their heads around all of this new information. They all interacted in various ways and influenced each other. Aleister Crowley&#39;s opinion on bankers was surely not his alone.</p>

<p>The important contributions of Pound and Crowley are their intimate understanding of Asian culture and how it informed their work. Crowley&#39;s system incorporated as much Sufi tradition and Yoga as he traced the modern magical orders back through time to locate their origins.</p>

<p>Ezra Pound&#39;s contributions to the work of Ernest Fenollosa almost singlehandedly redefined the western world&#39;s understanding of the Asian world. If you&#39;ve ever enjoyed a haiku then you owe it mostly to these two men.</p>

<p><em>The Cantos Of Ezra Pound</em> is going to become a great Rosetta Stone by which East and West will begin to better learn about each other. Learning to bring your own consciousness under control and helping to clear the mind of emotional compulsions would be Crowley&#39;s contribution.</p>

<p>Or something like that... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analysis of this passage is not only clouded with preconception, but also patently false.</p>

<p>First of all, Crowley is stating that in order for any of us, INCLUDING a &quot;banker&quot;, to reach our full potential, we must be free of self interest (ego).</p>

<p>He describes the function of a banker in the context of being an integral part of modern societies infrastructure development, and that to consider ones self otherwise, is to see one&#39;s self as &quot;Through a glass darkly&quot; if you will.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t realize is that many times, Crowley comes off as &quot;expressedly Satanic&quot;, purposefully.</p>

<p>It was a ruse to deflect the weak-minded from discovering that he was an adherent to the true and original Christianity of the Church of Jerusalem (as were the Templars, and are the modern Freemasons), before the literalists and power mongers of the early Roman Church and Empire hijacked the gospel to create a new state religion for the crumbling empire.</p>

<p>The original Christianity was a synthesis of fundamental religious beliefs and various mythos of cultures around the Mediterranean and Middle East. This would include Judaism, and Buddhism (hence abandonment of ego, and use of Old testament allegory), and the cults of Osiris, Dionysus, and Mithras (hence the repeated allusion to trial, death, and salvation). </p>

<p>The Theraputae were the ancient precursor to what we now know developed into the Illuminati. Their objective was to create a mythos or philosophy that could assist in the development of the masses through transformational allegory and symbolism. They were probably a very heavy influence on the Essenes, who recorded many of the gospel texts, and are most notably known for the Dead Sea Scrolls, are very likely one of the ascetic groups that contributed to the development of Christian Mythos.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutae">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutae</a></p>

<p>That said, Crowley had a few screws loose in the end. He deliberately turned himself into a wretch through the indulgence in narcotics. Still, one of the most profound minds of our era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you just come to realize that every aspect of the &quot;new world order&quot; is riddled with paganism, more specifically satanism all the dots begin to connect.  Being a person of faith (Christian) it only makes more sense at how we have been &quot;brainwashed&quot; into living in a world which is for the most part staged.</p>

<p>I try to be respectful of everyone, but I do not like political correctness.  If you happen to not believe in God or have a particular faith; understanding how evil those in power are, admit that maybe it&#39;s part of the conspiracy too?  Now I&#39;m not trying to push a specific view.  Just maybe they actually don&#39;t want you open yourself up to God, to know evil don&#39;t you have to also acknowledge good?  And believe it or not the Bible pretty much spells out exactly what has happened in the last 200 years.</p>

What specifically is the difference between non-LaVeyan satanism and paganism? Also if you could, define what you believe God is (is &quot;he&quot; humanoid? is he sentient? or is he pure light and love? is &quot;he&quot; a &quot;he&quot; at all?).</p>

<p>Second, can you provide some examples of passages in the bible that have prophesied our last 200 years? I ask not because I doubt you or your claim, but because I want to believe the things you say hold some water.</p>

<p>also this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I try to be respectful of everyone, but I do not like political correctness. If you happen to not believe in God or have a particular faith; understanding how evil those in power are, admit that maybe it&#39;s part of the conspiracy too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>confused me quite a bit. Would you mind rephrasing? I hope it&#39;s not too much to ask, as I am honestly quite intrigued by the things you said.</p>

<p>You know, it&#39;s strange. The guy&#39;s username is asking politely to be heard, yet people quickly downvoted him to the bottom of this thread based solely on the fact that he spoke using somewhat outdated terms, terms like God and saying that he&#39;s Christian. I cannot understand it. Where are peoples&#39; open minds? God doesn&#39;t automatically mean sky-fairy old bearded man.</p>

<p>You all need to truly learn how to think around here.</p>

<p>oh and as for the quote you gave me, that&#39;s very interesting. Are you well read in Crowley in general, Masagin? I would love to discuss it with you sometime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your defense DaVincitheReptile.  But I expected I would possibly get negative feedback from just being honest.  Why can we not discuss religion or openly talk about God or Jesus without people labeling them overbearing and crazy?</p>

<p>All I&#39;m looking for is someone who doesn&#39;t have faith (atheist, agnostic, etc) to be open for the possibility the reason you do not have faith could be part of the overall conspiracy.  No one likes to be fooled or taken advantage of, no matter what your religion is.  But if they really understand the complexity and deceit the New World Order has established, faith in God and the teachings of Jesus would obviously be on the top of their list to corrupt.</p>

<p>All I ask is for people to have an open mind, its frustrating to me that all I want is an honest open discussion and because God doesn&#39;t &#39;fit in&#39; with the times I don&#39;t get taken seriously.  The conspiracy is on the level of &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  What you live in your &quot;every day life&quot; is the computer simulation, when you &quot;wake up&quot; you realize how few of you there are that know and can understand the truth &quot;Zion&quot;, and the odds look overwhelming but somehow they seem to never stop fighting.  The ones still asleep don&#39;t even have a choice to stand for themselves, they believe in NOTHING.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t lose heart, man. There are those of us around here that are willing to keep an open mind. I once was an agnostic that somewhat despised organized religion, but a few experiences of mine have changed my perspective. My father teaches the bible as literature at my local high school, and talking with him about a few ideas really opened my mind to the possibilities of what religious ideals/stories are trying to communicate. The blind will be blind whether they&#39;re atheiest or christian. If you enjoy talking about this stuff, you can send me a PM sometime. I promise I won&#39;t ridicule anything you say.</p>

<p>Can you name <em>any</em> time in the last 5,000 years of history when this was <strong>not</strong> directly applicable? I have never heard a &quot;prophecy&quot; that was not vague or specific enough (outside of Titor) to actually have meaning. Try again.</p>

Future historians, especially those who seek the <em>true</em> history of mankind, will seek out the words of those you refer to as &quot;insane&quot;, because the true truth is essential to what we believe everyone should know.

<p>We, the insane, view those (like yourself, I presume) who do <em>not</em> question the authorities and their corrupt lies, as deeply stupid.

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I could upvote you harder.</p>

<p>I remember taking acid for the first time and thinking &quot;wow now I&#39;ve truly gone insane&quot;. Then I had flashbacks of my childhood and its memories, and I&#39;m fairly sure my third eye was forced open. All of a sudden I was meditating in my room, flexing my entire body until I could feel warmth throughout, and I could actually perceive the aura around me. The walls bent as with Neo in the end of the Matrix. I asked myself &quot;Is this the drug?&quot; but soon realized that many of the thought patterns I was having I also had distant memories of, either from childhood, some sort of past life, or possibly pre-birth.  The memories were not entirely cognitive mind you, they were in my gut flesh and bones.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that I could see how all the influences throughout my life so far had played a role in shaping my worldview. All the movies and television I had watched had placed images in my mind of what particular things were that do or do not exist. I was outside the box for the first time since I was placed in the box. Through this logic, I came to the conclusion that the world is not at all as it seems, and there is some sort of large conspiracy shaping worldviews throughout the Earth in order to control thought and therefore actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was at a convention once where Crowley was being discussed. It seemed that everyone, for and against, actually thought Crowley believed in what he was doing literally. I tried to explain that Crowley himself said he was an Atheist.</p>

<p>A very crude oversimplification would be that Crowley&#39;s system of &quot;magick&quot; is an exhaustive collection of physical and mental exercises designed to generate an altered state of consciousness. His pantheon of metaphors is simply that... metaphors. Designed in a very specific way to illicit a specific response.</p>

<p>I was mostly agreeing with Yurphurp about sarcasm in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only had this subreddit frontpaged for a few days but I&#39;m surprised at the lack of context and rationality. I&#39;m really quite surprised anyone takes a fungible conspiracy seriously. ( i.e. <em>all</em> of the bankers... there&#39;s no <em>all</em> of anything to blame)</p>

<p>To get back to Crowley though... first I think his commentary on bankers is probably satire, second you have to take the whole of western society at that time into account to understand the actions or opinions of any one player.</p>

<p>The one good thing to come out of British imperialism at the turn of the century was the processing of all new information from throughout the world by the universities of the British Isles. How this new information, new art, and new perspectives was digested by the western world informed an entire generation of thinkers and artists.</p>

<p>James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Pablo Picasso, Frank Loyd Wright, Alfred Korzybski, Wilhelm Reich, Nikola Tesla, Carl Jung, Aleister Crowley all came up at about the same time and were trying to wrap their heads around all of this new information. They all interacted in various ways and influenced each other. Aleister Crowley&#39;s opinion on bankers was surely not his alone.</p>

<p>The important contributions of Pound and Crowley are their intimate understanding of Asian culture and how it informed their work. Crowley&#39;s system incorporated as much Sufi tradition and Yoga as he traced the modern magical orders back through time to locate their origins.</p>

<p>Ezra Pound&#39;s contributions to the work of Ernest Fenollosa almost singlehandedly redefined the western world&#39;s understanding of the Asian world. If you&#39;ve ever enjoyed a haiku then you owe it mostly to these two men.</p>

<p><em>The Cantos Of Ezra Pound</em> is going to become a great Rosetta Stone by which East and West will begin to better learn about each other. Learning to bring your own consciousness under control and helping to clear the mind of emotional compulsions would be Crowley&#39;s contribution.</p>

<p>Or something like that... </p>
