        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since joining Reddit I&#39;ve become very interested in world affairs and politics, and not the representation of them provided by the mainstream media, but work by the truly intelligent and independent reporters. My first thoughts of conspiracy was, &#39;what a bunch of crazies&#39; but the more you read and cross check some of these things the more it becomes apparent that you guys are the minority of people that are actually aware of whats going on. This morning I sat completely gripped watching John Pilger&#39;s &#39;The War You Don&#39;t See&#39;, and just finished Zeitgeist. I have the Obama Deception ready to watch and as a secondary function of this post could anyone link me some other well produced and informational films in the same vein of thought?</p>

<p>It is all terrifyingly clear that the movie is 100% correct. Everything fits and makes sense, not to mention its backed by solid evidence. I sat there and wondered how the masses could actually let this atrocity of a NWO form, but if the governments been so successful in persuading us to go to war this many times its not a stretch to imagine they can persuade us that a one world government is a good idea. Once those RFID chips are implemented they literally have us by the balls, and even if we realize whats happening theres nothing we can do at that point.</p>

<p>What the fuck? I&#39;m stunned by everything I just watched...What can I do? I posted the movie to Facebook, but in 99-100% of the cases even if people follow the link they&#39;ll be like &#39;Fuck that, too long.&#39; Which just demonstrates the sad state of affairs on a personal level.</p>

<p>I&#39;m scared, /conspiracy.</p>

<p>You being scared and alarmist is only going to hurt your quest for truthiness, when you start going on about this, the wrong way, in a &quot;normal&quot; social setting, people will suddenly act like they saw an alien-ghost-hitler-samurai-abelincoln instead of a concerned scholarly gentleman.</p>

<p>It takes some time, but you must never accept anything as 100% true or 100% bullshit.
After looking at &quot;conspiratorial&quot; things for years, one has to establish their own procedure in regards with processing the information apocalypse, breaking it down, and disseminating it in such a way that helps others to understand the concepts without scaring them away forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That conspiracy science article is very pro-religion. Considering the topic scientifically I wouldn&#39;t come to that conclusion. It says &#39;religion can do a lot of good for some people&#39;. I would say it is the altruistic nature of people that has done any good. What good has come from any religion in itself and its own specific practices?(Honest question) I&#39;m not talking about missionaries that help struggling populations because you don&#39;t have to be religious to do that. 
There are a fuck-load of religions with a lot of similarities. Certain things were picked for controlling certain populations. What I take away from Zeitgeist is that these religions were meant to control and contain thoughts and actions, and hey thats probably been the only way you could control people effectively in history. You definitely can&#39;t depend on logic and reason to keep people civil, at least not yet. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m just reading through the  conspiracy science 9/11 debunk page and it looks like they are just as guilty of drawing conclusions. Here&#39;s one example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>countless witness statements of people who were driving or in the area at the time and clearly saw a plane</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not scientific at all. It relies on witness statements(the <em>worst</em> kind of evidence, it shouldn&#39;t be considered applicable) and it also uses the term &#39;countless&#39; to try and reinforce the authors position. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with conspiracy theories is their greatest strength. Look at what you wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is all terrifyingly clear that the movie is 100% correct. 
Everything fits and makes sense, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the world doesn&#39;t fit and make sense. What scientific concept is 100% correct? When is anything ever 100% correct? It&#39;s nothing but a fantasy to ever imagine that anybody out there knows the full story about anything. Furthermore the topics discussed in Zeitgeist are so complex that any correct analysis cannot possibly yield a completely coherent picture. </p>

<p>But the strength of conspiracy theory, much like religion, is that it takes away the doubt. It tells a compelling story that glosses over any hint of complexity, any nuance that would lead us to want to question more, it answers the questions we couldn&#39;t possibly answer for us. Furthermore belief in it is your ticket into an exclusive club. An exclusive club of true believers among the sheep. And conspiracy theories travel much like religion, by the way, people proselytize their friends and expect that everyone knows and adheres to their beliefs.</p>

<p>The truth about a NWO is scarier than any conspiracy theory could possibly be. There is no NWO because there is no order. Every single country is struggling to come up with a plan to advance their own agendas and weighing the costs as they see it. Everyone is stabbing blindly in the dark, without any knowledge of what the future holds and without any inherent organization. If there ever seems like there is a coherent picture it is because any complex system always produces apparent orders and patterns regardless of how truly chaotic the system is itself. </p>

<p>Nothing Zeitgeist talks about is inarguable or obviously true. My understanding, and most research that has been presented in other comments confirms, Zeitgeist is largely fiction and misrepresented facts. Of course people form groups and groups do big scary things, but there are plenty of groups and they are all fighting each other and all failing at making any order of anything. Even the most authoritarian regimes are fraught with conflict and dissent, and even the largest and most powerful things die. The only complete story in your life is your own and at any given moment advancing that story is more important than worrying about conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A new world order is not bad in itself, the world is constantly changing so &quot;new orders&quot; are happening all the time.  Compared to 50 years ago, the world is a completely new order, thanks to globalization and the internet.  You can&#39;t just start freaking out every time a leader talks about world change and assume they are talking about a secret society hell bent on world domination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can &quot;freak out&quot; (keeping your head about your of course) if you see that it is leading to globalization. Where a perfect and harmonious &quot;one world&quot; would be eutopic and ideal (and something I hope that would be possible, just don&#39;t see how with the current state of things) it is completely implausible. </p>

<p>First, in the minds of the people who are calling for a new world order, they are hoping to be with the Central Banks that are in control of the new &quot;one world&quot;. That is not theory. They call it their new world financial order. Do your research and you can see that throughout history Central Banks have only led to ruin. </p>

<p>Second, America was created to be a nation based on laws, a republic. We are one of the VERY few countries that operate(d) on this system and seeing how vastly different we are now, compared to what the founders created, is truly frightening. To be &quot;one&quot; with nations like China, Russia, Israel, Sudan....nations that have nothing even remotely in common with ours is not something I want to see happen.  If this isn&#39;t something that terrifies you, mabey you should look outside of your typical school history books and look for how having a central bank in control of our country (or the world) can only lead to the defeat of our nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well don&#39;t believe half of it. Consider it a wake up call and that you need to do you&#39;re own research no matter what.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not an alien, UFO or reptilian person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watch Zeitgeist Addendum and there is a list of things to do. They are in short: </p>

<p>1 Expose banking fraud</p>

<p>Join a credit union and pay your credit card balance off in full every month. Do not support crooked banks and their cronies. Who just bought up a bunch of Facebook stock? Yeah Facebook is out too.</p>

<p>You get the gist where the other solutions fall into.</p>

<p>2 Turn off the tv news -  protect the internet.</p>

<p>3 Don&#39;t ever join or let anyone you know join the military.</p>

<p>4 Stop supporting energy companies - get off the grid, investigate self sustainability, smallest car, hybrid, </p>

<p>5 Reject the political system.</p>

<p>6 thezeitgeistmovement.com</p>

<p>7 Revolution of consciousness.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to know. There are only two ways to make money. You work for it or you take if from someone else. The government does not make or produce money. Economy is produced by the people. Politics takes money away from the people.</p>

<p>The famous George Carlin speech that you will see around here states that: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fuckin’ years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Go out and buy a kitchen table or use someone elses that feels the same way you do about Zeitgeist and invite others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Looking at whats happening in Mexico I can&#39;t help but hypothesis its the next Iraq, though on a smaller scale. If the combat mission is ending in Iraq the government will no doubt want to fuel the war machine, it&#39;d be ridiculously easy to convince the American public that the cartel threat needs military intervention. It&#39;s painfully obvious that marijuana needs to be legalized, its almost impossible to argue against the fact with any form of rational defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear you woke up. There are a lot of righteous assholes here on reddit that think they have everything figured out, but don&#39;t let that get to you. Note that most of them will call everything you watch or read stupid or &quot;horribly researched&quot; and then offer nothing as a source of their own. I agree that much of <em>Zeitgeist</em> is right on target, not so sure about 100%, but it&#39;s very good. Several of Alex Jones&#39;s latest films are quite good, like <em>Obama Deception</em>, <em>Fall of the Republic</em>, and <em>Endgame</em>. There are many good mainstream intellectuals I&#39;d recommend too, like Richard Dawkins, Noam Chomsky, Christopher Hitchens, Howard Zinn, and Carl Sagan. You can learn a lot from these people, but remember that nobody is perfect. My favorite book is <em>Understanding Power</em> by Noam Chomsky. He does a great job at pointing out hypocrisy, but I personally think he is a left-wing gatekeeper.  </p>

Look at their website and count how many almost hyper religious zealot statements there are, look how hard they make it for anyone not indoctrinated to their way of thinking to post anything on the site, and finally consider the total progress of the Venus Project (0%. only theory, nothing in practice). The only logical conclusion I can ever draw is that this couple that runs the Venus project has created a borderline cult without the religion part to suck up money for themselves. You would be better off contacting your local socialist political party and asking about things like scientific socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movement is trying to create a system where resources are centrally managed, something that is extremely hard to do and has never been done remotely well. Saving the seas or endangered species is irrelevant at this point, and even if a good system were in place it wouldn&#39;t stop people from deciding whether or not to let species die off or pollute certain amounts. If you want an ounce of respect for your cause, put in the effort to build a working system somewhere. Sure it will probably fail horribly for a while, but eventually all of the systems and compromises to reality will produce a better system. I mean the Amish have built up a nice society without technology at all, why not do something similar?</p>

<p>The 911 guys, the assassination of Kennedy etc are conspiracy theories because the truth in unknown and to some extent, unknowable.   </p>

<p>They are not the same.</p>

<p>Remember, that in life odd things happen, people lie and some have something to sell. Don&#39;t get carried away.   The elites that run the world are not some unified secret power.  They are competing with each other too.  Yes, occasionally they club together to support changes that are in all of their interests, but that does not mean they are all lizard people sworn to destroy humans.  They&#39;re a happy to destroy each other if the price is right.  </p>

<p>Having said all  that, keep one thing in mind : governments all over the world, were created to protect the rich and powerful from the likes of you  and I -  and there are no limits to what that will do in performing that duty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put Option deals on airline stock that made hundreds of million$ were traced to Mossad HQ in Tel Aviv Israel.</p>

<p>Could be Jews who knew the attacks were going to happen, sat up late in Melbourne and Sydney Australia on the evening of September 11, to watch the show which began in those cities sometime around 00:02 AEST Sept 12.</p>

<p>Maybe it was common knowledge in some schools, picture teenage entrepreneurs sitting up late stuffing their guts with pizza, watching their investments mature, did a spike occur in late night food orders in Australia prior to the attacks on the evening of 911, if it did, were those extra orders delivered to the homes of Jews?? </p>

<p>More specifically that of Frank Lowy of Australian Soccer and Westfield fame, he was mixed up with Larry Silverstein re the proposed redevelopment of the WTC site .. It follows that if Silverstein knew so did he. </p>

<p>They can cry tears of blood, but 911 and the subsequent wars are by Jews, for Jews, and enable a Jew agenda, read the Talmud it endorses genocide against non Jews, the Jews wantonly blew up the Twin Towers, then blamed innocent people in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p><strong>Lowy and S&#39;stein were killers in the ethnic cleansing ops that were carried out in occupied Palestine since 1948.</strong></p>

<p>Oh the blessed irony ..let me see now, the parameter for execution in a capital terrorism case is guilt pure and simple.</p>

<p>All investors, that means everywhere food orders went so will investigation, thence prosecution and execution attend those same party places, whence all will be reassembled tried and put to death.</p>

<p>It might resemble the massacres of Palestinians even as the Jews are guilty while they were innocent, like the ppl in the towers the Jews deserted.</p>

<p>While NYPD helicopters ruled the skies and refused to rescue those who made it on to the roofs, and those that were trapped behind locked fire doors.</p>

<p>Imagine the gasping and heat, then picture a gas chamber at the same New York location gassin&#39; Jews!!!!</p>

<p>I highly recommend checking out Mike Ruppert&#39;s talk on 9/11, which can be found on YouTube for free. Easily the best debunking of the 9/11 myth out there , and does so without even discussing controlled demo or any &quot;theories&quot;. Jus&#39; facts. Ruppert&#39;s book is also fantastic. I also suggest reading both of Col. L. Fletcher Prouty&#39;s books (<em>The Secret Team</em>, and <em>JFK</em>) Both are great tools in helping to understand how compartmentalization works and how the CIA is nothing close to what it portrays itself to be. </p>

<p>I have devised a simple test whence the Jews who side with me, and demand the following matter which goes to the very heart of Jewish culture and history, gets promptly and thoroughly investigated to the end that the guilty are hanged, will not be hated at all who will indeed have my respect.</p>

<p>Katherine Schweitzer was a Hungarian Jew the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust, last seen alive in Sydney Australia 22 December 2006, </p>

<p>She went public in the nineties on the television show Australian 60 Minutes, saying the Jew who arrested her and her family in 1944 had taken up residence on the same street in Sydney.</p>

<p>On 30 November 2006 I put her account of her arrest and internment in Auschwitz onto the net, December 28 2006, her body was found in a wheelie bin inside her high security apartment .. Fritz-Harry Cremer could be Mossad and might have talked his way into her apartment and murdered her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Self styled Moslems who refuse to &quot;hurl truth&quot; in relation to the 911 attacks, are in a similar scornful predicament.. </p>

<p><strong>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</strong></p>

<p>We did not create the heaven and the Earth and what is between them for sport.</p>

<p>Had We wished to make a diversion, We would have made it from before Ourselves: by no means would We do (it).</p>

<p>Nay! We cast the truth against the falsehood, so that it breaks its head, and it vanishes; and woe to you for what you describe.</p>

<p><strong>The Koran: Chapter 21 The Prophets, verses 16 17 &amp; 18</strong></p>

<p>So where the hell do these wankers who claim to be Moslems hurl truth, the 911 attacks that became the impetus for illegal and unjust war against Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, were an inside job carried out by Zionist Jews.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.min.us/idAMdo.jpg">http://i.min.us/idAMdo.jpg</a></p>

<p>The great heroes of black America the Martin Luther Luther Kings were in a snipers nest in Dallas Texas 22 November 1963, they had been guests in Mrs Kennedy’s home weeks before they murdered her husband before her eyes.</p>

<p>The Koran describe those same false Moslems who refuse to hurl truth, who yet find the time for “vain discourse,” as “below the level of the beasts of the field” which is how I treat them!</p>
