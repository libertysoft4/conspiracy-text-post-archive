    <div class="md"><p>Podcasts of every show are available <a href="http://podcast.gcnlive.com/podcast/alex/pcast.php">here</a> free, immediately at the end of each hour of broadcast. I play them in my VLC player, using control-right-arrow (one minute jump) to jump through the commercials. Also, I playback the shows at 2X speed. Alex&#39;s diction is so good that he&#39;s very clear at 2X speed, and it&#39;s actually easier to focus at the higher speed (like in speed reading). I can get through a three hour show in less than an hour.</p>

<p>I appreciate that Alex (and some others like <a href="http://podcast.gcnlive.com/podcast/world_crisis/pcast.php">Webster Tarpley</a> and <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/podcast.php">Mike Rivero</a>) make their shows available this way, saving my valuable time.

    <div class="md"><p>The ads are skippable &amp; have to be there for time in syndication (local stations place their own ads over his). It&#39;s a cottage shop that has to hawk its products - I used to work at a small political news shop and dealt with doing the same kind of sales. I read the SOTT piece against AJ, there is some merit but the problem is really more about pigeonholing and skipping over the details, rather than COINTELPRO misdirection. If maybe you got a problem with the array of news, head somewhere else. It&#39;s a growing field now...</p>

<p>On the other hand I think it would be better for him to disclose all financial interests as some have alleged he owns a piece of some other sites, or perhaps get kickbacks. That would only really make it more solid. Another factor is how much $$ he makes per copy of video sold produced by these independent producers. On the other hand they would sell more copies marketing to the infowars audience, but they may buy expensive ads on the frontpage. This is how you keep your head above water in publishing, especially publishing that ticks some powerful people off.</p>

<p>I did a call in after the Pittsburgh G20, part1
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE0_ag7CuOk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE0_ag7CuOk</a>
it was pretty funny, he was amped up and a bit all over the place. The tricky thing going in was how he&#39;s kind of said that blackbloc anarchists are all provocateurs or whatever, but he walked that back before I could even address it.</p>

<p>Overall while we should of course be skeptical and cross examine all claims etc., but having worked a bit in publishing I think puts this in perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people like TexMex waste to much time on people like Alex Jones when they should be focusing on the people who are taking this country to the ground.</p>

<p>When people are interested in the Truth Movement and come to find information, they find stuff like what TexMex posts.</p>

<p>Attacking other people inside the truth movement, makes us look like a bunch of fools. Like HongPong said..it is always good to be skeptical and cross examine..but if you have no understanding of how a business works then you have no place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha you obviously have a lot of time to waste.</p>

<p>Think about this. Alex Jones owns his own company. Freedom Speech Networks (I believe). He has to, rent out the studio, pay for all software, radio broadcast equipment (if you have ever even been into a SMALL radio broadcast show your talking an easy $25,000+. Your talking about movie productions, OH this is his job, so he has to eat AND FEED HIS FAMILY. He has employees, with salary&#39;s, and benefits. </p>

<p>he encourages his fans to download, to distribute. His show is completely free to access. Prison planet is hardly a dent in your wallet if you want to go that far...</p>

<p>I hardly doubt that he is making a HUGE profit off what he does. </p>

<p>Do you work in the broadcast industry?</p>

<p>1) Torchy&#39;s Tacos on South 1st. He was eating a Taco and drinking Diet Dr. Pepper.
2) Alamo Drafthouse on South Lamar. He and his wife arrived in a CL65 AMG. That&#39;s a $200K car.
3) CVS in South Austin. He was on line to pick up a prescription from the EVIL DRUG COMPANIES!</p>

<p>I noticed that all the sponsors on his website are comapnies whose products cannot be bought off the shelf of a local store. Almost everything seems to be from some obscure mail order company whose only store front is a PO Box. my guess is that Jones is a majority owner in most of those stores.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an AMG for sure. I&#39;m a hardcore car guy and know my German vehicles :P</p>

<p>The guy is wealthy. About that, there is no doubt. </p>

<p>Just think about him trying to do anything else. He has a few credit hours from Austin Community College. For the last ten (more?) years he&#39;s been doing his own conspiracy radio show. Can imagine him trying to get a real job? It&#39;d be impossible. At this point, whether he really believes what he says or not, he&#39;s committed to trudging on - because he has to. </p>

<p>I think 90% of what he says is total bullshit, and another 9% is a complete misunderstanding of things that require a nuanced understanding (economics, for example). The 1% he gets right is obvious to anybody who follows markets: investment banks meet to discuss derivatives prices? Well no-fucking-shit Sherlock!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am against the big drug companies as well. However I do suffer from severe constant Sinus Infections. I do have to get antibiotics for that otherwise my head would explode. Those do help. Could you tell us what drug he was picking up? If not that claim holds no water.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care what kind of car he drives, these days that means absolutley nothing. My uncle is unemployed, and owned a $150 Dollar BMW and was in massive debt. Also, you could possibly lease that type of vehicle for almost what I pay each month on my car that I &quot;own&quot; which is about $400+. You can lease a $100,000 BMW for about $550 a month depending on your credit. Do you know if he owned that car straight out? What type of deal he got on that car? Does he own, or lease? Did he rent that car?</p>

<p>Eating a taco and drinking a Diet Dr. Pepper..this matters because?</p>

<p>I think you guys are forgetting that Alex Jones is a journalist. He was a journalist before he had his own show and wrote articles the whole 9 yards. He found the truth, and dedicated his journalism and broadcast experience to spreading information in that specific genre. He is no one special and doesn&#39;t claim to be. He doesn&#39;t claim to be broke. However, I have not yet met a &quot;Businessman&quot; who creates a product and says..download it..distribute it and don&#39;t give me anything for it. </p>

<p>Is it a crime that this dude makes money off of products and a radio show that he OWNS and creates? That is the real question here. </p>

<p>I listen to his show often, not FOR Alex Jones (except I do enjoy his ranging rants when he is upset) but because I find that the information is talks about is valuable and I enjoy the way he presents it. He isn&#39;t the norm of the talk radio genre. He shows emotion, gives his opinion and gives you what he has. He even tells you to look that shit up if you don&#39;t buy what he is saying. The first time I heard him, I thought he was a crackjob. I sat down for one entire show and looked up everything he spoke about and I found everything. Not one thing didn&#39;t come up or wasn&#39;t true in the way he explained it.</p>

<p>The man has millions of listeners who listen to him on a daily basis and receive truck loads of great information that will benefit us in the long run. Are you against that?</p>

<p>I noticed that all the sponsors on his website are comapnies whose products cannot be bought off the shelf of a local store. Almost everything seems to be from some obscure mail order company whose only store front is a PO Box. my guess is that Jones is a majority owner in most of those stores.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am against the big drug companies as well. However I do suffer from severe constant Sinus Infections. I do have to get antibiotics for that otherwise my head would explode. Those do help. Could you tell us what drug he was picking up? If not that claim holds no water.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care what kind of car he drives, these days that means absolutley nothing. My uncle is unemployed, and owned a $150 Dollar BMW and was in massive debt. Also, you could possibly lease that type of vehicle for almost what I pay each month on my car that I &quot;own&quot; which is about $400+. You can lease a $100,000 BMW for about $550 a month depending on your credit. Do you know if he owned that car straight out? What type of deal he got on that car? Does he own, or lease? Did he rent that car?</p>

<p>Eating a taco and drinking a Diet Dr. Pepper..this matters because?</p>

<p>I think you guys are forgetting that Alex Jones is a journalist. He was a journalist before he had his own show and wrote articles the whole 9 yards. He found the truth, and dedicated his journalism and broadcast experience to spreading information in that specific genre. He is no one special and doesn&#39;t claim to be. He doesn&#39;t claim to be broke. However, I have not yet met a &quot;Businessman&quot; who creates a product and says..download it..distribute it and don&#39;t give me anything for it. </p>

<p>Is it a crime that this dude makes money off of products and a radio show that he OWNS and creates? That is the real question here. </p>

<p>I listen to his show often, not FOR Alex Jones (except I do enjoy his ranging rants when he is upset) but because I find that the information is talks about is valuable and I enjoy the way he presents it. He isn&#39;t the norm of the talk radio genre. He shows emotion, gives his opinion and gives you what he has. He even tells you to look that shit up if you don&#39;t buy what he is saying. The first time I heard him, I thought he was a crackjob. I sat down for one entire show and looked up everything he spoke about and I found everything. Not one thing didn&#39;t come up or wasn&#39;t true in the way he explained it.</p>

<p>The man has millions of listeners who listen to him on a daily basis and receive truck loads of great information that will benefit us in the long run. Are you against that?</p>
