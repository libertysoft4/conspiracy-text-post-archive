You&#39;d be surprised how much good music is out there once you start paying attention.  You just got to learn the code for some of it.  Knowledge from experience sounds a lot different than knowledge from books, but it&#39;ll still teach you something.  Have you ever actually listened to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNcloTmvTeA">2pac</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GygEAcFFMVs">Biggie</a>?  </p>

<p>Your not going to like everything, but you&#39;ll miss so much sticking to one style.  Just use your brain and don&#39;t get hustled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really liked that song until the part about &quot;George Bush the grandson of Aleister Crowley&quot; as if that somehow suggests something about Bush&#39;s alignment or something? Crowley was a real smart guy... It just makes me feel like whoever wrote the lyrics (I assume the guy rapping that part) has fallen for the general media portraying Crowley as a &#39;black wizard&#39; or some such. In other words, the writers claim to be outside the cave but are still themselves only watching shadows on a wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re going to have to give an accurate definition of what &quot;the Beast of Revelations&quot; is if you want me to better understand why it&#39;s a bad thing to be associated with Crowley, and I mean an archaic one, not a modernized version of what the beast is (red devil with horns that burns you in hell for eternity).</p>

<p>The language of all parts of The Holy Bible is simply too archaic to be interpreted using modern terms. &quot;Satan&quot; is a term that simply means &#39;adversary&#39; which resonates with the eastern philosophical idea of the yin and the yang. They are necessary for each other&#39;s existences. Why is it that Crowley cannot just be one who goes against socially accepted norms in general and also delves into taboo ideals and therefore labels himself using the outdated language that is also used in the Bible? Consider the recent past and you see how the definition and images conjured when &quot;the beast&quot; is mentioned differs highly from those images prior to the advent of (recent) technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s whatever he meant it to be. Combined with &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; and connections between Crowley&#39;s &quot;work&quot; and the Church of Satan, we can at least deduce what his works inspired. I&#39;m an atheist, so this is not a hatred of the man fueled by religious beliefs. This is looking at a trees fruits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it&#39;s whatever he meant it to be. That doesn&#39;t mean that your mind will necessarily interpret it and derive the same intention from it. Why is it that atheists can never think about the stories in the bible in an allegorical or metaphorical sense? Why is it that you have to fight those religious nuts that believe in its [<em>The Holy Bible&#39;s</em>] every literal word? Why can&#39;t you just ignore the ones who are obviously moronic and come to conclusions about what the author&#39;s true intentions in writing the story were?</p>

<p>Things are not always as they appear. I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but my earlier analogy to Plato&#39;s Cave was not only spot on for the rap group&#39;s lyrics, but also for the mindset of most of western humanity. Your responses only validate this claim in my mind even more.</p>

<p>EDIT: Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Bible">Anton LaVey&#39;s <em>The Satanic Bible</em></a>. It is philosophy, not a cult-worship of a red goat with horns surrounded by fire wielding a pitchfork. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware it&#39;s a philosophy and I&#39;m aware, at least publicly, there is no goat-horned red-man worship. What I am saying, is that the philosophy of &quot;Do what thou wilt, that shall be the whole of the law&quot; leaves room to comfortably interpret a lot of disgusting acts and behaviour. Why should I ignore people who have, in my opinion, an immoral code of ethics? Please explain how this &quot;commandment&quot; is benign. I do think of the Bible as metaphors and allegories and I don&#39;t fight with religious people. At least they claim to have limits on their behaviour.</p>

<p>RESULTS: Symptom complaints increased significantly following the aerial spraying, in particular: sleep problems, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, irritated throat, itchy nose, diarrhoea, stomach discomfort, and gas discomfort. Analyses showed a significant increase in symptoms in those participants with a previous history of hay fever. While overall self-ratings of health decreased following the spraying, <strong>most residents saw their health as unaffected by the spray programme, and there was no significant increase in visits to general practitioners or alternative healthcare providers.</strong></p>

<p>My name is Mick West, I’m a private pilot (in training, I have a solo certification, and have flown a 150 mile solo flight).  I’ve been training out of Santa Monica airport, so I know the airspace round here. I like writing, and figuring things out. See something odd in the sky? Let me know.</p>

<p>I’m not a scientist, or a meteorologist, but I like to think that what I post is comprised of independently verifiable facts.  You can check the facts yourself.  If you find ANY error on this site, then let me know and I will issue a correction immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the subredit is only for true believers and those that follow the gospel of Jones?</p>

<p>i wasnt aware this was a religious subreddit, maybe i should go. its disruptive to have to defend your claims. it should just be a circle jerk of other believers, that way you dont have to explain anything, just claim anything you want and you will be believed. </p>

<p>and yes i disregard the &quot;truth&quot; movement because within the movement itself there are various conflicting versions of the &quot;truth&quot; and that&#39;s not what &quot;truth&quot; means. there is only 1 version of the truth and they cant all be &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p>for example, you probably noticed my comment about the &quot;evil death ray&quot; that shot the pentagon instead of a plane. there&#39;s also the claim that it was a missile. </p>

<p>how can the &quot;truth&quot; movement be taken seriously as a serious claim to &quot;Truth&quot; when it doesnt agree with itself, it tells anyone that disagrees and asks for credible sources to go away and sticks their fingers in their ears while saying &quot;LALALALAICANTHEARYOU&quot; like you just did?</p>

<p>i&#39;m obviously interested in what happened on 911 and dont particularly buy all of the official story, but so far what i&#39;ve seen in the &quot;truther&quot; counter claims is even less believable and easily debunked.</p>

<p>but this is about chemtrails, another easily debunked (by a pilot. so easy even a pilot can do it ;) nonexistent conspiracy. i&#39;m sorry you&#39;re too close minded to soil your eyes on such a website that is obviously so useless that it&#39;s not worth your time. after all the subject is airplanes and weather, what would a pilot know about that, its not like he gives actual sources or links to the info, which is more than about 99.9% of the truther sites (links to other truther sites doesnt count as a source)</p>

<p>but believe what you want, fear the evil skysnakes, they&#39;re going to control your mind with them. dont let them take your picture either, they may steal your soul too!</p>

<p>also, my questions about what you believe werent forgotten by your attempt at deflection, but it&#39;s pretty obvious from your reaction. Zealotry is never good for any cause.</p>

<p>be a skeptic, but dont stop being a skeptic when someone says something you want to believe

    <div class="md"><p>Theories about the planes and the pentagon aside, collapse analysis of the 3 WTC buildings paints it clearly that they were taken down in explosives. This is the single unifying truth among the movement. If you&#39;re going to split hairs over other parts of the theory then the facts must have gone over your head.</p>

<p>Contrails are like theories that alien UFO&#39;s visit us. No one can disprove it. You can try to disprove each individual accounts, but you cannot disprove the entire theory as a whole no matter what kind of evidence you have.</p>

<p>Does the government do testing on unwitting citizens?</p>

<p>As a 911 truther I am very open to the idea that the government might be spraying harmful chemicals on us. Tell me, what would a REAL chemtrail  look like. How would it look different from the photos you dismiss as contrails. If you can&#39;t answer that then kindly fuck off.</p>
