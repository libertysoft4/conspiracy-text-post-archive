    <div class="md"><p>Did you know that the patriot act is a word for word copy of a bad original, a law precipitated from the Reichstag flase flag event ? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Given their built-in weakness and their willingness to swallow the most outrageous Big Lies emanating from the propaganda ministry and the media, most Germans were fruit waiting to be plucked by the Nazi harvesters. ‘They still fall for anything. After all that, I do not see that one can blame the majority of Germans who, in 1933, believed that the Reichstag fire was the work of the Communists. [The Parliament burned down and a convenient Communist arsonist was fingered, which the Nazis used as the excuse to unleash police-state tactics against all opponents.] What one can blame them for, and what shows their terrible collective weakness of character clearly for the first time during the Nazi period, is that this settled the matter. With sheepish submissiveness the German people accepted that, as a result of the fire, each one of them lost what little personal freedom and dignity was guaranteed by the constitution; as though it followed as a necessary consequence.’&quot;</p>

<p>Lots of people said that this would be the way things would be, and people laughed at them.</p>

<p>Now a few years later people have forgotten what life used to be like, and its only going to get worse from here on.</p>

<p>You think the way the TSA acts now is scary? This is just the setup for whats coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A major theory brewing now is that these machines are to be used to prevent people from leaving the country with their wealth in precious metals. Nations are now refusing to buy US treasuries. Instead of defaulting on the debt the fed is going to hyperinfnate the currency. This will make the great depression look like a walk in the park.</p>

<p>During the last great depression FDR simply confiscated people&#39;s gold outright. Now that more people are informed and would rebel against such a confiscation the government is just going to try to force the people to leave any remaining wealth on the homeland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the government is setting things in place for the beginning stages of outright revolt in the next 2-5 years. </p>

<p>You can see this with the Food Safety act, which would prevent people from growing their own food, and with these TSA scanners as well. I expect even more legislation to pass in the next year that looks benign (we just want to keep people safe) but is really meant to give them further control of our lives. </p>

That&#39;s how they continue to get legislation like this passed.  Since everything to do with &quot;national security&quot; is a secret and only certain congress-critters and others can &quot;know&quot;, the sociopathes at FBI et al can make up whatever story they like and these idiots believe it because it is a secret so they don&#39;t have to show anybody the proof that, for instance, the FBI intended the &quot;shoe bomber&quot; to get far enough so they could lie and claim there was actually some danger.  They made up the danger themselves.  That&#39;s the problem with a military industrial complex.  When we give lots of extra money to the spooks and they tell us they can&#39;t tell us why because &quot;it&#39;s a big secret&quot;, they almost all start behaving like 5 year old bullies because we let them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In &quot;And Not a Shot Is Fired&quot; Jan Kozak explains &quot;pressure from above and pressure from below&quot; tactic.</p>

<p>How to become a dictator</p>

<p>The creation of &quot;emergencies&quot; is a part of the totalitarian agenda. The creation of &quot;emergencies&quot; gives the gove...rnment an excuse to &quot;crack down&quot;. Then the creation of tyranny becomes justifiable and inevitable.</p>

<p>When &quot;emergencies&quot; erupt the population accepts totalitarian measures as &quot;the</p>

<p>only alternative to the chaos&quot;. The action is in the REACTION.</p>

<p>This tactic is called &quot;pressure from above and pressure from below&quot;.</p>

<p>The Communist book, called &quot;And Not a Shot is Fired&quot; by Jan Kozak , explains this entire strategy. Jan Kozak, who was then a member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, explains how a free government was actually transformed into a totalitarian dictatorship - legally. &quot;And Not a Shot Is Fired&quot; originated as an internal Czechoslovak Communist Party strategy paper.</p>

<p>&quot;And Not a Shot is Fired&quot; is a &quot;&#39;how-to&#39; manual for takeover of a free and elected system of government, through legal means. Kozak&#39;s discussion is not theory about what &quot;might&quot; be possible to accomplish the seizure of power. It is a history of a technique that was actually proven, by its implementation.</p>

<p>And Not a Shot Is Fired by Kozak -</p>

<p>Jan Kozak explains</p>

<p>Pressure from above
is what Jan Kozak called &quot;revolutionary parliamentarianism&quot;. &quot;Revolutionary parliamentarianism&quot; means working INSIDE of the system to change laws in such a way as to increase the power of government.</p>

<p>Pressure from below
consists of the creation of the &quot;emergencies&quot;; which are then used as the excuses to increase the power of government. Karl Marx referred to pressure from below as &quot;the proletarian struggle&quot;. Pressure from below might involve violence, or it might simply be the creation of the appearance of popular support for the increase in the power of government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is precedent for the situation the States are currently in. The last time it was this bad they were referred to as colonies. And for the record, this had nothing to do with tea tax, it had to do with the Bank of England and King George preventing the colonies from using their own monies that were not controlled by the BofE thus allowing them to become too successful by not being forced to pay back interest on a debt that was made up (money printed from nothing) to begin with (National Debt).</p>

Maybe Americans are the proverbial frog in the pot of water gradually heating up so they don&#39;t realize the absurdity and danger of what&#39;s happening, but from overseas, all this TSA shit just looks wacky and bizzarre. It honestly feels like watching some weird sci-fi movie, where the US is basically standing on the doorstep of fascism, waiting for the boss to open the door and usher everybody in.  &quot;PAPERS PLEASE&quot; is something you&#39;re used to hearing in a WW2 movie about Nazis, or stories about the Apartheid years in South Africa.

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta admit, I can&#39;t understand the hysterical naysayers and downvoters in this thread. Maybe Americans are the proverbial frog in the pot of water gradually heating up so they don&#39;t realize the absurdity and danger of what&#39;s happening, but from overseas, all this TSA shit just looks wacky and bizzarre. It honestly feels like watching some weird sci-fi movie, where the US is basically standing on the doorstep of fascism, waiting for the boss to open the door and usher everybody in.  &quot;PAPERS PLEASE&quot; is something you&#39;re used to hearing in a WW2 movie about Nazis, or stories about the Apartheid years in South Africa. Not the USA in 2010 - it seems like we&#39;re in a parallel universe we weren&#39;t meant to be in. </p>
