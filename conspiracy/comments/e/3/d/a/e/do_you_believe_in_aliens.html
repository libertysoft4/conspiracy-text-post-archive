    <div class="md"><p>I think it is foolish to believe there is no life outside of ours on Earth.  We have not completely cataloged life on our own planet, who in their right mind can say for certain what does or does not live outside our blue sphere (or amongst us).</p>

<p>We once believed the Sun revolved around the Earth.  We once believed the Earth was flat.  We think the universe is 13 billion years old, and our planet is 4.5 billion years old.  There is much room for other species to evolve to the point we have, and they don&#39;t have to be on an Earth like planet to live IMHO.</p>

<p>I for one don&#39;t believe we are so advanced that we can say with 100% certainty that we are the only &#39;intelligent&#39; beings in the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree, but military testimony is <em>very</em> different. Typically, those military personnel who are disclosing their witness accounts, have been debriefed on their sightings and are told that it either &quot;didn&#39;t happen&quot; or is top secret. When they come forward and tell their story, they&#39;re violating all sorts of security protocols and subject themselves not only to prosecution, but ridicule as well. IMO, it takes <em>a lot</em> for an ex-military person to come forward and tell their story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember all those high ranking military dudes who came forward regarding the nuke shutdowns? Remember? </p>

<p>Well, 3 of them are releasing books. Here in the Australian military, if you violate those security protocols, you are disciplined. The thing is, these guys didn&#39;t violate anything, they weren&#39;t reprimanded because they exaggerated real, unclassified events, then released books. Which many of you will buy.</p>

<p>Also my friend is a retired TWA/AA pilot, and he said there is basically not a pilot alive that has not had multiple encounters with UFOs and they all believe in them.  They don&#39;t eveb report UFOs to air traffic control unless it is a navigational hazard.</p>

<p>So all pilots regularly see UFOs but not a single one ever thought it might be an idea to take a decent video or photo of one?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are tons of great photos out there but most of them are not on the internet</p>

<p>So where are they then?</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying theres potentially tons of evidence and people just can&#39;t be bothered uploading it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for the alien encounters I&#39;ve had - forget it, I&#39;m not going there. If you wan&#39;t to know why, look no further then your original reply to me, which insinuates I must have a mental illness if I&#39;ve seen an alien. However I will relate My sighting of a UFO.</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s a skeptic until they have seen one with their own eyes, and I&#39;m sure some are hoaxes or mistaken celestial/man made objects.</p>

<p>There are a multitude of pilots, air traffic controllers and police officers who have filed reports, but that barely scratches the surface of sightings that go unreported. I know quite a few people who have seen objects in the sky that cannot be explained - this is far more common amongst the people i know in rural areas.</p>

<p>Here is my own ufo experience:
about 4 years ago, while a friend and I were star gazing with my telescope at 3AM.</p>

<p>The object appeared from the SSE, traveled directly over us in an arc, and headed off in a NNE direction. (Heh, it was shaped pretty much like a <a href="http://www.obh.snafu.de/%7Emadley/starwars/dataimg/imperial_star_destroyer.gif">Imperial Star Destorer</a> from underneath), extremely massive, completely quiet and appeared to be at a very high altitude. There were lights underneath and some were flashing. Unfortunately, due surrounding trees and and a nearby cliff, the object - which to us seemed to be moving super fast - was only visible for a short time.</p>

<p>Pretty sure they saw a similar object in phoenix, referred to as the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5545276251937701731#">phoenix lights.</a> ( part about pheonix lights starts at 06:40).</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know where it was from or who made it, but i&#39;ll tell you what it wasn&#39;t, it wasn&#39;t a fucking weather balloon, a normal plane, and it wasn&#39;t Jupiter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said until it happens to you, everyones a sceptic. </p>

<p>And about the alien encounter<strong>s</strong>.... Your response is understandable and predictable. I recieved the same reaction when I first mentioned it 20 years ago as a teenager - haven&#39;t mentioned it since to anyone in real life, and this is actually this first time I&#39;ve mentioned it on the net - and i might add the last, no sane person appreciates being called delusional.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a normal functioning member of society, running my own successful business, particpating in local sports and community events. What the fuck do i gain for me or anyone else by sharing my experiences? ridicule and scorn, no thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it so difficult for people to believe in the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial beings? In the vastness and shear unimaginable size of the universe, why is it unfathomable to consider human-like life to exist elsewhere? Furthermore, why would anyone even consider it unlikely for a civilization to be thousands or even millions of years ahead of us in technology and understand how to manipulate the fabric of space? After all, these are concepts us monkeys are already theorizing about. I doubt they travel eons in speeds equal to or lesser than light just to come here. However, I would believe that if you could warp space and/or time you could easily move about the entirety of the universe. There might even be a way to detect life like ours from light years away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to believe these things. If you told people 100 years ago that we would all have small devices in our pockets(cell phones) that could contact anyone on Earth at any time they might call bullshit on you, but here we are. All of our thoughts are derived from existing elements and the infinite possible interactions of such. For example, no one can picture a color that their mind hasn&#39;t seen or that doesn&#39;t exist. In this regard, is it not fair to say that if someone CAN imagine something that it must exist is some fashion?</p>

<p>The odds of no aliens, no human civilizations from ancient times who splintered off, are impossible.  Who the fuck built the pyramids and FACES on Mars? If we got to Mars that long ago, how could we have not gone farther? </p>

<p>And who is to say WE are not aliens, brought here, or perhaps, the more evolved primates indigenous to earth were infused with alien genetics time and time again leaving us with the diverse group of humans we have now?  What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you ask, I think you&#39;re an idiot who hasn&#39;t bothered to read about several effective methods by which the pyramids were probably built (not to mention the methods for feeding and housing the large groups of people who did the work), or the close-up photographs of rocks that don&#39;t look anything like faces except at the sort of distances which make faces show up in clouds, craggy rock walls, or even tortillas (due to our hardwired ability to see faces in nearly anything). </p>

<p>I would say it is unlikely that we are the only intelligent life in this galaxy, let alone the universe, but answers like yours make the question of whether intelligent life has evolved on Earth debatable.</p>

<p>Are we still using this term, really? I mean come on. Aliens is a term that typically designates little grey men who, if real, are as much artificial as alive. Alien is a loaded term with alot of fear, rumors, and lies surrounding it.</p>

<p>Extraterrestrials are people just like us. Just because they were born on a different planet doesn&#39;t make them scary or evil or something to be feared. If anything it&#39;s our insane military-industrial complex that is to be feared. We are the ones trying to shoot them out of the sky, not the other way around. Let&#39;s keep it classy and refer to them as extraterrestrials or simply the Greater Family of Man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Microbial life outside of the Earth is possible although only indirect at best evidence has been found primarily on Mars. That said, their spreading across multiple planets is suspect because the main means would be to hitch a ride on ejecta from a planetary impact.

<p>Even if they beat the evolutionary odds, they may or may not be near our technological levels (since they could have their own knowledge and culture productions). Thus, they very easily could be just as stuck on their rock as we currently are. Or destroyed by a quasar.
