The F-35 is said to be the culmination of American military weapons knowledge.  It was designed with the specific intent to be launched at the end of 2010, and be guaranteed to maintain air superiority (i.e. it&#39;s so f*ing advanced that no other country would be able to make a better plane) until 2040.</p>

<p>What kind of planes does the Israeli air force fly currently?   F-15s, F-16s, F-4s.</p>

<p>Where did they get them?  Straight from the US.  What did they pay for them?  Nothing.</p>

<p>I am not saying they didn&#39;t steal the docs, I am saying they had absolutely no motive whatsoever to steal them.  They know the States will just give them planes once they have rolled off the production line in quantity.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of their pilots have already flown them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is plenty motive.</p>

<p>Whenever the United States provides weapons systems to NATO allies, they only offer less sophisticated variants of those weapons.  i.e. we never give them our top of the line electronic counter measures on their fighter planes because we always reserved the best of the best for our forces.  Israel probably would have gotten those technologies at least a decade later. I guess they couldn&#39;t wait for Hannukah.</p>

<p>A 10 year minimum advance on your air force technology is plenty of motive.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy it.  It doesn&#39;t make sense unless they think the US is going to attack them otherwise they have very little use for those systems when they are primarily fighting against 70-80&#39;s era Soviet planes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, seeing as government officials themselves stated that they new for a fact that it was Israeli spy&#39;s who stole the documents, either there is a conspiracy that Israel is planning something against us, or that the government wants us to think that Israel is planning something against us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>uh, don&#39;t agree. Many Jews are anti-Zionist, anti-Zionist not equal to anti-semitic.  Israel has some extremely horrid policies (i.e. war crimes in a lot of cases) and since they are a self-declared state, one must not conflat being anti-Israel with being anti-Jewish (or really even anti-Israeli.)  The Israeli government is actually run by a very small number of people.  This is not at all unlike being against US foreign policy, for example, that doesn&#39;t make a person un-American or anti-American.  I find your argument primitive, overly general and most un-clever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a lot of us here there are two completely different trains of thought regarding Jews and Zionists. Zionism is politically motivated and is responsible for much of the terrorism around the world as well as the terrorist factions that created Israel. Judaism is a religion. Some of us are anti-religion. That means anti-Christian, anti-Muslim <em>and</em> anti-Jew. It&#39;s a completely different argument. However, there are also a lot of Christian Zionists as well as Jewish Zionists and that makes each of those two groups doubly hateful and for two different reasons.</p>
