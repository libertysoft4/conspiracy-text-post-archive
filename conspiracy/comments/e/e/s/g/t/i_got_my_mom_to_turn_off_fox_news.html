<p>Both my parent&#39;s and pretty much all of my extended family are (fox) news addicts. It goes on when they wake up and stays on all day whether its being watched or not. I&#39;m a long time advocate (possibly too much) of avoiding mainstream media when it comes to politics and I try my best to avoid political discussions at all costs. I think the ones sided view points, essential brain washing, the hatred and arguments most media brings about are unhealthy and yet longtime viewers believe anything they&#39;re told by their news of choice, no matter how one sided it is.</p>

<p>After a long discussion last night my Mom told me that she&#39;d take my challenge of picking one program a day if she feels like she has to see it and not having it on in the background for one month. She called me this morning to tell me that after the points i had made last night she noticed within 5 minutes of watching exactly what I was talking about and said she&#39;s going all of December with no Fox news.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#39;d share.</p>

<p>EDIT: just a random update. right now this has 37 upvotes and 14 downvotes. i really don&#39;t care if i do well in the world of reddit. i consider everyone on here friends not enemies. I&#39;m really interested to know whats on the mind of the downvoters. not as an attack. but because im interested. there has been all positive comments for the most part. at least leave a comment if you&#39;re going to downvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good question. i think there&#39;s a couple main things to bring up to someone thats gotten themselves way to wrapped up in the soap opera of its all. also keeping in mind the excuse i hear 99% of the time is &quot;well i just want to keep myself informed&quot;.</p>

<p>-if someone came to you with 100% opposite view points politically, would they ever be able to sway you?</p>

<p>-if you tried to express your political opinions on someone with the opposite opinions would you ever be able to make an impact on them? would they even listen?</p>

<p>-is there anything you can do or have done with your political opinions to directly affect anything? anything that has happened or will happen?</p>

<p>i think the answer for all of these for most (if they&#39;re being honest) is no. so then why all the wasted time watching when you know that all of the networks have opposing view points and there&#39;s no way to tell who is right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe i can shed some light...you see a couple generations ago, the news used to be about hard reporting, cracking cases, investigative journalism and support of the little guy(me and you, assuming you are not in the top 2% of earning in this country, or a big corporation paying their bills) but since this had a negative effect on business(ie their advertisers) and commerce in general(americans going out and spending money on mindless things), the media has shyed away from reporting hard facts and focused more on dumbing down and ignoring the root problems infecting most stories(dishonest dealings, shady business practices, backroom dealings, etc etc) crossing the headlines.  </p>

<p>To be honest most of what you see on tv is filtered news..talking points if you will, that serve no good or enable critical thinking or action or support of free thought.  All thought(or viewpoints) are controlled, managed and manipulated through talking heads and puff news pieces provided by the MSM companies (ie fox, nbc, abc, cbs, cnn, reuters - just look at who owns these outlets and you can see their agendas in their owners - remember it all revolves around money, not your well being or improved enlightment).  It also has seemed to spill over into newspapers and magazines as well.  But what are you gonna do, everyone has their price and the main stream media people have sold out to a higher ideology than what news services should do...stand up for the masses and not the people paying their paychecks...in a non capitalistic society this would probably not be such an issue (one could speculate)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DUDE i think we share the same size shoes! like i said im new to /conspiracy so i never saw your post, but holy crap. </p>

<p>for so many years i got the same treatment. one time i got into an argument with my dad (who i have a really healthy relationship with) that i thought was going to turn into a fist fight. it pretty much came down to him telling me George Bush was a Christian so i should fully back him and he&#39;s right about everything. its weird when you accept to just not accept what your told by liars and try to have that conversation with someone that has blinders on, it goes horribly wrong. </p>

<p>im not a genius with this stuff. i think i got lucky with my mom and im going to keep it up. if you ever wanna talk about stuff or get a second opinion, by all means pm me. i got your back.</p>

<p>i hope you dont mind if i use some of the links people submitted from your post in the future.</p>

<p>also anyone reading this click getnit01&#39;s link above. he&#39;s got some of the same crap going on too. (also upvote bc he&#39;s a cool guy)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the conversation has been started a lot of times, but never ending in my favor. after a couple conversations with like minded people i took another whack at it again after at least a year. someone somewhere on reddit while discussing all the wikileaks stuff made the point that its the medias responsibility, through honest reporting, to keep the government in check. we all know they haven&#39;t been doing that, at least not in my lifetime. and that really struck a chord with me when it came to thinking about the people i love and what they invest in what chalks up to be like some kind of false god. </p>

<p>My mom and dad, brother and last remaining grandparent have been avid fox addicts for probably around a decade to 15 years now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im going to work her into that stuff. i hadnt seen that video so thank you. the 9/11 stuff is really what got me thinking about any of this stuff with an open mind in the first place. unfortunetly so much time has passed since 2001. so many people are set in what the believe about it on an emotional level. and the media has spun it enough that anyone who thinks its an inside job is a wacko. </p>

<p>i think that if i can open her up enough to accept the truth about major media her eyes might be open to reevaluating other things shes come to accept because she&#39;s been told they were the truth.</p>
