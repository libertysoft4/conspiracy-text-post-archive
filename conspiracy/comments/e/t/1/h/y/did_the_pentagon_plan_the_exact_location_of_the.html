<p>Here are pictures that I got long ago by searching Google Images for &quot; Pentagon &quot; back in 2002  They came from a Pentagon page labeled &quot; contingency plan &quot; as I recall.  I was shocked ,   then I spread the pictures and the now defunct link around.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I think their discussion was like.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm... &quot; they said, Where should we crash that plane? </p>

<p>Not here,  too close to VIP&#39;s </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/rI2lK">http://imgur.com/rI2lK</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Ii6ig">http://imgur.com/Ii6ig</a></p>

<p>&quot;No , Not here, No place for emergency vehicles and cleanup crew&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OK That means we should crash it here.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/pieM5">http://imgur.com/pieM5</a></p>

<p>&quot; Yes, That&#39;s it.  That will be just right.   Now we have most of a year to prepare the area&quot; 
( these photo&#39;s were made the day of the 2000 election.)</p>

<p>&quot;Now Mark the exact trajectory on the lawn for practice and to help make the plan idiot proof&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please explain that to me. You are saying that some people from far away were controlling the airplane, right? And they were using GPS to determine position. And they used a &quot;vector&quot; (I know what vector means, I don&#39;t know what it means in this context). So how would it make sense to have a line on the ground a few score meters in length? At that point at that speed either they see the Pentagon or they are not going to see the line in the grass. </p>

<p>No, probably not--it was probably either controlled by
a computer on board which had been fed the vector
and co-coordinates we are talking about, or from an identical plane on a
slightly different vector (which would explain the contradictory
sightings by a large number of equally reliable witnesses as
to the exact flight path)--or by the elint plane the pentagon
inadvertantly admitted to the existence of to a congressional committee back around
06.  </p>

<p>Or maybe all three, just to be sure.  There are, I believe, about 200 pilots
now, who have signed on to the pilot 9/11 web site, many of whom
have flown the airplane involved, who flatly deny that they could
make a 7x7 go 500 miles an hour 20 feet from the ground, and hit
a building dead square horizontal after a 5g 10000 ft turning descent.<br/>
Much less a couple of goat-herders
who flunked cessna 172 touch-and-gos.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll bet a computer, with it&#39;s much faster reflexes, or a couple of co-ordinating computers + a
fly-by-wire human, could, however.</p>

<p>I doubt it was some vision system focusing on a line in the grass. I am amazed that you think that somehow since all those pilots could not fly the plane that a computer could do a better job. The best way to run plane like that is give it the final destination and a GPS. And GPS technology was 20 years old in 2001.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Computers don&#39;t eyeball. And the Pentagon itself gives you a much better target. The &quot;vector&quot; is the line from the plane to the Pentagon, not some short line in the ground. The only way to see the line in the photo is from directly above or from up close. It could not serve any possible purpose..</p>

<p>So what? Do you know anything about vision control systems? They don&#39;t use lines, they use landmarks. And GPS is far better. In fact, do you know anything about navigation? You take where you are and the destination and determine you heading from that. </p>

<p>Get rid of grass?  That looks like football field chalk to me.
Since the line was there in one day, and gone the next, what

<blockquote>

<p>Give me a break.  I come from a 3-generation construction family,
you use chalk on the ground, on wood pieces, on raw construction
surfaces, on cement platforms to layout plumbing, HVAC, &amp; electrical
conduit cutouts.  Have you not observed the chalk indicators city
workers use ubiquitously to discover &amp; mark out for construction
crews where and how to dig up streets? In one of those pictures
there are firefighters pretending to fight a fire--and you don&#39;t think
they might have had a reason, valid in your mind or not, to want
an indication laid on the ground as to whereall around the
building they should be setting up their fire evolution?  I&#39;m sorry,
but I&#39;m finding this argument of yours pretty lame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are begging the question here. 
You have to show it has something to do with the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I really don&#39;t.  The line is there, co-incident with the pictures
of some group apparently planning an attack on the pentagon, and
when they are gone, the line is gone.  Whether the line is useful
or not, they pretty obviously wanted it there.  The line is also
apparently remarkably close to the actual flight path of the
plane that hit the pentagon.  These are interesting facts, whether
or not any of your arguments about the use of the line mean
diddely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I know of the energy involved in the plane and that light

<p>So,...let me get this straight--you know from some math you&#39;ve done
that a steel streetlight pole is lighter and less dangerously configured to a jet than a
goose?   Would you mind posting that math?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You wrote: &quot;What if I wanted to make sure there were lots of flyover witnesses ...

<p>Go the to bottom of the class.  I&#39;m not suggesting the line itself might have
been intended to be viewed.  Obviously it was not.  Is that really what you

<blockquote>
<p>So you think the line could be to have as many witnesses as possible or as 
few. It is a miracle line, able to do everything and the opposites as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you fooled me for a while into thinking you were about to carefully read
what I wrote, and respond thoughtfully.
You asked for some possible reasons for the line.  Both of those
are possible reasons for the line.  I cannot read the minds of the planners in
those pictures.  And I cannot give you lessons in parsing sentence structure or
the sequential logic of paragraph construction.  If you want to have an argument, stop going off half-cocked.  I&#39;ve scarce
interest in supporting arguments I&#39;ve not  made.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve responded 3 times now, and I haven&#39;t the foggiest idea what you are
even arguing about.   Do you have a thesis, or are you just idling away an
evening looking for a good fight?</p>

<p>Get rid of grass? That looks like football field chalk to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is at least 5 feet wide and likely wider. Look at the roads and the path. It is wider than the path. And not a particularly good chalk line at that, it wiggles and had changes in intensity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the line was there in one day, and gone the next, what makes you think any grass died?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I am confused. Do you have the date for the satellite photo? I find it rather amazing that we just happen to have the photo of the one day this line existed. And if it was chalk and gone the &quot;next day&quot; then simple watering would make it disappear. Yet you claim there was a deliberate effort with trucks to hide it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I come from a 3-generation construction family, you use chalk on the ground, on wood pieces, on raw construction surfaces, on cement platforms to layout plumbing, HVAC, &amp; electrical conduit cutouts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are not talking about a construction job, though. Sure, if you are putting up a wall or digging something you might use a chalk line. (I doubt those chalk lines would show up on a satellite photo.) But this was not for a construction job. It was somehow to let people plan where a plane was going to fly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In one of those pictures there are firefighters pretending to fight a fire--</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretending? Now the fire is fake? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and you don&#39;t think they might have had a reason, valid in your mind or not, to want an indication laid on the ground as to whereall around the building they should be setting up their fire evolution? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you miss my point. You are trying to convince me that the U.S. government was behind the Pentagon attack. You have presented evidence you claim supports your claim. I say you evidence does no such thing. Even if I agreed with you that the Pentagon was behind the attack I would say your evidence does not support the claim. </p>

<p>Instead of showing how this &quot;line&quot; means the attack was planned you are saying <em>since</em> the attack was planned they needed planning tools, so therefore they would have used this line to plan. That is backwards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>co-incident with the pictures of some group apparently planning an attack on the pentagon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only connection between the photos is you. You haven&#39;t even claimed they were from the same page. And how are they &quot;apparently&quot; planning an attack on the Pentagon? What do you see in the pictures I don&#39;t see that says attack?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether the line is useful or not, they pretty obviously wanted it there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That someone at some point wanted some line is not evidence of planning for an attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you know from some math you&#39;ve done that a steel streetlight pole is lighter and less dangerously configured to a jet than a goose? Would you mind posting that math?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A light pole will not get into and jam the engine. And by that point in the flight the engines are not really doing much. Engine failure 100 feet form impact won&#39;t change anything. What I know is that a pole will collapse if a car hits it and the plane has a bit more momentum. The issue with geese is that they get sucked into the engine and jam it and the plane loses power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You asked for some possible reasons for the line. Both of those are possible reasons for the line. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It it could be to have lots of witnesses or none then it can do anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot read the minds of the planners in those pictures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet your argument rests on magically knowing they were planning the attack.</p>

<p>If you will look carefully, I do not suggest that.  What I suggest,
as it is plainly obvious, is that when we see the next sat. photo, the
trucks and plane parts and the line are all gone.  Without metrics
on the sat. photos, I can&#39;t say they went the next day, which in
fact I did not.  Your point is correct, for what it&#39;s worth, we can&#39;t
say when all this stuff disappeared without more knowledge about
the sat. photos, however, If you want to keep me responding, don&#39;t put
words in my mouth that weaken my statement so you can attack
it more vigorously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only connection between the photos is you. You haven&#39;t

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve no idea which photos you are talking about, but I will take a stab.
The reason that there&#39;s a connection between the sat. photos and
the crash drill photos is that the line is also visible in the fire fighting
drill picture.  Which is something I believe the op pointed out when
he posted the pictures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That someone at some point wanted some line is not 
evidence of planning for an attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe not, but they said they were planning an attack DRILL, according
to the op who rescued the photos and posted them here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet your argument rests on magically knowing they were 
planning the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t.  It rests on what was reported to me by the op, that
they openly said they were planning an attack drill, which it certaily looks like, and the curious fact
that there is a line, &amp; fire trucks, co-incident with said drill (dispute your rather
ludicrous attempts to distract from said co-incidence by flapping your wings
like a chicken with it&#39;s head cut off) that just happens to be just about
aligned with the fllight path on 9/11.  Sure, it might all just be
an extra-ordinary coincidence.  But you can&#39;t make that certainly
so just be bleating about it convincingly.  And I&#39;m getting pretty fed
up with the mounting number of extra-ordinary coincidences that
seem to have taken place on 9/11, so I have no compunction about
looking at this and mulling it over as much as I please.</p>

the sat. photos are not part of the set supplied proudly by the

<p>If I had meant that, I&#39;d have said &quot;the line was up for one day&quot;</p>

<p>I was pointing out, perhaps not as well as I might have, that the two satellite images demonstrate that
the line, and all the disaster drill evidence were all there in the first
photo, and all gone in the second.   Absent dates for the sat. images,
this is not terribly compelling data, but it isn&#39;t a refutation either.  I do not
know how long it took to put that line up, or how long it was there, and
did not intend to express an opinion on the subject, only to note that
they were all the evidence was there in one satellite image, and all gone
in the next.</p>

<p>Which does bracket these events together to some mild degree.</p>

<p>No my claim is that it is not uncommon to make such marks, in any
number of ways--I&#39;m not particularly hung up on chalk, except for
a certain personal fondness--for
many reason during staging and construction of any sort of complicated
event, including stage plays and ballets, even.  And it is far from
unreasonable to imagine putting such a line down for people planting
random airplane parts and parking fire vehicles to simulate a disaster
to align themselves with along the assumed path of the incoming
source of the disaster.</p>

<p>Your argument is entirely irrelevant and you should drop it.  I don&#39;t

but I know it was there during the planning of a disaster very like
the 9/11 disaster, and in
roughly the same direction and location as the flight path of the
plane on 9/11, and, wiggle as you will, laying such a line down would
be a natural thing to do, and most people do it, if you were trying to hfake an air crash
with a bunch of people and big things moving around.</p>

<p>And you know that how?  The tops of light poles are just
as high or higher than we&#39;ve been tolld the 747 traveled
on approach.  And it gored the side of the Pentagon at
the lowest point how
high up on the wall?  10 feet from the ground?, if that? 
Just the top part of a standard streetlight is still heaver
than a goose, and quite a lot more sprawling and angular,

<p>Heavy is not the issue. Geese are small and they squish up jam things. And it takes a bunch of them to jam an engine. But if the engines were off it would not have made much of a difference at that point.</p>

<p>But that time it would not matter in the slightest. By that time a full reverse on one side and full rudder would not have made a difference. The plane was going 500 mph. That means it covered the last mile in about 7 second. Changing the control surfaces would not do a thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, what did you have?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A line on the ground that is a close match for the
direction and location of the 9/11 event, which the
op maintains he found by researching into pre-9/11
sat. ops, and an openly advertised disaster drill, pre-9/11, that involved
putting airplane parts on the pentagon lawn, and included
a picture of planners hudding over what appears to be the same location on a model
of the pentagon where the plane collided.</p>

<p>Do I have proof?  No.  Do I have reasonable cause for suspicion?  Yes.   Do I have
reasonable enough cause to indict?  Maybe, in conjunction with NORAD lying to
the the 9/11 commission, making  up three different stories about why they
couldn&#39;t defend the Pentagon.  On those grounds alone, the Chief Council of the
9/11 commission wanted to indict for perjury.</p>

<p>There is also the extra-ordinary fact that this same Pentagon managed to fill
the sky with a cart-load of disaster drills being performed too far away to be
of aid that very day, &amp; failed to authorize launches of ready aircraft on the east coast
even with air force base generals watching the CNN coverage of the twin
towers &amp; begging for permission, until too  late, and will not release any but
a tiny piece of one video of the event, and waited until 06 to admit (inadvertantly
to a congressional committee), that they had a surveillance &amp; control plane in the
area--probably the distant white plane in some of the videos.</p>

<p>Which is why, in fact, I think you ought to feel an obligation, if you are a plain old
honest human, to suggest why this drill
could not have been a prelude to  9/11.  I think the net evidence of malfeasance of
some sort is good enough to indict and start a prosecutorial investigation, and
the  chief council for the 9/11 commission agrees, and I think this drill would be
accepted  in court as prosecutorial evidence, which you have not countered with
anything  of sufficient weight to throw it out--the fact is, there are coincidences
here that would seem more than random to a typical juror or prosecutor--your
niggling distractions and counter-evidence that, at base, consists of your
theoretical opinions, to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The satellite view. It shows the exact trajectory and crash point by a line marked on the grass. Who would ever see it and know what it represented before the crash and it was destroyed almost immediately afterward. However I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t consider that a satellite image would make it onto the Internet and be saved.</p>

<p>The people inside the building know exactly where they are. They don&#39;t need either a line or a GPS. What building do you think these people are in? And how is that line going to help? I seriously don&#39;t grasp what you are trying to say. If the plane is not in the right place how will the line help? If you can see the line you can see the building. I can&#39;t imagine some situation where having that line would help me guild an airplane to some point.</p>

<p>How so? When is the photo from and how can we tell which side of the Pentagon we are looking at?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calibration was critical . This shot had to be very very precise .People inside the building needed a hard reference point as well as the attack guidance system did.  They needed to , and did , take out the computers that held the information about 2.2 TRILLION dollars that Donald Rumsfeld had announced on the front page of the newspapers the day before, had been lost or unaccounted for. This attack got rid of the evidence and drowned out the news of the lost trillions. Unless the first news report of the day is to be believed  in which I heard my television report that &quot; Something has happened at the Pentagon.

In my opinion that was because the scene needed modification by adding the &#39;plane parts&#39; and they needed to do that with no one knowing it was being done. Simple . Just move the parts from inside the building towards the lawn and people will think you are just clearing out debris from the center towards the outside of the area.</p>

<p>What building do you mean? Are you saying that people inside the Pentagon needed the line to guild the missile/airplane to hit the Pentagon? I don&#39;t see how that makes any sense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I heard on 9/11 that a missile had hit the WTC. And that a small plane had hit. I also heard the truck bomb at the Pentagon site. Here is a possibility, people were reporting what they heard when they heard it and we got stories that were wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that people inside the Pentagon needed the line to guild the missile/airplane to hit the Pentagon?
No , more likely they wanted to place the documents that pertained to 2.2 trillion missing dollars in the exact line of fire.  The result, I understand was a  bullseye.</p>

<p>So was the line to guide a plane or not?</p>

<p>No and I have explained to the best of my ability that it was probably a key visual aid during further planning. I&#39;m not an insider. The people in the photo&#39;s were and they deserve to be able to respond to your questions concerning the photo&#39;&#39;s </p>

<p>Except for the very large number of people in the site</p>

<p>If there was anyone at the site that shouldn&#39;t have known what was up it would be very simple to just move something from storage inside the building, near the explosion site  (or wherever) to a place where it would be included as evidence of the plane crashing. During your torrent of questions,let me ask you this one . </p>

<p>Which one of these is capable of instantly disappearing, an airliner or a missile, Take a look.</p>

<p>Sorry, how does it make more sense to build that line than to just point out the window or area involved? How about this, can you find some example of someone doing anything like that to aim an airplane/missile? Anyone digging up the grass like that to plane something? I don&#39;t see how the line does anything that a line on a map would not do at least as well.</p>

<p>Just in case you&#39;re not  I&#39;ll give it to you again. I feel generous and you are helping me to feel generous. Thanks! it feels good.</p>

<p>The mark is visible from the inside of the Pentagon,</p>

<p>from the outside of the Pentagon  </p>

<p>and from space. </p>

<p>Yet it never, until today, drew any attention.</p>

<p>It was also  very easily and publicly  erased when the time came.</p>

<p>Get the BIG picture now? It&#39;s just a straight lawn  line.  </p>

<p>Hell maybe they wanted to play horseshoes on the trajectory line that bin Laden was going to attack us on. Is that your claim? and the Pentagon felt generous too by marking the way for him. </p>

<p>That&#39;s rich matt.</p>

<p>Im making fun of ya&#39; boy.</p>

<p>I reiterate Co-ordination would be a goal wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>.  Getting everyone on the same page even if they weren&#39;t technically oriented by making a simple innocent looking mark on the grass and then, regardless of whether they worked inside, outside, or in an aircraft. They could see and be confident of where the projectile would hit.</p>

<p>Now they could  all commit treason together in peace and harmony.  &lt;grin&gt;</p>

<p>Any damn fool could look out the window and know that the projectile will hit</p>

<p>( HERE -------------------&gt;)</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s where you put that bank of damning computers. The ones with the 2.3 trillion dollar secrets. not twenty or so feet over to the left.</p>

<p>Understand any of this yet? </p>

<p>Greed is a power unto itself.</p>

<p>That line in the grass would be  damned useful if one was  planning an attack on some computer information by a missile and  needed to hit it directly, 
We didn&#39;t want anyone repairing that damned set of hard drives now did we matt2 ? Because Then everybody would know.</p>

<p>An airliner  would never be precise enough to trust as the projectile. ground turbulence and all of that, unless it was computer guided.</p>

<p>So here is the missile exploding. You can tell it&#39;s a missile because there is not a shade of tail section or wings to be seen.There is only a round explosion.  Just like , well a round explosion from a missile being fired at the wall.</p>

<p>The flame you see here is so close to its beginning that it hasn&#39;t even had time to assume a flame shape yet  but the &quot; plane &quot; is totally gone already. </p>

<p>This is a very serious question for you matt. </p>

<p>Which one disappears instantly matts2,  a missile or a giant airliner? </p>

<p>Come on bud, you know the answer to this. So which one is this now , honestly?</p>

You fail to put the &#39;&gt;&#39; in front of the quotes and you put my comments on the same line you respond to. I seem to have made a mistake due to your failure to post properly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are making fun of yourself. You have yet to provide a single sensible notion for how the line suggests anything about the attack. You have yet to show any evidence of when the line was there and when it was removed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I reiterate Co-ordination would be a goal wouldn&#39;t it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coordinating what? And how does the line help coordination? Your idea is that it was a great big secret known only to anyone who was in the Pentagon or near it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Or just hang something in a window. </p>

<p>I don[t see how in the world it would be. Repeating that it would be does not show the use. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>An airliner would never be precise enough to trust as the projectile. ground turbulence and all of that, unless it was computer guided.</p>

<p>There is no possible way the line would help any computer guidance. None. The line is not visible from miles away on an angle, it could not possible guide someone in. Seriously, take a second and think about this. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So how did the line help the missile? The missile would use GSP and not need anything on the ground. And if it did it would use landmarks miles away. A line right outside the Pentagon is utterly useless.</p>

I don&#39;t need it attributed or copied exactly or anything . Just send a link.</p>

<p>Edit, The  notion put forward  here  would explain how the airliner parts that were not there in the early morning photo got planted. </p>

<p>Since they apparently planned it over at least a 10 month period they would simply walk the plane parts out onto the lawn from inside the hole in the  building after the explosion and to any witness it would look for all the world like they were just clearing out rubble from the affected area when they were actually planting &quot; evidence&quot; </p>

<p>I can easily see how the &#39;engine part &#39; was carried just a few feet before the person planting it said &#39;fuck it leave it here&#39;, and the photo of the &#39;evidence&#39; was taken at that point to &#39;prove&#39; that an airliner crashed there.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think they put photos of the people planning the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon on-line. Why exactly would they have such a secret plan and have a photographer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was after 9/11 and I felt as if I was being led to believe something false. A scam. all I knew of 9/11 had a stink of lies.</p>

<p>Wanting to know more I approached the mighty Internet and I entered the very useful public tool called Google, and journeyed  into the sub-directory called Images. I issued the term &quot;Pentagon&quot; and I ,</p>

<p>Alone,</p>

<p>Unarmed,</p>

<p>Completely unskilled in the ways of the hacker,</p>

<p>and seeking only pictures of  the tragedy of 9/11 which I suspected was a fraud.</p>

<p>I found the Pentagon itself. Astonishingly, I found it </p>

<p>UNGUARDED!!</p>

<p>After 9/11!!</p>

<p>It had no kind of ,                            warning,security,password,monitoring,challenge of &#39;who goes there&#39;  Nothing. </p>

<p>Click, You&#39;re in.</p>

<p>It was utterly unguarded and open through Google to anyone who was interested. </p>

<p>Yet here they were as if I was their mother and I had caught them  masturbating,  showing me that they had both foreknowledge and pre-planning.  and then  I continued on my look through all pictures that called themselves for what ever reason &quot; Pentagon&quot; and I found a  satellite picture that was of the lawn of the Pentagon with what appears to be a very damning line that mimics in every way a precise  map for the terrorists (sic) to follow with their projectile and to use to align their target.</p>

<p>In answer to your question 
 The photographer was probably there to commemorate the big treasonous event.  </p>

<p>Yippee!`We bombed our own country and I helped! </p>

<p>Everybody do the fascist fugue !!</p>

<p>If you want to imply that this is weak evidence , fine I have piles and piles of evidence just as damning , There is so much in fact that you have to willfully  refuse to be able to understand when you have been attacked, in order to continue to support the government s story. The case is obvious and way over the top obvious. I will continue as long as you like after a little sleep. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you find those images on the Pentagon website? If so, why is that all that meaningful? Guarding the public facing website is not all that important for them.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t get how you connect those pictures to the attack. Why do you think they have anything at all to do with 9/11?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That means something very different to me than to you. Piles of evidence that don&#39;t mean anything still means nothing. You have pictures of people in a room with a model of the Pentagon. Big deal. You have some line on the lawn which I still can&#39;t see how it would do a damn thing to help in planning anything. </p>

<p>It seems to me your point is that you made up your mind and you found evidence to confirm.</p>

<p>im sure the White House, Capitol hill etc all have the same but i guess there will be no conspiracy until something happens.</p>

<p>also are we not believing it was a missile now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this evidence is really strong. Some photos from a training exercise in which men whose job it is to predict what sort of attacks the Pentagon might face, uh, predict what sort of attacks the Pentagon might face.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like they <em>knew</em> there was a possibility the Pentagon would be attacked someday, and were doing their jobs to make sure contingencies were in place to deal with such an attack! How evil!</p>

<p>This is the reason truthers aren&#39;t taken seriously. Not because the evidence is lacking (although it is), not because people don&#39;t want to uncover the truth (we&#39;re globally obsessed with these sorts of conspiracies and would love to uncover one for real), but because most of you are fucking idiots who make up insane, literally insane, stories -- <em>and believe them</em>.</p>
