    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the fact that it <em>is</em> pretty much proven through a multitude of smaller pieces of evidence (the only thing left would be a detailed confession from someone inside, highly unlikely given the CIA&#39;s tactics), even if there was some huge bit of damning evidence that the gov&#39;t couldn&#39;t even ignore, it simply would be almost never mentioned in mainstream media. Like building 7. There is already a lot of evidence that most people wouldn&#39;t know about because they get all their news from the MSM.</p>

<p>Just like with other definitive pieces of evidence in various government issues, you will see a large internet outcry as if something&#39;s about to really be done about it, and on TV it&#39;s just another day, another dollar, another advertisement, &quot;those damn hackers are at it again&quot;, rinse and repeat. My favorite part is how they do everything they can to discredit the internet&#39;s opinion on everything even though we are all real fucking people. All of a sudden everyone with these real questions for our government are being put into the same category as pirates, hackers, and leakers. </p>

<p>The wikileaks/Julian Assange scandal BS on TV is an excellent example of this. They are actually successfully calling us the enemies and getting mainstream Americans to hate leakers and people that actually want some transparency in our system. TV was already terrible before I stopped watching in &#39;06, but this is a new level of social manipulation that makes me sick to my stomach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid that nothing will happen. The beauty of the Bush administration was that it didn&#39;t really hide things from the public, they just didn&#39;t care. Protests were easily ignored by the American media so all truth could be out there it just wasn&#39;t reported. I was amazed at how much the UK papers covered the goings on in Washington and what was being done and then find nothing on the American side. When you run the media the majority of people will never know and the minority of people looking and reporting are considered quacks. Nothing would happen. Twin Towers Building 7 collapsed straight down just like the Twin Towers but 5 hours later and there is no reasonable explanation for that. No one cares.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It still amazes me that the Bushies weren&#39;t run out of town, but you&#39;re exactly right - they hid NOTHING. They didn&#39;t tell a whole lot of lies. Everything was out in the open, but under the guise of nationalism and fear mongering, people turned a blind eye. Most of the supporters of the Bushies knew the truths, but ignored them for fear that the next 9-11 would come in the form of a mushroom cloud. Nevermind that the policies of this administration led to an increase in militancy on the middle east, but nothing brings a country together like war, eh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to get sidetracked, so I&#39;ll stick to the question.  I think your question is valid, even if just from a purely hypothetical standpoint.  </p>

<p>Naturally there would be those demanding justice, but what else?  Do we repeal the patriot act?  Does someone audit every piece of legislation that&#39;s been rammed through since then?<br/>
I guess it would depend on how things came to light.  Major changes would have to be made to the system, through legislation.  You&#39;d need something like an actual patriot act, instead of just a &quot;patriot&quot; act.  Maybe watchdog agencies would need to be created to ensure oversight and root out conspirators (at the highest levels).   We&#39;d need to consider major fundamental flaws with how one or many branches of our government operate, and evaluate which checks &amp; balances failed, and why.  </p>
