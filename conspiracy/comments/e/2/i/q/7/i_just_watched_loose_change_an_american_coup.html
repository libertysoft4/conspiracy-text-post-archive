Not in a negative way, but people just close up and they don&#39;t want to talk about it.  It seems so helpless to think that we are powerless to bring any change or redirection to the world.  If these events discussed in movies such as Loose Change are true, then why isn&#39;t there a push to bring about justice, to find truth, or an overwhelming feeling of being pissed off at anything and anyone that had something to do with it.  WT7 is the biggest fucking elephant in the room when 9/11 is discussed and everyone just ignores it.  WTF is going on here and how can we stop it?  I seriously can&#39;t even put my words together on how I feel about all of this, because it&#39;s just so massive and no one wants to really talk about it.  Just thought I&#39;d rant and randomly throw out my thoughts, thanks /conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CIA activities in Iran, Nicaragua, Chile, and other covert actions are WELL DOCUMENTED. The 9/11 conspiracy has no facts whatsoever to its merit. Also, Pearl Harbor? Are you really suggesting that that was orchestrated by our government?</p>

<p>Presidents can achieve their foreign policy objectives without having to resort to massive slaughter of US citizens. The Gulf of Tonkin is a good example. Why would the Bush Administration need to kill 3000 Americans in a terrorist attack when they could achieve their objectives through a Tonkin-like incident where no Americans were killed?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Howard_Hunt#JFK_Conspiracy_allegations_and_Death">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Howard_Hunt#JFK_Conspiracy_allegations_and_Death</a></p>

<p>The JFKII documentary was made in 2003 and goes to great lengths to implicate E. Howard Hunt. Hunt died in 2007, and allegedly confessed on his deathbed to having been involved in the plot to kill JFK along with others, including LBJ... and everyone ignored him.</p>

<p>&quot;Melted Steel&quot; has been explained. FYI, it was aluminum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither pancake nor melted steel has been demonstrated as being possible, and in fact in several different experiments deliberately trying to recreate the incident (which is much easier when you have a goal...) they were unable to reproduce the effect.</p>

<p>NIST also explicitly says they were unable to demonstrate that the effect is possible even with external stimulus.  It&#39;s right in the report and in subsequent reports.  Many NIST researchers and officials (I believe the number is seven now that have made public statements to the effect) have said that the report completely failed to prove that the buildings were felled by the planes or whom might have done so.  But then, that&#39;s no surprise... because the report says so, itself.</p>

<p>You&#39;re under a complete misconception.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Molten substance came out of one side of one of the towers. This also happened to be the opposing side from whence the plane impacted, meaning all the debris was there up against the wall. The fire easily burned enough to melt aluminum, which the plane is made of. Aluminum was pancaked into the wall. The fire melted the aluminum, which eventually dripped out.</p>

<p>The molten was aluminum.</p>

<p>Pancake has been demonstrated as being possible, but I guess you would arrive at a different conclusion if you don&#39;t give both sides equal credence.</p>

The fire in question where molten was seen dripping would have been one of the hottest fires burning, as it was directly opposing the impact zone. That&#39;s where all the stuff went.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what Thermite is? It is a substance used in a number of commercial and military uses, particularly demolition because of the fantastic heat it generates, cutting through reinforced steel like a hot knife through butter.</p>

<p>The two main components of thermite are iron oxide, (rust) and aluminum. Traces of a special compound used only in the military grade thermite &quot;thermate&quot; were found literally blowing in the breeze after the towers fell. There were pools of molten metal still bubbling away in the wreckage weeks after the fact, which I somehow doubt could be attributed to the jet fuel.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the pancake theory is fatally flawed because of one piece of evidence; the buildings collapse at free-fall speed, as though there is nothing at all to slow it down, not even the rest of the building.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the pools of molten metal are explainable. Here is my take on it: if there really was pools of molten metal, which of some eyewitnesses testify to, who&#39;s to say how they got there? Molten metal at the bottom impact zone of buildings of that height falling down on top of themselves.... Yeah, seems to me that it would be common sense that the heat generation created from the buildings coming down would easily be enough to create substantial amounts of molten at ground zero.</p>

<p>Also, as for the thermite idea - do you realize how much thermite would be required for this? 2 lbs of thermite for every 1lb of steel you wish to burn through. And, we see no outer support beams affected by thermite burning prior to the collapse. Seems they are very good at controlling specifically where it was released despite the chaos. Again, consider the sheer amount of thermite you would need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not as though you need to plaster every pound of steel with two pounds of thermite. A series of charges placed in strategic locations could shear through major support columns with ease, bringing the building crashing down into itself just as it did.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting to note that the bomb-sniffing squads were removed from the buildings five days beforehand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never heard the bomb squad claim before.</p>

<p>And even so, lets say you wanted to knock out the central support area of the tower. You would ideally want to melt more than 1 area. Also, they really must have had a lot of control over when and where was melting. We see no external metals on the tower being affected by thermite burn. We see a single molten metal (id&#39;d as aluminum) dripping out of one corner of one of the towers - and again not melting steel around it at all.</p>

<p>Under such chaos its safe to say they wouldn&#39;t have the kind of control to conceal thermite burning from all the video footage we have.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Even if your only burning the center support area, you would have to do it in various locations, regardless of how strategic to ensure the desired effect. Again, requiring huge amounts of thermite.</p>

<p>The same can be said about the most popular conspiracy related claims pertaining to 9/11.</p>

<p>Freefall speed - that playlist I posted earlier covers that and shows the timing to not be freefall speed.</p>

<p>Pools of molten metal - it was just my idea on one way in which there could be a legitimate explanation for the pools of molten at ground zero after the collapses. And if you think about it, it makes physical sense. I&#39;m not saying its in fact what happened, I&#39;m saying here&#39;s an idea that makes sense pertaining to the laws of physics. And I&#39;m sure with ample research, I could find physicists that agree with me. Think about it. All that steel up in the air compounding on itself in a gigantic physical reaction. Can you even estimate the heat generation during the collapse itself? Surely it would be much higher than any fires that burned.</p>

<p>Also, there is debunking of the demolition theory in that same playlist, among many other important facts to consider. Additionally, it shows how the pancake happened. Which by the way, I can also pull up an independent study on showing how physics gravity and motion could cause the pancake effect of the floors toppling. However the explanations this person provides are good enough.</p>

<p>Quite simply, the idea that the top of the building would topple over is physically impossible. People think of a tree being impacted at the top and falling over and use this as &#39;proof&#39; that 9/11 was a demolition. When in fact, trees have roots underground, and are solid objects, whereas skyscrapers are not. Its in fact, impossible to even consider that the WTC buildings would topple over instead of pancaking during a catastrophic failure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, no.  There were pools of molten metal in the wreckage of the buildings, some of them very large.  There were also large sections of steel that could be observed to have been melted.  </p>

<p>Also, there is no real evidence to suggest that the heat inside the buildings was high enough to melt either steel or aluminum.  Jet fuel is equivalent to kerosene, and most of it was burnt almost instantly in the initial crash.  Kerosene yields a very low-heat flame and the amount of black smoke coming from the buildings shows that any flames that were there (and there clearly were, no denying that) would have been starved for air - which leads to the black, cool sooty smoke that you observe coming out of the buildings.</p>

<p>You have responded with a) an implausible - in many people&#39;s knowledgable opinion - theory of what the molten metal was and b) one which theorizes that a large amount of jet fuel entered the building; then burnt hot enough to show molten metal coming out of the building floors below the crash.  Observations of the explosions (and simple common sense) show that giant fireballs of fuel burnt most of the fuel off immediately and what entered the building was choked by black smoke - forcing various fuels inside the building to burn at a smouldering/cool pace.</p>

<p>Regarding the &quot;roots&quot; verbiage:  B.S.  Those buildings had giant steel girder roots into the ground several stories below the surface.  The buildings were built specifically to withstand aircraft impact.  Those were some very solid objects - or at least the cores were.  There is <em>nothing</em> to suggest that the buildings could pancake, particularly in the way that they did - NIST GOES RIGHT AHEAD AND SAYS SO IN THE REPORT and still we have to see mindless sheep repeat &quot;omg the buildings pancaked!&quot; here on the Internets ever day.</p>

<p>Secondly, the way about how the buildings came down makes physical sense. Even if it looks like a demolition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, everyone does <em>NOT</em> agree that the temperatures got that high.  In fact, the vast majority of people who understand anything at all about choked-cool fires which did <em>NOT</em> have a large amount of jet fuel to accelerate them (since the giant fireballs at impact were most of jet fuel payload) say that temperatures were nowhere near that.  It is clear from the amount and the thickness of the smoke that the fuels were smouldering hot inside the building, and mostly choked by a lack of denser oxygen... just will happen if your flue and/or oxygen vents are not set up properly in a wood stove. </p>

<p>If the fire was as hot as these people claim, how do you think it is possible that human beings were alive right at the opening of the plane impact - for at least an hour?  That kind of heat would parboil the survivors as it wafted upwards and out.  The radiation of that kind of heat spread over that much area would be fierce.  People didn&#39;t start jumping until the heat rising started fires in the upper levels and crept back out towards the opening where there was enough air to get a real fire going - those fires would have been good and hot because they had enough oxygen to oxidize the fuel quickly.</p>

<p>This is one of the real canards of the whole official farce.  By the way, oxy/acetylene torches used to cut and weld steel are in the 6400F range.  If you were not aware...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with molten metal is that it wasn&#39;t molten metal.</p>

<p>Edit: if your referring to the pools of molten metal at ground zero, this: Fourth, if there really was pools of molten metal, which of some eyewitnesses testify to, who&#39;s to say how they got there? Molten metal at the bottom impact zone of buildings of that height falling down on top of themselves.... Yeah, seems to me that it would be common sense that the heat generation created from the buildings coming down would easily be enough to create substantial amounts of molten at ground zero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do not confuse the origins of Loose Change and the evolution of Loose change.</p>

<p>To be precise, the intent of writer Dylan Avery circa 2002 was to write a fictional story about 9-11 being an inside job.  Supposedly, after researching the evidence, he began to think it might actually be the case.  So he published Loose Change as a defense of his position.</p>

<p>Loose Change was never a fictional story (nor a documentary about conspiracy theories).  That was the initial project <em>before</em> Loose Change.  The first Loose Change is already a defense of the position that it&#39;s an inside job.  The evolution of Loose Change is not due to the authors changing their minds, it is due to their having to adapt to contradicting evidence.  Without ever changing their core position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Matt Taibbi seems like the sanest person involved in an argument, something is seriously wrong.  However, this is a hilarious fucking debate-ender:
...................
BUSH: So, what&#39;s the plan again?</p>

<p>CHENEY: Well, we need to invade Iraq and Afghanistan. So what we&#39;ve decided to do is crash a whole bunch of remote-controlled planes into Wall Street and the Pentagon, say they&#39;re real hijacked commercial planes, and blame it on the towelheads; then we&#39;ll just blow up the buildings ourselves to make sure they actually fall down.</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: Right! And we&#39;ll make sure that some of the hijackers are agents of Saddam Hussein! That way we&#39;ll have no problem getting the public to buy the invasion.</p>

<p>CHENEY: No, Don, we won&#39;t.</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: We won&#39;t?</p>

<p>CHENEY: No, that&#39;s too obvious. We&#39;ll make the hijackers al-Qaeda and then just imply a connection to Iraq.</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: But if we&#39;re just making up the whole thing, why not just put Saddam&#39;s fingerprints on the attack?</p>

<p>CHENEY: (sighing) It just has to be this way, Don. Ups the ante, as it were. This way, we&#39;re not insulated if things go wrong in Iraq. Gives us incentive to get the invasion right the first time around.</p>

<p>BUSH: I&#39;m a total idiot who can barely read, so I&#39;ll buy that. But I&#39;ve got a question. Why do we need to crash planes into the Towers at all? Since everyone knows terrorists already tried to blow up that building complex from the ground up once, why don&#39;t we just blow it up like we plan to anyway, and blame the bombs on the terrorists?</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: Mr. President, you don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s much better to sneak into the buildings ourselves in the days before the attacks, plant the bombs, and then make it look like it was exploding planes that brought the buildings down. That way, we involve more people in the plot, stand a much greater chance of being exposed, and needlessly complicate everything!</p>

<p>CHENEY: Of course, just toppling the Twin Towers will never be enough. No one would give us the war mandate we need if we just blow up the Towers. Clearly, we also need to shoot a missile at a small corner of the Pentagon to create a mightily underpublicized additional symbol of international terrorism -- and then, obviously, we need to fake a plane crash in the middle of fucking nowhere somewhere in rural Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: Yeah, it goes without saying that the level of public outrage will not be sufficient without that crash in the middle of fucking nowhere.</p>

<p>CHENEY: And the Pentagon crash -- we&#39;ll have to do it in broad daylight and say it was a plane, even though it&#39;ll really be a cruise missile.</p>

<p>BUSH: Wait, why do we have to use a missile?</p>

<p>CHENEY: Because it&#39;s much easier to shoot a missile and say it was a plane. It&#39;s not easy to steer a real passenger plane into the Pentagon. Planes are hard to come by.</p>

<p>BUSH: But aren&#39;t we using two planes for the Twin Towers?</p>

<p>CHENEY: Mr. President, you&#39;re missing the point. With the Pentagon, we use a missile, and say it was a plane.</p>

<p>BUSH: Right, but I&#39;m saying, why don&#39;t we just use a plane and say it was a plane? We&#39;ll be doing that with the Twin Towers, right?</p>

<p>CHENEY: Right, but in this case, we use a missile. (Throws hands up in frustration) Don, can you help me out here?</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: Mr. President, in Washington, we use a missile because it&#39;s sneakier that way. Using an actual plane would be too obvious, even though we&#39;ll be doing just that in New York.</p>

<p>BUSH: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: The other good thing about saying that it was a passenger jet is that that way, we have to invent a few hundred fictional victims and account for a nonexistent missing crew and plane. It&#39;s always better when you leave more cover story to invent, more legwork to do, and more possible holes to investigate. Doubt, legwork, and possible exposure -- you can&#39;t pull off any good conspiracy without them.</p>

<p>BUSH: You guys are brilliant! Because if there&#39;s one thing about Americans -- they won&#39;t let a president go to war without a damn good reason. How could we ever get the media, the corporate world, and our military to endorse an invasion of a secular Iraqi state unless we faked an attack against New York at the hands of a bunch of Saudi religious radicals? Why, they&#39;d never buy it. Look at how hard it was to get us into Vietnam, Iraq the last time, Kosovo?</p>

<p>CHENEY: Like pulling teeth!</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: Well, I&#39;m sold on the idea. Let&#39;s call the Joint Chiefs, the FAA, the New York and Washington DC fire departments, Rudy Giuliani, all three networks, the families of a thousand fictional airline victims, MI-5, the FBI, FEMA, the NYPD, Larry Eagleburger, Osama bin Laden, Noam Chomsky and the fifty thousand other people we&#39;ll need to pull this off. There isn&#39;t a moment to lose!</p>

<p>BUSH: Don&#39;t forget to call all of those Wall Street hotshots who donated $100 million to our last campaign. They&#39;ll be thrilled to know that we&#39;ll be targeting them for execution as part of our thousand-tentacled modern-day bonehead Reichstag scheme! After all, if we&#39;re going to make martyrs -- why not make them out of our campaign paymasters? Shit, didn&#39;t the Merrill Lynch guys say they needed a refurbishing in their New York offices?</p>

<p>RUMSFELD: Oh, they&#39;ll get a refurbishing, all right. Just in time for the &quot;Big Wedding&quot;!</p>

<p>ALL THREE: (cackling) Mwah-hah-hah!</p>

<p>I would say that that&#39;s a point against the official conspiracy theorists. Another huge coincidence that the only passport found was found within an hour of the crash and just happened to belong to an alleged hijacker.

    <div class="md"><p>They also had connections to US intelligence. They were also being watched by FBI agents who were told to end their investigations. The video of them going through security was not at the airport that the final flights took off from but from the airports they originally debarked from prior to them allegedly making their connecting flights at Logan. They attended and <strong>failed</strong> flight school.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying they weren&#39;t on the planes but I do still consider that a possibility. I also consider the possibility that they were on the planes but that the planes were taken over by remote control and they had no idea they were to be killed. In other words, they may have been patsies. There were lots of other issues that point to that conclusion too.</p>

<p>This proves that you didn&#39;t really do much research. Even <em>if</em> the evidence that states the &quot;official story&quot; as being untrue is untrue itself, it surely is not &quot;way out of touch with reality&quot;. All contradicting evidence to the official story is completely 100% plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this may be hard for you to believe simce it seems so real in your mind, but there is absolutely no evidence of any sort of conspiracy whatsoever. I&#39;ve seen that movie, and they make it appear they have facts by making linking together a series of random events. They basically argue like creationists - they attempt to undermine the accepted fact by digging at the edges, hoping that with enough random and incoherent scraping they can destroy the whole thing. But the arguments and facts are never bluntly stated. Conspiracy theorists slip away like greased pigs when you try to nail down their facts and assumptions. </p>

<p>9/11 truthers are ridiculed by the mass media, rightly so, and so people are unwilling to discuss it. It would be better for you save yourself years of thought by abandoning these thoughts NOW. Inevitably, you will come to the conclusion that there was no conspiracy. Save yourself the time and emotional effort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your assumption that it would have taken a &quot;thousands-persons thick government conspiracy&quot; is not valid. It could have been accomplished with as few as 50-100 people knowing exactly what was up. And if they were mostly black ops agents of the CIA or Mossad they certainly wouldn&#39;t blab, assuming any of them lived more than a few days after the event.</p>

<p>Edit: Let&#39;s also not forget that three of the &quot;5 dancing Israelis&quot; went on Israeli national TV and actually said &quot;we were there to document the event&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The kind of operation necessary to do all of the things that the 9-11 truth movement implies would most certainly involve more than 50 to 100 hundred people. Think of the explosives that would be requires to &quot;bring down&quot; the Towers...literally, thousands of pounds that would not only need to be brought into the building, but drilled through walls and installed into the main support structure of the building, all without being noticed by say, ONE security guard who hadn&#39;t been killed/bought out/neural wiped, whatever. Unfortunately, it is a pure numbers game, and the odds of a successful conspiracy going off in silence goes down with every extra person involved. The Mossad and CIA may be all sorts of shady, but that doesn&#39;t mean they can pull off the impossible. And when there are millions of dollars of royalties on the line, you&#39;ll see at least one person&#39;s loyalty to their bank account win over. Simple story of human nature, folks. We&#39;re just not that clever, nor that iron-willed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Remotely impossible&quot; is not really a great way to judge the likelihood of an event like that. And since this is all conjecture anyway, it is impossible for either of us to come up with any &quot;real&quot; numbers.

The conspiracy version of 9-11 is simply too complex and involves too many ad hoc caveats to be truly plausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the people who believe the WTC was brought down by controlled demolition.  One question.  How did they place the explosives inside the building without anyone noticing?? It would have taken hundreds of people to pull this one job off, and after 10 years, NO ONE has talked, NO ONE has slipped up and talked about it???  NO ONE noticed that they were putting explosives in the towers??  I don&#39;t believe any of the conspiracy theories.  I also have a degree in mechanical engineering, and am finishing up my masters in civil, and the way the building collapsed makes sense to me.  Metals lose much of their strength when exposed to high heat, so the fact that the heat of the fuel burning is less than the melting point of metal is really meaningless.  The metal still lost much of its strength.  If it was a conspiracy, it would have come out by now.  It hasn&#39;t, so it wasn&#39;t.  Anyone care to comment before accusing me of being a dumbass who doesn&#39;t understand engineering???</p>

<p>In general, mechanical engineering designs are derated to withstand at least double the actual intended stress so I would bet that the structure at each floor was capable of supporting twice the actual weight above it. One could check NIST standards to verify if that applied to the towers. I don&#39;t have the time to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice.  Except that nobody has been able to model, prove or even remotely come close to actually showing the effects they claim in any modelled experiment.  It doesn&#39;t work that way.  NIST did the tests and tried their best to skew the results to prove their hypothesis - and failed.  So did MIT.  It pays to remember this... there are plenty of copies of the experiments that were funded by NIST available, and the sum total of their findings: THE THEORIES WERE EITHER WRONG OR SOME OTHER FORCE ACTED ON THE BUILDINGS.</p>

<p>The article that you posted and the Popular Mechanics articles are completely unsubstantiated in any applied testing that was done post-911.  It&#39;s all theory... and since you&#39;re attempting to fight reasoned theory with disproven theory... it&#39;s a bit vacuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s pretend for a moment that this wasn&#39;t an inside job, that 911 was actually caried out by muslim terrorists with a plane full of jet fuel.  This jet fuel is capable of weakning the steel at the higher levels by 90% as you earlier claimed.  Now by this theory, the top floors would most definetly be weakend, this is very clearly understood by you, by me and by most people here.  My only question is, why would the rest buckle?  Why would the lower floors also buckle under &quot;stress&quot;?  From my understanding of the official story, there really isn&#39;t anything weaking the lower floors.  Therefore they should have been MORE than able to withstand the weight of the top portion of the building  for which they were designed (plus human body weight, equipment weight etc..etc..) to hold.  The lower floors were designed to do this whether the top floors had collapsed or not.  If you can simply explain this one concept to me I would be flabbergasted.  Seriously, I would love a scholarly source showing how this could have happened.  My mind is open... prove your position.  Thank you.</p>

If you build a house of cards and set a quarter on top of it, it will probably hold up.  If you build a house of cards and THROW (it has momentum) a quarter on top of it, it will probably collapse including the lower floors.  This is very basic, but that&#39;s one way to see it.

<p>So as far as I can see, what you want to do is belittle others... while offering no factual information or citing any documents to disprove their opinions or related facts.  That&#39;s disengenuous... and you damned well know it.  Troll on...</p>

<p>You all seem to see nothing wrong with going from: &quot;we can&#39;t reach certain proof of what caused the towers to collapse,&quot; to: &quot;it was an inside job.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If one were to look at only the physical evidence at the scenes that may be a reasonable statement. But you are failing to consider all of the other evidence leading up to, during and after the event. Follow the money trail, check out Able Danger. How about the multiple military exercises occurring on that very day, some of which were simulating exactly what went down? What about Norman Mineta&#39;s testimony to the 911 Commission? Operation Northwoods demonstrated that the Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon were completely capable of planning and carrying out an operation of that type. And PNAC&#39;s &quot;another Pearl Harbor&quot; plan? What about the $2.3 trillion that disappeared from the Pentagon budget under the watch of Dov Zakheim and admitted to by Rumsfeld on TV the evening of 9/10? How about the fact that the accountants responsible for tracking that money were killed in the Pentagon attack the next morning. I could go on and on but simply don&#39;t have the time. There is so much more to it than just the physical evidence.</p>

<p>Follow the money, America funded 9/11, that&#39;s a fact, which is why the 9/11 commission report oddly doesn&#39;t go into the funding. The question is if this was just our regular aid payments re-purposed for evil or if there was a guiding hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC7 experienced free fall speeds for up to 100 feet(NIST). Most other stuff in conjecture, educated opinions and disinformation.  Most so called &quot;truthers&quot; want a new investigation based off dust sampling and the impossible physics of 7&#39;s collapse without resistance for a short time...(which is impossible without an outside influence ejecting material away from the floors below the collapsing material.  As the floors would then not collide with the falling debris/floors above, which would have caused deceleration.)  I&#39;ve been at this for 7 years and i still have no idea who to blame, but the WTC7 physics anomaly needs to be explained and has yet to be.</p>
