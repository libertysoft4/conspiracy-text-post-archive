        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Mayans based their number system in base 20 whenever possible. Because of their acute understanding of the cosmos (not a scratch on modern day, but pretty darn good for people without telescopes) they believed a year was 365 days (we&#39;ll come back to that later.)</p>

<p>Back to counting in twenties, A kin was a day, and twenty kin was a Uinal (like a month) and eighteen. Uinals make MOST of a Mayan year, a Tun. They can&#39;t go to 400, or they&#39;d be grossly inaccurate, so this is where they have to cheat the base twenty system. Obviously to make up 365 (remember this?) they now have to add five monthless days. As if the Mayans weren&#39;t already uncomfortable with cheating to eighteen, they now five days to escape the year. They were so uneasy with this leftover, they became known as dark days, where they would play music and drums and chase/ward away evil spirits.</p>

<p>Now, twenty Tuns (almost a year) is a Ka&#39;tun (19.7 years) and twenty of those is a BAK&#39;TUN. (We&#39;ll come back to this.)</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m sure most of you are old enough to remember that when we left the ninties behind, we moved into a new millenium. An entirely new set of numbers, that fit into our base ten system, a nice round thousand. We celebrate the end of every year quite significantly, and I imagine, the same will be true on a larger scale for new centuries, but a Millennia takes such a long time to get to, so you should consider yourself a lucky fellow to have lived in one of these, as the next one is in slightly short of one thousand years.</p>

<p>Coming back to our Mayan system again, you&#39;ll recall that I told you twenty Ka&#39;tuns make a Bak&#39;tun. A Bak&#39;tun is 394.3 years, which is by no means a small feat. twenty Bak&#39;tuns would be 7,885 years, which is longer than almost all of our significant recorded history. We might not even be living on this planet by the time we hit one of those.</p>

<p>December the 21st 2012, is the modern set date for the start of the next Bak&#39;tun. That&#39;s it, sadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the elongated heads can be explained by the fact that upper class mayans used to artificially elongate the heads of their children when their skulls were still squishy. This actually had a positive neurological effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has an adequate explanation for those things. Our society and culture are so far removed from what the Mayans considered reality that it&#39;s nearly impossible to understand what all their symbols and myths really meant. They may as well have existed on another world. That being said, you can always find the signs you started looking for if you look hard enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll do my best to answer some of these as cold reading (no research, just of the top of my head)</p>

<p>The date set, as I understand it is basically, at some point Mayan researchers said &quot;We like this calendar, but since the Mayans were taken over more than a good three hundred years ago, we need to set an exact date for when these Bak&#39;tuns and so on switch over&quot; so they chose  some time around that date. The high number of twelves was probably just a bit of fun with numbers, for example, I celebrate dates like 01/01/01 02/02/02 because they&#39;re pretty and I won&#39;t see them again in my lifetime.
New ageists are really big on date significance, so I imagine that they either decided lots of twelves were important, and it seemed like a good time to decide that the world would be ending (again).</p>

<p>There&#39;s no amazing second precision about Mayans. They decided the year was 365 days with no room for leap years, hence the 19.7 years thing.</p>

<p>Saucer shaped artwork? I assume you&#39;re referring to Mayan artefacts. They liked circles sometimes. I don&#39;t see why this has any relevance to UFOs at all. If anything, UFOs are an entirely different conspiracy, and by arguing cases and points for them, we are distracting from the originals point (much is the way with conspiracy theorists)</p>

<p>Elongated head, now I recall seeing a program about a tribe in africa that would wrap babies heads in tight linen, which coupled with the soft nature of baby&#39;s skull and that fact that the head would be growing, meant that they ended up with very long skulls. It&#39;s quite easy to manipulate a body&#39;s shape, hence why bras exist.</p>

<p>A lot of these specific &quot;this looks like a rocket&quot; I would imagine stems from the fact that people have seen rockets before seeing whatever it is that looks like a rocket from the past, and decide that it must be copying it. Humans are generally programmed to see shapes in things that don&#39;t exist, mainly this is connected to whatever it is in your brain that helps you recognise faces. (and see things in the clouds).
Again, it&#39;s very easy to convince the human mind it&#39;s seeing something other than it is, such as an optical illusion.</p>

<p>Most of the Mayan&#39;s understanding of the cosmos really just comes from existing as a civilisation for a long time, and having a fascination of the stars. If you lived for, say 400 years and you looked at the sky every day, I&#39;m sure you would notice differences.
But again, Mayan readings are not entirely accurate, for example, the names of their Uinal (like months) were originally named for the seasons they were in, but because of inaccurate years they eventually shifted and ended up in different seasons.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really bad at putting these in order,
but the start date of their calendar I would assume would be one of these things decided at a later date (like how Catholics believe the world started at 4000 bc, despite the fact Monotheism was probably not even around then.)</p>

<p>Hope this helps slightly</p>
