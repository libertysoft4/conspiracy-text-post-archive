<p>For the human race to make it to the next level of exploration, to colonize new planets, doesn&#39;t humanity have to come together under the collective idea of a one world society?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Plus these guys will not be nice anymore. As things stand now they have to pander to the people and present the illusion that we aren&#39;t already in a one world government. It&#39;s actually a three government world. Kind of. Thats the actual definition of the first second and third world. The goal of the new world order is to capture more of the the third world than Russia and china. They are the second world governments. This is the essance of world war 3. It&#39;s going on right now in front of our faces but we cannot see the bigger picture. In the end, god knows what will happen. I hope humanity wakes up before this takes place, because it will if people think a one world government would be a good idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A one world government is not inevitable. It is not even possible. The attempt to impose it will cause untold suffering across the world. The best government is local government, because it is more responsive to the wishes of the people it governs. The larger the government, the less responsive it becomes. For good government, we need smaller government, not larger government. More power to individual nations, and to states within those nations, and to cities within those states. Less power to national and international governing bodies. That&#39;s the answer.</p>

It&#39;s not the world government idea that is bad, it&#39;s THIS world government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve wondered this as well, if inevitably we do go to a one government world wouldn&#39;t that help poor nations out of the poverty level where they can work for globally fair wages. For instance, one central bank, one currency, and a world wide minimum wage. Currently poor countries will become the manufactures while the others stick to customizations of products/development and service based industries. No country can suffer hyper inflation (like African countries) and trade will essentially eliminate borders/pay differentials. I&#39;m down for this one world government as long as we progress as a society: away from fossil fuels, try to reduce our increasing population, stop wars, and start to really endeavor into space and science (medicine, efficient tech, safe agriculture). But nigga please that ain&#39;t going to happen. Those snakes want profits!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys aren&#39;t thinking far enough ahead.  This &quot;one world government&quot; will come at a time when being human doesn&#39;t mean what it does today.</p>

<p>The machines will get smarter and smarter, and as they start to build their replacements, we&#39;ll integrate with them.  Suddenly, all at once, our understanding of each other will change.  We&#39;ll be able to see the memories of others, and learn from their mistakes; feel the emotions of others, and experience <em>true</em> empathy.  What would we possibly have to fight over then, when we&#39;ve conquered aging, disease, and even hatred?  </p>

<p>When this happens, there will be a One-World government, because we&#39;ll be able to govern ourselves.  This is the vision of a Technological Singularity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many reasons. One is that there is no universal uni-culture, different groups have sometimes widely different beliefs, so having one government means inevitably some group will get stomped on. Nations exist to be different. Would you want to be forced to only have forced arranged marriages? Should the world be ruled by a religious state? Should the concerns of a warm tropical nation be overruled by the needs of Norway? Suppose the world government decides you cannot have more than one child? </p>

<p>A second big reason is, how would you like to be ruled by someone 3000 miles away across an ocean and you have no way to make yourself heard, because they have 6,840,507,002 other people all clamoring for them to share your tax payments with them. So the one world government decrees you will pay 40% of your income to them, and you have no way to resist or protest.</p>

<p>A problem with OOG is sheer size, scope, and scale. The world is too big to be run by one group. Also, having one government concentrates far too much power in its leaders&#39; hands. There would be no one to oppose them if they are wrong somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Universal Culture:</strong> Just like how in the United States the cultures of them cowboy boot wearin&#39;, red meat eatin&#39;, oil lovin&#39; Texans can&#39;t seem to exist in the same country as those hemp wearing, vegan eating, marijuana smoking hippies Portlandians?</p>

<p><strong>Climate Zones:</strong> Minnesotans are always complaining about how Hawaiians seem to make the rules, aren&#39;t they?</p>

<p><strong>Distance:</strong> With the Internet and other technological achievements, I can more easily and quickly talk to someone on the other side of the planet than the original founders of the United States of America could even talk to someone a mile away.  Never mind the fact that the United States (as the 3rd largest country in the world) spans a greater distance than those puny 3,000 miles from King George that inspired a revolution. From sea to shining sea indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Moral Relativity Problem:</strong> Now the crux of the problem... Arranged marriages, birth control, religious rights... Do you believe that there are ultimate truths in this life?  MURDERING another person is morally wrong?  Intentionally hurting someone?  We are continually striving to achieve these goals, and yes there will always be conflicts as in the UNITED States of America, and yet as a singular force, one country (as a model for One World Government) does exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in some ways we already have a OWG, because there is a code of conduct for trade - WTO treaty - and a formal declaration of human rights by the UN. Problems: the WTO treaty clearly is a scam for siphoning wealth off of we, the people; human rights are joke in most parts of the world, because the popular vote is that women are farm animals, infidels should be fought with fire and sword and sinners like rock&#39;n rollers, booze hounds and homosexuals shall be stoned to death. What would work much better is international solidarity of workers, formal agreements on conditions of boycot of ecological or humanitarian offenders, war criminals and the like. What&#39;s more, it could be argued that the US effectively is a OWG, because it imposes its will and beliefs on the rest of the world, what includes the ever so civilized, enlightened and independent countries of the EU. (Data retention, anyone? Laissez faire corporatism? SOPA, ACTA, Monsanto, software patents, war on some drugs?) Judging from that shit I&#39;m pretty sick of at this point, OWG is satan and must be fought tooth and nail, <em>Star Trek</em> notwithstanding. And don&#39;t get me started on the World Health Organization and its hypocritical stance on recreational drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually on the surface it seems like a good idea, the devil though is in the details.</p>

<p><strong>Borders Save Lives:</strong> When there is a war, revolution, etc... at least you might be able to make it over the border and survive. Imagine the Khmer Rouge or Rwanda with nowhere to go, nowhere to hide...</p>

<p><strong>Immigrants:</strong> No I am not going to get into whether it is good or bad, simply that people have options when times get bad. Einstein left Nazi Germany for the West - probably a damn good thing. People can at least look for a better place with their boots.</p>

<p><strong>Which Government?</strong> One could argue that an open, good and just government would be great for the world... Swedish or say Canadian systems might make for a lot of peace. But what about Saudi? Would you like to live under that system?</p>

<p><strong>Mass Migrations:</strong> If there was suddenly no borders, where do you think all the people would go? Europe, America and other industrial countries would be literally swamped with refugees and immigrants, most likely turning them into hell-holes of unimaginable misery. Imagine London with 40 million more people - overnight. Other places would be de-populated and barren. </p>

<p><strong>Politics:</strong> Now how do you get elected. I think I read somewhere it takes a billion dollars for the US president to get elected... imagine the money you would need for a world president. It would only be the elite of the elite wealthy that could do it, and that might not be so good.</p>

<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Intermixed with just about all human societies is the matter of religion. Say in the future that 51% of the human population becomes right-wing, nutter Muslim or Baptist and they would then be able outlaw all other religions leading to mass persecution of masses of humanity.</p>

<p><strong>Who Decides What?</strong> Lets take the US here. Lobbyists get laws passed for their small groups - giving small groups (that have money) immense powers, amplify that worldwide and you have poverty and chaos that would make the ninth-ring of hell look like a vacation.</p>

<p><strong>Freedom?</strong> It seems that every year the governments of each country make more and more laws, more conditions, more interference in every-day lives. Now lets amplify that by a thousand fold for a world government and see how fast you live in hell. Imagine all the petty laws of the world now apply to you.</p>

<p><strong>Power Grabs:</strong> If you are one of those people who want power, and are <em>slightly</em> sociopathic (like Stalin, Hitler, Pol-Pot etc...) you now have the whole world to inflict your version of whats right on. As a victim you have nowhere to hide, nowhere to go.</p>

<p><strong>Minorities:</strong> History is filled with minorities being victimized and eradicated through hatred and misunderstandings. In a world-wide system this would be accelerated. it could mean that every Irishman or German, or Buddhist could be targeted worldwide. </p>

<p>Well, actually there a lot more, but it gives you an idea as to why we are not at this level yet. Maybe someday.. not now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Men can never escape being governed. Either they must govern themselves or they must submit to being governed by others. If from lawlessness or fickleness, from folly or self-indulgence, they refuse to govern themselves, then most assuredly in the end they will have to be governed from the outside. They can prevent the need of government from without only by showing that they possess the power of government from within.&quot;</p>

<p>How do YOU show that you posses the power of government from within?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one world government is frowned upon, because it is usually associated with the Illuminati and their plan for the new world order.  I personally believe that in order for man to get off this rock and into space we will have to form a global government and start thinking in terms of what planet we are from and what species we all are and not what country we are from and what race we are.  This does not mean that I agree with what the Illuminati are reported to be planning if they create a one world government, i just think we have to start thinking about life on a stellar level instead of on a terrestrial level.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a Christian stand point I love the idea of a one-world government - because that&#39;s post-rapture. But besides that I think the idea is a good one, get our people as a planet on the same page and start solving some real problems with division of wealth, power, food, essentials that every human being should have available to them. The problem with that is that just like many governments wish to control their people, a global government means that the whole world is subject to one main source of people controlling all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an idea is great and it looks as if it will eventually in the distant future be the reality. Now how it actually comes to be is the scary part. Our civilization&#39;s current condition can&#39;t handle this our efforts and mentalities are too scatered. Worst of all the world govenrment must be resisted at all cost until you can feel safe that it won&#39;t be corrupted. </p>

<p>One world government will be real and good when it is something new and very unlike the governments of today. What the point of having a one world govt if it is only going to act like the tax collector that todays governments are. The world will be much different when a world government becomes real whether its chaos or paradise who knows. World government is bound to be a reality as long as this whole civilization things doesn&#39;t end badly.</p>

If the federal government took over all governance from all states you bet there would be issues and problems.</p>
