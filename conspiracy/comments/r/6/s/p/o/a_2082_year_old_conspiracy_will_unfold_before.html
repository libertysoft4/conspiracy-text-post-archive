<p>Please don&#39;t downvote this because you aren&#39;t interested in religious history, there are many people here who are. I would like them to have a chance to see this so they can participate tomorrow.</p>

<p>The major religions of the world are confused because of this event Patrick will be detailing tomorrow,  History as we know it has been lead down a path of war and constant strife in an attempt to cover-up the truth of what happened.</p>

<p>When you hear what Patrick has uncovered in his 40 years of dedicated study, the evidence will speak for itself.</p>

<p>Tomorrow at Noon!  Eastern Time in <a href="/r/iama">/r/iama</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> interesting twist developed here, <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a> has petitioned the mods of <a href="/r/iama">/r/iama</a> to &quot;not allow Conway to post tomorrow.&quot;  They were rejected when an iama-mod made a post telling them to question his credentials in the iama post and he would not be censored.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> sorry removed link to <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a> comment where they were trying to have the iama stopped,  crossposting is against the rules at <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a> so I comply. Sorry bout that.</p>

<p>Hi everyone. First post here, but I wanted to clear something up. I&#39;m a scholar of the New Testament, versed in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. I have two degrees in New Testament from Princeton. I am a regular contributor to r/Christianity. </p>

<p>What I and other scholars on r/Christianity were petitioning for was that someone with no degrees, no tenure, and no teaching experience in the field of religion, whose only religious-studies publication was through a press he owns and funds (basically, a vanity publication), not be referred to as a &quot;scholar&quot; in the AMA title. That&#39;s it. Period. None of us asked that his AMA be suppressed, or silenced in any way, just that he not be allowed to flagrantly misrepresent himself and his expertise. We are not seeking to censor, only to clarify the title to more accurately reflect the reality of his credentials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post hi-lights the importance of clarifying the title, at least in our minds. In a community already predisposed against religion (Reddit), this AMA might serve to confuse people about a number of important points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An academic, &quot;scientific&quot; study of religions, apart from practice of and devotion to those religions, exists in universities around the world. The perceived silliness of the subject matter does as much to tarnish the rigor and reality of those disciplines as the silliness of a lunatic&#39;s delusions does to tarnish the reality and rigor of clinical psychology.</p></li>
<li><p>There are atheist scholars of religion, as well as scholars of religion that do not practice or affirm the religion they study. As such, they have no vested interest in its truth or success.</p></li>
<li><p>Criteria exist for the study of religion, history of religion, and religious texts which are very much like the heuristics employed in sociology, secular history (if there is such a thing), and study of non-religious classics and literature. It is not handled with kid gloves in the academy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In a community that already feels that any study of religion is crack-pot and a waste of time, I think it would be detrimental to the general knowledge and perception of Redditors to get an experience of a religious &quot;scholar&quot; who confirms their worst fears, and leaves them confused about what the academic study of religion really means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theist here. I wouldn&#39;t exactly say that it would confuse people and therefore we cant allow it, but isnt this the mentality of most christians? The blind faith mentality that just because someone says something about Christ and the way things are the they should automatically believe it. Now ive read a few books on the legitimacy of the biblical texts and teachings and challenged my faith, which some Christians see as heresy. I challenged it to the point that ive renounced my faith in an organized religion where open minded discussions and personal perspectives on God and his teachings is frowned upon and quickly silenced.</p>

<p>If people wish to believe blindly thats their fault for not questioning what thay are told to believe. I was taught from a very young age to always ask &quot;why&quot;, and when someone tells me to do something because God says so I ask why and 7 times out of 10 its turns into a circle jerk of &quot;the bible says you should&quot; and &quot;God wrote the bible so its right. And don&#39;t think im saying all Christians because i know that doing so would be a fallacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hence why TurretOpera is asking for <em>clarity</em> of label, not censorship of material.  In short, I believe TurretOpera is stating that Patrick J. Conway does not in any way form what-so-ever represent the entirety of Christian doctrine/beliefs and the label should reflect this.</p>

<p>Never forget, a real Christian would not be blind in his or her faith: to do so would be out of fear and ignorance.  Our individual beliefs must be tempered in the fires of doubt and skepticism, with love and respect.  It must be able to wither the questions - otherwise how can it be the truth?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Close, but it&#39;s not Christianity I&#39;m concerned about (since Conway isn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think, specifically Christian). Rather, I&#39;m conserned about what his calling himself a &quot;religious scholar&quot; might do to Reddit&#39;s already dim view of religious scholars, who are actually real academics with logical, peer-reviewed methodologies. Christianity only enters into it insomuch that having a needlessly dismal view of religious scholarship makes interacting with Christianity on the credible, logical basis, accepted by the accademy, even more of a hopeless prospect for most Redditors. The same could be said of its impact on the other religions Conway considers too, its just that, Reddit being a mostly <em>Occidental</em> phenomenon, most of the atheist Redditors are post-Christian, not post-Mayan or post-Muslim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, this is what I was talking about-most people assume a 1-1 correlation between being a scholar who studies a certain religion and having rabid devotion to that religion. This simply isn&#39;t the case. Is an oncologist necessarily a cancer victim or survivor, or a friend or relative of someone who is? I assume some may have become interested in that field for that reason, but the thing in no way follows logically. Also, while actually devoted Christian scholars have their biases, when they&#39;re publishing for the academy, they&#39;re required to conform to rigorous, secular rules too, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dating based on the assumption that prophesy is impossible. If Jesus mentions the destruction of the temple in a book, it was written after the destruction of the temple. Jesus is not using his godhood to foretell the future. The commentary will not attempt to prove Jesus&#39; godhood in any way.</p></li>
<li><p>No belief in the supernatural. You talk about other similar miracle stories in ancient culture, or about the source of this particular miracle story. You don&#39;t talk about  how Jesus must have gotten his power from God, or how blessed Paul was.</p></li>
<li><p>No tradition-as fact. Traditions are clearly labeled as traditions. We don&#39;t know who wrote Luke. We don&#39;t know how Thomas died.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In short, shocking though this may be, a secular historian writing about Jesus could cite a scholarly (i.e., works in Greek and Hebrew), non-devotional biblical commentary written by a Christian, like James Dunn, in a paper written for a secular historical society, and nobody would bat an eyelash, because the commentary treats the Greek text, treats the history, treats the tradition, and treats it all using the same objective, scholarly standards any historian or literary scholar uses to dissect any piece of history or literature that they do not have a religious devotion to, or as close as someone can reasonably be expected to get (bias always can, I guess, be detected at some level, somehow).</p>

<p>Wow, this has turned into my own AMA, and I didn&#39;t want to, or mean to threadjack or bring this OT subject into this sub. I just wanted to make it known that OP, at least at the time of the first post, was not accurately representing the concerns of myself and the others from r/Christianity who were puzzling over this AMA title. We were concerned, because it poses the risk that everything I just posted might be obscured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to have a few giggles by the time I&#39;m done, but really &quot;Empirical testing of spiritual stuff?&quot; As an occultist, I find this statement incredibly baffling. Of course, those who practice workings typically record what works and what doesn&#39;t in an empirical sense, but what you are asking is absurd. The spiritual cannot be measured, it is infinite and words, theorems, or what have you will never be able to encapsulate it. In other words, it&#39;s an experiential phenomenon that can&#39;t be explained by science, and thus is so quickly and easily dismissed by many who will never care to experience it for themselves.</p>

<p>But think about the world we would live in if more people DID care to experience it themselves. Even in a completely atheist sense, (as in you don&#39;t subscribe to a theology) you can feel that incredible state if you just approach it with an open mind and stow your doubts for a moment. Science and spirituality (read: <em>not</em> religion*) BELONG with one another! It is the whole perspective. Science is casual understanding, spirituality is the oceans-deep knowing. And besides, don&#39;t we owe it to this miraculous Earth, our host organism, to treat our environment with sanctity and respect? To see it as it is -- truly divine? Science paints the world in such a materialistic, detached, colorless way. It&#39;s pretty sad stuff, man!</p>

<p>This is the problem I&#39;ve had with science since I was in like 3rd grade. I agree it has its place, and it&#39;s very useful, but it by no means grasps everything there is to know, and no empirical study ever will. I am not myself a practitioner of occult or mystic stuff, but I am well aware (based on experiences with LSD) that there is more out there than we trick ourselves into believing every day.</p>

When I say that it is not science, I mean because it is ridiculous to try and force the strict definitions that science requires on somthing as personal as spiritual health.

<p>No I personally belive its more of how different ppeople think. Religion as a whole seems to be filled with people who focus on why we are different. Usually by saying how man is better, or worse, than some idea. Were as science seems to look more deeply at how we are the same. How everything works togeather, in a very broad, yet exact, way.</p>

<p>Religious people that I have talked to fail to see the wonder in the way I see the interconnection of everything, from the largest systems to the smallest. Science is truly the most hopeful way of interpreting the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me reiterate by stating that I am not in favor of organized religions, as they seem very clearly to be geared towards controlling the populace.</p>

<p>The problem is that science is not exact, and it can never hope to be. There is chaos amongst everything. Science can help us to understand, but it leaves a gaping void in how we interact with the subtlety of all things. </p>

<p>And I further disagree with your point on how science looks deeply at how we are all the same. Sure, a lot has been established to debunk the theories revolving around race, but there is a <em>very</em> dangerous idea lurking out there surrounding genetics. You hear it all the time, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s in my genes, there&#39;s nothing I can do about it,&quot; and other such phrases of resignation. I am not a fan of slippery slopes, but ideas such as these are a fast track to some really horrible outcomes. I do not see science as a philosophy of unity. It is cold, calculating and intolerant. Plenty of comments that float around on this website are a testament to that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just not true. After the initial spread ot Christianity(aka the fall ofhe Roman empire and the start of the holy Roman empire) the bible was written in Latin. Almost no one in empire, other than the wealthy (aka the church and royalty) no one could read or talk in Latin. It wasn&#39;t until Martin Luther(not king Jr) came around and translated the bible to the comon tounge that anyone could even attempt to read the bible. It was required to be read out loud in Latin as well.</p>

<p>What the preacher then did was tell people what he had read, and what that meant. Even to the point where the church was selling the forgivness of sins, for both the living and the dead, when the bible explicitly states it is free.</p>

<p>However, I didn&#39;t have the time to go over a complete history of the middle ages with you.</p>

<p>The not reading part is true, however they would not have been able to read it even if they could read and write in their own laungage. People were not allowed to translate &quot;the word of god&quot; by law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is hard to get pure sensory data even from science in this day and age unless you are the one with your hands in the dirt.Most scientific knowledge that we &quot;think&quot; we know is actually knowledge based on faith(yes i said it) in the scientist and his conclusions. This doesn&#39;t mean that you aren&#39;t coming to your own conclusions. It simply means that your knowledge isn&#39;t pure sensory data because most likely it came to you from text on the computer or even a video which is a secondary source that can only be believed or hoped for without actually physically touching- seeing- smelling. Not to mention that much of science today is based on beings of reason causing the &quot;true knowledge&quot; to be even further from your senses. The fact is science is the study of nature and there are many ways to perceive and view objective reality. Anyone who experiences objective reality no matter how they choose to perceive it is a scientist..</p>

<p>Maybe. But if science can&#39;t obtain &quot;complete understanding&quot; of a thing, how can it ever be known by non-scientific means?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny that there may be some things science never gets, and maybe even that there are some things science never <em>can</em> get.

<p>Exactly.  Your problem, and one of the bigger problems with modern science, is since you cannot <em>currently</em> quantify them, they do not exist.  It is entirely possible that angels exist as some form of collected electromagnetic energy, and we simply haven&#39;t found the way to detect, interact, or quantify them yet.</p>

<p>The way you interpret what you, yourself, said (whether you like it or not) implies that atoms didn&#39;t exist until we could manipulate them.  X-rays were not a part of the electromagnetic spectrum until we detected them.  Et cetra.  You do realize that humanity currently has no way to quantify gravity.  We cannot manipulate it, and we&#39;ve never detected a graviton.  Other then measuring the externally applied force in observed objects, we literally have no idea what gravity is.  That does not stop it from being a truth of reality.</p>

<p>The default position, without evidence, is to hold no belief on the matter. Until we detect these EM-angels (or the millions of other things that <em>could</em> hide in that same little pocket of scientific ignorance,) there&#39;s no basis for asserting that we know anything about them. More directly, if science can&#39;t know that those angels exist, <em>how does man</em>?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I never said things don&#39;t exist until we can detect them scientifically. I spoke against the existence of things which (somehow) can never be detected by science. However, if there does exist an object which can <em>not</em> be detected <em>ever</em>, by <em>any</em> form of science we might develop, then I would postulate that this object has so little quantifiable effect on the universe that it is almost certainly not very important.</p>

<p>But I would never stop looking.</p>

Its like saying science is one way of discovering the way the universe works i.e collecting evidence based upon observable facts, but the other way is.....what exactly??
Reading a book and taking it for granted? Looking at the clouds and assuming they are cotton wool becuase they look like it? 
For instance it is possible Angels exist but have not yet been doscovered by the scientific method but i do not see any other way that they can be discovered, it seems some people think to just say yes they exist because I know someone who has seen one or I have this feeling, or a read it in the bible is enough.

Even more laughably so, the arguable founder of modern science, Rene Decartes, received the words which have resounded and echoed through the centuries, &quot;The conquest of nature is achieved through measure and number,&quot; from an <em>ANGEL</em> in a dream that he had. YES. <strong>A fucking angel.</strong> I wonder what Carl Sagan would have had to say about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People see and hear angels all the time. Usually giving them Lithium and a phenothiazine in measured doses solves this problem (schizophrenia). A solid basis in psychobiology would have told you that 50 years ago. The subconscious is still being actively studied, but we have yet to see evidence of dreams imparting any kind of knowledge the individual didn&#39;t already have. </p>

<p>In Descartes&#39; case, the angel anecdote may have even been put down on paper to convince a powerful church that he was doing work for them, rather than against them. You have accepted, unquestioningly, both that Descartes believed his own anecdote, and that the dream actually happened the way it is told. Descartes was also quite fond of trying to use words alone to will God into existence. His ontological argument has been torn apart time and time again, and yet people still think that <em>a priori</em> knowledge, especially of some deity, exists.</p>

<p>On your other point, certainly occult practices such as alchemy were considered sciences at one point, but the beauty of science is its ability to change its outcomes to match the observations, instead of the other way around. This isn&#39;t the black mark on the history of science that you seem to think it is, rather it is the celebration of overcoming our own superstitions, and a cautionary tale regarding <em>wanting</em> something to work. Newton&#39;s theory of gravity holds true because there has <em>never been an experiment that proved it false</em>.</p>

<p>You have yet to actually provide an example of how knowledge can be obtained through some other method than science. When you say the map is not the territory, you are correct. The map describes the territory, often in ways that our individual senses cannot. The scientific method has allowed advances in every single field of knowledge, with the possible exception of philosophy (which is primarily word games these days anyway).</p>

<p>I expect you to bring up something like insight, or intuition. Both of these would actually be subject to the scientific method; insight, when you make a connection between two disparate things, causes you to react in accordance with your understanding, which then provokes a reaction that either confirms or denies your insight; intuition, when your brain recognizes an advanced pattern without being able to pinpoint the source of the recognition, just means that you can&#39;t name or pinpoint the source, not that there isn&#39;t one - at any rate you move forward with actions assuming your intuition is correct, and are either confirmed in your hypothesis on the pattern, or denied.</p>

<p>In both of the above cases there is a well studied tendency to remember the times your insight and intuition were right, and trivialize, forget, or otherwise discount the times when it wasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>**Edit: clarity and spelling. Also, an excellent groundwork in logic, philosophy, and science, with a healthy dose of curiousity, can work wonders on the human mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solid, well-thought out post. Thanks for that.</p>

<p>I really have no desire to further discuss Descartes&#39; experience, as I have had a round with plenty of others and it has left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth, but I would like to approach some of the other topics you&#39;ve mentioned.</p>

<p>Alchemy is a very misunderstood occult study to most. In truth, it was a means of concealing the act of working toward spiritual impeccability. The soul (characterized by the alembic) would undergo various processes to purify it, and the end result was the metaphor of turning lead into gold. Perhaps this explanation was unwarranted, but I thought you may find it interesting. Insofar as the occult&#39;s contribution to science, John Dee is probably one of the more influential individuals within this subject -- there&#39;s a wealth of information on him out there if you care to explore it.</p>

<p>Intuition is a very interesting subject, and there was a fantastic book written on it titled &quot;Limitless Mind&quot; which admittedly takes a scientific approach. I certainly applaud it, as it is an effort in entwining something many would call &quot;woo woo&quot; with hard science. But beyond that, there is an incredible amount of experiential phenomena that people undergo that is very difficult to explain, such as out-of-body experiences, the effects Qi Gong masters have on their own bodies, and even the psychedelic experience is a tricky subject to pin down. Will science be able to explain these things in time? Probably, but it seems likely from where I am standing now that it will take a big shift in how we perceive reality for these things to be able to be explained. </p>

<p>I am not against science, nor am I for superstition. But I definitely feel as humans playing around in our short lives, a playful attitude towards the mystery that confronts us is important. I&#39;m just saying, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all cut-and-dry as many would like it to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a book called <em>The Eight</em>, by Katherine Neville, which was an interesting fictional pursuit into a lot of the perceived forces of alchemy, including the alchemical numerology and chess references. It was a fun read, and it definitely made me think differently about the subject. Newton also studied alchemy extensively, and tried to treat it as a science, but really didn&#39;t get any results.</p>

<p>I think the problems we have had in the past (and to a degree, currently) with trying to pin down how to quantify human experience is that we are, collectively and as a species, pretty arrogant. We assume our own superiority and special-ness as compared with other parts of nature. It&#39;s the same argument about whether or not we&#39;ll truly create AI, or if we&#39;ll even create real intelligence; people just aren&#39;t sure it can be done. There&#39;s been some interesting things done with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a> in the last few years. The wikipedia article doesn&#39;t do the recent research justice, but it gets the generally idea across. Recently they&#39;ve gotten a <a href="http://wireframe.iyogi.com/geekosphere/ai-that-can-estimate-number-of-objects-without-counting.html">neural network to be able to estimate the number of objects in front of it</a> in Italy. Ignoring the sensationalist writing of the article, it&#39;s a step towards understanding how our own brain processes images and comes to generalized conclusions.</p>

<p>**edit: A great line that I read somewhere but can&#39;t remember the source for right now is &quot;The mind is what the brain does&quot; which I agree with. The mind is the emergent property of an extremely complicated and chaotic neural network of infinitely interconnected cells that can even create new connections as needed.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This really stuck out to me as something I contest and agree with at the same time. Or perhaps I should say I agree, with conditions. The mystery of the universe, and even of our own minds and human experience, can be a wonderful and interesting thing, but I agree with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ulkX-DA9BM">Neil deGrasse Tyson&#39;s opinion</a> that when you stop asking questions because you&#39;re content with the mystery, you&#39;re not advancing science but holding it back. </p>

<p>That being said, there&#39;s an attitude from a lot of scientists that there&#39;s nothing to be learned from any source but a peer-reviewed one, which I also disagree with. You have to have some flexibility in your understanding of the world (except at the most extreme top of a scientific field where specialization is necessary). We don&#39;t understand our own minds because we&#39;re not very introspective as a Western society. I did martial arts for 10 years, and with the physical training came mental training too - meditation is something that is still important to my life, and I understand that there can be epiphanies that don&#39;t seem to stem from any outside source. I&#39;m willing to accept that I can&#39;t pinpoint a source, but not that one doesn&#39;t exist. If we never figure it out I won&#39;t be surprised, but that&#39;s only because we&#39;re not particularly smart as a species.</p>

I don&#39;t honestly find it dangerous to hold to one method toward obtaining truth. What I do find dangerous is when you hold to one truth being the correct truth. science doesn&#39;t do that however superstition and religion do.  science is a method...superstition and religion are not methods. they are answers without the ability to be tested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a scientist but I&#39;m curious enough to devote a fair amount of time educating myself on a number of things. As for the things that I don&#39;t personally have a basic grasp of you can at least see their practical applications in the real world.  Quantum physics is a great example...the average schmuck has absolutely no grasp of it. Hell..even the scientists who study it only kindof get it. But looking at things like quantum entanglement and its application in quantum computers that are being developed now at least puts some light on the subject and the fact that they are at least on to something. </p>

<p>Being unbiased isn&#39;t a requirement to be a scientist either.  If anything a biased scientist may give a perspective of looking at something that others may not have and they may come up with new ideas.  From there any theories or ideas they come up with would get submitted for peer review by any number of scientists who may or (most likely) may not share the same bias.  </p>

<p>When it comes to religion or superstition or anything along those lines...if you try to dissect their views like they do in science then the people promoting those views tend to go on the defensive.  That&#39;s the key difference between the two mediums. The whole point of science is to dissect and rip apart another persons theory in order to prove it correct or incorrect - or even to prove your own theory correct when someone rebuttals it. The whole point of religion/superstition is to accept what you feel or are told without questioning it.  That and the practical applications associated with superstition/religion are questionable at best.</p>

<p>Superstition/religion did, however, do a great job of keeping humanity in the dark for a over thousand years.  While the ancient world was ripe with superstitious belief - the people of ancient greece, alexandria, ionia, etc formed the basis of modern science as we have it today. After the library of alexandria burned it&#39;s been said that set humanity back technologically by a thousand years.  If you don&#39;t believe it do some research on what they had for technology around that time - the amazing clockwork applications like the antikythera mechanism just to name one.  Once we were plunged into the dark ages, lead by religion and superstition, europe became stagnant for a millenium.  It wasn&#39;t till the renaissance, when science began to emerge in its modern form, and people realizing what religion and superstition had done over the last thousand years ending up with the inquisition that we began to pulled ourselves out of it.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t ultimately bash religious or superstitious belief on an individual level. People will believe what they will believe and I&#39;ve met many religious people are are really good people. However, those who had studied their history realize just how much damage it&#39;s done and how much it has held us back as a race as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not supporting either religion or superstition. Religion is a means of controlling the populace, history has proven that quite well and I agree with you on all counts regarding the damage it has, and is still inflicting on the world. I don&#39;t really have an opinion on superstition, but my point is not in support of it. What I am supporting is spirituality, personal phenomenology, or even occultism. By this, I mean approaching the unknown, <em>personally</em> and not giving a fuck what anyone else thinks. The truth is inside ourselves, it&#39;s not something external to be found. This is what is so sorely missing in our society, this is why capitalism has run rampant and is destroying our planet, this is why science is not being used to its fullest potential. We live in a society that epitomizes the ego and the material which keeps drawing us away from our true selves. Quiet your mind and think about it.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that science in and of itself is a bad thing that doesn&#39;t benefit humanity. What I <em>am</em> suggesting is that science tends to lean towards understanding the physical aspects of the world around us, and that a spiritual <em>knowing</em> is a missing component to understanding key underlying aspects of our world. Science with its foundation of understanding will never be able to crack those mysteries, because it is closed-minded to the possibility of such things, and it lacks the means to measure them. Think about it, if people spent as much time in meditation exploring their consciousness and dissolving their ego as they watch TV, we would live in a completely different society. If psychedelics were a rite of passage in the process of coming of age, I guarantee you, the world would be a friendlier, safer and more benevolent place. </p>

<p>A claim of being spoken to by a supernatural entity in a DREAMSCAPE, a realm of infinite possibility, <strong>IMPLIES NOTHING ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL ENTITY IN REALITY</strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>Before anything else please don&#39;t call me a fool. While waxing philosophically about human nature is cool and all when the time is available it does nothing to affect the world around you. There are many ways to describe the universe around us and that includes that which is inside us as well. We as human beings see the world through a small myopic lens. It&#39;s one organ in our bodies using other organs to receive electrical signal that it can interpret into what ever electro-chemical process is being engaged at the time. The use of adverbs, nouns, verbs to describe our world can be looked at as a short hand to allow more of these electrical signal to reach the brain in an increased fashion. </p>

<p>Science is not an absolute way because it is once again a short hand for interpreting the world around. Same with math and literature. Math is a big one thought and should have its own merit of importance. Beyond all others it has the ability to describe things in which we can not understand the complete picture but extrapolate that it&#39;s there anyways. 
That&#39;s a big deal. </p>

<p>This is all fun but until we can clone and create something sentient it&#39;s nothing new to talk about the mysteries of the universe and how some thing even science can not fully understand. Always from the people not doing the science of coarse. People like mystery. Science and math are the ultimate spoilers of the human condition. For some. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, you&#39;re not a fool as you said so yourself that science isn&#39;t absolute and has its own limits. So why is it that you disagree with me that it can&#39;t explain everything? It would seem you agree with me? Yes, it is the ultimate spoiler and I don&#39;t take any issue with that. I like knowing how stars are formed and die, I like knowing how things evolve, and I thoroughly enjoy all sorts of major advancements in my everyday life due to science. That being said, can it answer every question? No. I think not. I think there are some questions that can&#39;t be answered in the English language nor the language of mathematics. I also think there are some questions that can&#39;t be answered at all. For every logical system there are the axioms, the hidden assumptions of the universe from which everything is extrapolated (tell me if I&#39;m sounding too much like a rationalist). Does any of that detract from what science has done? No. But I think its important to be realistic about our expectations and the limits of the scientific method.</p>

Skepticism is healthy but to say that we can&#39;t know everything...from what perspective? From the cumulative perspective?

A lot of people seem to confuse the latter (our limited lives) and the former (the information outliving us in the cumulative and contributing more and more).

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical of everything that anyone has ever told me. I go with what resonates with me, personally, and leave the rest out. People put so much faith into science and yet they rarely know how it works -- and this is where I primarily agree with Carl Sagan. You put your trust into what you think is an authoritative source of information, but oftentimes you have to ask the question, who is funding these scientists? Do they truly lack bias? I&#39;m sure most do, but there are plenty out there that don&#39;t. Science creates a ton of problems, and then uses more science to fix them down the road when the problems become evident. It&#39;s the same old story, &quot;They know not what they do.&quot; Our heads are so far the fuck up our asses, it&#39;s laughable. Give me a simpler time without all this technocratic bullshit, pharmaceuticals that induce illness and food that was actually nourishing. I&#39;d take that and a healthy dose of woo woo any day over this post-industrial garbage we have now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The study of consciousness has made a lot of advancements of late. It is very hard for me to accept that science will <strong>never</strong> be able to explain it in detail. Many people have said similar things before about subjects that laypeople understand comprehensively today. Now, will we ever get to the point that we can capture consciousness and play it ala Strange Days? Perhaps when that level of technology is reached humanity will have an understanding of the effects of psychedelics that satisfies your question.</p>

<p>TL;dr It seems reasonable that at some point humanity&#39;s understanding of consciousness will answer that question to your satisfaction.</p>

<p>You&#39;re revealing a deep misunderstanding of what your brain actually is - a highly ordered and controlled series of chemical reactions. That&#39;s it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think science can only explain what the chemicals are doing to your brain, but how do you explain what you see and why you see it with science? </p>

<p>To explain the mechanism-of-action of drugs (interaction with serotonin receptors, cannabinoid receptors, what have you) IS to explain what you see and why you see it. If you&#39;re looking for a &#39;reason why you saw a totally cool eagle, man!&#39; on your last acid binge there is no &quot;reason&quot; other than the effect that the chemical had on the workings of your brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, the old &quot;I tripped harder than you so there must be something mystical about what happened&quot; argument.. It never fails to amuse me. And yes, son, I do have the fucking credentials, thanks for asking.</p>

<p>There is no &#39;argument&#39; that what you perceived was &quot;simply the result of the mechanism-of-action of drugs&quot; and the altered state of your brain that they induced. That is an immutable fact. Your subjective perceptions, drug-induced or otherwise, are <strong>inextricably</strong> linked to their root causes in the physical workings of your brain. </p>

<p>Your thought-experiment is poorly worded, not related to the discussion-at-hand, and continues to reveal your misunderstanding of how the mind works. What do you mean by &quot;[switching] yourself?&quot; To me, this would mean some sort of brain transplant, in which case the answer to the root question is exceedingly obvious. However, you go on to say &quot;what if the person you switched with had a (sic) inferior brain,&quot; which shows that you believe there is some &#39;self&#39; NOT linked to the brain. This is categorically untrue and nullifies the experimental question.</p>

How do you explain Deja-vu or the opposite(excuse me I forgot the word I believe it starts with a j maybe jamnevu??) or that sense you get when someone is looking at you, there are many things that science cannot prove yet. Unless you are some all knowing being you cannot say that there is no such thing as a &quot;self&quot; separate but linked to you&#39;re physical body in this stage in life.

I totally agree with what you said, there are so many possibilities, they have to be more intelligent than us for one, and would that make them want to meet you, come down and say hi to everyone and shake our hands haha. For two they could just be monitoring us playing a hand when necessary, but I&#39;m wondering if they would really want to have anything to do with us at all really. I see this way, pretend you are walking through the jungle and you spot a gorilla...do you walk up and ask for some help or do you just take some pictures and gtf away from the uncivilized beast? Who knows? Also if you havnt already, try the Ender&#39;s saga by Orson Scott Card.  </p>

<p>by your definition, that would make any alien that shows up on earth automatically  a &quot;god&quot;, which just isn&#39;t true....just as the &quot;gods&quot; who are purported to have ruled this planet ages ago, weren&#39;t really gods, we just thought they were b/c they had <em>better technology</em>. </p>

<p>the Aztecs thought Cortes was a god, just because he had metal armor and huge ass ships, and his skin was white-ish (like their god Quetzlcoatl--I probably spelled that wrong). Cortes wasn&#39;t a fucking god, he just had better technology than the Aztecs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I guess I was a little vague. I wasn&#39;t implying that they were actually &quot;gods&quot;. I meant it in the context of brownestrabbit&#39;s comment and moogle516&#39;s question, &quot;How did they get to be a god?&quot;</p>

<p>These non-human entities wouldn&#39;t actually be &quot;gods&quot;, but then that comes down to what the definition of &quot;god&quot; would be. Dictionary.com&#39;s <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/god">third definition</a> from the World English Dictionary defines &quot;god&quot; as &quot;Any person or thing to which excessive attention is given.&quot; Then following their example given, and assuming Patrick J.Conway is actually speaking to some non-human entitiy, this being that he is communicating with is very well a &quot;god&quot;.</p>

<p>Man, this is completely unrelated, but isn&#39;t thinking really so much fun? And I don&#39;t mean that sarcastically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That part kind of depends on the occurrence of sapient life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong (particularly since one of Drake&#39;s variables is unknown: how long a sapient species survives before destroying itself.) It&#39;s just that there&#39;s a pretty wide range of possibilities. Earth is the only life-bearing planet we know of thus far, so it may be that it&#39;s a supremely rare occurrence. Or it may be that life is common, but sapience is not (since evolution has no direction.) Or it could be that the universe is brimming with lifeforms.</p>

<p>Even in the case of the latter, I still think the distances between stars are so vast that--short of FTL travel or von Neumann probes--we&#39;re pretty damned unlikely to encounter extraplanetary lifeforms anytime in the near future.</p>

<p>But damn, it would be cool.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think these people understand that you don&#39;t need to give all this information to the masses. All you need to do is prove that extraterrestrial life exists period. It doesn&#39;t matter who they are, or where they are from, or what their motives for being here are. You just need to say they exist, and here&#39;s proof. Everything else you know can come after the fact that you prove there is anything there at all. Going into such great detail just makes me believe your story even less.

<p>Quotes like that last part frustrate the fuck out of me. It seems like it should go on one of those Keanu memes from  <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a>. People know that others are more likely to give them credibility when they agree with them, so they start tossing out bullshit blanket statements that most people would sorta agree with. Of course in a perfect world we would like to do less harm to the planet and each other. That doesnt mean we are aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 1800s, the French Academy of Sciences offered prize money to any scientist who could conclusively prove that life was either
spontaneous or random—and Louis Pasteur won the contest. When you see a carton of milk that says it is pasteurized, this means it was cooked
to kill all the bacteria—and this process was named after Louis Pasteur. The problem is that Pasteur’s competitors did get life-forms to grow out of
nonliving environments—such as by using preparations of hay that had been totally sterilized in water. Pasteur simply refused to repeat these
experiments. It’s even more disappointing that Pasteur found life that spontaneously appeared in a small percentage of his own experiments, but he
never even wrote about them—because he felt they had to be mistakes, and were not worth mentioning..</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> there&#39;s a cold war between academia, atheism and religion. He&#39;s against all three because academia is crap at solving worlds problems (technology is doing that role) atheists are ignorant - not evil and religion is a load of crap because we have never actually have been able to speak to God. </p>

<p>Collectively these have caused all the wars in the world because they can&#39;t agree on anything. </p>

<p>The bible is a history book and all the predictions in it  - Armageddon, end of the world, floods, famine etc were jewish/Israel centric only and have already happened 1000 years ago.  These were the so called &#39;ancients&#39; were the Egyptians, romans etc, who suddenly disappeared and this led to the so called &quot;dark ages&quot; because all the knowledge of the solar system, engineering, philosophy, and advanced technology etc all died with them.  </p>

<p>The ancient cultures were all satanic in nature because if satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms in the world if he would bow down before him then satan would have had to have owned it all.  </p>

<p>nothing will happen in 2012</p>

<p>he&#39;s pro bible but anti everything else (apart from technology) </p>

<p>It should be an interesting AMA - everyone will be berating him (with the exception of r/technology)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...so you&#39;re merely repeating what you have found in the dusty textbooks of academia?  </p>

<p>*When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.</p>

<p>*The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.  </p>

<p>*Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>

<p>*you won&#39;t find any of it in a textbook</p>

<p>Second,  and I can&#39;t stress this enough.   YOU are an idiot for promoting this, as well as saying you were going to solve a 2082 mystery and it ends up being about the fall of Jerusalem, which took place in 70 AD (CE), meaning NOT BC.  If I add 2082 to 70 (Quick now, 2082+70) you end up with the year 2152.  The last time I checked my TARDIS is still in the shop, and it&#39;s 2012 which would make the 70 AD event 1942 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s obvious that the current world economy only serves the most powerful nations and the controlling factors, business and government. It is only natural to trade resources if it is a mutually beneficial relation. As such, the peoples that are less advanced or have little to offer in trade will not earn as much power as the nations that are more advanced and has more to trade. One could consider cost-time factors of countries with unsuitable infrastructure for trade. There is also the case that a country possesses rich natural resources, but the native people are ill-equipped to trade it. Such problems leave only a few options:
1. Call it a day and try somewhere else.
2. Take over the civilization and its resources (AKA kill everyone and plunder).
3. Educate the native people, provide suitable infrastructure in return for their resources.</p>

<p>But what if people can be considered resources? The typical answer has been slavery of various nature. e.g. manual labor slaves, intellectual slaves, prostitution. All viable sources of revenue. However, it has also been the case that slavery, at some point, incites rebellious nature in people and societies. As a result the master(s) must impose either a more direct version of slavery, a more indirect one, or remove slavery. I cannot see any other cases beyond those three.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Slavery defined:</p>

<p>1.the condition of being subject to some influence or habit</p>

<p>2.the state or condition of being a slave; a civil relationship whereby one person has absolute power over another and controls his life</p>

<p>3.the subjection of a person to another person, esp in being forced into work</p>

<hr/>

<p>First case: Impose a more direct version of slavery. This can be realized through various punishments for uncooperative nature or complete control of function.</p>

<p>Second case: Impose a more indirect version of slavery. This can be realized through illusions, propaganda, misinformation, withholdment of information, unfair reward, hidden wealth, etc. Essentially convincing the slaves to work docilely and without a fair and reasonable proportion of the profit.</p>

<p>Third case: Remove slavery. </p>

<p>Without suitable technology or the consent of controlling forces, cases 1 and 2 are basically impossible to maintain forever. There is also a cost of maintaining control that inevitably turns up through implementation of systems and sometimes errors. However, this cost may be negligible on the long term.</p>

<p>Type 1 civilization must have power output capabilities from 10<sup>16--10<sup>17</sup></sup> Watts. Lemarchand, Guillermo A. Detectability of Extraterrestrial Technological Activities. <a href="http://www.coseti.org/lemarch1.htm">http://www.coseti.org/lemarch1.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Total world energy supply i.e. primary energy (2008) was 143,851 TWh and the end use of energy (2008) was 98,022 TWh. This is equivalent to 1.1174508e13 Watts in a year. <a href="http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf">http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf</a></p>

<p>As it may appear, the world (let alone a single civilization) has yet to become a Type 1 civilization. Given that a type 1 civilization should have technological levels similar to those found in 1964, a major flaw in our civilization design is evident. So what is a more effective design? How can humans use resources more effectively?</p>

<p>Educate and care for all people on a global scale. There is a potentially slow and costly start-up as developing countries catch up, but the increased worldwide trade infrastructure, energy consumption, and creative potential add up. I think that in less than 3 years the human race can help each other develop into a type 1 civilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Battle of Armageddon caused the Collapse of the Ancient World. 
In conjunction with the destruction of the temple and fall of Jerusalem, the historians Josephus and Tacitus recorded eyewitness accounts of supernatural beings engaged in battle above the city, and a thunderous voice in the temple announced that God was departing. Shortly after, the temple and Jerusalem were destroyed to the foundation stones, which ended the Kingdom of Judah, and the tribe of people called the Jews. That cataclysm was the epicenter of the battle of Armageddon. It destroyed the powerful forces who ruled the advanced civilizations of the ancient world, and humans &quot;inherited the earth.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science paints the world in such a materialistic, detached, colorless way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the problem I&#39;ve had with science since I was in like 3rd grade. I agree it has its place, and it&#39;s very useful, but it by no means grasps everything there is to know, and no empirical study ever will. I am not myself a practitioner of occult or mystic stuff, but I am well aware (based on experiences with LSD) that there is more out there than we trick ourselves into believing every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, you seem to have the same view that I do, but a huge block. When I say that it is not science, I mean because it is ridiculous to try and force the strict definitions that science requires on somthing as personal as spiritual health.

<p>No I personally belive its more of how different ppeople think. Religion as a whole seems to be filled with people who focus on why we are different. Usually by saying how man is better, or worse, than some idea. Were as science seems to look more deeply at how we are the same. How everything works togeather, in a very broad, yet exact, way.</p>

<p>Religious people that I have talked to fail to see the wonder in the way I see the interconnection of everything, from the largest systems to the smallest. Science is truly the most hopeful way of interpreting the world. </p>

<p>Close, but it&#39;s not Christianity I&#39;m concerned about (since Conway isn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think, specifically Christian). Rather, I&#39;m conserned about what his calling himself a &quot;religious scholar&quot; might do to Reddit&#39;s already dim view of religious scholars, who are actually real academics with logical, peer-reviewed methodologies. Christianity only enters into it insomuch that having a needlessly dismal view of religious scholarship makes interacting with Christianity on the credible, logical basis, accepted by the accademy, even more of a hopeless prospect for most Redditors. The same could be said of its impact on the other religions Conway considers too, its just that, Reddit being a mostly <em>Occidental</em> phenomenon, most of the atheist Redditors are post-Christian, not post-Mayan or post-Muslim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 1800s, the French Academy of Sciences offered prize money to any scientist who could conclusively prove that life was either
spontaneous or random—and Louis Pasteur won the contest. When you see a carton of milk that says it is pasteurized, this means it was cooked
to kill all the bacteria—and this process was named after Louis Pasteur. The problem is that Pasteur’s competitors did get life-forms to grow out of
nonliving environments—such as by using preparations of hay that had been totally sterilized in water. Pasteur simply refused to repeat these
experiments. It’s even more disappointing that Pasteur found life that spontaneously appeared in a small percentage of his own experiments, but he
never even wrote about them—because he felt they had to be mistakes, and were not worth mentioning..</p>
