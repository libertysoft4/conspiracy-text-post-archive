This technology is real... how is that a &quot;world out to get me?&quot;  Secrets are not directed at me, they are just secrets; covert technology.

You think you&#39;re important enough to have been fully informed about every bit of covert science on this Earth, right?</p>

<p>Your responses to this point are scripted... you don&#39;t really think for yourself.  You are just saying things that make you feel good, and those things have been scripted throughout society to provide you with this arsenal of words to utter in order to prevent the truth from spreading.  Good job.  You&#39;re a policeman for the ignorant - helping to make sure they remain that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just part of the probability evidence (coincidence).  The science of probability doesn&#39;t lie.  There is a huge amount of evidence out there, probability evidence, proving that quake and weather tech have been used for decades.  These things are not graphed for you to clearly see - they just blame global warming and climate change and the media tells you a limited amount of info to corral you along.  Climate change provides them with a perfect plausible deniability for covert use of this technology.  They promote fossil fuels and give alternative energy half hearted effort at best... the use of fossil fuels allows the climate change plausible deniability because fossil fuels are a plausible cause of climate change.  This is the biggest news story of this and last century, but it is still being well suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you must realize that I have been shown this technology - so I look at events from the perspective of knowing this technology can be used by people as they choose.  The people that decided to do this had to decide when and where to do it.  They knew that the president&#39;s daughter was there... most likely.  I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s absolutely true that the people doing the quake knew about her being there, but there is a very strong likelihood that they knew it given that Obama is the president.  The people that have this technology are relatively few:  Covert factions within the US military, Russia, and likely a few others.  I&#39;m just naming the two I know about.  They knew that this emergency preparedness excercise with a 7.9 earthquake was scheduled for March 20, obviously, so they chose this location and time because of that.  They also, as I&#39;ve said, very likely knew that Obama&#39;s daughter was there.  This, coupled with the excercise, may have been the reason they chose this location/time.  If you knew of the covert, asymmetric type warfare that is happening all the time around the world, you would see the possibility that this was a warning to Obama that they can get to his kids, so... fill in the blank.  </p>

<p>Now, please note, I merely bare in mind the possibilities.  I do not know if that was the actual intent of doing this quake in that location at this time.</p>

<p>As for the other issue, of the quake happening when the excercise was scheduled, nature does not do that.  You really need to get a firm, hardcore grip on probability and nature.  Humans do things like this.  Humans plan &quot;coincidences&quot; like this.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental global factions right now.  One faction would like to transition the world to have a basis in honesty, and the other wants to maintain the world with a basis in deception.  Obama, and most leaders in the US and Europe are on the side of deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  No big deal.  Their may be a causal link, and I never stated that there was, absolutely, a link.  I&#39;m discussing the possibilities. It is a possibility that the Obama connection is as I&#39;ve stated, but I don&#39;t have the actual details of the op.
