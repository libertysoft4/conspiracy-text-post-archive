<p>The back door is in the mobile baseband firmware. This is the chip that processes the signaling commands from the telephone network. None of that is up in the application processor in smartphones.</p>

<p>Yes. See above. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the &quot;hardware guys&quot; who make the mobile baseband chips.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first place I saw this confirmed in the press was an FBI mob prosecution where a dumb-phone was used as a &quot;roving bug.&quot; There have been other confirmations of this capability. Ironically, the more recent ones are about how you should not trust your phone when visiting China and other places with active spying ops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ex-military intelligence analyst here, worked particularly with electromagnetic intelligence, and I can verify this is true.  Hypothetically anything that sends/receives an electromagnetic signal can be &#39;hacked&#39;.  Take an ATM machine for example.  If you attached a highly sensitive sensor near the cabling, you could intercept any data-links that were not protected, decrypt them and have access to all the financial transaction data. If the battery is in, the phone&#39;s receiver will still be capable of receiving transmissions. </p>

<p>And you might detect it if your battery drains mysteriously, especially on a dumb-phone without clever free apps that wake up and download ads. But there really is no way to tell for sure unless you wired your battery to an ammeter and watched for the phone to start using power when it is &quot;off.&quot;</p>

<p>OK. And my question is... is this a backdoor only for US authorities, or can other countries do it? </p>

<p>Also, is it just FBI/CIA/MI5. Or can police do it? Do you just need the phone number, and some special hardware, or is it like a special code + phone number + special equipment?</p>

<p>Is it the kind of thing that organised criminals could access, theoretically...? I&#39;m having a hard time understanding the specifics of this....... I haven&#39;t seen this confirmed anywhere other than the FBI &quot;roving bug&quot; media report, which is really just a media report, and gave no technical specifics.</p>

<p>That is a VERY interesting question. My somewhat educated guess is that the commands for turning on a roving bug are only protected through &quot;security by obscurity&quot; and there is no encryption or authentication beyond what it takes to get the phone on the network.</p>

<p>This stuff is in a grey area. It isn&#39;t what telcos call &quot;Lawful Intercept&quot; (LI), which is something the network does. LI is written into law, and, while the implementation details are restricted, ALL network equipment makers must implement this.</p>

<p>And yet, a roving bug requires the network to send special signaling to make it work. That means that most of the network equipment providers, who sell worldwide, know how to do this. And, being an element of legitimate police investigations, I doubt it could be embargoed from, for example, the Chinese. So, it&#39;s more secret than LI, but there is good reason to think it is almost as widely available and widely used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for &quot;bad guys&quot; accessing this... The bad guys would have to run the telco or the law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>I doubt anyone has ever done this as a &quot;rogue.&quot; That would take knowledge of soft-radio, GSM signalling, and designing an attack that would reveal what is the control signaling for roving bugs. Never say never, but it is much more likely a dirty cop would use this than a common criminal.</p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Surely, a regular person could know someone at the phone company/equipment provider/government agency, and have them spy on someone for them. I see no reason why not.</p>

<p>It all depends what this &quot;special signal&quot; is... whether it&#39;s a constant signal, or whether it changes over time... I mean, if it&#39;s just a signal/device which you can use to do this.... I can definitely imagine a common criminal/well-connected person getting hold of this technology..... I see no reason why not...... Corrupt people are everywhere..... News International bribed British police, despite not being actual police....... Human corruption is everywhere........ You wouldn&#39;t have to run the agency/telco.... You&#39;d just have to know someone there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably got downvoted in the Android subreddit because this article doesn&#39;t mention any OEMs that make Android phones. I&#39;m fairly certain if there were a back door in the kernel or something like that it would be discovered by now since its open source and practically needs to be re-written for every single different device. Surely the mod community would have found a vulnerably such as this by now. It would be possible for OEMs to install some other small application to allow back door access like this but again, you could protect yourself by installing your own version of the OS from the mod community. </p>
