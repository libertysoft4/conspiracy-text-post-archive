<p>In order to believe something, you need proof of it happening.  Do you have any evidence?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The world&#39;s most popular smartphone OS (Android) is open source, and the second most popular (iOS) has been thoroughly hacked and jailbroken.  These types of transmissions would be exceedingly easy to detect, yet none ever have been.  Nor is there any code in place making it possible at all.  Wouldn&#39;t that be the first evidence necessary in believing something like this?</p></li>
<li><p>Mass-surveillance is of little use to any intelligence gathering body, especially camera data.  Peeping into the homes of every living soul makes for a great conceptual novel, but a terribly ineffective and wasteful means of data gathering.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it more, or less likely that a front-facing camera was introduced independently by dozens of phone manufacturers based on consumer demand?</p></li>
<li><p>Front-facing cameras didn&#39;t originate in US-sold phones.  Do countries like Korea have more of an interest in population surveillance?</p></li>
<li><p>With all of the cell phone manufacturers out there, and the constant leaks of yet-to-be-released products to the internet, it would stand to reason that at least one would leaked a memo from the NSA detailing the need to install additional cameras in phones.  Hundreds, or more likely thousands, of engineers, administrative employees, accountants, and programmers would have to be complicit.  Most of them in countries with no interest in furthering US agendas.  Why have none come forward?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence that it&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the easiest evidence to collect, as we have the source code of the most popular OS, and the ability to track all data sent and received from the other popular OS.  These exact techniques have exposed privacy violations such as the iOS &quot;Path&quot; app uploading contact info to their servers without permission.  So why haven&#39;t these techniques exposed large chunks of camera data being sent to the NSA, or any other servers?</p>

<p>In order to say something is happening, you need to have evidence of it happening.  Not speculation that it <em>could</em> happen.  Is there any empirical evidence of cell phone cameras being used for government surveillance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so security firms provide security consulting to law enforcement.  Now that we&#39;ve got that bombshell out of the way... has government camera surveillance data ever been intercepted from a smartphone?</p>

<p>I keep going back to the original assertion of this post, but you keep dancing around it.  All it takes is one photo captured without permission, then transmitted to the government without permission.  This would be exceedingly easy to detect and intercept.  This is the exact sort of thing that hackers and security experts base their careers on finding.  Name one instance of this ever occuring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The product promo for an untested bit of software which <a href="http://kevtownsend.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/hacking-teams-rcs-hype-or-horror-fear-or-fud/">security experts say is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill rootkit</a>.  That&#39;s the part you want to believe out of all of this?  If data needs to get from one place to the next (your phone to NSA headquarters), it <em>has</em> to be sent to them using existing technologies (cellular, wifi, USB).  The types of transmissions that the OP is asserting are happening are <em>not being detected</em> by scientists, security experts, engineers, or anyone else.</p>

<p>My agenda is applying logic and critical thought to the OP&#39;s assertion that front-facing cameras were added to phones because the NSA wasn&#39;t getting adequate data from the rear-facing cameras.  There&#39;s no evidence to support this assertion, but many will add it to their conspiracy lexicon untested, or as Glenn Beckesque questions-as-statements like &quot;don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little <em>odd</em> that all these cameras started showing up in phones?&quot;</p>

<p>If you really think the NSA is dying to know what your ceiling fan is up to, stick a piece of tape on your phone and be done with it.  If you want others to believe you, provide evidence from reliable sources.  I am exceedingly proud to say that I don&#39;t include guesswork and speculation in my worldview, so if I have an agenda, it&#39;s trying to bring a little logic into the room before someone&#39;s lunch break rumination of &quot;hey, extra cameras on phones, I wonder if...&quot; becomes part of the &quot;factual&quot; canon of the internet.  No apologies.  If that&#39;s cunty behaviour, then we need more cunts and fewer blind followers.</p>

<p>Which Scientists are busying themselves fervently searching for these Transmissions?</p>

<p>There are literally thousands of people whose job involves looking for things exactly like this.  RF engineers,  researchers, hackers, security firms...  The iPhone app &quot;Path&quot; was outed in a matter of hours for sending unauthorized data back to Path&#39;s servers.  The hacker who discovered it explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It all started innocently enough. I was thinking of implementing a Path Mac OS X app as part of our regularly scheduled hackathon. Using the awesome mitmproxy tool which was featured on the front page of Hacker News yesterday, I started to observe the various API calls made to Path’s servers from the iPhone app. It all seemed harmless enough until I observed a POST request to <a href="https://api.path.com/3/contacts/add">https://api.path.com/3/contacts/add</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple stuff.  If a phone needs to get information from one point to another, it <em>has to be sent there</em>.  Unless you&#39;re suggesting the phones have a secondary non-standard transmitter, as was a popular theory during the &quot;digital TV converter boxes have hidden cameras&quot; conspiracy from a few years back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is funding them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thousands of different sources.  Some, like our guy above, are doing it for free, so &quot;no one&quot; in their case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What sort of as yet unclassified surveillance transmissions have they detected?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, the evidence points to none.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would they give out this information when they could just sell their detection method? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that&#39;s not how hacking, security or engineering works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still contend you are a cunt with an agenda. </p>

<p>That&#39;s fantastic.  I&#39;d rather be a cunt with critical thinking skills and an eye for logical fallacy, than a non-cunt who follows the pack.</p>

<p>This is literally the topic of this thread:</p>

<p>I believe that having one camera was beginning to cause a problem for the nsa. People usually laid their phones on the camera side.</p>

<p>perhaps that&#39;s not on your agenda today?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in that thread, or in claiming that surveillance is not possible. Of course it is.  The claim is that a surveillance plot so massive is underway that just one camera on a phone isn&#39;t enough to get all the necessary data (shots of ceiling fans, insides of pockets, stuff like that I presume).  There is no evidence of any of this happening.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/r8d2x/phones_with_2_cameras/c43rzhi">Read my original comment again</a> and again let me know if we are or aren&#39;t discussing the NSA forcing cell phone manufacturers to change hardware and software at their behest.</p>

<p>Do you believe that front-facing cameras were a consumer-driven innovation, or an NSA plot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s not impossible. If the NSA wants to turn your camera on, they can find or buy a way. There is evidence that every single sensor contained in your device can be activated remotely. I provided that to you. The only evidence you pointed to that counters that claim, is the lack of someone who could make a ton of money by selling the info deciding not to and disclosing the exploit for some google chump change, or just gratis. In fact, every exploit that is closed, was at one time open. The product info I provided you even admits that their ability manipulates zero day exploits, which by definition are temporary. Aside from that, you have no idea what backdoors are present in Google, or Microsoft products. Your only hope that there is none, is just that, hope. OP&#39;s post is paranoid in thinking the NSA dictates product rollout, and that he is somehow interesting enough to spy on.   </p>
