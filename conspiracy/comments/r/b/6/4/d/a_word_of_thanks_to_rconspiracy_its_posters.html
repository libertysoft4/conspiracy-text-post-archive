        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello Fellow truth seekers  </p>

<p>I wanted to share some thoughts with everyone after a stressfull week, in the middle of a stressfull month, 1/4  of the way through what I&#39;m sure will be one of our strangest years. Without concentrating too much on outside groups or other subreddits, I want to preface this missive with the background that has brought me to it&#39;s writing. I am, by no means, new to reddit. I have a thank-you card from Helen Thomas, more likely her secretary, thanking me for sending her flowers as did quite a few other redditors. That was back when reddit was smaller, we all were of the same mindset more or less, and our only antagonists were ensconced in positions of power in governments and corporations around the world. We have changed much since then, we have changed much this year. You may notice this account is a week or so old, not the years I profess to having been posting here. That is because I deleted my account. Perhaps that was a rash decision, but it was one I felt needed to be made. There were years of comments in it, comments made when I felt safe on reddit, comments made when I felt safe in this country (US), and those aren&#39;t feelings I currently hold about anyplace anymore. It doesn&#39;t feel good to be attacked, I think we can all agree to that fact. It feels worse when the attacks aren&#39;t on a personal basis, but organized by groups to attack other groups. That behavior is something I detest in humans, and I like it even less on the internet. Because of those feelings I have reacted with unnecessary anger at people who organize themselves to come bother us. This isn&#39;t serious business, after all, it&#39;s only reddit. I want to apologize to everyone who regularly posts to r/conspiracy for that, it won&#39;t happen again. With that out of the way, on to my point.   </p>

<p>r/conspiracy is, in a lot of ways, much like reddit orginally was. It&#39;s about the same size, people are open to most everything, and we willingly help each other out with information, tips, maybe just some life advice. There are no off limit topics, we are not constrained by politcal affiliation, religious beliefs, or any other prison people wish to contain themselves in. Where ever particular people congregate is what we discuss. Be they politicians, Zionists, Zeta Riticulins, whatever. We are not judgemental as a group and only seek information, free and open information. Some of us are assholes, some of us are crazy, and that&#39;s just fine.  </p>

<p>I do not believe everything posted here, no one does. What I do believe is that I am able to dissect information to arrive at a coherent and sober understanding of it. If that information is not free flowing, my understanding begins to lessen. If nothing else, the sheer multitude of theories presented here increases our ability to reason critically. I believe Conspirists are better equipped to look through stories presented by our representative media, to view important events with the suspicion they deserve, and come to our own conclusions. We make up our own minds. Perhaps some of the time we get it wrong, perhaps some people believe things that are not based in reality, but I think 
we all believe that attempting to control someone&#39;s beliefs, the answers they arrive at, or what information they have access to, are some of the worst activities people are capable of. Just a tiny piece of information can lead to wondrous insights, and that is why I come to r/conspiracy, and that is why I&#39;m writing this to you. I am constantly learning new things because of posts here. Amazing things, and I am always received with an open mind. I really hope that continues.  </p>

<p>Let me give you one, kinda two, examples of what I am talking about. Highlady420 pointed me in the direction of a movie called 
&quot;Evidence of Revision&quot; a few days ago. The movie deals with the assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK, as well as the Jonestown Massacres. It is 9 hours long, and at first I thought I would never watch it. I did though, not intently, but I had it on for a couple days in the background as I worked. This one movie, given out because I complained about the ordering of titles relating to the subject on youtube, changed my entire week, perhaps my life and marriage. I&#39;ll stray away from the conspiracy aspects of the film and keep it to tangible effects. </p>

<p>The MLK portion of the film presents quite a few excerpts of MLK&#39;s speeches. I had never really listened to the man. There is the &quot;I have a dream speech&quot; and some background info I knew because I was forced to at one point, but that was really it. As the movie played I found myself unable to concentrate on my work, and instead could only hear his words. This isn&#39;t revelatory, but I had never actually listened to him talk. Check out this excerpt from a speech given in <a href="http://youtu.be/FjYCcwYnmU8">1960</a>. Is that not absolutly amazing? I don&#39;t care who you are, you could be the most racist bastard around, but you cannot deny the prescience of that man. Those words were spoken over fifty years ago, they could have been made yesterday and we&#39;d be applauding their speaker. It Just blew me away. I ended up getting every speech of his I could from the library, I am engrossed with him; on Monday I knew the date of his death and the first line of a speech.</p>

<p>The Jonestown section is just as enlightening. I found out Jim Jones came from the same town my wife does. I contacted my father-in-law about him, turns out he had met him on many occasions. He told me everything he could remember about the monkey man, and as that conversation wound down, we continued to talk for a couple of hours. That conversation is the longest I have ever spoken with him at one time in the decade or so since I started sleeping with his daughter. It was satisfying, and real. That conversation may very well completely alter the way I interact with my wife&#39;s family, for the better. My life is now different, and improved, because someone gave me a playlist I asked for in a comment. She wasn&#39;t attacked after that for posting &quot;crazyiness&quot;, and she had no idea if I would think the content was loonacy or not.</p>

<p>What I want you to take away from this, if you read it, is that the more freedom, the more information we are given, the better we will be as people, as participants in the world, and even just here at reddit. I want anyone who reads this to feel good about being suspicious, about digging for truth and meaning, even if all you find is more bullshit. I want you all to continue making up your own minds, and freely helping others to make up theirs. Keep the information flowing, and thanks for your time.</p>

<p>tl;dr - r/conspiracy is a magical place, full of crazy, awesome, goodness, and it better goddamned stay that way. </p>

<p>Nobody here cares about Jews, we care about murderous oppressive lying pieces of shit. There are plenty in this category regardless of religious background.</p>

<p>Your comment shows that you may not be cable of the critical thought required to separate your emotional attachment to fear of racism from your ability to discern the truth in any given situation.</p>

<p>Please make sure you watch several other docs, most importantly &quot;human resources&quot; - which, I think, will provide more insight into the who and the why people like MLK are killed.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> allows for a true open forum of thought, and it is important we protect it from usurpment.</p>
