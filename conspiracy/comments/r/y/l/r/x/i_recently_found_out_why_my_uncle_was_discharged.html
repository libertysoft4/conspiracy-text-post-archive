        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Among his claims:</p>

<p>Witness to a UFO over fort Knox, which precipitated him being recruited into a group that did manual labor and mechanical work underground</p>

<p>Witness to <a href="http://www.rense.com/ufo/boringmachine.htm">high tech drilling machines</a> able to bore through solid rock at incredible pace</p>

<p>Witness to triangular and disc shaped craft used to transport cargo to and from the moon</p>

<p>Claims he was transferred to Germany before being discharged because he asked too many questions.  He says that many (but not all) in his platoon who were not recruited after the UFO incident denied it ever happened, even though he know they saw it.</p>

<p>Btw, this wouldn&#39;t be the first UFO incident near fort Knox...see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantell_UFO_incident">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantell_UFO_incident</a></p>

<p>I plan on doing a full interview with him, he is truly concerned that his life would be in danger if his identity was revealed.</p>

<p>If he feels his life is in danger, that&#39;s all the more reason to speak out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Since the information is already released, a major incentive of intimidation or harm is removed.</li>
<li>If something happens anyway, it only looks more suspicious.</li>

<p>The DC Madam had information she wanted to release, but never did... and she ended up dead.  What she knew will never be known as a result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are the &quot;symptoms&quot; of schizotypal, for those interested.  sounds like anyone who isn&#39;t a drone and is open to reality could be diagnosed with this.</p>

<p>Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference) 
Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g. superstition, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, &quot;sixth sense&quot;, or bizarre fantasies or preoccupations) 
Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions Odd thinking and speech (e.g. vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, or stereotyped speaking) 
Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation Inappropriate or constricted affect Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric or peculiar Lack of close friends or confidants other than first degree relatives
 Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>man you&#39;ve got to be kidding. Go read that thread again! The guy came in with his claims of knowledge sounding like a fool and even still reddit respected him and played nice. The crowd should&#39;ve been rough and it should&#39;ve been an upward battle to be taken seriously right from the start, but instead people were asking normal questions interested to hear what answers he would bring to the table. So the guy then proceeds to copy and paste the same nonsense reply to like 30 posts in a row. Seriously this paste job didn&#39;t even make sense by itself, and it wasn&#39;t relevant at all to pretty much any post it responded to, but there it was 30 times. The guy asked for his downvotes, it had nothing to do with any minority. Even after this happened he started answering questions more normally, people were finding his responses in the the thread and following along, but even still his answers were all inadequate and all he did was claim a bunch of knowledge while not making any sense. I was there, were you there? This is what happened!</p>

<p>EDIT, also <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a> didn&#39;t try to get the IAMA cancelled. I investigated that too, did you? What they did was simply object to the claims that this author was an academic or had credentials, because he didn&#39;t, but the mods for some reason allowed him to pass as though he did. For real, go look that up too, you&#39;re way off, they even specified really clearly the whole time that they weren&#39;t trying to silence anything, it&#39;s plain as day if you read it.</p>

<p>EDIT 2 one of the guys from <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a> even came here and clarified extensively, even while <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was being alarmist and twisting the story around. He was very nice and clear even as people were insulting him, his subreddit, his religion etc. for no reason. I believe his name was TruthBeTold or TruthWillBeTold or something, if I recall he had education in the fields of theology/textual analysis and his only point was that analysis of historical documents was a very particular discipline this author was not qualified to associate himself with. Point being, it wasn&#39;t a religious censorship issue etc., it was just a false credentials issue <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> blew out of proportion and tried to turn into a coverup like they do with pretty much everything.</p>

<p>EDIT 3 his name was <a href="/u/TurretOpera">/u/TurretOpera</a> (derp)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he told me that he believes our concept of aliens is a psyop, and that what we call greys are biological machines sent back from future earth humans to correct something in the past to help their future survive.  This resulted in the Roswell crash, which screwed up both our timeline and theirs, because the military industrial complex was essentially given super technology from the reverse engineering of their craft.  He said a lot of our modern day mainstream tech has also come out of this engineering work, including semiconductors and fiber optics.  He says that he does not consider flying saucers spacecraft so much as he  considers them time machines.  The ability to fly interstellar, he says, means you also have the ability to move through time.  He says he personally did not witness &quot;aliens&quot; or other such beings underground, as he was just doing manual/mechanical labor. But he did say he saw the aforementioned tetrahedrally shaped crafts.  He said it was absolutely massive in size...as large as a football field, or thereabouts.  Actually, I can&#39;t remember if he was saying the craft was that large or the hangar that housed it was that large...I will clarify when i do the interview.</p>
