        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had the chance to talk to a friend of mine who just got back from a 1 year deployment in the single largest opium producing province of Afghanistan.  When he first arrived this time last year there was poppy growing EVERYWHERE, even in front of the local government offices.  A few months into the deployment they had a Law Enforcement liaison attached to them and opium production was officially declared illegal.</p>

<p>After that point he said production was forced &quot;underground&quot; and out of the public eye.  That also allowed the Marines and ANA to start seizing drugs and drug money.  My Marine friend recounted individual instances where they seized &quot;black tar heroin&quot; (raw opium paste) by the metric ton as well as Hashish and cash money.</p>

<p>So I will ask the same question I always ask, does anyone have any proof that the US military (not the CIA) is currently involved in the opium trade?  I have been told at least twice here that it is &quot;common knowledge&quot; that the US government really runs drugs so this should be pretty easy to prove. </p>

<p>As for the C.I.A.

<p>It&#39;s a double-edge sword taking away the drug trade in Afghanistan, either you hurt the world&#39;s worst economy even more, or you support the trade of hard drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Veteran here. I wouldn&#39;t say they &quot;run&quot; the drugs, but during my deployments, a blind eye was definitely turned to the massive amounts of poppy that was being grown throughout the country. Think about it, this is a war for the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan. Either they side with us because we offer a better life or they side with the taliban because they offer a better life. If we disrupted their opium trade we&#39;d be removing the only source of income for large populations of people in this country. It&#39;d be similar to taking corn away from farmers in America. This is their livelihood. Any attempts to &quot;stop the opium trade&quot; by the us government is simply a dog and pony show for the media.

<p>Where were you and in what year?  Only about a quarter of the country&#39;s landmass can be farmed at all so in the areas that can be farmed they are generally planted heavy.  The level of open production will really depend on the local government but I am getting a lot of reports like I mentioned in the OP, where they are cracking down on stuff out in the open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video doesn&#39;t prove anything. US troops have been present in opium fields in Afghanistan. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re &quot;guarding&quot; opium production or involved in the opium trade.

    <div class="md"><p>Right off the bat you can see that he has no understanding of the situation.  It is true that the Taliban did enforce a couple of 1 year bans on opium production while they were holding the only regions of the country that could grow poppy.  Why would they do this?  These bans coincide almost exactly with the lowest global prices for heroin in recent history.  During this time of extremely cheap opium paste the warlords would buy it by the ton and hide it in caves.  After taking 90% of the world&#39;s opium production offline for 12 months, supply and demand kicks in and the price skyrockets.  The various warlords would then sell their horded opium at the peak of the market and walk away with millions just based on speculation.</p>

<p>The part about Pat Tillman writing letters home about them growing opium is a balled face lie.  After about 10 minutes of googling I found literally the only source to be Alex Jones and this video.  No copies of the letters, no one in his profoundly anti-military, anti-war family speaking up, nothing but Alex Jones&#39; word.</p>

<p>He keeps asserting that the US troops are &quot;growing the opium&quot; but I have yet to meet anyone who says that is what they did while there.  Why are there not pictures?  How about some kind of physical proof?  Without that these are just assertions and damned disrespectful ones from where I sit.</p>

<p>See my above post about Karzai&#39;s brother.  He was a CIA informant and it was a public secret that he was involved in drugs.  That in and of itself does not prove that the CIA&#39;s policy was to produce opium.  To prove that you need more than just &quot;they worked together on terrorism&quot;.</p>

<p>Holy shit, the Geraldo video totally proves the man is full of shit.  Notice the soldiers are talking about WATCHING the opium be grown?  Didn&#39;t Alex just say they were doing it themselves?  Regular military have no mandate to pull up poppy and doing so would simply drive the locals into the hands of the Taliban.  Can you think of a better solution in that situation?  All that being said, the DEA has been sending teams in to do busts since 2001, why isn&#39;t Alex covering that?</p>

<p>The key is that the US chooses whom in what areas are to grow poppy unaffected by the military incursion.  Poppy production is the independent variable...no matter what, it will consistently continue where possible, because of the economic incentive (and its ability to fund Taliban).  The independent variable is the US&#39; monopoly on violence throughout Afghanistan, and its ability to choose to wield its sword in this area, but not that area...</p>

<p>It works exactly the same way in Mexico, which takes its orders on what groups its military actively pursues from the US (and don&#39;t tell me it doesn&#39;t when the US funds and arms the military and arms the cartels).  Don&#39;t you see that the real issue is the US providing the conditions for monopolies (in drugs, guns, you name it) to flourish?  The US and western govts&#39; policies have been characterized as empowering one group over the other, because one group is much easier to control than many.  Think Saddam, Pinochet, the Shah, etc!</p>

<p>Now, I BELIEVE the same applies in Afghanistan (I say I believe because proof is difficult to come by as Afghanistan is a journalistic dead zone with no rule of law or authority outside of large cities, which is not where poppy is grown).  One area is pursued, poppies are cut down and the cameras are flashing and the US appears to be doing a good deed; meanwhile there are vast areas in Afghanistan where poppies are allowed to grow, and who knows who controls these areas, and how the heroin gets into other markets when most supply routes are US CONTROLLED!</p>

<p>We are here to ask questions on r/conspiracy...not write stupid articles like the originator of this post that are based on empiricism and the hearsay of one or a few soldiers.  In reality we will not find proof of this for a long time...but if we look at history it becomes clear that many speculations, like this one, were actually well founded and true.   </p>

<p>The tail numbers are registered to companies, at least a few of which are legit to the point that they are suing the CIA for back pay.  Blackwater got most of the contracts dealing with black sites since their pilots were cleared to fly into and out of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality is that like drug production and distribution in the United States, it is not one singular agency that makes the drugs available or sells the drugs.  A big reason why the United States has been able to get away with providing heroin to its citizens is by making it a stepped process where the DEA/CIA/NSA play different active roles in making drugs like crack cocaine an heroin available to the ghettos of America and the world.</p>

<p>The drug and money flows are much easier to control and potentially profit from when the agencies choose to allow one gang, or group access to the American market, while their competitors are pursued.  This makes it much more easy to control and skim money off the top.  Look into Michael Ruppert&#39;s work on the CIA/DEA making crack cocaine available to the ghettos.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, one agency&#39;s intel and busts (DEA) represents opportunity for another agency (CIA).  Think of the DEA/NSA/Military as the intelligence gathering wings that establish the ground rules for the CIA to effectively channel drugs into various markets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Embedded journalism, which is the only form of on-the-ground journalism available to us from places like Afghanistan, is very much kept in check, and you should know this.  We do not have a clear picture of what happens on the ground, but we do have piles upon piles of proof that the CIA and military in, South America for example, made the American market available with safe passage to certain groups, and also made drugs available to the American people.</p>

<p>Use your critical thinking skills, rather than pronouncing an absence of proof you speak of, as proof itself...the US &#39;Carebears&#39; are saving Afghan lives one hug at a time!  </p>

<p>For example, if you look at Operation Northwoods, where the US government planned in excrutiating detail to carry out terrorist attacks on its own civilians to justify war, it raises the question...if they did it then, then who is to say they would not do it now.  It does not presuppose that the US carried out 9/11, but in light of Northwoods and many incidents like the Gulf of Tonken where war was started over a completely false attack, it certainly raises some serious questions about the state of world affairs today.</p>

<p>And as far as your argument goes with the &quot;hockey game&quot;, go fuck yourself if you can&#39;t discuss things without veiled insults on other peoples&#39; intelligence.  The linear logic of yourself and the chap that posted: &quot;I talked to a friend on duty in Afghanistan, so it must be the whole story&quot; is just dumbfounding.  Empiricist idiots!  </p>

<p>Also, asking me to provide you with a citation immediately confers legitimacy to your argument without you yourself providing proof to the contrary!  These are all questions we are asking on this conspiracy thread, don&#39;t you see?  We don&#39;t know for sure, but with all the historical proof of what our governments have done to maintain power in the past, you have to ask these questions and try to answer them, unless you are part of the problem...which it appears you are!</p>

<p>WE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT GOES DOWN ON THE GROUND IN AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE IT IS A JOURNALISTIC DEADZONE AND A PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE ANY RESEMBLANCE OF LAW HAS BEEN DISMANTLED.  The US and other governments have a wild west situation there, please tell me you don&#39;t deny this!</p>

<p>Also, please do not forget the Iran Contra scandal and the recent scandal with cartels being paid by Iran to kill the Suadi ambassador (which has so many frigging holes in it) when you try to suggest the US government does not have a hand in dealing with drug cartels when it is to their benefit!!!</p>

<p>Afghanistan has almost no oil, some natural gas and fairly hard to extract rare earth minerals.  The strongest political force in the country outside the US propped up government are a band of 14th century religious fundamentalist with ties to global jihadist movement.  I am not sure how much you know about drilling and mineral extraction in hostile regions but the US doesn&#39;t have a great history there.  This is the key reason why not a single US oil company even bid on Iraqi fields.</p>

<p>You sound like a Fox News anchor.  Well known to people who frequent conspiracy sites maybe.  I do a lot of reading about the CIA and operations and I only ever hear accounts of individuals or small groups of people &quot;going rogue&quot;.  Also, all those accounts take place in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s without any proof other than &quot;everyone knows&quot; that it still happens today.</p>

<p>Do you have proof that as a matter of policy the CIA distributes drugs today?  Also what drugs, produced where and consumed where?  The first sign someone has been parroting Alex Jones and not reading multiple sources is &quot;America is in Afghanistan for the opium&quot; since almost none of the opium produced in Afghanistan ends up on the streets of the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much do you know about Afghan politics?  EVERYONE in a position of power is currently or has been involved in the opium trade.  Even the Taliban were would guard fields and escort convoys out of the country because before the US invasion it was the single most profitable business in the entire country.  I&#39;ll let you in on another secret, everyone currently or formerly in power in that country is either a war criminal or a pedophile.  Ahmed Shah Massoud, the man who Osama had killed on 9/9 and the single best hope for beating back the Taliban and uniting the country used to put prisoners in shipping containers and leave them in the desert to bake alive.</p>

<p>It was no real secret that Ahmed Wali Karzai was involved in the drug trade and working with the CIA.  Again, this might come as a bit of a shock to you but the CIA will deal with terrorist, drug lords and criminals to get the access or information they want.  Proving that a man the CIA paid for information is involved in the opium trade doesn&#39;t in any way prove that the agency itself or the wider military is involved.  That is guilt by association, your friend is a drug dealer so we should lock you up since you spend lots of time with him and must deal drugs as well.</p>

<p>It was within our strategic interest to let it flourish during the Cold War, almost none of the opium produced in Afghanistan makes it to America.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually the CIA gave weapons, ammo, food, medicine and even mules to the Pakistani ISI who took them into Afghanistan and gave them to mostly Pashtun warlords.</p>

<p>Yes but the question is why?  Why would they do that?  Also, why was it only banned in one year periods?</p>

<p>A lot of that has to do with the total lack of a central government.  We destroyed the Taliban&#39;s infrastructure in a month or 2 and if no one is telling you that you can&#39;t plant the FAR more profitable plant, why wouldn&#39;t you?  What good would it have done the US to destroy all the poppy they encountered?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again I don&#39;t think you realize the level of corruption in Afghanistan.  Almost all the regional warlords have fought each other, fought along side each other, participated in some level of the drug trade (production, taxation, protection...) and committed what we in the West consider war crimes.  Wali Karzai was involved in the drug trade, there is no doubts there, shit they even killed him.  He was also a paid CIA informant and all those 2 pieces of information prove is that the CIA is willing to work with criminals (nothing new).  I am not saying it is impossible that the CIA was helping him move/grow/produce drugs but there is no proof that he was anything more than a paid informant.</p>

<p>Fun fact, Dostum sent his Russian trained aircraft techs to the Taliban so they could use the old Air Force during their takeover of the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before the US went into Afghanistan, there was no opium trade. It had been abolished by the fanatical Muslim regime that gave a safe haven to Osama Bin Laden. After the US troops took over, they army began to protect the opium fields from terrorists. There is video of this. Production went from zero under the Muslims to 90% of world production under the Americans. That&#39;s a lot of money. Use your common sense -- do you really think American troops and American business wasn&#39;t skimming some of that opium money? Do you really think they stopped doing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again I will point out that the bans only lasted a year and just so happened to take place right at the very time the opium market was flooded.  You also might want to look into the pre-Taliban history of Afghanistan because the trade moved over the border from Pakistan in the late 70&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you can&#39;t get the empirical evidence that you&#39;re looking for, why don&#39;t you start looking at motive, means and circumstance?</p>

<p>Just use some simple reasoning. Who benefits from the war on drugs? Why do we have the war on drugs?</p>

<p>The US Government says that it&#39;s because &quot;drugs are bad for you&quot; but meanwhile alcohol and tobacco are still legal. What does that say to you?</p>

<p><em>Honestly, you don&#39;t even need to know this. You don&#39;t need to see this one little tree in order to see the whole forest.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey matt, I just wanted to apologize for being harsh in my attitude towards your question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surrounded by people who don&#39;t see the big picture the way that I see it and it gets a little frustrating. Lashing out at people is NOT the way to teach them though, so I apologize for my utter failure in that regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. Truth is truth even if you don&#39;t believe it. Truth is truth no matter how many convincing lies are told to cover it up. Truth is truth even if you personally have no evidence of it. Truth is truth, period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much do you know about Afghan politics?  EVERYONE in a position of power is currently or has been involved in the opium trade.  Even the Taliban were would guard fields and escort convoys out of the country because before the US invasion it was the single most profitable business in the entire country.  I&#39;ll let you in on another secret, everyone currently or formerly in power in that country is either a war criminal or a pedophile.  Ahmed Shah Massoud, the man who Osama had killed on 9/9 and the single best hope for beating back the Taliban and uniting the country used to put prisoners in shipping containers and leave them in the desert to bake alive.</p>

<p>It was no real secret that Ahmed Wali Karzai was involved in the drug trade and working with the CIA.  Again, this might come as a bit of a shock to you but the CIA will deal with terrorist, drug lords and criminals to get the access or information they want.  Proving that a man the CIA paid for information is involved in the opium trade doesn&#39;t in any way prove that the agency itself or the wider military is involved.  That is guilt by association, your friend is a drug dealer so we should lock you up since you spend lots of time with him and must deal drugs as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did I ever say the Afghan government was perfect?  EVERYONE, fucking E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E involved with the upper levels of Afghan government is corrupt.

    <div class="md"><p>really? these sources also backed up the claim to Iraqs WMDs. Your missing the point, the taliban did in fact ban opium and were on their way to eradicating it in Afghanistan and pockets of resistance namely the Northern Alliance and other warlords  kept up production. The Taliban or whatever they call the insurgency did take up production of Opium again to fund their insurgency. </p>
