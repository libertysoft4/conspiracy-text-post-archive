        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can&#39;t find a link to the episode yet, my apologies. The gang gets the itch to do a viral video and make a web presence for themselves and Paddy&#39;s. While discussing social networking, Mac went on one of his rants. Here is a quote from that rant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole world is connected. It&#39;s connected by Bill Gates, and that Rain Man Zuckerberg. He and his Jews have connected the whole world and now they&#39;re toppling regimes, and Egypt, and Japan, and the Jews are all...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he gets cut off.</p>

<p>Anyway, just a funny truther moment on a fairly popular show that caught my attention.
If anyone can find the episode (The Anti-Social Network), it happens fairly early on in Paddy&#39;s.</p>

<p>in just about every single episode there&#39;s an instance of mac or charlie expressing some ridiculously ignorant untruth as something they truly believe. </p>

<p>so mac says something you agree with, and now think he&#39;s offering sage advice? no my friend, he was making fun of you. </p>

<p>That kind of says it all as Oliver Stone found out.

    <div class="md"><p>I hope someone can find the clip and post it. They were obviously making a point in some subtle way. Whether it was pushing the point of Jewish conspiracies or making fun of conspiracy theories. Hollywood is a Jewish dictatorship and really not a soft dictatorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;d say they were making fun of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>notice the type of people who said those things. just a few episodes ago, they were talking about how little kid beauty pageants are the essence of america. they come up with crazy ignorant shit like that in most of the epidodes. </p>

<p>the characters represent ignorant, self-absorbed, and undeservingly confident people. their actions and words are a warning of what to avoid should you not want to end up with their hollow, depraved lives. (although it&#39;s fucking hilarious, for sure.) </p>

<p>so when a guy like frank talks about how the media &quot;hypes everything up, just hyping it up&quot; you&#39;re supposed to remember that he&#39;s the guy who uses one knife for both eating and toe-picking, boils denim he finds in a nasty philly river, and is generally a pretty depraved asshole. </p>

<p>when a guy like mac blames it all on the jews, you&#39;re supposed to remember that he&#39;s the guy who has a hugely warped view of what america is and what it represents. he&#39;s very rarely correct in anything he ever says, yet he doesn&#39;t let external arguements convince him of something he has firm belief in. </p>

<p>... so what part of that made OP think mac was giving the silent nod to conspiracy theorists? are people really that bad at analyzing things like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to point out that the cast are also the writers, producers, and creators of the show. While the characters are ignorant and loud, the show itself is snappy and smartly written (tho it is getting a big overblown as the seasons go on). The “gang” has used the show to point out the absurdities of many American systems, including welfare, false-patriotism, and political favoritism, and have more than once taken a non-mainstream approach to Jewish relations (The Gang Goes Jihad, anyone?). These people are not stupid, and I personally believe that they are at least halfway “awake”. When they put remarks like that into the show, I believe they are using it as a platform to plant little seeds of truth into people’s brains…even if it is in a loud, stoned kind of way. You can see it as making fun of us if you want, but that isn’t the vibe I get from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look, again, normally they say those things to highlight how stupid some people can be. so mac says something stupid, and <em>just because you agree with it</em> you think he&#39;s suggesting that it&#39;s actually true? that&#39;s actually the opposite of what you just said to justify it. </p>

<p>they have subtle points, true, but it&#39;s typically &quot;don&#39;t be useless drunken jackasses.&quot; </p>

<p>so, if what you just said is the case, what they&#39;ve done is a total flip-flop from what they usually do. that makes no sense. </p>

<p>your confirmation bias is blinding you. they were making fun of you and you dont&#39; want to admit it, because you&#39;d rather be able to blame the jews for everything without feeling like an idiot. </p>

<p>edit- ok, an example involving myself to illustrate this point. </p>

<p>the south park from a couple weeks ago about wikileaks? that pissed me off. no matter what my personal grievances against wikileaks happen to be, i think it&#39;s a good thing overall. but what south park did was say that it&#39;s just a glorified gossip project. </p>

<p>even though it was 100% ineffective and proved to be just a distraction, i still got pissed that south park wrote it off so harshly. i didn&#39;t even finish the episode because they were pissing me off. </p>

<p>it made me confront the dual opinion in my head that wikileaks was both good and bad. i didn&#39;t like having to confront that in the middle of a comedy show, so i turned it off. </p>

<p>with you, you didn&#39;t want to confront the fact that they were making fun of your belief system. you instead tried to rationalize that they weren&#39;t making fun of you, but were secretly agreeing with you through a two-layered metaphor. that is not true. it is not a double-layered metaphor that gives the thumbs-up to conspiracy theorists. it is a joke that ignorant morons think the jews are behind everything. </p>

<p>i&#39;m sorry you&#39;re not letting yourself see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh my god. oh my fucking god. you&#39;re a <strong>FUCKING MORON.</strong></p>

<p>i got curious, so i downloaded the episode and started to watch it. (i was going to wait for later this weekend when i was supposed to watch it with someone else.) </p>

<p>you <strong>actually believe</strong> this was a coded message of support for anti-zionists? the <strong>fuck is wrong with you?</strong></p>

<p>i&#39;ve been arguing with an idiot. you are not intelligent. i can&#39;t believe i&#39;ve wasted this much time. </p>

<p>it is totally obvious that they&#39;re making fun of ignorant fucks who think the jews are behind everything. (that sentiment has been around for a long time, and has nothing to do with the recent wave of protests against bankers.) </p>

<p>how can you watch what i just watched and not understand that very simple scene? ask me how i know you have no education or experience with analyzing works of art. </p>
