        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">53</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2011-11-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/drexhex.html">drexhex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see on <a href="http://www.fema.gov/emergency/ipaws/eas_info.shtm">this page</a> that &quot;An End of Message (EOM) will be used to close the EAN (an Emergency Action Termination will NOT be used).&quot;  </p>

<p>However, I read on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Action_Notification">wikipedia</a> and on the online <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?type=simple;c=ecfr;cc=ecfr;sid=9c0c99561300256f561b455547263415;region=DIV1;q1=emergency%20action%20termination;rgn=div8;view=text;idno=47;node=47%3A1.0.1.1.12.3.237.2">Electronic Code of Federal Regulations</a> that &quot;Normal programming cannot resume until the transmission of an Emergency Action Termination message (SAME code: EAT).&quot;  </p>

<p>and &quot;Upon receipt of the Emergency Action Termination, the common carriers shall disconnect the originating source and the participating independent stations and restore the networks and other EAS Participants to their original configurations.&quot;  </p>

<p>I also read that &quot;[after transmitting the EOM], key EAS and Participating National sources must transmit a common emergency message until receipt of the Emergency Action Termination Message.&quot;  </p>

<p>Does this mean that the test is not going to end, since an &quot;Emergency Action Termination will NOT be used&quot;?  </p>

<p>If so, what is the &quot;common emergency message&quot; being transmitted during the test?  </p>

<p>EDIT to add: Here is the EAS handbook given to broadcast companies - it says the same thing! EAS activation, EAN notification, then EOM transmitted, and finally the EAT terminates the EAS. <a href="http://www.wpr.org/eas/DOC-278628A3.pdf">http://www.wpr.org/eas/DOC-278628A3.pdf</a>  </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Here is the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/eas/EAS%20Handbook%20-%20National%20Test.pdf">EAS handbook</a> specifically for the Nationwide test. They&#39;re leaving it up to each broadcast station to supply their own visual cues that it is only a test, but the audio will specify that it&#39;s a test. It also says no EAT will be transmitted. If this was a real test of the system in place, why wouldn&#39;t they follow the same procedures as a real emergency?</p>

I am distressed though that the emergency management division of the federal government is preparing for martial law by ensuring they can disable all communications. This is a real wake up call America. If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound? Not if we disable it&#39;s cellphone and Internet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but they did not go out of their way to inform everybody that they were having those tests. Those tests were designed to fool the participants, whose compliance was necessary, into believing that they were <em>simulating</em> what was actually happening. This test is being widely publicized. They are telling people NOT to act like they would if it was a real notification of a real emergency. </p>

<p>To me, the phrase hidden in plain sight means that something that was important escaped our notice because we assumed it was unimportant. This is neither unimportant nor escaping our notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that international corporations are bent on globalism. One aspect of globalism is one world government. Another is culling the herd. I think there are tribalists who, in cooperation with these idea, want to kill as many people outside their tribe as possible. I think the Americans have been complicit with this endless war scenario. I am constantly trying to make people aware of what is going on in their name. Sometimes I use shock, sometime empathy, sometimes mockery. The point is the FEMA test is to strengthen its authority and control NOT to tip us off that they are going to take control. It is ordinary people doing ordinary things (without thinking of the implications or unintended outcomes) that have got us into the mess we are in and we need to understand what they are doing and why so we can correct them and get them to work with us to turn things around. Comic book or action movie scenarios are implanted in our minds so that we cannot easily distinguish between fantasy and reality. I am here to help draw the line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just spent 90 minutes on a call regarding this mess of a test.  Trust me, this thing is so disorganized, I&#39;d be surprised if anybody even sees the test.  No conspiracy here...Normally the EOM is simply used by the EAS gear to indicate when the alert message has concluded, and for the equipment to return to normal operation.  The logic for this national test is as follows:  For something to happen that would call for a &quot;National EAN alert&quot;, it would have to be a major event, right?  Well, the EAN alert simply force tunes your television to a channel that will carry the actually carry the content of the alert (video and audio).  This channel will be a local affiliate broadcaster (ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, PBS).  Normally, at the conclusion of an EAN, and end of message indicator would cause the television to tune back to whatever you were watching prior to the alert.  But because such a national event would normally be very serious, you&#39;d want to make sure people keep their eyes and ears on the news.  Thus, no end-of-message indicator means no automatically tuning back to Young and the Restless or Jersey Shore or whatever.  If you choose to change the channel back, you can simply by doing it yourself.</p>

<p>An emergency alert message is just a message.  Just because the message doesn&#39;t &quot;end&quot;, there isn&#39;t an emergency of infinite length.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think you might be right.  I also think that it&#39;s possible that we attack Iran on the ninth.  Which could lead to WW3, an extinction level event with a notable impact of November.  Obama clearly had a defined reason for those 20K troops here at home. Plus, with all the war cries going off right now, it seems possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder about the &quot;Operation Mountain Guardian&quot; (OMG) exercise from a few weeks ago.. An exercise where top military, NASA, and gov brass were all in Denver, where the military was guarding them while they were bunkered, etc.</p>

<p>Seems to me, they were rehearsing a drill where an ELE was occurring.. say YU55 for example, which is not believed to be a danger to the earth, but who knows.  Maybe it is.  Or, maybe WW3 is coming, or maybe they know that given financial collapse, there&#39;ll be a hell of a lot of hungry americans wanting answers and food, so maybe they&#39;re going to hide out in the mountains till the common folk are no longer a danger.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my point is OMG was an exercise to protect the underground facilities in the mountains.  Who are they protecting them from?  The american people, that&#39;s who.  Why? No idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just pointing out that WW3 has the possibility of ending all life on the planet if it got really out of hand. Even so, an E.L.E. is simply a period of time when diversity of life decreases extensively. With the tactical nuclear, spent uranium, biological, and conventional weapons at the world&#39;s disposal, it is not unlikely that many species could cease to exist while human beings survive.</p>

<p><strong>Not backing this theory. Not my personal opinion just putting it out there.</strong></p>

<p>Apparently. People that have debunked this say that the tail of Elenin is actualy composed of particles &quot;thinner&quot; that the smoke of a cigarrete. However the proponents of this theory claim otherwise, they say that there&#39;s some pretty big chunks of rock and ice in the tail. Again. I don&#39;t back the theory or it is my opinion that this scenario will present itself.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t trust NASA. I think they lie just as much as they tell the truth. But that&#39;s another story.</p>

<p>My final point: I think the situation is propense to create a lot of confusion on 11/9 and <strong>I do believe</strong> that dates are important. 11/9 and 11/11 are two dates in which I really believe planned historic events will happen.</p>

<p>There is going to be an Emergency Alert Notification, and an End of Message sent to the broadcasters. However, in order to return to normal broadcasting, an Emergency Alert Termination signal must be sent according to the same regulations. FEMA says this EAT signal will not be sent.  </p>
