    <div class="md"><p>If no trickery or gaming is going on, then I think it&#39;s the Imgur factor that has taken over Reddit as a whole. </p>

<p>People on reddit seem to like quick, easy-to-digest, visual sound bites. Imgur hosted screenshots of typed words get more upvotes than if the writer had submitted them as text. It works. </p>

<p>This subreddit has 42,000+ subscribers, many of them are probably just passively interested and are not going to read long articles, watch long videos, or get into lengthy discussions. </p>

<p>Clicking on a lolcat version of a JFK quote, though, should be right up their alley. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because your initial response to this jfk misquote fiasco is not that people are just lazy and dumb, but that this is evidence of some cabal working against you and the rest of the subreddit. Your thoughts immediately jump to &quot;it must be <em>them</em>&quot; with seemingly no evidence that <em>they</em> exist. At least not in the capacity you might suggest. Actually, this is a good chance to talk about the nature of conspiracy theories. I won&#39;t say all conspiracy theories, but most of them involve observations of human nature that have unnecessary connections drawn between them. It&#39;s not that there literally is a secret cabal of rich fat cats who rule the world and calculate each others every move in their world domination illuminati meetings, but rich people will act like other rich people and all try to stay rich. So it looks like their actions are coordinated when they are actually isolated agents joined by their operating system, that is, human nature. In much the same way, there is a stream of people in this subreddit who generally disagree with everything and can be referred to as &quot;anti-conspiracy&quot;, but where you start to sound paranoid is when you start to insinuate that these people are actually in tangible &quot;cahoots&quot; so to speak. That they actually get together and concoct a plan to defame this subreddit using a coordinated upvote strategy. Come on, man. I mean, you would need to organize a substantial number of people to actually make a dent in any upvote/downvote tally. Not to mention do you really think that people would actually waste time to go through all of this? It&#39;s one thing to have evidence pointing to a conspiracy theory, it&#39;s another to blindly connect unrelated dots. The latter is a symptom of legitimate paranoia which is where my comment came from.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I were in this alleged secret cabal of &quot;anti-conspiracy&quot; redditors this is exactly what I would say. ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just speculated on <em>another</em> possible reason for the high number of upvotes. If you seriously don&#39;t think that there is a large number of people who have contempt for this subreddit, then you must not frequent reddit very often. May I ask, did you upvote the submission knowing that it was a misquote?</p>

<p>You calling me paranoid is ludicrous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t. I used some critical thinking and said to myself &quot;this seems too blatant and literal to be real without there being some widespread conversation about it&quot;. Lo and behold, with google and a bit of critical thought you, too, can avoid looking like an ass!
Because there are a large number of people who have contempt for this subreddit does not immediately prove that they all hatched this calculated diabolical scheme. People just don&#39;t care that much. And of those that do, there aren&#39;t enough of them for there to be an actual conspiracy.
My paranoid comment was merely highlighting the fact that this possibility is <em>highly</em> improbable. A mind would have to be predisposed to paranoid thoughts in order to consider this possibility the most likely answer. There are several explanations that take about a hundredth of the logical assumptions necessary for this one.
You were simply speculating, right? Well, I was just pointing out that the possibility you were speculating was <em>highly</em> unlikely. Which, unless you are indeed a paranoid, you would agree with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I&#39;ll grant the albeit slim possibility of a few people thinking, &quot;If I upvote this and by some chance it makes it to the front page, then r/conspiracy will look dumb for upvoting a misquote!&quot; But by no means do I accept that these alleged saboteurs are numerous enough for us to say &quot;this post made it to the front page because of the anti-conspiracy cabal&quot;. I&#39;m going to put my money on humans being lazy and liking pictures. Especially pictures that may sensationally reinforce their confirmation bias. 
Sorry for the name-calling, that was uncalled for. I just thought it a humorously stereotypical answer for this subreddit. Of course someone in r/conspiracy would offer a conspiracy theory explaining the whole fiasco.</p>

<p>I have been following this for many years. I too have read a similar quote in the past. </p>

<p>JFK when advised of the One World Government plan said: &quot;The high office of president is being used to limit the freedoms of the American people, and before I leave office I must warn the citizens of this plight.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1961 Benjamin Freedman, a loyal American, warned that even then &quot;Zionists ruled the United States like monarchs&quot;. (Note, Mr. Freedman said &quot;Zionists&quot; not &quot;Jews&quot;.) He was personally acquainted with John F. Kennedy who appeared to be the first of a political family dynasty.</p>

<p>Salvador Astucia and Michael Collins Piper are great resources on JFK assassination IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that is the entire story. People believe a thing if it&#39;s plausible to them based on what they already know to be true.</p>

<p>There are good reasons to not trust big banks, the cops, military, spooks, mega corporations, big government, big brother, etc. The reasons can be realized by simply walking out your door and observing society.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really no need to know every fact or facet. Shit&#39;s obviously going down and people are waking up to it. Who really cares if some quote is untrue? It doesn&#39;t contradict what is known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that point of view, but I don&#39;t think that is ultimately what happens in every case or that disinformation is even an important factor for &quot;normals&quot;. I think that it has more to do with who you are when you start out.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve read tons of bullshit and I&#39;m still mostly positive that the world is fucked. As a conspiracy hobbyist myself, I like disinformation. It reminds me to not depend on one source or one point of view. I judge the collective &quot;them&quot; by their actions and what I can plainly see. Unless you&#39;re going to make a court case against them, why try to know every detail?</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#39;s say people know basically &quot;what&#39;s up&quot; (as in, the established institutions are basically <em>against</em> you).</p>

<p>I personally know many people that acknowledge this and they just basically don&#39;t give a shit. They say there&#39;s nothing they can do, so why fret about it? It&#39;s defeatist to me, but to them it&#39;s not because to them they&#39;re not being defeated. They&#39;re fat and happy and they where already going to die anyway :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a long comment on that particular post explaining why it&#39;s fake - and last I checked it had over 250 upvotes.</p>

<p>But most people probably never bothered to see in the comments if the quote had been fabricated - most people just read it and moved on.</p>

<p>Also, and let&#39;s be honest here, conspiracy theorists (of which a large number presumably frequent r/conspiracy) aren&#39;t exactly well known for demanding evidence before believing claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that point of view, but I don&#39;t think that is ultimately what happens in every case or that disinformation is even an important factor for &quot;normals&quot;. I think that it has more to do with who you are when you start out.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve read tons of bullshit and I&#39;m still mostly positive that the world is fucked. As a conspiracy hobbyist myself, I like disinformation. It reminds me to not depend on one source or one point of view. I judge the collective &quot;them&quot; by their actions and what I can plainly see. Unless you&#39;re going to make a court case against them, why try to know every detail?</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#39;s say people know basically &quot;what&#39;s up&quot; (as in, the established institutions are basically <em>against</em> you).</p>

<p>I personally know many people that acknowledge this and they just basically don&#39;t give a shit. They say there&#39;s nothing they can do, so why fret about it? It&#39;s defeatist to me, but to them it&#39;s not because to them they&#39;re not being defeated. They&#39;re fat and happy and they where already going to die anyway :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed with one addition - That&#39;s a real problem for them. It shouldn&#39;t be a problem for you though as a critical thinker. You&#39;re always going to be surrounded by cattle. There&#39;s nothing you can do about that, so it&#39;s not really a problem, it&#39;s more of a condition.</p>
