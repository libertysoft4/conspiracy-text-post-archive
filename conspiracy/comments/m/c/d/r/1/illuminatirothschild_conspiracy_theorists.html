<p><strong>Linking</strong> directly to a claim is now equated with &quot;parroting&quot; by the notorious troll, RogerStrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy is asking Illuminati/Rothschild Conspiracy Theorists to convince him that their claim is true.  You offer up the claim with no evidence whatsoever, from someone else who was merely repeating it with no evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no sign that any thought was involved in the process; not even a realization that simply repeating the claim does not constitute evidence.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s what everyone expects from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I offered up links to previous discussion.</p>

<p>If you had read the link in context, you would have seen the comment above it was edited. It originally contained a citation link (now removed) which the list was based upon (I know this because I read it before the edit). So, again, perhaps you should direct your tantrum at the author(s) of the comment(s) I linked to. It&#39;s not like they died or got abducted by aliens.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, do you masturbate to violent rape fantasies while posting this hostile drivel?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is: I posted a couple of links, and you got a serious hate boner going. You might want to see a therapist about that shit, bro.</p>
