    <div class="md"><p>I would just like to point out that Guy Fawkes (the man behind the mask that Anonymous uses) wasn&#39;t trying to destroy an evil theocracy - he was trying to <em>install</em> one. Fawkes was a fighter for Spain and the Catholic Church. His goal was to end the slightly more egalitarian Protestant revolution in England by restoring Catholic domination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Read the comic. V is an anarchist, and it&#39;s a bit more ambiguous instead of the black and white good/evil of the movie. It also had more to do with Thatcherism in the UK instead of the updated US neoconservatism of the movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are the new terrorists... their actions will eventually be used to justify an internet crackdown, and probably a lot more.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember where I heard it, and I can&#39;t say if it is true, but someone wrote somewhere that one in four hackers is an informant for the FBI. It makes sense that there would be at least some truth to this... the internet is becoming a field of battle; it is under surveillance and the government uses viruses to disable its enemies. </p>

<p>Anonymous just seems a little too perfect in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be totally on board with this viewpoint. Short of calling them idiots. In my experience on this subreddit I&#39;ve found people to be generally pretty accepting. This sort of dismissive attitude is part of the problem.</p>

<p>I am concerned that the propagation of this negative, &#39;we&#39;re screwed&#39; mentally only serves as a self-fufiling prophecy or an excuse not to act. I&#39;m also concerned such &#39;fear the NWO one world government&#39; may be a distraction or cointellpro at work. Hearts and minds you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just like any other social group, just in this case it&#39;s a group of internet people with an interest in the internet and security, who do use and probably always have used IRC.</p>

<p>People come and go, and as with any group of people without any particular leader, the whims and targets tend to trend towards whatever gets attention within everyone who is vaguely interested and connected.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to find, not hard to become a part of, and not hard to support or not support a particular current issue. It&#39;s just an method for organising a group of internet people to fight for or against a cause and sometimes you can get enough people interested to actually make a difference.</p>

<p>It does get a bit cliqey sometimes - even though you don&#39;t know the people&#39;s real names or locations that you&#39;re talking to, chatting to a group of people regularly can give you the feeling that you are getting to know them, and alliances form and collapse like in every other social network.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a bunch of people who want to make a difference when they feel like they can, how they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange&#39;s mother was associated with an Australian mind-control cult that raised children without names, interchangeable identities, sex abuse, hallucinogens, and ... dyed platinum blonde hair.</p>

<p>Assange alleges that he was not raised in this cult, but that he and his mother spent years on the run as fugitives from the cult.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence says otherwise.</p>

<p>Assange also has plenty of strange collaborators, backers, and associates:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who really cares when the vast majority of their message is truthful, and as far as I am concerned, based on fact?  The organizational nature of Anonymous allows more people to view/hear about issues of significance to the daily lives of peons like myself (banking cartels, war for central asia and mideast, corruption).  Besides, how often do you hear Anonymous&#39; statements in the newsmedia...rather, when Anon is mentioned in the newsmedia, it glosses over the substance of reasoning for the group carrying out their hacks.</p>

<p>We are at a moment where the population of aware people is growing rapidly, and any medium through which awareness can be spread is a good thing.  The only real threat if Anon were blackops, is if it were to carry out an attack that killed or affected the lives of many in the Western world...then it could potentially serve the purpose of discrediting the counter-cultural movement...kinda like how the Black Panthers discredited equal rights protests in America for a while.</p>
