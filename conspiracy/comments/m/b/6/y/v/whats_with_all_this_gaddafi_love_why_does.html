        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is it annoying anyone else that ANY time there is ANY event going on in the world, 90% of this subreddit simply refuses the simple answer in favour of an overly complicated theory?</p>

<p>All of a sudden most of this subreddit seems to think Gaddafi was some sort of saint killed by the US for trying to expose secrets or some stupid shit. I&#39;ve seen questions asking for proof that he was brutal and unfair, others saying he didn&#39;t deserve to be removed and it was a conspiracy for oil or some stupid shit</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asked for proof that his troops shot on protesters. DO YOU PEOPLE NOT KEEP UP WITH ANY NEWS?</p>

<p>These are civilian uploads to youtube. And for some reason everything the press says has to be 100% made up according to this subreddit, so I won&#39;t post any news reports detailing civilian executions. Don&#39;t forget the warehouse where they found protestors and fighters massacred. Lets just throw all his broadcasts saying to kill the rebels like rats and that they would not spare a single one. I&#39;m also sure that the media just made up the fact that he was in power for over 30 FUCKING YEARS</p>

<p>No, suddenly this subreddit fucking loves this man. Suddenly he was a saint, was fair to his people and EVERYONE who has replied to my comments demands proof that he was an unfair dictator.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, r/conspiracy. You are all smarter than me and everyone else and the &quot;mainstream media&quot; because you&#39;re in on this great conspiracy and you know that Gaddafi was a great person</p>

<p>ಠ_ಠ</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>I know most of this subreddit would look for a tldr since that is what most of you do when looking for &quot;facts&quot;. Either read the whole thing or don&#39;t comment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notorious 1994, you state that those that opposed the removal of Gaddafi did so because we believe there was&quot; a conspiracy for oil or some stupid shit.&quot; The reasons for my objections are somewhat deeper than &quot;oil or some stupid shit.&quot; The main reason Gadaffi was deposed and murdered is that he had plans tointroduce the gold dinar, a single African currency that would serve as an alternative to the U.S. dollar and allow African nations to share the wealth. The Dinar would have been backed 100% by gold, thus destroying the dollar&#39;s usability and credibility in Africa and the Middle East.  It is surely no coincidence that Iraq’s prior leader, Saddam Hussein, was trying to do the same thing just prior to U.S. invasion for all of those “weapons of mass destruction.”</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch ranked Libya at 58 on it latest world report. When referring to this ranking by HRW one must keep in mind that a higher number is a better number. Notorious 1994, would you care to guess who has the dubious distinction of being number 1? If you guessed the United States of America, you&#39;d be correct. In fact, of all the nations in Africa, Libya outranked EVERY single other nation on the continent.  Also, the United Nations was preparing to bestow an award on the &quot;brutal dictator&quot; Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, and the Libyan Jamahiriya, for its achievements in the area of human rights. Lastly, Libya was a member of the  UN Human Rights panel.</p>

<p>Notorious 1994, since you seem to be a fan of visual aids, I offer the following. This video shows what was reported by several news agencies to be over 1 million Libyans gathered in SUPPORT of Gadaffi. That would be 1 million out of a nation of 6 million <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWzNhk3zv4U&amp;amp;feature=related">Libyans.</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s not a lot of oil in Bosnia or Kosovo or Afghanistan.  The Somali pirates don&#39;t have much either.</p>

<p>NATO countries had no problem buying oil from Gaddafi.  the new regime will still be part of OPEC.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that the MSM has been feeding us all a load of horse shit, but that&#39;s not the same thing as loving Gaddafi.</p>

<p>Stop it with the nonsensical attacks.</p>

<p>There are very good reasons for Gaddafi to be attacked, and they&#39;re much the same reasons as for Saddam to be attacked.</p>
