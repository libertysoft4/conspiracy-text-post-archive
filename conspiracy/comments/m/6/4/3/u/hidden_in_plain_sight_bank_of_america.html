Their name is Bank OF America of meaning ownership of all moneys in America. By controlling the takedown of the 99 percent (being average working class with mortgages and bills), they have controlled the credit scores of millions by forcing people and small businesses into foreclosure. It is a vicious cycle and sooner or later the truth will come out.

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what pisses me off about conspiracies. There are some i believe, and alot i think are just plain batshit insane. when i speak out against them, i am the one that&#39;s working for the government/illumnati/aliens.</p>

<p>seriously, what kind of community support is that shit? makes me less likely to believe in a conspiracy i don&#39;t believe in, but maybe its just the go-to thing they say when they run out of answers/have no evidence. kind of like christians that say &quot;god works in mysterious ways&quot;</p>

<p>anyways, i know you are making fun of it, but figured i would rant. feels good, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i understand what your saying, but a bank (which sucks) is named bank of america.. that is not a conspiracy.  its simple.. theres corruption and fraud inside of the company.  but a corporation that is already outed as being a shitty corporate monger being NAMED bank of america.  you&#39;re simply not opening peoples eyes.. you&#39;re throwing out desperate stretches.   i promote open discussion of conspiracy and im obviously subscribed to this page in which i support.  but yours was shitty.. give me a downvote.. but if you do.. i bet you&#39;re the government and doing it so ill never get heard!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me like that divide comes from the fact that if you simply state you do not believe in a particular theory, the people that do will mob up and try to force it down your throats. i personally would just rather them to shut the hell up than try to force it down my throat.</p>

<p>there are on occasion people (like the guy who made this thread) that does not seem concerned about forcing things down peoples throats.</p>

<p>Also, people that have obviously done no research coming up with their theories (nibaru is a good example) they have taken almost no time to research the subject, except from what their friends told them. They will sit and deny cold, hard facts. those guys reeallly irritate me the most, and seem to be the most prevalent here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, sadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh like the native Americans loved it before the settlers came in and introduced war and smallpox, is that when people loved America? I guess I&#39;m confused. My post is about a play on words and it relating to current events of Bank of America being cited for fraud. The founder was the child of Italian immigrants who started the bank based on his other bank Bank of Italy. But it is appropriately named Bank OF America because it is the center of all financial crisis in America&#39;s working class. And it being named the bank of America with America being in such financial straits it seems appropriately named.</p>

Many Americans still love America because they are ignorant or miseducated. You are confused. You are using <em>your</em> present day recognition of American reality and attributing an evil or malicious intent to the name of the bank. You are also, in my opinion, way off the mark with regard to it being <em>&quot;the center of all financial crisis in America&#39;s working class&quot;.</em> I think you might want to consider the Federal Reserve Bank the real culprit.

<p>Again, this is a question loaded with distinction between ideals and historical (ugly) facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just noticed your user ID.</p>

<p>You originally posted something about the name of a bank that did not make sense to me. The name is a vestige of a time when nationalism was fervent and not a means of covertly stating some nefarious intent. Through all its incarnations the name was kept because it works to the banks advantage. The failings of America or of banking or of this particular bank were not part of the naming process.</p>

<p>Get some 100% Indica and one of <em><a href="http://www.wickiepipe.com/Incredibowl_m420_Red_p/m420red.htm">these.</a></em></p>

<p>Now you make sense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now you don&#39;t, for two reasons: 1) Indica is sleep-inducing, Sativa is what I&#39;d prefer, and 2) I can&#39;t even afford US Government sprayed Mexican shwag, let alone 100% anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what pisses me off about conspiracies. There are some i believe, and alot i think are just plain batshit insane. when i speak out against them, i am the one that&#39;s working for the government/illumnati/aliens.</p>

<p>seriously, what kind of community support is that shit? makes me less likely to believe in a conspiracy i don&#39;t believe in, but maybe its just the go-to thing they say when they run out of answers/have no evidence. kind of like christians that say &quot;god works in mysterious ways&quot;</p>

<p>anyways, i know you are making fun of it, but figured i would rant. feels good, man.</p>
