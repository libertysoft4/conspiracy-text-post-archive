<p>Not so much. A written article covered the story in more depth.  She failed inspection. The food was not at safe temperatures. She was not licensed.  She could not provide the provenance of the food.</p>

<p>The woman was warned in advance. She decided to ignore the official&#39;s warning and continue. </p>

<p>She charged for the food.  This put her under state law.</p>

<p>Why do you think so many warm countries have spicy food? It&#39;s to hide the taste of it going bad.</p>

<p>You cannot judge the safety of food just by taste.</p>

<p>They are more than welcome to, they just can&#39;t charge for the food. She chose to pour bleach on it herself or face charges. </p>

<p>Actually, no.  I seem to recall quite a few cases where inspection of food has saved lives.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked in a few resteraunts before.  I never eat anywhere I can&#39;t see into the kitchen. If not for the constant threat of inspections, there would be a lot more filthy commercial kitchens.</p>

<p>Your opinion is noted.  Should the authorities just track people getting food poisoning instead of preemptively ensuring the food is handled and prepared in safe manner?</p>

<p>Not so much.  She could have refused and been charged with some very pricey charges. They did not twist her arm around her back and force her to do it.</p>

<p>Not so much.  I know a lot of cooks that can prepare meat that I wouldn&#39;t touch in a way that it tastes good.</p>

<p>Food does not have to be rotten to get you sick.  It just has to be growing some of the right type of bacteria. You will likely never taste the bacteria that get you sick, only their byproducts if the food is truly rotten.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How many is too many people getting sick? 1, 2, 20? A percentage?  If only a few people that eat one particular dish get sick, you may never hear of it. </p>

<p>Newspapers will only report it if the health inspectors shut the place down. As you are against food inspection, it seems that in your ideal world, a diner could stay open until so many people actually got sick of it.  </p>

<p>Tests are only run if people get sick.  They are kind of expensive to run on a day to day basis.  This is why so much attention is paid to cleanliness and methodology of food preparation.</p>

<p>You kind of gloss over the inspection part of being licensed.  </p>

<p>If the kitchen is clean, the food is being handled properly and within date, and the owner can show receipts to show where he got it, it is assumed to be good unless people start getting sick. </p>

<p>It&#39;s far better to shut the place down before people start getting sick than to try catching one bad dish out of thousands or shutting the place down after people start getting sick.</p>

<p>Then you start getting into the licensing of the cooks if required in the area. That means PPDs, a physical and some passing some tests.</p>

<p>How do I know that it&#39;s not filthy? What if I&#39;m on the road and need to grab a bite to eat out of town?  What if the thermostat to their fridge is not keeping the food cold enough? Should I trust my life and intestines to random chance?</p>

<p>For the most part, food laws and regulations where not blindly thrown together.  Usually they were created/changed/modified after an investigation where people got sick or died. The overwhelming majority of them are common sense and should not be an issue for any good eatery.</p>

<p>While I am as anti government control as a lot of the other posters in this reddit, I am not an anarchist. This is one of the jobs government should do.  This is truly in the realm of public safety.</p>

<p>If you are strongly arguing against the state/municipality being involved in trying to ensure food safety in commercial dining facilities and you do not even understand what it entails, you are not following reason.</p>

<p>Actually no.  Highly transient workforce and lower than average education levels.  The resteraunt industry has shown repeatedly that it cannot be trusted to police itself.</p>

<p>Tests are only run if people get sick. They are kind of expensive to run on a day to day basis. This is why so much attention is paid to cleanliness and methodology of food preparation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh, so people depend on the government for food safety, and then the government only tests food after the fact, eh?  sounds 100% unreliable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides, would you trust a place that can&#39;t even keep their floors clean to test food? You&#39;re asking a lot of a cook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>maybe you shouldn&#39;t eat at a restaurant that&#39;s filthy.  maybe our society should be smart enough to avoid that kind of problem.  maybe we shouldn&#39;t solve this problem by blindly throwing laws at it.</p>
