<p>Just dropped off some packages at UPS and the clerk tried to scan my driver&#39;s license, saying it was policy.  He also said I was the first customer to complain.</p>

<p>I am going to tape over the bar code on my license so it can&#39;t be scanned without some effort.</p>

<p>But this is getting ridiculous.  Fortunately, in both cases, I was able to complete my transaction without the scan, but it took standing up to these &quot;policies.&quot;  (UPS wasn&#39;t able to show me a written policy.)</p>

<p>Why does &quot;the state&quot; need to have a scan of my DL associated with my every move now??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be absolutely floored and shocked to the core if anyone can back this up with a law or even a court precedent.</p>

<p>Yeah, you need I&#39;d to drive and fly and shit. You sure as fucking hell cannot be compelled to produce Id &#39;cause it&#39;s the law&#39;. Anyone who says otherwise probably got bullied by a cop into thinking it is the law. I seriously can&#39;t count the number of times I have told police that I will not give them my id. Sometimes they try and strong arm you, sometimes they don&#39;t. One tried forcing me to give him my wallet cause he &#39;knnew I had one&#39;. I told him I would not.</p>

<p>Sometimes I will give my name if I don&#39;t want a big hassle, but unless I&#39;m behind a wheel or buying alcohol you are not going to get it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same as photographing police - they&#39;ll maintain it&#39;s illegal and farm up charges on you but if you stand firm you&#39;ll learn it&#39;s a farce.  As with most &#39;rights&#39;, you must stand for them.  If you do have identification and you fail to produce it (on request), they can charge you.  As mentioned, the best response is &quot;am I being detained or under arrest&quot; - if you are then hand it over.  If you are being detained or arrested, a report must be filed and the officer must get creative for the reason (which is becoming even easier for them).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely correct.  The willing acceptance of anything similar to the OP&#39;s story is outrageous.  I have never encountered such a situation so I cannot personally comment.</p>

<p>That being said, the aforementioned acceptance occurs in other areas in which I have encountered.  PEOPLE DON&#39;T CARE IF IT DOESN&#39;T CAUSE THEM HARM.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t care if they&#39;re carded or searched for something because they have nothing to hide, or some stupid response that is constantly reinforced by the media, society, entertainment etc.</p>

<p>I was taught to actually believe in human rights, civil rights, rights guaranteed to me as a citizen, et cetera and I feel like I either missed a lesson where those things only apply to certain people, or under certain circumstances, or should be surrendered when asked.</p>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me? Fucking fuck shit I wish there was a cuss word worse than fuck.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re right oasiss.  A friend said they thought it was cool and funny when they were nudey scanned by the TSA because it felt like a video game.  I asked why they thought it was ok, why they liked it and why they didn&#39;t care about their rights.</p>

<p>Answer?  Safety and it didn&#39;t hurt them.</p>

<p>To so carelessly toss away things that should be granted to every person on this earth......ugh.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still convinced the only legitimate alteration to airline travel was adding a cockpit door that is only able to be opened from the inside.  The rest is TOTAL bullshit. The rest is slowly sapping you, from you, for lack of a better way to put it.  Please don&#39;t fall for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was simply stating that payment of cash does not remove the requirement (by Target) to scan my DL.  I wasn&#39;t buying a tobacco product, but rather an age restricted item from Target.  Why an eyeball of my DL wasn&#39;t sufficient is puzzling.  I have an easier time buying a bottle of Jack Daniels from the liqueur store, or getting into a bar.  </p>

<p>Now, if only my birth date was captured when my DL is scanned, okay, but that&#39;s not the case.  My license contains name, address, phone number, date-of-birth, eye color, hair color, weight, driving restrictions, organ donar status, and driver&#39;s license number.  And in some cases, my SS#.  That&#39;s a lot of information to provide to purchase nicotine gum, or a pack of cigarettes.  At Target, it goes beyond those items as well.  Video games are included, as well as other seemingly random items.</p>

<p>Now, whether I or someone else has any evidence that a merchant or advertiser would sell/purchase this information, or not, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a non-issue.  Once my DL is scanned, all of that personal information is then in the hands of the merchant, and not in my control.  In my case, it&#39;s stored and maintained by Target, and Target is a big company.  </p>

<p>How do I know what Target is or isn&#39;t doing with my personal information?  I wasn&#39;t provided any official Fair Information Practices policy from Target, nor was I informed of any sort of Privacy Policy.  I was just required to provide my personal information.  That&#39;s an issue.</p>

<p>How do I know that Target will protect my data?  Do you think a company like Target can&#39;t be part of a targeted cyber attack, where personal information is stolen?  All I wanted to do was buy some gum, but my personal information could potentially end up in the black market in the hands of criminals.  That&#39;s an issue</p>

<p>If Target can&#39;t trust there own trained point of sale employees to read a DL and determine the age of someone, why should I trust that they can safely and responsibly maintain my personal information?</p>
