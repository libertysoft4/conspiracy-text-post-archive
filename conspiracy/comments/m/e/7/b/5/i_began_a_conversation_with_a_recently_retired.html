In our conversation the man began to talk about a recent conversation he had with a politician named John, region is Fl. In this talk he said to the man if we ended operation grace land our military spending would reduce greatly. The politician responded &quot;i didnt hear you say that, dont talk about that again.&quot; With great curosity I asked him what it was. He went on to tell me that there are 30 prisons scattered in random countries across the world. (After getting home the only thing i researched close to it is black sites that Bush said we had.) The thing that threw me off though is the next part. He responded next with &quot;they are run by boeing, they make airplanes, what business do they have with prisons!&quot; The man began to chuckle at his last remark and go about his way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust me, a LOT of people in this country &quot;worked&quot; in intelligence. The ones I have met that actually have would not give up one word about their activities. </p>

<p>You are applying meaning to the politician&#39;s statement that is not supported. If there are secret prisons, operated by Boeing, supported by the US military budget, scattered around random countries across the world, why would a politician in FL know about it --and if he did, why would he respond in such a leading manner?? Additionally, why would the government spend so much money (he mentioned eliminating Op Grace Land would reduce spending greatly) to help Boeing secure slave labor to build their planes? There are plenty of overt ways for the military to waste tax dollars and make Boeing rich without the risk and uncertainty of operating secret slave labor factories in foreign countries.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone can keep a secret and it does make an excellent conversation piece. What do you mean i implied meaning to the politicians statement? I live in Fl and had this conversation in Fl. So i could only assume thats where he talked to the politician and thought maybe reddit could narrow it down to who possibly the man could be. Sure there are probably a lot of johns in politics but mentioning a specific region would narrow it down a little.</p>

<p>I do see your point on the second half! I share some of these doubts and reasoning as well, which is why i posted it to r/conspiracy and in this post light has already been shed on the subject more than i previously could acknowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant you were implying that the politician&#39;s response somehow gave some validity to your friend&#39;s question about operation grace land, but we have no evidence of that. He may have been confused or bluffing because he thought he SHOULD know. He may have just been tired of conspiracy theorists wasting his time with such ideas, or tired of constituents trying to oversimplify complex budget issues by fixating one random program. </p>
