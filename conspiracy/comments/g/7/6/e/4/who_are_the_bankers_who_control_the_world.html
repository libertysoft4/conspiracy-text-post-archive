There is one individual person or entity that is probably unknown, that the whole world is indebted to.  There must be one source to all the funds provided to nations and governments and organizations, that everyone who borrows from one another must originally borrow from to lend out.  Am I wrong on this?  I&#39;ve read all about the Rothschilds, and they seem the obvious answer if my view is correct.  But nothing I&#39;ve read about them ever goes extreme enough to say that they are the top level, and all of the world&#39;s money is debt to them....Is it possible that there is a level of wealth even greater that theirs?  If I am wrong in my assumption that there must be one common lender at the top, and all other debt is under the top lender, please explain why.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Jews&quot; <a href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm">(see this for what I mean by this)</a> control the money in the world through the use of ursury or interest. For example, Jews were prominent in England after the norman conquest. Communities of jews where established in 1656 but there is evidence of jewish money lending in chapter 10 of the magna carta written in 1215.  </p>

<p>Jews were particularly involved in money lending because Christian teachings on usury did not apply to them and also the Jews were persecuted from doing any other type of work.  i.e. they had to lend to christians in order to survive.</p>

<p>Why is this history lesson relevant to the OP&#39;s question?</p>

<p>Well, just $1 lent to an individual in the year 1215 compounded over 796 years at 5% interest payable monthly would equate to a staggering $177,422,970,396,288,700 which is:<br/>
177 Quadrillion, 422 Trillion, 970 billion, 396 Million, 288 Thousand and 700 Dollars</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm">calculator i used</a> </p>

<p>The truth is, the amount of money out there is secret swiss and luxembourg accounts is probably far more than this. </p>

<p>Why do they need this money?</p>

<p>&quot;To maintain order&quot; which some people will argue <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6907681.ece">is the work of God</a>  but you have to ask yourself &quot;Who&#39;s god is it?&quot;  </p>

<p>The Book of Revelation, Chapter 2, Verse 9, states the following which would appear to be about Ashkenazi Jews (90% of jewish people today originating from Georgia (genetically speaking):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I know thy works, and tribulation and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an excerpt from an <a href="http://www.rense.com/general79/tril.htm">article I was just reading</a>:</p>

<p>A recent article in the London Financial Times indicates  why it is impossible to gain an accurate estimate of the  wealth of the trillionaire bankers. Discussing the sale  of Evelyn Rothschild&#39;s stake in Rothschild Continuation  Holdings, it states: ...[this] requires agreement on the  valuation of privately held assets whose value has never  been tested in a public market. Most of these assets are  held in a complex network of tax-efficient structures  around the World. </p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s shareholdings remain hidden behind  Bank of England Nominee accounts. The Guardian newspaper  reported in May 2002 ... &quot;the reason for the wild  variations in valuations of her private wealth can be  pinned on the secrecy over her portfolio of share  investments. This is because her subjects have no way of  knowing through a public register of interests where she,  as their head of state, chooses to invest her money. Unlike  the members of the Commons and now the Lords, the Queen  does not have to annually declare her interests and as a  result her subjects cannot question her or know about  potential conflicts of interests...&quot; In fact, the Queen  even has an extra mechanism to ensure that her investments  remain secret - a nominee company called the Bank of  England Nominees. It has been available for decades to the  entire World&#39;s current heads of state to allow them  anonymity when buying shares. Therefore, when a company  publishes a share register and the Bank of England Nominees  is listed, it is not possible to gauge whether the Queen,  President Bush or even Saddam Hussein is the true  shareholder. </p>

<p>By this method, the trillionaire masters of the universe  remain hidden whilst Forbes magazine poses lower ranking  billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett as the  richest men in the World. Retired management consultant  Gaylon Ross Sr, author of Who&#39;s Who of the Global Elite,  has been tipped from a private source that the combined  wealth of the Rockefeller family in 1998 was approx (US)  $11 trillion and the Rothschilds (U.S.) $100 trillion.</p>
