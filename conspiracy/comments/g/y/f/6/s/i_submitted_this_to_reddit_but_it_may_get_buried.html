        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I put a lot of time and thought into this post, so please try to discuss it seriously. </p>

<p>I know that 80-90% of sightings are misidentified aircraft, Skunkworks, balloons,etc. *<em>However</em>, the reason I believe there is something more to those ~10% of sightings, is because of the credible witnesses, the experts, military witnesses, and those who have done serious research on the subject. Whether or not they are Extraterrestrial, from another dimension, or something else entirely. </p>

<p>I <strong>DO NOT</strong> believe in alien abductions, the faker of the moon landing, bigfoot, Nessie, or anything like that. I really do welcome a discussion on this subject. Reddit is filled with intelligent individuals, I just think that some of you are a bit unfair, sometimes even arrogant, in your complete dismissal of the subject. I have seen a lot of Redditors &quot;debunk&quot; the entire subject without even having <em>seriously</em> looked into it. That, I believe, goes against what Science is all about.
Here is a short list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Major General Wilfried De Brouwer (Ret.), who was in charge of the Belgian Air Force investigation into that country&#39;s UFO wave in 1989. He spent 20 years as a fighter pilot in the Belgian Air Force, before being appointed to the Strategic Planning Branch of NATO in 1983, while a Colonel.</p></li>
<li><p>Four-star Brigadier General Jose Carlos Pereira (Ret.), a commander of the Brazilian Airspace Defense Command from 1999 to 2001. He was involved in an incident on the night of May 19, 1986. An array of UFOs were spotted over southeastern Brazil, and the entire defense system was put on alert. The Air Force scrambled its most experienced pilots in F-5 and F-103 jets to intercept the objects. At the same time, Colonel Ozires Silva, president of the Brazilian oil company, and his pilot, Commander Alcir Pereira de Silva, were flying an executive Xingu jet near Pocos de Caldas, heading to Sao Jose dos Campos, when radars in different locations showed <strong>twenty-one</strong> UFOs in the sky from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro. Silva and his pilot chased one of them for thirty minutes. They described it as a fast-moving, bright red-orange light that appeared to jump from point to point. They were not able to gain on it, so they abandoned their pursuit. <strong>Numerous expert witnesses saw something and radar detected the same thing.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Former Canadian Defense Minister Paul Heller.</p></li>
<li><p>Former President Jimmy Carter not only saw a UFO, he reported it.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Michio Dr. Kaku says about the 5% of &quot;spooky&quot; and unexplainable UFO sightings: &quot;We&#39;re talking about generals, we&#39;re talking about airforce pilots, we&#39;re talking about governors of states, that claim, &#39;Hey, this is beyond our understanding of the laws of physics.&quot; (speaking about Leslie Kean&#39;s book <em>UFOs</em>, which is a wonderfully researched, sober, and objective look at the study of the UFO phenomenon.</p></li>
<li><p>Johm Callahan, former head of the FAA&#39;s Accidents and Investigations Division. He has over 30 years of experience at the FAA. During that time, he investigated an extraordinary event and was told that he was not allowed to talk about it. The event in question was the encounter with a UFO that Japan Air Lines flight 1628 had. It was a cargo jet with a pilot, a copilot, and a flight engineer. There were evasive maneuvers, but the UFO followed the 747, which was estimated by the pilot to be at least the size of an aircraft carrier(the pilot had it on radar, which has range marks). The printout and radar playback later corroborated their story.</p></li>
<li><p>Fife Symington III, former governor of Arizona, who at first dismissed the so-called Phoenix Lights when he was Governor, but later admitted that he was given the run-around by numerous U.S. agencies. If you&#39;ve ever researched the Phoenix Lights in detail, the &quot;Flare&quot; story that the Air Force put out strains credibility, especially since they originally denied having anything in the air at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Fun Fact: The Government of Brazil were responsible for releasing the Trindade photographs, which are among the best, most valuable photos regarding UFOs ever taken. You will <a href="http://imgur.com/a/3xMB8#hi6qB">recognize</a> when you see them. The Brazilian Navy Ministry endorsed these photographs, as did Admiral Antonio Alves Camara. The original photos and negatives were analyzed by both the Navy Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory and the private Cruzeiro do Sul Aerophotogrammetric Service, both confirming their authenticity.</p></li>
<li><p>Former Iranian Air Force Major Parviz Jafari, who is now a retired general, who encountered a brilliant, diamond-shaped UFO in his F-4 Phantom jet.</p></li>
<li><p>Peruvian Air Force pilot Oscar Santa Maria, who encountered, and was ordered to open fire upon, a UFO in his Sukhoi-22 fighter jet.</p></li>
<li><p>Denis Letty, chairman of the COMETA group, a French group that organized the amazing COMETA report on UFOs. He is a well-known former fighter pilot who was head of the French Air Defense, southeast zone, and the French military mission for the Allied Air Force of Central Europe. <strong>The COMETA report was groundbreaking, being the first time in any country that a group of this size and stature had declared that UFOs-solid but as yet unexplained objects in the sky-constitute a real phenomenon warranting immediate international attention.</strong> The COMETA authors were 13 retired generals, scientists, and space experts who spent 3 years analyzing military and pilot encounters with UFOs. Their conclusion was that about 5% of sightings-those for which there is enough solid documentation to eliminate other possibilities-cannot be easily attributed to earthly sources, such as secret military exercises or natural phenomena. This 5% seem to be &quot;completely unknown flying machines with exceptional performances that are guided by a natural or artificial intelligence.&quot;  They concluded that the &quot;extraterrestrial hypothesis&quot; was the most logical explanation.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. James Harder, a University of California professor of civil engineering, who told the House Science and Astronautics Committee in 1968: &quot;On the basis of the data and ordinary rules of evidence, as would be applied in civil or criminal courts, the physical reality of UFOs has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; Also, that UFOs have demonstrated &quot;scientific secrets we do not know ourselves.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Sergeant James Penniston (Ret.), Colonel Charles I. Halt (Ret.), both of the United States Air Force, both involved in the Rendlesham Forest incident, where they saw a UFO, even claimed to have touched it.</p></li>
<li><p>General Ricardo Bermudez Sanhueza (Ret.), Chilean Air Force, and Captain Rodrigo Bravo Garrido, Aviation Army of Chile.</p></li>
<li><p>The governments of France, Chile, Peru, and the UK, all of whom have set up organizations to study the UFO phenomena. GEIPAN of France, CEFAA of Chile, OIFFA of Peru, and the Ministry of Defence in the UK put Nick Pope in charge of theirs.</p></li>
<li><p>Captain Ray Bowyer and his passengers observed a pair of brilliant UFOs over the English Channel in 2007.</p></li>
<li><p>Edgar Dean Mitchell, D.Sc., an American pilot, engineer, and astronaut. As the lunar module pilot of Apollo 14, he spent nine hours working on the lunar surface in the Fra Mauro Highlands region, making him the sixth person to walk on the Moon.(from Wikipedia)  Mitchell has publicly expressed his opinions that he is &quot;90 percent sure that many of the thousands of unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, recorded since the 1940s, belong to visitors from other planets&quot;[5] and that UFOs have been the &quot;subject of disinformation in order to deflect attention and to create confusion so the truth doesn&#39;t come out&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One of the most interesting individuals</strong>, Commander Will Miller, United States Navy (Ret.), who was awarded the Department of Defense Meritorious Service Medal, he is a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, was a senior Department of Defense command center operations action officer, a senior intelligence analyst, and a program manager for DoD future operations programs such as WWIII planning, nonlethal weapons systems, and future space systems. He was an advisor to U.S. Space Command and U.S. Southern Command and its international counterdrug operations, Joint Interagency Task Force East, and, as an expert in special contingency operations, Miller held a Top Secret clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information access, meaning he had access to sensitive information whose handling is restricted one step further than the Top Secret classification, including that which is related to topics and programs not publicly acknowledged. <strong>This man has had UFO sightings, and has studied them for the better part of his life.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am sorry if the list was long. Honestly, I could keep going. There are hundreds more military officers, grunts, pilots, politicians(I know), scientists, etc. Thank you for your time, Reddit.</p>

<p><strong>If this doesn&#39;t get downvoted into oblivion, and there are some people interested, I will provide links and pictures to everything(for those who don&#39;t want to spend the time Googling).</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT: WOW! You guys are awesome! I never see UFO threads make it even close to the front page! I am enjoying the discussions! Thank you for the thoughtful dialogue. I will be around all day(day off)!! I hope there are more to come.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, sir! Quite a few countries have just recently come to the conclusion that there is something here to be studied. I cannot say whether they are just recently <em>admitting</em> it, or if their scientific interest is indeed genuinely recent. I <strong>highly</strong> recommend Leslie Kean&#39;s new book on the subject. It is an incredibly well-researched book that takes a mostly obective look at the evidence, as told by military, credible civilian, and expert witnesses. She has a lot of them write essays, which she includes in the book. <a href="http://ufosontherecord.com/">Here</a> is her website for the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, with the seemingly increasing public interest in this subject, as well as the non sourced hearsay, I&#39;d say disclosure is probably soon, one way or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why disclose anything?  The US government would then have to justify the secrecy to a public already growing very distrustful.</p>

<p>No, if the UFO phenomenon represents E.T. trying to make contact then it will be done on E.T.&#39;s terms and unequivocally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the true problem with disclosure is showing our security weaknesses and after the public settles down, the next conversation in our toxic political scene is how are you planning on protecting us. Our government would be forced to show at least a little bit of what we have in our arsenal that the public doesn&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>Disclosure itself would be fantastic, what happens afterwards would not be. We really do have a lot of crazy people in our country willing to fight tooth and nail over a birth certificate. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s right, but I don&#39;t know that it is a good idea right now given the state of the world.</p>

<p>What good would disclosure do other than satisfy curiosity? The negative outweighs the pros. If they are a threat then you had better believe our military industrial complex is working feverishly to cash those black budget checks to develop weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analogy isn&#39;t quite apt. The person who tells your boss is disclosing information they have found.</p>

<p>If you and your coworker together represent departments or groups or individuals in government, and your boss represents the public, and one of you is disclosing things that the other did, then that would be government disclosing secrets that government kept.</p>

<p>Imagine that your mind is a mixture of beliefs and opinions that sometimes conflict. Imagine that you stole something from your aunt. Part of you is happy to have stolen it. Perhaps another part is scared of punishment. And perhaps another part of you feels guilty. Or perhaps part of you is scared of getting in worse trouble if you keep lying about it but get caught later on. If you disclose what you did after a little bit of time, and say that it was when you were younger and less mature and governed by a different set of beliefs, then you can get that guilt off your chest and hopefully only get a slap on the wrist and a thank you for having the courage to be honest now.</p>

<p>Sadly, people think &quot;UFO&quot; means &quot;extra terrestrial flying saucer&quot; instead &quot;flying thing I don&#39;t recognize&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  There are three explanations for this hypothesis that makes the most sense of the data:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>That some UFO encounters represent structured, intelligently controlled craft which exhibit flight characteristics impossible with mainstream scientists&#39; understanding of physics and applied science.  These craft are created secretly without the public&#39;s knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>See number 1 but change the source from terrestrial to extraterrestrial.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, there is always the possibility of a combination of 1 and 2.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>And naturally that some UFO sightings are not craft at all. Could be misidentified objects of known origin, could be life forms, could be odd electromagnetic phenomena, could be holograms, could be ghosts or spirits, etc.</p>

<p>However, some are very likely #3.</p>

<p>My summary -  UFO&#39;s are 3 things.   </p>

<p>1 Black Op Secret Technology acquired through N. Tesla and contact
2 Extra Dimensional Beings
3 What you&#39;d expect, aliens from space </p>

<p>Anybody into conspiracy theories knows there is some sort of &quot;agenda&quot; going on that is perpetuating towards a world government.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget time travelers.  And that doesn&#39;t even have to mean from the future, could easily be from the past.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this: there won&#39;t be consensus on this until the aliens/travelers want there to be.  And for now, it&#39;s pretty obvious they don&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>Look at the Hubble deep field imagery.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, that makes the case for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe as easily as any encounter of the first kind could.  If you then go on to consider that there are going to be civilizations millions or even billions of years more advanced than ours, then that means they&#39;ve had their singularity already.</p>

<p>A singularity occurring in a galaxy 13B light years away is functionally equivalent to one occurring here on Earth today.  It means absolute intelligence exists, already.  Technology as advanced as it can be, is.</p>

<p>So Enrico Fermi&#39;s question--where are they?--is left outstanding, and probably remains the last sensible word on the subject.  Whomever or whatever that is in possession of ultimate technology is capable of being here if it so chooses, of making itself known to us, of destroying us or enriching us.  Or just leaving us alone.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s obviously the latter, and it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s because we&#39;re ordinary and there are zillions of other life forms out there, or they have a Prime Directive and they actually abide by it, or they just don&#39;t give a fuck; our response should be the same regardless.</p>

<p>We need to be the ones who go and visit <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>We should be talking heavy-lift, space elevators, asteroid mining and nanotechnology.  Thinking about UFO&#39;s is akin to masturbation; great fun, but it doesn&#39;t really get us anywhere.  Want a productive conspiracy?  Why in the fuck aren&#39;t we on thorium yet?  A trillion dollars on Iraq and Afghanistan?  With that kind of money we&#39;d be on Mars by now.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still preying on each other.  The <em>Star Trek</em> ideal of getting our shit together here on Earth first before going out into space isn&#39;t just a neat fantasy, it&#39;s a recognition that simply as a practical matter doing space is going to require our full and undivided attention.</p>

<p>You want to discuss <em>seriously</em> something which, regardless of whatever conclusion we arrive at, gives us nothing.  We might as well be talking about sports.  This is why I don&#39;t do UFO posts.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe, or that I think the subject is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The whole conversation can be multiplied by zero with no discernible effect on anything that matters!</p>

<p>Where&#39;s my fucking warp drive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard it mentioned in the UFO/conspiracy/new paradigm crowds that there may be a Confederacy of Galaxies, which is similar to Star Trek&#39;s Federation. Say this is true, and in order to obtain status in the Confederacy, a planet must attain a certain level of peace, awareness and technological ability. Until then, the Confederacy keeps the planet in quarantine, whereby no other civilization may interfere with the planet&#39;s progression via direct interference.</p>

<p>I totally agree we need to get our planetary shit together and work towards making our home - EARTH - a better place for everyone. In order to do this, we need to stop fighting each other and figure out a way to work together towards a common good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although your post is insightful it seems like you are suggesting that we ignore UFOs completely and progress our technology independently in hopes of eventually making contact on our terms.  If there are extra terrestrials observing us I certainly think it is important to observe them and learn what we can.  I&#39;m not suggesting we stare at the sky and speculate; I&#39;m just saying that we have clearly not spent that much time and energy investigating UFOs (possibly due to hoaxes and science fiction etc).  They may not be as elusive and far beyond our science as we think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless we&#39;re talking about an <em>Independence Day</em>-style mothership doing a look-at-my-balls over Manhattan and I see the anchor of every news network wetting themselves amid a great deal of commercial-free hysteria, I&#39;m simply not going to be moved unless <em>I see it for myself</em>.</p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re seen one, then I get it.  You&#39;re going to be obsessed for the rest of your life by this.  But if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s going to remain a great big MAYBE and no amount of investigation is going to move you from that position.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a plan, then that&#39;s different.  That is, if somebody comes up with a spreadsheet that shows that aliens are more likely to visit some place at some time, then sure, let&#39;s put cameras there.  That falls within the scientific method; that might achieve results.</p>

<p>But if what we&#39;re left with is trying to figure out whether the thing is a frisbee or a lenticular cloud or ball lightning or some kind of military hardware, then forget it.  Put it on r/pics, and let&#39;s move on to working at decoupling science from the military so that maybe the day comes where we can actually take the initiative and work at making the event happen rather than just waiting for it.</p>

<p>The other interesting question is why? Why would a species capable of much faster than light speed allow themselves to be observed only through shaky amateur video and fuzzy photographs.

<p>And finally, to be so self righteous to think that a species so superior to ours is not only be able to journey to our backwater planet, but could somehow line up their visit within the time window of  the origins of our recordable history and when we either doom ourselves to oblivion or take to the stars (next 100-1000 years?), is silly. </p>

<p>They could have hard sci-fi Orion-style generation ships, we&#39;d only ever see their atmospheric exploration shuttles: Their mothership visits our system once every few thousand years, because of interstellar travel time. 
When they visit they do recon, take pictures of our settlements, land in isolated places to take samples from drugged specimens.
In the past they went about their business openly, but as of late we&#39;ve begun to pose a threat to them, so they&#39;ve been sneaking around.</p>

<p>All of which is pure fiction, but none of which contradicts our current understanding of physics; </p>

<p>P.S. if you want a sperm sample from a drugged ape, you need to use an electrical probe to stimulate the prostate gland, which induces immediate ejaculation.</p>

<p>P.P.S. Modern zoos now use a more humane method to collect DNA for their artificial insemination program meant to preserve biodiversity in their animal populations: Showing porn to gorillas  and having an intern give them a handjob. It&#39;s a lot less stressful for the animal and the employees, as you only need one girl to put one arm in the cage instead of six guys holding down the beast to prison-rape the ape. 
(fun fact: they enjoy regular human porn, so not needing to make fancy gorilla porn saves on budget)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/chi-ufo-united-airlines,0,4694653.story">A flying saucerlike object hovered low over O&#39;Hare International Airport for several minutes before bolting through thick clouds with such intense energy that it left an eerie hole in overcast skies, said some United Airlines employees who observed the phenomenon.
...</a></p>

<p>Conclusion: Who flies their top secret experimental craft to the 2nd busiest airport in the world (its 4th now). 64 million people passed through 2009 and there are average 2,409 flights per day (2008). The object appeared 4:30pm and highly visible. Hard to believe, a secret flying device would be flown in one of the busiest airport in the world, where it could hit a plane, etc...</p>

<p>Such an object posses the threat of hitting planes, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be a concern with airline or faa. Also, one of the flight crew who contacted the towers took a picture of it and people who witnessed including pilots provided sketches of the craft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is cool! There is a chapter about this incident in the aforementioned Leslie Kean book I just finished reading! There is a tape of the United supervisor&#39;s call to the air traffic control tower that was released by the FAA! I will write down the transcript. <strong>First</strong> it is interesting to note that at first, the FAA and United Airlines denied having any information about the incident, that is until the tape was released. Here is the transcript:</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, did you see a flying disc out by C17?&quot; asked the supervisor, giving her name as Sue. Laughter is audible from tower operator Dave and a second person nearby. &quot;That&#39;s what a pilot in the ramp area at C17 told us,&quot; she continues. &quot;They saw some flying disc above them. But we can&#39;t see above us.&quot; The laughter continues nervously, and Dave replies, &quot;Hey, you guys been celebrating the holidays or anything, or what? You&#39;re celebrating Christmas today? I haven&#39;t seen anything, Sue, and if I did I wouldn&#39;t admit to it. No, I have not seen any flying disc at gate C17.&quot;</p>

<p>About 15 minutes later, Sue calls back again, this time reaching operator Dwight. The conversation is as follows:</p>

<p>Sue: &quot;This is Sue from United.&quot; (laughter)</p>

<p>Tower: &quot;Yes.&quot; (serious tone)</p>

<p>(12 second pause)</p>

<p>S: &quot;There <em>was</em> a disc out there flying around.&quot;</p>

<p>T: &quot;There was a what?&quot;</p>

<p>S: &quot;A disc.&quot;</p>

<p>T: &quot;A disc?&quot;</p>

<p>S: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>T: &quot;Can you hang on one second?&quot;</p>

<p>S: &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>(pause, 33 seconds)</p>

<p>T: &quot;Okay, I&#39;m sorry, what can I do for you?&quot;</p>

<p>S: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, there was, I told Dave, there was a flying disc outside above Charley 17 and he thought I was pretty much high. But, um, I&#39;m not high and I&#39;m not drinking.&quot;</p>

<p>T: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>S: &quot;So, someone got a picture of it. So if you guys see it out there--&quot;</p>

<p>T: &quot;A disc, like a Frisbee?&quot;</p>

<p>S: &quot;Like a UFO type thing&quot;</p>

<p>T: &quot;Yeah, Okay.&quot;</p>

<p>S: &quot;He got a picture of it.&quot; (laughs)</p>

<p>T: &quot;How, how, how high above Charley 17?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes heard of the book, the author was on cobert report a while ago and waiting for it to drop on amazon. </p>

<p>As for the transcript, yes I read it too and there is more details about this incident: transcripts from other workers reporting the incident to the tower, analysis of weather, interviews with observers, etc... through a report from the NARCAP (national aviation reporting center on anomalous phenomena). Its called, &quot;report of an unidentified areial phenomenon and its safety implications at O&#39;hare international airport on November 7, 2006; Case 18&quot;. You can find this document by searching for &quot;Ohare UFO TR10_Case_18.pdf&quot;.</p>

<p>According to the interviews, six people were taking many pictures but can&#39;t find any online. The object was also observed by fliers and people were talking about inside the terminal. A majority of anonymous airline workers, particularly baggage handlers, said they would be fired if they talked about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was one of the official stories. That story becomes a bit strained once you know about the audio tapes and everything. These guys were scared shitless. <a href="http://ufovideo.blogspot.com/2006/12/ufo-rendlesham-forest-incident-charles.html">HERE</a> is one of the sites where you can listen to the audio from that night. Nick Pope- the guy who was in charge of the Ministry of Defence&#39;s investigations into the UFO business says that the incident was most certainly not caused by a lighthouse. There was trace evidence on the ground.</p>

<p>Also one of the guys touched the hull of the craft, and they even wrote down some symbols they found on the side of the craft. <a href="http://www.nickpope.net/rendlesham-forest.htm">HERE</a> are the sketches they did, along with an explanation of how Nick Pope began a cold case review of the Rendlesham Forest incident in 1994.</p>

<p>It was no lighthouse. That is just one of the explanations that ends up getting picked up and remembered whenever the case is mentioned.</p>

<p>I think that dismissing the &quot;abduction&quot; phenomenon, using all caps but giving no explanation, is unfair and arrogant. Especially when you are complaining about people doing the same about UFOs.</p>

<p>How do you know there hasn&#39;t been an organized campaign of violations of people&#39;s basic human rights for scientific or pseudo-scientific purposes? People&#39;s incoherent half memories could be distorted by drugs, or other methods of disrupting brain functions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, you are entirely correct in saying that. I put the emphasis on there for mainly one reason. I did not want to distract from the basic concept of UFOs. The abduction phenomenon is a whole other HUGE can of worms, and I wanted to keep it simple for the sake of the basic argument. In retrospect, it was a bit of a curt dismissal of the phenomenon. I have read many books on abduction, and honestly, I cannot seem to wrap my head around it either way. There are simply too many variables. What would do it for me, I think, is if two people who did not know each other, and were from different parts of a state or of the country, later described the exact same abduction, including unique-to-that-abduction &quot;OZ Factor&quot; details, or at the very least a simple idiosyncrasy that confirmed the two people were on the same ship, and were afterward returned to their separate locales. </p>

<p>TL;DR- That was hypocritical of me. Sorry. :/</p>

<p>I think the &quot;phenomenon&quot; is in fact several different things that are lumped together because they have elements in common. But I also think that people dismiss those assembled accounts without giving the subject serious thought, and that&#39;s a shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I can totally see that. This is what has bugged me most about the phenomenon. One of the reasons I have a difficult time with it is because every few months, I wake up in the middle of the night, paralyzed. It is very frightening. I always experience the &quot;classic&quot; sleep paralysis. Struggling with all my might to move, all in vain, I feel a presence in the room(sometimes I can &quot;feel&quot; the bed move as if something is walking on it), I become panicked, etc.</p>

<p>What has also always bugged me is the religious symbology/mythological symbology. There was one abduction case where a woman described being taken to another planet, where there was a giant bird that turned to ashes(Phoenix), and the Aliens even started proselytizing to her. I believe there was even a Triangle symbol on their ship. </p>

<p>What is fascinating to me, though, is some of the more fantastic accounts. So fantastic, you wonder why on Earth someone would go through all the trouble of making it up. It makes me wonder if maybe the brain simply fills in the blanks of a person&#39;s lost/blocked memories with subconscious dream-like filler--hence all the symbology and bizarre encounters. SEE?! This is why I want to keep it simple. Too much going on. I start to go off on tangents and let my imagination go nuts. :)</p>

<p>We&#39;ve proved just in the last ten years that life can exist in forms we never expected.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Bashar, that might be the best place for contact. See the 32 minute mark in this video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4100471449821338704#">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4100471449821338704#</a></p>

<p>Not that I necessarily believe that Bashar is real. But it&#39;s an ostensible extraterrestrial suggesting a location that may be more amenable to contact.</p>

<p>edit: but seriously, what could we do? How would we try to contact them? Telepathy? What purpose would it serve? What would you want the contact to entail? Sitting down and sharing technology? Taking a tour of the cosmos? Just seeing a craft hover for a bit? Helping us to develop spiritually or cognitively? Having our reproductive organs sampled for a hybrid breeding program?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I waited a month to post this, because I intentionally want it to be buried in the comment section of this post, but it might just be that someone out there in redditland has had an experience with the same guy/material.</p>

<p>Please treat the following story as hearsay.  Although I am typing these things as I remember them actually happening, memories can be faulty, subjectivity is always injected, and I may not be as accurate as I&#39;m trying very, very hard to be.  I&#39;ll try to keep it just to the facts.</p>

<p>There was once a man who&#39;s last name I don&#39;t remember, but his first name was Joe.  This man owned an occult bookstore in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  I&#39;d visited that store because I knew an ancient friend of his, another man by the name of Russel, who owned another occult bookstore in Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p>Both bookstores were teeming with the usual curios, but the one owned by Joe, in Allentown, PA was teeming with curios of a radically different sort than Russel&#39;s place in Chicago.</p>

<p>Joe sold things like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the heart of an adult male african lion, less than 30 days old, bathed in some kind of brown liquid that smelled like a combination of myrrh and pepper.</p></li>
<li><p>a stylus (ink-well type) whos nub was sterling silver, engraved with hebrew and enochian letters.  The shaft of the stylus was fashioned from what he said was a human pinkie finger (and it looked like it).  He claimed it was owned by Aleister Crowley, and I believed him, since he had a number of other widely photographed Crowley artifacts, like #3 below.</p></li>
<li><p>a copper helmet with rams horns attached to the sides, photographed a number of times on Crowley&#39;s head as he made spooky poses for the photographer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>... and a wide variety of other equally weird and rare artifacts from the occult world.  They were all for sale to the sorts of people who could afford them, and he often held private auctions to unload the most expensive of his lot.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s where the UFO thing comes in.</p>

<p>There was one item that was not for sale, and he kept it downstairs in a large, locked viewing case with a halogen pin-spot directly above it.</p>

<p>It looked like a piece of metal.  It was trapezoidal in shape, though it was bent a bit in the middle and wobbled on two corners if you touched it.  Joe charged $25 for 30 minutes of physical examination and questions, while he stood guard over it.  He claimed that he&#39;d acquired it in trade from a man named Roger (didn&#39;t give the last name), who had for a while been a regular customer and usually turned up with very weird items to sell or trade.  Evidently Roger wouldn&#39;t say where he&#39;d gotten it from, but did make the claim that it was absolutely alien in origin, that he&#39;d been a witness to this, and that if he held on to it much longer he&#39;d be &quot;disappeared&quot;.</p>

<p>Joe said that the thought that Roger had contracted the &quot;malaclypse disease&quot;, which in a certain circle in those days was used to describe people who have some reason to be paranoid, but who slide into full blown clinical paranoia as a result of real persecution.  Joe believed that Roger believed he&#39;d had the experience that he described, and Joe left it at that.</p>

<p>I examined this piece twice and on two separate occasions about a week apart.</p>

<p>It was a small trapazoidal sheet of what appeared to be metal, grey in color with a more silvery tone at its edges.  There was a soft bend in the middle such that the most acute corners were bent in toward each-other slightly.  There were no markings of any kind that I could see with my naked eyes or feel with my naked finger tips; both sides were completely smooth.  The sheet was about 1/8&quot; thick, and had an area of 181.5 square inches. (I measured it with a tape measure that Joe handed me upon query) </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the funny bit.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t seem to weigh much of anything.  I mean it weighed something; Joe allowed me to drop it on the floor, and it fell to the floor the way a slightly bent, trapazoidal, entirely stiff piece of paper would fall to the floor.  </p>

<p>It felt like metal, and it sounded like metal if you tapped it with a coin.  (I believe I used a quarter)  It was absolutely unbend-able by me using on my hands, and Joe mentioned that he&#39;d try to bend it with a number of larger tools, but was unsuccessful each time. </p>

<p>And again, it&#39;s mass was very confusingly tiny.  It felt very much like picking up a piece of tissue paper; the fluid dynamics of the air itself created enough friction against its large surface to push the far edge down substantially when I picked it up.  I asked Joe if he had a scale or a balance, and of course he did.  He&#39;d been weighing the thing for a long time.</p>

<p>So we put it on his balance, which had an accuracy and minimum calculable of 1/10th of a gram.  The readout on the balance read &quot;0.0g&quot;.  Joe told me that it was less than 1/10th of a gram, and that when his dealer came over with his balance, the piece had a weight reading of 0.085g.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The owner of an occult bookstore twenty years ago let me play with a piece of a flying saucer and it didn&#39;t weigh anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually pretty close to a fairly common theory/hypothesis. The story goes that in a divergent timeline from our own, humans in the future have modified their DNA in order to improve it, and they reproduce through cloning. Eventually errors creep into the genes, and they need to refresh their breeding pool, basically. So these cousins of ours get into their interdimensional craft which allows them to hop over to a parallel timeline, ours, and they begin detaining humans (in much the same way we detain animals for experiments - there&#39;s not much empathy here) in order to extract reproductive materials so they can save their race/culture from destruction. I say race/culture because the product of these efforts aren&#39;t exactly the same race... it&#39;s hybrid races.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s one group, and they&#39;re generally called the greys, also sometimes called zetas (as some stories say they come from an area analogous to zeta reticuli).</p>

<p>Other groups are other random neighbors, not related to us necessarily, just curious about us but leaving us alone so as not to disturb our natural cultural evolution. And then some others are actually descendants of those hybrid races who feel a moral responsibility for what their &quot;grey&quot; ancestors did (or are doing) to their human ancestors here, so they come to help balance things out in different ways. Their cultures are so dramatically different from our own, being thousands of years in difference between us, that it is an extremely educational history lesson for them to observe and interact with us in different ways.</p>

<p>That&#39;s that story (the very basics of it), at least. There are variations. But I like that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understand that by interdimensionsal craft, I don&#39;t mean that these are necessarily existing in some hidden version of subspace, or a reality that is completely foreign to our own. You have to understand that in the context of that theory, the idea of time travel is such that all realities, all timelines, exist now and are happening at the same moment. Every moment of this reality, every time you experience another millisecond, you have, so to speak, traveled to another reality, another manifestation of all of creation. Time itself doesn&#39;t have any significance outside of this particular infinite set of realities, so if you can isolate your craft from this reality through the creation of something like a warp field on star trek, a bubble around you which allows you to circumvent inertia and all that jazz, then it takes only a little bit more (figuratively speaking) to simply step back in at another reality which is analogous to a different time from your origin. You aren&#39;t <em>actually</em> traveling to your past or future, but to a reality that effectively exists as a perfect copy of that time. If you travel to your &quot;past&quot;, nothing you do will impact your memories or your original reality at all. The &quot;back to the future&quot; model where Marty begins to disappear off of the photograph? Doesn&#39;t happen. Doesn&#39;t need to. As the future of the reality that you&#39;ve traveled to is a divergent fork from the one you came from. To speak in figurative terms, Time is not a single line, but a multidimensional field.</p>

<p>So yes, they are, in a sense, just traveling here from the future, but it is a different future than ours. In their past, humans made different decisions than we have. Imagine if you went back x number of years, you would eventually come to the point where our two histories are identical. A dimension in colloquial terms can mean a different timeline, and that&#39;s kind of what I mean when I said their craft were interdimensional.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s my understanding of that story. I have no proof for it in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry. I&#39;ll see if I can explain it better.</p>

<p>Here are three ways of looking at time and time travel:</p>

<ol>
<li> Time is a single line that you can move forward and backward on with a time machine.</li>
<li>Time is like a tree, where it starts out as a single line that you move back and forward on, but if you make a change at one part of the line, then a new branch is created, splitting off in a different direction from the original with different events happening in each.</li>
<li>There are an infinite number of straight lines, all right next to each other running parallel, and each of these is an individual timeline, an individual reality or universe. There&#39;s no way to go backward in any of them, only forward. But you CAN jump over to a neighboring line or reality that perfectly imitates your past or future.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first one isn&#39;t very useful. The second is useful as a metaphor, as a way of understanding it, but not quite literally accurate. The third is the closest to the way things actually work.</p>

<p>Each of these parallel timelines, these parallel realities, is unique. And there is an infinite number of them. Many are VERY VERY similar, so similar that you could not tell the difference by anything but a single atom between them. Others are so radically different that they likely resemble nothing we can imagine. And then there&#39;s everything in-between. Some of the realities are perfect copies of other realities as they existed in the past. So when you get into a time machine to go back in time, you actually are jumping over to a neighboring reality that is exactly like your past was - even though it isn&#39;t actually your past.</p>

<p>In order to step out of one of these timelines, you have to isolate yourself from it, you put yourself into a pocket or a bubble that is completely separate from everything to do with that reality, that timeline. Once you&#39;re separate, isolated, then you have open access to any of the other lines, those other universes or versions of reality.</p>

<p>In the case of the popular story of the greys, there are two relevant realities, two timelines. One is ours, the other is theirs. Alternatively, you could say that there are two branches in time, one is ours and one is theirs. At some point in our past, and a further point back in their past, we shared the same time, the same reality, the same universe. But something happened and we went one way and they went another way.</p>

<p>Now they have hopped out of their reality, entered ours (which is like a parallel branch on a figurative tree of time). Imagine that somebody tied a string from one tree branch to another. A line of ants begins at the trunk of the tree, and splits into two lines with one going up one branch and the other line of ants going up the other branch. A few ants from one of the branches cross the string to the other line of ants.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim any of this is true. It&#39;s just my best understanding of the story/theory. I hope it was less confusing this time... :-/</p>

<p>Here, I even put it into haiku format: </p>

<p><em>Greys</em></p>

<p>Ants climb up a tree</p>

<p>A string tied from branch to branch</p>

<p>Cousins meet again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the big problems with UFOs is the people involved in it and the &quot;research&quot; community. </p>

<p>I will try and be succinct here but the people that dismiss it out of hand have most certainly not looked in to it, there is a mystery there without question.</p>

<p>However I feel it is also a mystery that its self is determined to stay that way, there is only so far you can go and then need to really stop before getting sucked in to the silly side of it. After a certain level of knowledge it all goes to pure conjecture and total shit, the space brothers brigade and the exo-politics woo woo gang take over. </p>

<p>Maybe its due to the lack of solid proof or evidence but even people who were serious researchers tend to go fruit loops and then go pushing the spiritual side of it as if they know all the answers. </p>

<p>The simple fact is this: the people that have studied it only know one thing more than people who have not studied it: there is something to it and that is all, anyone that claims to know any more is not telling the truth. </p>

<p>The way things stand and have for many years is that there is no need for any disinformation around the topic from the powers that be, the community around the research does a better job of discrediting the whole field than the government could ever do. </p>

<p>Is there a mystery? For sure and it even <strong>could</strong> even involved extra terrestrials or something from another dimension, however anyone that claims to know more than that must be treated with the up most skepticism.  </p>

<p>Its a massively fun subject to look into however if you look into it trying to find the answer, you are setting yourself up for either disappointed and frustration or buying in to what can best be described as a religion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well put. I agree completely. I love researching the subject, but sometimes it&#39;s like looking for some good fanfiction on the World Wide Web. Sure, you can&#39;t wait to read about the ongoing adventures of Harry Potter &amp; Friends after the official books have ended, and you just want to see what&#39;s going on with the characters now. However, to get to the semi-well written stories, you have to slog through hundreds of pages worth of Hot Potter-on-Hagrid/Hagrid-on-Ron sloppy sex scenes, and by the time you get to a cool story the characters have lost their magic and your interest has waned.</p>

I wanted <em>so badly</em> to believe these things were real. However they were too smooth looking, and it was just too perfect a video to be real:( Thanks for reminding me!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need a new term for these objects. We do not know their exact origin or nature, but there ARE common traits that we have identified that separate them from a generic unidentified thing. The rapid acceleration, the sharp turns with seeming disregard for inertia, the sudden appearance and disappearance, and often the triangular, saucer, or cigar shape , as well as often massive size. Not all ufos with some of these traits have all of them, but the ones that have been most interesting, the ones that we want disclosure on, that 5%, they all have at least some of these traits.</p>

<p>I propose a new naming scheme, so that I no longer have to hear the same argument that unidentified means I don&#39;t know what it is. I know that it is of the same class of things that these experts have seen, I know that it does things that no human-made technology is capable of, etc.</p>

<p>So instead of UFO, instead of unidentified flying object (is that a military term?) let&#39;s call them something like non-traditional flying objects, extra-terrestrial flying objects, super-technological flying objects (that is, beyond our level of technological capability), etc. It may not seem like much, and everybody KNOWS that UFO means these kinds of things, but I think that language and semantics really do change the way that people respond to things, and that especially when everybody already has decided how they feel about UFOs, a simple accurate relabeling of this phenomenon can have a serious positive impact in the search for truth.</p>

He is arguably one of the most important figures in the whole UFO phenomena. He didn&#39;t just merely witness a UFO, he actually headed up Army R&amp;D at the Pentagon and reversed-engineered the technologies foumd within the Roswell craft. </p>

<p>Is there some reason I hardly ever see him cited as a credible source? Has he been proven to be uncredible? As far as I know all of his credentials check out, he did headup Army R&amp;D at the Pentagon during the 50&#39;s. If anyone hasn&#39;t read it he also authored the very intriguing &quot;The Day After Roswell&quot;, which recounts his connection to the events after the crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of your evidence is good, but the Phoenix Lights (Or at least the famous one that was filmed by amateurs) were proven to be flares. There is a mountain range that you can not see in the video because it is night and very dark, but it is there. The lights disappear exactly where they would because they fall behind the mountain range. There are numerous videos on youtube, etc. that show an overlay of the mountains and how the lights basically just fall behind the mountain.</p>

<p>All your other evidence is pretty good though. I do think there needs to be more research on what exactly UFO&#39;s are.</p>

<p>Watch the video.  The &quot;ufos/lights&quot; went out exactly when the <strong>flares</strong> went behind the mountain.  It is as clear as it can be.</p>

<p>I agree that there needs to be more research into this sort of thing.  However, when there <strong>is</strong> research that gets done, and it happens to prove the opposite of what people want to believe, that doesn&#39;t mean the research gets to be dismissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human perception is highly flawed and unreliable. Eyewitness accounts, even from respectable sources, are not enough to base any assumptions on. Hell, if I saw an alien appear right in front of my eyes, I would still not believe in alien visitors. I&#39;d go to a hospital to have my head checked. That&#39;s why scientists uses highly sophisticated tools for their observations. Our eyes and ears are too easily fooled.</p>

<p>Now, for the reason why I categorically dismiss extraterrestrial visitors. Let&#39;s assume that there are several highly advanced civilizations within the Milky Way that have perfected interstellar travel. Even assuming they somehow manage to break the laws of physics, the chance that they would visit us is astronomically low. Why? The Milky Way is fucking huge. I mean, just go and do some resarch on the size of our galaxy. How the hell is anyone supposed to find us? That would be like finding one specific grain of sand somewhere on Earth. Even were you to send robots to search all over the earth, what if that one grain is somewhere on the bottom of the Mariana trench? And what&#39;s more, you wouldn&#39;t even know what it is you&#39;re looking for- how it looks, behaves or how to communicate with it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why anyone with any understanding of our Universe will dismiss alien visitors. Mathematically speaking, it&#39;s almost certain that there are several intelligent lifeforms out there, but it&#39;s also certain they&#39;ll never reach us.</p>

<p>EDIT: Oh and the only instance where you provided non-eyewitness evidence, those Trinidade photos? A quicky wikipedia search reveals: &quot;The photographs were rumored as being a hoax, and that was confirmed by a major TV show in Brazil on August 2010.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going to have to show me the link to the Trinidade photo fakery. The most recent article I have read says no such thing. I&#39;m sorry to say that you lay out your bias from the very beginning. I am willing to admit that I may be wrong. You are not. That is your first mistake, and it shows a hubris that does not belong in the scientific method.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why anyone with any understanding of our Universe will dismiss alien visitors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is an extremely arrogant statement that has no basis in fact, observable or otherwise. I know plenty about our Universe, and so do many of the people that have come to believe that <em>some</em> UFOs are extraterrestrial in nature. I am talking about people with doctorates. Physicists, Astrophysicists, and Astronomers. Are you saying that these people have no understanding of our Universe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mathematically speaking, it&#39;s almost certain that there are several intelligent lifeforms out there, but it&#39;s also certain they&#39;ll never reach us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say this with such certainty that it is insulting. To say such a thing is <strong>certain</strong> not to happen again shows your obvious bias, and again shows more hubris than true Science allows for. I recommend that you read Michio Kaku&#39;s <em>The Physics of Extraterrestrial Civilizations</em>, which you can read <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6236369/The-Physics-of-Extraterrestrial-Civilizations-by-Michio-Kaku">HERE</a>. In it, Dr. Kaku describes possible Type I, Type II, and Type III civilizations. Now read his theories about what a Type III civilization might be like. Sure, it may be speculation, but it is speculation by a man that <strong>DOES</strong> have an &quot;understanding of our Universe&quot;, and I am reasonably certain it is better informed than your own. </p>

<p>I mean no disrespect, but it is people like you that just brush the entire subject off, all while doing absolutely minimal or no research at all, and yet you claim that Science is on your side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, do refer me to the physicists, astrophysicists and astronomers who believe in alien visitors. I&#39;m curious.
And I know about the different types of civilizations and all. Kaku does not argue that we&#39;ve had alien visitors, he just speculates on the different form intelligent civilizations could take. Either way, this does not undermine my argument.</p>

<p>So please do explain: how exactly are alien visitors to find Earth? </p>

<p>As for the Trindade photos, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=trindade+ufo+hoax&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:nl:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a">here</a> is a quick Google search. Apperently it was on Brazillian TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the Trinidade link. My Googling must be suffering. They are not the most impressive photos anyway. That is why I am very cautious about most UFO sites. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pw13F7ahjY">HERE</a> is Michio Kaku talking about the ~5% of UFO cases that truly are unexplained, once you have ruled out misidentification, hoaxes, etc. He has an understanding of the Universe, and he is NOT ruling anything out. That is my point.</p>

<p>As for the Scientists you were curious about, here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>General Alain Orszag, Ph.D. in physics, armaments engineer. He is one of the authors of the COMETA report. I have linked it in the comments. You really should read it. It is fascinating.</p></li>
<li><p>Peter A. Sturrock, emeritus professor of applied physics at Stanford University; much of Sturrock&#39;s career has been devoted to astrophysics, plasma physics, and solar physics. (From Wikipedia.)</p></li>
<li><p>Though he is now dead, famous Astronomer Dr. Josef Allen Hynek. He even went as far as to label himself a UFOlogist(I hate that term).</p></li>
<li><p>Jacques Fabrice Vallée, Computer Scientist and Astronomer. He co-developed the first computerized mapping of Mars for NASA and he is known for his work at SRI International in creating ARPANET, a precursor to the modern Internet. He refers to himself as a UFOlogist, as well.</p></li>
<li><p>James E. McDonald(also deceased) was a Physicist, and he was senior physicist at the Institute for Atmospheric Physics and professor in the Department of Meteorology, University of Arizona, Tucson. He was, however, most well-known for his research regarding UFOs. He gave a famous lecture to the American Association for the Advancement of Science called <em>Science in Default</em>, which you can read <a href="http://www.narcap.org/commentary/scienceindefault.pdf">HERE</a>. It was a discussion of UFO evidence, and a fierce critique of the 1969 Condon Report, which many UFO researchers at the time felt was a complete whitewash. It has since been revealed that Condon did fudge the numbers and purposefully torpedoed the best evidence. He(McDonald) believed as I do-that the E.T. Hypothesis is plausible, though not entirely proven.</p></li>
<li><p>Richard F. Haines, senior research scientist who worked at NASA-Ames Research Center from 1967 to 1988 on projects such as Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and the ISS. He also managed the Joint FAA/NASA Head-up Display Evaluation Program. He was appointed Chief of the Space Human Factors Office at NASA-Ames in 1986. He has published more than 75 papers in leading scientific journals, and over 25 US government reports for NASA. He now serves as Chief Scientist for the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP).</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Maurice Biot, Aerodynamicist and Mathematical Physicist. He has said: &quot;The least improbable explanation is that these things are artificial and controlled. . .my opinion for some time has been that they have an extraterrestrial origin.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>Clark McClelland, Aerospace Engineer and Technical Assistant to the Apollo Program Manager during the Apollo moon landings, also assisted in almost six hundred launches at Cape Canaveral, and in addition to working in the Mercury and Gemini programs, Space Lab and the Space Station, was heavily involved in the Space Shuttle program. He is quoted as saying: &quot;The day will arrive when the governments of earth will finally admit we are not alone, that humans have come face to face with other lifeforms from the cosmos.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Herman Oberth, the father of modern rocketry has said: &quot;It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. John Sathco, an Astronomer at the University of Southern California. Quote: &quot;There are in excess of 200 reports of the type that we had from down in Louisiana, from people claiming that they have had direct contact with a spacecraft full of aliens.  I mean 200 reports from witnesses who are as reliable or more so than these people.  I&#39;m not counting the reports from the obvious crackpots that have an axe to grind....If you accept them at face value then you&#39;re forced to accept that we have been visited.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Stanton Terry Friedman, studied physics at the University of Chicago and worked as a nuclear physicist on Research and Development projects for several large companies. He is primarily a UFOlogist now. You have probably seen him before. He almost has the &quot;Me Gusta&quot; face.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you must remember that Carl Sagan himself, may have rejected the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis, but he still felt that UFOs were <strong>a legitimate topic of study.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope I was able to provide you with some good examples. I&#39;m sorry if I came off as harsh, perhaps even rude, but it annoys me to no end when someone tries to put such boundaries on Scientific research, or tosses the UFO subject in the bin without taking a good look at it first, as so many brilliant scientists, both now and in the past, have been known to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since it seems like you&#39;re well versed in ufo history, i&#39;d like to get your opinion on something. What is, in your mind, the best evidence ufos might be alien? I&#39;ve read almost everything you&#39;ve written, so my question isn&#39;t so much as education as it is about...i guess what your &quot;favorite&quot; bit of information floating around is. What is that one thing, that one incident or that one person that makes you believe?</p>

<p>And just as an fyi, i&#39;m a former believer now skeptic. Somewhere in the middle but at this point leaning toward there not being much to ufos. But i&#39;m always open to new information and ideas</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that is a great question. Personally, I am not positive these objects are from another planet. There are other possibilities. Other dimensions, or something we have never even thought of as of yet. I, like John Keel, often wonder about the fact that a few hundred years ago, people saw Faeries all the time. People were supposedly abducted by them. Dwarves, Elves, Trolls, etc. were considered real. In the mid-1800s, people were seeing &quot;airships&quot;-basically large boats with wings/propellers/airbags that made them fly. Now we are further along technology-wise, and we are seeing advanced spacecraft. There is a very strange metaphysical aspect to some of this stuff.</p>

<p>Basically, there are quite a few cases that I will point out to you, just let me get the info and links together. I won&#39;t say that this is definitely an alien phenomenon. I do believe that a small percentage of it is, though. There are other explanations that I do consider, but there are so many witnesses, and so many experts willing to testify to the alien hypothesis. Sorry if I seem all over the place, but I have gone through mountains of info like this, and some of it is strange. </p>

<p>Consider for one moment that what we as humans <strong>don&#39;t know everything there is to know about astrophysics</strong>(which we don&#39;t). </p>

<p>Also consider for one moment that technologies may exist that allow for the bending of space-time, to facilitate travel to and through other locations WAY far away (millions of light years). </p>

<p>Consider ALSO (I know this is a lot to ask) that the very definitions we attribute to things like &#39;matter&#39;, &#39;time&#39;, &#39;space&#39; and &#39;energy&#39; will almost CERTAINLY be modified in the coming decades and centuries as we learn more and more about natural laws and the various unification theories that are currently being discussed. </p>

<p>My point is that human beings are fucking ignoramuses when it comes to the mysteries of the universe and how everything works together, from quarks to photons to plasmas to black holes. </p>

<p>To presume that &#39;nothing can travel at the speed of light&#39; is KNOWLEDGE is just DAFT. Reconsider what you <em>think</em> we know about the universe and try again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, there is so much we don&#39;t know. But that does not mean we can just make up stuff and let our imaginations run wild. Thinking in this way is how religion functions. </p>

<p>Instead of focusing on what we don&#39;t know, consider just how much we as a young, feeble species do know. We have peered out to the edge of space. We have seen galaxy form and die. We have- indirectly- observed black holes and their awesome power. And throughout all our observations, the laws of physics have remained rock solid. </p>

<p>Look, I would love for there to be faster than light travel. But the fact that I really want it and can imagine it combined with the fact we don&#39;t know everything yet still does not add up to it being a realistic possibility.</p>

<p>I guess you and me are somewhat divided by a degree of idealism. I don&#39;t mean that in a derogatory way- maybe I&#39;m just a bit more cynical than you. But I tend to consider the world and the universe more in terms of what we know instead of what might be.</p>

Nowhere in the observed universe have we found the laws of physics to be broken. To argue that they could be broken is pure conjecture and imagination at this point. </p>

<p>If you want to argue from a standpoint of our ignorance- we don&#39;t know everything thus everything is possible- you can argue for anything at all. You could argue for the existence of God. The aliens you seem to be arguing for appear to be magical beings that are bound by completely different sets of laws than us. If so, why would they even care about reaching us? Why would they even acknowledge us? We would be but mere ants to them. The discussion comes to a dead end if we argue from this standpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our calculations break down in black holes, not the laws of physics. We do not know what happens beyond the event horizon.</p>

<p>And for the umpteenth time, of course our knowledge is incomplete. That does not mean absolutely anything is possible. Sure, we don&#39;t really understand gravity. But we observe something we call gravity and we have models to describe it to a certain extent, good enough to launch rockets and fly planes. So if gravity is actually a different force than we understand it to be from our models, does that mean cities will suddenly start to float?</p>

<p>To say that aliens might follow different laws (and let&#39;s not kid ourselves, faster than light travel would not mean a better understanding of the laws of physics, it would mean our laws are wrong and there are other laws that are right) allows you to argue for absolutely anhything. Maybe they can peer into our souls Maybe they are everywhere at once. Maybe we live inside a simulation run by aliens.</p>

<p>Saying we do not understand everything and saying anything is possible is completely different. I&#39;m completely open to the notion that some day the laws of physics might be revealed to be wrong. But I&#39;m not going to speculate about what is possible if they are wrong and base my arguments on speculation, because that is pointless to me.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that light could travel the speed of light.  Trolling aside, you are mistaken, nothing can <em>accelerate</em> to the speed of light because it&#39;s mass increases as it&#39;s speed does.  More mass means more energy required to further accelerate said object.  That being said, this assumes that gravity is in the equation.  Gravity is something that we do not fully understand.  We consider it to be one of the four universal forces, but even this is being challenged. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/04/is-gravity-a-result-of-thermodynamics.ars">See here.</a> At this point, to suggest that an alien species is limited in its technology by <em>theories</em> created by humans is absolutely preposterous.  Think for just a moment how far we have progressed in the last 50 years...the last 100...the last 1000.  Now imagine a civilization with double, triple, maybe even more time in existence than us.  You mean to tell me that we humans, where we stand right now, know exactly what can and cannot happen in the universe?  I know you think that science says that we can&#39;t possibly have had extra-terrestrial visitors, but thats <strong>our</strong> science that says that.  <strong>Our</strong> science that is limited to <strong>our</strong> limited age and understand as a race.  For all we know, their (an extra-terrestrial race) science could far surpass ours, and by far I mean so far we may not even be able to comprehend it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Science most certainly <em>does not</em> say that there isn&#39;t. I already know the argument you have presented. I am not some UFO nut that just assumes all these here UFOs done come from another star! There are quite a few different explanations as to their origins. A few of which are that they are simply government aircraft. I am not arrogant enough to say that I am definitely right. As I told another poster-hubris has no place in Science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, we have technology which just looks for objects that may hit Earth (Near Earth Asteroids). We would have spotted it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that so? You can hardly say that for certain. You know as well as I do how many man-hours, how many satellites, and how much equipment it takes just to fully scan a swathe of the sky. There is a reason that Astronomers rely on amateur astronomers for assistance in such matters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say &quot;we did, but the government is covering it up.&quot; Seriously? If 10 people know the whole world would know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you are being ridiculous. Did you not read the part where I said that <strong>literally hundreds of scientists, experts, military officers, pilots, seamen, government officials, etc. from all across the world</strong> have come clean about their experiences regarding UFOs, even after being ordered to be quiet about it? That&#39;s what you meant, right? Secrets like that? If your point is that nothing can be kept secret, would you mind telling me exactly the nature of the top secret experimental aircraft that they test at Area 51? Mind you, I do not believe they fly saucers around, I believe they simply deal with Skunkworks(experimental secret government projects). If you cannot tell me exactly what they are working on and what kind of aircraft they keep at Area 51, obviously the Government <em>can</em> keep secrets, can&#39;t they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the viable response to the criticism is that it is premature.  We should be at the information gathering stage, not the toss around and dismiss explanations stage.  </p>

<p>To claim that UFOs are aliens or that they don&#39;t exist because aliens can&#39;t travel at FTL speeds is jumping the gun.</p>

<p>We should be at the stage of &quot;there appears to be a mysterious phenomenon that warrants a methodical scientific study&quot; phase.</p>

<p>Regarding FTL travel, there are plenty of articles in various scientific journals by physicists theorizing various methods of FTL.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive">Alcubierre drive</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#Traversable_wormholes">Lorentzian traversable wormholes</a></p>

<p>Basically the general theory of relativity does not rule out &quot;apparent&quot; or &quot;effective&quot; FTL.  However we don&#39;t as yet know if these models are physically possible.  </p>

<p>FTL appears impossible or too energy intensive with our current understanding of physics.  That being said, we know that we don&#39;t have the complete picture of physics (quantum+gravity, dark energy, dark matter).  Who knows if something allowing FTL might turn up.</p>

It doesn&#39;t matter that they&#39;re redundant, it&#39;s a chain reaction. And it&#39;s a self-regulating process. If they worked perfectly and could travel at relativistic speed then saturating the entire Milk Way could happen in less than 500,000 years.

    <div class="md"><p>My bad, 0.01c is reasonable. 
Yeah, this would be the only reasonable way for any advanced civilization to explore the galaxy. But I do not find it very credible. It is asuming too much: A civilization advanced enough to create this technology. Probes that worked perfectly under all kinds of extreme circumstances. Incredibly complex and refined probes that can assemble new copies from scattered base materials, under extreme conditions. Not only that, they can make perfect copies. Enough copies for the 4x10<sup>11</sup> stars in the Milky Way. These probes being sophisticated enough to escape the gaze of astronomers and star gazers but not sophisticated enough to be discovered and kept secret by governments. These probes being any use at all to the civilization that created them: sending communications back would take ages. And at every step of the way we have to consider cataclysmic events taking place. </p>

<p>I think this approach is the most reasonable and realistic way of thinking about alien civilizations reaching Earth. But to me it&#39;s still more scifi than something to take into serious consideration. Unless some actual some actual, scientific observations, and not just eyewitness reports, would indicate the presence of artificial satellites somewhere in the galaxy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why on earth would they need to be incredibly complex? The assumptions you are making are enormous. They make copies of themselves out of random celestial minerals. They would have to be robust and simple. </p>

<p>The correct way of thinking about this is not &#39;how would humans go about this&#39;? The correct way of thinking about this is &#39;what could happen in this time frame?&#39; Why would the probes even have to communicate with their home planet? Why couldn&#39;t they be uploaded sentient beings of some sort? Why couldn&#39;t a culture do it for the hell of it? Why couldn&#39;t they be filled with flash-frozen zygotes for colonization? The point is, you can&#39;t put human constraints on a theoretical problem like this and use it to justify a point. I&#39;m not saying those are likely scenarios, I&#39;m just pointing out the possibilities are almost endless. </p>

<p>By saying that aliens are a or scientific fallacy you&#39;re ignoring the fact that it takes almost nothing in cosmic terms to completely blanket the entire galaxy with self-replicating machinery traveling at non-relativistic speeds. I&#39;m not arguing that having actual extraterrestrials contact us any time soon is an easy pill to swallow. I&#39;m arguing that the idea that aliens don&#39;t exist because &#39;it&#39;d take too long to get around the galaxy&#39; is ludicrous on a cosmic time scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing that aliens don&#39;t exists, I&#39;m arguing that aliens visiting Earth is not a credible notion.</p>

<p>The probes would be complex because any self-replicating machine that finds, mines, refines and processes the resources needed for its construction, then creates the compononts needed along with some engine and energy source for those times it will be out of reach of any stars, while remaining functional throughout many years of interstellar travel has to be complex.</p>

<p>Look at it like this: today, a moped to us might not be very complex. It might indeed be very robust and simple. You might be able to build one out of spare parts in your garage. But if you&#39;re out in the desert, can you repair it? Can you recreate it?</p>

<p>Anyway, this is all besides the point. I was arguing that it took too many assumptions to think it realistic. And now you make even more assumptions: being that upload their consciousness, probes filled with flash frozen zygotes.</p>

<p>It seems everyone here is interested in pure speculation. In that case, you&#39;re better off reading scifi than asking for a serious discussion. If you are going to dismiss human understanding because aliens are unknowable, than what are we arguing here? What&#39;s the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Believing in aliens is no different then believe in God.</em> That was the argument I was refuting.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not making assumptions at all, and apparently did not articulate my argument well. The point is not I assume all extraterrestrials will become computer probes and explore the galaxy. The point is you can come up with an almost limitless number of reasons why they <em>could</em>, and ignoring the galactic time scale is anathema to a legitimate conversation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>The moped argument is fallacious. I might not be able to rebuild a moped in a desert. But if I can make a moped that repairs itself and is independent, then send it to a desert <em>made pretty much completely out of moped parts</em>, then it had better be able to fix itself. Otherwise I obviously did a poor job of designing a von Neumann probe.</p>

<p>I <em>completely agree</em> that aliens visiting Earth in a human generational time period is bizarre. Again, I completely disagree that extraterrestrials can be disproved by the statement &#39;it&#39;d take too long to get around the galaxy&#39;.</p>

<p>PS- &quot;If you are going to dismiss human understanding because aliens are unknowable&quot; you do realize that there is no other way to judge a hypothetical activity, right? Human constraints help only a tiny tiny amount when we&#39;re talking about a subject that has never been empirically proven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems we actually agree. I do believe aliens are out there. And taking astronomical timescales, it is possible they will reach Earth. I still do not believe they already visited us though.</p>

<p>But on your last point: I would argue that the only reasonable way to argue for hypotheticals is from our own understanding, becasue that is all we can be certain of. Take what we know as absolute (laws of physics) and extrapolate from our current situation. So theorizing about dyson spheres and von Neumann probes is highly interisting and worthwile. However, when we say that human understanding is useless when considering alien civilzations, I wonder how you are supposed to consider these without veering off into pure fantasy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you cannot claim &#39;empirical speculation&#39;. If we ever do meet aliens, they will make absolutely no sense at all because the odds of them actually being constrained to the theoretical frame we&#39;ve built for them is ridiculously low, and we know absolutely nothing about them.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be like for a Saracen in 1,000 AD to claim some sort of knowledge about Aztecs. You can make fairly basic assumptions- they&#39;ll probably be people-shaped and have to eat food- but trying to have an actual scientific discussion cannot actually occur because there is no hard evidence. Same thing with extraterrestrials. You cannot say &#39;this is all just base speculation&#39; when <em>everything</em> to do with studying aliens is, by definition, speculation. </p>

<p>Example: They&#39;re probably constrained by the speed of light. Do we know that for sure? No. So it&#39;s not actual scientific evidence. </p>

We know barely a thing about space travel, so it is entirely possible that there are solutions that we as a species haven&#39;t considered yet. I personally don&#39;t believe in UFOs, but to compare extra terrestrial life to a supernatural being is a stunning display of pig-headedness.

I also think that dismissing a study of UFOs based on the perceived impossibility of the explanation is premature.  Frankly, our knowledge is too limited to be offering or dismissing explanations at this point.</p>

<p>There appears to be something going on that is as yet unexplained.  I&#39;d like for a scientific study to take place.  Maybe a clearinghouse for sightings and a network of experts in various fields to study the various encounters.  </p>

<p>The explanation could be some undiscovered natural or psychological phenomenon.  Or it could be some sort of alien beings.  Either way we don&#39;t know what it is other than something exists that isn&#39;t explained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here ya go...</p>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s do this.  There are <em>billions</em> of planets in our galaxy.  You &#39;ruled out&#39; one, (How many probes have we sent to that one that you ruled out, you know to study it thoroughly like you suggest we have?).  </p>

<p>After that there are only 999,999,991 to go?<br/>
The nearest candidate <em>that we have found</em> is only about 20 light years away.  And we have only been looking for a very short time...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, we have technology which just looks for objects that may hit Earth (Near Earth Asteroids). We would have spotted it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you possibly say that with a straight face?  The number of people looking for near earth objects at any given time is only slightly more than the number of people that staff one McDonald&#39;s hamburger restaurant.(The number is probably slightly larger but still extraordinarily modest).  And even so we have only just found our first earth orbit crossing asteroid in 1991, (named 1991 BA). It sailed past the earth at a distance of 106,000 away - the cosmic equivalent of a bullet passing through one&#39;s sleeve.  The next wasn&#39;t found until 1993.  It was somewhat larger and passed even closer (90,000 miles).  Both were not noticed until after they had passed by.  According to Tim Ferris near misses such as these probably happen 2-3 times a week and go <em>unnoticed</em>.  So much for that technology spotting stuff, eh?</p>

<p>An object that is only a hundred yards across couldn&#39;t be picked up by any earth bound telescope until it was very close and then only if the telescoped happened to be trained upon it otherwise it goes unnoticed <strong>everytime</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If 10 people know the whole world would know. Look at Bradley Manning. Look at when the Mars information leaked early on Twitter. This day and age nothing stays hidden. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right.  There are no secrets. All organizations, businesses and branches of governments contain less than 10 people so their secrets can stay safe.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But science says their isnt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you mean &quot;there&quot;.<br/>
And actually science doesn&#39;t say there isn&#39;t.  In fact &#39;science&#39; is fond of saying &quot;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And (I don&#39;t mean to sound impertinent) can you make a comment regarding to what was posted and not simply make a general comment on the likelihood of alien life travelling here.

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with your overall point and do not think we have been visited by an alien species, I really don&#39;t think that you can use measures of time as a good reason to rule it out.</p>

<p>For all we know, 12.5 years means fuck all to these hypothetical ETs. Hell, a thousand years could mean fuck all to them. Nor can we assume whether or not a given trip would be &quot;worth it&quot; for them, nor can we assume anything about their intentions, really.</p>

<p>Of course this is all hypothetical, but just to reiterate; the length of the trip measured by time does not, by any means, rule out the possibility. There are far better reasons to rule it out, so why use such a weak one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! This is why I bring up Michio Kaku&#39;s Hypothetical Type III civilization. It is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">Kardashev scale</a>. According to the scale, a Type III civilization is a civilization that is able to harness all of the power available from a single galaxy, approximately 4 ×1037 W. This figure is extremely variable, since galaxies vary widely in size; the stated figure is the approximate power output of the Milky Way. Kardashev&#39;s original definition was also 4 ×1037 W.</p>

<p>In one of Michio Kaku&#39;s speeches, he describes this type of civilization as being millions of years ahead of us technologically and evolutionarily. Imagine a species millions of years in advance of our own. I always think of Arthur C. Clarke&#39;s Third Law of Prediction. <strong>Any sufficiently advanced technology would be indistinguishable from magic.</strong></p>
