I would not describe myself as a conspiracy theorist, not until tonight at least. At first, I was looking up information on whether or not there could be a chemical reaction that could remove radioactivity from high level waste, essentially solving the nuclear waste debacle. I stumbled across this, and I&#39;m literally astounded.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick documentary: </p>

<p>This is an MIT cold fusion demonstration page: <a href="http://www.std.com/%7Emica/jeticcf10demo.html">http://www.std.com/~mica/jeticcf10demo.html</a></p>

<p>Website dedicated to the subject, outlining possible inventions: </p>

<p>Why do people not talk about conspiracies surrounding the biggest industry in the world? Our government has had a history of swiping up important information, such as with Nikola Tesla, clearly documented in his wikipedia page here:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla#Death">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla#Death</a></p>

<p>&quot;After the FBI was contacted by the War Department, his papers were declared to be top secret. The personal effects were sequestered on the advice of presidential advisers; J. Edgar Hoover declared the case most secret, because of the nature of Tesla&#39;s inventions and patents.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read one of the more detailed biographies of Nikola Tesla, arguably the least-known and least understood physics genius to ever live. Wardenclyffe Tower is based on real physics. Tesla&#39;s crowning achievement was dismantled by his investors, 90 years ago. Who&#39;s to say this process has not continued for all that time, suppressing key information and controlling the scientific community to write off anything with &gt;100% yield as pseudoscience?</p>

<p>Basically, the thought is that:
If technology that could produce energy at greater than 100% efficiency, would we know about it? The answer is absolutely no. We wouldn&#39;t. Too many forces are present to prevent this knowledge from becoming public as of yet. Too many people profit massively off expensive energy.</p>

<p>Why do people not talk about conspiracies surrounding the biggest industry in the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brother, a <strong>shit ton</strong> of people have been yelling these things that you&#39;ve just discovered at the top of their lungs for decades! The fact that you&#39;ve never heard of this cover-up before is only a testament to how far the people who have vested interests in big energy will go to keep this information from the public, and how deep the rabbit hole really is. </p>

<p>Many of us here are very well aware of the conspiracy surrounding Tesla and J.P. Morgan, but quite honestly these facts are so old and the public has been conditioned for so many years to believe that fossil fuels and nuclear energy are what keeps our economies in balance, it is extremely hard to break into the public consciousness which is (purposely) flooded with too many other issues and disinformation to make a dent. Another difficulty is that this way of thinking has been pushed so far into the fringes of what is considered to be conventionally acceptable, that those who bother to mention the facts are disregarded as wingnuts or &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, a term deliberately made derogatory by a compromised academia and media alike.</p>

<p>There are many, many of us who are very well aware that Tesla technology is a reality and has been used for over 50 years now in the most private of sectors. Do some research regarding scalar weapons, HAARP, etc. and you too will see how deep that rabbit hole really goes.</p>

<p>The energy conspiracy is an incredibly important one, and so is 9/11. There are many other issues that deserve our attention as well, but we are fighting an incredibly powerful enemy who have billions of dollars to throw behind their agendas, and billions more to keep them from public view. We do what little we can, trying to reach the very few out there willing to listen.</p>

<p>Welcome to the real world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And 2 more general thoughts on the subject:</p>

<p>I think the Tesla example is especially good because it was generally before our government made the leap into cold war militarization/umbrella black ops projects and secrecy. They used to be sloppy. Less cold and calculating, admitting to things like that. Now people just disappear.</p>

<p>Secondly, I do have hope. The ubiquity of information is amazing these days. Their job used to just be limited to keeping this information out of public hands, such as libraries. It&#39;s harder to keep things from people. Sure, there are downsides such as these entities using the Internet against you in the same ways we can use it to our advantage, but I think it&#39;s more positive than negative. Not everyone supports their agenda.</p>

<p>I think that may be all he will say. The team he worked in was a close-knit group of the smartest aeronautical engineers on the planet, the bleeding edge of weapons development. There is an extreme pride factor there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just feel like things like a 9/11 conspiracy are just inconsequential when literally so much of world politics centers around energy, yet it appears to me that the chances of there being a &quot;n-machine&quot; are astronomically high. </p>

<p>My grandfather worked under contract with Lockheed for 20 years. My grandmother would drop him off on a street corner and have no contact with him for weeks at a time; trust me, I know the rabbit hole&#39;s deep. He still won&#39;t talk about it. I just sort of realized just how important to world politics energy is and how powerless some countries/organizations would be without its high costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, I think 9/11 can be vitally important to this issue (and many others) because of the simple fact that if a conspiracy can be proven and it becomes accepted in mainstream consciousness, people will start waking up to the realities at hand. They will recognize how easily they were duped, and they will start questioning other things which they have been told is just &quot;conspiracy mumbo-jumbo&quot;. A whole generation of truth-seekers will be born, and oversight will become increasingly difficult to compromise. Capitulation will dwindle, more truths will be uncovered, and those who seek to shroud enlightenment with darkness will find it nearly impossible to satiate their greed.</p>

If the 9/11 conspiracy is true (and I&#39;m not gonna have an opinion on that), then energy is the reasoning for it. It&#39;s a bigger umbrella than just one terrorist attack on US soil, if anything its the biggest umbrella since there&#39;s the most money in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading about it and supposedly a 1 (10?) Mw power station is being built with it right now in Greece.  They say it works by a nano sized nickle, hydrogen and a catalyst, the nano nickle is to increase surface area and another process with an acid is done to increase the porosity even more.  The hydrogen bonds with the nickle and copper is made as the result, copper weighs less than the nickle so that mass was converted into other energy light and or heat and that is harvested (my rough understanding).</p>

<p>There is supposedly also a factory that has been running one in Bologna for a year now and it&#39;s heating bill has gone down by 90% so far.  All of this is very current on the website like this and the current month so it seems to be progressing well.  It is quite interesting of course and I&#39;m going to be keeping my eye on some developments.</p>

I have talked to soldiers that were on the ground early on in Afghanistan who say that we had gold plasma based generator technology that produced multi Megawatts of power and took no refueling during the time they were in use. The mechanism was explained as a device that accelerates a gold plasma and creates intense magnetic fields that are tapped and rectified to produce usable power.

<p>I believe that there are new sources of energy that are sitting unused and undiscovered.  Just like we learned to split an atom, we can learn to harvest other forms of stored energy.  Atomic fission isn&#39;t magically creating energy, it is releasing the energy stored in the atomic bonds into light and heat.  The energy was always there.  It would be foolish to say that we have discovered all there is to know about what energy sources there are in our universe, but we do know how all known energy sources behave, and we can expect new ones to follow the same laws until we observe something different or break out of our reference frame.</p>

<p>It can be deemed impossible by our current understanding. Science however is open to change if sufficient evidence is available to show us new science and theory.</p>

<p>Under our current understanding, &quot;free energy,&quot; is impossible because of the laws of thermodynamics. Now if there is a new physics that disproves this I would like to see the evidence. There is none; yet.</p>

<p>Sure, the energy companies could be suppressing it, but that&#39;s a different discussion.</p>

You have a problem that he was talking about the scientific method like that.

Edit:  Just to be clear, I&#39;m suggesting the boundry conditions are affected by geometry of the elements and vacuum potentials, and that in some configurations I think fusion may be more likely, and the reduced rest mass energy might be released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, conspiracy_throwaway, the Energy Conspiracy is indeed the mother of them all. Our entire economy is based on the &#39;energy as a limited, expensive commodity&#39; model, in order to keep a small group of people in power while the rest of humanity suffers under their control. The good news is that there&#39;s a growing community of researchers (myself included) that are working on these technologies from an open-source perspective. Many of us have realized that taking the route to commercialization courts danger and disaster, as the commercial and governmental interests involved have no desire to change the status quo. So, why not circumvent that whole nightmare and open-source this stuff to the world? That&#39;s exactly what many people are doing right now, and I think you are going to see some amazing announcements from that community this year. See pesn.com for more details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i came to the same conclusion. in my opinion it&#39;s almost obvious if you dig into the whole tesla story (and many others).</p>

<p>regarding free energy and the like: the sad part is that many scientists react almost the same as religious leaders, when you confront them with ideas that (might) contradict with what they&#39;ve been taught. </p>

<p>they treat mathematical, physical etc. assumptions as if they were fact. in science new assumptions of how things work are necessary to make progress, but they can also be wrong!</p>

<p>that&#39;s why some of the greatest inventions came from people who were outsiders/newcomers to a certain field. their minds were more open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a hard time upvoting your post because of your opening statement which I object to</p>

<p>but I did upvote it .</p>

<p>There is no place in the universe that is not chock full of energy. There is no need to create it out of thin air, It&#39;s there just waiting to be used.</p>

<p>There were more than 3000 patents that were grabbed by the government in just the past year because they were too efficient.</p>

<p>The downside of this efficiency is that there are people who I would be afraid of if they had unlimited free energy</p>

<p>but</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to chance it for the upside because the use of oil and the wars to control it are just as deadly and are employed by ostensibly &#39;sane&#39; people.</p>

<p>If the prevalence of greed and the level of it as practiced by current society was somehow reduced, then free energy would be an incredible opportunity for mankind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the greed or potentially the anger that is so dangerous.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping that free energy can come to be allowed  but people will have to grow up in very real fashion before it can be brought out safely.</p>

<p>Even you may have a foolhardy or overtly greedy neighbor who might be very dangerous with a billion free kilowatts</p>

<p>but a government, hell bent on controlling the oil trade, may be just as deadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend who is adamant about the idea that the biggest conspiracy in the world isn&#39;t 911 or the Illuminati but actually in the scientific community. I don&#39;t personally know much about electricity but he&#39;s been telling me for a while now that the fundamental way that we learn about how electricity and electric engineering works is flawed. He said that there are ways to use the earth as a source of energy and free energy is here it&#39;s just not &#39;useful&#39; in our culture. He&#39;s seen entire houses powered by cinder blocks and anti-gravity technology. He&#39;s sure that since the 70s or so technology has been limited and information regarding real technology has been stolen and destroyed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not quite of that opinion, that may be a bit on the crazy side imo. But there is one thing that is undeniable about science these days; the most cutting edge science is contracted military science and therefore classified top secret. There&#39;s no way to really know without an in what exactly the true extent of technology is these days and that&#39;s a little scary. The possibility that scientific breakthroughs that upset the status quo are buried is undeniable and extremely logical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the one of the significant conspiracies in the Scientific Community is that they&#39;ve convinced you that you can&#39;t learn what your friend appears to be an expert on from your perspective.   Throughout antiquity and beyond,  intellectual materialism has usurped the free propogation of information and technology as a result.   Thus,  [good] information and power are intertwined with one another.   For this reason alone you should feel compelled to learn what you can about Science and Technology on your own,  so you wont have to just take somebody&#39;s word for it.  You can do it!  It&#39;s like that scene from Good Will Hunting about $150,000 in tuition versus $1.50 in late charges at your local library! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t create energy out of nothing, as others have said. It&#39;s called the FIRST law of thermodynamics (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy">conservation of energy</a>). Energy can not be created out of thin air. Energy is either stored as potential energy or it is in action as kinetic energy. The closest we can come to creating energy &quot;out of thin air&quot; is through nuclear fission or fusion. But still, that&#39;s only since we&#39;re converting mass into energy (ala E=mc<sup>2</sup> )</p>

<p>If you have, say, have a perpetual motion machine EVEN if you were able to get it to move completely on its own you wouldn&#39;t be able to extract energy out of it. The act of turning a turbine to generate electricity would slow the perpetual motion machine. Friction can not be overcome. </p>

<p>The same principle works for any time of supposed &quot;free-energy&quot; machines. You can&#39;t extract energy from a source without taking energy away from it. Since you&#39;re taking energy away from it you must replenish that energy in order for the machine to continue working.</p>

<p>These are the laws of physics we&#39;re talking about. You can&#39;t overcome it.</p>

Edit:  Just to be clear, I&#39;m suggesting the boundry conditions are affected by geometry of the elements and vacuum potentials, and that in some configurations I think fusion may be more likely, and the reduced rest mass energy might be released.</p>
