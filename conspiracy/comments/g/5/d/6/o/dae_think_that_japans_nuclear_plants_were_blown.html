        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m amazed that I see a lot of conspiracy theories saying that Japan is covering up the severity of the nuclear emergency, but not a single one (OK, maybe one) about <strong>why the reactors blew up in the first place</strong> (or even possibly what caused the earthquakes).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, &quot;explosions&quot; at the reactors caused this.  Those explosions could be from Hydrogen gas, like they say... or they could be from someone planting an explosive device and setting it off.</p>

<p>Such an <em>obvious</em> potential conspiracy theory, yet not a peep from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  The front page is most telling in its conspicuous <em>lack</em> of coverage of this theory that I would imagine should be at the forefront of every conspiracy nut&#39;s lips right now.  <em>Is it being suppressed?</em>  Well, I suppose there&#39;s one way to find out:</p>

<p><strong>By starting things off</strong>:</p>

<p>The motives are twofold: sabotage Obama&#39;s nuclear ambition in the United States, and set off a global disaster that will upset/reset the world economy.  Since the economy is essentially one big Ponzi scheme, blaming the scheme&#39;s collapse on a &quot;causeless&quot; catastrophic event like this poses the only way to preempt the real reason: because we&#39;ve run out of money to prop up the pyramid.</p>

<p>The execution of such a disaster is highly feasible: setting off an explosion in a building is beyond simple.  As for the earthquake, they could have waited for it, or used HAARP if you believe that.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s discuss.  <strong>If you disagree, please do so intelligently.  If you&#39;re here to astroturf, crack a joke, ridicule, or espouse your anti-conspiracy rhetoric (without allowing proper debate), please take your conversation elsewhere.</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Bolded the last sentence for those of limited intelligence and attention span.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reactors lost power, and the backup generators were flooded by the tsunami. It&#39;s been explained repeatedly. Without cooling, nuclear reactors have a tendency to go sour.</p>

<p>TEPCO has a long history of covering up disasters. It&#39;s not a surprise that the information we&#39;ve been getting has <em>escalated</em>. They were simply hoping against hope that it wouldn&#39;t end up as bad as it&#39;s going to be.</p>

<p>The explosions did not cause the crisis. They are a result of the crisis.</p>

<p>The only conspiracy might be <em>how bad</em> the disaster is, not that it was planned. But you can&#39;t hide radiation so we&#39;ll eventually know how bad it is/was.</p>

<p>As bad as this disaster is, and as bad a nuclear disaster it could be, it would not be enough to destroy the world economy. They are talking hundreds of billions of dollars in physical damage. The US financial frauds have cost trillions.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve can&#39;t run out of money. It&#39;s not possible, as they are allowed to print as much as they want. It may cause hyper inflation, but there&#39;s always more money.</p>

<p>I would suggest you focus on more believable conspiracies.</p>

<p>Hyper inflation of one of the world&#39;s dominant currencies would probably cause a lot more harm than you seem to imply.</p>

<p>Wow. You are a genuine conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>In science (and forensics) the most logical theory is <strong>always</strong> the most correct theory. (In this case I interpret logical as meaning it&#39;s: <em>based on observation</em>, <em>contains quantifiable criteria</em>, <em>is testable</em>, and <em>can predict outcomes</em>.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;re trying to disprove something simply by saying it isn&#39;t true, that it&#39;s &quot;bullshit&quot;.  Am I supposed to take you at your word?  Why can&#39;t I just say &quot;It&#39;s totally not bullshit&quot; and have that be an equally valid argument?  This is the umpteenth time you&#39;ve done this.  Do you get why I am dissatisfied with your answers??</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you haven&#39;t presented a coherent argument that would benefit any conspirators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I have, it is the submission about which you&#39;re currently commenting.  The arguments are conveniently labeled with the numbers 1 and 2 in the headline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reset the world economy? What does that even mean, and how would anyone who has the power to execute a conspiracy like this benefit from it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Resetting the world economy means triggering the collapse of the Ponzi scheme.  Normally such a scheme would collapse after its operators could no longer afford the payouts.  The economy is one big bubble right now, and isn&#39;t collapsing only because the Fed keeps propping it up.  This can only go on for so long before they lose credibility.  Hence the need for a catastrophic event somewhere else to trigger the crash.  The perpetrators of the scheme make off with the greatest financial heist in the history of the planet, and it gets blamed on one of the worst disasters of the planet: the release of nuclear radiation into the most heavily populated city on Earth.</p>

<p>I am not trying to disprove anything. If you can read English and understand basic human psychology you would get that I am telling you the following:</p>

<p>&quot;I have seen no evidence that radio waves produced by HAARP have any effect on crustal tectonics, nor do I believe they intended to have any effect on crustal tectonics.

<p>And you can say &quot;it&#39;s not totally bullshit.&quot; And I would reply with, &quot;please show me any believable evidence that radio waves can cause earthquakes.&quot; And if you can, it&#39;s very possible I could change my opinion about HAARP.</p>

<p>Me telling you that I believe there are conspirators among us is &quot;impressive spin?&quot; Is everyone against you?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the Federal Reserve is a Ponzi scheme. I believe the United States is still operating under a philosophy that was effective in the 50s, including depending on productivity increase, population increase, and natural resource use. Unfortunately for them, the US population is stagnating (which is why they are encouraging immigration), productivity (in terms of both efficiency and automation) are increasing too fast, and natural resources are becoming more difficult to extract and use. On top of this instability, there has been huge financial fraud on the part of some very large corporations causing even greater problems.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m simplifying it. It&#39;s not, simply put, a Ponzi scheme and declaring it so is disingenuous at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me requote you:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s the point of explaining yourself now, when your previous comment still exists for everyone to see?  You&#39;re proving my point for me, that your previous statement was pulled out of thin air without any backup.  And you have the audacity to now ask <em>me</em> for evidence that HAARP <em>can</em> cause earthquakes?</p>

<p>You are horribly confused.  I never stated unequivocally that HAARP can cause earthquakes.  <em>You</em> stated unequivocally that it can&#39;t, and that there is no conspiracy to blow up the reactors, and that the event is <em>definitely</em> not big enough to upset the world economy.  All with no backup, and all stated with the confidence and expectation that people reading this just what... believe you at your word?  You&#39;re living in a fantasy world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Impressive spin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is in reference to your ability to write 3 whole paragraphs while not really answering the question.  It really is rather impressive.</p>

<p>Your final paragraph is your only redemption.  And I will respond to it fairly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there has been huge financial fraud on the part of some very large corporations causing even greater problems.... It&#39;s not, simply put, a Ponzi scheme and declaring it so is disingenuous at best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The financial fraud on the part of very large corporations WAS the Ponzi scheme.  That was the mortgage crisis, and the derivatives crisis.  That bubble within our economy turned our economy into a Ponzi scheme as well.  I will concede that declaring it a Ponzi scheme is at best an accusation on my part, and on the part of many experts far more knowledgeable than I am.  If you&#39;re interested in why I think it is a Ponzi scheme, read up on anything even remotely recent from Matt Taibbi.</p>

<p>I would love to know why you <em>don&#39;t</em> think it&#39;s a Ponzi scheme.  Why do we have to keep injecting money into the system, if it&#39;s not artificially being propped up right now?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yes, because how, exactly, would I provide evidence that HAARP can&#39;t?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Thanks. I&#39;m paid well.</p>

<p>Technically, the Federal Reserve providing liquidity to the markets is not a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes require <em>new</em> investors. When the Fed repeatedly buys Treasury Bonds, and the Government lends money at low rates, that&#39;s not a Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>But Social Security, on the other hand, really is a Ponzi scheme, as it is designed to require increased pay-ins to support payouts. </p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that we could go on and on. You set in your ways, and me set in mine. So take care; it&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ll give this thread much further thought.</p>

<p>I suppose you can tell yourself you &quot;won&quot; because I care little to go on, but I don&#39;t care much about that.</p>

It doesn&#39;t mean they think cheap generics are a good idea, it means they think holding both markets is a good idea.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s possible that both are true.  Just like most conspiracy theories, it is, at its heart, a theory.  There are suggestions that such an attack on a Japanese nuclear reactor happened a few years ago.  In that case, it was a relatively small earthquake and had relatively little impact.  There were also reports of unusual auroral activity beforehand.  In this recent disaster, there has been no mention of auroras, but things are so bad right now I doubt it would be mentioned for a while even if they were seen.</p>

<p>I guess it comes down to this: if you accept that the technology exists to target an earthquake, then one cannot deny the possibility (however remote) that this, or any other, is a result.  If you accept that people are able to have sabotaged the reactors more directly, then the possibility if it actually happening is also there.</p>

<p>It seems to me that there are those who stand to benefit from this disaster and they are, in large part, the same types of people who we would expect this type of thing from: callous disregard for value of human life and total focus on personal/group dominance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)Dunno, seems unnecessary.  I doubt that the political willpower required to overpower the gas+coal industry existed before this incident.</p>

<p>2)Absolutely.  The FED is, amazingly, actually under a bit of pressure due to the unholy alliance that is Fox News and the few conservative members of congress that are actually fiscally conservative.  I would not be surprised in the least if somewhere in the upper eschelons of power they quickly realized the cover that this would give them in pulling the trigger early on the 2nd bubble.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s why you put the question in the headline, because you WANTED people to read what you had said.</p>

<p>OH!</p>

<p>I must apologize for not reading your mind.</p>

<p>Match wits with you?  I accomplished that with my morning shit.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want people to answer a question put in your headline and instead read your &quot;ideas&quot; and THEN answer questions, next time you should try formulating a headline, then putting the questions at the END of your essay.</p>

<p>Now, we may not all have had basic composition coursework in high school.  I understand.  You might have been busy doing other things with your time instead of paying attention.</p>

<p>I get that.</p>

<p>However, now that you are an adult and interacting with other adults in the adult world, how about you show some class, intelligence, and ability to express yourself in a coherent manner instead of insisting that others read your mind?</p>

<p>Or were you just spouting bullshit to spout bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, an operation like this <em>would</em> take some degree of planning and intelligence gathering.  It <em>would</em> be difficult.  So would every single other conspiracy operation ever conducted.  I don&#39;t quite see your point.</p>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cause/wait for earthquake</li>
<li>Wait for Japanese to ask for U.S. military assistance</li>
<li>Enter nuclear reactor building under guise of assistance, plant explosive</li>
<li>GTFO, detonate, blame Hydrogen gas</li>

<p>As far as conspiracies go, this has got to be one of the easiest.</p>

<li>Why not?  It&#39;s a pretty big coincidence to me that Obama is just trying to unveil an energy plan that includes nuclear power, and then a catastrophe involving nuclear power hits Japan, and then the news media talks about nothing else other than whether nuclear safe is truly safe enough after all.</li>
<li>Correct, but neither have we hit the bottom.  We busted ourselves out of the mortgage crisis by bailing it out with an even bigger Ponzi scheme: the U.S. economy.  So while we&#39;re still recovering from one, we are just waiting for a much more massive hammer to drop.</li>
