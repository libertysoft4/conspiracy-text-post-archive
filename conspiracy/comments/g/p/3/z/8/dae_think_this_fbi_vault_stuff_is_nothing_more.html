        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So far, I don&#39;t know of anything important actually being released from it.  I see a bunch of documents being released which are basically just reports of what people told them, and not any of their actual findings.</p>

<p>To me it just seems like the FBI is trolling.  Am I wrong?  Has anything of substance been released?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Looks like I&#39;m not alone.  Please, when you submit FBI Vault stuff, make sure that the FBI is endorsing the findings and it&#39;s not merely a report of what someone told them.  I want some breaking stuff to come out as much as the next guy... but if we keep submitting stuff that carries no water, no one is going to click stuff from vault.fbi.gov anymore no matter how good the submission is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>two objectives.</p>

<p>one, create a sort of &quot;playing field&quot; wherein events which help progress the agenda of UFO disclosure can <em>appear</em> to be unfolding naturally. Basically like <em>laying soil</em> for more psy-op bullshit, if a metaphor helps you understand the idea.</p>

<p>two, <em>specifically</em> help convince people the transparency professed by the FBI is disingenuous by <em>deliberately</em> releasing documents readers are likely to believe are irrelevant, incomplete, or altogether inaccurate. What this does is help foster the suspicion and distrust which will incline audiences to investigate and believe material <em>distinctly</em> in <em>opposition</em> to what the original releases claim.</p>

<p>read this slowly if you have to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nailed it.  Let&#39;s not forget that, before Hoover, the FBI actually did a fair job of prosecuting intrastate crime rings (I&#39;m an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarchism">autarchist</a>, loosely speaking).  Since, the only significant evidence is that the FBI is depicted as dickless fools compared to the CIA/NSA.  Not too hard to figure out, then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a UFO believer, I saw a UFO with my family and neighbors long time ago in Romania. Now I live in US and I really think it is possible that the US government doesn&#39;t have anything on UFOs. The US government is too incompetent and too ignorant of the real issues, so probably they, just like the media, made a decision to ignore anything about UFOs and ridicules anyone who brings the subject up. This could extend all the way to FBI. FBI for sure received reports of UFOs, but its possible they just shelved them and ignored them (and now release stuff that they shelved for years), who knows. Just look how incompetent are the people up there, do you think people like McCain or Romney or Lieberman give a fuck about UFOs? I could be wrong, but I think there is a strong possibility that the incompetent people that run this country ignored the subject.</p>

<p>&quot;A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout">limited hangout</a>, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details. It takes the form of deception, misdirection, or coverup often associated with intelligence agencies involving a release or &quot;mea culpa&quot; type of confession of only part of a set of previously hidden sensitive information, that establishes credibility for the one releasing the information who by the very act of confession appears to be &quot;coming clean&quot; and acting with integrity; but in actuality, by withholding key facts, is protecting a deeper operation and those who could be exposed if the whole truth came out. In effect, if an array of offenses or misdeeds is suspected, this confession admits to a lesser offense while covering up the greater ones.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I am sure, but describing why is a bit longer than I want to type.  When you get a solid grasp on what the real truth is, it becomes very easy to notice when folks are stroking a particular angle.  Camelot pushes the old/new age wisdom line, much like Project World Awareness pushes the new age higher consciousness line, just as Pindz pushes the alien invasion line.</p>

<p>Closer to the truth is that fascism is a sickness in any culture, and since WWII the Nazis and their American benefactors have used the M.I.C. to further their agenda underground.  Antigrav was patented in &#39;53 bt T. T. Brown, telepathy is the source of the all-seeing eye and swastika memes, and all over America there are communities (Roanoke, TX; Sedona, AZ) of these Nazi/Luciferians living together and &quot;enjoying&quot; what is approaching the &quot;hive mind&quot; you&#39;ll be hearing a lot about.</p>

<p>Any time you hear &quot;aliens are coming&quot; it&#39;s 100% either intentional disinfo or useful idiots.  It&#39;s the Nazis, or better: a cabal of willful servants for the so-called &quot;ancient kings&quot;.</p>

<p>Not really, because none of the limited hangouts are willing to discuss it.  But you might check out <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/">VigilantCitizen</a> which, by virtue of focusing on modern media, ends up showing where we are now, which we could only have arrived at if the vector of the memetic virus were the wiccan &gt; mystery schools &gt; templars &gt; masons &gt; nazis lineage.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s kinda hard to miss when a witch, a mason, and a geriatric German sit you down and offer you $5mil for keeping your mouth shut.  True story.</p>
