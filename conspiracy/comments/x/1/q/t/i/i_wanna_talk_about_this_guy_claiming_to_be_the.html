    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible that James Holmes was set up? Think about this:
James Holmes goes out Tuesday night drinking and someone doses him. They do it early Wed morning so they have time in his apartment to set up those elaborate traps (how would James have known how to construct those anyway?)
They keep him drugged and off the radar till Thursday night when they go to the theater. They make sure to park in that spot, right next to the exit of the theater.
The assailant goes in, fakes the phone call, comes out, goes to the car where James is still drugged, gets the gear on, goes in and attacks the innocent civilians.
Then the assailant comes out the exit door, leans against it while dropping the gun and removing almost all of his gear with the exception of the mask.
He runs past the car dropping the gear next to it in a heap, opens the door with James inside, tosses the guns into the car, the shotgun has been there all along, and goes straight down the length of the building toward the corner, toward the camera, drops his mask directly under the camera, and heads off to the nearby street where a car is waiting (cruising slowly) to pick him up.
Holmes is reported to have been “meek” when arrested. This might also explain why he wasn’t shot by police… he was incapacitated, incoherent, or generally not a threat.
Holmes, who is being held under suicide watch in solitary confinement, remained in his murderous “Joker” persona after his arrival, a jailhouse worker told the Daily News.“He thinks he’s acting in a movie,” a prison employee told the Daily News.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, ok, let me rephrase this, this is not how the media works, people might remember to a certain extent, but they remember about as far as the media tells them what to think.  The next story line, the next celebrity gossip, the next jobs disappointment, the next financial scandal, the next corrupt politician, the next sports moment, im not sure you even know how the media works, maybe you should study MSM tactics and understand that first, i dont have all night to teach you the basics of media manipulation and succeeding as a media empire.  But ill finish by saying, this story will stop selling ads in a few days, let me educate you some more real quick before i leave, tv works because of advertisements once again incase you didnt understand the first time, this story will get stagnate and wont entertain in a couple more days.  Most people who watch MSM and get their influence from MSM, will be fed the next story line that will sell the most advertisements, hence the olympics will be front and center and more important to the bottom line of MSM in 4 days. </p>

<p>Sorry for sounding like a noob, but that astounds me.  I can understand for a light machine gun... but a rifle?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but they are cheap construction and notorious for jamming. AR-15s can have very quick magazine changes with a little practice, plus the weight of the drum limits mobility and accuracy of the firearm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Granted I&#39;m going on what I&#39;ve read and heard. I may be wrong. </p>

<p>My only retort is that the explosives he made in the fashion he made them in would have taken at least 2 months to learn to build.  </p>

<p>buys $10,000 of military weapons, equipment, and explosives in a 2 month span</p>

<p>Credit cards</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no experience with firearms and denied access to gun range</p>

<p>He played paintball.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bombs baffle local SWAT bomb squad and they had to bring in the FBI disposal team, who said that it was &quot;the most sophisticated booby trap&quot; that they had ever seen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect the local SWAT team is more used to blowing up people&#39;s back packs &amp; mail packages.  It probably doesn&#39;t take more than that to scare them off, especially when they couldn&#39;t take a robot through the front door.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wearing full body armor and carrying several guns</p>

<p>These guys did it too. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout</a></p>

<p>He came to an event with lots of crowds &amp; costumes, had his car parked right outside the exit to get his guns &amp; any other equipment he wanted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>someone lets him into the theater</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was him. He propped the exit door open. He exited the theater to his car to get his guns &amp; other equipment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>see answering phone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was his cover up to the audience so they would think he had a real reason to exit the movie theater and not look suspicious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shots in the background of 911 calls confirm controlled bursts, and double taps with the pistol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He played paintball. I bet you learn to conserve your ammo when playing that game too.</p>

<p>And I am sure it is 2 weeks to a month to many other legislative efforts. Find a time when nothing is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such an interesting list, I had to switch to my computer to comment, So $10,000 worth of gear? yeah VERY suspicious. I didn&#39;t hear he was denied from the gun range, and can&#39;t fathom why ( they don&#39;t even check your ID depending on where you go) could you tell me more about that? I&#39;m with you, what student is going to know how to build explosives? especially such sophisticated ones? NONE that&#39;s who. Ever tried to make explosives? unless you&#39;re lucky or good, you&#39;re likely to blow your hand off If you are just reading it online. or at least alert the neighbors with the weird smells, and small test charge explosions coming from your place. very interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, in regards to being turned away at a range there are only a couple of possibilities I know of.  if you are alone and have to rent because you do not have your own gun (anti-suicide measure) and if you appear to be intoxicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of these are speculation and some of them are just plain wrong...</p>

<p>This guy would have gotten more than enough money to pay for this stuff because he was a PhD student.</p>

<p>I love how him being a Neuroscience student means he can&#39;t be a psychopath.</p>

<p>Jim Carrey is undeniably depressed and he&#39;s a comedian.</p>

<p>Not everything makes perfect sense, this is life.</p>
