    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you offer to me suggests everything would be in order.</p>

<p>But since you ask I wouldn&#39;t mind mixing it in with my project of learning python programming.   I&#39;m not too far in my progress (chapt 16 python the hard way) but am starting to feel I could probably write something to automate the audit.  Don&#39;t worry if the mods do not want to allow the temp. mod access as this will be an interesting mini project to get my head working.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you know when I am ready and would anticipate needing only a short promotion to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re removing perfectly rational content from a subreddit dedicated to content like this because you might get made fun of by a subreddit full of people who don&#39;t even acknowledge facts that are fully documented? And that&#39;s okay because the censorship in this subreddit is readily available in another, less popular subreddit? Makes perfect sense. How about you reserve your power for when it&#39;s actually necessary, rather than when people post things you personally don&#39;t agree with. And whether or not you feel that the website is legitimate, doesn&#39;t give you the authority to remove content that others might find interesting. All he&#39;s presented are the facts, which are open to interpretation. Whether or not it turns out to be true is completely irrelevant. Keep your opinions to yourself, and try not to silence the opinions of others in the future. Even if you&#39;re afraid a community of scared children might mock you. That&#39;s the entire point of the subreddit. All we ever see is mockery. If one day we come to the conclusion that 80% of the information on this subreddit was incorrect, (which it possibly is), I would be more proud to be a part of a rational discussion about subjects which don&#39;t get enough attention that turn out to be incorrect, than a part of a discussion moderated by people who have the same amount of information as me and decide to censor opinions they disagree with. Also, maybe you should edit your rules to include &quot;7. NOTHING I THINK ISN&#39;T TRUE&quot;. And if you want to see less of this, take your own advice and downvote it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well let&#39;s start with the fact that I was banned for the post you just responded to. Do you genuinely feel that was warranted? Because it doesn&#39;t feel that my criticism is allowed. Apparently what I wrote warrants me being called a &quot;fucking moron&quot; by the moderator. I&#39;m pleased that you&#39;re ready and willing to accept constructive criticism. He however is not. Apparently his comment about how we should downvote things we don&#39;t want to see only applies to us lowly people, considering he gets to simply remove content he disagrees with, and ban people who question him in a perfectly rational and respectful manner.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you remove anyone who disagrees with you. You just banned me for literally no reason. And the community saw it happen. Nice going. Really smooth. And as for your idiotic statement regarding whether or not I know what you remove, you claim in your <strong>very own original post</strong> that you remove things based on the way the community will be viewed, in order to &quot;represent the community in the best way possible.&quot; You know who best represents the community? <strong>the community</strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>No. I was already aware of that. Was it so hard replying once without insulting me? You make it seem difficult. The original submission isn&#39;t the issue anymore.  I wasn&#39;t afraid you were a part of an illuminatic conspiracy to keep us from figuring out about one website with sub par information. I just think you don&#39;t know how to effectively deal with the opinions of others. You don&#39;t seem to be trying to hide that fact, though. Is there a reason you removed the OP&#39;s second submission, banned him, me, and at least two other people from the subreddit for respectfully disagreeing with you? I assumed moderators were here to moderate discussion. Not regulate the userbase to suppress dissent.</p>

<p>Seems to me that you and SovereignMan fit most of the characteristics. Continually trying to discredit me, ignore what I&#39;m presenting, and changing the subject to something with no relation to the topic at hand. This post is not about me, and I won&#39;t let you guys rile me up. I have replied to all attempts to do so. I stand by what I have presented, and I am hopeful that others will at least pay a little more attention.  I can deal with the downvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So our authorities can&#39;t be trusted, and a subreddit like this is necessary to expose corruption. Therefore the word of the moderators is final and should be trusted fully? I don&#39;t even agree with dummyaccnt and what you&#39;re saying is absolutely ludicrous. People post here about the ruling elite taking DMT to communicate with reptilian aliens and prepare for the anti-christ, and he posts that one website might be spamming, and gets removed? This wasn&#39;t even remotely suspicious until moderator actions were taken. 9000sins thinks <em>this</em> is what we&#39;re being mocked for? Good joke. The website in question has tons of great submissions to the website. It doesn&#39;t mean that the moderator has the right to remove a post about corruption within a subreddit dedicated to exposing corruption, and it certainly doesn&#39;t mean he should be vilified. Not that you care about logical reason, As is obvious by what you just said. He shouldn&#39;t post anything that he finds suspicious if the person in control of the subreddit assures you that it isn&#39;t suspicious? How many people do you think you&#39;re actually fooling?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy activeposts stuff.  And as for it being spammy, during an entire week, i see maybe 3 or 4 articles reach about 30-60 votes (enough to get noticed).  Plus, to me, not sure how accurate, but it doesnt seem that they recycle stories, i feel their content is pretty good and some effort is put into putting out legit content.  Not ground breaking, but none the less, good.  jmho.</p>

<p>You mods are doing a good job at keeping this subreddit legit (9000sins is cool), i feel there will be more concerted efforts to discredit or see more active methods to try to lure the good redditors on r/conspiracy into leaving, ie: bashing, mis-direction, burying threads/comments,  change of subject, personal attacks to try and bring r/conspiracy to a less attractive sub-reddit.  You see a lot of these techniques used in the penny stock forums, most are very effective to mess with the noob investor...if you dont know what youre looking for you can easily find yourself questioning being here.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work and there are enough solid thinkers/awakened minds on r/conspiracy, think most of them can hold their own pretty good. There are lots of new subscribers on this subreddit though, ive noticed, so got to stay on your toes.</p>
