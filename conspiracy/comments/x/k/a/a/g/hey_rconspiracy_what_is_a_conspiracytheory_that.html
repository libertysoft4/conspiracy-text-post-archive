<p>1:  Manhattan was purchased for well of 3,000 pounds sterling in guns and supplies.  Please don&#39;t perpetuate myths of the ignorant native.</p>

<p>2:  Tribes were always at war.  To some tribes the white man was just adding an extra advantage. Read into how cortes captured Mexico with just 3,000 men.  Most of his help came from local natives.</p>

<p>You realize that is complete BS right?  Native American tribes fully understood the concept of ownership. What they didn&#39;t get was concept of owning land after you die, as in having land in an &quot;estate&quot;.  And by &quot;not get it&quot; I mean they just thought it was stupid. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t perpetuate myths that natives were backwards and incapable of understanding western values.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.landandfreedom.org/ushistory/us1.htm">http://www.landandfreedom.org/ushistory/us1.htm</a></p>

<p>Edit: I wasn&#39;t perpetuating natives were backwards by any means. You&#39;re drawing inaccurate assumptions based on what I said. They philosophically had a different view of land ownership that was more based on &quot;land use&quot; than land ownership. Because of this, the idea of owning land wasn&#39;t even a possible idea according to their world view. You can&#39;t really own something that isn&#39;t yours; how could you own &quot;mother Earth?&quot; The concept of land ownership to them would be similar to air ownership to us. It has nothing to do with incompetence or incapability, it is about world-view. It&#39;s kind of like how a Westerner can&#39;t comprehend caste systems/social hierarchies in Hinduism or karma &amp; rebirth in Buddhism. For instance, many Great Lakes Region Indians believed that humans were created to harmoniously co-exist with spirits/animals in this world which provided the resources to us. The earth was just as much ours as it was the animals. Humans could take resources from the earth (animals/plants) as long as all of the plant/animal matters were used wastelessly. However, it was necessary to show gratitude to the spirits of these lifeforms after taking their life. If you could &quot;own land,&quot; you would in turn &quot;own&quot; the land that these other lifeforms have equal claims to, and that&#39;s not possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any links off the top of my head, or time to compile some sources for you (if there are any, it&#39;s useually a very two sided issue: either they went, or it was faked), but there were a total of 6 landings on the moon and 12 people who did various things while there over the course of 41 months. I am sure that the amount of resources spent on something of this magnitude was not just to show off and one-up the Russians. I think they staged some of the footage because they were busy looking for/doing something that we have never been privy too. That&#39;s pretty much all I got, but then again, if I had a smoking gun it wouldn&#39;t be much of a conspiracy theory eh?</p>

<p>I totally believe the Eyes Wide Shut conspiracy angle, btw.  Everyone says the movie is about sex, guilt, love--not to me.  That film had a strong, consistent subtheme of <em>class,</em> with a heavy pointed finger to the Illuminati and their ritual sex whatever the fuck magik satanic evil thing they got goin&#39; on there (re: Sandusky FBI?!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t it be both?  If I were running the operation, I definitely would have a contingency plan (film the landing for a backup).  The entire operation was a PR stunt so it would make sense to invest in the <em>actual public relations perspective</em> considering it would only be a fraction of the real cost.  Maybe what we saw was a mix of filmed + real?</p>

<p>If only he put that amount of time and effort into debunking the officially endorsed 9/11 conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>The world would end, because he&#39;d have a &quot;debunking&quot; list longer than any of the others on that page - if you know anything about that day beyond what you&#39;ve read on FoxNews or CNN, then you know that&#39;s true. Whether it matters enough to you to grow the fuck up and realize you don&#39;t have the answer is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>So you are saying none of the conspiracy theorist put enough time into debunking the endorsed 9/11 theory? Because afaik the world is not endning. Well, thats not the skeptics fault, thats your fault my friend. </p>

<p>And I have read and watched many many hours of conspiracy theories when I believed it. Then I watched and read hours and hours of skeptics proving those theories wrong. With science and evidence. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to have any answers, I just encourage you to go check for yourself. I don&#39;t even live in America, so I never watch Fox or CNN. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking. As far as you go, you&#39;re a joke to me, because you won&#39;t even use the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; accurately in a sentence - instead opting to &#39;believe in&#39; the popular culture version of it.</p>

<p>&quot;the endorsed 9/11 theory&quot; IS A CONSPIRACY THEORY. THAT&#39;S THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT JESUS CHRIST, ALLAH, KRISHNA, OR WHOEVER - it&#39;s a small group of wealthy, dominant men who are representing even more wealthy, dominant men who are a smaller club because they do not need to stand for elections(<em>as they fund the campaigns of and as such Select those who will be Elected</em>) - when they officially endorse a conspiracy theory, <em>it&#39;s still a conspiracy theory</em>.</p>

<p>Kind of like the official explanation regarding the Gulf of Tonkin incident ..it was a conspiracy theory - officially endorsed for decades - given to the masses via the mainstream media and higher levels of government - which ended up being used to kill hundreds of thousands of people, and tens of thousands of Americans in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Guess what - turned out it <em>never even happened</em>. That&#39;s an &quot;officially endorsed&quot; conspiracy theory that everyone &quot;believed in&quot; that turned out to be completely false and silly, and it was entirely proven wrong later.</p>

<p>But, you know, like every other generation - everyone seems to think that theirs is different, their government is different than every other government in human history, people today are different than people of every other time in history as far as conspiring together for mutual gain in circumstances which must be concealed from the public - that that could never happen today(kind of like THAT generation believed about their world and THEIR government) - and it&#39;s the most absurd, childish thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. </p>

<p>We already have &quot;shown you something&quot; - things that are admitted and not disputable, instead you choose to ignore those things <em>which paint a large picture</em>, <em>provide context for</em>, and <em>frame issues that follow in the same light, in the same society, using the same mechanisms, to the same result within the same society</em> - and focus in on this little pixel of it going &quot;well if, you can&#39;t prove a particular 9/11 conspiracy theory then maybe I would <em>believe</em>&quot; ..you&#39;re small-minded, I&#39;m not.

<p>No, I&#39;m not accusing anyone, that&#39;s what you&#39;re not getting. If someone gives you a theory which asserts and claims to explain a conspiracy, and the proof provided is insufficient, flawed, or obviously does not explain the event, then that is all that is necessary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s what you yourself are doing with every other conspiracy theory you come across - just not the government&#39;s - because somehow, those people and those institutions(which I have shown you with &quot;this and that&quot;[as in, provable, factual historical events and non-events which led to major societal changes, corporate profits, and tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths] are entirely untrustworthy - and who have shown THEMSELVES to be entirely untrustworthy, like Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Bush Jr, and the rest of those titled corporate mafiosos) have the godlike power to get you to just look the other way on something that had a major effect on a major society.</p>

<p>3,000 people dead, murdered - cops, firemen, women, child,  3 large buildings, 2 airplanes, and people working at the pentagon. Luckily, all the department heads were on the precise opposite side of the building, and the single section that was hit had recently finished renovations making it the ONLY side of the pentagon built to withstand blasts, contain missile explosions structurally, etc. - all that was taken out was the side of the building where records were kept - a single day after the Secretary of Defense went on the mainstream news and announced that there were trillions missing ..unaccounted for.. from the pentagon&#39;s budget - Rumsfeld admitted to $2.3 trillion missing on September 10, 2001).</p>

<p>You seem to be missing a pretty big point. Someone who doesn&#39;t believe what the government tells them about 9/11 doesn&#39;t need to suppose, present, and prove any alternative theory, detailing the who/where/when/how/why - all that is necessary is knowing that the officially offered conspiracy theory stands just as shakily as the rest of them, and cannot stand up to rigorous investigation even by laymen.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theory presented by the government as fact simply does not match or explain the evidence and actual facts of that day - if you have looked into conspiracy theories as much as you claim you have, then you know this is true regardless of whether or not you&#39;ve found any others you &quot;believe in&quot;. I can&#39;t make it any bolder, plainer, or larger. </p>

<p>No, you misunderstand(as you seem to constantly do), in a very schizophrenic, confused, angry way.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t accuse anyone. I made a statement of fact - that the highest brass in the building, at the pentagon, their offices were on the opposite side of the building, furthest from where the explosions and impact happened.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say &quot;george bush conducted 9/11 from his ranch in texas&quot; - if I had, the burden of proof would be on me. You&#39;re an idiot, in that you don&#39;t seem to understand that once a theory is disproved(OR WHEN IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL HOLES IN IT, AS THE OFFICIAL STORY DOES - if you don&#39;t know this, then you have not looked into it at all anywhere but the Popular Mechanics website), then that is all that is necessary.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to give you the name of the particular contributor of the NIST report who &quot;lied&quot;, I don&#39;t need to give you a time, date, list of conspirators, and room # of where it was planned out in - that&#39;s completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>The burden of proof rests with the people supposing the theory - that is the government - their theory has substantial holes in it, and if you do not know this, then you have not looked at the subject matter honestly or thoroughly - to the point where if it were presented in court by anyone else as a defense or alternative explanation for a crime they were accused of being complicit in(you know, <em>anyone or any institution/corporation who didn&#39;t have a monopoly on the use of force and violence</em>) they would be convicted ten times over.</p>

<p>The burden of proof was on them, they didn&#39;t prove their case. I don&#39;t need to provide an explanation of what happened. You&#39;re the one being ridiculous, because this is exactly what you do with every other conspiracy theory - just not the one given to you by the government.</p>

It doesn&#39;t take a structural engineer to tell you that two 110 story buildings and a 47 story steel skyscraper plummeting to the ground at nearly free-fall speed requires the assistance of explosives. All you need is two eyes that can see and a brain that thinks to come to that sound conclusion. This is why it is of my opinion that more emphasis should be placed on the &quot;who&quot; instead of the &quot;how&quot;. It should be obvious to anyone that discovering who did 9/11 is infinitely more important than discovering how they did it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second sentence of your link is complete bullshit. &#39;Lets not spend time actually proving any conspiracy, lets start hurling accusations at the jews, yay!&#39; </p>

<p>The &#39;almost free fall&#39; thing is one of the easiest things to disprove. The debree fell much faster than the tower itself, watch any video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you just tell me I have a skewed/zionist vision of reality? Okay bro. Your first link is so full of anti semitic crap and blatant lies. And I have a skewed vision of reality?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1979, twenty-one years before September 11, 2001, Isser Harel predicted with uncanny accuracy the events of 9-11 to Michael D. Evans, an American supporter of Zionist extremists of the Jabotinsky sort. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So 9/11 was actually planned before 1979.. Right. </p>

<p>Okay, I looked into those reports. Pretty interesting. But they don&#39;t actually prove anything. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>There was no witness statement that claimed the 5 men started taking pictures and/or filming before the attack happened. All witnesses only noticed the men after the plane had struck the first tower. 1 witness claimed he saw the van in the parking lot at 8.00 am. (p.34)</p></li>
<li><p>The 5 men did appear to be happy and smiling on the pictures they took within minutes after the plane hit the first tower. No video camera or video was found. (p.35)</p></li>
<li><p>They could be working for Israeli intelligence and using Urban Moving  systems as a cover. No proof though.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all this doesn&#39;t prove anything. Even if they are Mossad/Israeli intelligence, the reports do not prove they had any foreknowledge. 
As far as I know this is what the men said on the talkshow, where you claim they said they were &#39;anticipating an attack&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The fact of the matter is we are coming from a country that experiences terror daily. Our purpose was to document the event.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t tell anything about foreknowledge from that sentence. They documented the event like everyone else with a camera did on that day. </p>

A very nice fantasy, where you think you&#39;re very informed, probably love John Stewart and Steven Colbert(okay I love him too), think you&#39;d surely know it if something so bad had happened - and certainly, someone in congress would come out and tell you(<em>forgetting for your lifetime the fact that more than half of the officials appointed by the government to sit on the 9/11 Commission called it a coverup, as you probably have not read the books published by ANY OF THEM</em> some using those words verbatim - WHO THE FUCK ELSE WOULD YOU BE LOOKING FOR TO TELL YOU THAT IF NOT THE 9/11 COMMISSIONERS THEMSELVES?).. and if they don&#39;t, well then, everyone who doesn&#39;t have faith in YOUR shaky, sketchy conspiracy theory(the Bush administration&#39;s explanation for the events on 9/11) is just as crazy as those dictator-loving outrageous conspiracy theorists who tried to tell you that weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were propaganda and lies before we invaded and sent hundreds of thousands of kids(our kids ..straight out of the high school libraries and lunch rooms where there were military recruiters) into a wholly unnecessary meatgrinder out in the desert somewhere to kill and die, with an idiot like Bush hanging &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; banners 2 years into a decade long war. We&#39;re just as bad as they who tried to warn you back then, when every major media network was broadcasting the &quot;WMD&quot; story(while everyone in the intelligence community knew that the term &quot;terrorist&quot; was just an excuse for imperialism, but went along with it because hey, somebody&#39;s got to do it - somebody has got to be the world superpower, and if not us, then who?), when every high member of government was telling you to believe a lie, which someone, somewhere along the lines, had to know was a lie(do you REALLY think that the leaders of the most advanced, dominant, and aggressive nation on planet Earth are so ill-informed?).</p>

<p>You are extremely confused about the world, but you think that you&#39;re not. You believe absurdities, but think them very realistic and proper - you find the most unrealistic things to be appropriate explanations for events that change entire societies, because, well, seeing it any other way means re-evaluating your entire worldview, and that means losing whatever mental security you have left in the integrity of your leaders and your ruling class(and there most certainly IS a &#39;ruling class&#39;, and Obama is not part of it, he&#39;s just an employee).</p>

<p>You&#39;re wrong, and you&#39;re the one living in a fantasy world built on outrageous conspiracy theories, lies, obviously debunkable agenda-ridden propaganda, and the <em>desire to believe and keep on believing</em>. You just don&#39;t recognize it, because your conspiracy theories are the ones given to you on FoxNews or CNN, or by some member of the regime ruling the US(I don&#39;t mean Bush or Obama, I mean the big boys behind them - you know, the ones with all the money - the 1% who control 98% of the country&#39;s wealth - and have for decades and decades ..yeah, bud, they wouldn&#39;t do anything to perpetually maintain power, and they would never conspire to kill or harm anyone to remain or further their current positions).</p>

<p>Please grow up and face the world you&#39;re actually living in, because it&#39;s not the one you see on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... I see your point. I may have misinterpreted. Although, I&#39;ll explain how I read the OPs post. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>how many of us have been certain of something, maybe we told our friends, and then embarrassingly found out we couldn&#39;t be further from the actual truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the OP said, &quot;maybe we told our friends, and then embarrassingly ...&quot;, I interpreted that as the sharing of something other than an &quot;official explanation&quot;; thus why someone would be embarrassed after sharing.   </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be embarrassed sharing information that was being widely disseminated but I would/could be embarrassed sharing what many would consider &quot; a crazy, tin-foil hat claim&quot; and later not believing it myself.  </p>

I&#39;m not even sure it was allowed to happen, I think incompetence is more likely then malice. Of course they squeezed the event for all it&#39;s worth after the fact. Which is were I think the conspiring comes into play. It&#39;s a shame I find it so difficult to find conspiracy talk that doesn&#39;t cross the line into ludicrous. In fact it would be a clever way to spread seeds of doubt that some plausible conspiracy&#39;s probably didn&#39;t happen. Now that&#39;s a conspiracy I can get behind.

If it wasn&#39;t controlled in some way I feel like that would have been difficult to predict in a uncontrolled demo.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on Building 7, it really looks like a controlled demo and it wasn&#39;t hit by a plane.  Towers 1 &amp; 2 resemble a top-down demolition, but they were hit by giant fuckin planes... so I&#39;m willing to accept that <em>maybe</em> that&#39;s just what happens when a building gets hit really hard by something really big like that.  We don&#39;t really have many other examples to look at for comparison.  But #7, a building on fire that just pancakes into its own footprint without being struck... yeah.  I&#39;ve heard that the base of the building was kinda uneven due to some subway or some shit that runs under it... but I&#39;d think that it would fall to that side if that played a part.</p>

<p>I think a new investigation would be great... but it&#39;s one of those things that no matter the outcome, it still wouldn&#39;t be settled.</p>

<p>If it came to a similar conclusion as the 9/11 report, it would be labeled a whitewash.  If it came closer to the truther claims, a big segment of the population would still stand by the initial report, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the beautiful thing about actual conspiracy theories. There is no possible way to prove them right or wrong. They are vague enough to sound good with speculative evidence and hearsay with just enough fact to make it scary. Conspiracies are a matter of faith and personal opinion. That is why I love hearing them so much. It is interesting to me how people, depending on their personal bent on society see the world and the incidents that take place in it. But above all and most importantly they are a way for people to try to figure out truth in a way that makes sense to them. That is the way I see it anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the US is run either by Democrats out to get rid of the Republicans, or Republicans out to get rid of Democrats.

<p>One thing though that still strikes me as funny is that you can get people from the far left to do for free what those on the right must be highly paid to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US government-endorsed conspiracy theory regarding 9/11. Makes no sense(unless you people seriously believe the bullshit that &#39;oh the <em>free world</em> and most advanced, dominant, aggressive, wealthy nation on planet Earth is just run&#39;d by a bunch of poor nincompoops! dey just don&#39;t know wat they&#39;re doing! they r just poor politicians and dey just can&#39;t do anyting right! aw dey just can&#39;t get along! looks like we&#39;re just in a back and forth game between 2 parties that is unending and has gone on forever, hehehe&#39; ..you&#39;re living in a dream world, a fantasy that you have not thought through using the most important sense of all - reason), too much contradicting evidence, explains nothing, benefits all the right agendas - but hey, we all know the people who have been at the higher levels of the US government and major corporations would never do anything to hurt American citizens.</p>

<p>Fucking derp.</p>

<p>The real answer to your question is &quot;not a single one&quot;, because &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are not a matter of belief, if that&#39;s what they are for you, if you&#39;ve &quot;believed in&quot; a conspiracy theory, or somehow trusted in one that required your faith to &quot;believe&quot;, then you&#39;re doing it wrong - the worldview that dictates &quot;<em>believing</em> conspiracy theories is silly there are none&quot; is a matter of belief, and it&#39;s almost so insolently childish as to be ridiculous ..if only it weren&#39;t so widely held.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no need to buy into any theory, the only need is to recognize that the officially presented theories make no sense in light of this thing called &quot;evidence&quot;, like the JFK assassination, and that taking them on faith, taking them on patriotism, or &quot;well they wouldn&#39;t lie to me and surely if it wasn&#39;t true then someone would tell me&quot;(someone has told you, they&#39;re called &#39;conspiracy <em>theorist</em>&#39;) is the most ridiculous thing you could possibly do. The only thing that is required to be a wackjob &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is to believe in a conspiracy theory that doesn&#39;t match the actual available evidence ..so basically anyone who believed or broadcasted that Iraq had WMDS, anyone who believes the official theory regarding 9/11, anyone who believed the official story behind the Gulf of Tonkin incident which was used to involve America in the Vietnam War, anyone who believes the official theory regarding the JFK assassination.</p>

<p>When you STOP believing, that&#39;s when you realize &quot;oh wait, I don&#39;t really need to pick and believe in or have faith in one particular theory, that&#39;s irrelevant, what is relevant is that the officially-endorsed conspiracy theory does not match the evidence available surrounding the event or the subject at hand&quot; - that&#39;s what is important - because it means you&#39;re USING YOUR OWN MIND.</p>

The only thing that is required to be a wackjob &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is to believe in a conspiracy theory that doesn&#39;t match the actual available evidence</p>

<p>You see, discussing these kind of conspiracies that would make this place respectable. Not whether James Holmes was brainwashed by the CIA with scopolamine patches in order to ban guns in America. </p>
