<p>i apologize when i go on the attack and i find myself to be wrong, and did so quite frequently today. Nor do i intend to continue with that attitude, as i didn&#39;t really like the experience of trolling so hard.</p>

<p>Atleast i&#39;m trying to dispell misinformation, which i still did even with the oil fracking guy who used an outdated statistic and misrepresented the facts. One and a half out of three ain&#39;t bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We participate in this online community to gauge the human reaction to events, to debate our opinions, to sway others from harmful philosophy&#39;s on life, and to get facts straight.</p>

<p>Having said that, anybody who is paid to sway public opinions, or to dilute the truth of the matter, is detracting from the human experience in the name of greed. Without the possibility of having free thought, the process is pointless, and harmfull to society.</p>

<p>Doing something about it is the first step to a better internet, a better world. And it takes all kinds, even shills to run this convergence of multiple realities we call life, but they have their own format for bringing about change, and should stick to it. It&#39;s called lobying. Lobying politicians is one thing, but lobying people into believing and supporting a position or a belief that is not inherantly the best for said people, is just evil. And i&#39;ll fight to the death for my beliefs, i may not have money or many possesions, but i have values and ethics in lieu of those frivolous and meaningless things.</p>

<p>Atleast, this way, at the end of my life, i&#39;ll have no guilt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s now an entire industry, manipulating public images for companies, millitary propaganda, dispersing false information for the media..</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an imaginary foe, they are just invisible until we out them. Look at the topic you came in here to post about, what do you think it is about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>conspiracy has gotten nearly triple the viewers in the course of three years, this to me indicates a shift in the normal train of thought. With such an increase, we have also seen more and more of the old topics that would only fly here being reposted in politics, passing off in world news, and the like.</p>

<p>This ain&#39;t no backwater board anymore. It&#39;s become vital to the process. It&#39;s only natural that the place where truth is hinted at would be selectively targetted, hence again, the topic we are posting in.</p>

<p>The current debate is about the watering down of quality, a ploy at misdirection. A way to turn the populace away from this place. Somebody is afraid of this place. I&#39;ve seen really shitty posts here lately, as compared to last year when firms just started hiring the shills.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certain this shit hole has plenty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. The real danger of Alex Jones is that he makes people who sincerely question the truth look like kooks because they&#39;ll be associated with him.</p>

<p>He&#39;s so absurd though that only young people or those that are useless could really fall for his drivel. I mean when I was like 21 or something I didn&#39;t yet realize he was full of shit but a few years later and it&#39;s quite obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably depends on who he&#39;s talking to.</p>

<p>His stories are real and the plight is real. The rich are out for power and control.</p>

<p>Then people ask &quot;Why? Aren&#39;t they happy with what they got?&quot;</p>

<p>Then he goes &quot;No, they want total control over us and probably to wipe us out&quot;</p>

<p>Then you go &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So they can be exclusive on the planet&quot;</p>

<p>Then you go &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>Then he says:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Because they&#39;re horrible people who live in a bubble and don&#39;t see beyond their world and have long since been able to grasp the concept of &quot;other people&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Because there&#39;s basically 4 or 5 guys are the top who are overall trying to be the only one to hold the brass ring.</p></li>
<li><p>They&#39;re aliens/lizard people who want to control the earth for it&#39;s resources for their alien race.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically the conspiracy needs and end and when shit is this bad/crazy you need some big crazy reason why it&#39;s all happening.</p>

<p>I think a lot of Alex Jones articles are well sourced and true but when they start trying to figure out the elite&#39;s end game that&#39;s when you need to know you&#39;re listening to speculation.</p>

Assist in passing the UN small arms ban
Put TSA in malls and other places
Shows how movies are used for MK U ltra hitmen triggers 
And on and on and on. 
While there are always tidbits of true info Alex Jones is a loose cannon and an actor who is good for a laugh. As a person who truely feels that there are hidden agendas i find Alex Jones a liability. </p>

<p>You have to look into stuff for yourself, read all the boring books published by world leaders of societies and foundations that are actively working for globalisation. usually they talk pretty straight forward about how they predict the future and the direction they will lead the heards.

Of course this is true, but it does not help to keep saying that without naming these people and the crimes they commit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A large number of you believe the shit that Alex Jones spews.  He&#39;s VERY popular.  You can&#39;t write it off as being only &quot;disinfo agents&quot; that post - that&#39;s just dishonest.  You don&#39;t get to have this community, and then claim that any member of it who seems crazier than you isn&#39;t genuine in their beliefs.  You&#39;ve got some serious insanity in this community, own up to it.  </p>

<p>People upvote guys like tttt0tttt and bumblingmumbling who actually believe that Jews control the entire world and aren&#39;t allowed to be criticized, despite the fact that they spend their entire day criticizing Jews.  They&#39;re <em>very</em> popular posters on this subreddit.  But they say crazy things.  Who are <em>you</em> to decide if they&#39;re &#39;shills&#39; or nutbags?  Why is it that assumed that anyone who says something crazy must ACTUALLY be lying, rather than, you know, crazy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is working three fronts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shouting and screaming half-truths to keep people under educated in a shroud of fear, advocating physical resistance and giving the false idea of winning the battle against &#39;evil&#39;.</li>
<li><p>Selling gold. Ted Anderson sells gold in his show and owns gcn radio network. He is not helping people prepare for a market collapse because gold is not going to be worth anything after the economy plunges. </p></li>
<li><p>The thing he does best is he makes himself and others that believe in him look like a fool. He loses his cool all the time and acts like a lunatic especially when his information gets too close to the truth. He does a shitty job at backing his claims. All in all he makes it very hard for the people that believe him to talk to others about these very important topics without sounding like a &#39;conspiracy nut&#39;.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I was fooled by him myself for a while until I realized that he was simply playing at my emotions without educating me about the real problem or what to do about it. He himself IS cointelpro, he IS project mockingbird, he IS part of the problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kpfa.org/guns-and-butter">Guns &amp; Butter</a> Guns and Butter (once a week 1hour,  mostly geopolitics or conspiracy-related)
Usually the host Bonny Faulkner interviews a guest, but sometimes lectures or documentaries are broadcast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/UNWELCOME_GUESTS">Unwelcome Guests</a> Unwelcome Guests (once a week 2 hours, interviews and lectures on various topics) A collective presents a mixture of interviews, readings, lectures and documentaries. Usually the episodes are issue-specific, but sometimes the host reads from a book in more than one episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blackopradio.com/">BlackOpRadio - mostly about JFK</a> Usually the host Len Osanic interviews one or more guests on his show. Jim DiEugenio acts as co-host and answers JFK-questions from the audience. He also presents new research in the JFK-community.</p>

<p><a href="http://scotthorton.org/">The Scott Horton Show</a> Scott Horton sometimes likes to bash conspiracy theorists and I am no fan of his libertarian philosophy, but he has lots of interesting guests and I think he is a very good interviewer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe a better question would be: &quot;what do you want to know?&quot;</p>

<p>If it&#39;s simply &quot;what&#39;s going on today&quot; then decide &quot;where&quot;. Locally? Nationwide? Wordly? Does it really apply to you? Do you need to know?</p>

<p>To be honest, I hardly watch or read the news. The stuff I really need to know will get to me when it needs to. There are a lot of topics that I research every day and every day is different. When I research a topic, I spend as much time on it as needed until there are no more questions left. If I can&#39;t find the answer to something, I will carry it around for a while (sometimes years) and eventually there will always be an answer. </p>

<p>After doing your own research for a while you will get a nose for the truth and you won&#39;t need someone else to tell you what you need to know.</p>

<p>he acts funny when folks mention zionism. he is the high profile mouthpiece of the truth movement. it&#39;s too weird and his influence is too large for it to remain unconsidered. a lot of what he claims is well researched, and is even true at times, but a standard method of information management is to reveal almost all of the truth of an idea, enough to be observably worthy of trust, yet concealing or omitting or distorting a crucial fact. this effect, to me, seems most useful when occluding the ultimate head of a cryptocratic power structure, or a conspiracy that is becoming unraveled, a la mob history. IMO.</p>

Listening to Alex will make you think they are 80% of the whole problem and own almost the whole world. Exposing Bohemian grove was nice but because of his reputation, almost nobody believes it. Do you really believe they would &#39;mock&#39; human sacrifice? That&#39;s what they do at the county fair, you don&#39;t need a secret grove for that.</p>

He&#39;s a major gate keeper for Israel on the 9/11 front. His mantra &quot;9/11 is an inside job&quot; distracts away from Israel and focuses solely on US government.

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know, that&#39;s a good question. I&#39;ve listened to a few people who have radio shows like <a href="http://deadlinelive.info/">Jack Blood</a>, <a href="http://noliesradio.org/">Christopher Bollyn</a>, Kevin Barret and others ...they&#39;re OK...and interesting at best. My search for a &quot;radio&quot; show pretty much stopped. I gave up. I have found out of all of the so called truthers, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPLU4N7gmY4">Alan Sabrosky</a> is by far the ballsiest and most qualified of them all to tell what actually took place on 9/11 from a geopolitical standpoint (my interest). He has many writings on the subject as well as interviews.</p>

<p>i honestly want to know if my attention is being misdirected by jones. most information claiming so, of the handful of sources i have found, is grasping at straws. (though admittedly this may be a piece should the puzzle exist)</p>

<p>does anybody have something at least a tiny bit more difficult to explain away? i honestly think i am judging this information without a sheeples normalcy bias perspective but is there something i&#39;m missing? please help</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone intentionally omits the truth, they become suspect.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the Israel, along with a cabal of Zionist and Neocon collaborators within the US, plotted and carried out the attacks on September 11th.</p>

<p>Any amount of objective research regarding these claims proves this beyond a reasonable doubt.  Jones only serves to distract from this truth.</p>

<p>He is an agitator, a self proclaimed Zionist, and a shill.</p>

<p>The government is making us look like crazy fucks by using complex disinformation techniques on a relatively obscure website on a small subreddit!  </p>

<p>Ironically, this post is making everyone looks like crazy fucks. </p>

<p>A simpler explanation is that conspiracy theories generally attract crazy fucks because they require a high level of faith and a low level of proof. </p>

<p>The government doesn&#39;t need to discredit conspiracy theorists, they do it to themselves.  This subreddit is proof of that.  </p>

<p>but I do agree people buy into absolutely anything... like some are so fucking stupid they believe that some people are lizard, like come on...how fucking stupid does someone have to be to believe that shit...</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing about conspiracies, they&#39;re not fact based but faith based.  So really it&#39;s all up to how much you want to believe.  You can believe I&#39;m just a skeptic, or you can believe I&#39;m some sort of reptoid neozionist scumbag.  It&#39;s not up to me, it&#39;s up to you.

    <div class="md"><p>Easy there bud my point still applies.  Stooges are stooges and you obviously believe there&#39;s a conspiracy to dilute this sub.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing: conspiracies are all faith based, so in the end it&#39;s what you believe that shapes your reality, not facts.  </p>

<p>Like I said previously, you can believe I&#39;m just a skeptic, or you can believe I&#39;m some sort of reptoid neozionist scumbag. It&#39;s not up to me, it&#39;s up to you. How badly do you want to validate your worldview?</p>

<p>Do you see how believing in stooges flooding a obscure sub and an off beat website is just as dumb as believing in aliens and reptoids?  It&#39;s all faith based, and in the end that&#39;s moronic.  </p>

<p>No, the only people who say that are rational human beings that understand the true nature of conspiracy theories: they&#39;re faith based, not fact based.</p>

<p>Thus it&#39;s ironic that all sorts of &quot;evidence&quot; is produced which doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s more akin to a religion, not a science.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did it ever occur to you that people that disagree with you might just have different opinions and probably aren&#39;t in the payroll of the US govt?  I&#39;ve never understood the idea that because someone posts something that&#39;s contrary to your belief system it automatically makes them some sort of NWO stooge.  </p>

<p>A far more likely scenario is that they actually disagree with you.  You&#39;re not getting down votes because of some neo zionist conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Posts like this further discredit a subset of the population that already has legitimacy issues.  If you want people to believe what you believe, dismissing everyone as &quot;shills&quot; is probably a bad tactic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is, by the way, the single most common disagreement received when anyone starts talking about shills, and is basically a conjuring of the rational spirit, which also conveniently is often used to set up an additional opportunity to discredit or insult the larger &#39;group,&#39; defined here as conspiracy theorists. Which I see you also took advantage of. </p>

<p>Well done. </p>

<p>Posts like this do no benefit for anyone by generalizing folks and their social experience levels. Using instances of socially inept &#39;conversations&#39; to attack the broad field of conspiracy theories is crap.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author)</a></p>

<p>Mark Lane wrote <em>the very first book</em> questioning the JFK assassination.  He was a &quot;leader&quot; in advocating a JFK conspiracy for years.</p>

<p>Years later:  Lane was an attorney for James Earl Ray.  He spread disinformation throughout the House Special Committee on Assassinations.</p>

<p>And then:  Lane took a key witness in the MLK assassination case to Jonestown (yes, <em>that</em> Jonestown), so that key witness was unable to testify before Congress.</p>

<p>And then:  Lane was paid $6000/month by Jim Jones &amp; the Peoples&#39; Temple to accuse the CIA of attacking Jonestown, when in fact Jim Jones had circumstantial ties to the CIA.</p>

<p>And then:  The Jonestown Massacre killed the key witness, interrupted the House Special Committee on Assassinations (one day after Atlanta FBI agents testified that the Atlanta FBI office celebrated MLK&#39;s assassination).  But Lane miraculously survived.</p>

<p>To this day, Mark Lane is respected by many ignorant JFK assassination activists.  And he continues to spread disinformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s money in selling the outrageous, why do you think Alex Jones has been able to have the career he has or the National Inquirer still exists? It&#39;s two fronts:</p>

<p>Alex Jones sells fear, his sponsors (mainly gold-sellers, army surplus, and survival gear) benefit financially from the fearful. The more fear he can pedal the better for his bottom line. </p>

<p>On the other hand, people like those behind Sorcha Faal or the National Inquirer sell the outrageous as entertainment, they make sensational claims involving all sorts of dis/mis-information to grab the readers attention and get them to buy their books/magazines. </p>

<p>On top of all that you have the old conspiracy theorists/skeptic mantra of &quot;question everything&quot; people attracted to this kind of stuff want to believe there&#39;s more happening that what seems apparent, thus the outrageous is given equal voice as the possible or plausible. </p>

<p>In short it shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone that enjoys this kind of stuff(me included) that there are people who willfully act as megaphones for the Jones&#39; and Faals of the world in hope that the sensational bullshit they push has some basis in reality.</p>

<p>Which, by the way, from the way you guys describe it, would be a horribly boring job that apparently thousands of people are being paid to do.

    <div class="md"><p>I bother posting because I believe in trying to reveal how irrational the logic of a lot of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is.  It often lacks a scientific method.  It often lacks a nuance for the degrees of certainty in its truth claims.  I chose my handle because I believe a preponderance of the communities on the internet have now become isolated absolutist communities.  The extent to which people stay and choose to be isolated will determine the level of despair, discontent, and friction within my country.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care to make people look like idiots.  I want to engage people where I think they are misled.  The Western world thrived on a competition of ideas.  Within institutions and academies, ideas could be reasoned, challenged, and studied.  Proponents of alternate realities/ viewpoints used to not be villified or demonized.  Now you have designed formal epistemological categories for classes of people (Sliders/disinfo agents/politburo whatevers) that make you not have to acknowledge or engage competing truth claims.  I.e. if someone denies that they are in one of these categories it proves that they are in the category.  The only appropriate self-categorization for someone who disagrees with you apparently is apathy or a resigned nihilism.  Which is ironic, because many of the conspiracy arguments is that all of the problems exist because there are so many disinterested, apathetic people.</p>

<p>I believe that we (America mostly) have devolved as a community that cannot engage with people who hold competing views.</p>

<p>Are you kidding? Is that <em>not</em> what is happening when people call someone a conspiracy theorist? </p>

<p>An honest question: have you considered that there are shills who <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1898687/pg1">act</a> like &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; to reinforce the &#39;tard meme? To my mind, both sides of the field are being played, and that is really the only way to do it.

<p>If you&#39;re speaking of their comments regarding Zionists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They hardly say a word about Zionists. Mostly they talk about Jews, because they can&#39;t or won&#39;t recognize the difference. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jew&#39;s aren&#39;t a race. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they are. I mean besides the obvious insular nature of Judaic culture over millennia of quiet persecution, to the point where recessive traits are a serious problem and the Ashkenazis are studied for their longevity, the sort of white nationalist shitheads who constantly go on about &quot;the Jews&quot; sure as fuck also mean it in a racial sense. The Hebrews or Israelites or Leviites or whatever else you&#39;d like to call them to distinguish the concept from religious Judaica are as genetically and physiologically distinct as any other race. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s a Semite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A semite is a member of a semitic ethnicity, i.e. one associated with a semitic language. It includes most languages and related ethnic groups along the Red Sea and eastern Mediterranean. The fact that the word is adopted from Hebrew is kind of a hint.</p>

<p>You can, at which point you&#39;d be Jewish (religiously). You can also be born to an Ashkenazi family and convert to Christianity, at which point you&#39;d still be Jewish (ethnically).

<p>Race is a social construct. Meaning that not only is the concept of &quot;race&quot; something that we (as a society) created, but it has changed over time.  Citing passports and employment forms as proof of race&#39;s existence is circular, and in the United States it is always framed as self-identification, with an understanding it&#39;s a construct.    &quot;Jew&quot; as you would say, could easily be a race, all it takes is an agreement by enough people.  Take a look at the role of race in Brazilian society.  When Anthropologists talk about &quot;race&quot;, they are either describing the social effects that the concept of race has, or because the actual operational word, population, proves inadequate.  </p>

<p>It actually would, since Quakers are generally among the most tolerant, accepting people I&#39;ve met, and you&#39;re incredibly hateful.</p>

<p>First, you</p>

<p>Stopped reading here.  You.  <strong>You.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I AM NOT AN ISRAELI, SO DO NOT TALK TO ME LIKE I AM!</strong></p>

<p>Is that clear enough for you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the last thousand years have proven Jews are the only religion on earth that can&#39;t live in peace. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hilarious.  You seem to have forgotten a very, very large list of atrocities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They instigate wars,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crusades, to name one, for Christianity.  I could probably list a dozen other wars motivated by Christianity or Islam, the two religions ACTUALLY &#39;spread by the sword&#39;, unlike Judaism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>famine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Citation needed]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and genocide </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Citation needed].  If you&#39;re talking about THE BIBLE, that shit probably never happened.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>everywhere they go. They rob, steal and murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No more than Christians.  There&#39;s ZERO evidence to back this up besides your own bullshit prejudices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They think acquiring money is next to godliness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says you.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They molest children without fear of prosecution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, you mean like <strong>The Catholic Church still does?</strong>  You mean like the Muslims in various countries who <em>still take Child brides</em>?  You&#39;re a massive hypocrite.  These two religions do this as well, and they do it on a MUCH more massive scale.  Don&#39;t you DARE sit there and pretend these are crimes invented by or unique to Judaism, when Child Marriage is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah">sunnah</a>, since the Prophet Muhammed took Aisha as his bride at age 9.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They segregate themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>YOU segregate us.  You - and I do mean Christian Europe - has driven Jews into ghettos and insular communities for THOUSANDS OF YEARS.  YOU struck first.  YOU made the Jews hide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hoard money,</p>

<p>refuse to pay taxes</p>

<p>and they are preach ethnic and religious superiority. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there are no groups of white Christians or Muslims who&#39;ve <em>ever</em> done <em>that</em>.  Bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They do it all...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every single claim you made about Judaism applies to Christianity and Islam, you&#39;ve just chosen to ignore it because - wait for it - you&#39;re a prejudiced bigot.  You sit here and pretend that Islam and Christianity haven&#39;t started wars, or caused people to be mistreated, or kept women in a place of subjugation for millennia, or institutionally abused Children on a much larger scale than Judaism, but you&#39;re just WRONG.  These religions have had far more numerous crimes committed in their names in the last thousand years, and to say otherwise is a complete revision of history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heck, they even celebrate the slaughter of 75 thousand Persians every year, it&#39;s a motherfucking holiday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you mean Purim, no, you&#39;re wrong again.  What&#39;s being celebrated is <em>survival.</em>  There&#39;s a joke in my family, that every Jewish holiday has the same story: &quot;they tried to kill us, they didn&#39;t, let&#39;s eat.&quot;  That&#39;s it.  Almost every holiday isn&#39;t a celebration of the people God killed for us, but of the fact that people have been TRYING to wipe us off the face of the Earth for THOUSANDS OF YEARS, and yet, here we are, still alive, even if most of us are atheists these days.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are a disgusting people, born out of myth, deceit, murder and betrayal, and they do not deserve to live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When someone tells me that I don&#39;t deserve to live because of my birth, regardless of what I believe, that person is a monster.  You are a monster, dieselphiend, and your calls for a genocide are disgusting.  </p>

<p>Understand this: I&#39;m a Quaker, we have never persecuted any group or nationality the world over</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, YOU are dieselphiend, and YOU are a hateful bigot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done with this.  Here&#39;s the part that you&#39;ve never understood: the world is made up of individuals.  People are not simply defined as the group you choose to represent them; they can&#39;t all be fit in neat little boxes like &quot;Jew&quot; or &quot;Non-Jew&quot;.  Whatever Quakers have or haven&#39;t done, your argument wasn&#39;t &quot;Quakers are the best religion&quot;, it was &quot;Jews are the worst, because they&#39;re the only ones who&#39;ve done [huge list of things that Christianity and Islam have been guilty of]&quot;.  Stop talking about your ancestors.  You don&#39;t get to take credit for them, and you don&#39;t have to apologize for them, any more than I have to apologize for mine, or take credit for mine.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t try to prove to me that YOU&#39;RE not guilty of the things Jews are guilty of, you tried to prove to me that NO ONE ELSE is guilty of those things.  I responded with irrefutable examples that completely shattered your narrative, so you changed your argument,  rather than admitting that you were wrong.  That&#39;s dishonest enough that this will be my last response to you.</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening in the HERE and NOW is that you are preaching hate, and engaging in persecution.  I don&#39;t give a shit if that&#39;s not something &quot;Quakers&quot; do, it&#39;s something YOU are doing, and nothing in the world can undo that fact.  If Quakers don&#39;t preach hate, and YOU are preaching hate, then either YOU are not a Quaker, or Quakers CAN be hateful.  Those are the options - take your pick.</p>

<p>Also: you seem to think that the problems of Christianity and Islam lie in the distant past.  I believe I made it quite clear that this is NOT the case.  Militant Islamists are blowing themselves up <em>now</em>.  They&#39;re taking child-wives <em>now.</em>  Catholic priests are engaging in (and covering up for) Pedophilia <em>now</em>.  Protestant Christians are harassing (and sometimes assaulting) homosexuals <em>now</em>.  These religions - and I know that ultraorthodox Jews are every bit as bad, today - are engaging in these evils <em>in the modern world.</em>  Stop pretending that I&#39;m talking about thousands of years ago - I&#39;m not.  I made it very clear that your entire speech was nothing but bias, repeatedly turning a blind eye to </p>

<p>Lastly, the fact that you attribute &quot;The holocaust of Russian political dissidents&quot; to Jews or Judaism is ludicrous; it can be attributed to Josef Stalin, and he was <em>certainly</em> no Jew.</p>

<p>What I expect from your reply: The same shit that&#39;s been in every other reply of yours - hate, historical revisionism, and excuses for why you&#39;re NOT a prejudiced asshole, while at the same time saying incredibly prejudiced things.  </p>

<p>I won&#39;t be replying to you again on this topic.  We may meet again, in some thread in the future, where I see you spreading misinformation without a care in the world as to whether or not some tidbit that fits your narrative is true, and I&#39;ll call you on it then.  But here, tonight, you attempted to argue that history had played out a certain way, and when I demonstrated that you were completely and utterly wrong, you changed the subject and went on the defensive.  I don&#39;t debate people who can&#39;t accept when they&#39;ve said something false.  Goodnight.</p>

The sad thing is that he does not provide details for about half of his stories, he rambles on without getting to the point and will never personally expose people. He will always make it out to be a mysterious group of people that are ruling the whole world. Of course this is true, but it does not help to keep saying that without naming these people and the crimes they commit.</p>

<p>Here are some additional podcasts which you might like:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kpfa.org/guns-and-butter">Guns &amp; Butter</a> Guns and Butter (once a week 1hour,  mostly geopolitics or conspiracy-related)
Usually the host Bonny Faulkner interviews a guest, but sometimes lectures or documentaries are broadcast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/UNWELCOME_GUESTS">Unwelcome Guests</a> Unwelcome Guests (once a week 2 hours, interviews and lectures on various topics) A collective presents a mixture of interviews, readings, lectures and documentaries. Usually the episodes are issue-specific, but sometimes the host reads from a book in more than one episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blackopradio.com/">BlackOpRadio - mostly about JFK</a> Usually the host Len Osanic interviews one or more guests on his show. Jim DiEugenio acts as co-host and answers JFK-questions from the audience. He also presents new research in the JFK-community.</p>

<p><a href="http://scotthorton.org/">The Scott Horton Show</a> Scott Horton sometimes likes to bash conspiracy theorists and I am no fan of his libertarian philosophy, but he has lots of interesting guests and I think he is a very good interviewer</p>

<p>Now you have designed formal epistemological categories for classes of people (Sliders/disinfo agents/politburo whatevers) that make you not have to acknowledge or engage competing truth claims.</p>

<p>Are you kidding? Is that <em>not</em> what is happening when people call someone a conspiracy theorist? </p>

<p>An honest question: have you considered that there are shills who <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1898687/pg1">act</a> like &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; to reinforce the &#39;tard meme? To my mind, both sides of the field are being played, and that is really the only way to do it.

    <div class="md"><p>This is, by the way, the single most common disagreement received when anyone starts talking about shills, and is basically a conjuring of the rational spirit, which also conveniently is often used to set up an additional opportunity to discredit or insult the larger &#39;group,&#39; defined here as conspiracy theorists.

<p>Well done. </p>

<p>Posts like this do no benefit for anyone by generalizing folks and their social experience levels. Using instances of socially inept &#39;conversations&#39; to attack the broad field of conspiracy theories is crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>conspiracy has gotten nearly triple the viewers in the course of three years, this to me indicates a shift in the normal train of thought. With such an increase, we have also seen more and more of the old topics that would only fly here being reposted in politics, passing off in world news, and the like.</p>

<p>This ain&#39;t no backwater board anymore. It&#39;s become vital to the process. It&#39;s only natural that the place where truth is hinted at would be selectively targetted, hence again, the topic we are posting in.</p>

<p>The current debate is about the watering down of quality, a ploy at misdirection. A way to turn the populace away from this place. Somebody is afraid of this place. I&#39;ve seen really shitty posts here lately, as compared to last year when firms just started hiring the shills.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certain this shit hole has plenty.</p>
