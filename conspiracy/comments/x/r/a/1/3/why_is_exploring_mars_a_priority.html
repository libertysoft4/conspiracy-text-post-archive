    <div class="md"><p>Mars had water once, we don&#39;t know what happened to it. If we found out what happened to it, then perhaps we can prevent something like that from happening to our planet.</p>

<p>Also the yearly operating budget for NASA is $19 Billion. It takes $20 Billion alone to send air-conditioners to the military tents in Iraq and Afghanistan. It&#39;s a penny to every tax dollar that goes to NASA. That&#39;s one cent of every tax dollar collected by the government.</p>

<p>You should read this article to see what NASA has actually done to solve pressing priorities here at home:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do not send that much money to NASA. This latest rover only cost each US citizen 7 bucks over the course of 10 years.  The same as the price (Even less than) for seeing the shitty movie Total Recall. </p>

<p>So no we are not pumping money into sensational NASA projects.  If anything, we are letting very very little money trickle into amazing NASA projects that push the envelop of human ingenuity. </p>

<p>And if you can&#39;t see why exploring our closest planetary neighbor is important.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>is complicated. really. some motives:</p>

<p>-keep the so called intelligent guys occupied with something. a small percentage of the population is intelligent enough to figure out the scam played at the highest level of humanity. Give them some &quot;higher&quot; purpose in life to keep them out of the way. It become impossible for them to accept that studying higher mathematics, discover the secret of the stars or whatever is less important than figuring out how the human society works and also do something about it. Is like trying to reason with a religious people. Nothing you can say is more important than Jesus or Allah or whatever.</p>

<p>-provide more money for hidden research. Do you think the elite actually diverts money to a real research to send robots to mars? Nope, they just need to take the money from the budget and have a bullet proof motivation. If you say something against this you are automatically a retarded person who doesn&#39;t understand the higher purpose of humanity (see above) So many of those people who jumped around in the NASA control center are really believing that rover is on mars based on some stupid simulation on the screen. The easiest to fool is the people who believe themselves very intelligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;keep the so called intelligent guys occupied with something&quot;  seriously?  what an idiot. </p>

<pre><code> V (i think you meant becomes here, maybe thats why people call you &#39;tarded scrote)
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;It become impossible for them to accept that studying higher mathematics, discover the secret of the stars or whatever is less important than figuring out how the human society works and also do something about it.&quot;
Actually, most of them know the very stark reality that 
 * If we do not figure out how to get off this planet... then we will die with it
 * If we do not figure out how to get more resources for this planet, including what could be a potential ocean of frozen water locked in the surface of mars... then we die with it.</p>

<p>Just because the science you may not understand completely doesn&#39;t mean your paranoia needs to govern everything you do. Conspiracy people are always telling people to open their eyes... well open your eyes... </p>

Really, I understand that there are probably more secrets being kept from us than we can imagine, but not <strong>everything</strong> is a conspiracy or a distraction. NASA has helped to pioneer many advancements in science and technology, many of which you probably take advantage of. This was done for science and science is done to learn new things. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all that this is, just fucking science and learning things about Mars and maybe linking those findings to things on our planet. Jesus people, chill out.</p>
