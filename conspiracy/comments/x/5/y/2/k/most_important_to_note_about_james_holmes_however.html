<p>Most important to note about James Holmes, however, this report says, is that his father, Robert Holmes, was said to have been scheduled to testify within the next few weeks before a US Senate panel on the largest bank fraud scandal in world history that is currently unfolding and threatens to destabilize and destroy the Western banking system.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes, whose “blueblood” family links go back to the Mayflower, is known throughout the global banking community as being the creator of one of the most sophisticated computer algorithms ever developed and is credited with developing predictive models for financial services; credit and fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.</p>

<p>Educated at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University, Robert Holmes is currently the senior lead scientist with the American credit score company FICO, which was formally known as Fair, Isaac and Company, and which every American citizen is beholden to should they need to borrow money.</p>

<p>The massive banking crime being investigated by the US Senate is called the LIBOR Scandal where UK banks fixed the London Interbank Borrowing Rate with the complicity of the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve (which knew about this crime for 4 years and didn’t report it) and many other major Western banks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all know those &quot;Kremlin&quot; reports and Sorcha Faal are <strong>full of shit,</strong> but is there any truth to this bit about his dad?</p>

<p>The idea that his father was going to testify before the US senate about LIBOR, and his mother said &quot;yes you have the right person&quot; on the phone, makes this whole &quot;elite killer, gas mask, getaway car, drugged up Holmes as a patsy&quot; theory more credible no? His son could&#39;ve been made the scapegoat for this as a way to keep his father silent or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading up on the circulating theories about Holmes being a patsy and whatnot, but the hypothesis that the stress of failing out of grad school precipitated psychological issues that lead to him committing the shooting off his own accord seems more plausible at this point.</p>

<p>Why would they frame the son if they were after the father? They could&#39;ve murdered him and covered it up as a suicide. That would&#39;ve been much more straightforward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone know what the Senate meeting was called or when specifically it was going to take place?</p>

<p>Why would the shooting prevent or stop the Senate meeting from taking place?</p>

<p>Did he(Robert Holmes) testify or is he going to?</p>

<p>Seems like the have identified who but now when or where any info would help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Throwaway..</p>

<p>James Holmes did look drugged.  Who knows if he actually killed people?  I suppose he has no memory of it?</p>

<p>The chance of this hearing and the massacre happening so conveniently close to each other are extremely small.  I would estimate a 1/60000 or less chance of both the family connection and the time connection.</p>

<p>Assuming this is true, I wonder, why didn&#39;t they just kill the dad?  Would that have been too suspicious?  Are there other ways they could prevent the testimony?</p>

<p>Here is a theory: if this doesn&#39;t prevent the testimony, it will be used as a pretense to kill the father, a rogue gunman blaming the him for the deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>which is mere speculation until someone actually confirms all of this..it sounds terribly convoluted. Not complex, and cunning, but clunky and strategically flawed. Is it really so difficult to wait until more evidence is presented to make a judgement call? This kind of dialogue is really a dead end until more comes to light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which would be great if this were a Mission Impossible movie, but I think most alleged hit jobs are much better at keeping things straightforward and tying up the loose ends to a degree that ensures plausible deniability.How on earth did you come to such an estimate without even knowing for sure that the hearing is in any way related to Holmes or his father and what kind of algorithm would produce such a number?</p>

<p>I wish I could say we&#39;re catching them in the act with our keen eye for inconsistencies in official reports, but it would be incredibly naive to believe it. If this were a state-sponsored or banking cartel-related job, it would not be so unnecessarily complicated. They&#39;re very good at sweeping most things under the rug. They&#39;ve been doing it since even before the dawn of market societies. It&#39;s too early to tell whether this is what it seems. </p>

<p>The dude hasn&#39;t even spoken about it yet. That doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a mind control victim,hell, it may even mean he&#39;s a fucking sociopath who knows what he&#39;s doing, and knows every time he opens his mouth the media will piss itself over the boost in ratings theyll get for covering it. Sometimes circumstances can exacerbate latent mental conditions. Who knows at this point.</p>
