        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was on 4chan when threads started exploding all over about UN vote to ban guns in the United states.  The resolution stalled in the senate right before the Aurora shooting happened and now that its up for vote again it is likely to pass which will means most or all semi-auto weapons will be confiscated.  apparently when anon found out about it the website was freezed (no posts can be made and all gun ban threads have been deleted) </p>

<p>i also see zero coverage of the bill in any media outlet except infowars and a little blurb in RT</p>

<p>is the bill being voted on now or in the next day or two?</p>

<p>Thing is that it&#39;s going to get a lot worse.  You have to ask yourself where will we be as a citizenry when it does finally get even worse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how about a slow grind? like, you ever try to machine something? on a mill? if you go full depth all at once, reasoning here that you need to make a pretty significant change, you either shatter the bit, or throw the piece.. you have to mill off just as much as you can at a time, too fast and the piece damages the machine, or throws the work right back at you.. too slow and you&#39;ll miss the deadline..</p>

<p>the funny thing about both beck and gore is that they were/are pretty wrong timing wise, but their core logic is pretty sound when it comes to the overall(in my understanding, gore pointing out that humans effect their environment on a grand scale, beck that governments with a fiat currency will graft away until obsolescence) .. not that I really think either has anything but a demographic to hustle, but whatever, of no consequence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think this is a case of the slippery slope argument where people insist that if something bad happens it&#39;ll just get worse over time (forever, seemingly). In medieval times we would have all been peasants, and although some of you may hyperbolically argue that we still are (because you don&#39;t have the rocket-powered jet car that some billionaire has), I&#39;d say the human condition has improved vastly over time.</p>

<p>No disrespect whatsoever, as I think you have sound points, but what I think you&#39;re missing is how devious and underhanded TPTB can be and are.  I mean, afterall, the constitution of the U.S. has already been all but stripped and raped as it stands.  I don&#39;t think that the 2nd amendment is something that would be beneath TPTB to at least <em>attempt</em> to undermine and do away with.</p>

<p>I think before anyone assumes the OP is simply to outlandish to be true or real, I think we need to realize that it&#39;s much better to be mindful and watchful of something like what OP posted to be a reality first.  Better safe than sorry I say.</p>

<p>EDIT - the bill would not allow the UN to take any weapons, the purchases would just need to be documented in a big UN database that would not include any weapons used by hezbolah, hamas, the crips, north korea, or anyone else that already does, and will continue to run afoul of national and international law.</p>

<p>&quot;That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; that a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided, as far as the circumstances and protection of the community will admit; and that, in all cases, the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.&quot;</p>

He had to try it because the alternative media was so popular and the TV networks are so unpopular.

<p>The problem in Canada is that only the criminals and the government have guns. This is not a positive, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass shooting in Toronto? One man was dead, and he was targeted and involved within the gang scene in the area. I think that&#39;s a completely different scenario than this. Again, Canada,Europe, Australia, New Zealand , etc, all have thriving societies and very few of those countries have to deal with gun related violence.When it does happen its 90+% of the time related to illegal activity such as gangs and robberies. Most US Citizens own guns, but I don&#39;t see a decrease in gang activity and gun related violence there just because people are &quot;protected&quot;. It doesn&#39;t add up to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My reading about the jewish ghettos in Germany and about Cambodia undert the Kissinger/Brzezinski supported Khmer Rouge are two of the main reasons I am concerned about increasingly corrupt governments trying to take away the guns of their people.</p>

<p>I can understand how people ignorant of history and naive about the true nature of governemnt would be pro-gun control. please study and try to develop your powers of empathy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glenn Beck&#39;s job actually was to copy Alex Jones but try to put a neocon spin on it. He had to try it because the alternative media was so popular and the TV networks are so unpopular. It didn&#39;t work to well, because people that get started with Alex Jones ned up migrating to other alternative media like The Daily Bell, antiwar.com,Land Destroyer blog , Corbett report, What really happened etc.</p>

<p>The internet reformation is underway and their isn&#39;t much TPTB can do about it but try to take over the internet...and so far that has failed thankfully.</p>
