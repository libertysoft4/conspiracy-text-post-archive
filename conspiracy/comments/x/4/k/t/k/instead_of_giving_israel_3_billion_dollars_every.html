    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the few things I agree with Ron Paul with, but like most of the things he says (even the ones I support him on), they simply will not work for many reasons.  They just <em>sound</em> really good.</p>

<p>Whether people want to admit it or not, it would be political suicide to do so.  The US&#39; Jewish population is both rich and powerful.  They are a big player both in government, as actual politicians, or as aides or counsel.  As voters, they make up a large part of Florida voters.  You lose Florida, and as a Presidential candidate, you lose a really big state.  If an established politician voted for cutting funding, not only would he be labeled as an anti-semite, but he could also be labeled as weak on defense or even pro-Muslim or all manner of other labels.  </p>

<p>You would NEED bi-partisan support to kill funding of Israel, but good luck getting any bi-partisan support for anything these days.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s missing the point now? A distinction hardly worth making, I assure you. If we were spending the equivalent to shore up own own infrastructure and social systems, you&#39;d have a point. But we are not. Which indicates to those that are paying attention that this &quot;mission of peace&quot; is anything but. What you call allies are instead defensible beachheads for Corporate interests to launch their mineral rights campaigns from. </p>

<p>Israel is the most polarizing force in the ME, and is supported to aid in destabilizing the region to this end, making it easy for a corporate entity to swoop into these countries and buy up mineral rights for pennies on the petrodollar, then turn around and sell them for insane profits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  This system <em>is</em> broke, but talk about &quot;tearing it down&quot; is foolish at best.</p>

<p>Its not their fault that the American people are short sighted and so easily swayed by 5 second sound bites. Our representatives, whether you want to admit it or not, do indeed mirror their constituents.  But too many people are foolish enough to think that just because you can voice your opinions, its the same thing as acting on those opinions and going out to vote.</p>

<p>There is a very good reason why the young people in this country always seem to get shafted by elected officials.  Its because the average spoiled American teen and twenty-something is more interested in their new iPod than to bother voting and getting involved in the system.  Conversely, seniors in this country are, for the most part, treated like royalty, because come hell or high water, they vote.  You want to see what other groups vote? Go see who gets the best treatment when it comes to politics.  </p>

<p>Is there too much money and corporate influence in politics? Oh, abso-freakin-lutely. But there are other ways that that could be fixed or curtailed that doesn&#39;t involve some silly idea of &quot;tearing it down&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always interested in other peoples opinions on how to fix everything. The whole issue of voting concerns me too, because we know that voting can easily be rigged.

    <div class="md"><p>Stop the nonsense.</p>

<p>Its not gonna happen, and quite frankly the idea that you &quot;need&quot; a revolution to get things done is utter BS.  </p>

<p>There was a political revolution in this country some ~30 years ago when the NeoCon movement swept the national stage and since then we&#39;ve been living under their policies and we feel those repercussions all the time.  </p>

<p>The notion that &quot;the system is rigged&quot; is both tiring and smells of defeat.  Apathy is the establishment&#39;s biggest ally because it makes people think that &quot;both parties are the same&quot; or &quot;its not gonna matter&quot;.  I buy into that thinking, I&#39;m sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, however, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get that out of most a-typical christian americans (which are a minority, so I don&#39;t know why their opinion matters so much on something that doesn&#39;t make sense).</p>

<p>Speaking for myself as a Christian, I think the US made a big mistake by trying to force most of the Jewish population back into Israel to try to fulfil a Biblical prophesy; the worst part is that they forced the Palestinians out of their own land to do it (which is why there is so much unrest in the area).</p>

<p>As much as I would want the funding pulled, since the leaders of the US made a precedent to give funding, I suspect it would be almost seen as an act of war to pull that money away from them.</p>

<p>For this, among other various reasons, Ron Paul will never be elected.  He wants to do good things, but unfortunately those good things are very opposite of what the US government is slowly leaning towards.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I should mention that when I&#39;m talking about Israel, I&#39;m talking about Israel State, not the nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite.</p>

<p>Most of the Chinese who died under Mao (40 to 70 <em>million</em>) died from starvation due to incompetent applications of Communism. It wasn&#39;t an attempted genocide, as all the victims were Chinese. The intent wasn&#39;t to wipe out Chinese.</p>

<p>Stalin actually <em>did</em> attempt to commit genocide against the Ukranians, but even conservative estimates put it at about 10 million deaths, compared to the 12 million who died under the Holocaust. Most put the deaths closer to about 1-4 million. Those who died afterwards (some 1 - 30 million depends on how you count) in the Gulags and other offices of Stalins regime were not from genocide attempts, but from sheer ruthlessness at wiping out political &quot;opponents&quot; which including nearly everyone in Russia. </p>

<p>Neither of them even came close to what Hitler did per capita, on his attempted genocide of European Jews, he killed a full 2/3rds of the people he attempted to wipe out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>even with the edit it&#39;s still absurd. considering that the Germans killing thirty million people gutted the USSR for a generation, Stalin pushing that to sixty million would have made Russia look like Upper Volta (<em>without</em> missiles) a generation early.</p>

<p>the claims that the 1937 and 1938 famines were acts of deliberate genocide is just as ridiculous, unless you want to extend that to include Russians and other ethnicities too. over a third of the population of (largely Russian) northern Kazakhstan died of starvation during that same period, for example. the reasons there was armed resistance uniquely in the Ukraine are because they were the major breadbasket of the country (and wanted to feed themselves first) and because Trotsky <em>did</em> cause mass intentional famines ten years earlier as part of his strategy against the Makhnovists (not a few people actually thought that he was back and lamented &quot;if only Comrade Stalin knew of this, he would stop this!&quot;).</p>

<p>both Stalin&#39;s and Mao&#39;s death tolls were almost entirely because nobody in either government had no idea how to run a country and put ideology ahead of pragmatism, not any deliberate malice on their part. the idea that any of Hitler&#39;s contemporaries were doing anything close to what he did is largely just a fanciful <em>tu quoque</em> argument made by weirdos who want to rehabilitate fascism as being anything other than an ideological excuse to go a-viking.</p>

The reason that it&#39;s only semi-shared is because popular Christian theology has certain twists based on the New Testament, which Jewish people generally do not believe is canonical.</p>

<p>This is one of my biggest pet peeves with the Israeli right to the land question. America was conquered in a much more disgusting and wrong manner than the establishment of the State of Israel, yet Israel gets a lot more hatred. The Palestinian people were never asked to crowd into the territories, it was the surrounding Arab countries that refused to accept their own &quot;brothers&quot;.</p>

<p>EDIT: I didn&#39;t even notice your comment about the &quot;Act of War&quot;. The discontinuation would NEVER be considered an act of war, and I don&#39;t know why you would say something like that.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think Israel State may be the US&#39;s only &quot;second gun&quot; because they are pumping so much money into them.  It may not turn into some sort of act of war, but it certainly wouldn&#39;t have a response like, &quot;I guess you need your money somewhere else, no problem.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is an issue over the bought land (however, some may criticize the tactics used to purchase it), but I think the bigger issue was that land was lost over war, as an aggressive expansion to fully reclaim some land to make a few Zionists happy.</p>

<p>I think the reason a lot of people don&#39;t like Israel (at least in these post world war times) is because everyone sort of sees them as the weaker brother to the US when it&#39;s very clear that they can hold their own.</p>

<p>And what do they need these extra billion dollars?  It&#39;s not like the state is particularly hurting financially (at least not any worse than the US).</p>

<p>Won the rest in a war of aggression. Fought after a world war against aggressor regimes also looking to expand their territory. A war in which the same people now doing the expanding were horribly abused.
The aftermath of WWII was an agreement by the world that (open) wars for the purposes of territorial expansion could no longer be tolerated. Yes, this idealism didn&#39;t extend everywhere or manage to hold up 100% of the time but one would have expected the people who as a group got their shit kicked in the hardest be the last ones rolling fucking tanks into their own Rhineland. </p>

<p>As for equating it to the conquering of Texas etc. anyone who&#39;s read that history knows the young United States acted pretty horrendously. There were glorious even honorable <em>moments</em> as there are with most wars but, on the whole? Fuck those guys. It&#39;s &quot;ok&quot; now because nationalistic whitewashing of history happened along a long enough time frame that the details have been &quot;forgotten&quot;. Welcome to the 21st century, that kind of shit doesn&#39;t (shouldn&#39;t) fly anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America was conquered in a much more disgusting and wrong manner than the establishment of the State of Israel, yet Israel gets a lot more hatred</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sure was. An entire indigenous population was almost exterminated. Some Mexicans died too (I kid). But you know what? Those events happened during colonial, post-colonial and imperial phases of western history. That&#39;s not an excuse for conduct, that&#39;s historical context. Context is important. Again, the young state of Israel didn&#39;t get a free pass to employ historically shameful expansionist practices because &quot;you did it first&quot;. A new state is expected by the global community to come into the world cognizant of the era it finds itself in and conduct itself accordingly. I don&#39;t get to own slaves if I can subdue some just because my great-great-great grandfather owned slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Palestinian people were never asked to crowd into the territories, it was the surrounding Arab countries that refused to accept their own &quot;brothers&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me? Crowd into the territories? As if the land was already carved up just like that before Israel the new state existed? As if they weren&#39;t peacefully spread out before the state existed?</p>

<p>And why should the surrounding nations have accepted a nation of refugees created overnight by expansionist military aggression? Because they&#39;re Arabs? They should have just ignored the socio-political and economic situation within their own states? Just bankrupted themselves absorbing sudden unplanned immigration because their new neighbor decided to unilaterally expand its borders? Come the fuck on. </p>

<p>Reread what you just wrote because what you basically said was, &quot;if they didn&#39;t like it they should have just left and other countries should have taken them in&quot;.
If I were to say &quot;if Jews in Nazi territory didn&#39;t like the segregation and discrimination they should have just left (during the period they were free to do so obviously) and other countries with Jews should have taken them in. I mean no one <em>asked them</em> to stay in the land they identified with home&quot; people would lose their goddamn minds.</p>

<p>Well no, that is not true. That land has been the home of Jews for several thousands of years. There is ample amounts of evidence. It was previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which ended and split up. The UN divided up some of the the land and gave a small sliver to Israel. This was agreed upon internationally. Israel has fought and won several wars defending themselves. It is theirs. This isn&#39;t &quot;right-winger&quot; claims or whatever idiotic stuff you want to spit out. These are the facts. </p>

<p>Also The Iranians talk a big game they would never attack Israel because they know Israel alone could wipe them out.</p>

Maybe the reason people call anti-semitism on threads like this is because it is awfully suspicious to single out only Israel when there are numerous other countries that receive substantial foreign aid packages despite not being seriously under-developed.</p>

<p>With that said, NASA probably is a better use of funds than some of these foreign aid programs.  Frankly though, we waste significantly more money on domestic programs that have even less benefit which I would rather divert funding from.  </p>

<p>Maybe not to ZERO, because I do believe that some money spent on supporting out allies is cheaper than fighting our enemies, but still cut funding for all countries.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the kicker.</p>

<p>Far as I know, Israel is the only country that time and again sells our military secrets to countries like China, and goes against our best wishes when it comes to dealing with international situations.  If they want to go all rogue on us and start WW3 in the middle east, then that&#39;s on them, but unfortunately, every time that Israel does something, WE are automatically implicated as accomplices.  And I for one am sick of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link doesn&#39;t work for me - I get an error about the site not allow hot linking.  According to USAID here are the total receipts of foreign air/military assistance for each country in 2010 (in millions):</p>

<p>Pakistan: 2,853.5
Israel: 2,835.8
Egypt: 1,698.9
Colombia: 863.7
Jordan: 767.1
Russia: 505.9</p>

<p>So Egypt, Jordan and Colombia combined do get more than Israel, and Egypt gets more than half of what Israel does.  Also interesting to note the West Bank/Gaza received 693.1 million, a full 10% of their GDP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who are Americas enemies?  </p>

<p>That is a loaded question.  If you want to follow the media and certain groups in this country, the &quot;easy&quot; answer is &quot;all those Muslims&quot;, but that&#39;s bullshit because the only reason many Muslim nations don&#39;t like us is because we as a country have meddled into their affairs for decades now.  And one of the reasons that is that we blindly support Israel even when they instigate their Muslim neighbors.  So even though Israel is supposedly  an &quot;ally&quot; of ours, they get us into trouble with the very nations that have the single most important resources to our prosperity.  Also Israel, even though again, they are supposed an &quot;ally&quot; has been caught stealing our military secrets and selling them to the Chinese.  For that alone, we should cut funding to Israel.  Not only would cutting financial ties to them save us a tiny amount of money, but it would also improve the US&#39; standing in much of the Arab world.</p>

<p>If makes most economic sense, to be friendly with the people that control a vitally important natural resource, than it does to see them as enemies.  </p>

<p>Whereas, American and coalition forces have used weaponized WP in afghanistan and iraq. </p>

<p>If you think Pakistan isn&#39;t occupying an indigenous people without their consent, then you&#39;ve never heard of the Baluch people. Who, unlike the Palestinians, had a history before the creation of the state of pakistan. </p>

<p>While we&#39;re there, the accusation of &quot;apartheid&quot; is pretty sickening to those who actually saw apartheid, in its real form, in south africa. And again, if you think Russia and Pakistan aren&#39;t sending spies into other countries to kill diplomats and politicians (something israel hasn&#39;t done, unless you consider arms dealers to be politicians), then you&#39;re just not paying attention. </p>

<p>TL;DR: your comment is the epitome of the argument that criticism of israel is based upon double standards, inappropriate and emotionally manipulative use of provocative phrasing, and ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incorrect. The average Israeli Jew is descended from Arab Jews ethnically cleansed from the Arab countries between 1925-1970. Before the Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union arrived in the 1970&#39;s, they numbered about 70% of the Jewish population of Israel. In addition, while the exact numbers are debated, it is certain that a significant percentage of the &quot;Palestinian&quot; population is descended from those who lived outside of what is now Israel and the occupied territories prior to 1948. Look at the leaders of the Palestinian movement. Arafat was born in Cairo. Edward Said spent most of his childhood in Egypt and was half Egyptian. The large Palestinian clans which dominated pre-zionist politics can mostly trace their histories back to outside of Palestine in the last few centuries. Non-palestinian nisbat (arabic name modifiers which imply a familial origin) are extremely common amongst palestinians. And the area has been conquered dozens of times in the past few hundred years. It has also been subject to waves of mass immigration/emigration, natural disasters, and massacres of the majority of the population. It&#39;s disingenuous to assume that the palestinians are &quot;indigenous&quot; and the jews are not. </p>

<p>Why all your pity for the Arabs uprooted by violence, but disdain and denial about the greater number of Jews uprooted from arab lands by violence?</p>

<p>I believe my original comment answers that question quite well.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s not to say that I don&#39;t think Israel deserves criticism for a many of its actions. But there&#39;s no difference between criticism and hatred when the criticism is based upon lies or double standards. </p>

Frankly, I think if the term anti-semite (and the accusations of hate that come with it) were no longer used in the U.S., criticism of Israel would drop off a cliff. In other words, I would <em>theorize</em> that the double-standards you discuss exist because no one really cares to defend Russia or Pakistan on any but the most &quot;pragmatic&quot; (in the worst bastardization of the word) terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why America give Israel so much money is for help with intelligence. Israel Has discovered more terrorist cells in the U.S. and warned of constant attacks that were prevented due to Israel intelligence. We also give Israel money so we have an ally close enough to the Muslim arab states incase the plan to attack the U.S. as there leaders have proclaimed. I do not agree with many thing Israel has done but do not be so quick to judge. </p>

It seems to be very wide spread especially in Arab countries although most will adamantly deny this.  I am caught in a catch 22: people will and do use hate for Israel and Zionism as a shield for their antisemitism but if I call them out they say that everyone says your antisemitic for disagreeing with Israel but on the other hand those people make people like me suspicious of most anti Israel people because so many are really just anti jew which makes it harder to accept their opinions (does this make sense)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the same reason why there should be self-policing amongst all groups and cultures.  If someone has done something evil regardless of their affiliation they should be handed over for justice or ostracized.  We saw an example of this in the US with Jerry Sandusky.  This man was evil and the fact that he was hidden and his deeds covered up by people trying to protect their own was something that cultures around the world do regularly.  Police brutality in the US falls in the same category IMO.
I agree people use anti-Israel as a shield of anti-semitism but quickly jumping the gun on both sides of the argument prevent intellectual conversation.</p>

I have never met anyone that made it apparent they are anti-Semitic. They might have been, I just was never shown it. I&#39;m all for Jews but not when they act the way Israel has. I honestly don&#39;t see the two as the same thing. From what I gather, some Jewish fundamentalists feel the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The economics is a bit counter intuitive, but can be illustrated simply.</p>

<p>If nobody thinks the economy is doing well, they do not shop, or invest in the future, because they believe that saving the money, instead of investing or spending, is their best option. This leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the economy really does slow. This is a recession.</p>

<p>If the government starts investing, people see the results, and it can jump-start a recovery. This requires borrowing, in lean times such as today. It&#39;s not &quot;Money we don&#39;t have,&quot; it&#39;s a loan. When is borrowing a good idea? This is actually the same as any corporation - if the government thinks that the things it borrows to buy or create are cheaper now, or will cause benefits that exceed the costs. If the government can spend $100 on something that saves $20 / year from now on, that is a good investment. </p>

<p>So if the government can spend $1t to help the economy recover, the only question is whether the total economic benefit from doing so exceeds the cost. If the benefit of that spending is, say, $500b/year, then (without really discussing tax policy and the effects on spending,) the idea is that spending the money now will be worth the investment, which can be recovered by taxing half of that added benefit for a bit more than four years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>or, people arent saving because the govt is printing money out of control to pay for wars and finance debt and if i but $1 in the bank today in a year the $1.03 i will have from interest will only but $.94 of what i could have bought that first year. And its not the govts job to run the economy. Its not in the Constitution to take from the people to spend on companies who lobby so that we can get a &quot;jump start&quot;. Every time the govt gets in the economy it changes for the worse. How bout we let the free market work, stop bailing out companies and let them fail so the ones who live will be stronger and learn about malinvestment. This &quot;no consequences&quot; society needs to stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the sentiment, but the reality is that the government is needed to make the economy work. In complex systems, reductionist solutions are tempting, but rarely optimal.</p>

<p>Without government backing, the dollar you have today is worth nothing. Literally nothing. So who decides on the rules for currency, fractional reserving, and interest? We could go back to having nobody in charge, but modern economies would not work if that were the case. (There would be significantly too much uncertainty to invest in anything.) The US government certainly has some corrupt practices, some bungling, and some very significant drawbacks, but the response can&#39;t be &quot;we&#39;ll just let companies do whatever they want.&quot; Unlimited corporate power isn&#39;t capitalism as envisioned by Smith or other theorists, and it does not work.</p>

<p>A central issue is that governments tend towards maximizing their power, which means they interfere when they should not, and they are less efficient at running programs than the free market. In a democracy, the only check on this is the will of the people; if the government upsets too many of them, they will be forced out of office. </p>

<p>But corporations are not the answer; corporations also tend towards maximizing their power, and they have no responsibilities to anyone but their owners. If the most profitable course of action is to let people die, they will. If the most profitable course of action is to kill people, bribe governments, or destroy the environment, they will do that also. The only check on increasing corporate power is government, in the form of regulation and pressure from people, in the form of boycotts - and that only works when government forces corporations to be transparent enough for the public to know what companies are doing. </p>

<p>So we have a system that has two forces that interact, and collusion between them is the &quot;no consequences&quot; society you dislike. It&#39;s a problem, but upsetting the balance of power in the favor of corporations isn&#39;t a solution.</p>

<p>PS. As a final point, capitalism works best when corporations are small, and non has the power to materially disrupt the market. Government is notoriously bad at encouraging small companies at the expense of large ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did explain the point a bit, but not sufficiently. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible for it to work, it&#39;s a complex topic. The problem with your approach to the argument, however, is that you are trying to win instead of discuss the topic and understand it. Because of that fact, confirmation bias will ensure that you never change your mind, right or wrong.</p>

<p>Your theories about competitive currency are not well thought of by economists for a variety of reasons. That doesn&#39;t imply that you are wrong, just that people who know a lot about the subject disagree. If you are convinced of your argument, you should read what the other side has to say, with an open mind. That won&#39;t force you to change your opinion, but it will make you evaluate your opinions outside of an echo chamber that only reinforces your prior beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the recovery happened because of the devaluation.<br/>
I suppose you would also argue that Obama is responsible for the job losses of the recession because the recession deepened just after he took office.
Of course it would be possible in the US.  We already do do this, it&#39;s called quantitative easing.  However, it&#39;s probably not sufficient or desirable to do the job only through inflation and so we also need economic stimulus investment from the US govt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never disagreed that the recovery happened because of the devaluation, but the decline continued through the bank changes and devaluation.  The only reason the recovery happened was because the resources could now be sold off at a far lower price of extraction due to the devaluation, helping to create low cost jobs in the resource industry.</p>

<p>Again, this can NOT happen in the US.  If you devalue the currency more all you will do is create even larger trade imbalances and end up costing everyone MORE for the resources that the economy requires to continue at the rate it does.  While the US is resource rich, you still import a massive amount from the rest of the world, and dropping the dollar will only make that harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The core issue at stake in a financial crisis is liquidity. To have a functioning economy, money has to move back and forth between parties. Debt is a major source of liquidity, as it allows people to both hold money and spend it at the same time.</p>

<p>The purpose of stimulus spending during a recession is not only to &quot;kick-start&quot; the economy, but also to add a huge influx of cash into the market. After Japan&#39;s crash in 1991 they refused to provide a sufficient influx of liquidity into the economy. They have never recovered.</p>

<p>A strong central bank manages not only interest rates, but also liquidity.  Have you ever heard of the crash of 1987? Probably not, because the Fed immediately added liquidity and the economy was able to recover.</p>

<p>Clinging to the gold standard extended the length of the Great Depression, because in a Gold Standard economy you <em>can&#39;t</em> add liquidity.</p>

<p>My main point is that people need money to do business, and if everybody is hoarding theirs, you need a central bank to start handing it out. Without a central bank, we&#39;d be screwed in situations like these.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look you can&#39;t bring down the defense budget to 0, as that would mean you would have no military at all. So from about 700 billion you can cut half or so and bring it to about 300-350 billions, that would still make for 1 trillion deficit. </p>

<p>So yes I do see other ways to cut spending. If I was elected to be a tyrant I would allow competing currencies, print another 10 trillion dollars and give all individuals over 18, 30k us dollars, cut the deficit by 1.4 trillion by abolishing the FBI, reducing the CIA by half, dismantling the homeland security, ending the wars and cutting back the defense budget to about 250 billion dollars, cut the FDA, EPA, end Obamacare, remove medicaid and medicare, transfer state schooling to the states, reduce congress salaries and benefits by half, remove insurance companies from the medical equation and provide real FREE medical services paid for by the government in the emergency service and set up an account for donations to the emergency service, remove fractional reserve banking, allow market interest rates, abolish the FED, remove all business regulations, end all food stamps, revamp the social security and make all accounts private, unable to be used by the government, allow everyone to opt out of it, start a full audit of unemployment benefits to curb double users or users that are employed and I believe this will be enough to cut 1.5 trillion dollars. </p>

<p>With the 30k worth of bailouts of every individual it will assure people who are fired like all the people in the FBI and TSA and the rest of them have money for about a year, it will insure most of the debt is payed off, whether its student loans, business loans or house loans, this will in turn free up the banking system and increase confidence as people are paying off their debts, this coupled with the removal of fractional reserve banking and allowing market interest rates will promote accountability by the banks and allow for savings, with interest rates rising high due to the economic situation before this, we&#39;d actually see the value of the US dollar increase offsetting the 10 trillion dollars of newly printed money and then ending the fed to ensure no more manipulation of the markets. </p>

<p>In case the 10 trillion actually causes very high inflation or borderline hyper inflation, I would have allowed for competing currencies of all kind be used, so people have a fallback. </p>

<p>With all of the cuts the federal budget would actually make a profit for the first time in over 100 years. I would do all this within 3 to 6 months, the sooner its done the faster the recovery can occur and I expect within a year all that individuality and all those entrepreneurs to start building businesses and producing stuff, starting to offset much of the unemployment and I expect a full recovery within 1 to 2 years with  a steady growth of about 2-3% percent for the next 5-10 years.</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably cut taxes as well within 2 years or actually increase taxes for some who have been paying 2-3% only and have a flat tax rate of 18%, remove all corporate, inheritance or other taxes and only have the income tax set at 18% for everyone with no exceptions, even for charities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you have to also take into the argument that the US is the only first world population that is still growing, so our future tax forecast is still increasing so that&#39;s why our economy hasn&#39;t gone in the shitter like it would for most other countries with the same situation. Also you have to put into account whoever has the biggest stick makes all the rules and with a 14 trillion dollar debt which is mostly spent on the military I&#39;m pretty sure we have the biggest stick by far. &#39;Merica</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well again, nice theory, but it rarely works. Thing is as long as the government can auction off money (for whatever reason, even things like building roads) it will provide incentive for private companies to lobby and that creates corruption and corruption creates more corruption and we all know where that leads to.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say you want very limited government and only small local government being able to offer small local contracts like to some company to maintain the lights and stuff. </p>

<p>But yeah, 4 trillion dollar government and look where that got you, more or same amount of government isn&#39;t the solution, its less government, less governments contracts, less government workers, less government involvement, less, less, less. </p>

<p>Look the USA just federal government is bigger than any government that has ever existed in the history of the world, there has never ever been bigger government in the world, how is that working out for you?</p>

<p>The answer is less government, significantly less.</p>

<p>EDIT: And believe me I&#39;ve heard and analysed the argument of: &quot;oh we just need better government, not less&quot; it doesn&#39;t hold water at all. Its absolutely incorrect. Its just not humanly possible, any way you look at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just a soundbite to get you into the false paradigm of more government. I call it getting back to free markets and property rights and family. You can still have actually many government programs like social security type, which is supposed to be a guaranteed bank account of your money and when you reach a certain age you are able to get back your money. </p>

<p>In a free market system, putting those same amounts of money into real banks will be 10x more beneficial as you would be getting big interest on your parked money. </p>

<p>Essentially if you put 50k in your social security account you will only get 50k, if you park it at a bank, you would be getting 100k, 50k more on interest over your lifetime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just incorrect.  The government spent 3.6 trillion dollars this past year. You just rounded up 10%. And more than $100B was for the wars that are ending. And this ignores the costs that are indirectly caused by the war, like increased military costs. (See <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-usa-war-idUSTRE75S25320110629">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-usa-war-idUSTRE75S25320110629</a>. )  So take the total down to $3.5T.</p>

<p>Now, most of this is social welfare programs, instituted because the Us government decided that the policies that allow economic growth at the expense of some individuals should be compensated by creating a safety net, paid for by the increased growth the policies allowed. The problem is that the taxes have been decreased as economic growth and resulting displacement have increased.</p>

<p>The claim that tax expenditure should be determined by the actions of consumers in the free market would mean that the US government would be pouring money into McDonalds and Walmart.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty silly idea. Obviously that wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;free market&quot;. The US should stop taxing/taking money from people by force and let them spend it where they see fit. If the government gets out of the way and frees up resources, individuals can allocate those resources.</p>

<p>but would people drive nearly as much if every road were a toll road. Its rhetorical, as I don&#39;t believe there is a nation on the planet where every road is a toll road. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not. No one who thinks about the issue for  more than a minute would think this. I mean this is already the case that people create and maintain roads privately (i.e. gated communities and businesses). We don&#39;t need to socialize the costs of road upkeep in a community to the entire nation. Honestly, google or youtube search &quot;free market roads&quot;, there is ample information. It&#39;s not a difficult problem to solve, especially with technology, but even without it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My response was implying that a lack of free market spending should not be taken as a sign that it is not valuable or in the public good, and while my examples were hyperbolic, the price paid by the consumer rarely reflects the implicit costs of an object or service, whether it be a net positive or negative one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is why for example we have an unsustainable situation of suburban sprawl, because the true costs have been socialized.</p>

<p>Had resources been allocated more efficiently as a result of a functional pricing mechanism, such massive problems would not arise at least to the same degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FTA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as a result, researchers over the years have come up with a wide array of returns on investment for NASA spending. Estimated ratios of revenue generated compared to spending have been as high as 14-to-1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some early academic and other studies &quot;made very &#39;generous&#39; assumptions about the spinoffs, goods and services produced as a result of NASA&#39;s investments,&quot; G. Scott Hubbard, a consulting professor at Stanford University, said in an e-mail. A study commissioned by Hubbard in the mid-2000s when he was director of NASA&#39;s Ames Research Center in California on the center&#39;s local economic impact found a &quot;more conservative&quot; 2- to 3-to-1 ratio.</p>

<p>Trying to find a precise value for the economic benefits of NASA spending, though, may miss the point as long as it&#39;s acknowledged that the spending has at least some positive returns, Hertzfeld argues. He said that <strong>for a mission-focused organization like NASA, which isn&#39;t making a play for profits, any ratio of economic benefits versus spending that exceeds 1-1 &quot;is a success.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Wow, so this paragraph is fraught with glaringly obvious economic fallacies and does not consider the opportunity cost. It assumes that such contributions would not have arisen without funding NASA, that NASA was the best way to achieve them and that there were no better ways or means to do it.</p>

<p>This is of course the logic behind government spending who need to justify their actions (taxation/theft) to their tax livestock. </p>

<p>Perhaps the money spent on NASA was the best thing to do, it&#39;s difficult to say, but I doubt it and more importantly, I don&#39;t think its right to force that decision on people. Of course I think this way about all government spending and much less so far NASA, though this is the topic of this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably one of the stupidest posts I have ever seen--even stupider comments. Its this black and white thinking that has gotten our society to this stage. I would not agree that simply cutting foreign aid to Israel would just fix all the problems. Also, I dont see the point of building NASA up again when it space exploration is being privatized. It was clearly needed in the 60s when corporations were not willing to take the risk (it wasnt in the interest) where as now it is in their interest--they are doing it. Google the Google  space asteroid mining (Im sure youve all heard of spacex). The problem isn&#39;t funding Israel, Egypt or any other country. Its the fact that bureaucrats have this power in the first place. Its clear that your name &quot;freepalestinekashmir&quot; is not about fixing the US but rather screwing over the &quot;evil zionists&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes, privatized, which means that companies will be doing what is profitable. Not what will best expand the collective knowledge of the human race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its clear your a bit out of touch with what science is all about. Regardless, if you look into who are running these space explorations corporations, you are talking about people who have much passion for science and are not motivated by profits. I recommend you look at the interview of John Steward and Elon Musk, its very inspiring and gives you an idea of what this sector is going to be like. Were not talking about a Steve Jobs running a marketing scheme to make money, were talking about genuine people who love science and are willing to risk money for the research. Once again, you are keeping the argument too black and white. Also, because of the passion that most scientists have, they are easily exploited, its why many of the them get sucked in by wall street, because the govt programs in the major US universities are paying crap. Making it impossible to get a research position. Imagine how many geniuses are working for Goldman Sachs right now--look into it. </p>

<p>Wow, seriously? You <em>honestly</em> don&#39;t know anything about the direct and indirect benefits you take advantage of everyday due to NASA research?</p>

<p>I&#39;m really leaning on the side of believing you&#39;re trolling, because I can&#39;t believe anyone on Reddit is so ignorant of the technology in their home, but considering the influx of people Reddit is seeing, I&#39;m going to assume that you <em>may</em> be telling the truth.</p>

<p>Memory foam, contributed funding to improving cordless power drills, precision cordless medical instruments, dustbusters, insulting paint used on houses originally developed for space flight, advancements in plasma screen technology, improving water filtration technology originally meant for recycling water in space shuttles now used in commercial water infrastructure, wireless communications technology, gps, satellite weather forecasting, anti-corrosive agents originally meant for space shuttles to protect from radiation now used on buildings and bridges, development of new safety precautions in food manufacturing in order to prevent food spoilage in space, nutritional supplements in baby food originally meant to supplement astronaut diets, advances in fire fighting technology such as satellite fire tracking and fire resistant materials, <em>enormous</em> increases in solar power research, research done on phase change materials for use in spacesuits is now used in athletic equipment and shoes, advances in digital photography technology for incredibly high resolution photos in space and on other planets, research funded by NASA to examine ways to reduce vibration has been applied to guitar manufacturing methods, contributed to advances in MRI technology, adjustable sensitivity for smoke detectors.</p>

<p>There are many more, but I think I&#39;ve made my point. You can search Wikipedia and other websites for more. NASA puts out a magazine every year called Spin-Offs which detail all the products that are either direct implementations of NASA research or draw on NASA funded research to create new privatized products.</p>

<p>No matter how you feel about the topic, the fact remains that NASA needs to do shit in space. They need to do it well. If they don&#39;t have the technology to do what they need to do, they fund research to make it so they <em>do</em> have the technology. That research either brings about new products that can be used in the home or social infrastructure, <em>or</em> it is used indirectly to improve already existing technologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically space exploration hasn&#39;t helped me. R and D projects used in space have. What has been discovered in space that improves our every day lives? Nothing. All the things you listed are great but we would have discovered them anyway. Wars encourage development of products and new technology as well but you never see anyone supporting wasted money on a war. Fact is NASA was a great organization when the budget could support it but private industry is catching up and the budget can no longer support it. I&#39;m sorry you like space but it isn&#39;t doing anything for us.</p>

<p>Do you know about the Duke talent search?  If you show up as being in the .001% in terms of IQ or an individual gift the Duke talent search scoops you up before you&#39;re 12 and then WHAT HAPPENS?  Where do all these most gifted go?  They don&#39;t reappear in society...  their families receive a stipend...  but what about the smart kids?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be impressed with all that military technology and stuff, but the reality is that the US has been fighting a bunch of goat farmers in the hills of Afghanistan for the last 10 years, people who have pistols, AK47s, RPG7s, the occasional 50 Cal anti-aircraft and a smattering of road-side bombs.</p>

<p>Despite this very basic arsenal, against which the US has 2 of everything that&#39;s available to the modern war fighter, they haven&#39;t won a decisive victory. I think that&#39;s ever-so-slightly embarrassing, especially when you consider that the US spent almost $140 billion dollars on the war in Afghanistan in 2011, the Afghani GDP being in the environs of $36 billion. And that doesn&#39;t translate into a victory.</p>

<p>How much toys do you actually need? At the prices mentioned above, you could give every Afghani a job, double their pay, give them Afghani-level single payer health care and you&#39;d be cheaper off than what you spend bombing them. I really think you should try that one time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point.  I&#39;m more talking about the USSR&#39;s involvement over that region and what their influence would have been if we were never involved at all.  The history of that region since the end of WW2 is so complex due to the worlds involvement that it&#39;s hard for me to simplify it if we were never involved with Israel in the first place we wouldn&#39;t have these enemies.  But if you get into current events, and the fact that no other world power has a whole lot of influence there, then I do agree that our current involvement directly relates to having enemies in the region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so there&#39;s actually two problems with this.</p>

<p>1) 3 Billion dollars is miniscule. The NIH has $30 billion of funding per year, and NASA&#39;s funding is $18 billion. Adding $3 billion to either (unless directed towards a particular goal/project) basically amounts to a blip on the radar.</p>

<p>2) The money towards Israel gives us something (a stable democracy in the Middle East willing to do our bidding and provide us bases) that&#39;s surely worth $3 billion a year. Compared to where else we send our money (ahem, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc.), that&#39;s not bad. To Israel, that money means a lot more than it does to us, who have massive budgets.</p>

<p>Take a look for yourself. I honestly can&#39;t believe that you&#39;d think that giving money to most of these countries is better than giving money to Israel.</p>

<p>And a reason for Islamic countries in the Middle East to hate America even more. America needs to end this idealization of &quot;peace-keeping&quot; operations. It has no right nor reason to be in the Middle East, besides the oil to be acquired and a sense of &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;peace&quot; given to us in exchange for American lives. America shouldn&#39;t be funding Israel, nor should it be funding any other Middle Eastern countries.</p>

<p>The situation in the Middle East benefits Israel, defense contractors, oil companies, and the political elite in the US. It has no benefit whatsoever for the average American citizen.</p>

<p>The US get&#39;s nothing out of it. Jordan, Egypt (Pre-arab spring), Saudi, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE are all countries that maintain healthy relationships with the US. The US also has bases all over these countries. It&#39;s these bases they use to flex their muscles. </p>

<p>Israeli citizens have universal healthcare. Effectively the US subsidises Israeli healthcare without having any of it&#39;s own (I know this is worded to sound worse than it is, but you get the point).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, Richard Falk is a known Israel basher and cannot be considered an objective observer any more than, I don&#39;t know, Khaled Mashal. </p>

<p>And no, in America you <strong>can</strong> place a child in solitary confinement. Here&#39;s a good article about it!
<a href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/06/18/girls-in-juvenile-justice-an-invisible-population">http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/06/18/girls-in-juvenile-justice-an-invisible-population</a></p>

<p>So yea, your article follows the predictable pattern of anti-israel hysteria. Link to an article about somebody who has made a living bashing Israel, criticizing them for some minor complaint (arresting children for what would be considered attempted murder in most places and putting them in solitary) and acting as if they&#39;re the only country that acts this way, even when the majority of western countries are <strong>worse</strong> in that regard. </p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of legitimate things to criticize israel about. But bullshit like this is why most americans ignore the palestinians. Their supporters rely far too much on emotional manipulation and blatant double standards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Americans ignore the Palestinians for the same reason they ignore the Somali genocides or any other of numerous atrocities: because our information flow is controlled.</p>

<p>That article is linking to a UN sanction...  not one person&#39;s testimony, sorry you perceive a world where anyone who thinks atrocities are wrong are anti-Israel.</p>

<p>Also, your counter link has absolutely no sources for its statement children in America are placed in solitary confinement AGAINST THEIR WILL barring extreme violence.  Most children in solitary are over 16 and are there per their request for protective custody.  Not even similar situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, the palestinians get access to the worldwide media <strong>far</strong> out of proportion to the actual conflict. Every time an israeli builds an apartment in the occupied territories, it&#39;s front page news all over the world.

<p>Ten thousand civilians die in the Congo, or Sri Lanka...and it&#39;s buried in the back of the international section. </p>

<p>The UN has a systematic bias against Israel due to the Muslim bloc having a stranglehold on the organization. </p>

<p>I can find numerous other sources. It&#39;s not even a debatable fact. In western countries, children are placed in solitary. Just as it&#39;s not remotely debatable that calling the solitary confinement of violent offenders an &quot;atrocity&quot; cheapens the term. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m perfectly willing to criticize Israel. But this is just the epitome of stupid, double standard arguments. </p>

It&#39;s really a shame how often this occurs to people who associate themselves with Israel, in terms of ego investment.  If America was systematically bulldozing Mexican homes and moving the border and the Mexicans blew up a few buses (And in America people not in contact with the Jewish communities are exposed to the anti-Israeli violence all the time in the media) I suspect the UN would sanction America just like it keeps trying to do to Israel.</p>

<p>As to why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict gets covered front page... there&#39;s a significant portion of the US that is made up of ignorant bible thumpers who like to hear how white people control Jerusalem again.  There&#39;s also a large group of liberals who believe it is the nexus from which the next world war will begin, this means that there&#39;s a lot of the population who pay attention to stories about Israel, not as many care about &quot;that African country&quot; and &quot;those black people.&quot;  Sad truths.</p>

We&#39;re almost there with super tensile solids (carbon!)and the powering of the vehicle is hitting some major breakthroughs.  The Andes are near the equator, there are places you could take loads from Atlantic AND Pacific without too much additional work, and it&#39;s sparsely populated so if something goes wrong less people will be in the danger area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about that at one point.  Instead of the gov&#39;t deciding 100% of the budget, they decided on basic &#39;minimums&#39; then part of our vote would be voting for where to place the rest (so you could vote to have 50% of that remainder going to NASA, etc)</p>

<p>The problem is, I looked at the U.S. spending, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png">pie chart</a>, and Mandatory Spending makes up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#Major_expenditure_categories">over 50%</a> of the spending, and reducing the military to non-war levels (only my thoughts on this) would still take up a good deal of that pie chart to keep us &#39;safe&#39;.  </p>

<p>The remainder, in my mind, is so small that I&#39;m not sure whether giving citizens a vote on what&#39;s more important would change much at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way you described it is how the Fed&#39;s budget already works. Congressmen are elected by constituents and they figure out the budget. What I&#39;m talking about is drastically cutting spending from the budget, which reduces the need to tax people, which then allows people to keep more of the fruits of their labor. Letting individuals decide how to best spend their money means it doesn&#39;t go to the government at all, it means they are free to voluntarily give it to whom they see fit through the purchase of goods/services, donations, investments, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a point to be made here; there are a lot of places we could cut spending so that we could fully fund NASA. I have heard that we spend more than a few dollars paying for the defense of Europe many believe they should be paying for their own defense. I am very frustrated with the lack of funding for our public school system and NASA; I am at the point where I think perhaps we should stop giving out any foreign aid at all. It’s seems all it buys us is terrorist attacks and comments about American imperialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Giving money to SpaceX wouldn&#39;t help. SpaceX is a business, it looks for profit, and space exploration does not give that much profit. You need government funded agencies to do the research first, then try it, and then give it to the private sector. That&#39;s what happens everytime. Space exploration is very, very risky, and there&#39;s a very low chance that it would give profit very soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. A long time ago I thought &quot;Hey that asshole from paypal is trying to go into space?&quot; But I&#39;ve come to learn that Elon Musk is a very dedicated and forward thinking person. His businesses aren&#39;t about profit as so much moving the world forward. I suggest you do some googling and check out some youtube videos. No one else sinks their entire fortune into space, solar, and electric cars, while at the same time telling VC&#39;s &quot;we&#39;re doing this to go to space, you may never see a profit&quot;.</p>

<p>The only time we move forward is when we find dedicated and competent leaders. Otherwise it&#39;s just a giant money sink. I find nearly everything about the shuttle program stupid, whereas SpaceX is doing everything right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Elon Musk is a space fan. But, what I meant was that private companies will never lead the space frontier. It was always the governments which start the trade, always map the roads and so on. Columbus didn&#39;t go to &#39;the edge of the Earth&#39; because he was an explorer, he was given the money by the governments, and was told to put their flag if he finds any land. Later he mapped where peaceful natives were, where dangerous ones were, and so on. THEN he gave the information to the private trade so the people could profit. I&#39;m just looking at the history, because it was always the government funding which leads everything, and later it&#39;s given to the private sector.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no this is wrong again. A great deal of science (probably could be stated as most of science except for the past few decades) has been done in the past basically by rich people who could afford to fund themselves and had the time to do so, or worked for a private education institutions. Isaac Newton for example? Pretty much all the classical scholars, even ancient greek.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying NASA couldn&#39;t do good things. What I&#39;m saying is they have no clear goals and no leadership to provide it. In case this post is viewed as private vs public, this is certainly not the case. I&#39;ve worked at private institutions with the same problems as NASA. No leadership, no vision, a bunch of bozo&#39;s entrenched in their jobs who somehow never seem to do anything or get fired for it. You have to understand I was 6 when Challenger blew up. I followed that story intensely, that was my lesson in &quot;what not to do&quot; as an engineer. My dreams were crushed by the weight of the political and organizational problems at NASA. At 6 years old.</p>

<p>The leadership is at SpaceX so there the funding should go. This is clearly a better choice. 3 billion dollars would buy NASA 2 shuttle launches! Watch my circular logic here - that program was designed the <em>spend</em> money in US, not to go to space. The biggest pork barrel boondoggle ever conceived by humanity. Besides the Big Dig, at least.</p>

<p>Actually I&#39;ve been thinking seriously of sending my resume in to SpaceX. Do something useful with my life...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>rather than risk angering people by having to vote about cutting off funding (though..we don&#39;t have to even vote to let the tax cuts expire and that&#39;s a huge fight anyway....) i assume that foreign aid already has to be renewed..if not..we really need to see why a country can get money forever and our transportation system can&#39;t...we should tie all foreign aid to some kind of emergency trigger. like if tax revenue drops the foreign aid will be in the first layer of &#39;crumple zones&#39; to absorb the impact. well maybe not immediately since there&#39;s probably some contract between us...but maybe it can be auto flagged for not renewing it and since it&#39;s based on a financial statistic it&#39;s not like we&#39;re purposefully being mean to any specific country.. the world is probably used to us having a lot of strange rules that keep popping up :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, while being a great idea, will never happen. This country&#39;s politics have become more polarized then ever before with the extreme elements of each party leading the political conversation. The extreme bible thumping christian right totally and unequivocally believes for Christ to be resurected the ancient temple of Solomon must be rebuilt. Therefore there must be strong Jewish presence in jeruselm to eventually force out the muslim population, tear down the dome of the rock and rebuild the temple.</p>

<p>Another reason for this to never happen is the concerted effort by pro Israel groups over the last 30 years to become more and more  influential in Washington D.C. politics (which they have done with insanely large politcal contributions).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Did you not watch the video? I&#39;m being serious here. He explains a few reasons why you should save it.</p>

<p>1) Doing missions out of low earth orbit will lay the framework for more money and services (thereby helping our economy).</p>

<p>2) If we repopulate at least 1 other planet, no planet-wide problem will be able to remove the human race from existence.</p>

<p>3) NASA does what kids dream of doing. Without it, you lose kids interest and the ability to look forward to tomorrow. Doing so will have a cascading effect in where we lose all interest in advancing science (or at least the space sciences).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No thats stupid. If we cut funding to Israel then 40 years of American policy in the Middle East goes to shit.</p>

<p>The big picture of military spending on Israel has tremendously stabilized that region. Israel had been in three big regional wars in 20 years from 1948-1967. US started backing Israel around Lyndon Johnson&#39;s presidency. Egypt and Saudi Arabia realized that with a great power backing the tiny state, any action by them united or otherwise would be useless. Ever since we started overtly backing Israel, there has been one large war involving Israel. That was in 1972, however their foes were backed by the Soviets in that conflict- the only time the Soviets intervened militarily in the Middle East.</p>

<p>As the years have gone by, those nations, the former overt enemies if Israel, have cooled their prejudices, its populace becoming more tolerant of Israel. </p>

<p>Now, i have not mentioned the Taliban, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq or Afghanistan. The resurgence of Islamic extremism in those states has really thrown a bone into the grinder. But that is a product of religious fervence. The Egyptians and Sauds have come to grips with the political reality. </p>

<p>Though, we in the United States are confident that strategy of, in the short run, wasteful allocation of resources(your words) through military backing of Israel will eventually cool the tensions of the current enemies(extremists) over several decades, as that policy was 100% effective with Israel&#39;s former most prominent enemy (Egypt). </p>

<p>So in the long run the US has stabilized the Middle East, but in the headlines we&#39;re always the warmongering dick.</p>

<p>Sorry for the dick fingers(I love parentheses)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do we went to dominate and kill people over there?</p>

<p>Fair enough question.</p>

<p>To ask that question you have to ask why we are there in the first place. There&#39;s an easy answer. I&#39;ll tell you, but in return I want you to read the rest of my answer. We are there for the petroleum, oil. </p>

<p>Oil is what made the United States the wealthiest nation on Earth. It&#39;s why we have a high standard of living. Oil makes our plastics, medicines, cars, tires, you name it. Hell there&#39;s some hydrocarbons compounds in our money. Because of it, energy is cheap and plentiful thus we can only produce as much as our imagination limits. But I&#39;m not getting into. If you want to know how valuable oil is to the US, become an economics major. If you want to know why oil is such a wonderful compound, become a biochemist. But I&#39;m not getting into that because that would take freaking days. I&#39;m giving you the sociopolitical benefit that the Middle East has gotten from exploitation.</p>

<p>We choose to stabilize the region so the oil companies fields, refineries, and shipping routes will be safe, thus they will invest further. Oil, oil, oil, oil, oil. Say it a hundred times. </p>

<p>I assumed you already knew that.</p>

<p>Fuck it youre clearly a stoopid high school mutherfucker and im not wasting anymore time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of it is Foreign Military Financing and goes to U.S. defence contractors like Lockheed Martin. Since WWII the United States has provided Israel with $115 billion in bilateral assistance. Much of this money is given as a form of kickback-scheme. Israel and the defence contractors profit at expense of the average taxpayer. </p>

<p>So it is a logical consequence that many neocons operate as lobbyists for both defence contractors and Israel.</p>

<p>Here is a Congressional Report from 2012 about U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel
<a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf</a></p>

<p>And here is an excellent inteview. Richard Cummings highlights how lobbyists and profiteers of defence contractors played a vital role in the lead up to the Iraq War.

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about that at one point.  Instead of the gov&#39;t deciding 100% of the budget, they decided on basic &#39;minimums&#39; then part of our vote would be voting for where to place the rest (so you could vote to have 50% of that remainder going to NASA, etc)</p>

<p>The problem is, I looked at the U.S. spending, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png">pie chart</a>, and Mandatory Spending makes up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#Major_expenditure_categories">over 50%</a> of the spending, and reducing the military to non-war levels (only my thoughts on this) would still take up a good deal of that pie chart to keep us &#39;safe&#39;.  </p>

<p>The remainder, in my mind, is so small that I&#39;m not sure whether giving citizens a vote on what&#39;s more important would change much at all.</p>

While it is true that the US gives the most money to the Jewish state, private individuals have been sending money to Israel for DECADES and it is in the millions if not billions of dollars. (It does not have to be public knowledge as it is thought of as a religious donation). Also Israel has the most nukes of any country in the region, a hawkish government who is not afraid to use its military and a militeristic element of the population who believes that land was actually promised a thousand years ago but some man in the sky that must be reclaimed. </p>

<p>Also The Iranians talk a big game they would never attack Israel because they know Israel alone could wipe them out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think Israel State may be the US&#39;s only &quot;second gun&quot; because they are pumping so much money into them.  It may not turn into some sort of act of war, but it certainly wouldn&#39;t have a response like, &quot;I guess you need your money somewhere else, no problem.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is an issue over the bought land (however, some may criticize the tactics used to purchase it), but I think the bigger issue was that land was lost over war, as an aggressive expansion to fully reclaim some land to make a few Zionists happy.</p>

<p>I think the reason a lot of people don&#39;t like Israel (at least in these post world war times) is because everyone sort of sees them as the weaker brother to the US when it&#39;s very clear that they can hold their own.</p>

<p>And what do they need these extra billion dollars?  It&#39;s not like the state is particularly hurting financially (at least not any worse than the US).</p>

<p>(Egypt had its own problems to deal with so that wouldn&#39;t happen anyway, but if Mubarak had maintained his grip on power it would be in a position to meddle in other states.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no this is wrong again. A great deal of science (probably could be stated as most of science except for the past few decades) has been done in the past basically by rich people who could afford to fund themselves and had the time to do so, or worked for a private education institutions. Isaac Newton for example? Pretty much all the classical scholars, even ancient greek.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying NASA couldn&#39;t do good things. What I&#39;m saying is they have no clear goals and no leadership to provide it. In case this post is viewed as private vs public, this is certainly not the case. I&#39;ve worked at private institutions with the same problems as NASA. No leadership, no vision, a bunch of bozo&#39;s entrenched in their jobs who somehow never seem to do anything or get fired for it. You have to understand I was 6 when Challenger blew up. I followed that story intensely, that was my lesson in &quot;what not to do&quot; as an engineer. My dreams were crushed by the weight of the political and organizational problems at NASA. At 6 years old.</p>

<p>The leadership is at SpaceX so there the funding should go. This is clearly a better choice. 3 billion dollars would buy NASA 2 shuttle launches! Watch my circular logic here - that program was designed the <em>spend</em> money in US, not to go to space. The biggest pork barrel boondoggle ever conceived by humanity. Besides the Big Dig, at least.</p>

<p>Actually I&#39;ve been thinking seriously of sending my resume in to SpaceX. Do something useful with my life...</p>

<p>What Israel has done, and continues to do to the Palestinians is on the level of Apartheid in South Africa.  And the Palestinians being Muslims, all the nations in that region hate Israel, and because of our close ties to Israel, they hate us as well.  Any time Israel does something to instigate their neighbors, we are typically the ones that are indirectly blamed for their actions.</p>

<p>Its not gonna happen, and quite frankly the idea that you &quot;need&quot; a revolution to get things done is utter BS.  </p>

<p>There was a political revolution in this country some ~30 years ago when the NeoCon movement swept the national stage and since then we&#39;ve been living under their policies and we feel those repercussions all the time.  </p>

<p>The notion that &quot;the system is rigged&quot; is both tiring and smells of defeat.  Apathy is the establishment&#39;s biggest ally because it makes people think that &quot;both parties are the same&quot; or &quot;its not gonna matter&quot;.  I buy into that thinking, I&#39;m sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, Jimmie Level: rustled</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and won the rest in a war. No one disputes the Louisiana Purchase or the fact that the United States conquered Texas and Florida from Spain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Won the rest in a war of aggression. Fought after a world war against aggressor regimes also looking to expand their territory. A war in which the same people now doing the expanding were horribly abused.
The aftermath of WWII was an agreement by the world that (open) wars for the purposes of territorial expansion could no longer be tolerated. Yes, this idealism didn&#39;t extend everywhere or manage to hold up 100% of the time but one would have expected the people who as a group got their shit kicked in the hardest be the last ones rolling fucking tanks into their own Rhineland. </p>

<p>As for equating it to the conquering of Texas etc. anyone who&#39;s read that history knows the young United States acted pretty horrendously. There were glorious even honorable <em>moments</em> as there are with most wars but, on the whole? Fuck those guys. It&#39;s &quot;ok&quot; now because nationalistic whitewashing of history happened along a long enough time frame that the details have been &quot;forgotten&quot;. Welcome to the 21st century, that kind of shit doesn&#39;t (shouldn&#39;t) fly anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America was conquered in a much more disgusting and wrong manner than the establishment of the State of Israel, yet Israel gets a lot more hatred</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sure was. An entire indigenous population was almost exterminated. Some Mexicans died too (I kid). But you know what? Those events happened during colonial, post-colonial and imperial phases of western history. That&#39;s not an excuse for conduct, that&#39;s historical context. Context is important. Again, the young state of Israel didn&#39;t get a free pass to employ historically shameful expansionist practices because &quot;you did it first&quot;. A new state is expected by the global community to come into the world cognizant of the era it finds itself in and conduct itself accordingly. I don&#39;t get to own slaves if I can subdue some just because my great-great-great grandfather owned slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Palestinian people were never asked to crowd into the territories, it was the surrounding Arab countries that refused to accept their own &quot;brothers&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me? Crowd into the territories? As if the land was already carved up just like that before Israel the new state existed? As if they weren&#39;t peacefully spread out before the state existed?</p>

<p>And why should the surrounding nations have accepted a nation of refugees created overnight by expansionist military aggression? Because they&#39;re Arabs? They should have just ignored the socio-political and economic situation within their own states? Just bankrupted themselves absorbing sudden unplanned immigration because their new neighbor decided to unilaterally expand its borders? Come the fuck on. </p>

<p>Reread what you just wrote because what you basically said was, &quot;if they didn&#39;t like it they should have just left and other countries should have taken them in&quot;.
If I were to say &quot;if Jews in Nazi territory didn&#39;t like the segregation and discrimination they should have just left (during the period they were free to do so obviously) and other countries with Jews should have taken them in. I mean no one <em>asked them</em> to stay in the land they identified with home&quot; people would lose their goddamn minds.</p>

<p>What do I have in my house that I can thank NASA for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, seriously? You <em>honestly</em> don&#39;t know anything about the direct and indirect benefits you take advantage of everyday due to NASA research?</p>

<p>I&#39;m really leaning on the side of believing you&#39;re trolling, because I can&#39;t believe anyone on Reddit is so ignorant of the technology in their home, but considering the influx of people Reddit is seeing, I&#39;m going to assume that you <em>may</em> be telling the truth.</p>

<p>Memory foam, contributed funding to improving cordless power drills, precision cordless medical instruments, dustbusters, insulting paint used on houses originally developed for space flight, advancements in plasma screen technology, improving water filtration technology originally meant for recycling water in space shuttles now used in commercial water infrastructure, wireless communications technology, gps, satellite weather forecasting, anti-corrosive agents originally meant for space shuttles to protect from radiation now used on buildings and bridges, development of new safety precautions in food manufacturing in order to prevent food spoilage in space, nutritional supplements in baby food originally meant to supplement astronaut diets, advances in fire fighting technology such as satellite fire tracking and fire resistant materials, <em>enormous</em> increases in solar power research, research done on phase change materials for use in spacesuits is now used in athletic equipment and shoes, advances in digital photography technology for incredibly high resolution photos in space and on other planets, research funded by NASA to examine ways to reduce vibration has been applied to guitar manufacturing methods, contributed to advances in MRI technology, adjustable sensitivity for smoke detectors.</p>

<p>There are many more, but I think I&#39;ve made my point. You can search Wikipedia and other websites for more. NASA puts out a magazine every year called Spin-Offs which detail all the products that are either direct implementations of NASA research or draw on NASA funded research to create new privatized products.</p>

<p>No matter how you feel about the topic, the fact remains that NASA needs to do shit in space. They need to do it well. If they don&#39;t have the technology to do what they need to do, they fund research to make it so they <em>do</em> have the technology. That research either brings about new products that can be used in the home or social infrastructure, <em>or</em> it is used indirectly to improve already existing technologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do we went to dominate and kill people over there?</p>

<p>Fair enough question.</p>

<p>To ask that question you have to ask why we are there in the first place. There&#39;s an easy answer. I&#39;ll tell you, but in return I want you to read the rest of my answer. We are there for the petroleum, oil. </p>

<p>Oil is what made the United States the wealthiest nation on Earth. It&#39;s why we have a high standard of living. Oil makes our plastics, medicines, cars, tires, you name it. Hell there&#39;s some hydrocarbons compounds in our money. Because of it, energy is cheap and plentiful thus we can only produce as much as our imagination limits. But I&#39;m not getting into. If you want to know how valuable oil is to the US, become an economics major. If you want to know why oil is such a wonderful compound, become a biochemist. But I&#39;m not getting into that because that would take freaking days. I&#39;m giving you the sociopolitical benefit that the Middle East has gotten from exploitation.</p>

<p>We choose to stabilize the region so the oil companies fields, refineries, and shipping routes will be safe, thus they will invest further. Oil, oil, oil, oil, oil. Say it a hundred times. </p>

<p>I assumed you already knew that.</p>

<p>Fuck it youre clearly a stoopid high school mutherfucker and im not wasting anymore time. </p>
