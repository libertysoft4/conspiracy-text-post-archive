        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, before I get to the juicy bit, let&#39;s have a little background...</p>

<p>There was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/xf1n7/worlds_scariest_drug_colombian_devils_breath_a/">a video posted yesterday</a> about the drug (thanks Foogey). The drug makes one highly susceptible to suggestion - easily led to do things without the ability to resist. The nay-sayers in the comments there, don&#39;t seem to have any credentials and are downplaying the significance of this drug&#39;s effects (I noticed that, immediately... much like I notice others who come here to say &quot;you&#39;re all whackjobs exaggerating things&quot;)</p>

<p>But, there is something interesting here and I want you to see what I discovered when I googled for the drug itself.</p>

<p>The second result in the google search results was this one...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682509.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682509.html</a></p>

<p>the Scopolamine Patch.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting about this, you might ask... well... I&#39;m glad you did (if you did), because here it is...</p>

<p>The patch is applied <strong>behind the ear</strong>.</p>

<p>Now...</p>

<p>Go look at those (despised) photo comparisons of Holmes... and notice that in the drugged/stupefied image, his left ear sticks out more than his right... almost as if he might have something stuck behind it, forcing it to stick out... like maybe a patch? A Scopolamine Patch, perhaps?</p>

<p>Crazy? Probably. But still... it may explain why he remains drug-stupefied and unable to even speak his own name, even unto this day.</p>

<p>EDIT: Spelling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re kidding, right?</p>

<p>A scopolamine patch is like little over a centimeter in diameter and is as thin as a piece of paper. </p>

<p>It would probably take several scopolamine patches to intoxicate someone. The patches take (12?) hours to actually kick in. Considering it&#39;s over the counter, a single patch probably does not make one susceptible to mind control. There are probably better drugs to incapacitate someone. Mr. Holmes would have an incredibly dry mouth, bad nausea and be acting a lot differently. 
If Holmes was on any drug during his trial, it would probably have been an anti-psychotic.</p>

<p>Why do you believe some documentary more than common sense? Why all of a sudden do people have such a focus on this one drug? People are so ignorant of pharmacology they think it&#39;s like magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem...what if your therapist has an agenda?  His worked for the VA for 2 years and worked with the Campus harm reduction team.  I agree that a person under the state of such a large dose of scopolamine would not be able to perform tasks as such, but definitely think it&#39;s possible his therapist was prescribing him the patch to use over time, and she was suggesting things to him over the coarse of treatment.  Or maybe that&#39;s all disinformation to distract all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would also understand that no one is exactly the same. Some are more sensitive to drugs than others. You don&#39;t know as much about Scopolamine as you think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of seizures or psychosis, since scopolamine can potentially aggravate both disorders.</strong></p>

<p>Since drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion may occur with the use of scopolamine, patients should be warned of the possibility and cautioned against engaging in activities that require mental alertness, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating dangerous machinery.</p>

<p>The most serious of these that have been reported are: acute toxic psychosis, including confusion, agitation, rambling speech, hallucinations, paranoid behaviors, and delusions.</p>

<p>Transderm Scóp is contraindicated in persons who are <strong>hypersensitive to the drug scopolamine</strong> or to other belladonna alkaloids</p>

<p>The signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include: lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias.</p>

<p>Symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and headache occur following abrupt discontinuation of antimuscarinics. Similar symptoms, including disturbances of equilibrium, have been reported in some patients following discontinuation of use of the Transderm Scóp system. These symptoms usually do not appear until 24 hours or more after the patch has been removed. Some symptoms may be related to adaptation from a motion environment to a motion-free environment.</p>

<p>symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal (see Drug Withdrawal/Post Removal Symptoms)... mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal</p>

<p>Children are particularly susceptible to the side effects of belladonna alkaloids. Transderm Scóp should not be used in children because it is not known whether this system will release an amount of scopolamine that could produce serious adverse effects in children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scopolamine isn&#39;t much different from any other strong deliriant - some of which I&#39;ve done recreationally. Personally, I don&#39;t see it being much of a mind-control drug. I could see a person being more suggestible when on the drug, sure. But I highly doubt someone on the drug would have the ability to cognize complex tasks, or even to perform them physically, if he was on a dose high enough to make him so suggestible. And even if he did, he would be incredibly disoriented and incoherent while he did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hypothetically, sure, works for me. I think scopolamine is fine for simple stupification type tasks, like getting some unwitting idiot to remain compliant at a crime scene. I could even conceivably see Holmes put in some private area, made to watch some re-enactment of a theater shooting, then set free, and being unsure whether he participated in the shooting or not, assuming all of this took place under the influence of some deliriant drug.</p>

<p>I definitely would never believe anyone on scopolamine could perform any complicated task at all, though, unless it was being performed strictly by muscle memory or adrenaline in a life-or-death type of situation perhaps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mine are hugely asymmetrical, I was one of those kids with the big ears (think alfalfa from little rascals), however as I got older one straightened more than the other. I took a webcam photo of myself, making sure to face straight ahead, and found my ears were worse than the picture in question, with one of my ears protruding double the distance from my head than the other. To this day I can keep a smoke beghind one ear, but it will fall instantly from the other. Maybe he was like me and had big (perpendicular) ears as a child. </p>

<p>What foundation does your mockery have other than you liking to point, mock and laugh at people to make sure no one takes them seriously? What are you trying to hide/coverup?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>:)</p>

<p>Yes, because me criticizing your line of reasoning <em>must</em> mean I&#39;m trying to &quot;hide&quot; something. See, this here&#39;s exactly what&#39;s wrong with conspiracy communities. You have your &quot;inquiry&quot;, and I agree, that&#39;s fine, but <em>anything I say</em> to the contrary is immediately met by you accusing me of a conspiracy! How is that logical? How is that reasonable? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) the guy&#39;s ear sticks out in his booking photo (and others thereafter) unlike all other photos of him before, and...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The guy has pretty long hair. Maybe he just has a lock of hair stuck behind his ear? Maybe one photo isn&#39;t <em>exactly</em> at the same angle or perspective as the other? Maybe any number of things, all of which are many times more reasonable to assume than that he is being drugged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) there is such a thing as a scopolamine patch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there are also such things as lizards, aliens (probably...) and costumes. Therefor, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to put those facts together and conclude that he <em>might</em> be a an alien lizard in a human-costume.</p>

<p>I mean, you&#39;re not <em>honestly</em> trying to ridicule <em>me</em> just because you don&#39;t believe what I&#39;m saying, are you? Because that would be doing exactly what you just accused <em>me</em> of doing, and you wouldn&#39;t do that, would you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>scopolamine does have the effect which relates to his state of being at his arraignment (couldn&#39;t even speak his own name) and the stupefied look on his face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is a clearly disturbed person who has just spent days in jail for a pretty horrific crime. I would be much more worried if he appeared well-rested and clear-minded. As for the rest, is it more reasonable to assume someone dosed him with a drug you Googled off the internet, than that he simply got hold of ordinary narcotics while in jail that made him groggy and unfocused?</p>

<p>Again, far-fetched deliberate conspiracy? Or ordinary circumstances that are all perfectly easily explainable?</p>

<p>You can &quot;speculate&quot; and &quot;inquire&quot; about whatever you want, but it&#39;s utterly pointless until you get <em>some</em> facts to go on. Actual conspiracies aren&#39;t unearthed by people on the internet going &quot;hey, that guy&#39;s hair went from light auburn in one photo, to slightly lighter auburn in another. He&#39;s clearly a body-double!&quot; when the fact that different photos capture different lighting angles is much more realistic.</p>

<p>So, in short, my theory isn&#39;t <em>actually</em> any less credible than yours, and you don&#39;t get to tell me I&#39;m wrong if I don&#39;t get to tell you the same thing.</p>

<p>You question the assumptions, and you&#39;re not trolling. I question <em>your</em> assumptions, and I&#39;m trolling?</p>

<p>My point, from the beginning and onwards, was calling you out on criticizing anyone else for questioning you, while pretending to be untouchable when questioning someone else. Why can you &quot;speculate&quot; on why your theory is right, but other people can&#39;t &quot;speculate&quot; on why it&#39;s wrong?</p>

<p>You&#39;re a hypocrite, that&#39;s all. I made a sarcastic example to help you understand it, but you clearly didn&#39;t. Instead, you started attacking me and my motives, and calling me names instead of defending your position. That&#39;s just plain pathetic.</p>

<p>Either accept that other people point out the flaws and holes in your &quot;theory&quot;, or stop pretending you&#39;re not making any claims. If you&#39;re not making a claim, what is it you&#39;re defending against these people&#39;s criticism?</p>

<p>You believe there was more than one shooter because a) a couple of people say they remember multiple shooters, b) some people on the internet say so, and/or c) the mainstream media says there was only one?</p>

<p>So, this conspiracy that&#39;s supposed to manipulate the news all the time is so utterly incompetent that they can&#39;t prevent or mitigate direct evidence of their manipulations, but they can easily bury the truth about a convoluted false flag attack?</p>

<p>This makes no sense. Seriously, stop and think for a second, if you controlled the media, it would be a trivial matter to discredit any claims evidence like the (still unsourced) quote.</p>

<p>Even if the conspiracy exists and makes mistakes, there would still be scant evidence as they would still have the power to immediately suppress/discredit anything that did come to light.</p>

<p>Your theory is logically flawed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When VICE initially asked me to go down to Colombia to dig into this Scopolamine story, I was pretty excited. I had only a vague understanding of the drug, but the idea of a substance that renders a person incapable of exercising free-will seemed liked a recipe for hilarity and the YouTube hall of fame. I even spent a little time brainstorming the various ways I could transport some of it back to the states and had a pretty good list going of different ways to utilize it on my buddies. The original plan was for me to sample the drug myself to really get an idea of the effect it had on folks. 
.
The producer and camera man had flew down to Bogota ahead of me to confirm some meetings and start laying down the groundwork. By the time I arrived a few days later, things had changed dramatically. Their first few days in the country had apparently been such a harrowing montage of freaked-out dealers and unimaginable horror stories about Scopolamine that we decided I was absolutely not going to be doing the drug. All elements of humor and novelty were rapidly stripped away during my first few days in town. After meeting only a couple people with firsthand experience, the story took a far darker turn than we ever could have imagined, and the Scopolamine pranks I had originally imagined pulling on my friends seemed beyond naive and absurd.</p>

<p>By the time we were wrapping things up and preparing to leave the country, I couldn’’t wait to get as far away from Colombia and that drug as possible. Apologies for a fleeting moment of sincerity, but looking back, I’m pretty proud of the work we did down there. This story, and the people who tell it, truly deserve to be heard.
