<p>In short typically Turkish quakes are complimentary of events prior to Japanese sequencing (judging by my own personal observations). </p>

<p><strong>This could mean a 7.5- 8.0 mag for an offshore Eastern Japan near Namie Prefecture within 48 hours</strong>. <em>I think magnitude would drop after too long a period of prolonged stagnation</em></p>

<p><em>I expected an event in Nepal as its still on watch</em>- With the Philippians being a seconded release point. Yet the additional quake in turkey at that magnitude seems very off base for what is standard cause and effect via my observations. </p>

<p>It appears that <a href="http://www.solarham.net/latest_imagery/211b.htm">Ch15</a> is exhibiting a very dense wind stream on earth with ch16 following closely behind it. </p>

<p>With the addition of the heightened activity from 2665&#39;s M2.8 cme I imagine we&#39;ve yet to see the last of this seismic series. </p>

<p>This would be as earth resides back to a holding period. <a href="http://www.solarham.net/latest_imagery/211b.htm">Likely post CH16 passing by the lens.</a> (5 days) Yet, Prior to the sunspots on the east lens becoming geo-active. As that would also potentially postpone the activity and scale of events I am expecting; <a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">Solar Winds</a> may be slightly elevated at 325- 450 km/s at that time... I imagine more so 340km/s +/-</p>

<p>Id say Japan Nepal and the Philippians should maybe be on moderate alert until all this geomagnetic storming and solar ejecta has surpassed. </p>

<p>Sorry just not sitting right. The eastern jolt certainly piqued my interests being the eq&#39;s scale and range. </p>

<p>It just didn&#39;t feel right not to make this post-</p>

<p>Its a long shot. But its literally a large enough possibility that I wanted to post on it. (as a damned if you <em>do</em> or <em>don&#39;t</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Maybe 30% chance?</strong> <em>So not high</em>-</p>

<p>Yet im no computer, and this is more so my general consensus via my own unique and personal / past observations...</p>

<p>So I doubt it will happen, but i am fully intrigued by this recent activity...</p>

<p>Again just wouldn&#39;t feel right not to mention it. As again Its more so just a thought on the recent sequence taking place. </p>

<p>Really need to get this model up asap. Don&#39;t like making these calls really. :(</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>

<strong>CHANCE OF STORMS</strong>: For the 4th day in a row, Earth is inside a stream of solar wind flowing from a large hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere. The steady pressure of this stream is doing little, however, to disturb our planet&#39;s magnetic field. NOAA forecasters say the chance of a geomagnetic storm on July 24th is only 15%. Free: Aurora Alerts</p>

<p><strong>MASSIVE EXPLOSION ON THE FARSIDE OF THE SUN:</strong> On Sunday July 23rd, a spectacular CME emerged from the farside of the sun. Coronagraphs onboard the orbiting Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) tracked the fast-moving cloud as it billowed into space:</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>NASA&#39;s STEREO-A spacecraft, which has a partial view of the sun&#39;s farside, identified the source of the blast as active sunspot AR2665, familiar to readers of Spaceweather.com who watched the behemoth cross the Earthside of the sun earlier this month. STEREO-A observed an intense flash of extreme UV radiation from the sunspot&#39;s magnetic canopy:</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p><strong>The intensity of the flash suggests (but does not prove) that the underlying flare might have been the most intense kind: X-class.</strong> <em>(I&#39;d guess M-7)</em></p>

<p><strong>If this explosion had occurred 2 weeks ago when the huge sunspot was facing Earth, we would be predicting strong geomagnetic storms in the days ahead</strong>. Instead, the CME is racing away from our planet ... and directly toward Mars. Compared to Earth, the Red Planet is currently on the opposite side of the sun, and apparently in the crosshairs of this CME. Mars rovers Curiosity and Opportunity might be observing the effects of a solar storm later this week.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, yesterday&#39;s farside explosion occurred on the 5th anniversary of another significant farside event: The Solar Superstorm of July 23, 2012.  That superstorm, which has been compared to the historic Carrington Event of 1859, could have caused widespread power blackouts if it had not missed our planet.</p>

<p>Sunspot AR2665 will be back on the Earthside of the sun a little more than a week from now. If the sunspot remains active, it could bring a new round of geomagnetic storms and auroras to our planet in early August. Stay tuned. Free: Solar Flare Alerts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to leave this comment. This is a 5 day warning. What I meant is that ch16 would be geo active 48 hours. Re charging the m2.8&#39;s left over charging. 
The next 2 days we may see activity... Ergo 48 hours was the ticker. Not the expectancy. Although the 5.6 did take place. We should wait now to see if the bz component tips south from the &#39;reported&#39; x class cme. As that likely also raised the likelihood of an expected higher magnitude quake in the japaneses region. </p>

<p>There were 8 (eight) 5+ earthquakes in Japan in the last 30 days. 11 if you expand the area just a bit. So your statement is pure bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres an escalation of midscale activity. Solar winds are still above holding due to aia showing false positioning.</p>

<p>This was intended to be a 5 day warning. 48 hours was the time assessed / estimated for ch16 to clear the lens. (Which should have now happened). So as winds slow to holding levels. 325km/s +/-. We should expect more moderate activity in the region. </p>
