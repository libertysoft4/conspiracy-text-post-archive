        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is just a theory I have heard and after thinking about it sounds interesting.  </p>

<p>So the Fed is rising rates and we are in a mostly stale market. The volatility index is running at very low levels even for this time of year, many thing&#39;s really aren&#39;t adding up. I think the wealthy are waiting for the central banks to commit to directly pouring in trillions into the stock market. Some already have started to buy stocks but what I think what they really want is for QE money to become buy stock money. </p>

<p>QE is already nearly insane as is, but pouring trillions into buying stocks of big blue chip and other stocks is nothing short of madness. It will likely result in a mega sky rocket of the markets followed by a sudden crash that might very well make 2008 look controlled and calm. </p>

<p>After seeing Trump get elected along with the whole 2016 election it seems things get more extreme each time as the NWO works toward it&#39;s goal of a true one world government. I think the target with the next crash will mostly be a one world currency that will mostly be digital but also have some kind of way to use it in 3rd world places or out in the sticks. </p>

<p>My guess is that current values won&#39;t maintain past 3 years though when everything is full of so much fraud no one can really tell what&#39;s going to happen when. Trump is going to be like bush the fall guy and will play perfectly into the establishment/NWO agenda to discredit values that don&#39;t fit into their plan. </p>

<p>I have said this before and will again I think Trump is going to be the &quot;Hillary&quot; of the right. As in they will find quite a bit of dirt but then make BS up so that it&#39;s because &quot;he didn&#39;t know better&quot; or the like so that he can kill the unwanted right leaning ideas that are anti NWO. It also has the effect of getting many more liberal thinkers in line though some outsiders will resist but most people will disregard what they say due to how bad things will likely get once the crap storm visits the markets. </p>

<p>I never thought I would be saying this but stuff like the DOW could go from 20k to 30k or 35k in the next two years before things go for the downside due to the level of support Central banks have given and are talking about giving to the markets to keep prices up.</p>

<p>We could be very well meeting a situation where the United States ends up like Japan because I think the bill is going to be due at some point for all the fraud and tricks used to prop things up. When that happens it&#39;s hard to say how bad it will get, but odds are it would be at lest in the same ball park as 2008 if not worse. If it&#39;s worse then it does open the door for one world currency talks even though more centralizing only makes things worse but somehow they will sell people on it.  </p>

<p>That is just something I have thought about lately and odds are I am wrong as it&#39;s just a hypothesis of mine but I haven&#39;t seen many talk about this possibly so I thought I would make a post on it. </p>

<p>The difference being that like the 90s tech crash it followed several years of prodding individuals to buy stock and become &quot;the millionaire next door.&quot; </p>

<p>This crash might be going after the pension funds invested in mutual funds and large ownership in some essential businesses, like power companies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody knows because it&#39;s impossible to say how far it&#39;ll go. Will the US default? Will the dollar lose most of it&#39;s value, or will the USD become completely worthless paper through hyperinflation? Will debt-based instruments(bonds) collapse? What about equity instruments(stocks) are they safe? Are digital/crypto currencies safe or could those all be wiped out too?</p>

<p>Nobody honestly knows. Every single aspect of the economy is so engineered and &quot;they&quot; have control over far more than most people realize.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the safest bet is physical items that have value. Property is usually always safe if you have that much liquid capital. The other recommendations are always the usual survivalist stuff like food, water, precious metals, but IMO there is no right answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>2008 was a fake crash.  It was never allowed to play out.  Zombie economics since then.  They set base rates to zero - unprecedented in modern (1600s+ onwards) economics.  Base rates in the UK were never below 2% from 1694 to Feb 2009.  They&#39;ve never been ABOVE 0.5% since March 2009.  These are unprecedented times. The next crash will be the real one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see the DOW or any other index getting much higher than it is now.  They can&#39;t keep printing money and devaluing currency at this rate.  IR increases will put a lid on stocks.  Everything is over-valued as it is.  The only reason stocks have gone higher is because people aren&#39;t saving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think about the recent development of millions of Americans using their SS# to offset old debt? The payments don&#39;t stick for a lot of people, but they also do not reverse, and the money still shows on many corporations systems, even though the balance rebounds, if that makes sense. This all goes very very deep, touching on the illegal placing of the common wealth to which we are all rightful inheritors into private &quot;trust&quot; accounts tied to your SS# and birth certificate (which is a bond that you can look up the value of through a stock broker if you want). I am very excited about it all as, if it happened, it would eliminate national debt as well as individual debt, which has to do with the stupid complicated method that they use to turn your real value  and the value of your portion of the common wealth into fed reserve notes,  thereby maintaining the farcical fractional reserve system we are burdened with today. </p>

<p>But, yeah, would something like that factor into your equation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I understand it people are trying to get the fed to pay bills using there routing number. Sounds like fraud to me and from what I have been reading if there was a real account why don&#39;t people try to wire money out of it instead of a ACH? </p>

<p>Still the statement they released on matter was much weaker than I expected. So I can&#39;t %100 dismiss it at this time, but I also plan on staying away from trying this myself. I fully expect people to get screwed trying this with returned payment fees and what not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know of it and think that if it&#39;s the real deal that it&#39;s more like stock options on people than it is an actual trust people can use to pay for stuff. </p>

<p>I honestly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they had a system to trade social security numbers as a bundled backed Security like they did with houses. I could be wrong but what I think what people are finding is a financial instrument being traded than an actual trust that in theory is meant for them. </p>

<p>If what people are saying is true about the trust system I highly doubt they would let us normal joes ever use it because they are willing to commit fraud and what ever it took because if such a thing was really proven to work the system would fall apart and that wouldn&#39;t be allowed. </p>
