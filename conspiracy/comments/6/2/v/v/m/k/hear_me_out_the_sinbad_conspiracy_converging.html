        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I remember the day I said to my boyfriend, &quot;Remember Shazaam!?&quot; and he said, &quot;You mean Kazaam?&quot; I responded, &quot;No It&#39;s Shazaam, starring Sinbad? (you know? that goofy comedian that was only famous for this one one as a silly genie in kid&#39;s movie at the precipice of my young adolescence?) and he said &quot;No, that movie was called Kazaam and it was Shaq.&quot; Me: &quot;I don&#39;t remember any movie called Kazaam with Shaq, I remember Shazaam- with Sinbad. You must be confused with Space Jam (the only movie I remember from the 90&#39;s starring a basketball player!)&quot;</p>

<p>Fast Forward: I SPECIFICALLY remember Shazaam. I remember how that movie was seemingly written for him and his goofy comedian like ways from All-That. I remember how his earrings were so fitting. I remember his name SINBAD on the poster like, how fitting, this actor even has a genie sounding name- these are memories I have!</p>

<p>Now, I can&#39;t let this go, how could I have such vivid memories of something that never happened? I have a photographic and audiographic memory, I can recount things play by play. I watched clips of Kazaam and I remember those scenes with SINBAD and he was actually funny, because of his exaggerated expressions weird quirks. I remember thinking how silly of a name Shazaam was, and how on there were 3 letters on each side of the Z- balanced. I also remember thinking Sinbad looked almost middle eastern, which was even more fitting to play a genie. But then he had these comical raps, and realizing in my young mind, oh, he&#39;s actually part African, this makes sense. I remember in my young advanced mind watching that genie movie in the theater that I appreciated how his race was ambiguous. I could on, and on, and on!</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think this is strong evidence that time is breaking down and timelines are converging. I grew up on a different timeline where Sinbad starred in Shazaam as the highlight of his career.</p>

<p>I also research time travelers quite extensively along with unacknowledged special access programs, and wonder quite seriously if Sinbad, previously David Atkins, was involved in a secret government program that involved time travel (like Andy Basiago) was almost discharged for going AWOL in another timeline, and screwed everything up... and they gave him a bullshit excuse for discharging him like &quot;parking his car in the wrong position?!&quot; (REALLY??? That&#39;s what the wiki says. Sure sounds like BS to me) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinbad_(comedian)#Military_service">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinbad_(comedian)#Military_service</a></p>

<p><em>TLDR: Sinbad was a time traveler in a secret government program of the military and screwed up, now our timelines are converging as time breaks down...</em> therefore MANDELA EFFECT. <strong>Sinbad missed out on the highlight of his career (that people still remember him doing from another timeline, and dumb Shaq ruined his movie, because HE&#39;S NOT EVEN FUNNY.)</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE: This video was published today. It feels too real for me. Anyone else remember???

    <div class="md"><p>I like how in the modern age, instead of accepting that we misremember something, or just are confused, we have to come up with a whole conspiracy about time-line convergence. Because there&#39;s no possible way we could possibly just be misremembering something right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t believe in it. The whole mandela pseudo science thing just seems so narcissistic to me.</p>

<p>I remember the Berenstain Bears as the Berenstein Bears. I found my old books, and was like &quot;oh, I was wrong, that&#39;s funny, kids think the darndest things!&quot; But it seems like people believe their memory to be so infallible, that instead of accepting they just misinterpreted or misremember ed something, there is some sort of conspiracy afoot</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t believe it, that&#39;s fine. If we both understand that this could be false memory, then we both can understand that this could be true memory. What&#39;s more likely- who cares? But I&#39;d really love for you to step outside, and come back in, then have someone try to convince you that was a fake memory. I studied epistemology and ontology in school, and have a very progressive ontological worldview. I believe alternate timelines and other possible worlds is a part of nature- so why wouldn&#39;t the prevalent mandala effects be possibly the result of converging timelines? I believe it&#39;s more likely then a huge mass of people coincidentally all simultaneously having the same wrong memory.  I just don&#39;t see how that&#39;s narcissistic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m willing to consider the idea, but here&#39;s why I find it narcissistic.</p>

<p>We have two possible scenarios:</p>

<p>Scenario A: A large group of us misremember a man that spent the entirety of the 90s dressing up in colorful flashy shirts with hood earrings as a genie. In this scenario was have to admit that we are wrong and that the human memory is not as infallible as we would like to believe because if we are wrong about this then what else are we wrong about?</p>

<p>Scenario B: Instead of accepting that we were wrong, we rally us and everyone else that was wrong behind the idea that &quot;No! We are not wrong, we&#39;re simply from a different timeline.&quot; </p>

<p>Which sounds more realistic to you? That you were mistaken? Or that you and everyone else in the world that remembers Sinbad as a genie are here from a different timeline where the only tangible difference is the title of a few books, and shitty B movie&#39;s main actor? </p>

<p>I&#39;m so harsh on this because it&#39;s a very slippery slope. Eventually everyone will have an excuse. &quot;I&#39;m not wrong, that&#39;s how it was, I&#39;m just from a different timeline.&quot; It&#39;s such a cop out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One; that&#39;s a false dichotomy- you never accept in either of those scenarios that converging timelines is very real and possible.

    <div class="md"><p>OH SHIT!  Owned.</p>

<p>We are living in the age of narcissism. This phenomenon is hardly surprising. What does it say about a culture where you can prove an idea 100 percent wrong with evidence, and a portion of that population will ban together and pool their resources to oppose the idea. </p>

<p>Maybe this is just human nature. We are programmed for conflict and dependent on allies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In debate certain parameters need to be established. We need to agree to the meaning of certain terms and what not. If you use that type of argument it is impossible to even start a dialogue. You are using circular logic. Thats cool for thinking in a bubble. Religious people do it all the time. If your belief system relies on the machine of god that is time travel how can we even communicate?

    <div class="md"><p>It is because all black people looked and acted the same to your 90&#39;s child brain. Sinbad is the name of a swords and sandals hero that dealt with genies and shit. Your brain is just firing wrong. Yes, a group of people&#39;s brains can misfire the same way. It can be as simple as seeing a commercial for Kazzam that followed an ad for the Sindbad show. The information was saved wrong in your head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i never saw swords and sandals, not sure what that is. never saw the sinbad show ever. </p>

<p>I just SPECIFICALLY remember the movie, and my reactions to it. I remeber thinking that Sinbad did not act like a &quot;sterotyped&quot; black person, and I actually thought he was middle eastern... until the rap scene... and then I thought &quot;oh, this is the sterotyped black person thing. i didnt even realize he was african american!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sword and sandals is a genre of movie/tv. In the 90&#39;s there was Hercules, Xena, Sinbad and a few others. You didn&#39;t have to see anything specifically. Sinbad is like Aladdin or Ali Baba. Its just some cliche you hear in passing about genies and magic carpets and stuff.
It&#39;s just your brain farting. There is also something called dreaming where your brain just throws things together. When I was a child I would often asleep during  a movie and dream my own endings. I do that with books too. Trust me. Your brain is fragile. You may one day lose your mind to dementia. We seem to be in denial about that possibility (generally speaking).   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also have a memory like this, but it goes the other way. I was at the book festival talking with the teacher aid, miss wyant. She was holding one of the books cause she was gonna read it to us after we got back to the class room. At one point she reads the title as bearensteen bears and I questioned why it&#39;s pronounced like that when the a makes an a or ahh sound. She told me no that&#39;s and e. As I looked closer the letter seemed to shift between a cursive e to an a, where it finally settled. When I still argued that it&#39;s an a, she took a closer look and agreed that it was indeed an a. Then she went on to tell me &quot;thats just how it&#39;s pronounced.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you create in the moment and what you create in the moment also alters the past.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t stress that enough with the M. E.</p>

<p>We are always in the present moment. That&#39;s where creation happens. The past is a perception created in the present.  You may have seen one thing in the past/present,  that in another time you altered.</p>

<p>This alteration of the past is become more noticed lately and that is because in the present we are shifting, this alters the past we create.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not so much converging timelines, like you are thinking, it has more to do with alterations of perception about a past that is not an absolute. Especially with the similarities between what you altered. Two somewhat funny black entertainers with the titles slightly different. You altered the original to accommodate your preferences. </p>

<p>This is not that unusual. On average a person recalls many memories in one day of a past event and we alter them all in someway. Even with a photographic memory, even the slightest alteration changes the memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your brain is a funny thing, and it is not infallible. Its actually very easy to see how a bunch of useless memory can get mixed together. Sinbad was known for his crazy attire. If you grew up in the 90s, you saw this on tv at least once. He did a movie where he played a secret service agent. You watched it once, it sucked, and forgot it. Around the same time, kazaam was released. Another shitty 90s movie, but this one was a little better and you remembered it. The fork in the road is when you realize that you took sinbads goofy clothes and shitty movie, mixed it with kazaam starring shaq, and confused yourself into thinking shazaam was ever a thing, do you admit to your own probability of error, or do you double down and perform absurd mental gymnastics in an attempt to be &quot;right&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember watching First Kid. Thinking, Sinbad (from Shazaam) he was actually more entertaining as a genie. If he never starred in that movie- I&#39;d be surprised if anyone would remember who he was! haha... I remember only liking First Kid becasue I liked Shazaam. </p>

<p>I also admit the probability of error, there are many times I get wrong. But I also believe timeline convegernce is a very real thing (not absurd mental gymnastics at all) and I beleive my account and others are real evidence in support of this possiblily. </p>

<p>If it is that hard for you to entertain the concept of timeline convergance and the collasping of time, then I would say your brain is an unforunate thing... full of useless things all mixed together and confused... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say its hard for me to entertain. Its pretty easy to. &quot;Okay alternate universe where a sinbad genie movie exists and the huge volume of intricate things that that entails.&quot; Its also easy to see it for what it is, plain and simple. So your gonna attempt to take a dig at me when the only thing you are trying to hold together your argument with, is nothing but useless bullshit trivia category nonsense? Thats your proof of timeline convergence? What this is is nothing more than the pseudo scientific equivalent of delusional religious beliefs of heaven or a &quot;somewhere else.&quot; Do you really wanna know why your mind as a child found sinbad so funny as a genie?

<p>if its not hard to entertain... then why call it &quot;absurd mental gymnastics&quot;? </p>

<p>in my mind there are two possibilities: Shazaam really happened (therefore it must be on an alternate timeline). ORRRRR Shazaam never happened (and hundreds, maybe thousands of people all remember the same wrong thing like a mass hulincination.)</p>

<p>I never said I had proof, I have evidence and that is my memory. </p>

So you have to be aware you are going to be subjected to public opinion. This is all just my opinion. Im just a dude on reddit. But im the fucking public too, and my opinion is i wish people would stop spreading bullshit like this and flat earth like garbage at a time when there is some no shit foul play going on. There are parents out there, desperately hoping against hope that they will see their children again., when in reality they are dead or worse. And these parents are fucking powerless to do anything about it because of ties involving powerful players. We have created a world, where all the worst kinds of people have a fucking nuclear arsenal, and i just see more and more &quot;oh shazaam guys!&quot;</p>
