Do you seriously think they would let someone in there who would change things? It is just sickening that people are thinking that corrupt ass bitch Hillary (or Obama for 8 years of sellout) - if elected - things would be better.</p>

<p>THEY ARE ALL SELLOUTS. Does not matter one lick who you choose. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the idea divide and conquer? America is completely polarized and everyone is playing right into their hands. </p>

<p>This sub has been hijacked by fucking idiots the last few months. I can&#39;t stand the concept of people thinking they&#39;re posting meaningful articles on this sub anymore and are part of a resistance. It&#39;s just /news </p>

<p>Edit: Just look at these comments. My point is exactly proven. People thinking one side is the way to go and the other is wrong. It&#39;s disgusting. Compromise? It&#39;s all a shit show? Get these political dickbags out of here who think their opinion is worth something. You&#39;re literally just proving this thread right. Baaaaaaaaaaahhhhh (sheep sound)</p>

<p>It makes me sick to my stomach that you people are arguing the point I&#39;m trying to make and don&#39;t even realize it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a hacked account. The poster has submitted about sports and video games for the last 2 years without a single mention of politics at all. Their last post before this was five days ago and again not political. </p>

<p>None of their submissions are political either prior. Nor any conspiracy post. </p>

<p>Now all of a sudden after a five day gap this user has became angry as hell at politicians for the first time ever and found his way to conspiracy to rally the troops. </p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m not buying it...sorry. This shit is getting blatant and out of control.  Everyday there&#39;s a new mystery user posting here trying to incite this subreddit and turn us on each other.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s never posted here before ever yet he&#39;s asking where to find subs that are like how it used to be. Get the fuck out of here with that. </p>

<p>A lot of people on that sub aren&#39;t on the &quot;Trump is Hitler&quot; train, and being anti Trump but open to new ideas, what they point out either positive or negative about Trump always makes me rethink the whole pizza.</p>

<p>People need to be vigilant and aware, we can&#39;t let those Mafia fucks take over the next social movement, it&#39;s coming and it better be in our terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a fair assessment, and it has certainly changed to some degree. I think the signal&#39;s still there, but the noise has gotten louder. </p>

<p>On the Christian stuff, I think that&#39;s subsided a fair bit. We got tougher about removing posts that were simply quoting scripture or sermonizing, but we still allow people who want to respectfully discuss religion. There&#39;s some Trump supporters and leaners there, but I think it, too, represents a small minority. When they do come, they&#39;re either respectful or get shown the door pretty quickly, often without direct mod intervention. </p>

People have to stop being misled by what things are named and spend a little goddamned time looking at what these fuckbags actually do.  (The EPA is just as corrupt as any other government agency and EPA officials will do anything for that side money and those sweet high-paying corporate gigs waiting just on the other side of the revolving door.)  </p>

<p>That&#39;s some ignorant shit. As a kid, I remember helping to spread the lime that we had to buy by the ton to save their farm from the damage of acid rain. I remember measuring the PH of the rain with both strips and electronic meters with results as low as 4. As a direct result of EPA&#39;s regulations, the rain is no longer acidic and the plants grow normally again. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/acid-rain/History">charts don&#39;t lie.</a> It&#39;s sadden that people spout garbarge that they know nothing about . What in it for you to see our air and rivers polluted again? Why do you get off of spreading false information?</p>

<p>If our sub has been infiltrated, it&#39;s not shareblue that we should be worried about. </p>

<p>That Russia launched an information warfare on us. Here some facts we know about that:</p>

<li><p>Putin has made public <a href="http://time.com/4422723/putin-russia-hillary-clinton/">his dislike of Hillary.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20160228_art009.pdf">“Gerasimov Doctrine”</a> Russia would use information warfare in a 4 to 1 ratio over traditional military tactics.?</p></li>
<li><p>Or the 2014  In <a href="http://www.bipartisanreport.com/2017/03/22/rachel-maddow-uncovers-fake-bernie-sanders-page-run-by-russians-details/">the Russian journal, “Military Thought”,</a>  ‘If you’re gonna use information warfare to confuse, demoralize, divide, and distract a rival country, you do not just do it in wartime, <strong>you have to do it all the time, or it doesn’t work.</strong>’</p></li>
<li><p>Or in Feb of 2016 when a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2017/01/18/russias-radical-new-strategy-for-information-warfare/?utm_term=.1c3e177f65ae">Kremin official warned us</a>, “<strong>I’m warning you: We are at the verge of having ‘something’ in the information arena, which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals.</strong>”</p></li>

<p>There are shills on both sides. We have to be vigilant and think critically to find the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t been in a long time to be honest. Floating around r/conspiracy everything is pretty tame. I mean.. right now the entire internet is team hillary vs team trump. It&#39;s all pretty engrossing. From my perspective we are at end game here. Financial collapse coinciding with Civil War and World War. It&#39;s going to be pointless and impossible in understanding who, what, why, how. Just have to survive if it&#39;s your destiny and accept that the lord of this world is the lord of this world because of it&#39;s willingness to commit evil and destruction no other sociopath is capable of. And still these peon sociopaths will try. Trump is a narcissist and looks capable and smart against the mid tier peon power structure. But as he pushes he will start to come face to face with who&#39;s really in control. And that power fully intends to turn this earth into a nuclear wasteland when the time comes.</p>

<p>The financial collapse is a definite, just waiting. </p>

<p>Civil &amp; WW3 is only if we allow it to happen. The suits in congress/senate/banks will not take up arms and fight. We as citizens need to kill each other to turn this into a war.</p>

<p>Time will tell if it goes that far. I&#39;m hopeful it won&#39;t. TPTB will try. They will hire contractors to pose as civilians and start open firing on crowds. They will manufacture a civil war, just like they manufactured 9/11. The question is, with our current level of data &amp; Internet, will we fall for it again? </p>

<p>You and I might not be on the front lines.. But &#39;we&#39; will. It&#39;ll be hard to avoid. It&#39;s just protest taken to another level.

    <div class="md"><p>The only way massive change can happen, is first within the individual.</p>

<p>I would say the best way to create change, is to not worry about what the collective is doing, and focus on what you are doing (or not doing).</p>

<p>Work on bettering yourself and live through example.</p>

<p>I hope this doesn&#39;t sound too preachy or too non-action based. I certainly don&#39;t mean to say that you shouldn&#39;t protest or follow what sort of action feels right to you.</p>

<p>I mean to say that I have a lot of activist friends who are solely focused on getting other people to change and they are burning themselves out by living in perpetual anger.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gotten so bad within my group of friends, that they are starting to turn on one another and they are tearing themselves apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Stopped any wars? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t start any wars, which is better than half of our presidents. He inherited bullshit wars from Bush, but once you&#39;re at war you can&#39;t just walk away. It&#39;s more complicated than war=bad president. </p>

<p>Decreased the deficit? </p>

<p>Yes, by nearly $1 trillion since Bush&#39;s last year. But Bush era tax cuts for the rich are the main driving force behind the deficit, and the Republican congress is responsible for upholding those, not the president. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Increased education? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does that even mean? He increased <em>funding</em> for education, yes. But there&#39;s no way to measure something as vague as &quot;increase education&quot;. What are you looking for, test scores? Hours spent in class? Money spent?</p>

<p>Graduation rates hit an all-time high under Obama. Education experts rated him pretty highly. He did pretty well with education. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Made an impact on poverty and crime? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under Obama, the poverty rate dropped the most it has since 1968.</p>

<p>Crime rates have been steadily falling since 1991. That continued throughout Obama&#39;s 8 years.</p>

<p>So, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diminished the growth of the largest prison system with most inmates per capita? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It peaked the year Obama took office, and has declined ever since. That peak is due to Bush-era policy, though. The numbers in a president&#39;s first year on most metrics is due to what happened before they got there. Overall his term showed the first decreases in decades. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Opened up the surveillance state?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he did not. I am not happy about his performance there, but again most of that was just continuation of Bush&#39;s actions. He didn&#39;t start the surveillance, just didn&#39;t stop it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>not sure how you personally measure the performance of a President but I&#39;d say by most commonly accepted measures he is one of the worst. If not the worst in the last 80 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And where do you get that idea? He&#39;s ranked around the middle in pretty much every poll I&#39;ve seen. Which is pretty common for recent presidents. They tend to move up or down after a decade or so, as the context and results of their actions are seen. His approval ratings were around the same as the previous 7 presidents - his lowest is higher than all of those, but his highest was lower than all of their&#39;s. </p>

<p>But of the things I&#39;m most concerned with, health care and the economy, he did great. The ACA saved my life. Bush destroyed the economy, and Obama fixed it (as much as was possible). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the rub. It&#39;s possible to subscribe to conspiracy theories (that keep proving true over and over again), to be anti-establishment, to be anti-NWO, to be anti-Clinton/Obama/Bush, to be anti-deep state, to be anti-bilderberg, anti-davos, anti-Putin, anti-facist, anti-dictorial power , anti-war and be anti-Trump BUT still totally appreciate many of the things that Trump is (if even in theater or show) standing against and being attacked by.</p>

<p>The truth is Trump is hated by establishment GOP Conservatives (Bush, Cheney, Rhinos, McCain), hated by Democrats, hated by MSM, hated by Bilderbergers, hated by Davos, hated by NATO, hated by the EU, hated by the UN, hated by Soros, hated by the Elite rich like Bill Gates, Carlos Slim, David Tepper, Mark Cuban, Seth Klarman, Howard Marks, Bill Gross, Buffet, Jeff Bezos, Zuckerturd etc. etc. etc. They are all openly or indirectly attacking him. Maybe it&#39;s all a big show? A big plan by the real power structure to bring about civil war and/or WWIII along with a financial collapse? Maybe the whole thing is a giant conspiracy to bring about a dictatorship in the US that the entire government, GOP and Dems REALLY wanted all along? But it doesn&#39;t matter because like WWE wrestling you can&#39;t help but enjoy it even though you know it&#39;s &#39;fake&#39;. Giving you those programmed feels. Maybe the Satanic power structure planned Bilderberg, the EU, NATO, the Middle Eastern wars so we would all be mad and except a dictator? In which case they win. They are more disciplined and devoted to power than any person or group in the world and so deserve it. Yes Israel seems to love Trump.. but Trump is an anti-semitic Hitler.. so. </p>

<p>The peons that make up the majority here on reddit, slamming Trump, crying &#39;Muhh Rushin&#39; and everything else... you automatically put yourself in the camp of everything that is despised by what Trump is being attacked by. So if you care you should at least give some attention to that. If you want to really expose Trump as an evil doing conman then you need to contrast it with everything else that should be exposed that just so happens to be attacking him. Sorry this is such a difficult task.</p>

<p>Maybe Trump is a pedophile who drinks the blood of children? Maybe he has a dungeon full of women in the basement of Trump tower? Those would be some X&#39;s on his profile. But i would suggest that whatever the establishment has on Trump they KNOW he has on them. And if they dare go there they give him OPEN opportunity to do the same. And he is a vandal. He will tear down the entire power structure if he goes down. And so we get all this theater, where they try and block him or neuter his power with all this stupid BS. If they go after for anything really evil he does shit like bring all Bill Clinton&#39;s rape victims to a debate. That shuts that down real fast. He is a vandal. They know this.</p>

<p>So good luck with the Trump is a Rushin shite. The MSM and whoever it is you think you are supporting will leave you there to fight the pointless battle on your own as they move on to the next toothless attack. </p>

<p>I have to agree, this is the only appealing thing I liked Trump for.  After he filled his cabinet with the same neocon-light Beltway insiders and millionaires, I paused my perhaps naive support for him.  When he continued the drone strikes without Congressional approval, and continued the policy of playing God and deciding to kill other human beings, I really began to question President Trump&#39;s real motivations.</p>

<p>I think this is all theater now, and Trump&#39;s job is to drop the hammer down and bring in the military police state that has been created by the last 16 years.  This is what the power structure has been planning since 9/11, and they now have their catalyst in place and ready to move.</p>

<p>The Russian thing is what I&#39;m still on the fence about.  I find it incredibly difficult to believe that when the USSR fell, that the same bankster cartel that has been pretty much unopposed in almost every country, and who were the ones funding and trying to bring about this collapse for decades there, wouldn&#39;t just walk away, and not get their tentacles into the markets and power.</p>

<p>The name Putin or PUT-IN seems to confirm this.  They are all on the same team I believe.  I don&#39;t see the US government and their banking masters spending billions of dollars and decades trying to overthrow the government, and then stopping.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I have to agree, this is the only appealing thing I liked Trump for. After he filled his cabinet with the same neocon-light Beltway insiders and millionaires, I paused my perhaps naive support for him. When he continued the drone strikes without Congressional approval, and continued the policy of playing God and deciding to kill other human beings, I really began to question President Trump&#39;s real motivations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. The war bullshit and drones pretty much says it all. That doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t a sociopath that is on their team.. Just the larger sociopathic evil team they are all apart of. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The name Putin or PUT-IN seems to confirm this. They are all on the same team I believe. I don&#39;t see the US government and their banking masters spending billions of dollars and decades trying to overthrow the government, and then stopping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah they never stop. It&#39;s beyond money. it&#39;s power and control. Control. As individuals these people cannot stand not being in complete control. And Trump is likely a rogue sociopath. The fact that he is being attacked by all of them speaks to that. but no human can defeat the power that is pre-existantly evil. The evil they all fall in line with. He just can&#39;t stop until he faces that evil and that evil crushes him. It&#39;s like a hitman thinking he&#39;s going to kill the Don. He works his way through the ranks. Ever emboldening himself as he goes. Both the Don and the hitman are evil. But the Don is the Don because he is more evil and more willing and more capable than the hitman. The hitman doesn&#39;t figure that out until he&#39;s gasping for air with a bullet in his heart. A bullet shot through the Don&#39;s two main men. The boss of this world will ignite world war III to stay the boss. Is Trump willing to turn the entire planet into a Nuclear wasteland? The boss of this world is. 100%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is so monumentally bad that any alternative seems a good option. </p>

<p>Out of the two, I hated the idea of Clinton as she is clearly a crooked criminal and I felt that (although I am leftist) Trump would be a better option than Clinton. There is no way would I consider voting for him but in November I would have preferred Trump over Clinton. I was wrong. Really wrong. </p>

<p>I had delusions that maybe he would support the working class, pursue Hillary charges etc. But he focussed on destroying the planet with regressive climate policy, supports Israel, banned people from certain islamic countries and tried to dismantle Obamacare. </p>

<p>I was very wrong. Clinton would have been a better president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying, and you should also realise Trump has been in office for just 70 days. In my opinion he has bigger fish to fry right off the bat. Like the international human trafficking problems. There have already been 3000+ human trafficking arrests in the US in the 70 days he&#39;s been in office. Staggering numbers when compared to trafficking arrests in the 8 years of Obama&#39;s presidency.</p>

<p>Also the climate policies he has instated were to fight against the climate taxes average citizens would be paying, that goes right back into the pockets of the people who pushed climate protection policies.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/P4sqM">as this graph shows</a>, there were about 1800 trafficking arrests according to ICE &amp; Homeland Security.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna need a source that isn&#39;t a fake news website on the &quot;3000+ traffickers arrested in the last 70 days&quot; thing. Oh, and to arrange the goalposts a bit, it&#39;s gonna have to be from a reliable source, k? No russian disinfo, thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have used a graph that is outdated. Hundreds of trafficking arrests are happening everyday in the US. If you&#39;d like ANY other source confirming arrests in California, simply look up any of the thousands of articles in the past months. I am stating there have been over 3000 arrests this term because a verifiable NAVY seal, who just declared yesterday is fighting back against pedos. I&#39;m on mobile right now eating dinner so I don&#39;t have time to find the link but his name is Craig Sawyer. Conduct as much research as you&#39;d like. And I dont know what you&#39;re saying, that graph clearly shows around 400 arrests in 2014.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have the best response to this question so far. Or at least the one I can most relate to. </p>

<p>I 100% understand what OP is saying. And I don&#39;t really disagree. But I also think subject is much more nuanced than the way OP presents it. </p>

<p>There are plenty of things like you mentioned that really disappointed me about Obama. But after being an adult for sometime, when in any part of life is it not like that? </p>

<p>In my eyes, Obama was king of understanding that in order to get some good things done, you had to lose some of the other battles as well. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever have a president that doesn&#39;t do things that are questionable or disappointing. </p>

<p>Ultimately we have to look at what is a president doing to help the people who need it most. And I believe overall, Obama generally enacted policies that helped those people. So because of that I give him a thumbs up.</p>

<p>Trump on the other hand. His campaign is full of empty promises of making America great again. Bringing back manufacturing. Equalizing trade deals. Better healthcare, etc. which if the healthcare debacle is any indication then I feel confident stating that none his promises will come true. And will most likely not be helping the people who generally need it the most. </p>

<p>So Trump gets a thumbs down in my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your points. But you realize that just because you found some similarities, doesn&#39;t mean there are no differences.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Both Cats and Dogs have eyes</p></li>
<li><p>Both Cats and Dogs have a nose</p></li>
<li><p>Both Cats and Dogs are furry</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can you claim that cats are the same as dogs? Of course not. Pointing similarities doesn&#39;t nothing be demoralized people. </p>

<p>There are good politicians. 
* Bernie Sanders wants to end prohibition
* Bernie Sanders wants  audit the Federal Reserve
* Bernie Sanders wants to end illegal wiretapping
* Bernie Sanders blames the banks</p>

<p>See how that works. I&#39;m not saying Bernie is perfect. But throwing your hand up with the the false equivalency argument does no one any good. </p>

<p>Instead we need to find the Good candidates from the left and the Right. If all Republicans were fiscally conservative, socially liberal like Bill Well, I&#39;d vote (R) down ballot. But their not. So we need to stay active and encourage others to hep fix the broken system.</p>

It was the only way forward with the current political landscape and many believed that with continued Democrat support the bill could be improved over time. Congress moved more conservative because of the bill and the opportunity now is lost. So, here we are with an originally Republican plan and no Republicans willing to improve upon it, but rather revert because of &quot;socialism.&quot; This while they had years to create a better way forward rather than burn things down.</p>

<p>The gaslighting is so effective at this point that many original people in this sub don&#39;t speak out about it, or aren&#39;t even aware that the true shills are T_D shills and this has been proven by the numbers.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert, however I think the hysteria has gotten to you a bit on the privacy bill.</p>

<p>It was less than 30 words in length, and merely undid an EO Obama signed in the final month of his term.</p>

<p>So it set things back to the way they always were. I guess if democrats/Obama cared so much about privacy for consumers, they would have did this years ago.</p>

<p>Instead it&#39;s almost like Obama did this as he was leaving just to setup Trump and the Republicans so they could paint them like this when they repealed it.</p>

<p>What we are seeing now seems to be a lot of crocodile tears, politics, and grand standing to try to wedge their way back in with the middle class who left them.</p>

<p>If Congress did their jobs and served the American people&#39;s interests like OP demands, there&#39;d be bills to allow us to opt out of such privacy violations, including the CIAs backdoor into all of our tech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm.  I have three issues with that.</p>

<p>First, between the person who accepted the result of the election and the one who adamantly said he would refuse to accept anything but a win (and then refused to accept the results <em>anyway</em> claiming he has <em>also</em> won the popular vote), I don&#39;t feel as though Clinton&#39;s entitlement compares negatively to the populist.  Nor do I think she&#39;s any less of a cunt than him, though that&#39;s more personal opinion.</p>

<p>Second,  President Billionaire and the Goldman Sachs cabinet (with guest star Rexxon Mobile Tillerson) are arguably the most &quot;corporatist&quot; administration we&#39;ve ever had.</p>

<p>Third, that&#39;s a decision made by the voters, not Trump, Hillary, or Congress.  (mind, the allegations of elections fraud in the primary certainly seem plausible).   I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to include actions unrelated to legislation, because the contrast isn&#39;t clear enough (too murky)</p>

<p>That third one&#39;s important, because I still don&#39;t have the critical piece of evidence I need to reconsider my opinion.</p>

<p>What has Hillary done that puts her beneath the Republicans?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point he&#39;s making without outright saying it is that this was widely considered a political move to make trump look bad. Obama and the government knew this shit would get repealed, that&#39;s why they did it. It&#39;s not that they actually wanted it and the republicans didn&#39;t. None of them wanted it.</p>

<p>This is how they trick you into picking sides. You have the republican side that they often make to look like the stubborn, ignorant, corrupt old dudes that have too much power. Then you have the democrat side who is made to look like the good guys always voting for nice things but they just somehow never have the power to accomplish it (except when they have the power they still never accomplish anything and when it&#39;s required they still pass the evil shit).</p>

<p>It&#39;s an illusion. They&#39;re all on the same side; even the ones that don&#39;t realize it. Both sides are shit. The few genuine good people on both sides are just used for face and to waste the energy of people willing to work to change things while the rest of us just sit around and whine how bad the dems or reps are.</p>

<p>This is why democrats barely put any work or funding into down ballot. They just want the face of the country to appear like a good person so we all feel comfortable. They don&#39;t care to fight for majority control so that their votes actually matter because they don&#39;t WANT their votes to actually matter. They want the same things as the republicans while appearing to vote against those interests because their votes don&#39;t actually matter. </p>

<p>Why did the republicans repeal it?  Would the democrats have done that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little more complex to say whether the democrats would have repealed it or not. They have to balance risk vs reward of keeping up appearance while still fighting for the interests they secretly want. Most likely they would just do what they always do--coordinate with the republicans to vote just as much as needed and have the republicans do most of the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>You are missing the point if you think you can vote for one side that gives you a better set of rights and privileges. The whole point is that it is meaningless who you vote for, the outcome is the same. It just appears that one side is better but in reality this is not the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Giving an example that is explained within my own point isn&#39;t an example...</p>

<p>Like I said, nothing has been different with sides reversed. Obama was owned by citibank and had everything he needed to make change and they did nothing until they lost that power. Bill Clinton repealed glass steagall and fucked up the economy. Biden effectively wrote the patriot act. The war on drugs under obama, libya, syria, etc and so on. There are too many examples.</p>

<p>To illustrate this it would actually be better to point out what the democrats have actually accomplished for the big things that matter. In that regard it is very difficult to come up with anything to point to and show that they aren&#39;t the same as republicans. I honestly can&#39;t think of anything that fits a true, big, thing they did against corporate interests...the same as republicans.</p>

<p>The democrats only really succeed in changing things that don&#39;t matter to them. For example some civil issues like gay marriage etc, those are arguably better under democrats. If that&#39;s enough for you then I don&#39;t blame you for voting since it doesn&#39;t matter otherwise. But keep in mind they only use these things politically and don&#39;t actually care. They care about money and power, not about gay people. The same is true with republicans, they just take the other side but don&#39;t usually truly care. </p>

<p>...Within a system that does not allow an outcome to differ depending on this action that was evidenced. If I am pointing out that the idea of voting records is being used to make one side appear better when in reality it isn&#39;t allowed to make any difference and due to this both sides are the same, it can not be used as evidence to show that one side is better.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t address what I said. Provide an example where the democrats had the power to make big change that wasn&#39;t a social issue that is against the interests of the elites that the republicans opposed and they succeeded.</p>

This bill didn&#39;t even go into effect until January, I think and parts of it have yet to even go into effect. Rolling back this bureaucratic expansion will not take away your privacy protection as all these concerns were already covered by existing FCC FTC rules.

<p>This is a patently false. This is what the lying corporate lobbyists are saying on TV. Even the Breitbart does not go that far to make that claim. The reality is with this bill, our privacy protections go from OP-IN, or privacy by default to OP-OUT, or privacy only if you request it. </p>

I go to original surces like <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-16-148A1.pdf">the bill itself</a> I review it and listen to both sides with an open mind.</p>

<p>In this case, one side is clearly using word games, fallacious arguments, and downright lies to promise that cause. I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;ve been tricked by ISP corporate lobbyists. You&#39;ve done nothing be regurgitate their talking points. </p>

<p>At least you admit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The opt in/opt out part is true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which if you understand what it mean, is the basis of my argument, that <strong>this bill erodes our privacy rights.</strong> </p>

<p>Please explain to me how our privacy rights going from OP-IN to OP-OUT is NOT a loss of privacy for Americans? I&#39;m glad you at least understand the effect of the law change. I just don&#39;t see how you can come to such a different conclusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is always a bigger picture.</p>

<p>So you are willing to trade some liberty, by expanding a bureaucracy for the future regulating/censoring of the internet, in exchange for an initial false sense of security?</p>

<p>I say false sense of security because this bill continues to allow the same thing &quot;targetted advertising&quot; to be done by every website including google and social media.</p>

<p>This rule along with net neutrality will set up the initial frame work needed for the FCC to be the thought police of the internet, in the future, gradually, one increment at a time. Every pyramid needs a sturdy foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think running a large company that has done very well gives him great leadership skills but this is just my opinion. 
You also said trump intends to sign a policy and unfortunately until he does it&#39;s just words and opinions. 
If your speaking about healthcare when you stated he can&#39;t pass a bill his campaign ran on I would ask you who who put this policy in place to bitch about? I don&#39;t expect him to know all the ins and outs of healthcare and that&#39;s why he asked everyone to try to come together and figure it out but how is that possible with a huge divide over Russia when the American people are the ones suffering. Our congress and senate don&#39;t live under Obamacare so they don&#39;t give 2 shits about the people. He has started to bring back jobs. He&#39;s trying to put in place extreme vetting to protect our country but he&#39;s blocked by divide every chance he gets. 
The 3 letter agency&#39;s you speak of are already crooked as hell and the left blocks to the point he can&#39;t fill his cabinet which is unheard of. So much for a smooth transition. 
Hillary had way more problems than her legal policies. Oil, drugs, human trafficking, pay to play and toppling other countries governments while laughing about it was pretty sick and saying well she didn&#39;t win is not an excuse for her to not be prosecuted. So because you don&#39;t win, blame FBI, blame fake news, blame Russia and act like children its ok? That&#39;s BS!
He did state he would put his tax returns out once he&#39;s done being audited so thank the IRS and I do agree he should. 
His company he gave to his kids and he&#39;s taking no government pay except $1 because he had to. 
He owns the place he supposedly vacations at so if he wasn&#39;t required to take air force one and his life wasn&#39;t threatened by people and him needing more security there isn&#39;t much to bitch about when we paid for every aspect of obamas vacations. I can&#39;t speak to the fees being upped as I&#39;m not a member are you? I could see it&#39;s easier to protect him if they deter more people if that&#39;s the case but again I&#39;m not a member so I don&#39;t know if this is true. If people would stop threatening him and his family we would have a lot less to bitch about. When I see people bitch about how much his security is it&#39;s comical because it&#39;s their own fault for threatening his life to be honest. Also the SS renting his golf carts. That just sounds so stupid. Do we have proof of this?</p>

<p>I&#39;m only giving an opposite opinion of your view. The guy is trying to be taken down from every angle at this point so he must be doing something. Sorry it&#39;s so long but Russia made me write this ; )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leadership skills:</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re confusing a &quot;strict boss&quot; with a &quot;strong leader&quot;.</p>

<p>There are a lot of little examples I can press on, but healthcare reform is <strong>the</strong> issue that demonstrates what I consider to be complete lack of leadership skills on the part of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Republicans have a super-majority right now.  They can pass any law they want, and they don&#39;t need an executive to &quot;lead&quot; the democrats (which, let me remind you represent half the country) at all.  </p>

<p>Just about every republican in congress campaigned on getting rid of Obamacare.  &quot;Repeal and Replace&quot; was the party platform.  <em>Everybody</em> was pushing it.</p>

<p>Now Republicans couldn&#39;t pass the healthcare bill, and Trump gave up.  He couldn&#39;t organize his own political party to pass a law that <em>every single one of them</em> had campaigned on for the better part of a decade.  Not only that, he couldn&#39;t pull a <em>single vote</em> from the democrats.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t strike me as leadership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there are dirty democrats and republicans that&#39;s why it&#39;s better to be more in the middle. Your upset at Trump over Obamacare when Hillary and Obama put it in place and again congress and senate don&#39;t have Obamacare so they don&#39;t give 2 shits unfortunately. Obama even waited till right after his second election to put it into place. Wasn&#39;t that so sweet. What can Trump do about it exactly is my question to you I guess? It has to be written up and voted on and truthfully he&#39;s attacked by all sides over stupid stuff instead of everyone saying let&#39;s help him fix this for the people. Instead we are fighting over Russia. He has tried executive order on the extreme vetting and he was fraught at every angle. Congress is responsible for Obamacare we elect them to represent the people and they couldn&#39;t get it done. Go figure. I don&#39;t think Trump is done with Obamacare but we have to hold congress responsible and that means both sides. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure if Trump was a truly horrible boss he would&#39;ve had millions of disgruntled employees way before the election and I&#39;ve never worked for him or met him so I can knock him as this Strict Boss however I&#39;m sure no boss that just let their employees do nothing didn&#39;t make millions and became president of the US. You have to give that to him. </p>

<p>I do thank you for having a decent conversation. I think we should all take like this. Like we used to with supposing views. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to buy into the &quot;Both sides are the same bit&quot;.  It started in the late 90&#39;s, when I read that Michael Moore book &quot;Downsize this&quot;.  The term he used was &quot;republicrats&quot;.</p>

<p>But there are legislative differences between the two.  Sure, they both support the same organizations, but they don&#39;t support the same human rights.  They&#39;re not catering to the same voters.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, Republicans are holding the religious right hostage with their opposition to abortion, and using their political weight to prevent a third party from appealing to conservative principles that don&#39;t relate to religion.  They have absolutely no necessity to act on policy.</p>

<p>On the left, the democrats are still nominally adherent to policy choices, taxes, human rights, climate change, and so on.  The bill in question is an example where all the republicans pointed the most evil direction, and none of the democrats did.</p>

<p>If both sides are the same, there should be an example of a flip-flop on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hold the position OP seems to that it doesn&#39;t matter <em>at all</em> who&#39;s elected, but I do think both sides are ultimately being used to the same ends, even if they get there differently. </p>

<p>Whichever side is elected, there are winners and losers. Dems are <em>generally</em> better for the poor and lower-middle class, Republicans for the upper-middle and upper-class. On the whole, I prefer the Democratic stance on social issues. </p>

<p>Yet I think the best way to explain my belief that both sides contribute to the same negative outcomes is what Democratic presidents have done against their base&#39;s interests in the last 20 years, and why I think they&#39;ve done it. </p>

<p>One case of note is Obama&#39;s handling of national security and surveillance. The public, particularly the left, was weary of war and angry about PATRIOT and other measures by 2008. Obama was elected in part as a response to this. But once in office, he continued and presided over the expansion of many of these surveillance and national security measures, including the NDAA (forget the year) which allowed US citizens to be indefinitely detained without due process, and the codification of the NSA domestic spying practices revealed by Snowden, which had previously been occurring but not acknowledged by the government. </p>

<p>Sure, McCain or Romney would have done these same things, but they would have received much greater pushback from the left, who were largely silent or became so quickly after these things came out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that Democrats are inherently as bad on national security or surveillance, but they play a role in normalizing these things, and acting as the pressure release valve for discontent of the policies. Surveillance became <em>worse</em> under Obama than it was under Bush, yet the public outcry is lesser. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you live in the world today, and I&#39;m speaking from the perspective of living in the west, it&#39;s easy to fall victim to lies. Naturally, our lives have been made to be stressful, as all of life is a learning lesson. Yet, they&#39;ve been made outrageously stressful. I read yesterday that 70% of millionaires admit that they do not feel wealthy. Now, imagine a family of 5, middle-class income. Imagine the stress almost everyone feels. </p>

<p>And when your life is so overwhelmed with stress, with what to do next, with a structured day, with endless responsibilities, with incessant thinking, with never knowing who or what you really are...you tend to never have the time to contemplate what the hell is actually going on in reality. You never really ask what ALL of this living thing is really about. </p>

<p>Thus, because we never take the time to question what&#39;s true and real, we fall victim to listening to others. Beyond that, we&#39;re born into lives of structure where we&#39;re spoon fed from the &#39;system&#39; and become reliant upon finding out information from people who come before us. I attended an elite college in the US and, even there, rarely were we trained in critical thought. More so, we focused on being better than our peers at whatever it was we were doing because it meant getting a better job.</p>

<p>A year out of college, I crashed mentally when I took a second to contemplate reality and what I was. That lead to realizing that, for 25 years I&#39;d lived a life of closed-mindedness. I realized that everything I thought I knew was, in fact, not true because thoughts hold no basis in reality. </p>

<p>Anyway, just saying it&#39;s easy to see how people can believe that Hillary or Obama are just a couple of bros who had good intentions. People are so lost in their own individual &#39;games of life&#39; that they can&#39;t exist with an open-mind. Their lives are fundamentally chaotic, thus their mental clarity isn&#39;t able to find a state in which truth becomes blatantly apparent. I mean, look around and witness the state of the world and how horrid it is. The fact that people are unwilling to acknowledge the truth is insane, literally. And because people exist within an insane state of consciousness -- in that they are so egoic, so about the self, so lost in the game -- we are having trouble coming together as One. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said.</p>

<p>And something that is apparent in the anti Homeschool thread on r/all today.  We are indoctrinated by the system. Not just public school but all school and life too.  We are taught anyone doing something without a government approved certification or rubber stamp is a fraud and a lair and dangerous.  We are taught to never question authority. To conform and bully each other foe being different.  We are taught any ideas outside the approved narrative, and especially by unstamped unofficial authorities is automatically wrong and inherently dangerous.</p>

<p>We are cut off by design from independence and self reliance.  Food must be purchased through government approved stores, made in government approved kitchens or factories and labeled per government approved regulations.  We must onky seek health assistance from AMA certified and government approved doctors and the nurses and PAs can only be trusted when supervised.  </p>

<p>All &quot;medicine&quot; must be big pharma produced and government approved.  Taking herbs is frowned upon and smear campaigns and disinformation on that and homeopathy and chiropractic treatment is all frauds and just out to steal from you. Yet some 450,000 people a year are hospitalized by correctly prescribed and government approved pharmaceuticals.  Homeopathy hasn&#39;t killed anyone but there is a new push on UK to ban it.</p>

<p>Today i watched a bunch if ignorant jerks talk shit about homeschooling and the parents that choose to do it and the organizations set up to help and protect them.</p>

<p>A few actually knew or had been homeschooled and corrected some of the worst comments.  But the jerk who turned a &quot;how to protect yourself from over zealous CPS harassing you for homeschooling&quot; into a &quot;how to abuse your kids and get away with it&quot; describing the link.</p>

<p>My post on that huff post article about 80% + kids saved by the FBI were foster kids was not well received last I checked.  And honestly the number of homeschool kids abused by parents can&#39;t even remotely compare.  That and the kids aren&#39;t kept in bunkers or cult compounds. We still participate in sports and scouts and clubs.  In fact the homeschool weekly meet up groups are more likely to spot a child being abused than public school teachers with 30+ kids to corral.</p>

<p>But oh yeah all homeschools keep their kids locked in the basement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with your comment on this subject. I attended public school, but my parents made sure that I was also educated outside of that as well, and I made sure my sibs were too. Our close cousin is homeschooled. If my parents had the resources we would have been as well.</p>

<p>I think the indoctrination of our school-age children is absolutely abhorrent, and <em>actual</em> education takes a back-seat to this &quot;government training,&quot; and manipulating kids to participate in sports-related activities so that they are too tired and distracted to want to <em>learn.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s sad because as humans, studies show that in our formative years we learn the most and are capable of absorbing so much knowledge in a very short amount of time. There is some truth to the saying that &quot;you can&#39;t teach old dogs new tricks.&quot; Education is the key to life and we rob our kids of that every day.</p>

<p>we fall victim to listening to others. Beyond that, we&#39;re born into lives of structure where we&#39;re spoon fed from the &#39;system&#39; and become reliant upon finding out information from people who come before us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The muslim world is experiencing a similar thing. Arab elitists are preying on their stressed population, influencing them to cause violence and be hateful. The young jihadist blowing himself up in Iraq is <em>mentally and psychologically</em> no different than the muslim-hating youtube commentor in the west. They both want to eradicate their enemies, and they are both pawns in the game- being moved around the chess board by their masters. </p>

<p>Im going to get a ton of downvotes for saying this but whatever. Islam is a small, small factor in whats going on in the middle east <em>compared to the decades of war with Israel and the west</em>. They have been at war their entire lives, their father&#39;s entire life, and their grandfather&#39;s life. Look at that quote again, &quot;we&#39;re born into lives of structure where we&#39;re spoon fed from the &#39;system&#39; and become reliant upon finding out information from people who come before us.&quot; The religion (and sense of religious nationalism) just provides a convenient vessel for the elites to channel that hatred. </p>

<p>Heres the kicker, we are seeing the same thing going on online in discussions about islamic terrorism. European nationalists who want to use violence in the name of god and country. The &quot;violence&quot; is obviously degrees smaller than their muslim counterparts, but if this war continues for a few more generations and becomes entrenched in western culture the say way it has in the muslim world, then those twitter fingers will turn into trigger fingers. </p>

<p>This is some serious world war 3, apocalypse stuff if we dont find a solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely. And don&#39;t ever let a concern for receiving downvotes hold you back from speaking from the heart, although I&#39;m sure you are already aware.</p>

<p>What frightens me is that it&#39;s becoming intensely clear that the majority will not awaken until significant stress/confusion/sadness takes over their lives. Often times, it takes deep darkness entering one&#39;s mind in order for one to remember the light. </p>

<p>My intention lies in an apocalypse not happening. But my intuition suggests that massive suffering will ensue because that&#39;s what the collective has decided it will need in order to see what&#39;s true again.  I only feel this way because I woke up after severe depression, which came as a result of huge internal conflicts stemming from the ego I&#39;d developed and an inability to really understand this foreign-feeling world. I hope I&#39;m wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And i feel like mental illness is becoming way more common, especially among younger generations. I also have depression and a lot of my friends have some shit wrong with their head. Its almost as if our collective ego is having some sort of internal conflict, as if this fake world we have created is blocking us from what it truly feels like to be human... I mean shit, how many 40 year olds have to take xanax or drink themselves to sleep because they are stuck in some lifeless, corporate job just to feed their kids?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, man. I think about how prevalent mental illness seems, all the time. </p>

<p>My theory is that our thinking has increased in its rate -- a consequence of introducing tech to the masses, like cell phones and texting, which we&#39;ve become heavily attached to -- and we worry more than ever -- the increased threat of &#39;wars on terror&#39; that our young generations deal with more and more and the general induction of perpetual anxiety via believing we exist in a threatened environment -- and with capitalism working in a sort of see-saw fashion, all the money has ended up in the pockets of some while not others, leaving the world a harder place to find work opportunities for younger job-seeking peoples. All these things -- oh and including the fact that, over time, we learn more and thus have to be taught more than generations prior in order to &#39;advance&#39; -- are parts of a daily thought-cycle for the standard person. To be fair, I am only 26, not married, and have no children.</p>

<p>Beyond all of that, the craziest aspect of humanity is that the majority believes its own being is its own thoughts. People are unable to separate what they really are (consciousness) from their thoughts (which blatantly appear within consciousness, not as consciousness). So, over time, a society that teaches the wrong way of thinking (memory, analytics) and creates too much noise in its collective head, and a society in which all its people believe they are their own, individual thoughts, it then makes sense to me to look around and see an anxiety-ridden, atheistic, poor, confused world dominated by its military but even more sadly dominated by its own thought structure. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m high.</p>

<p>I know blacks and mexicans that voted for him. Despite public opinion, there are legal 1st gen mexicans and 2nd+ generation mexicans that actually don&#39;t care if we have strict control over immigration - they might even full well support it. There are blacks that are not convinced he&#39;s racist simply because he wants more control over the border. There are plenty of people that don&#39;t think he&#39;s a rapist because he made some extremely lewd comments.</p>

<p>So many fucking ad hominem attacks on people this election. That&#39;s what pissed me off the most. I don&#39;t like Trump whatsoever but I fully support others&#39; rights to vote for who they want even if it&#39;s not my preferred candidate. This is a fucking democracy. They have a right to put their word in and vote for the leader of their choice. I don&#39;t have to respect their decision but I damn well support their right to make it and I&#39;m not going to use it as an attack against their character.</p>

<p>We only have two real choices, and I have to believe that people have a good reason to vote for one or the other. Otherwise, we&#39;re just setting up an elective dictatorship and counting on the &quot;good&quot; choice being made. I can&#39;t hate people for making a decision in representation that I didn&#39;t make. If there&#39;s no choice, then the people don&#39;t have true representation, and democracy failed. That scares me much, much more than my candidate losing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m really hoping we&#39;re seeing the end of a fascist regime. Coincidentally, I had my own reaction, too, knowing these elites follow satanic rituals; -- it&#39;s reconnected me with Christianity.</p>

<p>Liberal atheist to conservative Christian. Trump is president, <em>and I voted for him.</em> Have to say: life is pretty unpredictable. Really didn&#39;t see any of this coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not any of how I feel is real, I <em>feel</em> like it&#39;s given my life purpose, so I haven&#39;t felt as depressed in life. </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s kinda helping me lead a more healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>Anyways, logically, you can&#39;t prove a negative, i.e. you can&#39;t <em>prove</em> there <em>isn&#39;t</em> a God, so you may as well just invite the possibility that a God can exist. There&#39;s a history of religious belief, and it&#39;s sorta interesting how atheism spawned from some rich people trying to kill the spirit of the world.</p>

<p>God bless!</p>

<p>He said Ron Paul could never win so we have to go with the lesser evil.  I said everyone says that but think about all the people you know voting for the lesser evil and what if we all refused and voted for someone outside the the two evils.  That we are all conditioned to believe we throw our votes away going independent or 3rd party or classic Republican or classic liberal.  Truth is if we all ignored that we would effect change.</p>

<p>Then we all are. Is that your point? There is <em>a lot</em> wrong with US (worldwide) politics just as there is <em>a lot</em> wrong with our social system but in the end democracy comes down to a common course where the <em>best</em> route is pretty much clear (or so it would seem as in e.g. climate change, human rights, etc..) and <em>compromise</em> in all other aspects.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s get to your argument that <em>the whole government is corrupt beyond measure</em>: By which metric? Yeah, US politicians depend far more on donations than it is reasonable and lobbyism grew to be a cancer in decision making but if we take a look at the stances  the Tea party took: Well, some people really believe in cutting social securities as a easure of personal freedom. </p>

News flash, its the present now. Our wyes are collectively opened. We will find these criminals which affected our national standings. They will pay for their crimes.</p>

I guarantee there are enough people in the world willing to push together to change this.  The Cabal knows it, so they try their hardest to keep us all in the dark.  </p>

<p>the way it looks to me, your characterizations don&#39;t represent the majority of people on the left. i believe the majority of them were were also very disappointed by obama&#39;s failings, and openly concerned by clinton&#39;s shadyness.</p>

<p>a lot of those people were concerned enough to in fact to support a different democrat candidate, and even more would shamefully admit after the fact there was manipulation by insiders of their party to ensure bernie didn&#39;t win the nomination.</p>

<p>but the point is that this, what i claim to be, majority of democrats supported their party and candidate in the election as the far lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s controversial to say that democratic politicians in the past decades have largely been corrupt and sinister in the traditional fashion, where as republicans have been off the reservation in their level of hypocracy and incredulity. looking at just the presidents:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you have an idiot who let his administration be taken over by his vp and capitulated in unprecedented deception leading to unnecessary war and the lives &amp; trillions it wasted. not to mention the incompetence (at best) to let the events happen that initiated all that. policies and appointments that led to environmental disasters and financial ruin</p></li>
<li><p>that man&#39;s senior, a spook from the old days who literally knew where the bodies were buried, and far deeper in the pockets of the saudi&#39;s than what the worst of the hillary citicisms could sink to. continued the expansion of the military industry complex amidst an overall reduction in global tension</p></li>
<li><p>this current horror show ... there&#39;s just too much to mention! it&#39;s ironic that it&#39;s the party of patriotism &amp; responsibility who nominated perhaps the least patriotic and irresponsible candidate in america&#39;s history</p></li>

<li><p>bill&#39;s run of the mill corporate favoritism, a few disasterous policies, though largely righting the economic and depravity of the previous decade</p></li>
<li><p>a man who didn&#39;t live up to the promises and expectations of an actual liberal, who turned out to be another centrist. vast competent compared to the jokers who bookended him, his largest criticisms are that he continued or expanded some policies of the previous administration: foreign policy, surveillance. economic recovery during unprecedented &amp; hypocritical inaction by his opposition</p></li>
</ul>

<p>in the hindsight of a mere dozen weeks, was it not clear to everyone that your nation would have been vastly better served by electing the other candidate? that there was a chance of working to pressure and oppose the bad while enjoying the good of another competent administration? is it not clear to everyone that in comparison, we&#39;re witnessing an utter disaster whose only bright side is that impeachment, on many counts, is a near certainty before he makes his first SOTU address.</p>

<p>funny how preceding the most recent impeachment row in the late 90s, years and millions were spent investigating, turning over every stone, and the most damning case the investigators could find was that bill was a rather a horndog. whereas a couple months into 45&#39;s term, the treason and corruption are blatant.</p>

<p>Having lived in countries with actual impactful corruption, I can say without reservation: bullshit.  Human are inherently &quot;corrupt&quot; and that will never change. <em>You are no different</em>, yet America has rewarded you far beyond what you deserve, despite the inevitable corruption.  </p>

<p>Besides, you are in r/conspiracy.  This place might as well be run directly by Moscow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t that simple.</p>

<p>It is based on a little hope. Yeah there are similarities, but there were definitely huge differences that indicate, for the first time I know of in my life, a possible outsider canddidate.</p>

<p>Yes its possible he is just establishment being used to divide people, but we only have our conjecture for that. We just keep that in mind and for now follow the evidence and that points at him not being establishment.</p>

<p>Sure he is still corrupt corporate shill, but the mideast and global agenda doesnt seem as strong if there at all. </p>

<p>You can call people that go all in sheep if you want, but to me you dont look any different because there is undeniable information that points to a difference between this candidate and the establishment. He still might be, and uf he isnt he no doubt woyld build his own, hut there is still plenty that points to him not being. </p>

<p>Open your mind. Don&#39;t get so caught up in dismissing beliefs because then you can rapid fire dismiss a belief without looking at all angles of what created it.</p>

<p>Right now there is a pull away from the establishments stated and obvios number one priority of removing Assad. </p>

<p>Also, and everyone should consider this, there WAS a friendly disposition between Trump and Russia, but the esyablishment keeps harping on this story with no evidence. Why? Well we know they have desire to fight russia because it is inevitable to achieve all middle east goals. So how do you keep ties strained and keep a friendly relationship from developing? Make the leader afraid to involve himself with anything Russian for fear of looking a way that might give credibility to the lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been awoke for a while, but I&#39;ve been in the military for a few years longer. I&#39;m coming up on 11 and I should have a few more years, I&#39;m done lying to myself and to others about the cause I&#39;m doing. I was going to try and do the whole 20 years, but I&#39;m a submariner and I&#39;m fucking spent man. I&#39;m going to med board for injurys I&#39;ve sustained over the years and I&#39;m pursuing to get out. I&#39;m sick and tired of everything that the government has become and I&#39;m sick and tired of just bitching about it, so I&#39;m going to go back to school and do my god damndest to get into politics and try and make a change myself. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll be able to do, but I&#39;m done talking and I&#39;m going to try and stop it. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really know what I would do with my life, and I was always so upset and bitter about the things I saw and listening to the idiots around me rationalize this shit, and just living and breathing hate and feeling so lost when I thought about my future but when I thought some more the only light at the end of the tunnel was seeing the bullshit all around us, and deciding I need to do something to try and change it.</p>

<p>From &#39;ole Teddy Roosevelt &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post, just wanted to share my thoughts. Thanks.</p>

I bitch and whine about it all the time, and I&#39;m sick and tired of just doing it.

<p>I&#39;ve been active duty for the last 11 years, but would consider myself aware for the last few. I&#39;m looking at a medical separation coming up within the next few months and see it as a fresh start to try and make some good. I have grown more and more bitter over the years dealing with the same crap and just becoming more cold and hateful of everything because of it. My wife and I talked we discussed things and she helped me to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>She has gotten sick of my bullshit because of it and told me to stop just whining about it and go do something about it if I&#39;m really so angry about everything. That&#39;s it, this is my chance other than just talking to friends and family about things to try and actually make a change. I&#39;ve decided to go back to school and get into politics and try and truly do my part to make some change.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll be able to do, but I&#39;m going to try my absolute hardest to do everything I can to show people it doesn&#39;t have to be the way it has been for so long. The more of us that try to actually do something can maybe increase the chances to see it do any have to be like that.</p>

<p>From Theodore Roosevelt &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry it was a long post, I&#39;m just so sick and god damn tired of everything, and I really want to try everything I can to show everyone it doesn&#39;t have to be like this. We don&#39;t need to be working for these people, they needed to be reminded they work for us. Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an Australian so I look on at the U.S. political game with cynicism for both sides. But what I just want to mention and ask you all is: do you feel capitalism is the right answer? I mean I&#39;m not a socialist/libtard/cuck/whatever the fck else stupid adjective social media slaves want to use, but the question must be asked. </p>

<p>The U.S. isn&#39;t just another capitalist democracy, it is THE capitalist democracy which built on the founding economic theory of Netherlands and other capitalist countries. And I personally believe capitalism is needed, some free-market forces are required in order to encourage innovation and economic growth. However, I believe the neoliberal experiment (Reagonomics) which has shaped the world in the last 30 years has failed and is the major contributor to much of the problems you (OP) describe. 
Although neoliberalism touted small government, it was a tool used by the U.S. (building on the foundations after WW2 when they started the architecture with the founding of the U.N.) to force smaller global economies into globalism - If you aren&#39;t aligned with the IMF, WHO, etc and are a moderately sized economy like Australia, SEAsia countries or European countries, what happens to your economy if you don&#39;t align with the global monetary standard? So the U.S. was able to force much of the world, and especially western world, into neoliberalism and the globalist structure and we have all chased this neoliberal (ultra-capitalism) ideal where political parties don&#39;t matter because multinational corporations have the lobbying and economic power to force their weight across multiple global economies. </p>

<p>The tldr: the neoliberal experiment was able to reduce government size whilst creating the latest gap accelerating at a rate quicker than ever seen in history between the gap between the 1% and the rest of us. </p>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;m not a socialist but ultra capitalism (neoliberalism and I even think some U.S. media calls it crony capitalism now) has made politics obsolete. Lobbying is the true power and I believe every scandal, secret, even military operation is orchestrated by the money aka the elite. </p>

<p>Furthermore, has anyone actually read Das Kapital? I know everyone just rolls their eyes and doesn&#39;t bother, but Marx actually argued that capitalism was a stage of socioeconomic development, not an end game. His endgame was socialism. When we all look at how shit the world is now and how large the gap between rich and poor is and continues to grow, you can&#39;t help but wonder if our preconditioned way of thinking (socialists bad, capitalism good) is part of the indoctrination. </p>

<p>Lastly, we work to obtain wealth to pass on when we die. Otherwise what&#39;s the point? This is a uniquely European concept. Indigenous cultures across the globe, before European contact, built great cities and had complex social structures, without the need for acquiring mass wealth. There is something about that which makes me feel I&#39;ve swallowed the blue pill and am a robot.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: first big post, don&#39;t rape hard. Also, all this is theory, I&#39;m a soldier in the Aussie Army and am not a hippie/red/libtard/socialist/safe space/etc etc. I just wonder why few have it all and billions have none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canadian, so you can consider my point moot if necessary, but i pay attention to this shit because people I love live there and their well-being matters to me.  Trump&#39;s a total fuck obviously,  that racist pos grandpa you wish would just die instead of telling you to get married right quick before pinching your bum. Mostly harmless, if only he hadn&#39;t scraped the rest of the scum off the underside of Washington and put them in the Whitehouse. His attempts at legislation aren&#39;t what affects me in the great white north but his filthy rhetoric is already inspiring racist and misogynistic sentiment here in Toronto. Trump is whatever but his getting elected empowers the Betsy&#39;s and Mike&#39;s and the Brietbarts to fulfill their archaic agendas, further the advancement of the wealthy, white, male-privileged, and maintain our enslavement to this Imperial capitalist machine. There&#39;s so much fucking garbage floating in the ether, I understand it&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s real or fake, but words fucking matter. Trump got elected because he used language that made the poor uneducated religious white people feel justified in their distrust of minorties, and &#39;nasty women&#39; (re: Hilary but also any woman who believes in intersectional feminism.)  The language that gets used in our daily lives all serves a purpose and seeks to connect us to ideas and knowledge or exclude and misinform us. The shit he&#39;s said over and over again,  the shit members of his cabinet BELIEVE tells me they haven&#39;t fucking evolved with the rest of us, and having those christian/religious ideologies be the basis of reform is extremely counterintuitive. Unfortunately we&#39;re so fucking entrenched in this reality that there is no hope of peaceful resolution. Since thats the case, my vote is group suicide, who&#39;s in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be extremely honest: I don&#39;t believe any of the conspiracy theories about Clinton or Trump.</p>

<p>Trump is no Russian spy, and Hillary Clinton is no pedophile/ISIS supporter/corrupt bankster, etc.</p>

<p>That being said, Hillary was demonized by the insane Right way too much. There are countless examples, but the best one is how people here thought Trump was good and Hillary <em>literally</em> wanted WWIII with Russia and wanted to bomb Syria, shooting down Russian planes.</p>

<p>This was splattered <em>ad nauseam</em> across the internet, especially here.</p>

<p>And yet, in this private speech of hers, she actually argues  <strong>against</strong> doing all that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the idea that we would have like a no fly zone — Syria, of course, did have when it started the fourth biggest Army in the world. It had very sophisticated air defense systems. They’re getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, <strong>many of which are located in populated areas.</strong> So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so <strong>we’re not putting our pilots at risk — you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians</strong>. So all of a sudden** this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. <strong>In Libya we didn’t have that problem. It’s a huge place. The air defenses were not that sophisticated and there wasn’t very — in fact, there were very few civilian casualties. That wouldn’t be the case. And then you add on to it a lot of the air defenses are not only in civilian population centers but near some of their chemical stockpiles. **You do not want a missile hitting a chemical stockpile.</strong> We have a big set of issues about what is going to happen with those storehouses of chemicals since a lot want their hands on them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, she&#39;s against establishing a NFZ in Syria, points out that it would endanger American pilots, take Syrian lives, and cause mass casualties. She even uses the word &quot;glibly&quot; to describe those who wanted a war in Syria! </p>

<p>Remember how she was supposedly in bed with the Saudis so they could &quot;fund ISIS&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s been complicated by the fact that the Saudis and others are shipping large amounts of weapons—and pretty indiscriminately—not at all targeted toward the people that we think would be the more moderate, least likely, to cause problems in the future, but this is another one of those very tough analytical problems.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If she were a Saudi puppet, why would she admit they were funnelling money to Jihadist groups?</p>

<p>Remember, these are her <em>private</em> speeches. This is who she truly is and what she thought.</p>

<p>A fine person, smeared as being a pedophile/corrupt person, etc. The story behind this is also simple:</p>

<p>I believe there was a large double standard appliesdtowards Hillary. </p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s approval ratings after she stepped down as SoS were the 2nd-highest for any leaving SoS (after Powell). Republicans at the time were publicly panicking that she&#39;d be &quot;impossible&quot; to defeat if she ran for POTUS again, presumably in 2016. Thus began the Benghazi and the emails sagas. Here&#39;s an article way back from <em>2013</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/12/republicans-fear-clinton-in-2016/">Republicans Fear Clinton in 2016</a></p>

<p>One early primary state RNC member put it simply: <strong>“If she gets in, we’re toast.”</strong></p>

<p>“We thought we could beat her [in 2008] because she was seen as bitter and unlikeable — and that’s what Obama proved,” said one Republican operative at the meeting. But Clinton finished her tenure as Secretary of State with stratospheric approval ratings, has added four years of Cabinet-level foreign policy making to her resume, and appears far less likely to face a strong 2016 primary challenge like the one Obama mounted in 2007 and 2008. <strong>“We’re hoping she doesn’t run, because if she does, she’ll win,” said the same operative.</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Overhearing discussions about Clinton in the hallway outside the RNC meeting, Jorge Landivar, a Ron Paul-backing delegate to the 2012 Republican convention from Texas, chimed in: <strong>“All the polls say she will destroy anyone that we put up — it’s [f—ng] terrifying.”</strong>  National polling from Quinnipiac University finds that Clinton, the most popular national political figure, would defeat  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie 45 – 37 percent; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio 50 – 34 percent and Rep. Paul Ryan 50 – 38 percent.</p>

<p>And one former Romney aide here warned that grassroots activists pushing for an even more conservative GOP identity could seal the party’s fate: <strong>“If we listen to some of the people here and come back with a hardline conservative in 2016, she’ll wipe the floor with us.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Might I remind you about what Kevin McCarthy said back in September of 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable right? But we put together a Benghazi Special Committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping,&quot;</strong> McCarthy said. &quot;Why? Cause she’s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought and made that happen,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <em>Vox</em> puts it the best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So somehow an investigation that once upon a time was about a terrorist attack on an American consulate becomes an inquiry into Freedom of Information Act compliance, which shifts into a question about handling of classified material. A probe of sexting by the husband of a woman who works for Clinton morphs into a quest for new emails, and if the emails turn out not to be new at all (which seems likely), it will morph into some new questions about Huma Abedin’s choice of which computers to use to check her email.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It’s the same drive that led to Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial on the grounds that he had perjured himself to try to cover up an affair that was uncovered in an investigation that was originally supposed to be looking into a years-old Arkansas land deal on which the Clintons had lost money. The Whitewater investigation did not reveal any crimes. So rather than wrap things up and consider the Clintons exonerated, the investigators went looking under other rocks and came up with Monica Lewinsky.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Want to know the name of the entity that sued the State Department to release Hillary&#39;s emails? <strong>Citizens United.</strong> Should sound familiar.</p>

<p>It really is Brave New World. Smears about spies, pedophillia, prostitutes, Jews, banksters, &quot;Globalists&quot;, Rostchilds, Zionists, etc. only distract from debate about the policy positions of political candidates.</p>

<p>Who benefits from this? The Republican party, the Conservative-entertainment-media complex that spreads conspiracy theories (ad revenue), and America&#39;s enemies.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, I&#39;m a Canadian. Most Americans don&#39;t bother with this stuff, which is sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t been in a long time to be honest. Floating around r/conspiracy everything is pretty tame. I mean.. right now the entire internet is team hillary vs team trump. It&#39;s all pretty engrossing. From my perspective we are at end game here. Financial collapse coinciding with Civil War and World War. It&#39;s going to be pointless and impossible in understanding who, what, why, how. Just have to survive if it&#39;s your destiny and accept that the lord of this world is the lord of this world because of it&#39;s willingness to commit evil and destruction no other sociopath is capable of. And still these peon sociopaths will try. Trump is a narcissist and looks capable and smart against the mid tier peon power structure. But as he pushes he will start to come face to face with who&#39;s really in control. And that power fully intends to turn this earth into a nuclear wasteland when the time comes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point he&#39;s making without outright saying it is that this was widely considered a political move to make trump look bad. Obama and the government knew this shit would get repealed, that&#39;s why they did it. It&#39;s not that they actually wanted it and the republicans didn&#39;t. None of them wanted it.</p>

<p>This is how they trick you into picking sides. You have the republican side that they often make to look like the stubborn, ignorant, corrupt old dudes that have too much power. Then you have the democrat side who is made to look like the good guys always voting for nice things but they just somehow never have the power to accomplish it (except when they have the power they still never accomplish anything and when it&#39;s required they still pass the evil shit).</p>

<p>It&#39;s an illusion. They&#39;re all on the same side; even the ones that don&#39;t realize it. Both sides are shit. The few genuine good people on both sides are just used for face and to waste the energy of people willing to work to change things while the rest of us just sit around and whine how bad the dems or reps are.</p>

<p>This is why democrats barely put any work or funding into down ballot. They just want the face of the country to appear like a good person so we all feel comfortable. They don&#39;t care to fight for majority control so that their votes actually matter because they don&#39;t WANT their votes to actually matter. They want the same things as the republicans while appearing to vote against those interests because their votes don&#39;t actually matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your points. But you realize that just because you found some similarities, doesn&#39;t mean there are no differences.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Both Cats and Dogs have eyes</p></li>
<li><p>Both Cats and Dogs have a nose</p></li>
<li><p>Both Cats and Dogs are furry</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can you claim that cats are the same as dogs? Of course not. Pointing similarities doesn&#39;t nothing be demoralized people. </p>

<p>There are good politicians. 
* Bernie Sanders wants to end prohibition
* Bernie Sanders wants  audit the Federal Reserve
* Bernie Sanders wants to end illegal wiretapping
* Bernie Sanders blames the banks</p>

<p>See how that works. I&#39;m not saying Bernie is perfect. But throwing your hand up with the the false equivalency argument does no one any good. </p>

<p>Instead we need to find the Good candidates from the left and the Right. If all Republicans were fiscally conservative, socially liberal like Bill Well, I&#39;d vote (R) down ballot. But their not. So we need to stay active and encourage others to hep fix the broken system.</p>
