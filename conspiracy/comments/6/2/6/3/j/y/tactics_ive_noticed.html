        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start by saying I do not support anyone in our political system. For as corrupt as it is, I must presume majority of the people are compromised or have bad intentions to begin witg. I do not support Trump nor do I think he will save us or help us, that being said he is damn better than Hillary or Obama. I believe in the individual man and his ability, the &quot;men&quot; leading the country are neither men and they are devoid of ability. </p>

<p>That being said I have noticed when important topics are posted here such as Pedogate, the WikiLeaks, the 650k emails, the war in Yemen and Fukushima all start gaining traction they quickly devolve into political and partisan rhetoric. I believe the people sent here to derail our conversations have been using Trump as an effective tool. Since more people on this sub are Anti-Deep State than not alot of them side with Trump. I believe the shills have figured this out and use it to create arguments that get people banned for calling others shills or completely makes all participants in the discussion lose interest once it becomes a he-said-she-said-thing. Ignore the partisan opinions unless the topic is politics, if we don&#39;t respond to their hatred and skills of directing the awareness of the audience we can break another one of there weapons. Stay vigilant, don&#39;t give in to their agression. I&#39;m guilty of it too and it&#39;s something I have come to realize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This accusation is common, but it seems to me just a way to shut down criticism of actual corruption on the left.  Have you read Trance-Formation of America?  Real investigation of government corruption rarely claims all its victims on one side.</p>

<p>Trump, like Obama before him, was elected on a promise of transparency.  He too may prove unworthy as Obama was before him.  It&#39;s worth remembering that the quest for governmental transparency is a common pulse of Americans which transcends partisan divides, leading to activist bases that vote for Obama and then Trump on the very same endeavor: to seek an outside voice who brings a hope of change, that we may make America a nation worth being proud of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying the complete opposite of what I&#39;m saying. Just because there&#39;s corruption on one side does not mean there isn&#39;t corruption on the other side that should not also be acknowledged.

    <div class="md"><p>Well part of that is maybe because the media has been in full bore criticism of Trump for the last 15 months. If you want a discussion of the Trump-Russia connection, for example, you can just turn on the TV or go to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> or check out any one of the 20+ anti-trump subs.

    <div class="md"><p>It seems most of the &quot;political&quot; leaning types that lean right are folks that give conspiracies some amount of legitimacy.  I am sure if the left quit hammering Trump everyday in every sub this stuff would fade eventually.  It&#39;s all very reactionary at this point.  Maybe if the mods would stress that posts should only be about legitimate conspiracies maybe things would change.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually mentioned in a similar thread that part of the problem might be from Xposting to politics and/or t_d. It seems like that tactic brings on brigades of people that aren&#39;t interested in the actual conspiracy theory but only what they perceive as a partisan lean. </p>

<p>The reason this Russian conspiracy seems so fake to me is that their isn&#39;t actually and event to work backwards from...unless you mean the hacking/leaking of the DNC and Podesta emails. Trump hasn&#39;t done anything policy-wise to favor Russia (as far as I know), and the people investigating haven&#39;t come remotely close to demonstrating collusion. So yeah, maybe the Russian&#39;s did hack the Dems and revealed their dirty laundry. But here argument breaks down: are we supposed to turn a blind and give the DNC a free pass because it MAY have been a Russian agent that figured out Podesta&#39;s email password?</p>

<p>When Trump actually implements policy to help Russia in some way, i.e. easing sanctions or something then I&#39;ll get excited. But right now if you are arguing that us getting to see behind the curtain into the DNC corruption, and voting accordingly is &quot;one of the biggest conspiracies in American history&quot; I&#39;m going to call bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are too many connections between Trump and Russia for there not to be something there. That, with the lies told by him and his administration are pretty strong indicators that it isn&#39;t &quot;nothing&quot;. Trump is in favor of getting rid of sanctions on Russia. He and <em>a lot</em> of members of his administration stand to gain from dropping the Russian sanctions. </p>

<p>I have no problem investigating corruption by the DNC. But, honestly, there&#39;s about as much evidence that what was done by the DNC was pretty small. Bernie wasn&#39;t winning over moderate democrats (as much as I wish he would have). </p>

<p>My biggest problem is the poster talking shit about a conspiracy theory and completely accepting others on a conspiracy sub. Who are they to tell someone that the conspiracy they believe in shouldn&#39;t be talked about? </p>

<p>Is it 100% true? I have no idea. But this isn&#39;t r/inthenews or r/news, this is r/conspiracy. That&#39;s a valid &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and as such, has all the freedom in the world to be discussed in this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that Trump didn&#39;t have connections to Russia. I&#39;m arguing that the Trump-Russia thing is not really a valid conspiracy theory because a) it&#39;s a mainstream and wildly accepted story not a fringe theory and it&#39;s being actively and publicly investigated and b) so far Trump has not demonstrated any more favoritism towards Russia than previous administrations as far as concrete actions so we have yet to have the &quot;conspiracy&quot; part actually come into effect. </p>

<p>My own beliefs on the matter aside, I really can&#39;t take you seriously if you are saying you can&#39;t find a place to discuss the Russia stuff. You are free to post topics to this sub just like everyone else. If the information or theories that are posted are new and aren&#39;t represented on the other 30 subs I mentioned, then I guarantee you will get traction. But you don&#39;t get to throw a hissy fit because others aren&#39;t buying to the same recycled hysteria that you are. </p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t fucking stand this thinking on this subreddit. Are there shills of some sort? Probably. But the majority of us are free-thinking people with no agenda but our own opinions. Someone disagreeing with you or tying the conversation back to <em>the current President of the US</em> if it&#39;s applicable and relevant <strong>does not automatically make them a shill</strong>. </p>

<p>Seriously, when everyone on this subreddit has the same opinions and stops creating discussion or debate, this sub will be dead. I&#39;ve seen more posts than ever before discouraging people from voicing their own opinions or ideas because &quot;if they don&#39;t believe exactly what we believe, they&#39;re a shill&quot;.  </p>

<p>I was called a shill two days ago because I told someone that their argument of &quot;autism being caused by aborted fetuses in vaccines&quot; had absolutely zero evidence to support the claim. The shill calling is out of fucking control on this sub, and it&#39;s incredibly annoying for those who have been here well before the political shit started taking over. </p>

<p>Your problem is right there<sup>.</sup> There <em>is</em> and has never been any difference between the two nominees running in these phony elections for a long time my friend.

<p>How can you still see it as this thing where the outcomes would be different based on the two candidates? Sure they might appoint different cronies, different corrupt organizations will profiteer because they have different circles of friends. But it&#39;s akin to taking two different routes to the same destination of more war, fewer civil liberties, more taxes, more police state, more unwarranted spying, more illegal weed, more fractional reserve banking, ect...</p>

<p>It&#39;s just the same shit dude. I&#39;m sorry to tell you, but part of being a conspiracy theorist is being able to accept the fact that the elite get their way regardless of who wins these elections. </p>

<p>Trump hasn&#39;t drones anyone yet but I&#39;m sure he will soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have news for you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FROM THE START of his presidency, Donald Trump’s “war on terror” has entailed the seemingly indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people in the name of killing terrorists. In other words, Trump has escalated the 16-year-old core premise of America’s foreign policy — that it has the right to bomb any country in the world where people it regards as terrorists are found — and in doing so, has fulfilled the warped campaign pledges he repeatedly expressed.</p>

<p>The most recent atrocity was the killing of as many as 200 Iraqi civilians from U.S. airstrikes this week in Mosul. That was preceded a few days earlier by the killing of dozens of Syrian civilians in Raqqa province when the U.S. targeted a school where people had taken refuge, which itself was preceded a week earlier by the U.S. destruction of a mosque near Aleppo that also killed dozens. And one of Trump’s first military actions was what can only be described as a massacre carried out by Navy SEALs, in which 30 Yemenis were killed; among the children killed was an 8-year-old American girl (whose 16-year-old American brother was killed by a drone under Obama).</p>

<p>In sum: Although precise numbers are difficult to obtain, there seems little question that the number of civilians being killed by the U.S. in Iraq and Syria — already quite high under Obama — has increased precipitously during the first two months of the Trump administration. Data compiled by the site Airwars tells the story: The number of civilians killed in Syria and Iraq began increasing in October under Obama but has now skyrocketed in March under Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The patterns and accounts used have become obvious.  We can all name dozens of users who are clearly against this community and we all see the tactics. Things to look out for are things like &quot;This place&quot; and &quot;you guys&quot;.  Also the &quot;we already knew this&quot; for the &#39;nothing to see here&#39; tactic.  There is the &quot;this makes us all look bad&quot; tactic as well. Don&#39;t forget the &quot;hurr anyone who disagrees with me is a shill&quot; line used to muddy the waters. And you touched on the biggest one, the pivot to political bullshit.  It&#39;s important to remember politics is spammed relentless on this sub by bots (sort by new) in an attempt to keep us from organizing.  PG was a wake up call, we organized, researched, and shared...That absolutely cannot happen again.  There are more bots and turfers than users want to admit, much of what happens in here is inorganic. However, they are obvious in their disdain for this community, nothing is ever a conspiracy and it is always about a political false idol...Call those fucks out, downvote them.  We have to fight back.  We have to stop playing by a different set of rules.  Be coy, be smart, don&#39;t get banned but let them know that we know.  Authentic users catch on quickly and we are still picking up genuine free thinkers along the way</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we read the same post/article. Something about they could only convincingly adjust by 10 or 12% without getting caught, and the actual vote exceeded that. So, they could have pushed their tools harder, but they would have gotten caught. Does that sound familiar?</p>

<p>I have no great love for Trump, but I do wish there was a way we could know what the real vote count was. There is no denying the power and enthusiasm of that movement. I just wish it could be harnessed for something more productive. If all of those people could be gathered under a new party it might actually do some good, and if it wasn&#39;t for Trump I think it would grab even more reasonable people. He kind of tainted the whole thing by being himself lol.</p>

<p>I think I country can only survive if all member share the same beliefs. When you split a country into two sets of ideologies and have the two side get elected every other election and the longest they can be on office is 8 years then nothing really gets done except for arguing. I&#39;m not saying we need one leader or we need a king or anything. Every political system in the world is failing so obviously we need to create a whole new thing.

<p>I have this totally crazy idea, why not get rid of parties and instead the candidates can say what the like and want to do, we can evaluate that against what they have historically done whenever possible, and then we vote on the one that most resembles our goals. Completely autonomous from any block of party platform and standards? I know, I know, they should lock me up in the looney bin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the quote from the hitch hiker&#39;s guide to the galaxy- </p>

<p>It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see...&quot;
&quot;You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, &quot;nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.&quot;
&quot;Odd,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;I thought you said it was a democracy.&quot;
&quot;I did,&quot; said Ford. &quot;It is.&quot;
&quot;So,&quot; said Arthur, hoping he wasn&#39;t sounding ridiculously obtuse, &quot;why don&#39;t people get rid of the lizards?&quot;
&quot;It honestly doesn&#39;t occur to them,&quot; said Ford. &quot;They&#39;ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they&#39;ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&quot;
&quot;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&quot;
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Ford with a shrug, &quot;of course.&quot;
&quot;But,&quot; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &quot;why?&quot;
&quot;Because if they didn&#39;t vote for a lizard,&quot; said Ford, &quot;the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;I said,&quot; said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, &quot;have you got any gin?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll look. Tell me about the lizards.&quot;
Ford shrugged again.
&quot;Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happenned to them,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone&#39;s got to say it.&quot;
&quot;But that&#39;s terrible,&quot; said Arthur.
&quot;Listen, bud,&quot; said Ford, &quot;if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say &#39;That&#39;s terrible&#39; I wouldn&#39;t be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin.

    <div class="md"><p>Voting matters. Candidates will pander to the demographics that vote for them, even if they are religious nuts that only care about abortion. Not voting causes candidates to not even bother addressing the issues you care about, because they don&#39;t believe they&#39;re going to get sufficient votes from you to justify the effort. They can also lose other demographics by doing so.</p>

<p>The problem is the expectation that voting alone will fix the problems. It never will. We have to force the representatives to represent us after we elect them. They have to beg the corruptors for money for hours each day just to get enough money to appeal to us with political propaganda. If we don&#39;t hear about them, we won&#39;t even know they exist.</p>

<p>This <em>voting doesn&#39;t matter</em> rhetoric serves the economic elites that want their moles in power, to cut taxes on the rich, to end social programs that tax the rich that the rich don&#39;t even need, and to gut regulations that cost the rich profits but protect workers, customers and the environment. They get the anti-abortion voters, the xenophobic voters and the low information voters to vote for their moles. </p>

<p>This might seem partisan, but it&#39;s just the way it is. Workers and owners have competing self-interests. They always have and always will. Basic math clearly shows the relationship. We play a game of tug of war between workers&#39; wages &amp; benefits and owners&#39; profits. This plays out in politics and, worldwide, the parties that claim to represent the workers are huge targets for corruption. That&#39;s why, even though the party that pays lip service to working class interests wins, it needs an engaged public to keep it focused on serving the working class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if I&#39;m coming across as rude - I may be unfairly lumping this thread in with the recent influx of shill accusations and Cheney posts basically telling people what they&#39;re allowed to believe.</p>

<p>Regardless, &quot;Pedogate, the WikiLeaks, the 650k emails&quot; threads are almost always partisan/political. They just aren&#39;t targeting Trump. The most recent WL stuff about the CIA isn&#39;t inherently partisan, but it was definitely used as a means of discrediting the Trump/Russia investigation.</p>

<p>What bothers me (and this is less about your post than the general trend) is that there are never enough frontpage posts calling Hillary/Podesta Moloch-worshipping pedophiles to make people complain about shills and politicization. It&#39;s only when Trump starts getting badmouthed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This election it wasn&#39;t the candidate people were voting for imho, it was the people behind the candidate. I say that because I feel like a lot of the trumpers were decent well meaning people, they all get a bad rap...some deserve that rap. Same with Sanders. It is almost as if you did not like Clinton you were stigmatized or something...hmmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the whole &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; mentality and the constant worrying about what &quot;they&quot; are doing. </p>

<p>Look guys, some of us have been digging into Hollow Earth, HARP, FEMA, Trafficking, 9/11, Sandy Hook, Aurora, Dallas, and...... and there has been an opposition to everyone of those things be it here, 4chan, Godlike, ATS, YouTube.</p>

<p>Filter out the &quot;shills&quot;, don&#39;t respond to&quot;them&quot;, up-vote comments and threads that YOU feel more eyes should see, search for the truth, read the facts, and make an opinion for yourself. Stop waiting for the &quot;masses to awaken&quot; and start coming up with ideas and plans to fix the problem. We&#39;re all human beings here (I think...?) use the greatest gift we were ever given, your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this, responding to the them just gives them the opportunity to shill even more and starting an argument with them allows other shills to join and blend in. Shill posts become more obvious in their desperation when they continue posting without any response, and blatantly redundant when they are left to post among themselves in complete agreement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The topics you listed, with the exception of Yemen and Fukushima, are implicitly political and would there for be discussed within a political framework. Pizzagate, Wikileaks and the Emails all made one U.S. political party look dubious.  There is no denying that.  These things had influence in a major election.  Their origins and or validity are inherently political.  It has nothing to do with &quot;tactics.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you suspect someone is a shill, I suggest replying to their post, and immediately blocking them once they respond. I&#39;ve noticed that shills will ALWAYS respond to ANYTHING you write to them. They are paid to have absolutely no shame and post as much trash as possible. By tricking them into responding to you, they will respond 99% of the time, and from there you can block them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing this for a month now and my reddit experience has been significantly better without these morons. If everyone does this, soon it will be shill-on-shill infighting and a massive (well, even more massive) waste of money.</p>
