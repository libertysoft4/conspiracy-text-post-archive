    <div class="md"><p>I think he is serious, because Clinton has some serious skeleton and her campaign drew no where near as many people as Trump.  Also, she barely campaigned, Obama did more rally&#39;s in the last 2 weeks than she did in a month.  Lastly, it wasn&#39;t the Podesta emails/Russian influence, it was Comey reopening the investigation that really hurt her chances.</p>

<p>The funny thing is no one is talking about the clear astroturfing that popped up in r/politics 4-6 months prior to the elction.  Or the fact that T_D blew up because it was one of a few subs who actually discussing &amp; combed through what was in the Podesta emails everyday.  You couldn&#39;t even discuss them in r/politics, it&#39;s the only reason I subbed to T_D was to see the daily threads.  I didn&#39;t vote for either btw, just pointing out the reality of that situation.</p>

well one was from sputnik and had been published literally ten minutes before, throwing up questions about exactly when trump saw it, and has since disappeared from the internet.  The other described a fake terror attack, like wholly made up.</p>

<p>I suspect he saw it. </p>

<p>I claim Ockhams razor. </p>

<p>Think about it, Trump is the equivalent of your dad actually knowing how to use the internet, but trying to cozy up to 16 year olds. </p>

<p>We know that because he himself has delivcered extensive proof. I mean, shit, when haven&#39;t his habits to tweet at 3 AM made news? </p>

<p>Lets face it, he has extensiveply provided that he has the cellphone usage habits of a 17 year old. </p>

<p>So yea. Hillary spends her last moments before a debate apparently going over her stuff, making sure she is top prepared, while I BET Trump surfs the net, nd gets himself a dose of his own favorite compliments. </p>

<p>Is it so hard to believe that Trump actually does not prep for his interviews / debates, and prefers to last minute surf around? I mean, heck, his ego is swollen, his hairpiece is on point, what&#39;s up with the rest? </p>

<p>To make this about &quot;Throwing up legitimate questions about when trump saw it&quot; is like going, &quot;The chicken is outside the cage. The door was open, it has a history of pecking the lock open, It has driven 4 owners crazy, can this hicken teleport, legitimate question?&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the director of the FBI under oath saying he wasn&#39;t wiretapped.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What does Russia have to do with Seth Rich</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the DNC, &quot;Russian hackers&quot; were the culprits behind the initial DNC email leaks. This was pretty much where the whole &quot;Russians are hacking the election&quot; nonsense began. The second set of leaks, the Podesta emails, contains exchanges between Podesta and other DNC insiders regarding the suspected leaker of the first batch, who was admittedly within the party, and how he/she needed to be made an example of. Seth Rich was murdered shortly after.</p>

<p>The Russian hackers/Russian trolls narrative is designed to do three things: </p>

<p>1) Make you question your faith in our republic 
2) Implicate Trump in some kind of fantastical tale of Russian espionage (evidence coming any month now...) 
3) Deflect attention away from their own ineptitude. </p>

<h1>3 is important because they claim Russian hackers, but in reality one of two things likely happened. A) Podesta received an obvious phishing email and clicked a malicious link, thereby compromising his personal info (you can view this email for yourself). Or B) Someone guessed Podesta&#39;s password, which was literally &quot;p@ssw0rd&quot;.</h1>

<p>All the Russian stuff is bogus. If it weren&#39;t, we&#39;d have something concrete by now. If the Establishment were smart they&#39;d put to good use that software that allows you to leave an artificial fingerprint on any type of digital document. Trump was right about one thing, our leaders truly are incompetent.   </p>

<p>But think, if nothing came out prior to the election, what makes you think they have something on him? THEY WANTED THEN ELECTION, they been spying on him knowing everything he does, and they still fucking lost. They have nothing. Think. Why wouldn&#39;t they of dealt their biggest blow before the election?</p>

<p>Their biggest blow was the pussy thing, the second was the taxes, which was a joke, and the last is the Russians --TBA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does Hillary have to do with anything, she&#39;s not the president. Trump is, this is about him and what he may or may not have done. 
Do i have an evidence? not at all, I just think it&#39;s odd that he want&#39;s to be all BFF with Putin and was talking about lifting sanctions on Russia.</p>

<p>To me that strikes me as odd, why would he do that? What Russia has been doing the the Ukraine is total BS and prior to the election the GOP was on Obama about how we needed to act and that Obama was being weak. </p>

<p>Now trump is in and suddenly it&#39;s a totally different tune and he wants to lift sanctions? Why? Add in Flynn who now is asking for immunity while he himself said last fall that if you ask for immunity your prob guilty of something. I get the feeling that something is up... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like they can just boot him out of the presidency. It&#39;s a process. And if he&#39;s found guilty of something after going through that process, he should be impeached. Simple as that. I think generally people agree with that and I think the FBI has followed that process so far. </p>

<p>The thing I don&#39;t like about all this is that everyone just assumes that the deep state, MSM, etc is out to get Trump. Could it just be that maybe he&#39;s kind of an idiot and actually did something wrong? Most people literally will not even entertain that idea. </p>

<p>And because of Trump, im just supposed to trust him but not trust the msm? Because the msm has an evil agenda and trump I guess doesn&#39;t? I mean wtf, no way. I don&#39;t trust either of them. </p>

<p>The thing I do know is they&#39;ve been caught lying several times regarding the Russian deal. And if it looks like a rat, smells like one, well we might just have some rats on our hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The answer is still unclear, and Democrats in Congress want to get to the bottom of it with an investigation&quot;</p>

<p>The question was for EVIDENCE, not an opinion piece with the pricetag painted over. </p>

<p>The article, by the way, paints more of a picture of &quot;Everybody who has ever had any connections with russia is suspect&quot;. I mean, I agree, but come on, it is 2017. The iron curtain has been down for how many years? Is it illegal to invest in foreign corporations? Or are you now suspect when you drive a car that was manifactured in a soviet country?  </p>

<p>Just look at the section on wikileaks. </p>

<p>&quot;OMG, appeared on RT&quot;, is given as evidence, and not a single word is mentioned towards &quot;It is illegal to read the leaks yourself&quot; &quot;No need to look at the leaks yourself&quot; &quot;The FBI will have a word with you if you look at the Leaks yourself&quot;CNN, Or the often cited MSM philosophy to act as an ( hopefully) unpaid press station of the DNC (Though after the ringing endorsements of Clinton in the &quot;Gleichschaltung der Presseorgane&quot; 2016.... Little hope remains...). </p>

<p>&quot;OMG, he has visited the GRU. &quot; As director of the defense intelligence agency, I would suppose it is their job. Kind of like, when the german head spymaster in chief comes by, you take him on the special tour of Langley, so you can show off a bit. You know, serve him hand roasted Langley coffee, and casually make it seem like you use the good china every day. </p>

<p>And picture seven... I can play three degrees of suspicious activity as well. I mean, seriously, did you have to drag out the sexual history? You think Billy Boys blowjob was so easily forgotten? I mean, hey, it&#39;s cool to go, we respect women, but to then go, &quot;AAH, she is said to have dated Putin ( but she denies it)&quot;.... Hey Politico, aren&#39;t you &quot;said&quot; to take Soros Money to an extend where he owns you mind body and soul, and you basically have no other possibility then to print his propaganda? Did you just deny it? Can we take that as evidence for a thinkpiece? </p>

<p>I usually took Politico as a good source. You know, as someone who still did journalism. Ah well....</p>

Their presence doesn&#39;t disappear occasionally like we see with other astroturf campaigns. Their presence doesn&#39;t ever suddenly increase 500 fold almost overnight. And it makes sense that people here would like Trump. People interested in conspiracies are more likely to like Trump due to him having vocally supported conspiracy theories in the past. He calls out the corporate media for being liars just like we all do here on a daily basis. He&#39;s not one of us, but with the corporate media&#39;s deceptive help, he does a good job of looking like he&#39;s one of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey my bad man, wasn&#39;t trying to build a straw man. I just know people on here act like everything is so anti-Trump. But my honest view on it is that I see way more pro-Trump posts here than anti-Trump. It wasn&#39;t until that ISP bill the other day that I first saw waves of anti-Trump stuff. Which was mainly directed at republicans in general.</p>

<p>I think the presence of anti-Trump supporters grows in here because this is one of the few places I can banter with Pro-Trump supporters and not get banned right away. That&#39;s definitely why I come here, I am extremely confident that is why a lot of other people like me come here too. Hence why the numbers can fluctuate a lot. I also like conspiracies too. </p>

<p>But since I accuse Russians of having bot farms, it wouldn&#39;t be fair for me to assume that in some form the leftists don&#39;t have something like that going on too. So I&#39;ll give you that for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bulk of Russian trolls are on Russian websites brainwashing their own population. Some smaller percentage of course is also on reddit.</p>

<p>In the same way that the bulk of Western-Sponsored trolls are on reddit, facebook, twitter, etc... While some smaller percentage reaches out to more foreign websites.</p>

<p>This is how propaganda actually works. You don&#39;t fight the uphill, losing battle against people from completely different world-views, you distort the world-views of your own people.</p>

<p>This is why the OP is completely right. People calling out &quot;da Russians&quot; while ignoring the fact that their own website is full to the brim with sponsored content and manufactured consensus = hypocrites.</p>

<p>two wrongs dont make a right, but the media only shows what they want to. in this case, they are more interested in going against trump then they were against clinton. they are both fucking terrible. but who is the more obvious target? the person who has been in politics for decades and was at the top of a party, or the outsider celebrity questionable billionaire business man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re just interested in going after Trump because he says a lot of stupid shit. He&#39;s easy to like and he&#39;s easy to not like. </p>

<p>I think this whole &quot;MSM fake news&quot; thing created by Trump is so ironic too. Because you have all these people criticizing the media for being so anti-trump. Saying everything they publish is made up lies to smear Trump. Fake news! </p>

<p>But then they&#39;ll go and follow Trump blindly and not question a single thing he puts out there. Instead of the msm agenda, it&#39;s the trump agenda. Effectively just doing the same damn thing they&#39;re criticizing the media for. The only difference is Trump is the president. </p>
