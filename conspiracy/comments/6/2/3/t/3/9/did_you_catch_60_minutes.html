        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The story getting most of the attention from 60 minutes is the Cernovich part of the story on fake news.  In the first story 60 minutes proved another believed conspiracy to be true.  The Dallas investigator seemed like he was awakening on camera.  There were many questions he wanted to ask the FBI, but he was unable to get any answers.  The story was about the 2014 shootings in Garland, TX.  Where two terrorist planned to kill a lot of people at a contest to draw the prophet Mohammed.   For context :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/us/garland-texas-prophet-mohammed-contest-shooting/">http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/us/garland-texas-prophet-mohammed-contest-shooting/</a></p>

<p>An FBI agent was in contact with these individuals months before the attacks, the agent was in Garland at the time of the attack, and the agent followed the two in a car to the site of the attack.  60 minutes did all but say the FBI helped plan the attack.  </p>

<p>I question why this was on 60 minutes so open and in public.  The media is now driving distrust between the public and law enforcement, which generally means the people in power want it to be this way.  </p>

<p>I thought this was interesting, it is the first story on the show.  Check it out for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only Yuri Bezmenov I know of, defected from the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War and died about 25 years ago. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that what he had to say about those Soviet agencies is true about any of the strictly Russian ones at this point in history.</p>

<p>Russian nationalism and all the more ordinary conventions of freedom of religion, private ownership, open markets and competition in business have all been completely restored in Russia on the same footing as exists throughout most of Europe.</p>

<p>In short there no longer is the kind of unresolvable ideological conflict between diametrically opposed systems ruthlessly fighting against one another for turf and dominance in the world any more. China is slowly but surely moving in that same direction as well.</p>

<p>The US, however, is determined to prevent Russia from rejoining and re-engaging the rest of Europe on an equal footing as any of the other nations in it because it would strengthen the continental community enough to stand up against being dominated and controlled by the US and Wall St. in particular against it&#39;s own best interests. </p>

<p>In fact the massive bank fraud and financial crisis engineered by Wall St. and  that went completely unpunished by the US government caused all the nations in Europe to lose over half of their value on paper literally overnight and plunged them into the financial mess that has everyone wanting to bail out of the EU and abandon the euro for their own currencies and control over them due to the way the euro was hit by that fraud.</p>

<p>A rather pointed and potent demonstration of who their boss is. Forcing them to agree to placing sanctions on Russia has only rubbed their noses even more in the dirt and cost them billions more in lost trade on top of it. </p>

<p>The vast majority of ordinary Europeans have no grudges against Russia and fully understand what it was protecting the people of Crimea from and also wants to protect the ordinary people of the Donbas and the eastern Ukraine from... namely fanatical nationalist extremists bent on destroying them because they&#39;re Russian speaking Ukrainians and with no regard for the fact that their livelihoods have always been dependent on cross border trading and commerce with Russia for centuries. </p>

<p>The people of the Crimea who are also mainly Russian speaking have a successful and well established economy that is dependent on two major things, the Russian naval base with 25,000 Russian personnel rotating through it and nearly two million tourists from the Russian Federation that vacation there every year. You cut those off and they&#39;d have virtually no source of income or economy at all, yet that is precisely what the US installed government in Kiev wanted to do to them and still intends to do to them if they can ever regain control of the peninsula.</p>

<p>I&#39;m slightly off topic here, but these facts are all important to know and understand as well as the kind of underhanded activities the US government has actually been involved with and what&#39;s behind the so-called Russian narrative that&#39;s being promoted by ex-officials, politicians with an axe to grind, and all the mainstream media.</p>

Comey is keeping the good work from being put out and suppressing info too protect criminals in government. There is a lot hanging around from the previous administration and people in government trying to scorch the ends.

The specifics of her email server&#39;s configuration aren&#39;t important and there is ample evidence to get the case tossed out for lack of intent... he&#39;s got much more important things to nail her to the wall for... like espionage and he&#39;s gonna conduct that investigation out of the public eye... just like the Wiener investigation. FBI ain&#39;t gonna tip it&#39;s hand in such and important case... we won&#39;t hear any shit about it until charges are filed. FBI don&#39;t comment on an open case. He&#39;s not covering up shit...

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t buy it.  Comey had evidence of intent, and even if he didn&#39;t believe that Hillary and her staff discussing using private servers to bypass government observation was intent he certainly had a case for gross negligence.  And yet... </p>

<p>Hillary and Bill will never face charges, they&#39;re too rich and connected, and they likely have leverage on Comey.  If I&#39;m wrong please remind me later, but I doubt that will happen.</p>

<p>If the Weiner laptop is as bad as members of the NYPD implied then he should have been serving warrants ages ago.  Nothing will come of it because the FBI under Comey is a political organisation, not a law enforcement agency.  Nothing will come of it, but please remind me if it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But she lied under oath about the email server. She said those emails were on her server because she didn&#39;t know they were classified. Comey even said that what she did was illegal. Which is hilarious because you don&#39;t need intent at all for that charge. A lot of people can see what went on, like too many people, and it was probably the reason she didn&#39;t get elected. The only thing I&#39;m waiting on is reading the juicy emails she had.</p>

FBI has it allllllll on lockdown at Quantico... they even ended up getting shit <em>everyone</em> thought was deleted... but Platte River had a little &quot;glitch&quot; where they accidentally kept 60 days of emails no one at all knew were there until they stumbled upon them. </p>

<p>If ya read thru the vault releases it becomes pretty evident that they have vast piles of data... I honestly think they may have had the NSA and her phone companies in on the surveillance... but that is pure speculation on my part... but I can &quot;psychically&quot; see thru some of the redactions from too much FBI reading room time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And 5 years later, she still wasn&#39;t held accountable. You can understand why some people are skeptical about her not getting charged right? Especially with everyone saying just wait just wait. I believe the trump admin will do their best, but I don&#39;t think that they get any control over Intel agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there are only really three schools of thought... she innocent, shes guilty and will get away with it, she&#39;s guilty and will be held accountable... </p>

<p>I ascribe to the 3rd school of thought... We&#39;re just gonna have to wait... but I don&#39;t blame anyone if they belive the first couple scenarios... 99.999% of the population doesn&#39;t have the time or attention span to decipher heavily redacted FBI documents and cross reference the redaction codes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really... it would be cool if someone out there had done a teardown of the entire Vault series... but from what I&#39;ve seen only T_D really digs into those files with any fervor... and it is like 15 shitposts for every good piece of info. </p>

<p>The fact that Huma Abedin has been under investigation by the FBI since 2013 and the Counter Terrorism Unit took interest her actions lets me know that something big is cooking... but it is weird that they didn&#39;t redact that info from the 05 release... really the whole thing should be locked up till like 2040, but they had 3 officials sign off on a special &quot;early declassification&quot; exemption like 4 or 5 months ago... it was included in HRC 05 I think... </p>
