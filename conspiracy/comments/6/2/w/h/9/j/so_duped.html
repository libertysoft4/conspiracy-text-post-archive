<p>I am sure governments meddle in each others elections and all,  but so far,  it looks like Trump got enough votes without Russia&#39;s help.</p>

<p>Yeah,  the US election system is rigged.     As is everything else is rigged too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if the election system proper were rigged to any strong effect, would trump have ended up in the white house? he was not liked by his party elite, and anyone with a brain in finance / industry would have seen that he was too much of a wild card. wouldn&#39;t those pulling the strings have preferred status quo over madness? (not to say that his election could be called a &quot;win&quot; over the illuminati or whoever, the only winner here is the kremlin)</p>

<p>seems pretty clear the dnc nomination was indeed rigged, not only from the leaks themselves but the reaction to them was resignation instead of denial.</p>

<p>it&#39;s long since time a green party gained traction the u.s.. that aspect of the system, the difficulty of launching a third party, also rigged rather effectively.</p>

<p>strong effect is subject to a lot of guessing isn&#39;t it?    Certain rigging in California for example was well documented.    Look at the voting map,  county by county in 2016 presidential election,  <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CountyMap2012.main_-800x430.jpg">http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CountyMap2012.main_-800x430.jpg</a></p>

<p>If you are listening to the corporate media,  even PBS,  you are being lied to.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The map shows county by county who won.   It shows the rural areas in contrast to the metro areas.   The easiest place to rig is 30 metros rather than 500 urbans.    Hillary got a lot of the metros,  and in CA it was by letting latino not citizens vote,  partly.</p>

<p>I voted against Trump.  (Jill)  But some people did vote for him,  probably enough for him to win.    Look at the people who came to see him on the campaign trail compared to Hillary!</p>

<p>For sure Trump and his cronies are all corrupt,  but then so was Hillary and all her cronies.    Russia doubtfully made any difference in the election other than a lot of people were turned off by the Hillary Cold War II BS.    We don&#39;t need war with Russia.   They are more like us than we want to admit.   </p>

<p>The US has manipulated dozens of elections in foreign countries.   The Clintons have always collected millions in foreign money,  even in this last election.</p>

<p>You want Trump out and Pence in,  I get it.    Would you have been happy if Hillary won?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>note that &quot;would immediately start a war&quot; is one of the anti-hillary memes, part of the true conspiracy this subreddit has been swimming in.</p>

<p>what i&#39;m saying is that this idea and many others are now questionable. one should now be reexamining everything thought to be true that might have originated from the russian misinformation campaign.</p>

<p>plus, this is the kind of thing i saw on the cover of supermarket tabloids all last fall. if you&#39;re here repeating headlines from the weekly world news, then perhaps you&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>

<p>[woah, that was meaner than i meant to be sorry, just couldn&#39;t help making that point about the tabloids :-) except in the matter of intent and scale, i do agree that there&#39;s lots of manipulation being done by all sides.
i think those on the left would more likely be honest about that, whereas the right will be in denial long after trump is either locked up or on the run]</p>

<p>Also what solid proof has been offered that with out any doubts proofs Russian meddling? What about the reports before the election that everything was checked and secure? Would there have been any questions or concerns if Hillary won? </p>

<p>But when the msm drags the line so hard as they have been, you have to ask yourself is there something more going on? </p>

<p>Is Trump a good fit for president? No, was Hillary or Bernie? No would we really be in a different place now if others won? Nope, Republicans or Democrats;both are evil and want us fighting each other while they continue to screw us already over. </p>

<p>All people need to rise up and stop this bullshit world wide, no Country, religion or person has gotten us to that point and will probably never in my life time. Everyone&#39;s idea of what&#39;s right and wrong varies to some extent someone will always see it as us vs them. </p>
