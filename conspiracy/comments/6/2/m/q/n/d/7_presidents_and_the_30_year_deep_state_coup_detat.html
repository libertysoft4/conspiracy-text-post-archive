    <div class="md"><p>They are not.  I&#39;ll reproduce a post I just made:</p>

<p>We know Manafort joined the Trump campaign on March 29th.  Breitbart added metadata for &quot;Russian&quot; bot indexing two days later on March 31 (Yandex search engine).  Breitbart was the only major US facing website to include Yandex metadata at the time.  The FBI is investigating both Breitbart and infowars based, in part, on this highly unusual inclusion of metadata tags to make their content easily parsable by &quot;foreign&quot; bot nets.</p>

<p>One of two things is true:</p>

<ul>
<li>the spam bots are foreign (&quot;Russian&quot;)</li>
<li>the spam bots are domestic (CIA)</li>
</ul>

<p>If we want to attribute the bot nets as genuinely foreign in nature, then the Trump internet campaign looks really bad but isn&#39;t illegal (actual Russian botnets aiding Trump isn&#39;t illegal).  On the other hand, if the botnets are originated by the CIA we&#39;re looking at a domestic propaganda campaign by US intelligence services.  Now you can see why the &quot;Russians hacked us&quot; stuff is actually a <em>defense</em> of Trump rather than an attack - it is the best possible spin they can put on what really went down.  Unfortunately Obama legalized domestic propaganda with the 2013 NDAA so again not something that can be prosecuted directly, but the fact that the CIA was in the bag for Trump through the campaign is going to put a real damper on the whole fighting the establishment BS, never mind inconvenient facts like still no independent prosecutor for Hillary as promised, no big pedo arrests, etc.  The sham is falling apart.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is the same thing they did to cover Obama&#39;s CIA past.  Remember the birther rabbit hole that led nowhere that Clinton and Trump pushed everyone down?</p>

<p>Same thing here.  Clinton starts this &quot;Russian&quot; narrative that is BS to cover up Trump&#39;s CIA past and the domestic propaganda campaign run by the CIA on Trump&#39;s behalf during the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually makes a lot of sense. Definitely going to consider this theory on the &quot;Russia&quot; story as it continues to pollute the news.</p>

<p>Curious, why did you make the jump and include Infowars in the first paragraph. You mention Breitbart using the Yandex metadata, which I have seen before, but how does that relate to Infowars?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI is looking at both sites for ties to the pro-Trump botnets.  Beyond that, it is well known that Alex is a CIA cointelpro operation.  People like Roger Stone, mentored by the CIA sex ring operator Roy Cohn (same as Trump), and infowars were primary drivers of the content that was then amplified by the botnets.</p>

<p>Comey wanted to go public about the botnets before the election and Obama ordered a stand down on it.  How about that?  The faux hostility between Trump/Obama isn&#39;t any more genuine than the fighting between Clinton/Obama that started the birther rabbit hole 8 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have followed Infowars and Alex Jones for over 15 years, originally when I was attending college in Austin. What evidence is there of him being CONITELPRO? I see this theory a lot, but it has no weight behind it. </p>

<p>He&#39;s obviously capable of making mistakes and if Trump is a con, what is to say Jones wasn&#39;t fooled? I&#39;m open to the idea of Trump and Infowars both being giant cons, but there needs to be better evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should be able to tell from your common sense if nothing else.  How can it be that someone &quot;going after&quot; pedophiles with millions of listeners doesn&#39;t get whistleblowers contacting him daily?  In general, infowars / Alex Jones doesn&#39;t do any original reporting.  They regurgitate mainstream news: &quot;i&#39;ve got the articles!  i&#39;ve got the public papers!&quot;  It&#39;s comical if you step back and think about it: his whole shtick is based on mainstream reporting, but he claims he is anti-mainstream?  But it is also deeply evil in that he is a honeypot for whistleblowers: you know he gets naive followers sending him good information, but you never hear from these people.</p>

<p>In his defense, people who do original work get killed.  Even presidents like Kennedy.  It isn&#39;t much of a defense though because he knows this but pretends that he is &quot;safe&quot; because of his size or reach, when in actual fact he is safe because he doesn&#39;t rock the boat at all and even runs psy-ops on the public on top of that: birtherism, Trump support, etc.</p>

<p>Beyond that, people who have rocked the boat have consistently determined him to be a fraud: Bill Cooper, Stew Webb, etc.  People who were killed, attacked, imprisoned for their efforts.  Alex&#39;s selection of guests are also cointelpro: people like Ted Gunderson, Pete Santilli, Luke Rudowski, Jason Burmas, Mark Dice, etc., are well known disinfo agents that Alex heavily promoted in the 9/11 truth days.  Now, most of his regulars are affiliated with the Rothschild-funded Council for National Policy.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;d like you to stop and really think about the claims he makes about being in touch with &quot;highest levels&quot; of the government like former joint chief chairman or some such.  You know the NSA listens to every single thing such people say right?  And you know they get rolled up and tossed in jail if they share anything right?  These people don&#39;t have normal constitution rights, they signed away their free speech with secrecy agreements and get canned for violating them in a heartbeat.  So, for Alex to be talking to these folks in any meaningful way (which he claims he is) means that Alex has a security clearance.  Or Alex is just lying and making it all up.  That&#39;s not true - he is talking to the - but he is also a CIA asset with clearance running disinformation programs so it is allowed.</p>
