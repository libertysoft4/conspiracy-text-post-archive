        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I tend to be fully believing of the concept that candidates/presidency are pre-selected, and elections are rigged as much as is reasonable so that it isn&#39;t obvious that votes were tampered with.</p>

<p>But i guess what I&#39;m having trouble figuring out is why were such controversial candidates chosen?  I understand that a major perk is that the amount of division created in this election was truly legendary, and while quite a few people got red pilled via this, theres probably even more people who are deeper asleep/ingrained into this narrative, because it is very sitcom-like;</p>

<p>but that would mean this decision to use these actors must have been a hail mary play, as if they really needed something huge to keep the public occupied because they saw some sort of danger incoming - but if it wasn&#39;t a hail Mary, due to desperation, wouldn&#39;t it have been a lot easier to use some semi-nobodies with clean records who were just actors for the deep state/establishment?  </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it save them the trouble of potentially dragging many plebs (like myself) into conspiracy land, because they wouldn&#39;t accidentally be red pilling so many people with all of the election propaganda and the leaks and the pedogate shit ect. I really wouldn&#39;t be even on here if this election never occurred - I was a perfectly content sleeping sheep before, and now I entertain everything from the High Level Insider to David Icke to Alex Jones, Jordan Maxwell, wikileaks, and even just learning more about history and understanding how the system works with no strings attached, ect - its like I can&#39;t absorb enough information now.  I feel more potent because i am open to anything, and willing to entertain way more possibilities than before, and logically play them out to see if they make sense/are evidenced.</p>

<p>Why did they do this?  Much like 911, I just don&#39;t believe the main stream narrative to this at all - I tend to believe it is all a big work; but for what reason, I do not know.  Seems sloppy or cumbersome</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dono if i believe this - humans are very hierarchical by nature - we tend to naturally fit ourself into blocks of a pyramid, mostly driven by competition to be at the top.</p>

<p>Just look at your local town - people make deals and do each other favors all the time, and they form social groups and everybody admires the &#39;wealthiest guy on the block&#39; - imagine the culture when the stakes are much higher and the world is &#39;becoming smaller and smaller&#39; - it seems absolutely fitting that a small group of people will astronomical economical worth and power and influence would have their hands in everything, particularly the politics of one of the most powerful and influential countries on earth - that makes sense, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I supposed - seems like a hail mary play - like they needed to do something drastic.  The goal was definitely division, because they propagandized against both actors severely to really hammer home the divide of the public, everybody could feel it - but why the need to divide people so much this year to the point where you are creating conspiracy theorists and pzagaters?  </p>

<p>I feel like you could run a normal business as usual election and still get moderate divide out of it - for some reason, they needed serious division this time.  I wonder what is coming - personally, of all parties including the media, alt media, broadcasters, larpers like fbianon, conspiracy theorists; the claims that make the most sense to me are the high level insiders&#39; perspectives - seems like they are holding on for dear life to their old power in an evolving world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming TPTB exist, I would suggest that the serious division you describe would be the last thing they would want. We are already enslaved to a system...TPTB are already omnipotent, so why create chaos? Seems counterproductive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know from the DNCLeaks, Podesta Emails, and Powell Emails that Hillary was the chosen candidate years ago. I think it probably happened in 2008, in exchange for her not torpedoing Obama. I believe that&#39;s why Obama made her SOS. I can&#39;t think of any other explanation for that move, because hose two really do hate each other, and I mean hate.</p>

<p>We know from those same sources that Hillary and Obama both viewed the Libya thing as her opportunity to earn some commander-in-chief cred by toppling a nation. Obama had nothing to do with it, it was all Hillary. Both her staff and Sid Blumenthal (iirc) said as much. Had it not blown up in her face, that&#39;s all she would have been talking about.</p>

<p>We know from DNCLeaks &amp; Podesta that the DNC purposely elevated Trump. Their plan was to help the more fringe candidates win the primary so they&#39;d be easier to beat in November. They felt they could step right (they did) and win the GOP centrists if they could paint the GOP nominee as extreme right wing. </p>

<p>In 1992 Bill Clinton rescued the DNC from death throes. It&#39;s hard to understand that in retrospect. Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Revolution">1994 Republican Revolution</a> led by Newt. That&#39;s where the country was around that time. Bill Clinton won by being a &quot;new kind of Democrat,&quot; which essentially meant moving the party right on issues like immigration &amp; crime. That party would be dead if not for Bill Clinton. (And Ross Perot.) They owe the Clintons a lot.</p>

<p>Anyway... That&#39;s how the DNC chose Hillary. The superdelegates were all committed to her before the race even started. It was Her turn. I don&#39;t know that anything they did to elevate Trump actually worked, but it was their plan.</p>

<p>As for Trump--and this part is interesting--the GOP, much to their chagrin, probably ensured his win back in 2012. In direct response to Ron Paul&#39;s populist candidacy, they passed a rule change aimed at keeping outsiders like him from ever having a shot at winning the nomination. But because the field was so crowded, and because Trump had a lot of early support, <a href="http://archive.is/kYfuV">that rule backfired &amp; actually prevented them from getting rid of him.</a></p>

<p>tl;dr: Hillary got the nomination because the DNC owed her. She had a lot of chips out &amp; she called them all in. It was a done deal by at least 2013, but possibly as far back as 2008.  Trump got the nomination because he generated a lot of buzz early, and the 40(b) rule change from 2012 ensured that there was no way for the GOP to derail him, however much they may have wanted to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot out there about Hillary being rude &amp; condescending to just about everybody, but I can&#39;t think of anything specific off the top of my head about Obama except for these two, which aren&#39;t exactly on point.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In 2008, Michigan changed its primary date, against DNC rules. All Democrat candidates agreed that, in response, they would not campaign in Michigan and the Michigan primary votes would not count. Barack Obama didn&#39;t even file the paperwork to get on the ballot. Hillary secretly did. And I think maybe she even campaigned there, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m remembering that correctly. Being the only candidate on the ballot she, of course, &quot;won&quot; all of the delegates. She then went out in public &amp; accused Obama of trying to steal the election from her. There is a good video of Obama talking about her being a snake. He&#39;s on a plane at the time. I can&#39;t find that vid, but here&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeGrSjUFaYA">another talking about that situation.</a></p></li>
<li><p>After Obama declared his candidacy, Hillary (reportedly) refused to even acknowledge his presence in the Senate. She wouldn&#39;t shake his hand. If he spoke, she pretended he wasn&#39;t there. I&#39;ve not seen video of this but I have seen/read several people tell the story. I believe the story is true but without a source I&#39;m just some guy on the internet telling tales. Perhaps someone knows of a source. </p></li>

Dont even need to go back to 08. I know without a doubt she was bringing up the birth certificate issue in the 2012 election.

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton did use that Pied Piper strategy, sure.  I think early on, they were worried Jebbers would go much further.  Due to his abysmal personality, people just didn&#39;t connect with him.  It was easy for Trump to knock him out of the running by simply implying he is &quot;low energy&quot;, etc.  But I still think that in their arrogance, the DNC and Clinton&#39;s truly thought the thing was all wrapped up and waiting like a gift just for her.  I still remember a kind of a freak out about 2 weeks prior to the election, when polling wasn&#39;t as strong as they&#39;d predicted.  They had done too much negative campaigning against Trump which often backfires for any candidate.  Clinton should have easily been able to skate through with her time as SOS and many connections and long history in the political world.  But when it comes down to it, people just hate her for many reasons, myself among them.  I didn&#39;t vote for Trump, but I was happy Clinton didn&#39;t get in, and it looks like the result is roughly the same either way.  She would have had Goldman sachs in her cabinet, she would have ramped the war machine right out of the gate, and she would have ignored the wishes of the majority in favor of her wealthy friends looking for favors.  <em>It&#39;s all a big club, and you and I ain&#39;t in the big club.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s razor is a funny bird around here. But, in this particular case I think it applies. Trump simply wasn&#39;t expected to win. We weren&#39;t supposed to intuit the pedophile shit from wikileaks. Tptb got caught on their heels.</p>

<p>But welcome to the weird side. Try not to freak out, entertain everything, but always stay skeptical and believe nothing completely. It is a lot to take in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>READ THE &quot;RUSSIAN HACKS&quot; (Wikileaks)
John Podesta memo say they should choose a &quot;Straw Candidate&quot; from the Republican side that Hillary could most easily beat. Then use their &quot;Friends in the Media&quot; to push him to the front of the pack.
 A short while after this communication HHillary, and or Podesta had dinners with 70 top media people, editors, reporters and anchormen. From television, newspapers, magazines and online media.
What was discussed?
Shorty after that there was Fresh Trump coverage on every news cycle. Did anyone miss that? I wondered just what happened to Cruise, Jeb and the rest. It was like they fell off the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So think about it. I voted for trump but from such a grenade into Washington, had anything really changed? Doesn&#39;t seem like it to me so yet again we have been had I think. Both were the bankers candidates. Everyday that goes by that pedogste isn&#39;t addressed shows us that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they owed the shrew her presidency after promising her 2008 and yanking the rug out from under her for a better, more polished unknown who did what he was told and didn&#39;t get too sloppy being lazy and vindictive.</p>

<p>She kept landing into one mess after another either because she is so arrogant she doesn&#39;t listen to her advisors aka handlers or she feels she can do more and get away with it. And she has... when you order people murdered and have no twinge of conscience repeatedly demanding in White House meetings that Assange be drone bombed you are more than a little out of control.</p>

<p>I guess they figured to throw her a bone and let her illness incapacitate her but get her the historic first female president accolades first.  I cannot imagine with her constant mistakes they would let her stay in. But maybe they really do want WWIII and her hot head at the helm and absolute lack of diplomacy would guarantee it.</p>

<p>And she was laying the ground work as Secretary of State making sure the Middle East was destabilized.  And ISIS well armed.  Ambassador Stevens murdered to silence him about running guns through the so-called embassy at Benghazi.</p>

<p>So how do you get a woman that some people worship fanatically but most distrust at the least and others despise especially the blue collar workers, true progressives and moderates?</p>

<p>You Trump up an absolutely outrageous foil for her character to shine against.  A rich fat cat we&#39;ve all mocked since before I was born.  A person people disliked especially women because he is a sleezeball and always cheating on and divorcing in high profile media exposure.</p>

<p>The perfect white male rich guy who represents all the evils of the world on SJW&#39;s eyes.  And as I understand it he was a &quot;friend&quot; of the Clintons.</p>

<p>He got hired for the new reality show presidential race 2016.  But somewhere, maybe before he agreed to be their stalking horse, he decided to really go fora it.  And I have to say it was an amazing thing to watch and though I try not to be mean spirited I did enjoy watching her hubris take her down and her behavior on election night.  I just wish they&#39;d filmed the tantrum I know she had. =)</p>

<p>As a woman I am so angry even still that our first female President was supposed to be this evil hag who despises me and every American I know.  She trod on our backs to keep her fancy shoes out of mud puddles.</p>

<p>And maybe... just maybe my hatred of her is TPTB manipulation to get Trump in office. I didn&#39;t vote for him but I was tempted because I knew she was the end of us.  But watching MSM and the neocons and Democrats united to bring him down along with Clapper and Comey... well I really do feel they are pissed he won and trying too hard to discredit him.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive read a few times before about the two of them being barely able to even tolerate being in the same room behind closed doors. Got any more about that? I think if this was made more common knowledge then it would help to perfectly illustrate just how much of a farce this entire bread and circus government is to the stubborn folks with their heads still in the sand</p>
