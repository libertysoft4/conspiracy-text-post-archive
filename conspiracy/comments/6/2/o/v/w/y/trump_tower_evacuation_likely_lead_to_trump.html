        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you dont know who globalhell were; they are a defunct hack group from the early 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>I know that because my family works within cyber crime, and digital-forensics investigative communities.</p>

<p>While I am uncertain that this is fully true: From what I was told as a child: Globalhell formed after a 16 year old american hacker was extradited to china for a digital intrusion. I believe it was a military server he struck at the time. For the lulz- From what I recall, the hacker was given a life sentence for his crime which is an important element of our story-</p>

<p>This was the dawning of the internet far before sites like reddit or MySpace came along. Yahoo was big. Google didn&#39;t exist. It was the eris network eurkle and aol that were the key players at the time. People met on yahoo groups like y/ethicalhackers and y/programming-</p>

<p>So, when news of the american hackers sentencing came to light. Sects of hackers from all over the world sought to bring him justice. Trojans were imbedded into masses of chinese machines. Websites defaced. These groups left backdoor exploits into Military, industrial, and public networks alike... It was said that the groups goal was to say: &quot;release the boy&quot; or &quot;we will turn china off.&quot;- hence globalhell-</p>

<p>It was only that in the middle of the planning and execution phases, that the groups intentions were discovered by white hatters; Leading to the arrests of many individuals. Thus ending what once was an amazing achievement in internet history. By a true group of digital warriors, and one&#39;s I grew up to see as patriots-</p>

<p>I am the son of a white hatter-
I grew up being taught by a detective and investigator. Thus envying the complexity of hackers and their ways. Their life stories, goals, and achievements impressed me. People like analyzer99, gary mckinnon, julian assange, kimdotcom, globalhell- these were my baseball teams...
Its their art, dedication, and skills that made them masterful. Clever little cheeky cunts. The smarter they were; The more impressed I was...</p>

<p>Last year during the election, when julian assanges internet connection was severed and his posts dissappeared, i&#39;d felt devistated... like the world lost another hacker and kindred soul... To no better then the likes of hrc herself- That quite rightly set me off from the beginning...</p>

<p>Say what you want about julians service yet its a needed one. Call it a grey area in which humanity needs at times. Much like any hacker would say. The world is full of exploits. There is always a whim and a way-</p>

<p>So at that time due to my parents backgrounds and my childhood rearing, Id taken it upon myself to use this name in the honor of those that came before it... Primarily doing my best on subs like /whereisassange and /wikileaks. To do everything I could &quot;within the law&quot; to push for his identity and safety to be known. I just wanted to know he was safe... It was the similarities which tied to the original goals of globalhell that lead me to taking on the name-
However... The election was another story altogether, and because my families ties and knowledge to the digital forensics communities. When the reports began surfacing of a potential russian / hack on the democtatic party. I&#39;d again lost my anger exponetially.</p>

<p>People talk...</p>

<p>Of the near 2000 government and leo&#39;s working within the cyber crime communities (whom&#39;s networks and names I refuse to name) yet all that cordinate within my families social networks.</p>

<p>Not a single one could verify a means for any party of our nation to ascertain a russian involvment with any level of certainty, based on the information at hand. While coming from a digital forensics investigator with over a decades experience. The bulk of the russian hacking reports are not consistent with any level of expectancy nor evidence to lead the statments in which our media has so carelessly made. &quot;Russia hacked us!&quot;~</p>

<p>&quot;Then prove it!&quot; Give up your tainted illegal server to the fbi&#39;s vetted forensics department, and prove it!-
Because as far as I myself can tell: There are over 2000 cyber security experts that call absolute bullshit on the russian hacking the hrc servers narrative. It&#39;s all based on the information provided by the crowd strike report-
Who could even believe it with the &quot;handles&#39; provided. Not to mention that crowd strike is already redacting statements to the reports. While ukraine has shown impossible connections to the story as it regards information inconsistent with the facts that crowd strike attempted to provide; regarding their own military equipment.</p>

<p>There was so much collusion by the dnc during the election; That I began to fear for this nations security- So from then on I decided to stay globalhell and do my own sort of exploit-</p>

<p>I don&#39;t black hat machines. Yet I know people and I decided enough was enough. (when it came to those people)... So I reached out to the trump administration in the first week of december 2016. Writing multiple accounts in the administrations such as the eric trump foundation, and trump foundation themselves-
I saw a potential for an attack on his tower and newyork. </p>

<p>The attack I assessed was well thought out and mentioned here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>; I just felt and saw the weakness of the DNC and HRC campaign, and felt this looming ominous and sort of desperation growing on their ends. Making me question the works of &quot;guccifer&quot;. If you haven&#39;t read his wikipedia page, I suggest you do! Because you would notice A. He admitted to hacking the HRC server and B. Stated he found evidence of a false flag nuclear attack on Boston. &#39;maybe thats why she wont give her server up for an investigation&#39;??? (who knows)...</p>

<p>So I wrote and I wrote and I wrote the trump family; and I begged his family to take a vacation (just incase, and for their safety). It just seemed relevant that an attack could have in fact been planned...I saw it as the dems failing the polls and their tricks running up. Considering the potential for a hail mary such as an event in the form of a potential device of mass destruction or bomb being delivered to the trump tower itself. Its even in my posting history-</p>

<p>The real shocker (to me at least) came some two weeks later; when a suspiscious unattended package was found inside the trumps building, containing nothing more then childrens toys. (its rather suspiscious)... *the timing-</p>

<p>I believe this was all the conclusion that trump needed to understand that the words I said to him and his family were relevant; - Not in the extent an attack was to occur yet to prove that one was simultaneously occuring; as someone, somewhere, was most certainly and obviously listening...</p>

<p>That was one of the primary and partial intents of my posts. To protect the trump family whom I believe in. As well as guaging the criminal acts of a past administration. Which was potentially surveilling the trump family. As I conveyed my general thoughts in these messages that trump indeed was likely being watched-</p>

<p>If you asked me, why I did what I did...</p>

<p>I did it in the spirit of humanity- For me for you and for our futures...</p>

<p>So was trump aware he was being spied on before then. I don&#39;t know- yet call me optimistic that after the series of events that took place: I think (in a way) he&#39;s absolutely known since the day his tower was evacuated... And Thats exactly why he&#39;s pissed about it...</p>

<p>Because he was tipped off personally by myself afterall...
I can prove I sent these emails. I just can&#39;t prove that anyones read them... </p>

<p>Yet I can say-</p>

<p>Go fuck yourself obama-</p>

<p>Yours truly-</p>

<p>Globalhell-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id posted it earlier yet tbh I didn&#39;t want to draw too much attention to myself. </p>

<p>The way things went dismorning with a brigade on the topic made me feel I&#39;d add more influence to the argument. </p>

<p>Users on these threads pointed out obvious inconsistencies in the case. As well as pointing out the general vulnderabilities and carelessness of the past admin were slaughtered with vote supression and manipulation. </p>

<p>I stand by what I say. </p>

<p>As I have an adept knowledge with how an effective digital forensics process is vetted. By example where is the drive imagine and discovery?</p>

<p>Or why wasn&#39;t the server given to the FBI? </p>

<p>Where are the diagnostic reports showing the tools and procedures utilized to lead to these conclusions. </p>

<p>One doesn&#39;t simply enact a report without a preponderance of evidence, which encapsuls the basis of an international digital intrusion to the secretary of state. </p>

<p>These reports are embarrassing-</p>

<p>They in no way give law enforcement the basis for a working case and the fact they refused their assistance. As well as the assistance of the fbi. Who factually warned them to protect themselves ore hack shows just how completely myopic their parties stance was to these situations in the first place. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had enough of it.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need to throw around hested terms to a russian influence at the beheading of an interprize that was clearly not acting in the people&#39;s nor their own best interest. </p>

<p>I myself refuse to tolerate the entirety of our nation being directed into a war with a nation abroad, so that the existing parties in question can save face. Or escape the fates they have insured for themselves. </p>

<p>Not my cup of tea at all-</p>

The fbi has their own forensics lab- They don&#39;t vet outside sources as evidence. This may be used as testimony. 
However the soc blocked the investigation-</p>

<p>No evidence means no crime. Ergo they have dirt on their devices. What happens from here is up to trump-</p>

<p>My guess is he is plucking the weeds and moles of the past administration. Id suggest he has the white house ran for bigs and the entirety of their cpu network replaced. </p>

<p>It by my opinion is riddled with key loggers and backdoors by the past administration. My guess is that why teumpa taken so many vacations. As I am pretty sure he doesn&#39;t exactly trust anyone at this time-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t evidence. The crowd strike report is testimony. </p>

<p>The fbi has their own forensics lab. Had hrc given them access to her server then all documents found / collected could have been used against her. Ergo shes blocked the investigation. Leaking the crowd strike report as the basis of the russian collusion. </p>

<p>In my opinion trumps weeding out all past administration moles. If I were potus. I&#39;d resecure the WH. Installing an entirely new cpu network. Its likely keylogfed with some sort of back door access. 
Likely why or what he&#39;s already done. As you likely also noticed. A. Entire floor booted out- B. Likely why the vacations took place so early in his career. </p>

<p>I he hasn&#39;t had the white house checked for bugs, and the networks replaced. Imo he isn&#39;t thinking clearly at all. </p>

<p>I&#39;d seriously have the entirety of that building ran over with a fine tooth comb. We are talking decades of vulnderabilities-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t bother me. Maybe make a thread on the thread being suppressed...</p>

<p>Ive virtually done everything I can to promote these in reference to stopping clinton. Killing the russian narrative and doing my best to mitigate the russian hacking narrative. 
These are dnc and hrc shills doing the leg work-
She&#39;s a billionaire with her own pr crew. </p>

<p>At least I sttarted the kindles to to fire. 
From here the rest is up to everyone else on reddit. </p>

<p>So anyone that can see this? 
Pass it on-
;)</p>

<p>Hate how reddits protecting these people-</p>

<p>This will lead to a war with russia if people keep falling for the paid advertiser&#39;s. </p>

<p>Thats the saddest part to me. 
Its a choice
If reddit continues to protect hrc by allowing these false narratives to go on. Eventually leading to impeaching trump.
Russia will no longer maintain the very tactdul composure that we have been truly gifted with-</p>

<p>We were not acting in the worlds best interest these past several years....
There are consequences for that...</p>

<p>Dire and severe consequences:(</p>

<p>Sorry if I got banned. 
This is the second time I tried to get this info out. </p>

<p>Maybe my last attempt if my ip. Is banned-

    <div class="md"><p>Its bigger then that imo. </p>

<p>Ever since hrc lost power everything is walking on egg shells. The propaganda is elevated; and any threads speaking against her; or comments are downvoted and redacted. 
If you want my real opinion...
This has everything to do with 9.11</p>

<p>Because if shes arrested and that comes out-
Americas going to be at a surreal opposition...</p>

<p>If not 9.11 it is something as big as 9.11-</p>

<p>There is a reason shes untouchable-</p>

<p>Thats my thoughts on it. </p>

<p>The reason its big is due to how many people and interests are helping to assist in it. We are talking millions of comments a day. Millions of votes and threads. </p>

<p>This can&#39;t be a simple &#39;paid&#39; strategy. 
Moneys not worth war to the average citizen. </p>

<p>This is the guilty trying to avoid prison. At any cost apparently. As reddit wouldn&#39;t be using their platform against their users unless it was bigger then the mods and their paychecks. </p>

<p>This is far bigger by design. Millions of users. Millions of websites. This is nsa level shilling- likely the whole 5veyes communities. </p>

<p>To me thats how we know this is about absolute corruption.  Its completely drowned out voices screaming for their last breath. While the lifeguards are just standing around listening with no intent to save them. </p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is 9.11 or another event similar. 
We wouldn&#39;t do this for an soc. </p>

<p>This is for the nsa- fully-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a fifth collumn lingering and they are quite relieved to have a new administration taking charge. </p>

<p>Our war efforts were redirected for questionable intents over these past 8 years. Obama and hillarys attempt to overthrow assad by example was a dark chapter in usa history. The isis crisis spawned from libyan loss of leadership. 
The past administration overlooked morality. I feel the bulk of cia is overly enthused to be compliant to the trump families mentality. Were patching the gaps in these past impositions. Yet there is much work to accomplish in a very short amount of time. 
Trumps starting fresh, in an atmosphere long having been corrupted by these individuals. Obamas last move in office was critical to intel services allowing shared nsa intel to be leaked to multiple agencies. This may leave us vulnderable to a wealth of established moles-
Its moves like those that lead our family to believe he was intentionally sabotaging the usa. 
Its a very careless move empowering a wealth of servants of the usa an information bank that not any one core group likely should have ever had access too. This is like taking black mail material on every usa citizens and allowing every intel officer in the states access to it. 
So any one agent that may be a rouge agent can now use this information bank against us. (at any time or date). </p>

<p>Trumps got the bulk support of the agency. Yet I&#39;d advise all us gov intel employees to keep their eyes on their fellow subordinates. Assisting to get any questionable officers information to their operation leaders. 
(if not to the president himself). </p>

<p>Its my express opinion the one agency most protected at this time is the nsa. They give two shits about the administrations. They are national security. They will dedicate their lives to it. Regardless of order. </p>

<p>This is why I feel the cia leaks are taking place. They are informing potus whats been going on through information leaks. (feeding wikileaks). It would make sense as the document dumps are always consistent with relevant events. I.e. wikileaks says what it needs to. Exactly when it needs to. Even if assange isn&#39;t a five eyes operative. He&#39;s doing their work. </p>

<p>To me congress will be weeded next. Followed by those that ran criminal enterprizes under the obama admin. This is why we are seeing all the layoffs. 
Trump is draining the swamp. 
Yet it takes time effort and dedication. </p>

<p>We must be patient, fair and attentful to any parties helping carry any dorectives against our current administration. Or truly. The past administration will regain control. </p>

<p>This is exaclty why I advise a bug sweep in the white house as well as a full on operation to assess exploited digital networks. Essentially. At this time due to obamas choices. We must view him as a traitor and spy. Just as long as we need to, until he can be cleared of these charges. 
Thats what I&#39;d do. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate obama. I simply don&#39;t trust him based on his choices as commander and chief. From obama care to syria. The destruction of international relations to isis. 
These could have all been mistakes. 
I just can&#39;t justify that statement without pointing out. Every mistake could have been completely intentional. 
I.e. a sabatoge. </p>

<p>We fully know that this country has lost its direction. We are now having to regain in. The best thing I can say is we have amazing services and thousands of dedicated operatives that are attempting to do just that. </p>

<p>My only hope is that these agents will unify and stand against the corruption that once took place. 
Because that era is over now-</p>

<p>One day and one step at a time...
We will get this right-</p>
