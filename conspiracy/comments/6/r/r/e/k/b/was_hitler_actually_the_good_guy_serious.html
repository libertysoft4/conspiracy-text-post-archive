    <div class="md"><p>I seriously doubt that. He treated France with silk gloves for instance. A few years ago I&#39;ve even read some new french historic research that came to the conclusion that some french elites even welcomed the invasion to get rid off the increasing influence of the communist groups.</p>

<p>Stalin would have invaded Middle Europe late 1941 if the German troops hadn&#39;t been so successful in the West. The final date for the Russian invasion was set to July 1942 which Hitler wittingly or unwittingly preempted in June 1942.</p>

<p>If you look at this map </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-occupied_Europe#/media/File:World_War_II_in_Europe,_1942.svg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-occupied_Europe#/media/File:World_War_II_in_Europe,_1942.svg</a></p>

<p>you mostly see military administrated territory which was militarily important. The rest were ran by local national governments as vassals or as allies until they imploded like Italy and its territories. </p>

<p>In almost every nation were forces at work during that time which had no real or less regard for human lives. But outside actual war action I can&#39;t see the level of mayhem to happen on the level of Mao or Stalin. You don&#39;t kill millions of people with just a few thousand death squads in Western Europe after the official war action ended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not exactly surprising. People tend to care more about history of their own country/geographic area.</p>

<p>Also china doesn&#39;t talk about it because they don&#39;t want to discuss the major issues of mao. Technically they are still a communist country (though they aren&#39;t in reality of course). Just like you can&#39;t access anything about Tiananmen square </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of jews screwing up the economy isn&#39;t true. Looking at the wall street crash it wasn&#39;t intentional so blaiming the Jews was because of underlying antisemitism</p>

<p>Also the stab in the back (where it was believed Jews sold germany out at the end of ww1) is false. If anything the generals running the country completely freaked out and sued for peace  (though the army had seen a collapse in morale)</p>

<p>Also look at the invasion of the ussr, numerous atrocities  (e.g einsatzgruppen, who killed at least 100,000 jews in cold blood) and their plans upon victory  (hunger plan)</p>

<p>Yes more died under stalin (though you xan argue that all of the deaths from the war in europe/africa were hitler&#39;s fault) but remember how long stalin was jn power compared with Hitler. Especially relevant since until like  &#39;36 Hitler wasn&#39;t strong enough within Germany to go that extreme</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But again, what do you mean? Should we just take everything at face value?</p>

<p>No historian ascribes to that idea of ww2 being just for revenge. There were numerous economic motivations and ideology seperate to versailles. For instance lebens raum, yes it was an idea by the end of ww1 but that was why the nazis  (well one of the major reasons) that they invaded the ussr. </p>

<p>The USA&#39;s is based on their &quot;exceptionalism&quot; belief, for the jews it&#39;s their &quot;chosen by god&quot; and racist belief to keep their group clean, the French had their &quot;Grand Nation&quot; and I don&#39;t think we need to discuss the Brits&#39;s upper class ideology.

<p>And Washington DC and Wall Street. </p>

<p>Hitler&#39;s complaints about some of the Jew&#39;s conduct in pre-WWII Germany is eerily reminiscent of what is happening today. While Hitler correctly deduced their techniques, his solution of mass execution can&#39;t be justified. </p>

<p>If you are into conspiracy theories, a fairly interesting case can be made for Hitler being a Zionist agent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they were are and black people. The Messiah is a black man too. What&#39;s the problem? It&#39;s all there in fine print in the Bible. What would me being a black supremacist have anything to do with the truth?</p>

<p>You sound really suspect to be honest.</p>

<p>If tomorrow all newspapers printed Bruce Lee as a white man, wouldn&#39;t you find that blasphemous? If tomorrow Vladimir Klitschko was portrayed for whatever fucked up reason as a black man with 4 inch Afro, wouldn&#39;t you find it slightly odd? Or would you stay quite like a little effeminate bitch?</p>

<p>Description of the tribe of Judah: </p>

<p>Jeremiah 14:2King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>2 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; </p>

<p>See what colour they are? Black</p>

<p>How does the Hebrew Israelite King Solomon describe himself?</p>

<p>Song of Solomon 1:5-6King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>

<p>Yep. He&#39;s black too. 99% of the people in the bible are black. So what&#39;s the problem?</p>

<p>Only black people believe that, you can do 23 and me and get a genetic test.  God&#39;s people were brown, not black smh... Pulling verses WAY out of context is a very common strategy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>White people do have a genetic disorder though. It&#39;s called &quot;lack of melanin&quot;. Which race of people was suncream was invented for? The white race...if putting on a specific sun cream every day in order to survive the everyday beams of the Sun Isn&#39;t a genetic disorder...then I don&#39;t know what to tell you man.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, The God of Israel hates Esau, the father of the Edomite nation. Esau&#39; s name means; he whose skin is wasted away. Hence the suntan lotion. Nothing taken out of context because the Almighty God of Israel doesn&#39;t lie.</p>

<p>And yes they were obviously brown and all shades of brown people in the 12 tribes of Israel. God&#39;s chosen people. God&#39;s special people. I use the term black because that&#39;s how the world ignorantly refers to people of colour. And yes the Messiah is a black man too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you are right about many things. I have heard all the Esau information before except that you say it means &quot;he whose skin wasted away&quot; and I would like a reference for that. I never heard that before. </p>
