Each age is approximately 2,000 years. This Aquarian age is one of awakenings. People are waking up to the truth and seeing the corruption in the world. I think it spells the end for the Evil people, but not us.</p>

<p>While people are awakening en masse to the corruption of the world they once again are putting their faith in other humans and being led astray by &quot;love&quot;. Instead of looking inside themselves. </p>

<p>Think about that. People are realizing we are killing the earth so they want to leave. People are realizing that people are evil and money is so they turn around and give money to ones who promote &quot;love&quot;...</p>

<p>So while there is an awakening I think we are about to witness an event that will fool even the elect. People are still looking for a world king to come save them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is wise.  But to make things difficult, you have an enemy that is fluent in the word of God and uses it against people.</p>

<p>Also what makes me nervous is how the Bible talks of the radiant light of God; yet also describes Lucifer as &#39;light bearer&#39;.  So in this instance there is an opportunity for evil to sway good people pretending that he is not the enemy.  </p>

<p>Another fear would be if evil pretended to rapture people.  People would easily bow to a light bearing entity that just told them they&#39;ve been raptured for being so good.</p>
