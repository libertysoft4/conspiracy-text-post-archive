<p>All he did was fill it with creatures from the black lagoon. Goldman Sachs, former Rothschild banker (Wilbur Ross), Betsy Devos? Doesn&#39;t her husband have fucking Dyncorp connections?!</p>

<p>Also the dude met with Henry Kssinger and spoke highly of him! He also said he was with the CIA 1,000%. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lDOWcAg8hWk">https://youtu.be/lDOWcAg8hWk</a></p>

<p>You people who support him can&#39;t honestly think he&#39;s going to help us right? </p>

<p>Not to touch on the &quot;pizza&quot; subject, but Donny T is no Prince Charming...his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and his demeanor regarding young girls tell me this dude is at least &quot;aware&quot; of the nefarious sexual stuff that people of his status dabble in and get away with. </p>

<p>You know what. I realize now that it was all
A big fucking show. They &quot;selected&quot; this douchebag to beat Hillary, because they knew we were <em>all</em> expecting her to win...</p>

<p>They bamboozled us and flipped the script, to make him look like a hero. But he&#39;s no fucking different than her. He&#39;s going to be a much more effective puppet than she could have been because he can work the people with his bullshit artistry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all a show.</p>

<p>Obamacare= Romneycare= Heritage Foundation think tank recommended policy, to combat US citizens from realizing that single payer is better throughout every other first world industrial country in the world, and is better and cheaper, especially in the long run.  What we have instead, is a gift to the healthcare system by providing citizens a minimum of what they expect in care and services, huge increases in Rx drugs with no cost limits... it was all a sham.  The GOP secretly love our system.  Anyway, this is the way I see what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have had the top comment years ago.</p>

<p>Nail on the fucking head.  Haven&#39;t voted since the first time I voted in my life (at 21) which was for Obama&#39;s first term.  A year later I realized he had conned me... never again.</p>

<p>Dems are full of shit, repubs are full of shit.  The entire system is inherently corrupt. It&#39;s like playing a game of monopoly, but all the other players start out with a million bucks and you get that starting thousand.  And then on your first roll, the dice are smeared with shit.</p>

<p>Yes, this is <em>the</em> conspiracy forum, where people discuss conspiracies and usually provide <em>evidence</em> in support of those theories. Something you seem to be incapable of doing.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see you prove that the electoral system is rigged. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re sitting on hard evidence of this, information such as that would be highly valuable and important to a lot of people. Maybe it&#39;s because you can&#39;t prove it. Maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re full of it.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a place where you can throw out wild claims and then look down on those who challenge you while you provide zero evidence. That&#39;s <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a></p>

<p>Those who control the flow of money are the ones who influence, and in many cases actually draft legislature to benefit themselves at the cost of everyday people like you and me. They take advantage if the fact that presidential campaigns get more and more expensive each election cycle. Nobody gets elected without owing big favors to very powerful people. This is the reason Trump/Obama/Bush seemed to do a 180 after they were elected. It&#39;s because they had to go against their moral scruples because, well, they owed somebody. They were put in office due to favors, and they will inevitably have to repay said favors. Do you think that these corporations are dumping millions and millions of dollars into presidential campaigns because they want to &quot;make America great again?&quot; No, they&#39;re investing in favors. </p>

The status quo will continue because people are now being conditioned more than ever to worship the state.  Suck on that government titty for your shitty UBI, depend on their generosity with your socialized health care, eat their subsidized GMO food, work as a drone writing parking tickets, take your holidays in Vegas, and die at 60 due to a heart attack.

Tried and true shareblue tactic, anounce your political affiliation then renounce it and try to get others to do the same (through brigading) Then it appears to the average reader that people agree with you and that Trump is losing steam. There is a mutiny afoot and the tides are turning against him. Truth is you better buckle up because just like GWB and Obama, this ride isnt ending for another 7 years. He&#39;s the globalist puppet just like the one that came before him, you bought into the politics and got conned, welcome to the club, its called the &quot;Hey at least its not Hillary&quot; club and I&#39;m the president. </p>

The largest trafficking arrests in US history have happened under Trump.  Not to mention the politically connected who have been arrested on CP charges.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to see your proof that Trump went to pedo-island.  I know they knew each other and ran in some of the same circles but, I&#39;ve never heard the claim that Trump actually went to the island.</p>

<p>I agree with all the other stuff though, the American Dream has become a living nightmare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that the president is not a dictator right?  He can&#39;t just snap his fingers and get done everything he campaigned on.  </p>

<p>I agree, I&#39;m not a fan of some of his cabinet choices (maybe half), but he needs people on the inside to get stuff done.</p>

<p>How can you expect a president to get his agenda through when half of his own party said they would <em>never</em> work with him?  The Russian sanctions bill passed both houses almost unanimously but the Republicans can&#39;t repeal the ACA after bitching about it for 7 years?  Give me a break, they never wanted it repealed because they&#39;re funded by the same.people as the Democrats.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been six months since he took office, that&#39;s twice as long as this BS account you&#39;re using for concern trolling, and he&#39;s already accomplished quite a few things he campaigned on (immigration, trade deals, TPP, Paris Climate Agreement, cracking down on gangs, shrinking the federal government...)</p>
