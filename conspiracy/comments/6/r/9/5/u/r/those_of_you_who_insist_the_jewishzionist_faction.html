    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re correct on many things (the world IS ruled by secret societies, and the Mystery Babylon system is real), but there are more recent events that have transpired that will update your views. The Vatican secret societies were rolled up into Grand Lodge Freemasonry awhile back.</p>

<p>For an example, you can see how the Vatican was working for the CIA during Operation Gladio. The CIA was founded, and continues to be controlled by Grand Lodge Freemasons and Mormons (who were created by Freemasons).</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/_L72CZm4-rU">Michael Tsarion had a great video on the Black Nobility, highly recommend it.</a>  The CIA is not running the world however, they are only one of many spy agencies that report to the Jesuits, who are controlled by the Vatican and the Black Nobility.  Behind the Rothschilds and Rockefellers you find the Houses of Massimo, Breakspeare, Orsini, Bourbon, Windsor-Saxe-Coburg, Pallavincini, Este, Pamphilj, Orange, and several more.  These are the true Bloodline families; they trace their lineage and descendants back centuries, predating Freemasonry and the &quot;Illuminati&quot;, and some of them go even further back into ancient Egypt and possibly Atlantis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I like Michael Tsarion, I&#39;ll check that out.</p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely something to this bloodlines stuff. There&#39;s a guy named Gary Wayne who has some good interviews on ]dragon bloodlines](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOGaMEwH-ts">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOGaMEwH-ts</a>) in China. Many of these elite bloodlines seem to believe they came from the pre-flood <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73J4VSOFn-c">Brotherhood of the Snake</a>, which was a mystery school.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple good links on the Vatican groups and how they were involved with the attempt on Reagan:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes indeed.  They truly believe that they are not of this world, and that their Bloodlines (the Luciferians) are Venusian and Saturnalian in origin.  Several of them have made the claim of being descended from the Atlanteans, who according to the legend destroyed themselves with their own advanced / esoteric technology.  You should also look into The Hidden Hand interview and the Ra Material while you&#39;re at it, some very fascinating looks into the hows and whys of the Elite and possibly why they are here.  Without really delving into the subject matter as much as I could, just be prepared to have your mind blown if you haven&#39;t read into it already :)</p>

<p>It&#39;s because some people, <em>even here</em> are ignorant and bias as fuck, who have not done enough research and know very little about ancient civilizations and history. Rothschilds, for example, are new blood in comparison to some of these much older bloodlines. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve (Rothschild) married in, but just because you marry into a family does not make you the leader/authority of that family, especially with Royal families, there is a power structure already there. Names people do not even know about, are the true controllers. <a href="/u/ahuwahzeus">/u/ahuwahzeus</a> is doing an amazing job of documenting these ancient families and posting them on here.</p>

<p>As for their supposed pre-Adamite origins that predate The Great Deluge, I know that many of them believe it to be true, and if you believe in the legends about Atlantis, it&#39;s more than likely that some of those families survived.  The Law of One/Ra Material and The Hidden Hand interview are pretty convincing accounts that certainly left room for this interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be aware, there&#39;s a LARGE group of shills that pushes Jewish conspiracy theories. Any time this is discussed, the comment section gets botted to hell.</p>

<p>The Jewish being powerful is largely a result of the prohibitions on Christians lending at interest. Jews were the banking families for centuries, so they ended up involved in a lot of high level places. It&#39;s got very little to do with Judaism or ethnic heritage.</p>

<p>There&#39;s good evidence that Grand Lodge Freemasonry is the top of the conspiracy, however you want to call it (the Cult of Saturn, Mystery Babylon, &quot;The Illuminati,&quot; &quot;The NWO,&quot; etc.) </p>

<p><a href="http://avalonlibrary.net/ebooks/John%20Daniel%20-%20Scarlet%20and%20the%20Beast.pdf">Scarlet and the Beast</a> has very good work on how the Grand Lodge rolled up most of the esoteric groups and secret societies from roughly the 1870s to 1950s (including Scientology). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this &quot;Jews rule the world&quot; thing is a psyop to make us look like we&#39;re pointing the finger at ONE ethnic/religious group being responsible for this. That doesn&#39;t make us look good, and gives the MSM ammo against us. </p>

<p>I think they want to make conspiracy theorists look like some kind of anti Jewish lobby. </p>

<p>But none of your recycled counter memes are:</p>

<p>1) true</p>

<p>2) funny enough to be true</p>

<p>3) backed up by enough collective consensus drawn from 109 independent populations for over a thousand years</p>

<p>Better luck next time!</p>
