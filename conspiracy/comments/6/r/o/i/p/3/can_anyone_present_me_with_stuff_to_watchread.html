    <div class="md"><p>you aren&#39;t going to the like the answer but its a simple one. Truth is we do have accounts of major catastrophic events throughout the 18th and 19th century. One proposed theory is that all those cataclysms actually occurred all at once. lotsa people died and anyone writing or documenting the event wouldn&#39;t be documenting it on a global scale only locally. if you read the op i linked to i go into details on how basically upwards of 75 percent of the population was some kinda serf or slave or prisoner  with no education at all. All of a sudden everyone was &quot;free&#39;d&quot; and re educated. these reeducations schools are well documented. look at the art work of Francisco Goya after 1816 look at what he&#39;s documenting. so much mud everywhere. we have to come to terms with the facts that archives have been falsified and there was next to no one around to question it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>theres evidence that there was fighting of some kind. In my opinion its too much to assume we have the full story on who was fighting who and what the true motivations would have been. </p>

<p>you may find it interesting to know that there are 200+ parallels between the the event surrounding the life of napoleon 1 and 3 suggesting that neither of them were who we think they were</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s evidence of a huge conflict across all of europe. So every single person writing at the time and just after wad lying? Have you researched this period for who was fighting who and why?</p>

<p>Also I can&#39;t read russian, Napoleon III probably intentionally tried to make himself like  Napoleon I, just like whenever France had a revolution they put the flags in the same places, raised the barricades in the same position etc</p>

<p>Just like Napoleon crowned himself as Charlemagne did</p>

<p>I cant address your &quot;points&quot; because they are too broad. We need to look at these alleged writings individually and see if our modern interpretation holds up when we consider the new information that this thread is about.</p>

<p>Not only are there 200 plus straight up parallels between these two mens lives  and their so called deeds there are dozens of parallels between the life of napoleon and the myth of Perseus. it&#39;s starting to seem like they are all based on the same basic outline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>again you are asking me if people are lying in some hypothetical writing you would actually have to have the piece of writing in front of us to decide if its credible or if it resembles propaganda. what is propaganda if it&#39;s not state sponsored lying?</p>

<p>a considerable amount of ancient art has been fabricated and we know who was doing it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it defies reason. Your claim that these wars and events were all made up are completely ludicrous. Especially since there is no good reason you&#39;ve provided to explain the coverup</p>

<p>My point also was you were ignoring the fact that there were far more than those states.  That map itself is pretty poor since it ignores Prussia which was far more significant than the US</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you don&#39;t see buried buildings across northern europe. When they made the glass pyramid at the louvre they didn&#39;t uncover pristine rooms that they had no idea were even there? nothing weird about the crumbling buried churches in the middle of siberia with fine brick walls 7 feet thick in regions with no industrial history at all? these churches have no fire place... how they keep warm...Its not weird that at some point in the 19th century just about every city even those that were majority stone buildings burned to the ground or experienced some other catastrophe and had to be re built?</p>
