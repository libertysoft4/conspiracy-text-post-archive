<p>I Frequent T_D almost every day. It&#39;s not because im a major trump supporter but moreso because i like to observe people.</p>

<p>T_D Users merging into Conspiracy was a natural thing that was always bound to happen. </p>

<p>think about it....in Conspiracy most posts are just that....conspiracies!</p>

<ul>
<li>usually they have little to no evidence, sourced using some kind of &quot;technique&quot; by the OP</li>
<li>OP who is usually role playing, has already made up his mind on a conclusion and is now simply looking for any and everything to confirm his own preconceived notion</li>
</ul>

<p>sound familiar?</p>

<p>It&#39;s exactly what T_D does!</p>

<p>most T_D users are trump fans with a very strong preconceived notion that Trump is infallible and god-like, while every other politician is &quot;deep state&quot;  and Democrats are literally monsters who rape and consume children for food</p>

<p>T_D users and &quot;some&quot; conspiracy users literally come up with and share their theories the exact same way....its a natural match made in heaven for T_D users to feel comfortable on this sub.</p>

<p>Most &quot;left-wing&quot; conspiracies ive seen posted here usually dont fit the format....they are usually direct quotes that can be confirmed or even watched on video, it doesnt have the more vague and loose role playing feel the right wing conspiracies have....and thats why they dont get upvoted as much unless its from outside this subreddit</p>

<p>i dunno....just a theory</p>

<p>most the posts nowadays arent just conspiracies....they are right wing conspiracies</p>

<p>i literally saw a post in the_donald....posted word for word here in conspiracy...same thumbnail...different user</p>

<p>he just reposted it here and made top spot</p>

<p>and its easy to see why....like i said in my post above</p>

<p>unsubstantiated claims run high in T_D  and mix well in conspiracy</p>

<p>Almost all US conspiracies of the last 70 years have been deployed by the globalists. </p>

<p>Republican, Democrat, all BS. Either you&#39;re a globalist or anti-globalist. </p>

<p>Trump is anti-globalist, he loves this country. I suspect many of those here in r/conspiracy do, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to ignore the contradictions I&#39;ve presented and feed me the exact new government&#39;s line on everything, well I guess that&#39;s your prerogative. I do know all of those things were already happening prior to his presidency, the growth rate is average, consistent with Obama, illegal immigration was already reducing since the &#39;08 crash, health care was already blowing up in a rather obvious fashion. Any new president will simply take credit for the present and ignore the context that led to it. I&#39;m not one of those guys who think he&#39;s Hitler or a real fascist, but his DOJ is actively doing damage to the rights of people and the press, militarizing and giving more authority to cops, aiming to further suppress voting, all things I knew were on the horizon and I wasn&#39;t willing to trade for the promise of economic boom mass deregulation always promises.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats a really stark choice</p>

<p>what if....</p>

<p>i want a country that values scientists and experts above the opinions of common people who &quot;googled&quot;</p>

<p>what if i want a country that doesnt allow the &quot;Free Market&quot; to do whatever it wants to the environment and pay its workers as little as possible while entrusting obscene amounts to one or two people at the top of the pyramid</p>

<p>what if i realize minorities are treated worse in this country and it didnt end when lincoln freed the slaves....so maybe a focus on improving their lives is needed as much (if not more) than the people who are naturally slightly better of than them due to being in the majority ethnic group?</p>

<p>what if i want a leader who speaks better than me, has more patience and tolerance than i do....and doesnt beg the mexican president to not embarass him by telling the truth about not paying for a wall</p>

<p>theres so many more choices than the two you painted....</p>

<p>furthermore....we live in a global economy...part of my workforce is in siberia and the Philippines....you&#39;re fighting a losing battle</p>

<p>as technology and transportation improves....the world gets smaller...that should be fucking obvious ...even to you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it may be simpler than that. The Russia story is mainstream news, not really a conspiracy. While Seth Rich still isn&#39;t really being covered. That&#39;s just two examples. </p>

<p>So Seth Rich can&#39;t get discussed in places like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> while the Russian story can. That leaves this as one of the only places on Reddit that isn&#39;t totally partisan to talk about Seth Rich. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree that&#39;s a small part of it.  But there&#39;s also a theory (and ample evidence) the alt-right is pushing the Seth Rich/Pizzagate theories as a distraction (which brings the alt-right here en masse).  Pizzagate melted down into absurdity with enough scrutiny, but I admittedly haven&#39;t been closely following the Seth Rich theory, it&#39;s just too convoluted for me.</p>

<p>But yeah, I&#39;d agree with your observation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but is it not that?</p>

<p>most the posts nowadays arent just conspiracies....they are right wing conspiracies</p>

<p>i literally saw a post in the_donald....posted word for word here in conspiracy...same thumbnail...different user</p>

<p>he just reposted it here and made top spot</p>

<p>and its easy to see why....like i said in my post above</p>

<p>unsubstantiated claims run high in T_D  and mix well in conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s as simple as this:</p>

<p>Almost all US conspiracies of the last 70 years have been deployed by the globalists. </p>

<p>They have a firm grip on the left and are moving on Republicunts too. </p>

<p>Republican, Democrat, all BS. Either you&#39;re a globalist or anti-globalist. </p>

<p>Trump is anti-globalist, he loves this country. I suspect many of those here in r/conspiracy do, too. </p>

<p>Either you love America, freedom, democracy, mutual wealth, the American dream, the middle class and free markets, or you hate humanity, want slaves, despise families and home ownership, and desperately want tyrants governing your every move. </p>
