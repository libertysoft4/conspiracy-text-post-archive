<p>&quot;It is time to take action again! It is time to take the destiny of our world in our own hands! We all agree that the process of planetary liberation is taking too long. Here is our chance to collectively speed up the process. Therefore we are using the opportunity of the Solar eclipse on August 21st to create a portal through which we will unify our consciousness and enlighten the energy field around the planet.</p>

<p>Make this viral! Share it worldwide! Please post it on your websites and blogs. Invite spiritual groups to join us. If you know an alternative media outlet, you can send it to them. You can create a Facebook group for your local group of people doing this in your part of the world. We also need one main Facebook group for this event. You can create a video about this and post it on Youtube.</p>

<p>Scientific studies have confirmed positive effects of mass meditations on human society, so each of you that will participate in this meditation can actually help bringing the Event and Full Disclosure closer to us:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.worldpeacegroup.org/washington_crime_study.html">http://www.worldpeacegroup.org/washington_crime_study.html</a></p>

<p>This meditation helps the Light forces to ground the energy of Light on the surface of the planet to strengthen the Light grid which is needed to speed up the process of Full Disclosure and Ascension. Number of people doing that meditation is the single most influential factor within the power of the surface human population for speeding up the process.</p>

<p>We can reach the critical mass of 144,000 people doing this meditation! This will create a massive healing chain reaction in the energy field worldwide. The focus will be on the United States, where much healing is needed.</p>

<p>Astrological chart for our meditation shows a powerful grand trine between Galactic center / Saturn / Lilith in Sagittarius, Eris / Uranus in Aries and Mars / Lunar Node / Sun / Moon in Leo. The core of this grand trine is exact grand trine of Galactic Center at 28 degrees Sagittarius, Uranus at 28 degrees Aries and Sun / Moon eclipse at 28 degrees Leo. At the eclipse, the energy of electric fire of liberation will flow from the Galactic Center (the Pleroma) throughout the Solar System and will be channeled through Uranus and through the Sun / Moon eclipse, all of them located in fire zodiacal signs. Therefore our meditation at the moment of the eclipse has a potential for a huge breakthrough on the planetary surface, as it is a moment of the most direct connection with the Galactic Center.</p>

Once that happens the archons grip on humanity will be lost and we will emerge in a golden age. So yes mediation can absolutely help the world. I don&#39;t expect you to buy any of this though.

<p>Just because you don&#39;t know how it works doesn&#39;t mean its mumbo jumbo. Carl Jung called the shared consciousness the &quot;Collective Subconscious&quot;. Mediation alone works wonders and group meditation works even grander wonders because not only is the mediator optimizing his own mind, the masses are optimizes the collective subconscious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you just meditate for 5 minutes a day for the next 3 weeks so you can feel the miraculous affects for your own self? </p>

<p>Now, imagine if your mind is simply a node on the collective subconscious field. Your well being will affect the well being of all the others that are on that same field which include every single human. </p>

<p>I used to think meditation was mumbo jumbo myself but I just recently started doing it for 2-3 minutes a day and HOLY SHIT! Mediation is a mighty human power that should be used for the sake of our own well being. Think about that. Imagine that we have the power to bring peace to our own minds, increase our intelligence and improve our mental poise by simply meditating for 2-3 minutes a day. Also, light exercise is meditation of the body so when the 2 are combined, they have a nice combo affect.  There are many other benefits too. Peace, mental stability, calmness, stimulation, sharpness, and all the other good feelings are manifested with regular meditation. I&#39;d say these things would probably start popping up fast after 2 weeks of 2-3 minute daily sessions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do mediate, not daily, but several time weekly.  I <em>should</em> do it more.  I never said that meditation wasn&#39;t good for anyone, don&#39;t get me wrong.  It&#39;s great for yourself and there&#39;s toooons of science behind it.  Lowers blood pressure, ups relaxation, reduces stress, etc etc.</p>

<p>But to say that getting together as a group and meditating will reduce the number of violent crimes on the other side of the planet?  Sorry, no.  That&#39;s not a fact and there&#39;s no real science behind it.</p>

<p>If <em>everyone</em> on the planet took the time to relax and meditate every day would crime go down?  Maybe?  Probably?  Would it be because of individuals reducing stress and anxiety?  Yes.  Would it be because everyone is harmonizing their crystal fifth dimensional energy vibrations and raising their minds to the light?  No, that&#39;s shit.</p>

<p>Hmmm..no. We&#39;ve lost enough in this world. I still have not gotten an answer no matter how many times i&#39;ve asked others &quot;what is the destination of &#39;progress&#39;?&quot; I&#39;ve seen enough. We&#39;ve let things progress and progress. Don&#39;t ask me to be part of getting to that destination. I can now clearly see it on the horizon.</p>

<p>Many are &quot;waking up&quot;, others are just being &quot;illuminated&quot;. Not the same.</p>

<p>Evolution.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t we supposed to be evolving? As of now the human species (imho) is going insane. We haven&#39;t leaned how to coexist with <em>each other</em> on this planet. </p>

<p>Wake up to what exactly?</p>

<p>&quot;So many people&quot;, where did you get the numbers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 2 most important things are the individual and the planet as a whole. You can&#39;t just ignore the planet which is the massive group of all of us. We have to care about both equally. </p>

<p>The problem comes with people start dicing up the planet into smaller and smaller groups. Some people only care about their race, some only care about their family, some only care about their dog, some only care about themselves, ect.. That&#39;s why this world is in the mess in the first place. The only thing this world is missing is Unity. Unity = MASSIVE POWER to build a WEALTHY PLANET. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean &quot;care about the planet&quot;? Do you mean the world of people or the actual planet? </p>

<p>Thinking for ourselves is not the antithesis of caring about others. It&#39;s just the opposite. Standing for individual freedoms depends on it.</p>

<p>We need unity under what? There is something and the top of this hypothetical structure you&#39;re speaking of deciding what &quot;unity&quot; ought to believe and agree on.</p>

<p>All of it, the people and everything in the planet. We can actually think of ourselves as the planet instead of a separated individual. </p>

<p>But here is my problem. I am not part of a hivemind planet. I am an individual. I wish to remain an individual, and i&#39;d like individual rights to be highly important in the future of this world.</p>

<p>What should we all, in unity, agree on? What if we don&#39;t? Who is doing the deciding what the &quot;collective&quot; is going to get on board with?</p>
