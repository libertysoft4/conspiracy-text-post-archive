I expected it would be, but since it didn&#39;t break any of their rules in the sidebar, I was wondering how they were going to spin this one.</p>

<p>It seems that now, after years of having to invent reasons to remove posts and in the process show their bias, they have now figured out a way to create the safest of spaces, simply create a list of sources that are allowed and ban everything else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so incredibly sad to see people point to a completely controlled North Korean population, while witnessing people asking for their own censorship in the free West. As if we&#39;re all kids that need to be protected from hearing things that might be damaging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you need to look further, r/politics doesn&#39;t exist in isolation. It isn&#39;t about their ruleset but about the mentality that can exist in a so called free society. It isn&#39;t about the mods who rule over its visitors but about the users who are happy about it, they exist outside that sub, they are everywhere around you, if these people are not your target then who are we spreading information for, our own indulgence? Beating our own chest because we know better? I can be cynical too but I prefer to overlook that in favor of some pragmatism.</p>

<p>And what makes you think that would happen???</p>

<p>Without the mandate, many healthy people are expected to drop coverage. People making these arguments are gaslighting the fact that Obamacare didn&#39;t exist before 2010 and the world was not in chaos before then.  This whole idea that the sky would fall if we went back to pre-2010 healthcare is a farce. </p>

<p>Then go donate some fucking money to a charity, if you&#39;re such a good person, instead of insisting that the government steal more of my hard-earned money without my consent to pay for healthcare. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not against poor people getting free healthcare, I&#39;m against the government taking my money without my consent. Maybe if I wasn&#39;t getting taxed out the ass so hard I could afford to donate to a charitable institution once in a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait a minute. Are you seriously trying to say that a gold-standard source of unbiased political news like r-&quot;politics&quot; is... not that?</p>

<p>It is literally named politics and literally nobody was around when it switched overnight from a Bernie Sanders leaning subreddit into Hillary Clinton&#39;s (who I still honorably refer to as Madame President) personal rally center! And since nobody was there and you cannot prove it, then it is obvious you are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>literally trying to turn this subreddit into a clone of t_d</p></li>
<li><p>officially disrespecting my <em>fellow conspiracy members</em> who all find r-politics to be an amazing source of genuine journalism</p></li>
<li><p>literally getting paid by the Russians/Chinese/North Koreans to make these posts</p></li>
<li><p>seriously disrespecting the integrity of reddit, reddits popular page, and the #1 unbiased source of politics on the internet which r-conspiracy could learn a thing or two from.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, when this subreddit perfectly resembles r-politics, only then will we know that we have beaten those evil TD&#39;ers whose only goal in life is to manipulate this subreddit.</p>

<p>Only when every comment section is a graveyard for any dissenting opinions to the MSM, will we know that we have finally won that battle!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got the reason why that link isn&#39;t allowed, and yet for some reason decided it was because of something else.
This isn&#39;t to do with the whitelist they recently implemented, this is because your linked website isn&#39;t ran by a news org.</p>

<p>Frankly your comment is a bit brainless because it seemingly fails to see the issue I&#39;m addressing and instead goes on about how they&#39;re technically in the right. You know, it isn&#39;t hard to be technically in the right when you can decide what the rules are, the discussion is whether those rules are just.

<p>It is an unacceptable source according to their rules and there is a link to the rules in the sidebar. The guidelines in the sidebar are a summery of the rules, which is why not every rule is quoted in the sidebar (their rule list is far too long to fully include in the sidebar). Again, this has nothing to do with the whitelist but to do with the fact the source is not affiliated with a news org. </p>

<p>If the removal of your submission is irrelevant, why include it here in this submission? If the removal of your submission has nothing to do with the whitelist, that means you either thought it did and don&#39;t want to admit you were wrong or you included it knowing it was irrelevant to the discussion you apparently want as a means to back up your viewpoint. The former makes you look like an idiot, the latter makes you look like you intended to misrepresent the situation.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s examine that for a moment! Your post was...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I reposted an article by Pilger about the US / Russia / China situation and it got promptly removed because &#39;unacceptable source&#39;. I expected it would be, but since it didn&#39;t break any of their rules in the sidebar, I was wondering how they were going to spin this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm. Interesting. The first <strong>third</strong> of your post mentions nothing about the whitelist at all! It is all about being removed for being an unacceptable source and how it didn&#39;t break any rules on the sidebar, which it quite obviously does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems that now, after years of having to invent reasons to remove posts and in the process show their bias, they have now figured out a way to create the safest of spaces, simply create a list of sources that are allowed and ban everything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also interesting. In the second <strong>third</strong> of your post you only obliquely mention the whitelist, and still complain about reasons being &#39;invented&#39; to remove posts- another direct reference to your own post being removed for &#39;invented&#39; reasons (which, as we have established, were in no way invented).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s so incredibly sad to see people point to a completely controlled North Korean population, while witnessing people asking for their own censorship in the free West. As if we&#39;re all kids that need to be protected from hearing things that might be damaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last <strong>third</strong> of your post again does not directly reference the whitelist. Instead it makes a comment hyperbolic about censorship (which is now completely unsubstantiated) and says they are protecting people from content you... freely admit might be damaging.</p>

<p>Sure seems like your post was more about your post getting removed than about the whitelist!</p>

<p>So you are complaining because the post you want to put up, which has always been against the rules, will now be automatically barred instead of requiring a moderator to manually remove it for... still breaking the rules?</p>

<p>Is another definition of retrograde. Limiting sources of info, in light of the internet&#39;s ability to allow a cornucopia of sources. BAR is a radical leftist blog owned and operated by African-Americans that is highly influential in circles of leftist and radical thinking.</p>

<p>Regardless, this retrograde rule is an acknowledgement that the founding democratic principles underlying reddit need not apply to r/politics, which is why their blacklist and elimination of self-posts is frankly disgusting (and retrograde).

<p>Have you tried messaging the moderators and making that case? If it is influential then make the case for it, don&#39;t just bemoan that they aren&#39;t already aware of it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How so? I have seen many people complain about the trash in /new... far more than I have seen bemoaning the changes. That would seem to me to actually be living up to the democratic principles of reddit- the majority wants some low bars of entry for sources, so it gets implemented. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is why their blacklist and elimination of self-posts is frankly disgusting (and retrograde). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you should remind yourself of the stated purpose of r/politics. Allow me to remind you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a> is the subreddit for current and explicitly political U.S. news.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key word in that is NEWS. Not opinion. Not thought. NEWS. How are self-posts in any way necessary to providing NEWS?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that you car because you are terribly interested in defending their rules while not questioning why those rules are even necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you taking the position that rules regarding veracity and notability of a source are not necessary? That, say, the things floating around facebook should qualify as news, even if they are verifiably false? </p>

<p>No, I just don&#39;t care. I&#39;m slowly weaning myself off of reddit and tech in general, mainly because I don&#39;t think we have much time left as a species (a few decades) and I&#39;m tired of wasting my time with people like yourself who are self-righteous twits bent on ignoring the fucked up nature of reality online and off. So keep defending that social consensus, and make sure those you support politically, will soon rule over ash.</p>

<p>I mean it is bothersome that their posts are literally constantly on r/all and on r/popular (to beautifully mislead and brainwash unsuspecting visitors and even regular Redditors that don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s going on), but it&#39;s probably impossible to fight it at this point. </p>

<p>Making and promoting other high quality subs, as well as making this sub one of a higher quality is probably where our efforts should be aimed at (instead of fighting them - though to be fair, a post here and there bringing awareness to the obvious one-sided insanity that is r/politics is still perhaps at times a good idea).</p>
