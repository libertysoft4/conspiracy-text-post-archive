    <div class="md"><p>First, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j5ybwes0&amp;amp;sh=746186d7">shills exist and there are a huge number of entities that hire them.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Link ONE shill comment. Just one </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, failure to provide this doesn&#39;t prove anything. The argument is going to be &quot;but you can&#39;t prove those people are shills.&quot; That is the very reason shills exist. It&#39;s actually really difficult to leave evidence behind proving that you are a shill, so even the sloppy ones usually don&#39;t leave proof. </p>

<p>We are left with the corporations that have been caught doing it, news reports on government shills that don&#39;t name specific usernames, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5pzcnx/shill_confessions_and_additional_information/?st=izz0ga8r&amp;amp;sh=43621acd">former shills that have admitted to it</a> (a portion of which could be making it up, or they are blocked from revealing too much because of NDA&#39;s), and the select few times some account was outright caught shilling. I&#39;m aware of 4 or 5 of those, including some hot sauce company that always used the same accounts to defend the owner and a few CTR accounts, but the threads with proof are always deleted by the user or removed. That is some really bad luck. In short, you won&#39;t get any accounts specifically named and proven to be shills because of 1) bad luck I guess (or paid off, etc) and 2) you&#39;d have to be absurdly sloppy to leave proof behind. Most people will always give the benefit of the doubt, so the practice of shilling really is the perfect PR professional&#39;s wet dream. It&#39;s easy and very low risk. We know shilling is widespread by the first link I cited, but narrowing it down to specific accounts is usually not going to happen.  </p>

<p>An Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trolls and shills will go where the traffic is. If that sub gets bigger, it will suffer the same fate. You have to ask yourself how you would run a shilling organization. Regular people have easy access to keyword alert services. Shills will certainly use this, along with some kind of queue that ranks the targeted posts by how much traffic is there at that moment. This can either be automated or done manually. Say there are 2 posts on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> that have to deal with shady business practices of Corporation X. Corporation X&#39;s shill  team will get alerts for these two posts (along with many others), but those two will be first in the queue. Once they are done there, the next most popular post that mentions X will be invaded and so on and so forth until they have exhausted their 8 or 10 hour shift. If your sub mentions X and there are no more posts above it in the queue during the shift, the thread will be invaded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to disagree to some extent.  It&#39;s unlikely that a banned shill account can be prevented from vote-brigading, but if the mods were to ban a shill account, at least the shill account would be prevented from forum-sliding, calling us &quot;conspiracy theorist nutjobs&quot; and the like, which may have saved this sub had it been carried out at an earlier time.

<p>Shills try very hard to fit into communities, so for the most part, you will not be able to tell who is the shill and who is not. Subtle manipulation and misdirection is key. You will end up in a state of paranoia where you ban everyone with a dissenting opinion or who occasionally goes off on a tangent accidentally. This will cause a lot of division within the community, which is the very thing shills want. It&#39;s better to play it safe and have somewhat specific rules that are easily enforced. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Shills will also use this rule  against the users. They might fabricate evidence that you are a shill, which happened to me. They can follow you around and call you a shill, call you an anti vaxer, anti GMO nut, etc (also happened to me). It&#39;s a good rule, but it obviously has to be enforced properly. </p>

<p>I have seen a lot of comments removed if they are making fun of users in this sub. It probably (heavily) depends on how many reports a comment is getting. This is a huge sub and the task of micro-moderating the comments in every thread must be a ton of work. Even just the top 5 can be a lot of work because you have to keep checking back to each thread over the course of its life to see any new comments that break rules. </p>

<p>I mod a small 20,000 subscriber sub and the mod queue can get backed up pretty bad depending on how much time I get each day. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, so if you have a bunch of trolls who are flooding the mods with removal requests, those are the comments that will get removed. If you see rule violations, send the mods a modmail with a link, or just report it. You have to ask them if they regularly check the reports or not, which doesn&#39;t give notifications, but modmail will always give them a notification. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. Sooooo true. Good post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been explaining some of the shilling tactics to my father in an attempt to have him understand why Trump and Clinton are in the news cycles so often and why it seems like both are under attack 24/7. Baby boomers don&#39;t go on forums like the under 50 crowd does. They are spoonfed their news.</p>

<p>We are not. We seek it out. And now our way of discussing news and sharing information is being poisoned by CTR/SB and Cambridge. It&#39;s making it so toxic that nobody even wants to share information now. This whole subreddit has become extremely toxic like a MOBA game. There is little discussion.</p>

<p>And as you said, for our children this is the WORST possible outcome of the internet. This is exactly opposite what the internet was for us. I don&#39;t know about you, but I did not even know what an atheist was until I started reading on the net when I was 8 and my dad got 33.3 dialup for his job. It opened a whole new world, as they say.</p>

<p>And I say all this as someone who tends to believe that Trump had contacts with Russia, and that CA is doing a number on this sub. But so is CTR. So is the FBI/NSA/DoD/CIA/whatever. They&#39;re all doing it.</p>

<p>And like you said, it&#39;s killed discussions in so many ways. I suppose that is the point.</p>

<p>Poison the fucking well. I would welcome contest mode on all posts over 100 comments. At least this would FORCE people to confront opinions and posts they don&#39;t like, and would foster much more discussion than what we get on this sub.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post.</p>

<p>I remember Obama kicking out more than anyone else while also allowing people to come in easier so we can at least document the people who would come regardless.</p>

<p>when half of NY is supposed to be underwater in 5 years according to Al Gore</p>

<p>Al Gore is a politician and climate change is real, he just tried to scare people into caring.</p>

<p>No one said it is right, its necessary for society and even you say its still developing and not complete.</p>

<p>when you believe socialism is amazing while ignoring every single country using the system has failed</p>

<p>Socialism is the most effective system we have found for Healthcare, medicare works, social security works, NHS works, no one is arguing for socialism, just socialized medicine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and when you believe GMOs aren&#39;t used to produce larger yields and healthier crops but are instead being used to give people cancer...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t a belief of the left when did Hillary say she wanted to end the use of GMOs</p>

<p>Okay now its my turn</p>

<p>GOP hates the free market, wants to tariff and tax imports</p>

<p>Gop hates economics and wants to reintroduce failed supply side policies</p>

<p>GOP hates personal freedom and wants to blanket ban groups from military</p>

<p>GOP thinks judges cannot rule on cases based on their race</p>

<p>GOP want to build an entirely useless wall on our dime because they don&#39;t understand how illegal immigration works</p>

<p>By lumping us into one belief and one group is a means to discredit us. Because now, they no longer have to wait for a &quot;stupid&quot; conspiracy to emerge to make fun of conspiracy theorists, they just have to make up their own stupid conspiracy, and peddle around that every conspiracy theorist believes this, and so now anything, that someone who believes in a conspiracy, says is invalidated and most likely false in the eyes of a shallow mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, give me your facts as to how a building falls at free-fall speeds, and collapses evenly into it&#39;s own footprint without removing any and all resistance?</p>

<p>Also, give me your facts as to why the only time in history a skyscraper was utterly demolished because of &quot;fire&quot; was on that day.  Why have larger, hotter fires burned for longer periods of time than on 9/11 with little to no structural failure, let alone complete collapse.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see your &quot;facts.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>Notice how on every post about Hillary/Obama/Sanders/CNN/The left, the top comments are always bashing OP and this sub.</p>

<p>Yet on posts about Trump/Bush/The right, the top comments are always organically discussing the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Pretty obvious to tell.</p>

<p>Even the top comment in here is from someone that posts daily in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> yet has to seed the idea that CTR/Shareblue shills don&#39;t exist, and it&#39;s &quot;unpopular&quot; to call someone one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has always had dissenting views highly upvoted in comment threads. It&#39;s one of the reasons I started hanging out here 6-7 years ago.   </p>

<p>A highly upvoted post with an alarmist title would often have a top comment debunking the title or adding important context to the article. It was one of the things that made me think, &quot;Wow, people on reddit actually think for themselves.&quot; There was a common joke about how people always checked the comments first to make sure the post wasn&#39;t BS.     </p>

<p>This was back when Ron Paul, privacy, and tech news were the most popular topics on this site.  </p>

<p>That sort of thing has gone away on large subs where memes/jokes/puns are now the most upvoted comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an honest assessment.</p>

<p>Currently, there&#39;s an enormous conspiracy/scandal going on in U.S. politics. Whether you think it&#39;s all fake or not doesn&#39;t matter--it&#39;s big enough to frequently dominate the media and millions of Americans are interested in it.</p>

<p>A lot of those people use Reddit. And now that a conspiracy is front-and-center, a lot of those people are going to be curious about what the main conspiracy hub is saying about it. Imagine the users of <a href="/r/linkinpark">/r/linkinpark</a> complaining about brigaders the day Chester Bennington died.</p>

<p>So, yes, you have an influx of liberal visitors to your sub. I&#39;m one of them. Nobody is paying me, I&#39;m just interested in the Russia scandal and I&#39;m interested to see what this sub&#39;s take is on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...? Are you serious? </p>

<p>Honestly, how long have you been on this sub? This sub&#39;s past-time has always been insulting other users. It&#39;s just the nature of the sub. </p>

<p>People come here and present theories and information that is EXTREMELY controversial. Oftentimes it&#39;s not vetted. Unsubstantiated. Not saying it&#39;s a bad thing, it&#39;s a freaking conspiracy sub. If it were vetted and meticulously substantiated, it would be a pretty shitty conspiracy. </p>

<p>But, as it always goes, whenever anyone presents material like that, some people are going to balk, others are going to laugh, others are going to poke holes and shoot it down. That is the nature of conspiracy talk and exchange of these types of ideas. </p>

<p>Now, on the internet of all places, people don&#39;t take too kindly to being ridiculed, laughed at or challenged. So the go to thing? Insult back. &quot;Shill&quot; accusations have been on this sub since I was fresh on Reddit and stumbled into this sub. Back then, it was JIDF shills and corporate shills from Monsanto and such. That was the go-to accusation. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s Trump shills. Clinton shills (why she would need them, idek) and DNC/Shareblue shills. </p>

<p>And then butthurt parties ALWAYS blasted self-posts about &quot;how this sub is changing&quot; &quot;how we&#39;ve been compromised&quot; and how &quot;we&#39;re all being duped&quot; by these unseen forces.</p>

<p>The truth is.... it&#39;s usually just a case of massive butthurt because a lot of people who are into conspiracies are also very sensitive, snowflake type people who don&#39;t know how to handle rejection. </p>

<p>Not saying that as an insult. Just the truth. Insults to this sub and its users are old as hell. </p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and you also have the conspiratard types that like to agitate and ridicule as a past-time. Now it&#39;s TMOR and politics people who like to come in and tap on the glass. And, honestly, it IS kind of funny how the sub that loves conspiracies so much is doing <em>so</em> much to stifle and derail conversation about, arguably, one of the biggest scandals in recent history. It&#39;s especially interesting to see the sub that hated government and loved whistleblowers now rally to the side of the fucking federal government like it can do no wrong and it&#39;s just a victim. The love affair stinks to high heaven and it&#39;s amazing people here kinda just look the other way as people are getting banned left and right for stepping out of line and only posts critical of him and the right wing narrative get tagged and put into that ridiculous contest mode. I don&#39;t hate the feature, but it should just be default on for ALL posts and people should be given the option to switch to the other modes as well. </p>

<p>long before my reddit avatar was born, upvotes and downvotes used to be visibly linked to users. Maybe an OGP can chime in here, I&#39;ve been on sites before that did this. You can literally see how the vote tally breaks down and who voted which way. </p>

<p>This would be much better than contest mode imo. I want to see the shilling, I want to unbury the buried comment and see what I&#39;ve long suspected right in my fucking face. This, imo, is the only way to wake people up, the let the proof come to bear. I dunno, maybe I&#39;m jaded. </p>
