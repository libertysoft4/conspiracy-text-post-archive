        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve read a ton of posts lately that literally discredit every possible source of information. Peer reviewed publications, historically respected scientific journals, all of the MSM, etc, etc.</p>

<p>How in the fuck are we supposed to get information then? You&#39;re telling me we can&#39;t trust science journals or peer reviewed publications. Can&#39;t trust mainstream media. Can&#39;t trust the president. Can&#39;t trust foreigners. </p>

<p>Honest to God question. Where do I get my information then? Where do YOU get your information that&#39;s so much better than the media? I&#39;m sure as fuck not capable of going out and doing these scientific measurements and tests and shit. </p>

<p>I feel like most people in this sub have their tin foil hats on a little bit too tight. This sub has almost become a laughable joke to me. You guys distrust everything. I don&#39;t know how you guys can claim to be &quot;woke&quot; when you&#39;ve got no means of gathering information because you&#39;ve shit on it all already and your opinions are formed based on your blind faith that you think something is fishy and take LITERALLY any bread crumb of a lead and beat that horse to death even if there&#39;s nothing to it. You claim anyone that even questions your crumb of information is a shill or a sheep when isn&#39;t it our responsibility to question things?</p>

<p>How do you even consider yourself remotely informed when you&#39;re just another Joe Schmoe like me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a good example of what i mean. </p>

<p>Ive seen this headline a lot lately - &quot;Pro-Trump trolls silent after “alt-right” ship detained in Mediterranean for apparent human trafficking&quot;.</p>

<p>If we look into it we see that it involves a neo-nazi group called &#39;Defend Europe&quot;.  Immediately we can see the problems as the article tries to paint Trump supporters as nazis... yet Trump is a strong supporter of Israel. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no Trump supporter but like anyone else ive seen his support base, neo-nazi they <em>generally</em> are not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much dismiss any headline that says &quot;Pro-Anything trolls/right/left silent/outraged/destroyed after something.&quot; The article outs itself as just driving a narrative with probably poor journalism quality.</p>

<p>About the MSM, I think there is a major problem in that terminology. It groups all the news you don&#39;t like together and uses the transitive property to apply negatives from one to all of them. I believe they each need to be examined on their merits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The overuse of broad, poorly defined labels on all sides is a huge issue today. Whether it&#39;s &quot;liberals&quot;, &quot;conservatives&quot;, &quot;alt-right&quot; (which, as a side note, is mistranslated in many European countries to mean ult-right, or ultra-right, which I think is pretty insidious), even statements here and elsewhere like &quot;the Jews did this&quot;, or &quot;black people do this&quot; and &quot;white people do that&quot;, it&#39;s virtually all bullshit caked around a sliver of truth.</p>

<p>It makes communication between people of different mindsets very tricky, as words begin to mean different things to different people because those labels have been twisted and turned so often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It helps if you understand the structure of propaganda.  Edward Bernays came up with the principle model that is used in the West, not just for media-sponsored propaganda but in particular how to use even honest media to form a false narrative in the general population.</p>

<p>NLP and hypnotherapy techniques are used commonly, and if you understand them then you can quickly find the weak parts of propaganda and you can learn how to ask the right questions to reveal the truth.</p>

<p>Print media is the only information source that most people can analyze closely enough to be able to have a prayer of figuring things out.  TV and radio just moves too fast and there are too many layers of lies and agendas.  Most news articles -- even fake news -- have at least one line of actual information.  Look for it. Usually about 1/2-2/3 through the article. It&#39;s a quote, or some statement of fact which usually negates all the rest of the article. That&#39;s your news.  TV and radio broadcast have these nuggets as well but it goes too fast and the manipulation of your consciousness too complete to hold on to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can be fed all the information in the world, but: </p>

<p>Reality is not what is &quot;real&quot;.  When the realities of two people differ about the same subject, this is when conflict occurs.</p>

<p>What is reality but a concept unique to each of us? Can anything be classed as real when our perceptions differ greatly on so many things? Just because we see something a particular way does not make it so.</p>

<p>Lets take the example of war. There are some people who believe that war is necessary sometimes to get peace and then in order to keep the peace. There are other people who will believe that war is evil and should never be entered into no matter what. Who is right? Is war right or wrong?</p>

<p>reality is a very fluid concept. What you see as real is only defined by your belief structure. Your version of what is real is only your perception of it; not what is so. </p>

<p>There is no such thing as reality. There is only ‘your’ version of it which is essentially your perception. Remember that what you believe to be true is only as true as your worldly experience and it doesn’t go any further than that. Even many scientific theories are just that; they are theories! It doesn’t make them so.</p>

<p>Everyday scientists are making discoveries that are forcing them to throw out the old text books and write new ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My contention is we should spot patterns.  I don&#39;t believe in every conspiracy theory but we have to &quot;connect the dots&quot; if we want to see the bigger picture.  And lots of times you have to separate the static from the noise.  It&#39;s not easy to do.  You can other perspectives from RT, or PressTV, SANA, and there&#39;s a whole list of alternative websites that I like to read.  And after you read that, LOOK to see if what is said is actually what&#39;s happening IRL.  <em>actions SHOULD speak louder than words</em> If the US says that they want to SAVE Libya but they end up destroying Libya; judge it then be seeing with your own eyes what happened IRL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. Quick google leads me to a &#39;yes&#39; conclusion, here&#39;s some context: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am the source for this quote, which was indeed said by CIA Director William Casey at an early February 1981 meeting of the newly elected President Reagan with his new cabinet secretaries to report to him on what they had learned about their agencies in the first couple of weeks of the administration.<br/>
The meeting was in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House, not far from the Cabinet Room.  I was present at the meeting as Assistant to the chief domestic policy adviser to the President.  Casey       first told Reagan that he had been astonished to discover that over               80 percent of the &#39;intelligence&#39; that the analysis side of the CIA produced was based on open public sources like newspapers and magazines.<br/>
As he did to all the other secretaries of their departments and agencies, Reagan asked what he saw as his goal as director for the CIA, to which 
he replied with this quote, which I recorded in my notes of the meeting 
as he said it.  Shortly thereafter I told Senior White House correspondent Sarah McClendon, who was a close friend and colleague, who in turn made it public.  Barbara Honegger  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear Joe Schmoe, 
   Your 1st step is to develop your critical thinking skills. This is IMPORTANT, and it is neither quick nor easy. The fact that you have a desire to seek out the truth is the first hurdle. 
  2nd, this sub is the place to go to AFTER you have developed your critical thinking skills. This sub used to be populated with thinking people who engaged in thought games based on a well rounded base of knowledge - now, it is a shit storm, overflowing with the mentally challenged and shills(political and corporate), with only brief moments of  intellectually rewarding sunshine. Coming here now is like trying to get diet tips at a confectionery shoppe. 
  3rd- It has ALWAYS been difficult to receive the truth from &quot;official&quot; sources. Everyone has an agenda... everyone. 
  Of course if you just want to avoid my suggestions, I understand....
   Read the following-
     The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli - will help you to understand why they lie to you.
     The Peoples History by Howard Zinn- will help you to understand the what and when of the lies<br/>
      <a href="http://projectcensored.org/">http://projectcensored.org/</a> - will help you to understand the who&#39;s and wheres of the present lies. 
 Best of luck,
    Citizen Jetsam</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and a lot of it is just knowing which sources to trust with which topics.  Don&#39;t believe anyone without question, of course.  And always search for multiple sources.  But, for instance, I would trust Infowars to report accurately on a terror attack, over any kind of mainstream media, any day.  I would trust Alex Jones to give truthful commentary on the economic news and the origins and role of the Federal Reserve in the global economic system, because I know that he has deep sources within the gold bug community.  I also tend to believe little intelligence tidbits he throws out from his sources in the deep state, because I know he has them.</p>

<p>I <em>wouldn&#39;t</em>, however, trust anything he says about psychic vampires, because I know his source for that is probably David Icke.  I wouldn&#39;t take anything he says about complex scientific or technological subjects at face value, because I know he just reads the same tech blogs that I do, and doesn&#39;t completely understand all of them.  The same goes for Rush Limbaugh.  He has fairly extensive connections within the more mainstream political establishment, so I would trust what he says about that.  I wouldn&#39;t trust either of them to tell me about UFO sightings.  Maybe something like Coast to Coast AM would be a better source.  Would I trust Veterans Today to tell me what to do about Islamic extremism?  No, of course not.  Those are people who have spent the past fifteen years losing wars.  Most of them thought that 9/11 was real.  I would, however, trust them to tell me the general view of the military towards certain politicians, and how they might react to them.</p>

<p>I might trust mainstream media to tell me the weather.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Information is like putting together a specific puzzle when the pieces of 8 other puzzles are mixed in; analysis and sifting.</p>

<p>Despite Reddit&#39;s egregious bias and often times blatant <del>censorship</del> moderation, there are quite a few pieces relevant to the puzzles of the sociopolitical stage right now. The key thing to be mindful of is allowing your personal views to shape your desired outcome.</p>

<p>If you believe that a conspiracy exists, you will do your best to find one, even to the point that excluding real evidence to the contrary becomes a normal approach for you. It comes from a desire to be right with ourselves and in the sight of others. A good example of this is when you have a million sources that say the sun is yellow and one that says it&#39;s blue. We may think it&#39;s insanity to suggest the sun is blue but this person said it&#39;s blue for a reason. Investigate that reason, determine if there is any measure of reasonable legitimacy that warrant further investigation.</p>

<p>The best and worst sources of information are all sources; its up to you to make the effort to sift through what&#39;s out there, review the evidence, maintain a self-enforced standard of ethical judgment in discerning fact from fiction, and then moving forward to the next piece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a conspiracy sub, it&#39;s in the name. A lot of the conversations we used to have over at politics and other subs have been hijacked, so the non reporting of issues is more of the red flag to me. A lot of information that is news came from leaks, from the likes of Wikileaks. The Podesta emails, should have brought on investigations from every intelligence agency, from pay to pay, collision and sons strange code word mentions, that some say are pedophilia related. Only Hillary Clinton could have gotten away having top secret files on a private home server. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the news sources on this sign as most seem sketchy as shit. The best you can really do is find as many sources with conflicting views and price together your own analysis. </p>

<p>I do think this place is less pro Trump as it is why did nothing come from the contents of the leaks, then where they came from. Julian Assange started the leaks didn&#39;t come from Russia and did come from within the DNC and he put up a reward for Seth Rich, he&#39;s telling us who really leaked the emails. </p>

<p>There is a ton of ton foil hats, but this placed used to be more about 9/11 and UFO&#39;s. The flat earth bullshit is pretty new, but I miss the days when browsing here, was like reading weakly works news at the checkout stand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think a lot of this sub is information based.  I think they have an emotional response based on certain stigmas and biases about specific topics, which lets them shoot from the gut and filter out anything that contradicts their narrative.  </p>

<p>While this is not a logical process, I do think it has potential value.  Long after the reasonable people have moved on, the conspiracists are still digging.  The handful or so who also happen to be skilled researchers might then dig up and expose something of value.</p>

<p>That said, this sub has a chronic clickbait addiction and appears to trust clickbait over mainstream sources, which is silly and dangerous.  You can disagree with the Washington Post&#39;s overall narrative and thus be critical of their conclusions without completely discounting every bit of journalism they&#39;ve ever done, and questioning the basic facts they report, for example.</p>

<p>You also have to accept that a lot of users here come from The_Donald, a cult-like group of Trump supporters who appear to be incapable of believing anything negative about the President and prefer meme spam to actual argument.</p>
