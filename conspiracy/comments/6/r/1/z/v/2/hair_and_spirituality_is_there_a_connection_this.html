<p>I have lived amongst the Navajo reservation for 10 years (or a little more), and one thing that has always stood out to me is the fact that cutting your hair, especially for women, is advised against. The women here have some of the most beautiful, strong, luxurious hair I have ever seen, and many do not cut it, no matter how long it gets. Instead, they wear it in a bun (or in braids), which I think makes it more manageable. Of course, not every Navajo women does this, but it is extremely interesting to me. </p>

<p>In this article, the author notes that <em>hair is memory.</em> She writes,</p>

<p>“I have often heard that, for Navajo people, hair is our memory. Before my traditional Navajo wedding, my long hair (it went down to my waist) was washed with yucca root. It foams up quickly. Afterward, my hair was brushed with a bundle of stiff grass called a be’ezo. I still have that bundle and I occasionally brush my children’s hair with it. The act of caring for the hair, one relative to another, like my grandmother and family did for me, is an expression of love to me. Sharing it with my children feels natural. In fact, I cannot imagine not doing it. I can still hear my mother, my shi má making comments in Navajo as she brushed my hair.”</p>

<p>The other day, I was browsing youtube, and I happened to come across an ad from Dove. In the ad, the women cuts her hair, and she transforms herself. Something did not settle right with me, and I’d like to discuss why.</p>

<p>Here is the ad by the way:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y42U9YocVR0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y42U9YocVR0</a></p>

<p>Was there something more to this? Why are so many women encouraged to cut their hair short, especially in the past few decades? The purpose of this post is to explore this topic, and maybe, make some connections between hair and spirituality.</p>

<p><strong>Women and Hair</strong></p>

<p>I hate doing this to men, but I really cannot relate to their perspective. I do apologize. Earlier I received a message from a good Reddit friend, and she told me she was thinking about hair. She explained (<a href="/u/natasha2827">/u/natasha2827</a>) or pointed out that when she went through a pretty bad time in her life, she cut off a huge chunk of her hair, and she later regretted it. </p>

<p>For women, hair is kind of a big deal, and I know that almost every woman I have ever met <em>hates</em> her natural hairstyle. It is no surprise that many black women experience bias against their natural hair:</p>

<p><a href="https://blackamericaweb.com/2017/02/06/new-study-confirms-bias-toward-black-womens-natural-hair/">https://blackamericaweb.com/2017/02/06/new-study-confirms-bias-toward-black-womens-natural-hair/</a></p>

<p>As for white women, girls with straight hair want their hair curly, and girls with curly hair want their hair straight. As a white girl with naturally blonde curly hair, I always hated it. I was told it looked better straight, and that I needed to control it. I am sure most women have a story about how they were told their hair sucked. In other words, their hair needed to be controlled.
Interestingly enough, after I received the message from Natasha, I went to work to set up my classroom, and I had my hair as natural as could be. It has been extremely humid here, so it was curlier than usual. A little girl I came across said she loved my hair. It made me smile, and I kept thinking more about it.</p>

<p>As I worked, I just kept thinking about hair, and I started to realize their might be a larger conspiracy here. I guess I am the type who thinks there is a conspiracy to everything 😊
I realized at that point that most women have issues with their hair, and more and more seem to be cutting their hair short. Is it just an act of defiance, or is there something deeper there?</p>

<p><strong>Hair and Spirituality</strong></p>

<p>Upon doing some further research, I do think there is a link between hair and spirituality. Of course, these sources may not be the best I have ever found, but it is fascinating!</p>

<p>I have learned a lot about Navajo boarding schools, and one of the first things they did was cut off their students’ hair.
Again, I cannot claim this is the best source in the world, but is interesting nonetheless:</p>

<p>“Long ago people in many cultures didn’t cut their hair, because it was a part of who they were. There were no salons. Often, when people were conquered or enslaved, their hair was cut as a recognized sign of slavery. It was also understood that this would serve as punishment and decrease the power of those enslaved.
The bones in the forehead are porous and function to transmit light to the pineal gland, which affects brain activity, as well as thyroid and sexual hormones. Cutting bangs which cover the forehead impedes this process.
When Genghis Khan conquered China, he considered the Chinese to be a very wise, intelligent people who would not allow themselves to be subjugated. He therefore required all women in the country to cut their hair and wear bangs, because he knew this would serve to keep them timid and more easily controlled.
As whole tribes or societies were conquered, cut hair became so prevalent that the importance of hair was lost after a few generations, and hairstyles and fashion grew to be the focus.
The science of hair was one of the first technologies given by Yogi Bhajan when he came to America.
“When the hair on your head is allowed to attain its full, mature length, then phosphorous, calcium, and vitamin D are all produced, and enter the lymphatic fluid, and eventually the spinal fluid through the two ducts on the top of the brain. This ionic change creates more efficient memory and leads to greater physical energy, improved stamina, and patience.”
Yogi Bhajan explained that if you choose to cut your hair, you not only lose this extra energy and nourishment, but your body must then provide a great amount of vital energy and nutrients to continually re-grow the missing hair.
In addition, hairs are the antennas that gather and channel the sun energy or prana to the frontal lobes, the part of the brain you use for meditation and visualization. These antennas act as conduits to bring you greater quantities of subtle, cosmic energy. It takes approximately three years from the last time your hair was cut for new antennas to form at the tips of the hair.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantumbalancing.com/spiritualhair.htm">https://www.quantumbalancing.com/spiritualhair.htm</a></p>

<p>Even if you don’t believe this source, hair seems to represent some type of spiritual power. Whenever we think of hippies, we think of people with long, flowing hair. Or even think of depictions of spiritual leaders, like Jesus, with long hair. Could there be any truth to this?</p>

<p><strong>Scientific Evidence</strong></p>

<p>Hair really is an extension of our nervous system. This is a pretty good study on it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120111103354.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120111103354.htm</a></p>

<p>Interestingly, though, when I researched why we even have hair, especially huge amounts of hair on our heads, there seems to be scientific mysteries behind it, and unanswered questions. </p>

<p>According to this article (<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-why-do-we-have-body-hair">https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-why-do-we-have-body-hair</a>),</p>

<p>“And our hair still plays a very important role in regulating our body temperature. When it&#39;s cold outside, tiny muscles surrounding the hair follicle cause the hairs to stand up, to trap more heat near the body. This is what happens when you get goosebumps.
So those tiny hairs all over our bodies make sense. As do nostril hairs and eyelashes, which keep dirt out of our bodies. But what about things like chest hair, pubic hair, and eyebrows? Why do they grow so much longer than the hair on our arms, and what&#39;s the point of them?
Scientists still aren&#39;t entirely sure, and we&#39;ll let you watch the episode above to find out why. But one thing&#39;s for sure, our hair definitely isn&#39;t useless.”</p>

<p>Still, there is no doubt that hair is associated with power, which is why many bald people struggle, and bald men often have a difficult time:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/13/discrimination-bald-men_n_3748896.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/13/discrimination-bald-men_n_3748896.html</a></p>

<p>So, at least psychologically, our hair holds some type of value. Many older women must dye their hair. Psychology Today explains,</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, society says that older women have to disguise and keep in check their naturally graying hair.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201505/what-your-hair-really-says-about-you">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201505/what-your-hair-really-says-about-you</a></p>

<p>And it is not really surprising that many open up to their hair dressers, in a sort of a therapy session. Do people feel more vulnerable when they are getting their hair done? Here’s an interesting article about the psychology of hair salons:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201207/the-psychology-hair-salons-stylists-therapy-free">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201207/the-psychology-hair-salons-stylists-therapy-free</a></p>

<p>So even if I cannot conclusively prove that hair has some type of spiritual element, there is no doubt that our hair does hold power both scientifically and psychologically.</p>

<p><strong>MK Ultra Victims and Their Hair</strong></p>

<p>Remember when Britney Spears shaved her head? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/britney-spears-shaved-her-head-ten-years-ago_us_58a5cff6e4b07602ad525d50">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/britney-spears-shaved-her-head-ten-years-ago_us_58a5cff6e4b07602ad525d50</a></p>

<p>And we just said she was crazy right?</p>

<p>But this seems to be a common theme among celebrities and their mk ultra breakdowns.</p>

<p>Katy Perry has short, blonde hair now:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.today.com/style/katy-perry-tells-ellen-degeneres-real-reason-behind-her-blond-t111651">http://www.today.com/style/katy-perry-tells-ellen-degeneres-real-reason-behind-her-blond-t111651</a></p>

<p>If you watched the creepy “psychology session” with Katy and her handler, she explains that she wanted to cut her hair to get away from her Katy Perry persona, perhaps to return to an altered state:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBj0qJ6bcIg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBj0qJ6bcIg</a></p>

<p>This is really long, and I wrote a post about the session if you want me to link to it.</p>

<p>Kanye West seems to have a new, strange hairdo after his recent breakdown:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2481323/kanye-west-shows-off-pink-and-blonde-hair-as-he-cuts-a-lonely-figure-at-the-movies/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2481323/kanye-west-shows-off-pink-and-blonde-hair-as-he-cuts-a-lonely-figure-at-the-movies/</a></p>

<p>And just to name some other celebs:</p>

<p>• Miley Cyrus: <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-bob-haircut">http://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-bob-haircut</a></p>

<p>• Jessica Lawrence: <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/story/jennifer-lawrence-new-haircut">http://www.teenvogue.com/story/jennifer-lawrence-new-haircut</a></p>

<p>• Eminem: Bleach, blond hair seems to be iconic, but he ditched it for a while: 
<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3884100/eminem-looks-unrecognisable-as-he-ditches-peroxide-blonde-hair-for-new-natural-look/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3884100/eminem-looks-unrecognisable-as-he-ditches-peroxide-blonde-hair-for-new-natural-look/</a></p>

<p>I’m sure there are so many more. The point is that you can claim that these things do not matter, but the media surely wants you to think they matter!</p>

<p>These hair cuts seem to have both psychological and symbolic meanings. Many of these celebrities, like Britney Spears, wanted to be “freed” from their hair, though I am not sure if there is a deeper meaning to this all.</p>

<p>From my research, blonde, long hair on women seems to be part of &quot;sex kitten programming.&quot; Feel free to type in a google search on that. Perhaps when they (women celebs) cut their hair, they feel they break from that programming?</p>

<p><strong>Why Does This Matter?</strong></p>

<p>This could be the dumbest post you read all day, or it could get your mind thinking. I definitely feel there is something more to hair, and I do think there is a conspiracy behind it.
I am not against women (or men) cutting or styling their hair, and each person has a right do decide what they do with their hair.</p>

<p>What I do believe is hair holds some type of power. Perhaps it is as simple as beautiful hair being associated with beauty itself.
Or it could be deeper than that.</p>

<p>Perhaps our hair does have spiritual significance. Why do men generally have their hair short, for example? This is a great article about why women have longer hair, and why men have shorter hair (generally of course):</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4348252/history-long-hair/">http://time.com/4348252/history-long-hair/</a></p>

<p>This kind of sums it up here:</p>

<p>“Hair is highly communicative, says Stenn, allowing individuals to send &quot;messages of health, sexuality, religiosity, power&quot; on first glance. It can be an expression of individual and group identity, and the the more attention a person (often a woman) is expected to devote to it, the more it can say. The scholar Deborah Pergament has written that hair&#39;s cultural and historic implications can be legally significant. &quot;Inferences and judgments about a person&#39;s morality, sexual orientation, political persuasion, religious sentiments and, in some cultures, socio-economic status,&quot; she notes, &quot;can sometimes be surmised by seeing a particular hairstyle.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a lot of power behind hair.</p>

<p><strong>The Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>I do not think women should cut their hair short, or dye it, or change it. I think if <em>feminists</em> really care about women, they would advocate for their real hair. Of course, they will say it’s a women’s choice, and I agree (to an extent).</p>

<p>I think that women are hiding themselves with their hair, perhaps their inner selves. When I straighten hair, I am really denying a part of myself. When women color their hair, they are not truly being honest about what they look like. When older women dye their hair, they are trying to hide their age. In other words, whatever we seem to do “do” with our hair seems to be a deceptive practice.</p>

<p>Again, I am NOT AGAINST women doing anything with their hair. All I wonder is if there is a reason we feel compelled to. What part of ourselves are we hiding?</p>

<p>When we deny our hair, are we denying an aspect of our spiritual selves? Grey hair says we are spiritually wise perhaps. Our natural hair color gives clues to our ethnicity and culture. Our hair style (curly, straight, whatever) gives clues to our genes.
Perhaps long hair makes us more sensitive, as women perhaps should be. When we cut our hair short, are we denying that sensitive part of ourselves?</p>

<p>This is conjecture of course, but I would love to hear your comments.</p>

<p>This is just a fun conspiracy, and I hope we can have a fun discussion about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This really is a post for <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>. Anyways, there is something spiritual about long hair. I&#39;m a man, and people call me Jesus (long hair and a beard). My hair is long, and I refuse to cut it.. It&#39;s like it&#39;s a part of me. Wound or scar, but a remembrance. I don&#39;t look at it as a style, but more as a part of my being. This can be dated back to ancient times. Personally, I think women who cut their hair short want to be dudes, in modern society and I&#39;m turned off. Women are strong, but you do not need a haircut to prove it. That&#39;s like a jock getting a tattoo to prove &quot;he&#39;s hard&quot;. No, you&#39;re a pussy, and self conscious...</p>

<p>FWIW; the worst period of my life happened when I had short hair. Not only did I feel off center, but my world literally caved in around me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Traditionally we really do not. The Natives held male hair in high respect. This can be seen from Native Americans to Pagans of the East in Europe (Slavs are one group). Cutting hair is more of a British thing (go back further to Rome)... Jesus had long hair and a beard, but a gentleman should not... It&#39;s a recently new thing, and I think there is something behind that... Women now think having short hair will give them authority of some sorts, no... They are playing into the same game men were forced into. Why do you think military men get shaved bald? Conformity. There is a case of the Navajo soldiers during WWII getting thrown off, because the military forced them to cut their hair... </p>

<p>On a side note, I shave my head after something bad happens in my life. I grow it out when things are good.

<p>your hair is like spiritual antenna. the vril society were all over this. they kept their hair long af, claiming it helped them communicate with spirits or other dimensional entities or w/e you wanna call em. there&#39;s also the story about native american trackers who lost their nearly supernatural intuition and tracking abilities after being recruited into the army and cutting their hair.</p>

<p>your hair is definitely a part of who you are, and cutting it can literally transform you into a different person overnight if you want it to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, lol. Obvs statement is to general. I think we also have to consider that chill goofy old people are more likely to not listen to societal norms that tell men to have short hair. It becomes a bit of a chicken or egg kind of thing. When it comes to spirituality I don&#39;t believe in linear time, so perhaps it was both chicken (long hair) and egg (spiritual/anti normative attitude) first. I still can&#39;t figure out what the hair argument means for monks that shave. One idea is that different energies are received by different things, the Buddhists are very much focussed on full transcendence, they&#39;re aiming for infinity, perhaps the cosmic energy that is associated with that is better absorbed through the skin of the head, but psychic/extra sensory and spiritual vibes (which are more the focus of first nations and old civilizations) is better perceived through long hair. Just a thought</p>

Personally I wash my hair with a very mild castille soap diluted with water as needed. I do it about once a week, and even less during the winter when the air is dry.

I only brush my hair when it is dry. I NEVER brush after a shower. I always let my hair air dry first. Any time I brush I brush my whole scalp in a methodical way. I go front to back, back to front, and side to side. While I do this I hold the intention of releasing any negativity and tension within me that is prepared to release.

I&#39;ll steep nettles in some raw apple cider vinegar for three days, and then use it like I explained above with the plain ACV. Nettle vinegar is also delicious and is great in salad dressings. I also drink a little bit every day, which I think has been good for my hair as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t ever use any dyes, hair dryers, spray, or products of any kind other than what I just wrote about. I&#39;ve been no shampoo for 7 years and I thought that was great. But just in the last three months I have switched to the wooden brush and started using nettles...and my hair has never been healthier or more lush. </p>

<p>Granted, everyone is different and it&#39;ll be up to you to figure out what will work for you hair. My hair is slightly wavy, brown, and thin and this works great for me. If you have thick, black, and/or curly hair you might need to do something completely different! A lot of people use coconut or olive oil in their hair with extraordinary results.</p>

<p>You are correct about hair products. I never use hairspray, mousse, gel etc. I only actually wash my hair with shampoo once every 3-4 days. Stripping your hair of it&#39;s natural oils everyday is not good for the health of your hair. I rinse it and comb it everyday, and I apply tea tree oil to my hair/scalp once a day, but I only use shampoo if my hair is legitimately dirty. </p>

<p>I believe diet plays a role, as well. My hair was fairly frizzy, and generally broken when I ate like shit. When I changed my diet over to non GMO, organic, and local, as well as cutting out most sugar, I discovered my hair because more full, silkier, and a little wavier. </p>

<p>Fuck. I just talked about my hair wayyyy more than I should have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, hair is linked to the soul. That is why people go grey as they get older, their connection from their soul to the physical world and their body is waning, so the power of the soul to be able to regulate the body&#39;s normal functions is decreasing hence their hair turns grey (unable to produce regular hormones). What actually happens is the soul gets further away from the body because we avoid our connection to this world. The more we avoid the further we are, makes sense right? That is why old people rarely do much, not because they are old, but they are old because they are &#39;less invested&#39; in this planet. Some people are the exception, and they usually have more energy as a result (energy is basically the soul, or comes from it, the soul is an unlimited energy source it&#39;s just our bad choices take us away from it).</p>

<p>The hair being cut is simply an attempt for, say, britney spears to take away her femininity. This is because her image is strongly linked to what attracts people and attention to her. She cut her hair to defy that, basically. </p>

<p>Also, remember how when goku goes Super Saiyan his hair changes? ;) I think that&#39;s because it&#39;s a symbol of how our closer attachment to our soul can bring about blonder hair, but I&#39;m not sure. The soul is sort&#39;ve a gold blonde, so perhaps that is the symbol, when you cry and tap into your soul purely maybe it can manifest in physical changes like that.</p>

<p>Cool post btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting read. Ancient Spartans wore their hair long. Before the final battle the ritual including cleansing yourself and applying aromas and oils to your hair to face death with dignity and glory. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Demaratus told him that the Spartans will defend the place to the death and it was custom to wash and dress their hair with special care when they intended to put their lives in great danger.</p>

<p>Hairstyles – Spartan men were known for their long, dreadlocked hair, which they believed, made a man look taller, more dignified and more terrifying.  It was said that long hair makes a handsome man even better looking and an ugly man more terrifying.  The beard was also worn long and braided with the upper lip shaved (no moustache similar to America’s own 16th President Abraham Lincoln).  When asked once why he wore his hair and beard long in the old fashioned style a Spartan replied, “So I can see my grey hairs and never do anything unworthy of them.”</p>

<p>I think Samson lost his power when Delilah cut off his hair. </p>

<p>The Native American Indians were slated to be used as trackers in Vietnam - they couldn&#39;t perform as soon as their hair was chopped off. So of course they took those poor souls in for a study and boom! They were not lying - they flat out couldn&#39;t track or perceive <em>danger</em> and lost their spiritual aura, this was <em>filmed</em> in one of the studies.</p>

<p>So at least some men have spiritual connections to their head hair!</p>

Touching a nerve: How every hair in skin feels touch and how it all gets to the brain

Neuroscientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine have discovered how the sense of touch is wired in the skin and nervous system. The new findings, published Dec. 22 in Cell, open new doors for understanding how the brain collects and processes information from hairy skin.
&quot;You can deflect a single hair on your arm and feel it, but how can you tell the difference between a raindrop, a light breeze or a poke of a stick?&quot; says David Ginty, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins. &quot;Touch is not yes or no; it&#39;s very rich, and now we&#39;re starting to understand how all those inputs are processed.&quot;
Ginty and his colleagues study how the nervous system develops and is wired. In trying to understand how touch-responsive nerve cells develop, they set out to build new tools that enable them to look at individual nerve cells. According to Ginty, there are more than 20 broad classes of so-called mechanosensory nerve cells in the skin -- of which only six account for light touch -- that sense everything from temperature to pain. But until now, the only way to tell one cell from another was to take electrical recordings as each type of cell generates a different current based on what it senses.
The team first genetically engineered mice to make a fluorescent protein in one type of nerve cell -- called the C-type low-threshold mechanosensory receptor or C-LTMR. C-LTMR cells stretch from the spinal cord to the skin, and those cells containing fluorescent protein could be seen in their entirety under a microscope. The team found that each C-LTMR cell branched to send projections to as many as 30 different hair follicles.
Mice have three different types of hair: a thick, long guard hair that accounts for only about 1 percent of total hairs on the body; a shorter hair called the awl/auchene that constitutes about 23 percent of body hair; and a fine hair called the zigzag that makes up 76 percent of body hair. The team found that most of the C-LTMR cell endings -- about 80 percent -- associate with zigzag hair follicles, the rest with the awl/auchene and none with the guard hair follicles.
The researchers then similarly marked two other types of touch nerve cells and found that each hair type has a different and specific set of nerve endings associated with it. &quot;This makes every hair a unique mechanosensory organ,&quot; says Ginty. Moreover, with their new marking tools, they found that each hair type is evenly spaced and patterned throughout the skin.
The team then wondered how all the input from these individual hairs is collected and sent to the brain. Using a different dying technique, the researchers were able to stain the other end of the cell, in the spinal cord. They found that the nerves connecting each patch of skin containing one guard hair and other associated smaller hairs line up in columns in the spinal cord -- neighboring columns correspond to neighboring patches of skin. They estimate that there are about 3,000 to 5,000 columns in the spinal cord, with each column accounting for 100 to 150 hair follicles.
So how does the brain interpret what each hair follicle experiences? &quot;How this happens is remarkable and we&#39;re fairly clueless about it,&quot; says Ginty. But he suspects that the organization of the columns is key to how all the various inputs are processed before a message goes to the brain. And while people are not as hairy as mice, Ginty believes that many of the same structures are shared. This study and the new cell-marking tools they developed, he says, open a lot of doors for new research in understanding touch and other senses.
This study was funded by the National institutes of Health, the Johns Hopkins NINDS core imaging facility and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

<p>Have you ever heard of the old (I think Navajo, actually) stories that a person&#39;s hunting sense, which is like super intuition, came from their hair, and when they lost it, they lost the sense along with it? I don&#39;t have anything more to go on than that.. lol There are doctors today who don&#39;t cut their hair because of it, and I first heard of it from this cool ass dentist I used to work for who swore by it and told me the stories. </p>

<p>No, I definitely am actually totally against the current men vs. Women status in our society, and I write about it all of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This made me think of a study that was done during the vietnam war. There was a government program using native trackers. They were finding that when these young native men had their hair cut off, they seemed to lose their abilities to perform, as though they had lost their &quot;sixth sense&quot;.
Here&#39;s a link to one article. A quick google search has more on this subject.

<p>Yea, it&#39;s male bashing to say: as a sex you make no sense. Are you to think to get that? Like, as a sex, you all are raging rag bleeders. A generalization across the board can typically be taken as offensive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s better to not make haters than to say &quot;haters gonna hate.&quot;</p>

I think you&#39;re onto something.</p>

<p>Some special kind of interaction or energy forms when your physically or iconally represent the beautiful flowerspiral of life. </p>

<p>Maybe when your hair is at is full length it most closely resembles the perfect bloom of the universe.
Flowers do it, as do pinecones and shells and fruits and trees
Perhaps our hair is something for us like what leaves are for plants. Grass is for the earth. Who knowwss~~</p>

<p>As for why baldness is also used in spiritual practice It represents a powerful moment in consciousness as well!
The flower of life blooms outward and inward.
Has anyone tried both to compare :D?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff, but the main point that makes me keep my hair short is that long hair is a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Also if long hair did indeed boost spiritual power, wouldn&#39;t the Asian monastic traditions adopt the practice instead of going the opposite route and shaving their heads?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I just wrote this and got down voted haha but maybe hair makes us extra sensitive.</p>

<p>I am wondering if that extra sensitivity would interfere with eliminating the ego, as many spiritual people try to do.</p>

<p>Also it could just be practicality and maintenance related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the things that influenced me (white male) to grow my hair out and have a bit of facial hair was Jesus  (who I believe was an ET/enlightened soul incarnating on earth to help) and many other spiritual figures has the long hair, like you said the first nations practiced growing the hair out, and I have almost never heard of an encounter or description of a &quot;positive&quot; alien that could grow hair and didn&#39;t have it super long. All of the Pleiadian space brother type contacts were with long haired beautiful men and women. There is also the testimony of Corey Goode who says he was present at a meeting of multiple inner earth civilizations who all had looked similar to humans (except for variations on skin colour and eye size) with long hair or no hair except for a group of short haired ones who were all male, and seemed fairly hostile and uncooperative at the meetings. 
Very circumstantial stuff, but I haven&#39;t heard of any nice aliens or higher civilizations with short hair so far.</p>

<p>Yes, hair is linked to the soul. That is why people go grey as they get older, their connection from their soul to the physical world and their body is waning, so the power of the soul to be able to regulate the body&#39;s normal functions is decreasing hence their hair turns grey (unable to produce regular hormones). What actually happens is the soul gets further away from the body because we avoid our connection to this world. <a href="https://www.resavr.com/comment/hair-spirituality-there-connection-9320470">[Continued...]</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post! I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this lately and have to say that I 100% agree. </p>

<p>Used to keep my hair short, shoulder length or shorter. I&#39;ve since grown it out. TBH, it feels like energetic baggage now. When it was short I was more resilient, I could bounce back quicker. Now, not so much. </p>

<p>This is also why- when she was very young-I didn&#39;t want my daughters hair to be cut.</p>

<p>Hair is powerful. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s always used in magick, etc...it&#39;s your essence. Or &quot;memory&quot; as you put it.</p>
