        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Hypothesis</h1>

<p>There exists a relationship between sightings of UFOs, contact with Extraterrestial Intelligence, and Psychic Phenomena. Intelligence agencies across the globe have come to this conclusion and the reason for their silence on these topics is that they still do not have a full grasp on what exactly the implications of these topics will have on the population.</p>

<p>To fully understand this relationship, we must get a grasp on each of these topics individually.</p>

<h1>Project StarGATE</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing">Remote Viewing</a> is a method of perceiving non-local information of the universe using the power of human consciousness. The CIA began studying the potential of Remote Viewing at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International">SRI</a> in the 1960&#39;s with the famous psychic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann">Ingo Swann</a>. Ingo was one of the first members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">Project StarGATE</a> which was the study performed by the CIA to determine the weaponization capability of psychic phenomena. The reason the CIA was so invested in this area of research was that the Soviets during the Cold War had spent over 20 million Rubies by 1973 on a similar remote viewing/telepathy program (<a href="http://blog.learnremoteviewing.com/?p=1562">source</a>). I will be referring to the CIA in this section because of their recent declassification surrounding a lot of these documents. 
<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">Here is a document</a> purporting to show a Remote Viewing session of Mars at 1 Million B.C. which we will come back to later in the post.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality">Nonlocality</a> is a property of Quantum Mechanics which states that entangled particles affect each others&#39; quantum state instantaneously, seemingly transmitting information faster than the speed of light. In <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">this</a> CIA paper we gain insight into what the CIA calls <a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/catalog/122">The Gateway Process</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-Sync">Hemi-Sync</a> technology. This paper shows Wayne McDonnell writing to a commander:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand how and why the process works</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then goes on to explain the foundations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a>, <a href="https://npepjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40810-015-0015-7">Brain Coherence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">Holograms</a>, a universal consciousness matrix, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience">OBEs</a> and much more. He does all of this to lay out the idea that under altered states of consciousness the human brain is capable of perceiving nonlocal information and capable of interacting with a holographic underlying framework to the universe.</p>

<p>As if this isn&#39;t strange enough, there is a really shocking point at the end of this paper in McDonnell&#39;s conclusion. After describing how to induce the gateway experience in an individual, he states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeeded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is important because it establishes precedent from a CIA document that human beings are capable of interacting with intelligent entities while being in an altered state of consciousness</p>

<h1>Remote Viewing and Humanoid Contact</h1>

<p>Revisiting the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">Mars paper</a> with this new insight into the Gateway Experience we gain a better understanding of the purpose of the experiment. After having the subject place themselves on Mars at approximately 1 million B.C., the subject observes some type of mass geological event. He is asked to move in time to before this event, and we get the following interaction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUB: I&#39;m seeing ah.... It&#39;s like a perception of a shadow of people, very tall... thin, it&#39;s only a shadow. It&#39;s as if they were there and they&#39;re not, not there anymore.</p>

<p>MON: Go back to a period of time where they are there.</p>

<p>SUB: I just keep seeing very large people. They appear thin and tall, but they&#39;re very large. Ah... wearing some kind of strange clothes. </p>

<p>MON: All right, now holding in this time period, holding in this time period, I want to move from your physical location in space to another physical location, but in this time period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we find that the time of interest in this experiment was <em>specifically</em> the time period when some type of humanoids were supposedly living on Mars. The experiment then goes on to hit major geographic points on Mars where the subject describes Pyramids, Obelisks, and large megalithic structures. The experimenters are not remotely surprised to find humanoids on the surface of Mars, in fact it appears to be the entire purpose of the experiment: To observe geographic locations of Mars which might have once supported actual humanoid life over a million years ago. When the subject makes contact with another humanoid, we get the following exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MON: Move close to one of them and ask them to tell you about themselves.</p>

<p>SUB: They&#39;re ancient people. They&#39;re ah... they&#39;re dying, it&#39;s past their time or age. They&#39;re very philosophic about it. They&#39;re looking for ah... a way to survive and they just can&#39;t seem to get their way out, they can&#39;t seem to find their way out... so they&#39;re hanging on while they look or wait for something to return or something coming with the answer...</p>

<p>MON: What is is they&#39;re waiting for?</p>

<p>SUB: A group of a party of them that went to find ah...new place to live. It&#39;s like I&#39;m getting all kinds of overwhelming input of the corruption of their environment. It&#39;s failing very rapidly and this group went somewhere, like a long way to find another place to live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MON: All right, now before you leave this individual, ask him if there is any way that you, ask him if he knows who you are and is there any way you can help him in his present predicament?</p>

<p>SUB: All I get is that they must just wait. Doesn&#39;t know who I am. Think he perceives I&#39;m just a hallucination or something.</p>

<p>MON: Okay, when the others left, these people are waiting, when the others left, how did they go?</p>

<p>SUB: ... It looks like the inside of a larger boat. Very rounded walls and shiny metal.</p>

<p>MON: Go along with them on their journey and find out where it is they go.</p>

<p>SUB: Impression of a really crazy place with volcanos and gas pockets and strange plants, very volatile place, it&#39;s very much like going from frying pan into the fire. Difference is there seems to be a lot of vegetation where the other place did not have it. And different kind of storm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this interaction, we get the impression that this experiment yielded information showing a tall, thin humanoid race living on the surface of Mars with an impending cataclysm. These people then leave Mars and arrive on a different planet with different problems but at the least a large source of vegetation.</p>

<h1>Wikileaks files implying Government knowledge and interaction with ETI / UFOs</h1>

<p>It is tough to convince people in a couple short paragraphs that the government is aware of extraterrestials and have had a relationship with them since at least the 1950&#39;s, so I don&#39;t intend to spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader that this is the case. Instead I will cite documents which were released from Wikileaks to show you that at the very least there are official diplomatic cables and emails between high profile politicians and government officials which supports the idea that extraterrestials have visited Earth in the past and are more than likely still visiting us. This idea also includes the possibility that the Apollo program was not what it appeared to be at first glance.</p>

<h2>Emails to John Podesta from Edgar Mitchell and Tom Delonge</h2>

<p>Regardless of your opinion of Tom Delonge, I think it&#39;s important to include these emails here because it shows at the very least government and military officials involved with the coverup of the UFO phenomena cooperating with him and feeding him information which is tied to the psychic phenomena and crashed UFO sightings. For important sections of the emails I will include quotes.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3099">General McClasland working with Tom Delonge</a></p>

<p>When Roswell crashed, they shipped it to the laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. General McCasland was in charge of that exact laboratory up to a couple years ago.</p>

<p>The juicier emails come from the 6th man to walk on the moon: Edgar Mitchell. He outright claims human interaction with ETI.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6983">Email showing Terri Mansfield setting up a Skype meeting for Podesta</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>In ongoing requests for our Skype talk to discuss Disclosure and the difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent obedient ETI and the celestials of this universe, and because Hillary and Bill Clinton were intimates of Laurance Rockefeller who had an avid interest in ETI, I direct your attention to Scott Jones, PhD.
In Scott’s book Voices From the Cosmos, he describes himself as an octogenarian in full karmic payback made following 30 years in the military, half in combat arms and half in intelligence.
He references you in his ETI matter, as well as the Catholic Church.
Disclosure is now top priority for ETI itself in protection of the people.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1802">Email with an attached space treaty that was voted on by the UN in 2008 and 2015</a></p>

<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>Because the War in Space race is heating up, I felt you should be aware of several factors as you and I schedule our Skype talk. Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41591">Email discussing extraterrestial disclosure</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>John, I would like to schedule a phone conversation at your earliest
convenience to discuss what I feel are intensifying imperatives for
extraterrestrial disclosure.</p>

<p>For many years you and I have shared a mutual vision of disclosure. I highly commend your public record urging disclosure which includes the forward you wrote for Leslie Kean’s book and your call for the Pentagon’s release of 25 year old classified government papers on UFO investigations. When our government releases this classified information we become the twenty-fifth country to make public disclosure.</p>

<p>You and I also share a mutual vision for earth sustainability apparent in the escalating demand for a change in global energy policy. Our phone discussion will also include the zero point energy research and applications developed by my Quantrek international science team. Advanced energy science is linked to consciousness research and public disclosure of the extraterrestial presence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They fear the amount of people waking up because it works like a chain reaction, our brainwaves and thoughts affect other&#39;s brainwaves and thoughts and with meditation we strengthen our connection with the universe. We&#39;re intelligent creators and they&#39;ve tried to keep our minds under control but the human spirit cannot allow it forever, there will be a breaking point. This battle we&#39;ve been in for millennia is actually a battle for our minds and the power we possess to affect our surroundings.    </p>

<p>There aren&#39;t powerful ETs flying around trying to fight the cabal and rescue us out of the goodness of their hearts, there&#39;s no cabal infighting bullshit or Neil Keenan saving your gold in a secret vault. We&#39;re constantly co-creating our reality together and because of the internet and a strong need to be more, it&#39;s US that&#39;s creating the necessary circumstances to rescue ourselves and the sooner new agers realize this, the sooner our global revolution will occur.  </p>

<p>I was targeted when I started to research about ETs and meditate, they&#39;ve induced fake demon possession and alien contact experiences using powerful mind control technology with UFO sightings over my house so I know there&#39;s a blue beam sorta thing going on, IMO it&#39;s so we believe other beings are rescuing us so we give up on helping ourselves while they strengthen their technology for global domination of our minds (they can create almost any thought, feeling, sound, image, taste, 3d dreams, control of organs, speech, limbs and don&#39;t need microchips anymore)  </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not certain of ET existence but I&#39;m certain of how fucking powerful our minds can be. I lean more towards there&#39;s a whole other interdimensional multiverse that is accessible with lot of meditation or certain plants. It&#39;s connected to everything ever, it&#39;s also the dream world and there are different astral levels. The more we engage with it, the more we connect with our subconscious mind and become masters of our own lives. So no wonder there&#39;s been such a focus to pollute so many various religions to confuse us, remote viewing experts are CIA trained and meditators with different intentions than TPTB get tortured. </p>

<p>In short, I guess if you want alien ppl showing up bringing you some mad technology to help advance us, we could probably make it happen, I don&#39;t get why it has to be aliens and not some regular joe in his workshop coming up with awesome ideas though. I think humanity is a little confused due to technology and lot of years of mind control from everywhere but we gonna find our way soon, just stop fighting each other and rest will fall in place :)   </p>
