        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Waking up the first 5% of the population is the toughest part. Then the next 5% but eventually so many people are awake that they all just start waking each other up quickly. For example, if 25% of the population was awake, that would mean 1 out of 4 people are awake and those 25% would very quickly wake up the rest causing the woke percentage rate to skyrocket above 75% in no time. </p>

<p>Also, these woke people will be fed new information daily which is almost always extremely repulsive (pedophilia, Satanism, rituals, cannibalism, misery for profit, ect..). This means that there is almost a 100% chance that most of the world is going to be extremely repulsed by the cabal rulers. </p>

<p>Once we reach this high level of disgust, the people are going to be frantically trying to figure out what to do since everyone wants to live free from suffering. That&#39;s going to mean that billions of people are are going to be using their billions of minds simultaneously which is optimal for the masses rather than just 5% of the population using their brains. Some of these people work in government, some have insider access, some work at CNN, some work in Rome, some are in the military, ect...  All of these minds will focus on the same exact thing and that is solving our cabal problem. Imagine when the masses work simultaneously to solve this global problem? The amount of power behind that force is unfathomable. </p>

<p>So... Doesn&#39;t this mean we are guaranteed to succeed? Also, one important note that people will soon realize is the power of unity. This cabal problem is forcing people to unite and get over their childish racism and prejudicial feelings  and this &quot;forced&quot; unity is natural in a dire situation like this. The power of billions of united people across the world is extremely powerful and that power will be used to squeeze the cabal like a giant, worldwide, united snake squeezing itself tight to destroy its prey.</p>

<p>Also, it is important to know that the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; technique is extremely powerful. The family unit is the most powerful institution man has ever created and the cabal has been trying to destroy it for ages. They even have media showing people killing their own parents or children now which they dub &quot;entertainment&quot;. This is all part of the divide and conquer process. They did succeed on dividing us in many ways (race, ethnicity, gender, political stance, by favorite sports team, by type of character, ect..) which is unfortunate but that can all be voided out of our lives once people realize for themselves that the divisions are killing us. In fact, unity is at the dead center of the process that will end up purging the entire cabal. Unity is the way that generates unthinkable power among the people and people will realize this once they finish uniting out of sheer necessity and once they see the benefits, they will keep it as a normal way of life. </p>

<p>tldr: With the trajectory of how the masses have been acting and the events unfolding, it seems that success is guaranteed. The only way to lose at this point is if the masses decided to just give up which doesn&#39;t seem likely. It was only a year ago when a large swath of the masses suddenly awakened and we have been hitting the floor running aggressively every since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never understood the user of the term &quot;woke&quot;, because it&#39;s usually not in relation to anything. Woke to what? Your particular beliefs, or just social awareness in general. What if their version of woke doesn&#39;t jive with yours? Do you really believe 12% of the population is &quot;woke&quot; to the satanic, pedophilia, cannibalistic cabal you&#39;re mentioning? That number seems waaaaaay too high. I also think you overestimate how much the average person cares - if it doesn&#39;t effect them then it doesn&#39;t much matter.  </p>

<p>I think the &quot;we&#39;re for sure going to win&quot; attitude is dangerous. Complacency kills, and feeling like victory is guaranteed is something that breeds complacency. Is this the most social aware time in history? Maybe in ours, but the world over? I don&#39;t know about that. I guess the question, then, is what constitutes a victory?</p>

<p>People who suffer will always end up caring. Suffering forces people to care and the suffering has spread globally. </p>

<p>My point is that the suffering is forcing people to put in work. Complacency is death but complacency is easy when there isnt&#39; any suffering. Now that the suffering has hit an all time high worldwide in recent history, the people have no choice but to put in work because they can&#39;t stand the pain anymore. That&#39;s the only positive aspect of suffering. It forces people into action. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my point though, does someone have to believe in a cabal for them to be woke? Or rather, when you say &quot;the cabal&quot; your referring to something specific. What if they don&#39;t share that belief?</p>

<p>Is that really true though? People suffer all the time, and have been suffering for, like, ever. Why would now be the tipping point?

<p>Yup, a lot of people don&#39;t even know the cabal exists. This is why we have to wake them up. </p>

<p>The difference between now and 20 years ago is that the people of the world are suffering much more now than they were before. Eventually, the suffering motivates people into action. This is just how it works. People always have 2 options. Put in work to fix an issue now or wait until the suffering is so bad that we can&#39;t take it anymore and we are almost &quot;forced&quot; into action. The level of suffering is insane around the world right now. I&#39;ve never seen it this bad and I&#39;m too young to know how it was during the Great Depression. I hear a man who got a bottle of ketchup for his birthday during the Great Depression was a happy man. </p>

<p>And therein lies my issue - I, and I&#39;m sure many other people, have a hard time putting faith in someone who says &quot;I know this particular thing to be true, and we&#39;re doomed unless you believe this things I do&quot;.
