        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Earth is spindle torus with a semi hollow core and axis&#39; which are generating the atmosphere. The Antarctica is the north pole, positive, and output. The Arctic is south pole, negative and input. They switched the poles around. Energy is recycled through this system. The core is a plasmic center similar to the sun and is in magnetic orbit with the sun. As a spindle torus it is almost a perfect sphere. It is off a little which is why we have 365 days instead of 360 days in a year. 360 degrees is a circle. This further proves spherical. The seasonal cycles are what established the yearly system. Look up random images of the oceans horizon and put a straight edge to the horizon to see curvature for those that think the Earth is flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, but you said it&#39;s not gravity but magnetism. So how come a compass only points to true north even when you are in the southern hemisphere? Aren&#39;t both poles magnetic? Take your time. </p>

<p>How does water curve around a ball spinning 1000 mph? Is water magnetic?</p>

<p>How come the horizon is flat ? The ocean is water that doesn&#39;t curve, and the earth is 70 percent water.  I have all the proof showing how the ocean being zoomed in on and things that should be below the horizon become visible.</p>

<p>You can see Chicago from Grand rapids Michigan when Chicago should be below the curve from that distance.</p>

<p>Rivers like the Nile, start below the equator and travel 4000 miles north. That means on a ball the Nile would have to climb 500 miles of curve to get to its northern delta.</p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t convince you that you are not on a ball then yes you are deceived. By NASA, by government education, and you Deceive yourself by not researching flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity is like magnetic weight. The Latin word Gravis means weight and is where the word gravity derives from. The curved horizon can be seen especially the ocean&#39;s horizon. All matter is magnetic to various degrees including water. A compass points to the letters N, S, E, or W. I can find hundreds of random photos showing the Earth&#39;s curvature by looking up sky diving photos, photos from a plane, photos of the ocean with the horizon. I will put some links to completely random photos that show curvature. Put a straight edge up to the horizon to see the degree of curvature. Since the Earth is so massive to observe curvature it requires a point offering depth and height. This is the most absurd argument. If the Earth was flat the water would be falling off the edge. If the Earth was flat than every commercial pilot would have to be in on it. So when a pilot in California flies to Asia like Japan or China it would have to fly across the United States since Asia is connected to Europe therefore we know exactly where it is. Do you see how absurd your argument that the Earth is flat is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh fuck that, those photos all have curved lenses. Obvious. Why do you waste that time finding curved photos taken with curved lenses when you can actually be researching how it&#39;s flat? Why do you defend this Ball deception with shit proofs like this?</p>

<p>You want to see how it really is?</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/results?q=30%20mile%20zoom%20on%20ocean%20horizon&amp;amp;sm=3">https://m.youtube.com/results?q=30%20mile%20zoom%20on%20ocean%20horizon&amp;amp;sm=3</a></p>

<p>Pick one, anyone. I have more proofs it&#39;s flat than you do it&#39;s round, trust me, I&#39;m not fucking with you. I like you and your info and I don&#39;t want to see you deceived man. You know these fuckers , these elite , they are tricking us. And why do you defend it? Everyone has been indoctrinated and when you try to help them see the deception they think I am a demon or some shit.  I&#39;m used to this actually but I don&#39;t fucking care, I&#39;m not falling for this shit, either should you.</p>

<p>Now, do you actually believe what NASA shows us from space? Do you? If so we have a lot to discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like everything is curved . You just proved it by showing a go pro pic. Way to go man! Boy you showed me alright , golly gee .</p>

<p>And of course I&#39;m angry, you called me a demon, remember?  Listen man, NASA shows all cgi of a spinning globe and they never get it right. They doctor photos of a globe Earth. You have never seen the earth, ever! </p>

<p>And why do you automatically assume water falls off the edge? That&#39;s totally retarded and no flat earther would say such nonsense. Talk about a straw man. You already straw man me before you even start to reply. You don&#39;t have an open mind because your mind was already made up for you by NASA and government education and the constant programming by the media. Every movie or news will show you a spinning ball , you just take it for granted. </p>

<p>If you really researched it you would see how it&#39;s all pseudoscience to back it up. You are dumb. I get angry that people are dumb and constantly show me stupid bullshit to try to justify their false beliefs.</p>

<p>200 proofs the earth is flat by Dubay, watch it. At least two hundred. You have zero proofs you are on a Ball. ZERO. A go pro lens has been your best argument. You are smarter than this or I wouldn&#39;t waste my time on yet another deceived person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok now you really have nothing . How about you don&#39;t even bother me until you can disprove flat earth. How about that Mr go pro?</p>

<p>Calling me a demon is trite and lacks originality and creativity. And heart. Your a mean motherfucker. Your agenda against flat earth would be better if you even remotely could reason your own existence beyond families.  You have had ample opportunity to impress the world and debunk flat and you have failed. Not my fault . you</p>

<p>then calling me a demon because you have no intelligence on this subject. Saying I&#39;m making a straw man when I never did. Typical reasoning skills of a ball earther, go pro proof carrying ass hole.  And a fucking liar too. Thanks for showing me your level of incompetence .

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Violent and oppressive. More so than all the others. What the fuck is your vendetta? You expose family corruption and cultism. But willingly use as evidence a government space agency and education system as perfectly honest awareness?? And slightly alter that model to something similar and still claim your go pro pics of earth don&#39;t conflict with your own torus model? If you are trusting NASA then obviously they don&#39;t support your theory, now do they?</p>

<p>And you call the people who expose their shit a Cult of demon serpents? What does that even mean? I don&#39;t speak dark ages.</p>

<p>We are the only people on the planet who see the deception. We are literally saving your asses from the people you really despise. Man I dont think you understand the impact this deception has on human consciousness. And I really don&#39;t think you know how manipulated you are with like an implant in your mind that would oppose your only liberation of your consciousness. I can&#39;t stress enough how manipulated your mind has been by these people for you to believe them.  Your real identity is magnificent and our world is more incredible than you will know. And I&#39;m not kidding. It&#39;s not my fault they lied. But you can literally take your bullshit and stuff it now. You are acting like you are afraid of your own awareness. </p>

<p>As you can see it&#39;s gilded and filled with non sense as the top comments. If you trust that narrative then you must not have gotten into the exploration of the elite groups behind this deception. I hope you will soon.

    <div class="md"><p>Well Neil Tyson wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>That&#39;s where there&#39;s this confusion over Neil saying the Earth is pear shaped - Because he&#39;s referring to the most minuscule detail. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because the Earth, even though it&#39;s so so SO close to being a perfect sphere, it&#39;s ever so slightly bottom heavy, and a teeny tiny bit elongated at the top - Which is why he calls it pear shaped. </p>

<p>In reality, the shape variation is indistinguishable to the naked eye from a sphere if you look at photos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A rainbow, moves with a curving trajectory, agreed?  </p>

<p>Definition of the word &#39;arch&#39;: &quot;a shape resembling an arch or a thing with such a shape.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mention full or half-circle either.  I didn&#39;t ask nor argue whether they are &quot;whole&quot; or not, only why are they &quot;arched&quot;.</p>

<p>My question stands, and to put it more simply this time: Why are rainbows curved/arched?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. To answer your question, it&#39;s because of your perspective. To expand upon that answer, rainbows form a circle, and from your perspective, you are only able to see about half of that circle because the horizon blocks the rest. The higher you are, the more likely you are to be to see the full circle. And if you&#39;re really high, you might even see a double rainbow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree that it is because of perspective here on earth and that perspective is from a flat-earth.  I believe rainbows are arched/curved because of the hyperbolic nature of the sphere of the planet we are on, that is Earth, and when the light hits the atmosphere of this sphere, the light curves along with the sphere (hence why the light is divided into many colors/prism).</p>

<p>Basically the same reason why some scientists believe light bends around objects in space when viewing from a distance.  </p>

<p>I also disagree that you need to be really high to see a double rainbow, as I&#39;ve personally seen a double rainbow from the ground (it was amazing to see).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a full-circled rainbow, but I&#39;m not saying it hasn&#39;t occurred either.</p>

<p>I guess in the end, agree to disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Earth generates a magnetic field around it. Out of the Antarctic the field pushes out an ionized field of particles or plasma which then hit the magnetic field creating an equal and opposite effect and therefor downward magnetic force. Mercury creates this suspsension. The ionized field is then pulled into the Arctic hitting the core of the Earth creating an opposite reaction and generating an upward magnetic field. The moon regulates the push. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth is one of the best examples of how people will believe what they are told and not examine evidence and think critically about the world around them. Although certainly not a novice level conspiracy theory, it is right there in front of everyone&#39;s faces, for example the azimuthal-equidistant map used on the UN symbol for the masses to see regularly, as per required by the law of free will you have been given and will continue to be given the opportunity to see the truth. NASA is clearly faking their stuff that is entry level conspiracy theory and the red herring of aliens and Star Wars type nonsense is an alluring rabbit hole that most don&#39;t get past. Perform your due diligence in researching and vetting flat earth and you will be amazed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Violent and oppressive. More so than all the others. What the fuck is your vendetta? You expose family corruption and cultism. But willingly use as evidence a government space agency and education system as perfectly honest awareness?? And slightly alter that model to something similar and still claim your go pro pics of earth don&#39;t conflict with your own torus model? If you are trusting NASA then obviously they don&#39;t support your theory, now do they?</p>

<p>And you call the people who expose their shit a Cult of demon serpents? What does that even mean? I don&#39;t speak dark ages.</p>

<p>We are the only people on the planet who see the deception. We are literally saving your asses from the people you really despise. Man I dont think you understand the impact this deception has on human consciousness. And I really don&#39;t think you know how manipulated you are with like an implant in your mind that would oppose your only liberation of your consciousness. I can&#39;t stress enough how manipulated your mind has been by these people for you to believe them.  Your real identity is magnificent and our world is more incredible than you will know. And I&#39;m not kidding. It&#39;s not my fault they lied. But you can literally take your bullshit and stuff it now. You are acting like you are afraid of your own awareness. </p>
