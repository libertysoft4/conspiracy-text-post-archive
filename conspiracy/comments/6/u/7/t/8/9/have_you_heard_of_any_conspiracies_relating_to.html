    <div class="md"><p>They say it&#39;s because there will be so many people concentrated in an area and I guess trying to use their phones? But, it really doesn&#39;t make much sense to me either, and this has somewhat bothered me. In my town I&#39;ve seen a department of homeland security police vehicle roaming around and it feels like &quot;they&quot; are going to attempt to orchestrate some sort of false flag attack where I live. I&#39;ve never believed in false flag attacks before, but I feel like I&#39;m kind of waking up to what is going om here. Or maybe I&#39;m just too stuck in my mind. Who knows  ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Article I read stated there will be a massive influx of people traveling to view the full eclipse along its path. Many of these areas are rural and don&#39;t have a lot of cellphone tower and capacity. The influx of devices, people taking pictures, talking on the phone, and using data could cause connectivity issues. </p>

<p>Also power outages could happen due to power surges from solar panels going offline then coming back on all at once. </p>

<p>Dunno the reality of either concern, but I suppose both are plausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your awake enough to realize something isnt quite right about the nature of our reality, and the nature of the sun and moon, then you probably just &quot;feel&quot; something is significant. The sun projects information/energy and the sun draws energy. When the two discs align I believe that there is either some sort of cleansing effect on the area below it or to the moon itself. The sun and Moon serve as signs for seasons (not Spring, summer, fall, winter) or appointed times. Mankind is gradually being ascended In a sense energetically and the old order is falling apart. Things will get rough but the good is coming for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at all the ancient depictions of the sun and moon, the yin and yang positive and negative, earth is the &quot;ground&quot;. The sun and moon regulate life cycles on earth, the sun is the heat and positive side of the electro(sun)-magnetic(moon) universe. These energies affects everything from sleep and wake cycles to hormone secretions and mood, they regulate them all. When they line up like this I imagine there is something happening energetically to the ground below of all caught in its rays, there is a reason these two lights were/are worshipped, something is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That all makes sense, but why do you believe it will have a cleansing effect and that things are going to get bad before they get better? Is there some sort of that needs to be purged? If so, is the purging of that evil going to make things worse for us, but only for the time being? Is this the only life we&#39;ll ever live?

    <div class="md"><p>The sun will be behind the moon projecting information and energy through the moon and onto us, I am saying that it will do something differently onto the area below. The overall theme is that eclipses signify change. They always have and I believe there is good reason for it. If you want to know my viewpoint I believe that we are in the days of the biblical time of the end, many religions have similar and complementary information regarding an end to this world and the birth of a new world. The bible says that the end is brought forth like birth pains, meaning it will get worse and worse until a conclusion. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm">Matt 24:21</a> talks about this. It will be hard because it is described as an event(s) that will never be paralleled on earth, it is temporary though and the new world will emerge shortly after. <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Rev. 21</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that way because I have grown to find that it explains everything that is going on and what has happened in the past and is accurately describing what the future is bringing with great detail. We have been conditioned as a society to shy away or even reject even reading it, it used to be a crime to even own a Bible and you could of been killed for it. And there&#39;s many different religious books that coincide and explain similar things about what&#39;s coming and why things are the way they are.</p>
