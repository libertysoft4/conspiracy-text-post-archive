        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here are some of the interesting points found inside:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Right off the bad, it says do not distribute this book to cis White Males, non-POC, non-LGBTQ people, aka fascists! Hmm. Interesting how they labeled all these groups fascists. Calling White Males fascists is simply racism at its finest. </p></li>
<li><p>They say to keep this manual a secret. They know if this gets out to the masses, it will bury Antifas reputation. </p></li>
<li><p>The manual claims white males control the entire media system in American when its clearly the Zionists who do. Sounds like they are trying to manipulate the fragile minds of the Antifa protesters. </p></li>
<li><p>Quote: &quot;Whites, especially cis white males, have proven to be the greatest evil mankind has ever known.&quot; Divide and conquer at its finest folks!</p></li>
<li><p>Quote: &quot;No one has proven to do more harm than white men&quot;. More divide and conquer. They want to shift blame from the real enemies like Zionists, Black Nobility, Illuminati, ect.. and throw it on the common white male. They are desperately trying to cause a civil war to save themselves from the coming day of the rope. </p></li>
<li><p>The solution to the &quot;White Problem&quot; according to this book is a &quot;New World Order&quot; or &quot;One World Government&quot; to protect the other races from the Whites! This shit looks like it was written by George Soros himself!</p></li>
<li><p>It goes onto say that anyone who disagrees with Antifa must be condemned as a racist, homophobe, mysoginist, ect.. When all else fails, compare that person to Hitler!</p></li>
<li><p>If any of the minority groups protect conservatives or Whites, single them out and belittle them as &quot;delusional&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>This playbook admits that immigrants from all over the world are being poured into America to eventually turn the White population into a minority by 2117.</p></li>
<li><p>Tips on using white guilt and white shame against whites. Also, it says to leave whites that are working for antifa alone. </p></li>
<li><p>Social media is the new battleground. </p></li>
<li><p>It says to create an echo chamber for terms like fascist, racist, homophobe, ect.. on social media. </p></li>
<li><p>It asks members to brainwash the youth for antifa. </p></li>
<li><p>It asks to target all non-whites and pit them against the entire white population. They are saying to make non-whites feel special like they are from a positive group when, in reality, Antifa is a domestic terrorist group run by George Soros. </p></li>
<li><p>The book says Antifa wants to end up controlling not only the media but also positions in politics. It says once antifa makes it to office, they will raise taxes. This group in reality wants to create a socialist state which is the half way mark to the real goal of state controlled Communism. </p></li>
<li><p>They plan on brainwashing white people that being childless is cool (should be a personal choice in reality) and providing plenty of birth control pills and abortion opportunities to them so they won&#39;t have babies. They want to manipulate non-whites in the opposite way be reducing birth control opportunities or abortion opportunities while pushing for more babies. </p></li>
<li><p>Holy shit. They plan on implanting chips into people&#39;s right hands in a way so that they can wave a wand and find out what that person makes, what he posts on social media, what his political beliefs are, ect.. This sounds like they want access to mind reading so they can push non-antifa supporters into some kind of corner (prison?, death?) This people are sickening. George Soros is a cuck!</p></li>
<li><p>Antifa wants to be America&#39;s thought police! They want to wave those wands and gather information from a person&#39;s hand chip. For example, if a white guy said the N word on social media, they want to fine him, lower his status, lower his income, or even imprison him. Thought police is the last thing anyone wants. This Antifa is a fascist piece of shit organization. </p></li>
<li><p>They blamed the wars in the Middle East on White people..</p></li>
<li><p>It claims Osama Bin Ladin did 9-11 because White people dropped atom bombs in Japan..</p></li>
<li><p>More info on making a one world government where food supplies will ship from America to all the starving people around the world. </p></li>
<li><p>Quote: &quot;Those who can&#39;t work will be supplied an unlimited supply of opiates, marijuana, meth, and cocaine to occupy their free time. Sound to good to be true?&quot; I&#39;m not even blaming the paid protestors anymore. Soros is paying them $25 an hour and these are probably poor, starving citizens but Soros needs to but shut down ASAP. He is clearly delusional. </p></li>
<li><p>Quote: &quot;We are Antifa. You are either with us or you are a fascist.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Quote. &quot;The next crucial step is to threaten anyone&#39;s livelihood who dares speak out against our agenda.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>It goes onto say that they want to drive whites into the underground where they wither in shame. People who end up hiring white people will be shamed and dealt with. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>OK. Now I understand. George Soros is a racist, delusional madman. </p>

<h1>18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents.</h1>

<p>If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how “sensitive they are to criticism”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, sinister lady who scanned this document in must have used her evil genius to make a fake coffee stain and fake scribbling along with writing up a modern day &quot;protocols of Zion&quot; to make this document look real. Muahahahahaaaa</p>

<p>Lol, what if she just put her coffee cup on the document and scribbled with a pen to make sure it works? Is it beneficial to be this cynical towards each other? Does cynicism unite us or does it divide us?</p>

<p>Imagine if you walked and picked up mail from your mailbox and someone said &quot;Oh look, that evil man is picking up instructions for a spy mission he has to run for the Russians. Treason!&quot; But in all reality, you were just picking up the Sunday newspaper. (Shrug)</p>
