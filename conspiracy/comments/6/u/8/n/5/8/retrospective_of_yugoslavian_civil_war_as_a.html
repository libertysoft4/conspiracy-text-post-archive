        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mmm-hmm ... I&#39;m from former Yugoslavia and we had zero guns available before 1990&#39;s , and it didn&#39;t seem to stop us from raging bloody civil wars for years.</p>

<p>Civil war never starts from some &#39;people&#39; raging with guns.</p>

<p>Even then it was a series of well orchestrated incidents that served to infuriate people and militarize them against each other. Weapons were distributed accordingly, some people got rich on that. Laughing at us stupid cunts.</p>

<p>Separation and hate was greatly sponsored by &#39;outside factors&#39;. Media was biased. Slowly moving towards division and hate. Peace propagating voices were muffled in the media. In a matter of one year, things escalated beyond reasonable control. All hell broke loose.</p>

<p>Sadly, things happening in US are looking somewhat like this.</p>

<p>If 3 of 4 major incidents happen , that instigate great divide between people , if you heard someone/party/origanisation is starting to distribute weapons, if it starts to feel so hot that real people start having protests for peace and reason, then you&#39;ll know shit has hit the fan.</p>

<p>In my memory, it takes about a year and a half to get from &#39;these people are furious for the right reasons&#39; to &#39;why the fuck is everybody shooting everybody&#39;.</p>

<p>The difference being that Yugoslavia was made from at least 7 constitution nationalities , all kept together under the flag of socialist unity, and once the civil liberties dawned on us, we took a wrong step into nationalistic hate. That weakness was largely used by internal and foreign evil forces.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, for a brief moment at the fall of communism, around 1990., it looked like we could live together and financialy better, with free market, and then it all crashed.</p>

<p>I hope nothing of this happens. I wouldn&#39;t wish a civil war at my worst enemy. A lot of innocent people get hurt.</p>

<p>PS. In retrospective, Yugoslavia had a civil war so the rich could get richer, a lot of state owned companies could have been sold to rich for silly little money, and some kind of (4th strongest army in Europe at the time) millitary dissolution and making smaller , weaker countries instead. And the issues we waged wars about - pale in comparison to atrocities and loss we had. </p>

<p>Our weak point (various nationalities with unsloved teritorial and national issues) was taken advantage of, and we were thrown into civil war. I&#39;m saying &#39;thrown&#39; , &#39;cause none of those issues existed or were talked about just 2 years prior to civil war. They were blown out of proportion by &#39;factors&#39; that got rich on it.</p>

<p>What are your issues , US ?  The ones that could and will be blown out of proportion ? You need to cut the root of financing for those who scream bloody murder.</p>

<p>Smart people learn from their mistakes, stupid people repeat them, and geniuses learn from both of them.</p>

<p>Be geniuses , USA!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money/power has been running America since the inception of he Federal Reserve. I believe that the American people are enlightened enough to see through the bullshit, but the effforts to divide us are extraordinary. United we stand, divided we fall. </p>

<p>I would also argue that Yugoslavia WAS strong - 90% literacy rate, fastest growing GDP in Europe, and the 3rd largest military in Europe. Yugoslavia was a threat to western economy, particularly Germany. Despite Tito&#39;s success in uniting Yugoslavs under one flag and one nation, the religious propaganda destroyed the great relationships that Muslims, Orthodox, and Catholics celebrated for decades. In fact, as the economy began to collapse (through the efforts of the IMF and World Bank), the people stood united. Then out of nowhere, everyone hated each other&#39;s guts.</p>

<p>The difference between America and Yugoslavia is that we don&#39;t have this religious tension, however fabricated it was. And I find it ironic that America seems to be moving towards the hybrid capitalist/socialist mode that Yugoslavia built its success on. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That has nothing to do with nationalistic hate. It&#39;s called multiculturalism. It always ends the same way. There is a breaking point where people want to be left alone by the government and by other people trying to force their values and taxes on others. Nationalism is the cure to this. Unifying the population is the only way to restore society. And this will never occur under multiculturalism. Different groups under multiculturalism always blame the others and try to enforce their will on the other groups through activism and taxation and eventually rallies and riots.</p>

<p>You answered this in your post. All these people being kept together under a socialist cultural marxist regime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In retrospective, Yugoslavia had a civil war so the rich could get richer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost every civil war ends with this. Some civil wars end with the selling or buying of companies for cheap. Some end with rights and freedoms being removed. In either case, it&#39;s the manufacturers of weapons and agendas that come out on top.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are your issues , US ? The ones that could and will be blown out of proportion ? You need to cut the root of financing for those who scream bloody murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s actually quite simple and sort of a repeat in American history. Communists/Globalists are funding left-wing activists to destroy Western history and society and turn the US away from conservative values and the pillars of society.</p>

<p>This will lead to something similar to the Red Scare when communists funded black rioters.</p>

<p>Black people in America have always been a tool of the bolshevik jew and socialism in general. They are an easy weapon to get white people back into fighting on their own soil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smart people learn from their mistakes, stupid people repeat them</p>

<p>Get ready for a repeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a Croat point of view, you are stretching the narrative so much it pains me a bit to read it.</p>

<p>Like this one for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our weak point (various nationalities with unsloved teritorial and national issues) was taken advantage of, and we were thrown into civil war. I&#39;m saying &#39;thrown&#39; , &#39;cause none of those issues existed or were talked about just 2 years prior to civil war. They were blown out of proportion by &#39;factors&#39; that got rich on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, almost true. The true part is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>various nationalities with unsolved territorial and national issues, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the untrue part is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>none of those issues existed or were talked about just 2 years prior to civil war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without entering into dubious stories and whatnot, the point is that NO, it didn&#39;t take just 2 years for shit to hit the fan, the shit was everywhere since couple centuries ago, or to bring things closer to today, after the death of Tito in &#39;80, everything was gearing up for a violent separation of <em>various nationalities with unsolved territorial and national issues</em>.</p>

<p>Couple things to consider here - Yugoslavia was very much governed from Belgrade, which is the capital of Serbia, and when the Civil war erupted, the Yugoslav army (fyi, in the 70s, Yugoslavia had <strong>the 4th largest infantry force in Europe, 6th largest air force and 5th largest tank force</strong>), was following whatever Belgrade said. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t dive into this shithole of events that happen, but I do get slightly triggered when people say how the war came out of nowhere. It didn&#39;t, was just a matter of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Yugoslavia was as close to a United Southern Slavic State as we were going to get. And as we have seen over time, a united Yugoslavia would be much stronger than the butchered territories that they are now. That inevitable tension came from extremely conservative parties on all fronts. Now everyone wants to &quot;unionize&quot; under the EU, when we already had the solution to a unified south Eastern Europe. If all yugoslavs take some accountability for our history, maybe we could start progressing again past it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the war came out of nowhere. It didn&#39;t, was just a matter of time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I lived in Zagreb in the 60&#39;s and traveled the other states too,  was well aware of the differences and also the differences between religions,  urban/rural,  wealthy/poor,  language,  etc.  and also the memory of history.     Croat nationalists were underground even then.    Tito&#39;s presence seemed to hold it together,    but I still feel that the narrative of the last two years of Yugoslavia is important,  that it took separatist activists being allowed to operate to tear Yugoslavia appart,  and many of these were supported from outside the boundaries of Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>The &quot;inevitable&quot; narrative sadly underplays the facts of how the facts unfolded,  how people who once wanted to hold the country together were overpowered,  often by treachery.    Even a loose federation of independent states would have been better than dividing the country and watching parts become NATO pawns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You support my contention elsewhere that Yugoslavia was <em>intentionally</em> formed to corral opposing groups together under a <em>strongman</em>, and that anyone could have predicted what would happen when the top-down-directed &quot;unity&quot; went away.</p>

<p>Colonial powers have been doing this kind of thing forever. Observe how they partitioned first Africa, then the &quot;Middle East&quot;, intentionally drawing up &#39;countries&#39; with multiple incompatible tribes and cultures. That prevents any forming of a sizable <em>opponent to the colonial power</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to go edit wikipedia, &#39;cause it says otherwise:</p>

<p>&quot;
A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology,[1] is a war between organized groups within the same state or country. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies.</p>

<p>A civil war is a high-intensity conflict, often involving regular armed forces, that is sustained, organized and large-scale. Civil wars may result in large numbers of casualties and the consumption of significant resources.[3] Most modern civil wars involve intervention by outside powers.

    <div class="md"><p>The former &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; was a <em>proposition &#39;nation&#39;</em>. The proposition was top-down control by a &#39;strongman&#39;; first Stalin, then Tito. When the strongman departed, everyone resumed being what they were before, <strong>squabbling ethnicities</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Actual</em> nations are out of favor in the current year. Their elements (common culture, heritage and origin) are disparaged, and lately all but criminalized, and when that happens you get either straight-up <strong>ethnic militias</strong>, or herds of dupes like Antifa, BLM and the &#39;Alt-Right&#39;. </p>

<p>Short of Mengele-level Eugenics, <em>real humans</em> aren&#39;t going to merge into a homogenized soup. They evolved over millennia from too many dietary, climatic and geographic points of origin.</p>

<p>&quot;Proposition nations&quot; have <em>no unifying elements</em> beyond their <em>narratives, backed by the &#39;strongman&#39;</em>. I named the strongmen in Yugoslavia above; in the U.S. we have &#39;The Swamp&#39; and its billions of hollow-points. One might as well pledge &quot;allegiance&quot; to Comcast or the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

<p>Other, harder cultures are watching, just like they were in Yugoslavia.</p>
