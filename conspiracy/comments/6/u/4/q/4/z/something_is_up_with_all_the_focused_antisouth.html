<p>There is a definite concerted effort to use inflammatory terms about the south, and anyone who might object to these memorials being taken down - </p>

<ul>
<li>Losers</li>
<li>Traitors - (I see this one everywhere)</li>
<li>White supremacist</li>
<li>Nazis</li>
</ul>

<p>The conflation is rampant, the terms are antagonistic, and consistent. Very few are interested in calm discussion. I feel like the pot is being intentionally stirred here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What it is, is a flipping and warping of history by TPTB. Technically, the South were more patriotic to the Republic than the North were. After the civil war, we turn into a Corporation owned by bankers, which is really what &quot;keeping the union together&quot; was all about. What we are seeing are a reemerging &quot;rebel&quot; movements, and the TPTB have to nip it bud while we enter the Great Awakening/Unveiling. We live in a topsy turvy world were down is up and left is right. Nothing make sense anymore in our constant state of confusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lee, Jackson and Longstreet were against slavery. Nobody even knows that. That&#39;s how fucked up revisionist history is. They are far from the primary villains of the war...people should try the corrupt politicians of the era and the British throne who actually instigated the conflict to tear apart the country so it could be reconquered. </p>

<p>They fought because they were career military men and loyal to their state, a concept nobody understands now, and the south was invaded by a northern army...which they considered a foreign invasion, and they were ordered to defend their state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok...how simple are you? I&#39;m tired of playing nice. I said &quot;conflate&quot; do you know what that means? Let me spell out my point for your obvious trolling, willful or not - </p>

<p>Commenters are conflating any and all southerners who might have any issue with the removal of these memorials for any reason, with the neo-Nazis who have chosen to take up this issue on their own.</p>

<p>By conflating the two groups, they are attempting to shame the larger, non-neo-Nazi group in to shutting up, or tricking them in to a no-win argument trying to prove they aren&#39;t Nazis. (Proving a negative is highly difficult to impossible) - and just a distraction anyway.</p>

<p>Clear enough for you now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t wade into the comments on mainstream political subs enough to comment on your assertion that <em>any and all</em> people who are pro-monument are being conflated with Nazis, but the Charlottesville rally was organized by a white nationalist explicitly as a white nationalist protest. It wasn&#39;t a mainstream conservative event that got ruined by a few bad eggs. If you don&#39;t want to be generalized as a Nazi, don&#39;t show up to their events. And if you share a strong concerns with Nazis, perhaps you should be taking a step back and examining your beliefs. </p>
