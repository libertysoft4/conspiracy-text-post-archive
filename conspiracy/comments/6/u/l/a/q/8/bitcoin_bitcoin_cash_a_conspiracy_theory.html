        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is a recent excerpt from Jeff Berwick...</p>

<p>BITCOIN &amp; BITCOIN CASH - A CONSPIRACY THEORY</p>

<p>I think there is a reasonably likely conspiracy theory to do with Bitcoin and its most recent fork.</p>

<p>As many know, many of the core bitcoin developers work for a company called Blockstream. Developers
include Adam Back (President, Blockstream), Gregory Maxwell (CTO, Blockstream), Mark Friedenbach
(Co-founder, Blockstream), Pieter Wuille (Bitcoin Core developer), Samson Mow (CSO), and Christopher
Allen (co-author of IETF Transport Layer Security.</p>

<p>What many may not be aware of is that Blockstream is controlled by the Bilderberg Group. AXA Strategic
Ventures, co-lead investor for Blockstream&#39;s $55 million financing round, is the investment arm of French
insurance giant AXA Group - whose CEO Henri de Castries has been Chairman of the Bilderberg Group since
2012.</p>

<p>At the same time, the most popular Bitcoin reddit, <a href="/r/Bitcoin">/r/Bitcoin</a> , has become almost completely censored in the
last few years and only allows pro-Blockstream related content.</p>

<p>Blockstream has been resistant to the common sense idea of increasing the Bitcoin block size for years. And
this makes perfect sense in that Blockstream’s entire business model is based on creating sidechains which
profit from a slow or expensive Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Finally, some people, including Roger Ver had had enough of this takeover of Bitcoin and thus we have the
hard fork and Bitcoin Cash today.</p>

<p>THE CONSPIRACY THEORY</p>

<p>This all gets quite complicated and I won’t bore you with all the details (but I will include lots of links for
more information for those of you who want to understand this on a deep level).</p>

<p>But, here is the theory I have come up with in a nutshell.</p>

<p>We know the globalists want to destroy bitcoin. And, we know they can’t do it via their traditional means of
sending in government thugs to kill, arrest and steal everything because there is no one central point of
failure for bitcoin.</p>

<p>So, if they did want to try to destroy bitcoin what would they do?
First they would try to employ as many of the most prominent bitcoin coders. Check.</p>

<p>Then they’d want to try to control the narrative which, for bitcoin, has been centered at <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a>, where they
now appear to have complete censorship powers against anything competing with Blockstream’s proposals.
Check.</p>

<p>They’d then want to subterfugely get code implemented into bitcoin which is a) irreversible and b) a ticking
timebomb for BTC’s destruction.</p>

<p>Well, we don’t know yet, but that is exactly what Segwit could be.</p>

<p>As I said, I am not going to include pages of information supporting this theory in this issue as it would get
into the hundreds of pages. Instead, I will leave you links to further information.</p>

<p>First, here is a blockchain techie, modprobe, and his concerns about Segwit, <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@modprobe/i-looked-into-segwit-and-here-s-what-i-saw">“I Looked Into SegWit, and
Here&#39;s What I Saw .”</a></p>

<p>Here are some of the most pertinent items he mentioned:</p>

<p>There are two major implications to this hack. The first is that segwit is a one-way ticket: once it
starts, it can never be removed because to remove the (insanely complicated) segwit rules that say &quot;Ignore what the transaction says and look at the witness data instead&quot; would leave only the &quot;anyone can spend me without any authorization&quot; rule on all segwit balances. Thus anyone could steal all the coins in segwit balances. To remove segwit, it would either be necessary to keep the (insanely complicated) rules in play, but disallow new transactions to use them, or convince all Bitcoin users to first move their bitcoins to a non-segwit balance. The first isn&#39;t really removing segwit, since its rules would still be in use, and the second is simply not going to happen since segwit
proponents will lie and censor (just like they&#39;re doing now to promote segwit) to scare people away from leaving it behind.
The second implication is even more chilling: for the first time, the Bitcoin protocol will have official support for theft of bitcoins. See, the formal rules of bitcoin will be &quot;anyone can spend these coins
without authorization,&quot; but the segwit rules will say otherwise. This means that anyone who can get a majority of miners to agree to look the other way (i.e. ignore the segwit rules) can send a transaction that spends those bitcoins without authorization, and it will be valid by protocol. At present, if the majority of miners attempted to do this, their blocks would be invalid (and ignored by the network) because they violate the Bitcoin protocol, but with segwit, the Bitcoin protocol will only understand &quot;anyone can spend these coins&quot; so as long as the miners agree to ignore the segwit rules, the transaction will pass checks. Obviously this means that the miners could collude to steal everyone&#39;s segwit balances, but more likely, a government could force mining organizations to allow their transactions to steal bitcoins, reverse transactions, or whatever else. Whereas previously
this meddling would&#39;ve been extremely noisy, causing a hard fork (which would have likely been ignored). With segwit, however, theft by miner collusion is a first class feature. </p>

<p>For those who prefer their information in video format rather than text, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO176mdSTG0">here is an excellent presentation</a> on the problems with Segwit from the Chief Scientist for Bitcoin Unlimited, Peter Rizun.</p>

<p>To summarize, one could imagine a few scenarios where Segwit had major problems or resulted in the loss/hack/theft of the majority of bitcoins… which would be a virtual death knell for bitcoin. And, yes, it is possible this is being done on purpose.</p>

<p>Segwit will begin to be implemented in about two weeks.</p>

<p>A further “conspiracy theory” is that those behind Bitcoin Cash are doing so as a means to take over control of
bitcoin.
Here is a good article by bellerophon on Steemit, <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@belerophon/the-black-swan-that-could-turn-bitcoin-upside-down">“The Black Swan That Could Turn Bitcoin Upside Down.”</a></p>

<p>In it he posits that Bitcoin Cash has been set-up in such a way that miners, out of self-interest, will switch from bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash mining in the coming weeks… which would cause a crash in Bitcoin and spike in Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<p>And yet another more obscure and anonymous theory was posted <a href="https://pastebin.com/n0aGBMQr">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet from this theory:</p>

<p>The plan goes like this:
Chinese miners (f2pool, antpool etc etc) have organised with major exchanges (via/huobi/okcoin
etc) to support and launch bitcoin cash.
Initially they will let everyone who wants to sell, sell.
Once the coin has bottomed out, and everyone who wanted to sell has sold, they [chinese
miners/jihad/chinese exchanges] will begin accumulating lots and lots of bitcoin cash.
They will then begin to pump the price to around 0.1 BCC/BTC - 10%
The big pools won&#39;t mine it ~ they will let the smaller pools see the returns from mining this
expensive, but low difficulty coin and start mining it.
Later, the larger pools will join, and as we know, jihad has ALOT of hashing power, their plan is for
bitcoin cash to have more hashing power than bitcoin ~ and lets be honest, once the chinese move
over, that is pretty much it.
Around this time, the &#39;hard fork&#39; section of segwit 2x is not going to happen ~ it never was - Bitcoin
cash will then be seen as the original NYA coin.
At that point in time, Bitcoin cash will be on all major chinese exchanges, possibly some western
exchanges aswell, and have majority hashing power. Western companies &amp; other merchant
providers (BitPay - @Spair) etc - paid off by bitmain etc will go along with the new bitcoin cash
narrative and will push for the &#39;bitcoin cash&#39; to be called &#39;bitcoin&#39; on all their platforms, leaving only
coinbase et all which will then be the odd ones out..
Now comes the scary part, The old bitcoin, the bitcoin we know and love, is going to get
DESTROYED.</p>

<p>As you can see this is a lot to consider… and worry about if you own bitcoin!</p>

<p>For this reason I have suggested all those who held bitcoin on August 1st and received Bitcoin Cash hold on to
it for at least the time being.</p>

<p>If any of the above theories play out you’ll be very happy you did. And if none of them play out and Bitcoin
Cash goes the way of the Dodo bird it was really ‘free money” anyway.</p>

<p>And, that’s not to mention that if Blockstream continues to make bitcoin more expensive to use that Bitcoin
Cash could end up being the currency of choice for day-to-day transactions while legacy bitcoin could be used
more as a store of digital wealth and not for microtransactions.</p>

<p>So, it is definitely worth just holding on to your Bitcoin Cash for now.</p>

<p>That leaves the question, should you buy Bitcoin Cash? At the time of this writing it is at $320 and a $5
billion market cap.</p>

<p>It is too early to say how Bitcoin Cash will do so if you do want to buy consider it very speculative.</p>

<p>That said, as you’ll see below, from Ed Bugos, from a strictly free market perspective he is a fan of Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, bitcoin is trading near $3,300 and Bitcoin Cash near $300 for a combined total of
$3,600… meaning any/all TDV subscribers who owned bitcoin prior to August 1st have all done very well in
recent weeks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your conspiracy is that the Bitcoin white paper was written by a pseudonym who then later handed control over the project or rather Bitcoin Core to his own selected few. Now if there is indeed a conspiracy with blockstream then there is a conspiracy with BTC to begin with. Better to start a new currency, no? Or rather yet if you truly believe BTC is to be bad protest digital currency rather than supporting something else.</p>

<p>The BTC protocol is solid and is only vulnerable to one attack. That is a hard fork that actually splits the network in half. That of which is what you are doing. I do hope clever youngsters figure out what is what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does that not follow? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re scared of Blockstream and their &quot;developers&quot; and thus the head of Bitcoin Core (Software is based off of the whitepaper and was the only worked on project by the author of the Bitcoin whitepaper) which Bitcoin Cash is going against then you would then therefore not be trusting &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot;s judgement. Whoever he/she may be. I would think that if he/she took the effort to keep their real name hidden with a pseudonym then they would take the same amount of time picking out a suitable candidate to follow his/her vision for Bitcoin. So if you&#39;re scared of Blockstream then you&#39;re basically stating that you no longer believe &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot;s selected candidates are able to uphold the vision of Bitcoin. Sure maybe this is reaching, but the irony of all of this is you are most likely not a developer. Whereas they are and I am as well. Have you read the initial published Bitcoin whitepaper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t prove a negative. The onus is on you. You just said because it&#39;s inception is surrounded by an anonymous creator conspiracy that the subversion of Bitcoins development is also a part of the same conspiracy by mere association which is complete rubbish.</p>

<p>Dude Craig Wright cryptographically proved himself to be Satoshi to a handful of people already. And Craig Wright publicly stated he would support the cash hardfork, his company Nchain being the #1 theory behind the mystery miner. Satoshi chose the fork.</p>

<p>Vitalik is full of shit though, because he seems to not understand the weight of the situation and possibly even the outright danger Wright would be putting himself in if he did it publicly.</p>

<p>I have a firm grasp of the Segwit situation and it is clearly the wrong move, sacrificing higher network error for a marginal gain by solving transactional malleability which could be dealt with cleaner and less ridiculously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know as well as I do there would be serious bureaucratic and even psychological trauma involved with publicly outing yourself as Satoshi. Gavin even mentioned this regarding that meeting.</p>

<p>Anyway man, look, the way I see it is that Segwit is a deliberate attempt by the banking class to destroy Bitcoin. It is going to fail because of the beauty of Bitcoins design. If you have $600 odd bucks lying around I don&#39;t think you will be able to buy true Bitcoin again for this price and there are only going to be 21,000,000 of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you actually read it, though? It is SegWit that is against it. Satoshi already explained everything about the blocksize increase, there was not even a limit to begin with, it was put later to avoid a network attack, until the network was more secure by having more miners and hashrate, meaning that it was never meant to hit the limit and it had to be raised along as technology advanced with more efficient data storage equipment like he literally explained in his emails. </p>

<p>And all you said about &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&#39;s selected candidates&quot; is also a blatant lie. Do you even know who was actually designated to be Bitcoin Core&#39;s Lead Developer? Gavin was. Oh and guess what, Gavin got kicked out of it, because he didn&#39;t support Blockstream&#39;s view, and not only him, but literally every other Core developer that agreed with Satoshi&#39;s original plan, to raise the blocksize limit, were also kicked one by one. Coincidence...? So yeah, it&#39;s not the people that &quot;Satoshi wanted&quot; anymore. It&#39;s what Blockstream wanted. </p>

<p>And it gets even fishier because they decided to act (fund Blockstream) exactly after they noticed &quot;Satoshi&quot; was gone. Blockstream realized they could do anything and he wouldn&#39;t act because he&#39;s not there anymore.</p>

Seems like the sort of position they give to people who play ball while they are in influential positions. </p>
