<p>You do not get a choice. That is called life. Even if they have ways to vet people for racism, people can just lie. Once again, that is life. If you&#39;re looking for a Utopia here on Earth, you&#39;ll never find it. You might as well just go live out in seclusion.</p>

<p>And yes it is illegal. I know this from personal experiences because I used to work in the real estate world and had to deal with law suits.</p>

<p>And no one is taking about some racism detector or vetting. It&#39;s about preventing racial discrimination from happening in the first place by first acknowledging that everyone is a bit racist in some shape or form, and then learn how to reduce racism and discrimination against others as much as possible.</p>

<p>For example, I heard an interview with a black police officer who thought racism and discrimination against black people from police was almost non existent. Until he learned that after some reflection, he realized that even though he&#39;s black, he treats black suspects much worse than white suspects.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called implicit racial bias, and it&#39;s something that we can do to reduce its effect on others.</p>

<p>Not possible with humans. By that statement of yours, let me guess you are a Marxist?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he realized that even though he&#39;s black, he treats black suspects much worse than white suspects.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because statistically Blacks commit more crime. He&#39;s a smart man, for realizing that, even though he himself is Black. Hard pill to swallow.</p>

<p>This is not something that could be forced on Americans, the trick was to make them beg for it in a morally indignant outrage, and &#39;nazis&#39; were the perfect trigger.</p>
