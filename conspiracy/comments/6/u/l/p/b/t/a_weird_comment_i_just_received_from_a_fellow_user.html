<p>This is information collected on you from ad algorithms and other various data collecting scripts, this is why it says you have a daughter, a son, an ex husband, born in cali, your Christian, you like to discuss addictions, recovery, and politics, the posts I provided are also from SnoopSnoo, I provided the link to your lowest rated comment, as seen on Snoop. </p>

<p>The fact is, this information is being given by you, to them, you agreed to the TOS (did you read it?), which allows them to collect data on you. </p>

<p>No one is tracking anyone. </p>

<p>I talk about dragon ball super, cute fish, supplements, etc, the fact is I am trying to tell you this thread is submitted inappropriately to the incorrect subreddit, and your trying to defend it by using me as an example, when I am simply trying to educate you girl. </p>

<p>The fact is, you agreed to the websites TOS, EVERYONE WHO AGREED TO IT SHOULD KNOW ITS HAPPENING.</p>

<p>&quot;I disagree that we shouldn&#39;t keep this crap on the open.&quot;</p>

<p>Then start mating alternate/throwaway accounts every 1-3 months if you are concerned with being &quot;stalked&quot;.</p>

<p>I know I come off as a dick, but I am going to tell you honestly how it is, I am not going to let you pretend that I am a bad guy here for trying to educate you on basic shit. </p>

<p>Smarten the fuck up and act your god damn age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who runs a subreddit, it&#39;s just pathetic they are unable to enforce the rules they themselves have in place. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ulpbt/a_weird_comment_i_just_received_from_a_fellow_user/dltu36b/">This is a wonderful explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Atm, waiting on Dragon Ball super, and just finished watching GOT s07e06, waiting to see if episode 7 gets leaked as well. </p>

<p>As a Russian, you should know better to tell someone to get a life.</p>

<p>But your payed to do this, look at the main subreddits you hang out on : <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/u/FartOnToast">https://snoopsnoo.com/u/FartOnToast</a></p>

<p>People like you need to be a little bit more logical and actually read what is said. </p>

<p>Your obviously a person who has a hard time understanding there are rules in this world, and there are rules to subreddits, when a group of mods ignore the rules, and ignore material that does not belong, it bothers me. </p>

<p>Go suck a dick. </p>

<p>Does you family know of what you do and how you think? or do you keep that secret/feel shame? If they do how do they feel about it? Is the local economy where you live in that poor of shape that the only occupations obtainable are ones where you have to resign your intelligence and morality at the door?? </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t really feel like going back and going through any PMs to see what this troll or that troll said to me.  It&#39;s all fucking stupid really.  I&#39;m passed it.  Sucks as it stands.  I don&#39;t feel like being reminded of how stupid this or that basement-dweller is.</p>
