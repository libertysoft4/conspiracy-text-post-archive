    <div class="md"><p>Alright 
I&#39;m definitely all for people eating psychedelics but what a lot of people don&#39;t understand is how powerful they are and it&#39;s not just a &quot;super fun time! Gunna see all shorts of crazy things wow!!&quot;
They can tear your  mind apart if you don&#39;t know what you are doing or how they will affect you so before you decide to eat anything!
Do some research into whatever it is you decided to take and set and setting Is a big thing and be careful! Psychedelics aren&#39;t a party drug and shouldn&#39;t be seen as such and don&#39;t expect to take something and have all the answers of the universe be revealed to you that&#39;s not how it works 
That is all I have to say about that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Second this. </p>

<p>Psychedelics are not to be abused or underestimated. I will only say do your personal research, find your inner peace first (or learn what a bad trip is), smoke two joints before you do anything strong so you can ease yourself into it. </p>

<p>Really though, let&#39;s not disrespect the forbidden fruits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i did normal doses (50-250 mics) for a long time, and felt invincible. like i could take any dose and be fine. &quot;bad trip&quot; was something that just could not happen to me. i felt like a god. (i was young and dumb, only 18) . so one night i took 250 mic and a few hours in i felt invincible so i decided to take 3 more tabs, and well, that was a mistake that i struggled for 5 years to cope with (benzos every day) and now it has been 15 years and im still not ok.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks but I&#39;ve done this. I bought every known supplement in the years after to try and rehabilitate. 5htp worked best on depression but not long term. After a short while it stopped working. I guess the only thing I haven&#39;t tried is vit c. But I&#39;m not thinking it could somehow magically rehabilitate 15 years after the fact. Am i wrong? </p>

<p>it could, vit C deficiency is a big deal. what else are you currently taking? </p>

<p>you should be taking magnesium daily regardless, most adults are deficient, vit D (5oooiu/day) unless you are getting daily sun exposure (with vitK), zinc.  Supplements can be tricky at times, you need good ones along with the proper dose and some need companion supplements in order to work.  I had years of dealing with crappy brands and not taking high enough doses so I though most of the shit I took didn&#39;t work but come to find out I just did it wrong. </p>

<p>Diet is a pretty big factor for many people have you fiddled with your foods? </p>

<p>All non-violent drug offenders in prison today are political prisoners. This Nixon aide even admitted they just used it as an excuse to target racial minorities and hippies. They&#39;re incarcerated because they MIGHT be a political threat to the corrupt government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely support hallucinogens as a way to circumvent our society&#39;s negativity. Just be mindful of set and setting so you don&#39;t have a bad experience. That being said, the most beneficial trips I have taken in my life have almost all been &#39;bad trips&#39;. They are uncomfortable, but rapid positive change in your outlook is rarely a pleasant experience. </p>

<p>Although some would disagree with me, I believe DMT is the best first psychedelic. It is fast coming up and within 10 minutes you are back in a semi normal mindset (albeit with some nice afterglow). Not to mention if it is smoked correctly you experience ego death almost instantaneously so there is no &#39;you&#39; to be afraid or anxious. </p>

<p>Mushrooms seem to be the most common first trip. What most don&#39;t expect from them is the profoundly spiritual and introspective experience that they offer. As many other responses here state, hallucinogens should not be viewed as a &#39;party drug&#39;. Rather they should be viewed as a tool for unlocking new perspectives and removing mental blocks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I first did shrooms when I was 19 (28 now) while I always questioned the world around me it wasn&#39;t until this time you really experience that humans are in the dark to a lot of truths. Since then I&#39;ve done lsd mushrooms and dmt many times and all have their values  (no cactuses unfortunately) mushrooms will connect you to the earth and life and remove your ego. It will take you to where you need to go and help you work through issues in your life by facing yourself. Lsd while intense I find more easily controllable in the way mushrooms just &quot;take you where you need to go&quot; I would not suggest doing dmt without any prior experience as it is many levels above what these others offer unless you do large doses. All in all the idea is that these drugs/plants have been used by humans since we found them. And there&#39;s a reason for that. The drug wars main purpose is to keep your mind shut down.  One of the biggest fights is to stop the government from telling us what we can think/injest. A heightened consciousness and awareness along with coordination and unity is the deep states worst enemy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mushrooms are safer than a lot of drugs, but &quot;safest&quot;? MDMA and LSD are much safer than people realize too, but there are even safer recreational drugs. Like cannabis, for one. Those psychedelics and MDMA can be safe, but cannabis is even safer, impossible to overdose on, with less risk of discomfort from a &quot;bad trip&quot;. Recreational use of caffeine is generally very safe too, although it is actually possible to overdose on that one and even die from it. Tobacco and alcohol are definitely less safe than all of those though. </p>
