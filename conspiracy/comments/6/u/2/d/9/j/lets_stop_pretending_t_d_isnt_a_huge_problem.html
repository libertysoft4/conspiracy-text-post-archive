        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I get it. Trump was the underdog. Trump was the anti-establishment pick, at least he was by the time we got down to final nominations. Trump is constantly under fire from sources that we consider to be part of the establishment, helping him to maintain underdog status.</p>

<p>But can we talk about r/The_Donald and their deep, aggressive love for censorship? Can we talk about the fact that I left a non-profane, simple comment that questioned what defense was left for them to make at this point, and was <em>immediately</em> (within ten minutes of leaving the comment) banned from the sub and received a mocking message from the mods? Can we talk about the fact that main posts in there cannot be downvoted so that they can continue to force their way into r/all?</p>

<p>The_Donald is a propaganda machine, a dangerous one. This sub loves to talk about how r/politics, r/news, etc. have all fallen to the interests of the left, and yet somehow there exists a massive community on reddit in which one of the <strong>rules of the sub</strong> is that you are not allowed to criticize the President. Really think about that. Where in places like politics and news, criticizing the left might be met with a flurry of downvotes, in T_D, criticizing the President is met with a <em>ban</em>.</p>

<p>They know that they need it to be a pure echo chamber. Echo chambers generate fervor, they are self-reinforcing loops of emotion that depend heavily on confirmation bias -- and with Trump, the line of reasoning helping to maintain the fervor-generator is so incredibly weak that <em>they cannot allow for disagreement itself</em>.</p>

<p>I have to say, recently I&#39;ve been really disappointed with this sub and the way that it is handling the presidency. But I would <em>never</em> expect to be banned from this sub for expressing a thought that went against the grain, and THAT IS THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS SUB. This is the place where anti-establishment thoughts may be shared openly, picked apart, analyzed for their true validity.</p>

<p>In the sidebar, I see that I am being asked to sign a petition to stop Google&#39;s censorship of the internet. I ask you -- why stop there? Why not place a heavily censored subreddit like T_D in our crosshairs too? Why do we criticize one echo chamber but then ignore another?</p>

<p>He&#39;s not the underdog anymore. He is the President. Stop drinking the fucking Kool-Aid already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The exclusion of r/politics truly ruins a good analysis idea.</p>

<p>Also, the waves of t_d vs r/politics seem to differ a bit.  T_d brigades seem to get spammy, kinda blanket bombing a topic throughout a day(s), waiting for something to stick, then drive it home.</p>

<p>r/politics brigades tend to show up en masse, using more of a brute force tactic, manipulating votes and comments early and often, &quot;forcing&quot; a particular post to rise to the top.  They leave a lingering wave of narrative themed posts over the next day or so, too.  And god forbid, if one of their msm outlets releases something even <em>slightly</em> incriminating against Trump, they will spam, invade, attack, brigade, no holds barred try to burn down this sub.  The &quot;pissgate* fiasco was one of the most absurd sustained brigades I&#39;ve seen.  &quot;But.. but.. It&#39;s the greatest conspiracy of our lifetimes!!!  Reeeeeeee!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Both forms are irritating, but I tend to give t_d <em>slightly</em> more of a pass, since they&#39;re part of an overwhelming minority on Reddit, and their brigading tactics aren&#39;t as brutish and transparent.  Sure, they may be mostly bots and morons, but who am I to judge :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see.  I made it about halfway, long enough to see him justify excluding r/politics, and it wasn&#39;t in his first set of numbers.  Honest mistake.  I don&#39;t have the interest in digging through all the comments, since I have other studies to pursue today.</p>

<p>This whole Nazi scare thing is just baffling to me.  It&#39;s so artificial and forced, I just don&#39;t see any organic hysteria here.  Between wannabe SJW&#39;s spamming their Nazi freakouts, and righties twisting logic on <em>any</em> detail to make it look like a false flag, it&#39;s just... weird.  And now there&#39;s this whole &quot;if you don&#39;t agree with us you&#39;re a natzi too!&quot; theme.  Strange times.</p>

<p>I think that whether it&#39;s a true &quot;false flag&quot;, or not, the whole situation is a media driven frenzy, causing people on both sides (mostly left, though) to turn into raving lunatics.  It&#39;s sad to see people be driven apart so easily, over such a contrived event.  </p>

<p>Yes.  We get it.  Natzi racists are bad.  Antifa fascists are bad.  Let&#39;s just stop getting sucked into staged events, forcing us to pick sides to hate, and turn our attention to the real murdering, racist fascists in Washington and MSM.</p>

<p>They were created to attack Macron before the French elections with the fake leaked documents, then later they came back with Seth Rich and democrat posts. They were getting called out then started to copy comments over from T_D to create some bot hysteria.</p>

<p>There were a few posts about this including a stickied one in which mods commented saying they wouldn&#39;t ban them (and I can&#39;t see any bans in the log). But at least one person sent the admins a message and they shadowbanned the accounts.</p>

<p>Banning subs because they have different political ideologies is stupid and only would create an even bigger echo chamber on reddit. </p>

<p>I would much rather see stupid posts like this toned down and disappear. We could use this &quot;everyone against trump&quot; a little less. You&#39;re carrying water for corporate democrats who rigged their own primary and cheated the country out of a progressive. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give two shits about T_D, I care about this United propaganda effort that you&#39;re spreading whether knowingly or unknowingly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I post to 2 subreddits. T_D and this one.</p>

<p>I used to come here quite a bit on my old account before the election. It used to be pretty sweet. Lots of quality 9/11 posts. Lots of discussion on false flags, psychedelics, alien intelligence, mind control, psychic phenomena, all kinds of rad shit. You guys would post videos that would blow my mind. Yeah, i&#39;d even watch the 7 hour long insane shit you guys would link.</p>

<p>But since the election and very recently, a lot of really dark and evil shit has come to light. Really bad shit involving he deep state, pedo rings, treasonous activity and real earthly human type bad shit.</p>

<p>Something has changed with this board and its because the bad people who engage in the real conspiracies want to contaminate this board and derail the <strong>true shit</strong> you guys find and create and post here.</p>

<p>And its working.</p>

<p>Attacking T_D isnt helpful. Why even mention it? There are people who voted for Trump and go on T_D who actually do come to this board, and when a Trump supporting conspiracy buff learns about some really messed up shit, they will come here and post or comment. There is a LOT of REAL CONSPIRACY going on RIGHT NOW. For people like me who want truth and to expose conspiracies and who spend lots of time here and on /pol/ and other places ... people like me who just honestly are addicted to information and reading &quot;the news&quot; constantly, we just want to be able to participate.</p>

<p>So, yeah, there are more threads about Seth, the DNC, fucking Iran, Russia, the CIA, etc. Dude, its <em>what&#39;s happening right now</em>.</p>

<p>Lots of shills come on this board to derail actual discussion. Don&#39;t believe in ShareBlue or CTR? Or is that another T_D exclusive conspiracy?</p>

<p>Bernie was fucked out of being the DNC nom. We know this from wikileaks.</p>

<p>The clintons <em>fucking kill people</em>.</p>

<p>This is fucking really happening and its an actual fucking conspiracy.</p>

<p>So, yeah, this shit takes up a lot of my time. And it probably will for some time. Its no different than people who obsess over chemtrails or fucking antarctica or reptilians.</p>

<p>Whatever. Can&#39;t we just focus on discussing <strong>conspiracies</strong> instead of fighting over who may or may not post in T_D?</p>

<p>god damn</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, the same exact thing happens in many pro-Hillary and other leftist subreddits. They&#39;re allowed to do what they want in their own thread. The majority of political subreddits are echo chambers and are that way by design. I frequent the donald, I also frequent late stage capitalism, politics, political humor, communism, and other subreddits to get an idea. Most of the people in the donald are normal people sick of identity politics and the establishment left. Then there are a decent number of crazies too. But that&#39;s true of every political subreddit. Just don&#39;t let it bother you. You say, &quot;I have to say, recently I&#39;ve been really disappointed with this sub and the way that it is handling the presidency. But I would never expect to be banned from this sub for expressing a thought that went against the grain, and THAT IS THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS SUB. This is the place where anti-establishment thoughts may be shared openly, picked apart, analyzed for their true validity.&quot; but that&#39;s the scope of this sub. The donald is literally a pro trump subreddit, so they have rules against anything that&#39;s not that stance, and there&#39;s many dozens of other sites where you can debate them. There&#39;s even ask the donald for the exact purpose of asking them questions. I think a lot of it has to also do with brigading, which has happened a lot to them because everyone on reddit hates them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I visit T_D, pol, here and all kind of conflicting sites. I am Australian and I like Trump. I understand some of what you say but it&#39;s not all that way. There came a time where reddit censored T_D from /all and /popular and that is on going. There were times where T_D would not show on my top bar but politics has not one time in over a year not been there. T_D is dealing with site wide censorship and are doing what they can to get their shit seen, in my humble opinion. I post in T_D and comment in politics but only ever see T_D censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see.  I made it about halfway, long enough to see him justify excluding r/politics, and it wasn&#39;t in his first set of numbers.  Honest mistake.  I don&#39;t have the interest in digging through all the comments, since I have other studies to pursue today.</p>

<p>This whole Nazi scare thing is just baffling to me.  It&#39;s so artificial and forced, I just don&#39;t see any organic hysteria here.  Between wannabe SJW&#39;s spamming their Nazi freakouts, and righties twisting logic on <em>any</em> detail to make it look like a false flag, it&#39;s just... weird.  And now there&#39;s this whole &quot;if you don&#39;t agree with us you&#39;re a natzi too!&quot; theme.  Strange times.</p>

<p>I think that whether it&#39;s a true &quot;false flag&quot;, or not, the whole situation is a media driven frenzy, causing people on both sides (mostly left, though) to turn into raving lunatics.  It&#39;s sad to see people be driven apart so easily, over such a contrived event.  </p>

<p>Yes.  We get it.  Natzi racists are bad.  Antifa fascists are bad.  Let&#39;s just stop getting sucked into staged events, forcing us to pick sides to hate, and turn our attention to the real murdering, racist fascists in Washington and MSM.</p>

<p>He completely missed where it says that plain as day in the screenshot. </p>
