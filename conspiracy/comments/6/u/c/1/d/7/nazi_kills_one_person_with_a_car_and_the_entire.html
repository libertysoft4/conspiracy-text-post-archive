<p>Muslim kills 13 people with a car and gets into a shootout with police. 1 post on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> from worldnews. No other posts about the incident, infact right now there are 3 posts on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> about the &quot;Nazi&quot; narrative, with only one post about this attack. All the people denouncing &quot;hateful ideology&quot; so loudly only a day ago are strangely quiet about this hateful ideology. Surely every politician will line up to denounce this? Surely this will be the subject of every late night show tonight? Will the media push for all muslims to answer for this ideology like they did with white people only a few days ago?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying that the MSM <em>does not</em> have an agenda in regards to Islam? Have you been living under a rock? There is an active campaign to say: #NotAllMuslims. With the Charlottesville incident, they are propagating basically all white conservatives are fascist neo-nazis, and that racism is <strong>everywhere</strong>. Even though, we had a Black president for 8 damn years. If you cannot see the agenda, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re a lost cause. Open your eyes, and step outside of bias.</p>

<p>Pretty indifferent to the color of his skin, I&#39;d say. Most were pissed off at his ideology and political views, not too mention the shit he passed while in office.  I&#39;m one of those people.</p>

        Why would Poles emigrate to the dirty, Brown filled, country, that is UK -&gt; **however, this was your post, which was quoted by the poster u/ooh-eeh-ooh-ah-ahh20**

    Well, you should ask them, because hundreds of thousands of them already have emigrated there.

<p>Also, if you think that all conservatives shouldn&#39;t be blamed for the racism they are allowing to flourish within their own party, why do you think that the idea of #NotAllMuslims is some sort of agenda?  It&#39;s saying <em>exactly the same thing</em> that not all of a particular group (conservatives, muslims) are responsible or should be blamed for the actions of a few radicals (nazi terrorists, islamist terrorists).</p>

<p>Also, having a black president doesn&#39;t get rid of racism.  If anything, it mobilized white supremacists, made them more politically active.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking that. I found myself thinking Monday &quot;wow, he might not have meant it but what he said was good for us to come together as a country&quot; then he scheduled a press conference on his own, he had prepared remarks on infrastructure and then completely just started ranting about it. It is no way this man is that dumb. Like I can&#39;t even say I&#39;m mad, it&#39;s more a mix between confusing and a &quot;wtf&quot; this can not be real feeling&quot; like this has to be either a distraction or a ploy to divide the nation for some reason.  Trump supporters keep saying how Trump is the great negotiator and is the man of the people but in all the years of my life, I have literally not once felt more divided as a country. This has to be part of a bigger plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ave you read the Felix Sater story? He is a Russian born real estate developer and property management director and advisor to Trumps organization. He negotiated a lot of things on behalf of Trump and has very close ties to Trump so hes not some rando. He is claiming that he and his family are preparing for him to go to jail and is confident Trump will join him. He says that he has been working with Mueller and is under an NDA but said it&#39;s mostly money laundering and financial crimes tied with the Russian mob. He said he expects to be sentenced this fall and the last timeline he gave said 30-35 days. The story was first published August 3rd. Maybe this is it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I did not see those tweets yet. The Papapopolous guy or how ever you sell it seems like someone who is at the heart of this big thing. I think this weekend I&#39;m going to compile a list of all the shit going on, and make it pretty big coherent post. It seems like when we get a story a week it doesn&#39;t look suspicious by itself, and I understand why people don&#39;t read into it if they think it&#39;s no evidence, but when putting it into context and actually reading through all of this shit, and connecting the obvious dots I have no clue how people think that this is a nothing burger.

<p>I only don&#39;t follow it, aside from what I come across, because I know better than to expect substantial leaks and I want the full picture. Some people have this strange expectation that everything will be leaked/released just because it has happened with some other things - although much of that false equivalence / unrealistic expectations is artifice from supporters.</p>

<p>Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, which nobody honest can deny. He led a coup against his own government to grab power, used chemical weapons against his own citizens and had very recently led an invasion of a nearby country. All of these things led credibility to the USA&#39;s narrative that he was pursuing WMDs. Had he led a peaceful nation without a history of recent and brutal atrocities, it would have been nearly impossible for the Bush administration to sell such an outrageous lie and launch their occupation of the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The middle east&quot; as the commenter I responded too put it, is not a single nation at all. The wars between Christians and Arabs have been ongoing for so long nobody even knows exactly how hostilities started anymore, all we know is that people from each region have been responsible for horrible atrocities at different points in time. </p>

<p>As long as people are pretending that one side is totally evil and the other completely innocent, this conflict is never going to end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George W. Bush, the man who led the USA during their initial invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan (where I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re alluding too) was a very religious Christian. The USA itself, and western civilization in general, is derived from Christian heritage and a great many of the citizens are very strong believers (more than any other religion).</p>

<p>The Middle East on the other hand is predominantly Muslim, with a great many fundamentalists who frequently cite their faith as a primary reason for waging war against the west.</p>

<p>The history of conflict between these two civilizations goes back literally thousands of years.</p>

<p>What part of that do you not understand.</p>

<p>You make an excellent point. The only solution seems to be checking out the very few YouTubers from Australia who cover both conspiracy and auspol. For example, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ2ZTecxXtQ">video on the recent Hanson Burqa funnies</a>.</p>

<p>One, it&#39;s a move to further make Australians disregard their politicians so we&#39;re even more apathetic about how fucked our system is. 
Two, it&#39;s to normalise dual citizen politicians so we change our constitution to let dual citizens in. But that&#39;d obviously be fucking moronic for a country to allow dual citizens, right?</p>

Ranting elsewhere in the documentary about Warlocks and Harry Potter? Probably only moderately crazy, I&#39;ve seen some crazy shit posted on reddit. &quot;It&#39;s no wonder, with that kind of intense training and discipline, that those young people are ready to kill themselves for the cause of Islam. I wanna see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam. I wanna see them as radically laying down their lives for the Gospel as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine and all those different places, you know, because we have... excuse me, but we have the truth!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m NOT trying to be insensitive or callous, but unless its another 9/11, or a nuke is involved, many people just don&#39;t have the emotional energy to care any longer. This is what 16 years of war has done to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the thing you have to understand is that Nazi symbols are very offensive to the chosen people. In fact, <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/jym.png">the suffering of the jewish people is the entire reason that the concept was even defined</a>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s ok to keep attention rooted on this because G-d chose them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile over 10 europeans are dead but that&#39;s a bit different. You see, g-d didn&#39;t choose Europeans as the chosen people. And it&#39;s extremely offensive to think that European suffering is anywhere near as important as Jewish suffering.</p>

<p>If anything those Europeans should just accept brown migrants to their country then remember BrownLivesMatter (only when interacting with europeans) so that the Europeans don&#39;t get too uppity. </p>

<p>That will keep those damn Europeans down for good, and will be a final solution to the xenophobic problem!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a time when the media would have simply called someone a &quot;self-styled Nazi&quot; so as not to confuse any of your wannabe everyday run-of-the-mill low-life&#39;s, street criminals, and budding psychopaths with a swastika tattoo on their forearm or a big double lightning-bolt emblazoned on their calf just for the hell of it from the kind of highly trained and methodical killers that Hitler&#39;s regime produced since there is no real comparison between them nor between what you might call having a reasonable amount of caution and concern regarding the existence of the one vs. the far more real and palpable fear that surrounded the existence of other in it&#39;s day. </p>

<p>In short the media has a responsibility NOT to overstate or engender any further public fear when there clearly was no obvious need or reason to and they fully recognised and took that responsibility seriously. </p>

<p>When someone goes off the proverbial &quot;deep-end&quot; it&#39;s important to maintain that perspective in what you proceed to report about them or whatever they presumably believe that apparently set them off. </p>

<p>We have all kinds of incidents that fall into that category like the man who took a shotgun and actually killed a nine year old boy in the process of running across his front lawn for no other reason than that. </p>

<p>Such incidents are disturbing but we recognise the unlikely nature of the incidents themselves in regards to the likelihood of them ever occurring again. We certainly don&#39;t live in abject fear of the idea that such people can and do exist or we&#39;d never go out the door again.</p>

<p>What&#39;s missing from all the MSM accounts attempting to actually generate an unreasonable amount of fear over this is how it was all very much <em>allowed to happen</em> by the police and civil authorities who knew far enough in advance that if they were going to allow a controversial and questionable gathering in the first place they needed to take adequate measures to see that the assembly and dispersal was peaceful and orderly and that the streets surrounding the gathering had a strong police presence to ensure that there were no incidents of violence, vandalism, or confrontations with any ordinary people simply going about their business.</p>

<p>The event, of course, very much resembles what took place in Times Square New York not so very long ago, that was suspicious enough to consider if they aren&#39;t in fact linked or were set-up according to some pre-determined agenda that the MSM is also assisting in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be better if it was possible to discuss theories and discuss discrepancies within certain incidents instead of running a half pissing contest which looks like a near equivalence of children demanding fairness. Yes, the coverage is unbalanced, and it could be for reasons that are more nuanced. No muslim owes you anything though if this is your personal opinion OP, and not general reflection. This instance it could be likely because an attack like this hasn&#39;t been as common, (ideology) and it&#39;s on US soil.                   Numerous people have died under Western policies, because of the war machine in the m/e. Is it more &quot;fair&quot; now? I agree that it should be balanced, but this bickering frames it as some sort of contest, but at least in invites to discussion too. </p>
