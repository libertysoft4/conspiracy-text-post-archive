        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First let me say that I have no proof of this, just a sneaking suspicion. I do not condone the KKK/White Supremacists/ Antifa/Neo-Confederates, etc. I am posting this on the conspiracy forum for a reason, it is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>So, many on this site have pointed out that the police were told to stand down multiple times in Charlottesville, and that the 2 groups were permitted to stage about a third of a mile apart, with no wall of police between them (bad idea).</p>

<p>Lets say that you are the KKK, a neo-confederate, a goose stepping Nazi. Somebody you really hate. Lets say you go push your BS, maybe even rough up a few people, and count yourself lucky that you are not arrested. Lets say you get into your car to head home, and as you are leaving a line of Antifa cross your path, recognize you, and start to beat your car with baseball bats. You, as a piece of shit, but a piece of shit who is in legitimate fear for your life panic, and try to get out of the situation. Your car is repeatedly beaten, you see an empty street as you are chased, and you try to flee, only to have your path blocked. You are fearful for your life and try to ram through the group. You injure a bunch of people and kill someone. You then find another way out, and are ultimately arrested.</p>

<p>This is still an unacceptable course of action, but is a far cry from deliberately trying to mow down a group of people. I believe that if this was pre-meditated and an actual terrorist attack, he would have killed far more people. If I&#39;m not mistaken, assuming this is terrorism, this idiot will have the lowest kill count of any terrorist vehicular attack.</p>

<p>I think if he were actually just trying to kill a bunch of people, he would have aimed for just a crowd of people, not a crowd of people and cars. If I am not mistaken, people usually get out and try to shoot/stab people to when they do this. I just saw the guy panic and try to get away. </p>

<p>How did this guys car get damaged before he ran into the crowd if this was a straight up terrorist attack?</p>

<p>I know this is a controversial statement, but I thought I&#39;d put it here to see if anyone had the same thought. </p>

<p>Once again, let me say that the KKK/Antifa/White Supremacists/ neo-nazis are bad people... who all have the right to their (ignorant) free speech and dangerous ideas. </p>

I believe there are pictures of the back of his car with pre-existing damage (from when who knows) and there is a video on RT (maybe) that seems to show a protestor wielding a bat or something similar striking his vehicle.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. I&#39;m not going to argue with you about it. Facts are facts. When that guy took a swing with the pole at the back of the killers car, the killer was already speeding into the crowd causing people to jump out of the way. The connection with the civilian hitting the back of the car with a pole and the driver hitting bodies is less than one second. I can understand a conspiracy about who the driver was/someone coercing him/etc, etc. But the whole &quot;he was scared!&quot; theory is a lie and provably false.</p>

I could see a similar unknown case being judged on its merits and going either way, but in this scenario as soon as the prosecution states that he was in a &quot;Nazi&quot; rally and that he didn&#39;t seek police help or stop after the alleged &quot;self defense&quot;, the jurors will hang him without a second thought.

<p>in this video you can hear people screaming in horror, see people reacting by starting to record with their phones, and hear his tires screech from acceleration well before that dumbass taps his bumper with the bat. in fact, one could argue that bumper tap was some kind of knee jerk response to this obvious aggression by acceleration.</p>

<p>looks like this moron didnt account for any other cars being in the crowd to prevent him to continue to accelerate.</p>

<p>I am saying that this may be a recorded moment where a driver felt it was necessary to drive a heavy metal object through a crowd to save his/her life. </p>

<p>Lets say the driver was attacked before he rammed the crowd, and you could see he was visibly in fear for his life. How many people would it be okay for him to mow down to save his own? This is 100% related if my initial conspiracy is correct.</p>

<p>let me ask you though, why was he driving down that street to begin with? There are videos of the incident from a birds-eye  view thanks to drone footage, and it clearly shows that the intersection was really the only place where that crowd was.</p>

<p>Why would this guy drive on a street that clearly has a crowd that you can see blocks away? Why didnt he just head down another street to get around it? Could it be safe to assume at the very least he drove down this street with the idea of anatagonizing the protestors that he disagreed with?</p>
