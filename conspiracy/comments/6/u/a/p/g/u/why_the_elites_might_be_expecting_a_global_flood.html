        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s the link to a theory that I posted in r/FringeTheory. If you want to comment here or there it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s my sub and I&#39;m OK with comments from anyone, wherever they&#39;re commenting from.</p>

<p>tldr; I learned that there&#39;s an actual way that the solar wind can make water, in space. It doesn&#39;t take much imagination to see that there could be a rational explanation for ancient flood stories from around the globe. </p>

<p>Being a conspiracy theorist, I started to wonder what some people would do if they knew a flood like this was coming. It does seem to explain a lot of things... some of which I wrote about in the link.</p>

<p>Why am I posting it here? Because I honestly suspect that the kind of people who run the world wouldn&#39;t warn the rest of us (ahead of time). They&#39;d convince themselves that a big population reduction was a good thing in the long run... and most of their planning would be on how to rebuild afterwards.</p>

<p>So the conspiracy is suppressed knowledge of global disaster. Knowledge of this might date from ancient times. I had one idea that the Great Pyramid itself is like a flood marker. Missing gold pyramidion represents the people who survived because they were above the peak flood level. Old Kingdom of Egypt founded by the survivors, which explains the continuity of Egyptian culture... and why the Old Kingdom seemed more advanced than the Middle Kingdom.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ll head over to r/Alternative History and see what they think?</p>

<p>How do <em>you</em> know that?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re quoting the first of Yahweh&#39;s covenants in that oft-quoted holy book, the Bible. You must first establish that the Bible is a reliable source of information, and that the Hebrew texts were translated correctly (and before that, copied correctly from the <em>original</em> texts).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve pondered this every day. </p>

<p>The three most commonly practiced faiths detail a catastrophic flood; the many Native American tribes all talk of major floods; pretty sure the Bhagat-Vita details one as well. </p>

<p>Massive floods are not unheard of &amp; if you think so wake the fuck up, go on google &amp; look up the Grand Canyon. That used to be a river aka not the biggest body of water so it stands to reason our planet can definitely experience major flooding events. </p>

<p>Furthermore, plenty of factors can lead to raised water levels or at least a perceived rise in water levels. From solar radiation affecting atmospheric ratios to general climate changes affecting small microbial organisms that have even larger effects on whatever ecosystem they&#39;re in. </p>

<p>Either way it doesn&#39;t matter; I don&#39;t see our species being ended by a flood (too many oligarchs are prepared so they&#39;ll live). I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t see a massive flood event at some point but I would put my money on a nuclear waste planet before flooded planet since we made nuclear warheads before we figured out tectonic plates are actually a thing. </p>

<p>The mainstream fought tooth and nail to refuse this hypothesis yet it still stands.</p>

<p>when this &quot;flooding&quot; event happened comes down to weather or not you believe modern dating methods are reliable or not.</p>

<p>Theoretically you could detonate a massive nuke underwater and wash Europe off the map.</p>

<p>makes you wonder why the oldest maps of Africa show more detail than the more modern maps.</p>

<p>would a giant salt water wave create something like the sahara desert?</p>

<p>Funny enough when asked about his invention Oppenheimer exclaimed it was the first nuclear device in modern times...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you mentioned Electric Universe... they have a mechanism that can serve as a source of water for a global flood.</p>

<p>Check out this link at the 17 min mark.</p>

<p>Just hit pause. What you&#39;re looking at is very important. Why? Because it shows a way that the solar wind can make water in space from almost anything floating around up there.</p>

<p>If there was a solar event that boosted the solar wind by, say, a couple orders of magnitude... you could see huge quantities of water being produced in space. </p>

<p>I think this happens a lot more than we know. Maybe some of this water ends up on Mars or the Moon, which would explain how they can find ice on the Moon and water erosion on Mars.</p>

<p>Say Earth passes through a mass of water drifting in space. It rains for 40 days an 40 nights... let&#39;s say 2 feet of water per day. Anywhere that wasn&#39;t a mountaintop would be flooded right out in the first couple of days.</p>

<p>Survivors would be people living in the mountains or the highest plateaus. This might be why we have cultural memories of holy wise men living on mountain tops. This might be why Tibetans built their greatest monasteries way the fuck up in the Himalayas.</p>

<p>So if Electric Universe gives a way for us to get a flood, maybe it has a mechanism to get rid of all the water afterwards? I had an idea about all that water from space affecting the Earth&#39;s natural charge level (if it has such a thing). Maybe the water goes back into space (in a planet sized cometary tail) and this is powered by the built up charge returning to normal?</p>

<p>tldr; There&#39;s a known chemical process that occurs in space that makes a Noah-type flood much more plausible.</p>

<p>Which is amazing because it implies that someone in the distant past was aware that water existed in the heavens as well as the oceans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe not water in space, but a cataclysm is coming. It&#39;s cyclical and the ancients dedicated whole civilisations to tracking when this would happen again. The elites have been building underground cities for decades and I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head that they are just preparing to be in the best position to survive the aftermath. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually made me think of fusion energy. They figured out the fusion process itself about 7 decades ago. Yet, for whatever reason, we keep getting told that commercial fusion reactors are another 20 or 30 years in the future. And they&#39;ve been saying that for the last 40 years.</p>

<p>I think the people who know what&#39;s coming figure it would be a waste of time building the futuristic kind of world we could have right now, just to see it all get ruined.</p>

<p>So, develop the tech, store it away with a bunch of supplies. This would mean the post-cataclysm rebuilding would proceed as fast as possible... instead of us being set back to the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m thinking that some of those hundreds of $billions spent on the military might be paying for just such a project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the last cataclysm, several old legends talk about figures coming to reteach mankind civilisation then leaving. I would wager that the elites know this and have thought they could do the same after the aftermath of this next one. Only they wouldn&#39;t reteach mankind and leave, they would impose themselves as gods and rule over them with superior technology. Kind of how the Egyptian gods did. My guess is they have been learning from the histories they have confiscated via the Vatican to plan how to not only survive the impending cataclysm, but how to make sure they rule over everyone else. Might even be they are trying to perpetuate the dynasties that have ruled behind the curtain for centuries. </p>

<p>However I also suspect they have been duped by the higher up entities that use them. I think they may have been deceived into thinking that this next cataclysm is survivable like the last one. I don&#39;t believe it is, I have good reason to believe that this time it will send the Earth the way of Mars and make it permanently uninhabitable. </p>
