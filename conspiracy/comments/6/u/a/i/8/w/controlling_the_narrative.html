    <div class="md"><p>Yea, that&#39;s a red herring.  Four weeks ago weren&#39;t you talking about Putin?</p>

<p>Then last week about war with  NK .</p>

<p>And now racial violence.  </p>

<p>Did Putin just STOP having committed election manipulation?  </p>

<p>Oh yeah, he did, and they can&#39;t prove it--so let&#39;s get people up in arms about NK.
Oh but now that&#39;s not happening anymore either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy how these world events just fucking vanish and you move on.  It&#39;s been a story for 6 months, sure, the only story.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I fail to see your point. During the olympics news is dominated by new about the olympics. Why don&#39;t we hear anything now about the olympics?</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused about what OP is attempting to show with this. The Russian story is still very much in the news but just not &quot;front page&quot; right now. These types of investigations can take years and just because there&#39;s not breaking news everyday of the week does not make it go away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shocking that you fail to see it.  Like someone who already doesn&#39;t understand and/or objects to this post would.  </p>

<p>So you&#39;re suggesting here that for 6 months literally nothing happened but Russia, right?</p>

<p>That&#39;s all they reported on after all.  </p>

<p>So zilch else happened and there was no concerted effort to put our eyeballs on that story that has never had any actual evidence other than &quot;anonymous intelligence individuals believe...&quot;</p>

<p>So in your mind, no events took place while the Russia story went on.  Because they only report on what&#39;s pertinent right?</p>

<p>And now that story has vanished.  Gone.</p>

<p>But yeah, there&#39;s no plan as to what the people are allowed/deliberately led to hear.</p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;ll play along just in case you just got back from a cruse or something and have not seen the news in months. It&#39;s now a proven fact, verified by emails from a whole bunch of people in the White House that their was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents. These emails were turned over, not leaked or hacked or just rumors from unnamed sources. Verified emails. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Difference? In how Clinton ran her campaign? She was shady as hell and I&#39;m pretty sure she was cheating and breaking laws. I would love to see the dnc ban her from ever running for office again. If she were in office I would be all over that shit. But right now she&#39;s not and today we found out that trumps team met with a spy who is an ace at email hacking. And they knew going into the meeting that they were going to get dirt.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry man, you are wrong about why one is more important than the other. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really quite simple. </p>

<p>If both candidates made deals with foreign powers and compromised the security of our nation in order to get in elected then both should be investigated. But here&#39;s the kicker: only one got elected so only one is a direct threat to me right now. </p>

<p>If the clintons did commit crimes I would love to hear about it and have it come to light. But does it affect my life right now? No not at all. </p>

<p>Look at it like this, driving drunk is not cool and makes someone a menace to society. If you told me you knew a guy who drove home last year drunk from an office party I would still consider that a serious crime even though it happened last year. </p>

<p>But if you said there is a guy who is driving around drunk every day, through crowded school zones in every town and will keep doing it every day for the next 3+ years I would say this needs to end right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get what you are trying to argue here. I&#39;m all for investigating Clinton. I have never supported her and if she broke laws then she should be held accountable. </p>

<p>You do know that it&#39;s possible to have two ongoing different investigations right? I&#39;m so confused that you think that because one person possibly did something it&#39;s ok for Trump to do something. </p>

<p>Also, you should learn more about the uranium deal you keep bringing up. It&#39;s not so simple as you are making it out to be. She was one of many people who needed to sign off on the mining operation and it was not to sell uranium to Russia. It was to give a Russian company rights to mine but they could not take it back to Russia and she did not get paid. Her charity got donations and she does not get paid by the charity but I&#39;m sure it influences policy and I am all for an investigation into that foundation. It smacks of corruption up and down and I am all about getting foreign money out of our political system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that you&#39;re agreeing we can and should investigate Clinton, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m asking.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t care then, and you didn&#39;t care that the Dems were doing it all along as well during the campaign.  This is no different in any way.  Why is this the event of a lifetime when back then it was whatever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s an interesting thing to say bc I&#39;ve asked this question over and over (and over) and can&#39;t get a straight answer from you.</p>

<p>Look- you care bc the news is telling you to.  It was hidden when Clinton did it and got millions of dollars, but now that it&#39;s trump, it&#39;s suddenly all over the news.</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t you asking yourself why that is?  For yourself and for the media?</p>

<p>Not me, no.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling it like other fucking people see it.  </p>

<p>Yep, that&#39;s right.  ANYBODY but me.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s how I&#39;m calling it.  (Maybe not with the same phrase, <em>over and over</em>,  but yep, that&#39;s still what I&#39;m doing).</p>

<p>Go be a hypocrite to someone else.</p>

<p>By all means, I&#39;m sure you will respond bc you can&#39;t help yourself, but I won&#39;t be reading it.</p>

<p>Best of luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you have no friends. Bc anyone with a  Facebook account has seen a political post.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t you should get out more often, seriously.  Which tells us you have no life and therefore no real point that can be useful to actual social humans.</p>

<p>Anyway all of us who are real people have seen at least one political post from our friends and family in Facebook.  If you say you haven&#39;t, you&#39;re lying.</p>

<p>So all done here.  Not getting anywhere with deliberate lying for...whatever reason.</p>
