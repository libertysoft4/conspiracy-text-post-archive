It was Russia non stop for months then boom that is given up on and now anyone on the right is a Nazi. How low can the democrats go in trying to make us fight each other. Everyone was 1000% sure the Russians hacked the election but now that the story has completely fallen apart its 1984 time to rewrite history and move on. Once the Nazi angle stops working they will find something else. I was one of the biggest Bernie supporters to walk the earth but even he has gone off the deep end. Fucking sad state of affairs we are living in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The accusation of &quot;hacking the election&quot; comes from the DNC&#39;s and Podesta&#39;s email hack. Most of the intelligence community attributes this hack to Russia. There&#39;s also the massive counterintelligence operations they conducted through the spreading of actual fake news. </p>

<p>Both these things are well documented and for someone who&#39;s trying to &quot;son&quot; people on the internet about the investigation, you should be able to answer what is a pretty basic question central to the investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are Trump defenders always so confused about what&#39;s going on with the Russians? Do you really think that the reason there is an investigation is because the &quot;Russians hacked the election&quot;? No one thinks the russians &quot;hacked&quot; the election. What they think is that the Trump campaign was working with russian intelligence to gain information on hillary clinton, in order to win the election. It was a concerted effort by Trump and the russians, to spread misinformation on the internet as well as to spread illegally gained emails from hillary&#39;s campaign. Once again, no one, NO ONE, thinks the election was hacked. That is not what collusion means. This is what collusion means:
noun
a secret agreement, especially for fraudulent or treacherous purposes; conspiracy.
Law. a secret understanding between two or more persons to gain something illegally, to defraud another of his or her rights, or to appear as adversaries though in agreement.</p>

<p>the entire DNC and much of the MSM has been tossing out RUSHNZHACKEDRNOMS headlines since the election.</p>

Maybe you could supply some links of them saying &quot;The investigation is about russians hacking the election&quot; because that&#39;s not what they&#39;re investigating. Maybe that&#39;s what you think, but that&#39;s not real. The investigation is over collusion, which I&#39;ve already explained and defined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The media coverage blew this incident out of proportion&quot;</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t refute his point. Many, many people didn&#39;t believe in Watergate.</p>

<p>&quot;It took a while for them to roll it up to Nixon. This is a completely different situation&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually the exact same situation, thats what&#39;s happening right now and is precisely the reason why the investigation is taking so long. Everyone around Trump is being interviewed/investigated. Its well documented and I&#39;m sure your aware, it seems like you&#39;re being intentionally dishonest.</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody thought that Trump had a chance at winning. It was not until after he did win that this became an issue. It is sour grapes.&quot;</p>

<p>Most polls were giving Trump at least a 30% chance of winning the election. The hack was being attributed to Russia before the election. It&#39;s not sour grapes, the reason the speculation picked up after the investigation is because <em>multiple</em> Trump team members were caught lying about meeting with Russians.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, why are we not investigating the people who are responsible for making sure the elections are not hacked or manipulated? &quot;</p>

<p>You need to do more research into the investigation, nobody is insinuating that the election itself was hacked or manipulated. Obama meant you couldn&#39;t hack the results of the election, and as far as anyone knows that&#39;s still the case. Again, thats not what the investigation is about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  So the Russians did not hack the election machines.  We can agree on that.  </p>

<p>I was asking in another thread about the alleged Russian manipulation.  Where is the affect on the poll results?  Hillary was consistently winning in the polls, which is not what would be expected if misinformation was being released.   Did Hillary&#39;s poll numbers dip because of Wikileaks?  </p>

<p>Hillary had an 85% chance of winning on election day, according to the NY Times.   </p>

<p>I have done a lot of research, and I don&#39;t see how anyone ruined Hillary&#39;s chances besides Hillary herself.  Well, maybe Podesta...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The investigation continues under it comes to conclusion. This can take years, for example 2 years for Nixon, or Benghazi which was still drawing money till the end of 2016.</p>

<p>The latest perspective seems to be ramping up. A Grand Jury was convened, and tidbits were found about questionable meeings with Kushner, Sessions statements have proven misleading as meetings were moved to Trump Tower with Russians last minute. These investigations always take time, and this one is no different.</p>

<p>We just have to await Muellers statement on completion, but even then investigations don&#39;t always stop. For instance, there were 8 seperate investigations into Benghazi, one costing tax payers over $10 million. Bureaucracy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why you call a political move, &#39;a coward&#39;, it was strategic, feigning is a war tactic. Survival isn&#39;t cowardly.

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t wildly different (they&#39;re actually quite compatible) and being in different languages is a kind of funny. Lol. </p>

<p>As an aside, your point about Detroit was spot on. </p>

<p>&quot;Another chapter of the pre-Fascist era is brought happily to its close with the doom of Parliament and the identification of Politics with the wider aspects of life.&quot; </p>

<p>Giving control of constitutional rights to monopolies is what Mussolini encouraged his government to do. Identity politics is how it is accomplished without the people realizing their rights are being taken away because they are actively fighting in ways that weaken their control over their rights. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism, which is the very antithesis of Individualism, stands as the nemesis of all economic doctrines and all economic practice of both the capitalistic and the communistic systems. Fascism holds that:
1)The economic life of man cannot be abstracted and separated from the whole of his spiritual life. In the words of Mussolini: “The economic man does not exist. Man is integral; he is political, economic, religious, saint and warrior at the same time.”
2)The economic life of man is influenced, if not actually determined, by idealistic factors.
3)True economic progress can derive only from the concerted effort of individuals who know how to sacrifice their personal egoism and ambitions for the good of the whole.
4)Economic initiatives cannot be left to the arbitrary decisions of private, individual interests.
5)Open competition, if not wisely directed and restricted, actually destroys wealth instead of creating it.
6)The wealth of a community is something intangible which cannot be identified with the sum of riches of single individuals.
7)The proper function of the State in the Fascist system is that of supervising, regulating and arbitrating the relationships of capital and labor, employers and employees, individuals and associations, private interests and national interests.
8)Class war is avoidable and must be avoided. Class war is deleterious to the orderly and fruitful life of the nation therefore it has no place in the Fascist State.
9)More important than the production of wealth is its right distribution, distribution which must benefit in the best possible way all the classes of the nation, hence, the nation itself.</p>

<p>I never considered how alluring Fascism could be. </p>

<p>From WIKI:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>non-elected form of state officializing of every interest into the state was professed to reduce the marginalization of singular interests (as would allegedly happen by the unilateral end condition inherent in the democratic voting process). Corporatism would instead better recognize or &quot;incorporate&quot; every divergent interest into the state organically, according to its supporters, thus being the inspiration for their use of the term totalitarian, perceivable to them as not meaning a coercive system but described distinctly as <strong>without coercion</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Successfull Fascism convinces people, through very appealing terms, to surrender their personhood to the state. </p>

<p>FDR on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerated the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself.</p>

<p>That in its essence is fascism: ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surrendering Congressional and Judicial oversight to private companies to circumvent constitutional law and getting people to actually ask for it. It&#39;s the Third Way. </p>
