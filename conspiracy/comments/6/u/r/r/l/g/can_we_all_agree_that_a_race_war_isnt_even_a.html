    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say &quot;every&quot;. I said it&#39;s tough to find, because I have never met one and every gun owner I have interacted with in my life leaned to the right. That&#39;s excellent that your experience is different. How many left-flavored militias are there in this country versus right? </p>

<p>I do agree that the dichotomy is shitty, but I&#39;m really wondering how much each side is armed and willing to use it because my comment was in regards to a civil war. If skirmishes break out I think the people involved would probably know which side they identify with and not necessarily agree or care about globalist divide and conquer tactics, so I think it was a question worth asking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually are well established sides, here. You have a large mass of people who are Conservatives/Constitutionalists who think the federal government is too big, overbearing, corrupt, and against the Constitution. </p>

<p>Then you have a mass of people who are Marxists/Socialists and want to grow the unconstitutional federal government and have the government provide various things for them.</p>

<p>What we are seeing is a build up quite similar to what the first civil war was about. State rights and the Constitution.  </p>

<p>Same for the conservative constitutionalism, right now the Republicans are a majority in Congress I have not seen them make any move to restore the rights taken by the Patriot act and Homeland Security and it is my impression that one of their goals is a re-write of the U.S. Constitution to eliminate the very idea of individual rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the thought, but in all honesty, you cannot have one without the other. Remember, if the government hands it out, it can take it away, at any moment. We have inherit/ un-a-<strong>lienable</strong> rights from our Creator, outlined and solidified in the Constitution. The Government does not give out these rights, the document was to tell the Government this is how it is and you cannot take these away.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m talking about with the ever growing divide. Many of us are waking up to this, and saying enough is enough. We have shifted completely from what this nation was founded on, or at least tried to establish, before it was co-opted and infiltrated. It&#39;s the idea of freedom vs. tyranny. Damn near everything that has happened in this country after 1871, was treasonous to the Constitution and our Republic.</p>

<p>This is why the comparison between the first civil war and now, is so apparent. The &quot;government&quot; now, is really just a Corporation owned by international bankers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making assumptions about which socialist ideals(and how/where they are applied) I was thinking of which is perhaps my fault. I definitely agree that if we have a welfare state, a large fed is pretty much a given. </p>

<p>Socialism is much more vast than govt handouts, and doesn&#39;t have to include them. I see the word socialism get used all the time when someone probably meant fascism, or welfare programs(but not the ones they benefit from), or globalist forced diversity/equality and none of those are inherent to socialism as a whole. Socialist ideals can be purely economic, or exist within a workplace regardless of the nation&#39;s politics.</p>

<p>Yes, we have had some instances where garbage operated under the banner of socialism but centralization sucks regardless of what -ism is currently in charge, and I think the tendency to centralize is not explicit in socialism or capitalism but inherent in humanity itself. Europe v usa in terms of healthcare and education is murdering us and I think it&#39;s because of this whacked out is-it-free-market-or-not regulatory capture revolving door bullshit we&#39;ve got going on. We&#39;re in a fascist state anyway and it isn&#39;t because of govt handouts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and some of us noticed this same power behind Charlottsville spend several summers trying to instigate and provoke riots in urban black neighborhoods, and pushed really hard in 2012 and the nearest they came was Ferguson and they had to hire the violent people themselves. (about 2012, remember it was not one but several young black men who were shot by police that summer.)</p>

<p>So they not only can&#39;t get African Americans to riot, they have to hire both sides to try to make a race war.  </p>

<p>Aren&#39;t they pitiful? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to watch the Cracked video about an american civil war. </p>

<p>At first, I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be incredibly insightful. They had a few ranking generals talk about the &quot;civil wars&quot; in the middle east, and how it would turn out here in america. </p>

<p>And frankly, it&#39;s a lot, lot, easier to start a civil war than you would think. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about a one v. one type of war. </p>

<p>In reality, it would be much more of a clusterfuck of militia&#39;s, gangs, and citzens all infighting amoung themselves. And it only takes a little bit of violence to tip the scales. If the &quot;nazi&#39;s&quot; do some shit to the black community, and the black community retaliates, it wouldn&#39;t take much to get everyone literally at each others throats. And after a long enough timeline, know one would know who started it, or who they were fighting. Hence, it would be a clusterfuck, and not a typical civil war.</p>

<p>Just a general degrading of human civility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A race war has been going on in this country since the 1600s.... continued after chattle slavery with the 13th amendment&#39;s exception clause which continues the race war today... So it&#39;s garbage to say &quot;start a race war&quot; when we&#39;ve been in one for centuries... This is a divide and conquer tactic that TPTB use often...  Don&#39;t fall for it... Destroy the system and start fresh where everyone is actually equal... Imo it&#39;s the only solution</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is the thing, they are setting this up to play in to the white supremicists fears, a war on whites.</p>

<p>look at the videos coming from the counter protests, they are like KKK recruitment videos ffs.</p>

<p>any one who even thought there was a shred of truth to that narrative now has hours of video of people attacking white people &quot;trying to stand up for their race&quot;</p>

<p>this is such a blatant psyop it infuriates me how well its working.</p>
