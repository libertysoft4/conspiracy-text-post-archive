<p>&quot;From my close-up inspection there&#39;s no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This crash [Shanksville] was different. There was no wreckage, no bodies, and no noise.&quot;</p>

<p>~ Somerset County Coroner Wallace Miller</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I was looking for anything that said tail, wing, plane, metal. There was nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>~ Photographer Scott Spangler (Shanksville)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I was amazed because it [Shanksville] did not, in any way, shape, or form, look like a plane crash.&quot;</p>

Like this guy above who posted the tmz video of the crash site. He is 8/10 sure that it is fake. WTF is he talking about!? Looks like a helicopter with a full tank of gas crashed and burning to me. The person filming even points out the shredded trees where the chopper came through. What would even be the point of faking some helicopter crash where two cops died? To snatch your guns?

    <div class="md"><p>No. I think it crashed because of an accident. Cars crash, helicopters crash, accidents happen. I see zero evidence of anything fishy going on. Sometimes helicopters crash. I&#39;m sure the FAA is investigating it. It might take a minute for them to figure out why it crashed. I&#39;ll wait for the report before I just start believing in some completely unfounded, wild speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A very good question I think a lot of us are asking, especially because it kept being reported it was connected to the the people getting run over, (roping the two trooper deaths into the whole body count) but yet there hasn&#39;t been any additional information released as far as I&#39;ve seen. 
If Indeed this was an orchestrated event, common sense makes me think whoever was involved in it has had plenty of practice and skill pulling off things like this before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly never heard that it was &quot;brought down&quot; by anyone. The reason that it crashed has not been disclosed because the FAA is probably still investigating it. It will most likely be some form of operator error. The only reason it was mentioned in the same sentence as the other violence is that the whole reason it was in the air in the first place was to watch the protesters. It&#39;s not like anyone said it was shot down with an RPG or something. This whole thing is potato-grade dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless I missed something and demonstrators brought some sort of anti-aircraft ordinance, I&#39;m at a loss there too. Probably banking on people hearing the soundbites and blaming it on the driver of the challenger. I almost think it would&#39;ve raised less eyebrows among like minded folk if they didn&#39;t even report the crash, plenty of &quot;training exercises gone wrong&quot; happen all the time (more often than not military) and most people read it, believe it, and don&#39;t think anything else about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prove? Maybe nothing, or maybe it was a honesty being reported during the chaos. I found it strange that an article about a helo crash reports the neighbors saw it land in the woods. It stuck out to me, but I went back to work an forgot until I saw this post an it reminded me of what I read.  </p>

Couple that with it happened exactly when this car attack occurred.  I do wonder if they were gonna have some alt right cop killing nazi story on standy by?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of reminds me of the camo man who was apprehended running into the woods near Sandy Hook. Just kind of a bizarre detail on the periphery of a false flag event that makes us say &quot;wtf?&quot; and could indicate there was a change of plans or something went awry, or could just be a total distraction to obfuscate the chain of events that they know we will be analyzing.</p>
