<li><p>“condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter.

    <div class="md"><p>Where did I ever say that? Not even sure what the two have in common. Like I&#39;ve asked before and no one has responded with an answer; if we were selling them weapons during the Bush administration and continue through the Obama admin and are still selling them weapons why would he need to bribe her or anybody else? Did we change the type or amount of weapons we are selling them?</p>

<p>Keep in mind the supreme court ruling on political corruption. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the court, narrowed the definition of what sort of conduct can serve as the basis of a corruption prosecution. He said only formal and concrete government actions counted — filing a lawsuit, say, or making an administrative determination. Routine political courtesies like arranging meetings or urging underlings to consider a matter, he added, generally do not, even when the people seeking those favors give the public officials gifts or money.</p>

<p>Until after the foundation releases whatever records they are required to release how are we to know that donations have dried up? Do you have a list of major presidential candidates speaking fees and engagement from before and after they lost the election to compare? I know it&#39;s impossible to think that someone would want to relax after going through the primary and general election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your article:</p>

<p>It&#39;s illegal for foreign individuals, corporations and governments to either give money directly to U.S. candidates or spend on advertising to influence U.S. elections. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s also illegal for candidates to solicit foreign money, regardless of whether the donations ever materialize. </p>

<p>There is now vast documentary evidence that the Trump campaign is continuing to do just that.</p>

<p>Bob Blackman, a member of the U.K. House of Commons, shared with The Hill a fundraising solicitation sent to his government email address from the Trump campaign on July 12.</p>

<p>&quot;I did not sign up, these are sent unsolicited,&quot; Blackman told The Hill in an email.</p>

<p>Another member of the U.K. Parliament, Peter Bottomley, said he&#39;d received three solicitations from the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>&quot;Neither [Trump&#39;s] sons nor anyone else has answered my questions about how they acquired my email nor why they were asking for financial support that I suppose to be illegal for [Trump] to accept,&quot; Bottomley told The Hill in an email.</p>

<p>Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance watchdog Democracy 21, said he&#39;s never in his four-decade career seen a campaign continue to brazenly solicit foreign cash after being publicly called out. </p>

<p>&quot;This is kind of absurd. I don&#39;t know of anyone else in this situation who would just go on keeping on soliciting money from foreign interests,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the fact circumstances here are unprecedented. </p>

<p>&quot;If they are put on notice that their fundraising solicitations of potential foreign donors are illegal and they keep doing it, then you potentially have knowing and willful violations of the law, which moves this from civil violations to criminal violations,&quot; Wertheimer continued.</p>

<p>Wertheimer said he&#39;s going to assess the latest facts and may launch a criminal complaint in addition to his standing FEC complaint.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s open and shut that federal candidates can&#39;t solicit contributions from foreign donors,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s an open and shut that federal candidates can&#39;t solicit contributions from foreign donors.&quot;</p>

<p>..&quot;it&#39;s also illegal for candidates to solicit money whether or not the donations materialize&quot;(paraphrasing)</p>

<p>Did any action against Trump take place for this blatant and obvious solicitation happen?</p>

<p>Nope.Desipte numerous reports,no action against him took place.Why?This was before he was president.He had no ability to use influence to protect him against legal action against him.And with all the shit thrown at him post-election,you&#39;d think tnat would have been used against him.But,nope!Nothing happened.He is a very business smart man.Don&#39;t you think that maybe this is more post Smith-Mundt repeal horeshit?</p>

<p>Little experts from the article:</p>

<p>Clinton opened a trading account, although Blair made most of the trades</p>

<p>The editor of the Journal of Futures Markets said in April 1994, &quot;This is like buying ice skates one day and entering the Olympics a day later. She took some extraordinary risks.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s defenders also stressed that Blair and others stayed in the market longer than Clinton and lost much of what they had previously earned, showing that the risk was real.[3] Indeed, some reports had Blair losing $15 million[22] and Bone was reported as bankrupt.[7]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are claiming that the $12,000,000 Morocco gave to the Clintons didn&#39;t go to them personally but to the foundation that they started, control and employed their daughter and pay for her wedding, among other things.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re claiming that the money was spent to do ________ (something legitimate).  BUT you can&#39;t say what.  Where did the $12,000,000 go? For what charitable purpose? It&#39;s all public record so lmk.</p></li>
<li><p>You also claim that oh no there is no &quot;pay to play&quot; possible even though Hillary was Sec. of State and miraculously the Govt. approved advanced weapons sales months after this ridiculously enormous donation took place?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe you could support your defense of Hillary, Bill, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative with some facts no just that I hate them, which is really irrelevant.</p>

<p>Also, why don&#39;t you give me a specific instance where the Government of Morocco has given $12,000,000 or more to a <em>private</em> US based charity or foundation. Ever.  I can&#39;t find any record of that but maybe you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Uranium One</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 2009 to 2013, the Russian atomic energy agency (Rosatom) acquired Uranium One, a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20% of the uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset with national security implications, the acquisition was analyzed by a committee of nine government agencies, including the State Department, which was then headed by Clinton. The voting members of the committee can object to such a foreign transaction, but the final decision then rests with the president.[18]</p>

<p>In April 2015, The New York Times reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One&#39;s chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. The donations were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite a prior agreement to do so. In addition, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and which was promoting Uranium One stock paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow shortly after the acquisition was announced. According to Factcheck.org, there is &quot;no evidence&quot; that the donations influenced Clinton&#39;s official actions or that she was involved in the State Department&#39;s decision to approve the deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you quoted, the State Department was only one of the agencies involved in the sale. However, Hillary was not actually involved in the sale and another State Department employee, Jose Fernandez, handled it. Internal documents, and interviews, show that Hillary did not have any input or decision-making power in the deal. Additionally, uranium cannot be exported outside of the US per US law. This means that a Russian company just makes money off of mining and selling the uranium.</p>

<p>Some snippets from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The money will help kick off a $1 billion women&#39;s empowerment fund that the World Bank will announce in July, he said.
The World Bank fund, which provides technical help and investment funding for women business owners, differs from the Clinton Foundation in some significant ways. While Ivanka Trump proposed the idea along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, she is not involved with its operation.
Norm Eisen, former ethics official for the Obama Administration and a regular critic of the Trump family&#39;s conflicts of interest, noted in an email to NPR, &quot;In my view foreign government donations to a fund run by a reputable international organization like the World Bank for a good cause are generally acceptable.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.Trump himself has said that Epstein is “a lot of fun to be with,” adding that he admired the sex offender&#39;s affinity for beautiful women “on the younger side.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Trump was named in Epstein’s “little black book.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Epstein’s “little black book” was stolen by a former employee in 2004. The book, nicknamed &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; by the employee, revealed the name of Donald Trump and listed “14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump&#39;s security guard and houseman.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was in his fifties when he said that so of course women in their 20s and 30s are much younger to him. You&#39;re really reaching if you think he was admitting to the media that he admired someone for their affinity for underage women. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if you can have acquaintances or friends and not be knowledgeable of their crimes/secrets. </p>

<p>The black book section isn&#39;t even worth commenting on. Trump never denied knowing Epstein so it stands that he would have his contact information. </p>

<p>You still didn&#39;t put Trump on the Island or anywhere near any of his underage sex parties. Your threshold for evidence seems to be extremely low. </p>

<p>Thanks for bringing that point up! So does Trump!</p>

<p>Turns out, he nominated one of the prosecutors who ended up giving Epstein a slap on the wrist and sent him to jail for the bullshit reduction of &quot;soliciting a minor&quot; and 1 year in jail with time served a cushy job as Labor secretary. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s 15+ year old pal Epstein didn&#39;t do any real time thanks to this guy and you know gow Trump rewarded him? By giving him a job when he became president!</p>

<p>YOU just don&#39;t want me to talk about Trump. That&#39;s why you want me to shut up about it. It literally does NOTHING prejudicial to bring up Trump in a conversation about pedophiles and Epstein. It&#39;s entirely relevant.</p>

<p>YOU just have it hard for Trump. That&#39;s not my problem and I certainly won&#39;t listen to anything you have to say trying to get me to stop bringing up your hero&#39;s pedophile past (possibly present, who knows)</p>

<p>Gotta admit,though.I can&#39;t figure if he is a puppet or is playing 3D Chess with the TPTB.</p>
