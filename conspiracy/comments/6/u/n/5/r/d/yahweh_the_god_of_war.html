        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;I form the light, and create darkness. I make peace, and create EVIL.&quot;</p>

<p>All cultures have anthropomorphized their gods into humanoid (if sometimes grotesque) form. Were the Jews the exception? Hardly. We know precisely what the Hebrew god looked like. We are, after all, fashioned in his own likeness!  &quot;Yahweh&quot;, in fact, is an abbreviation of the longer name, &quot;Yahweh Sabaoth.&quot; It means, &quot;He who musters armies.&quot; Thus Yahweh&#39;s name identifies the god primarily as the military leader of the tribe. No wonder the God bequeathed to the world by the Jews turned out to be a monster. </p>

<p>&quot;The Lord is a man of war; Yahweh is his name.&quot; – Exodus  15.3.</p>

<p>The most disturbing aspect of Yahweh’s humanoid personality, however, is his blood-lust. The smell of burning flesh is a ‘sweet savour unto the lord’ – so sweet, in fact, that the phrase appears in the Old Testament no fewer than twenty-three times. The butchery demanded by god is truly monumental. Believers are required to sacrifice two lambs day-by-day continuously – and that’s just for starters! Just as well Yahweh had several thousand priests to help him trough through the banquet! Livestock bears the brunt of god’s appetite but humans could so easily get the chop from the big guy. God kills Uzzah for simply steadying the tumbling Ark (1Chronicles 13.9,10). Poor Onan was zapped for using the withdrawal method of birth control (Genesis 38.10). But such isolated vindictiveness palls in comparison with the mass killings of the Lord. When the autocratic Moses faces a rebellion led by Korah, God uses an earthquake and fire to consume two hundred and fifty rebels. When indignant sympathizers protest at the injustice, God wipes out another fourteen thousand seven hundred with a plague (Numbers 16). What a guy!</p>

<p>&quot;God  put Abraham to the test ... Abraham built an altar ... bound Isaac hand &amp; foot ... took the slaughtering  knife to kill his son ... But the angel of the Lord  began calling ... &#39;Do not put out your hand against the boy .... for now I know that you fear the Lord ...&#39;  (Genesis 22.1,12)</p>

<p>Abraham was praised for his willingness to appease Yahweh by killing his own son. The sham murder of Isaac (the &#39;Aquedah&#39;) was the prototype for a &#39;redemptive sacrificial death&#39; subsequently re-worked as the crucified Jesus.</p>

<p>&quot;And Saul defeated the Amalekites … and devoted to destruction all the people  … But Saul spared Agag and … all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction. And Samuel said, &quot;What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?&quot; … Then Samuel said, &quot;Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.&quot; And Agag came to him cheerfully … And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.&quot; – 1 Samuel 15</p>

<p>When the Lord says kill everyone He means EVERYONE!</p>

<p>The LORD delivers 10,000 Canaanites and Perizzites for slaughter in Bezek. As part of the fun 71 kings have their thumbs and big toes cut off. (Judges 1.2,7)</p>

<p>Female fan of Yahweh drives tent peg into head of sleeping Canaanite general. (Judges 4.21)</p>

<p>Elisha orders the assassination of Jezebel. (2 Kings 9,5,37)</p>

<p>Elijah Murders 450 Priests of Baal. (1 Kings 18.40)</p>

<p>Joshua Slaughters 31 kings (Joshua 12.1,24)</p>

<p>Samson Slays 1000 Philistines (with an ass&#39;s jawbone! ) Judges 15.16)</p>

<p>King Amaziah of Judah (c. 801–783 BC) throws 10,000 captive Edomites from the top of a rock. (2 Chronicles 25.12)</p>

<p>Usurper Jehu tricks all the priests of Baal into temple slaughter. (2 Kings 10.19.30)  </p>

<p>In Joshua’s  (supposed) wars of conquest, God gets right in there. He throws down ‘great stones from heaven’ (Joshua 10.11) and scores a better body-count than his Israelites with mere swords. When the Lord gets up a real head of steam the slaughter reaches a truly epic scale. For merely looking into his Ark,Yahweh wipes out fifty thousand and seventy unfortunate men of Bethshemesh (1 Samuel 6.19). When King David slips up and orders a national census, an enraged God  zaps seventy thousand. Quite apart from the celestial superman’s own killing, he animates his favourites into wiping out whole cities and nations. Jericho, Sodom, Gomorrah, Ai, Makkedah, Libnah etc., etc., are ‘smote and consumed’ – men, women, young, old, ox, sheep and ass! You shall annihilate them - Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites – as Yahweh your God commanded you.’ 
– Deuteronomy 20.11,18.</p>

<p>In the largest  single god-inspired massacre in the Bible, one million Ethiopians are slaughtered! (2 Chronicles 14). But then we  have been warned!   </p>

<p>All this carnage, of course, is allegorical, albeit that certain stories may have a tenuous link with an ancient skirmish somewhere. The point  is to terrify people into obedience of the priesthood. Moses’ is an archetypal ‘wise priest’, who rules with a rod of  iron and brooks no opposition. ‘Take heed’ is  the warning. ‘Look what happens when you disobey the word of the Lord!’      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m familiar with this. Recently I was researching how the Phoenicians had mixed with the watchers at Mount Hermon. There were the Rephaim, Anakim, Zuzim, and Emim. Phoenicia means land of the Phoenix. I made a post about spiders yesterday and how the masons worship Jahbulon. Hardin Abif was said to have been a Phoenician who built Solomons Temple. Apparently Moses&#39; spies returned from the land of Canaan and reported that the land was full of huge people that looked like grasshoppers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a pretty good post I think good of you to site all the verses. I think that <a href="/u/EagleOfAmerica">/u/EagleOfAmerica</a>  is right for the most part. There are versions of giants and vampires in nearly every culture in the world and within every legend is a grain of truth. I am sure there was generical old fashioned tribal wars that took place over land or power but there was evil being purged from the planet also. God was trying to erase every trace of the nephelim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a religious person, I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for a person to <em>not</em> have a religion. Isn&#39;t it simply a set of beliefs, a worldview, values, etc? Even cosmic ideas of origin and the hereafter? </p>

<p>Atheists are very religious. Communists even more so with their cult of state and personality. </p>

<p>I guess the word, <em>religion;</em> comes from rules and we all follow internal rules whether or not we believe those come from a deity or from the particular sect of society we associate with. </p>

<p>Yahweh is my God. It&#39;s my understanding that he had some stuff to do to make a clean place to incarnate into the world to save it. Much of that was genetic cleansing - getting rid of all the giants, the Nephilim hybrids and whatnot. </p>

<p>He marched the Hebrews round and round, told them what to wear, what to eat, who to kill, etc. Bloodlines were super important or a reason - he was going to be born of a virgin of their people. So he selected Abraham, whipped his people into shape, cleared out all the abominations, even brought peace to most of the world in the Pax Romana, and having winnowed his people to perfection in Mary, incarnated as Jesus. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s all a conspiracy, then what exactly <em>is</em> the conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. When I was an atheist, my religion was scientism, although I didn&#39;t even realize it. The man in the lab coat says that there is no God, so there must be no God. The universe and earth, a cosmic accident, and by chance, we evolved from monkeys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not against religion, but I do think that the early christians were Gnostics, until the Roman Empire killed many of them and infiltrated the movement to centralize the power of the State in it i.e. The creation of the Vatican Church and Constantines conversion. The whole message of Gnosticism is that humanity has been deceived by the god of the Old Testament, which is why I&#39;ve collected these verses. I think the Vatican is part of the machine that seeks to trap humanity in the material preventing them from reaching spiritual divinity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting account of <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?c=Earth+History&amp;amp;su=Yahweh%E2%80%99s+Efforts#Yahweh%E2%80%99s+Efforts">Yahweh&#39;s efforts</a> can be found in the Law of One.</p>

<p>To summarize, &#39;Yahweh&#39; was an ET who cam to Earth to improve the genetic &#39;stock&#39; of humanity, in order to provide a better foundation for spiritual development.</p>

<p>These offspring were smarter, larger, taller than others. They were called the Anak. Their language was ancient Hebrew.</p>

<p>Later, another ET from the Orion group impersonated Yahweh and convinced the Anak that they were an &#39;elite&#39; amongst humanity, and led them to wage destructive &#39;holy wars&#39; against other peoples. (The Orion group is thought to be the same reptilian ET group that is still active today.)</p>

<p>It is still today a common method of controlling people. Just convince those who are smarter, wealthier, etc, that they are an &#39;elite&#39;, and they can be more easily used to act negatively towards others.  </p>
