        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">645</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/005A9C.html">005A9C</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 2013, when Obama passed our defense budget, they snuck in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5736/text">Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012</a>.</p>

<p>Now what does this do? Well here is the TL;DR</p>

<p>It allows materials produced by the Board of Broadcasting Governance and The State Department to be released in the USA.</p>

<p>The BBG and State Department used to be one entity, United States Information Agency. What was the purpose of the USIA? Public diplomacy. Sounds good, yeah? Howaboutno.jpg.</p>

<p>Public diplomacy is the communication with and <strong>dissemination of propaganda</strong> to foreign public to establish a dialogue <strong>designed</strong> to inform and <strong>influence.</strong> (except this is now also allowed within US Borders)</p>

<p>This means our news and media outlets are free to spread propaganda in America, which was made illegal after WW2... due to the &#39;Big Lie&#39;.</p>

<p>Those that do not know, the &#39;Big Lie&#39; is a propaganda technique used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi&#39;s. What is it? Well simple, a Big Ass Lie.... coined by Adolf himself. Look what he did to Germany with the Big Lie and how he rallied everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The use of a lie so &quot;colossal&quot; that no one would believe that someone &quot;could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.&quot;</p>

<p>in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</p>

<p>It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.
— Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, vol. I, ch. X</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principle is sometimes translated and abbreviated as the pithy saying: &quot;Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>So where are we at now? Feels &gt; Facts. Astroturfing. Every news outlet blasting us with the same shit till we puke. Don&#39;t forget facebook/twitter and the like control their news and the narrative.</p>

<p>Well, the media shoved &quot;Trump is a racist fascist xenophobic rapist pedo&quot; for about a month, didn&#39;t work to well.</p>

<p>The media shoved &quot;RUSSIA&quot; down our throats for like 4 months... nothing happened, didn&#39;t stick. They tried.</p>

<p>The media is now shoving &quot;nazi nazi nazi white nationalist&quot; down our throats.... lets see how long it lasts before it just disappears, like the other two.</p>

<p>Asking for proof about the above always resulted in downvotes, angry responses and hostility. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6ulp2d/fans_outside_barclays_center_protesting_demand/dltvhz2/">Check it out</a> See, I can provide proof of things, why can&#39;t anyone else?</p>

<p>Every outlet just blasts this stuff without actual proof, just twisting words and omitting information. Ala propaganda.</p>

<p>This is just what I remember and still experience, especially on here. Just asking for proof. If it wasn&#39;t a lie and it was true, why not put it out there?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now, this could also tie into other conspiracies as well.</p>

<p>Jews run the media/government? If that conspiracy were true, then the story from Hitler about the origin of the Big Lie could also be true, or the Jewish people running the country are taking what Hitler did and using it themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler claimed the technique was used by &quot;the Jews&quot; to blame Germany&#39;s loss in World War I on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist and antisemitic political leader in the Weimar Republic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if this is true, this could link many conspiracies into one big ass one.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Oh and if you are wondering how this conspiracy came up, well, look at the blatantly &#39;blue&#39; media, <strong>almost</strong> every news station leans left except fox... </p>

<p>So what? Well, the BBG...</p>

<p>Current CEO is a pro in broadcasting. Very useful for spreading propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he is credited with guiding the company to become a leading developer of unique content across various media platforms including television, digital, mobile and publishing.</p>

<p>Most recently, Lansing was President and Chief Executive Officer of Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association for Marketing (CTAM), a marketing association comprised of 90 of the top U.S. and Canadian cable companies and television programmers. There, Lansing oversaw the development of business strategies and marketing initiatives that position cable television companies for continued growth as they compete with emerging digital content platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The BBG CEO is appointed by the president... as is all 8 members of the board, the 9th is the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>All 8 members of the board were appointed by Obama in 2013 and 2014, all following the signing of the NDAA which allowed propaganda.</p>

<p>The following are who is in charge <sup><sup>of</sup></sup> <sup><sup>propaganda</sup></sup> according to the NDAA - <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5736/text">Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012</a>.</p>

<p>Karen Kornbluh - Democrat - A senior adviser to Barack Obama from the beginning of his Senate tenure throughout his 2008 presidential campaign, she has been called &quot;Obama&#39;s brain&quot;. Senior Fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>Jeff Shell - CEO of Universal Pictures, answers to his boss, Steve Burke CEO of Comcast Xfinity.</p>

<p>Michael Kempner -  founder, President, and CEO of MWWPR, a public relations firm headquartered in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Kempner is also known for his political contributions and fundraising for the Democratic Party. Fourth largest PR firm in the country AND scum as fuck - <strong>In 2012, MWWPR received media attention for a campaign on behalf of Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair, a former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne Division charged with forcible sodomy and sexual misconduct. The firm launched a website with publicly available documents in favor of Sinclair to discredit the prosecutor and accuser. MWWPR nominated itself for a Platinum PR Award in the crisis management category for this work</strong></p>

<p>John Crocker - Honestly, rather upstanding appointment, life long career diplomat, except one thing... In December 2013, he voiced his opinion that America should quietly work with the Syrian government, despite its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, as a lesser of the evils.</p>

<p>Dr. Leon Aron - has a B.A. from Moscow State Pedagogical Institute, an M.A in media sociology, and a Ph.D. in political sociology from Columbia University. He left Russia on the late 70&#39;s and doesn&#39;t like Putin. I mean, I don&#39;t either, but we can see how this might be conflicting. Right? His work has been on &quot;Liberal&quot; medias, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Foreign Policy, The Weekly Standard, and CNN......................... but the most <strong>interesting thing is this</strong> -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t expect a new détente between Russia and the West</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting, he said this July 27th 2016. Lo and behold, our media has been making everything anti-russia and all about russia. What a coincidence. Detente means, by the way, an ease in hostility. Strange how someone on the board of an approved propaganda company <strong>knows</strong> there wont be an ease in hostility.</p>

<p>Last - Kenneth Weinstein - CEO of Hudson Institute which is a think tank that has a little history in taking money from companies, well one that we know of, Monstano. NBD yeah? Well Hudson Institute was attacking organic farming even though it only accounted for 1% of food sales. Mr. Weinstein dodged a question as to whether the donations to his think tank should be disclosed or not. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Well, that is what I got, I was really high, this was fun to do and interesting to think about while watching Defenders.</p>

If the mainstream media is now free to use propaganda, do you think that the manipulative fucks putting it out there are <em>for</em> or <em>against</em> Donald Trump?

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear that there is a divide in the media supporting and opposing Trump and it falls along the same political lines that the media has been on for decades.</p>

<p>That depends which media you are referring to. The conservative media? Of course. The liberal media? Of course not.</p>

But online each propagandist can manage thousands of names, completely fabricate a narrative while it looks like people are having a discussion. This is all too obvious on reddit.</p>

<p>They have an agenda. That&#39;s why they don&#39;t balance it or tell the complete truth. They&#39;re pushing an agenda. Their agenda isn&#39;t to educate, it&#39;s to spread propaganda and misinformation disguised as education. </p>

<p>The facts are: REPUBLICANS created PATRIOT ACT and the <em>entire</em> surveillance state. They are <em>continually</em> trying to expand the scope of federal power to arrest w/o trial, spy on citizens and drown you in propaganda.</p>

<p>Democrats are signing on to these bills and providing the republicans with support. They&#39;re complicit but they&#39;re not the ones plunging the knife into your chest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s statement:</p>

<p>&quot;Those that do not know, the &#39;Big Lie&#39; is a propaganda technique used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi&#39;s. What is it? Well simple, a Big Ass Lie.... coined by Adolf himself.&quot;</p>

<p>That actually was a new phrase applied by Josef Goebbels to Edward Bernay&#39;s work in the United States for the American Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Josef Goebbels was a fan/follower of Bernay&#39;s work in the United States.</p>

<p>Bernays was Sigmund Freud&#39;s nephew.</p>

<p>Bernays dictated American propaganda for over 4 decades from an entire floor of a New York highrise. He wrote the first definitive book on it called Propaganda &amp; renamed it &quot;Public Relations&quot; which was the big start in the United States in the softening of words to describe harsh tactics.</p>

<p>For the curious the Adam Curtis documentary called The Century of Self is available in multiple parts via Youtube. It is an eye opener to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Thats how they shutdown the socialist uprising after the Great Depression &amp; that&#39;s how they did it this last presidential election.</p>

<p>They clamped down mass media so most people never saw the huge lines of people queued up for miles in the rain, sleet &amp; snow to see Sanders speak.</p>

<p>Then Trump copied Sanders stump speech almost verbatim &amp; added the Wall shit to distinguish himself.</p>

<p>Never in history has the mass corporate media allowed a candidate to speak on the air for so many hours week after week.</p>

<p>It was all to divert attention away from the socialist drawing huge crowds.</p>

<p>Most people never will know that happened unless they stumbled across the huge crowd videos on Youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A conspiracy theory that absolves Trump from any personal failings (despite them being numerous and obvious), sweeps any talk of Russia under the rug (despite evidence released and confirmed by the Trump camp itself), and promotes your friendly local neo-nazi group (and then blames Jews for everything in the same breath).</p>

<p>What a shocking development for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Perhaps the OP should use this as his resume when he applies for the ministry of propaganda himself.</p>

<p>No.  I was a very vocal opponent of attacking Iraq, and could not believe the rush to a seeming consensus to attack a country based on obvious lies.  For pointing this out, I was called every name in the book.  </p>

<p>Everyone was not gung ho for the needless war... it only seems that way because there were so few voices of reason who saw what would happen.  I&#39;m sorry not enough was done to keep you and others like you from having to go through that.</p>
