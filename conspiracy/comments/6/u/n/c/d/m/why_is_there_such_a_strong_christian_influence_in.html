<p>What does Capitolism have to do with this, and are you aware that <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2017/02/15/americans-express-increasingly-warm-feelings-toward-religious-groups/">atheism is not popular at all in America?</a> Our kids are hardly being indoctrinated, and even if they were, Christians vastly outnumber that group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This meme that Christianity commands blind faith has no connection to the Bible or the early church.</p>

<p>Christianity explicitly commands critical thinking about any religious claims that someone makes (1 Thessalonians 5:21), and it encourages each person to critically examine what their leaders are saying.</p>

<p>This is why the corrupted Catholic Church literally burned people at the stake for owning a Bible. They didn&#39;t want the real teachings to get out, so they could keep charging indulgences.</p>

Try another church and see if you can find more faithful hearts. Gather a few likeminded and be a church to each other. Frankly, I think this may be happening a lot.  Grace and peace to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rationalist Pagan, here. Sorry to have proven you wrong.</p>

<p>And if the name of my conviction is confusing as all hell, I can define it for you.</p>

<p>A Rationalist Pagan is somebody who has taken the core ideologies of a favored sect of Paganism and does not see their &quot;deities&quot; as  such, but more of paradigms of being, self, and thought. We embrace both sides of the faith argument. Faith fuels us, Logic and Reason guides us. </p>

<p>To us, Magick is nothing more than sciences that have not been discovered to have a repeatable, consistent mode of operation. a standard model of physics that goes beyond physics and yet follows what we know. Metaphysics.</p>

<p>Any sufficiently advanced understanding, technology, or science might as well be Magick to the common person.</p>

<p>One day, the people of Earth will bridge this gap and find a way, a means, to break the veil of shadows keeping us from this lost science, and shit you see in the movies might happen. Won&#39;t be in my lifetime, sure as hell ain&#39;t gonna be yours. But it&#39;s going to happen one day.</p>

<p>and when the veil breaks for good and the other side of &quot;reality&quot; as we know it is laid bare for everybody to see, the world is going to change. for good or bad, i do not know, but it is going to change.</p>

<p>what many people keep forgetting is that ultimately, all paths are a way to God, whatever you may call it or disavow, we <em>will</em> meet our makers one day, and everybody who kept vehemently denying the ultimate truth that our existence is too perfectly chanced, too goldilocks&#39;d, for the human race to be a fucking accident and we ain&#39;t alone.</p>

<p>mark my words.</p>

<p>sorry for ranting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When a red bull is sacrificed at the Dome of the Rock, Armageddon will begin, apparently. I don&#39;t believe it but I&#39;m sure plenty of people do. Religious texts are all very easy to read whatever your belief is into, so I think that helps a lot.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the tendency for conspiracy theorists to find comfort in a general overlying Plan - it&#39;s hard to accept that sometimes bad things just happen, so if it&#39;s God or the Jews or the Rothschilds or the Aryans hatching some secret plot, it&#39;s easier to digest. Nevermind that something like 9/11 would require a huge number of people to pull off and the American government is barely functioning at this point and leaking like a sieve.</p>

<p>What if I told you the Tolkien was part of a literary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings">society</a>, along with CS Lewis, that exposed the deeds of darkness? And that the Lord of the Rings is an expose on Freemasonry (two towers, all-seeing Eye of Sauron) and secret societies?

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has to do with the fact that there is a lot of evidence of satanic worship among the elite.  You can think that this is some sort of doctrine to excuse their actions but that assumes a conscience.   The powerful would not partake in this if there was nothing really to it. There is power drawn from the sacrifice of innocence which is the base of these rituals. The purity we are born with has an non quantifiable aspect that has a potential we rarely unlock, evil feeds on the destruction of this innocence. Once Satan becomes more than a boogy man it is easier become open to the idea of God. When you see the world as one under dominion of evil, and love being in direct opposition Christianity can make more sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When conspiracies involve rich powerful child eating secret societies sacrificing people to ancient gods it draws a lot of people who have some religious background to say well that makes sense because you know the devil and all that. Other people who might be skeptical but not hard core atheist or antitheist to say well maybe there might be something to this whole thing after all. Also there are conspiracies like ancient advanced human civilization like the Shakespeare equation or the secrets of the great pyramids that lead others to the conclusion that there is something bigger than us or it&#39;s all part of a plan. I come from a Christian background though I am just another heretic lost once Christian so I see all this stuff and see it&#39;s all connected, all of it. Everything everyone is doing of their own free will is happening exactly like it was supposed to happen. Prophecy is self fulfilling the path we take to avoid our destiny is the road we often meet it on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When countries are set up and religion is the basis for the functionality of that country a party is formed.  </p>

<p>When another frame of thinking comes along after struggles have subsided and they want to change the country in ways to expand to other countries, a different ideal is created. </p>

<p>Conspiracy thinkers want freedom from control.  The starter seeks to control and part of that control is a coordinated attack on religion in order to destabilize any validity left in our current culture. </p>

<p>The overwhelming evidence of this prompts conspiracy thinkers to look at what is being hidden and it ultimately is leading to a new understanding of old religions and ancient civilizations that comes to the conclusion that God has been covered up.</p>

<p>Many are coming to this conclusion even past their own atheism through their research and discussions.  </p>

<p>That is why it seems like Christianity is behind it.   Christianity is the first religion that hacks the secret mystery schools information and turns it back into a grassroots movement based on finding personal spirituality. </p>

<p>Jesus came around and re-corrected the path of Christianity as they tried to evolve it into a controlled hierarchy. He was the first to come to the realizations of this world outside of the secret agenda of Babylon that has alway held the reigns of this planet.  </p>

<p>The history leads us all to this discussion. It&#39;s not that everyone is a Christian, it&#39;s that everyone sees the effort to kill god.  </p>
