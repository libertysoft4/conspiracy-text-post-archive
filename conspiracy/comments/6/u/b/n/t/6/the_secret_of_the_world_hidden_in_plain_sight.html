    <div class="md"><p>The flood myth keeps popping up in so many different cultures, with so many common themes, it&#39;s hard to explain away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with the timeline of the bible, or the narrative surrounding the flood, but it seems there may be some amount of truth to it.</p>

<p>The process shown here takes place over a few hundred million years, so it&#39;s not quite the same, but it does leave lots of opportunities for widespread flooding, if there was a sudden &quot;busting loose&quot; of these continental plates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always found interesting that the strata in the fossil record are organized by density; like if you put sand, gravel, clay in a bucket, added water, mixed it up and let it settle.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, there are up-side-down trees and fossils that are in multiple layers of strata simultaneously.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t fit the long-narrative.</p>

<p>Interesting indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I think it&#39;s called gradualism, if I remember right.  The notion that everything is just a long, slow process.  It&#39;s not a terrible concept, but people who use it seem to shut themselves off to the idea that big geographical changes can happen suddenly, and dramatically.  The grand canyon is more likely to have formed from sudden glacial flooding runoff, than gradual erosion from a river.  If it was slowly carved out by a river, why don&#39;t all of our major rivers have huge canyons on them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a mineral called ringwoodite located below the crust. This mineral contains water within it&#39;s structure. it&#39;s believed that there is more water contained within ringwoodite deposits than in all the world&#39;s oceans.</p>

<p>So I can&#39;t comment on how this mineral could act as a source of water, or maybe soak it up after a flood is over. But it seems like there are still some things we don&#39;t know about yet.</p>

<p>Things that could make all those old Flood stories a lot more plausible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the excellent diagram, it does a really nice job of delivering the concept.</p>

<p>A couple of thoughts here.</p>

<p>One is that this reminds me of Genesis 7:11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the six hundredth year of Noah&#39;s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One, it let&#39;s you know that the rain and the breaking up of the &quot;founts of the great deep&quot; happening at the roughly same time... &quot;the same day&quot;. To me, this suggests both events were triggered by a common cause. Descriptive language also implies that it started abruptly. </p>

<p>Opening a window does not take very long.</p>

<p>So really, there&#39;s only thing standing between Noah&#39;s Flood seen as mythology vs seen as folk history of an actual event. Is there a known physical process that could explain vast quantities of water being released (Great Flood) and reabsorbed (waters were dried up from off the the earth)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like something happened that suddenly decreased the Ringwoodite&#39;s ability to retain water. But then, after a period of time, the water either went back where it came from or it didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Geology and archaeology both show us that sea levels have been much lower in the past. As much as 300 feet lower during the last ice age. If the water of the Flood stayed about ground, the polar ice caps are one possible place it might have gone. But I just don&#39;t see that much water transferred to the poles (by snowfall or rain) in just one year.</p>

<p>So that brings us to another possibility, the Ringwoodite. I&#39;m thinking of chemical equilibrium. If some condition changed the balance between water and mineral.</p>

<p>Maybe a change in magnetic field? Maybe some kind of vibration? Electric Universe theory says the Earth has natural electrical characteristics that are in a balance with those of the Sun. So maybe something that originated with the Sun affected the Earth (a huge energy transfer of some sort) causing all the water to be released.</p>

<p>Energy transfer event was transient and so were the effects. Rain eventually stopped and the waters receded (literally) off the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>Right now, the only difference I still have with the Biblical account is on the number of survivors. Noah refers to the man himself, but also can symbolize a very small group of survivors and wildlife. It seems at least possible that there were other groups of people who knew a Flood was coming and took steps to ensure their own survival.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genesis 6 in the Bible, as well as many other flood myths, do point to worldwide floods and other geological events about six millenia ago or so. But the Bible is significantly distorted.</p>

<p>&quot;A worldwide flood happened, therefore Jesus Christ died for our sins and is the son of God [Yahweh]. If you accept this, you will gain eternal life, but if you reject this, you will go to hell [or just not gain eternal life].&quot;</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t use the evidence of large amounts of recently deposited tsunami sediment just south of the Himalayas to prove Christianity true, if I were an honest Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a theory that the earth could be hollow. If so, then expanding earth is no problem from that standpoint. It would work kind of like a balloon.</p>

<p>The next question the becomes well what is gravity in that case. It may be that we do not understand gravity either. And if the earth was hollow, then the current theories of gravity would also prove to be wrong. </p>

<p>The proponents of the Electric Universe theorizes that this is the case; we have gotten gravity wrong, and in fact modern consensus science can not fully explain gravity at the moment (see the problem of Dark Matter for example).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wouldn&#39;t have to overhaul ideas of gravity, for a hollow earth, but some things would surely change.  Big G would be different, but wouldn&#39;t be a bid deal, since hollow earth theory proposes that all planets are hollow, more or less.  The distance/strength equation for calculating gravity might need some mathematical tweaks too, but nothing earth shattering.</p>

<p>A big issue with hollow earth that people get hung up on is planet formation.  They assume that accretion is the &quot;standard&quot; way that planets form, so hollow earth seems to go against that.  But accretion is a terribly flawed theory, and there has never been a working model that can make it work.  There is no explanation or observation for how space debris would attract, at less than ~1000k diameter.  (I think that&#39;s the number.  Can&#39;t look it up now.)</p>

<p>Maybe later, when I&#39;m not on phone data, I&#39;ll put up the yotube video that illustrates my personal theory of planet formation.  It&#39;s based off of the nasa video of a small, floating ball of water at zero g, with tea leaves and gass bubbles injected in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t become  &quot;a secret&quot; until after WWII. As a matter of fact, even without the mapping of the age of the ocean floor in more recent times to only further confirm it, the &quot;Expanding Earth Theory&quot; actually seemed to be the most logical and well accepted one among many of the world&#39;s best and most respected geologists.</p>

<p>There were even models showing that growth over time in many prominent museums and universities all over the world. </p>

<p>So what happened? </p>

<p>Some American scientists with all the usual hoopla and barrage of media propaganda behind them introduced their notion of &quot;Plate Tectonics&quot; and the highly credible theory that the Earth had physically expanded to it&#39;s present size and was and likely still is at some small and barely measurable rate was basically ridiculed out of existence and what was easy enough to conceive based on the present reality was suddenly branded as being &quot;inconceivable&quot; and a theory that only &quot;crackpots&quot; could possibly believe.</p>

<p>And so the more credible explanation was pressured out of mind and sight by one that actually had more holes and inconsistencies in the whole notion of what was re-labelled, became known, and was subsequently taught to us as &quot;continental drift&quot;, with no mention at all regarding what was commonly believed prior to that.</p>

<p>And yet the idea that the continents all fit almost perfectly together never eluded any of us as curious children trying to come to grips with this so-called planet we live on, only to be told that we were wrong and couldn&#39;t trust our own eyes in regards to just how obvious that appeared to be. Were we being deliberately lied to?</p>

<p>Let me simply ask any of you, hasn&#39;t the purely materialistic rationale of the Newtonian science we were all taught <em>as if</em> it was completely true and unassailable, not been wrong about all kinds of primary and important things that it equally removed, destroyed, or ridiculed all the previous evidence that supported alternate and even more logical explanations for simply because they weren&#39;t completely materialistic interpretations?</p>

<p>Is energy a property of matter or is all matter not simply an expression of perpetually moving quantum energies that aren&#39;t simply restricted to the three dimensions that their motions create and substantiate the life of all that matter in?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting take on the history of the theory.  I hadn&#39;t heard it that way.</p>

<p>And yeah.  It seems that &quot;science&quot; is used sometimes as a useful way to analyze the world around us, and other times it chains us down to a set of preconceived notions, which we don&#39;t want to change.  I say &quot;science&quot;, because a lot of what people call science these days isn&#39;t science at all, but dogma.</p>

I immediately respond with... scientifically proven doesn&#39;t mean fucking shit. It is almost able to swapped with anything a closed minded religious folk has to offer for a response.  </p>

<p>If i even mention the fact that some of the scientists that we treasure and love were completely farce and stole their work or had their wives do it they fucking flip their shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the real mystery of it, and it stops alot of people from buying in.  There are tons of different theories, of varying credibility.  Some even tie in hollow earth theory, but I think it&#39;s better to focus on one problem at a time.</p>

<p>Some think it could be a chemical reaction at the (frozen) core, H and O combining to make water.  Some say that Earth could be collecting matter/debris from space.  Both of these have some problems.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t pretend to know, but I do have a ridiculously unprovable theory, that the earth (and other bodies) could be some sort of living organism.  It would be a biological source for water, oil, and other substances.  But this is more based on other &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;esoteric&quot; thoughts, not very scientific at all.  Yet :)</p>

<p>Well...  We have <em>ideas</em>, but nothing testable or provable yet.  There aren&#39;t many researchers looking for the answer to that question, since they&#39;re unwilling to even acknowledge the possibility.  It&#39;s a shame.</p>
