<p>I have noticed an uptick in defense of white nationalism in this sub and frankly, it scares me.  We all should know about the role of the internet in radicalizing people into things like ISIS, and I am legitimately concerned that the same thing is happening with the alt right and white nationalism groups.  Antifa is as well, I can&#39;t deny that, but I don&#39;t see much about &#39;bash the fash&#39; here.</p>

<p>What can be done about this?  Is this a legit movement and am I seeing a conspiracy where there isn&#39;t one?  If so, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many white nationalist posts have you seen? There&#39;s one that I know of today, specifically white pride. I found it to be relatively insightful and carefully worded. There are lots of racial issues floating around. This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean everyone&#39;s view point is evil, ignorant, or wrong. Our culture patronizes non-whites for no damn reason, creating a double standard when it comes to issues of race. In reality, racial lines have been blurred for a while now and genetics isn&#39;t as important as environment. White privilege means nothing to an overweight 16 year old raising a kid by her self in a trailer out in rural West Virginia somewhere.</p>

<p>In my opinion, people should feel free to express themselves. Good ideas float to the top. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I&#39;ve seen quite a bit.  Keep in mind that my concern is with white nationalists infiltrating this sub, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m concerned.  I&#39;ve seen some with the people who are feeling that white history is important to keep in parks, and yet will not feel the same about Black History Month.  I&#39;ve seen it in those who are dismissing people counter demonstrating against white nationalist ralles and by saying that they all must be shills.  I agree that people must be able to express themselves, hence why I made this post.</p>

At least how I view it, from my own self determination of my own biased feelings.

<p>And for the record, CIA, if you are paying people to be liberal shills like I&#39;ve been accused of, I am totally down with being paid.  Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was the same as you and worse - more like these antifa people in my opinions about racists. But I found that zealots accomplish nothing but making matters worse and learned it&#39;s better to win people to your cause than push them in a corner. But either way - I am an artist/musician and my first and main concern over every other issue is free speech. The Left as I knew it and identified as being a part of is dead.

They want to make the US isolationists and incite racial tensions.  The far right is being used in a major way.  Russia has a strategy that they have employed to do so.  This used to appear as a free thought platform but it is not as much if it really ever was.  Now they will brigade anyone who disagrees and call them shills.  Free thought was lost in the process because they have their leader.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the shitty thing though.   I had a thought earlier today that a big part of seeing conspiracies involves setting pure rationalism to the side and accepting the idea that if one thing means another, such and such must be true.  It requires creativity in thought, but it also means that a group who are avle to set aside rationality to consider something new might also be the most fertile ground to plant your ideas.</p>

Rather go to tour neighbors; see how theyre doing. Get to know your local community and the guy next door. Its kinda crazy how all the Nazi&#39;s and racism largely disappear when you unplug.</p>

<p>Those statues have a place in history even as a warning of what not to become. If we don&#39;t listen to history we repeat it. I mean shit my state still celebrates Victory day (ie victory over japan) on the outside it may seem racist like we&#39;re celebrating the death of the Japanese but it serves as a memorial of great sacrifice and the horrors of war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in small town Nebraska, to give context.  My neighbors all voted for Trump.  I have had children show up to my house in actual blackface (as football players) two out of the two years I have lived in my house.  I know many Trump supporters that I like and genuinely respect as human beings.  And I have talked to many of them.  All that I have talked to have expressed regret over the trans ban and are legitimately disgusted by what happened in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>These are people that I talk to about how I feel that the $15 minimum wage is stupid but that late term abortion is important for medical reasons.  We are able to talk about issues and come to a consensus because, well, we&#39;re grown ass adults.  </p>

<p>And most of them are sick of being construed as conservative and white nationalist.  They might care about immigration, but they don&#39;t care about civil rights statues and they don&#39;t like that those people are considered the Right.</p>

<p>Confederate monuments glorify a nation that was created with the primary purpose of preserving the enslavement of blacks.  Most of these monuments were erected during a time of racial oppression, and served as a message to blacks that those in power were hostile to them.  Their continued existence emboldens white supremacists, who take them as evidence that their views are widespread and hence justified.</p>

<p>I used the hypothetical of a Hitler monument in Germany, because the existence of such a thing, even to the dumbest individual, would obviously be seen as a message to Jews that they are second-class citizens.  Nazi Germany is a symbol of the oppression of Jews.  The Confederacy is a symbol of the oppression of blacks.</p>

<p>I consider myself a nationalist (I also happen to be white but don&#39;t consider it important to my identity) and disagree with this. It&#39;s not entirely wrong in that I believe only citizens (you could consider that my &quot;group,&quot; but I believe you were implying something more racial) should have control of their countries but I don&#39;t want to end immigration. The immigration policy should be one that benefits the citizens that are here, by taking immigrants with skills in critical locations who can do things the current citizens can&#39;t meet the demand of.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a citizen, you&#39;re an equal. If you&#39;re a tourist, you&#39;re a guest. If you&#39;re living here illegally, you have to go back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue with nationalism in terms of immigration is that it is very, very hard for people to approve people in a way that is truly unbiased, given our natural proclivities to classism and racism.  Humans are shit at not letting those biases slip into our daily lives, we just are.  So with immigration... how do we judge?  We have to take a hard look into our biases when we do so.  We also need to have expanded green card programs so people can come here to work more easily and go back home.  if we tighten up on this like we are, we&#39;re just pretending like people don&#39;t stay beyond their green card and we penalize those people who can&#39;t go hope but cant stay here by not allowing them to report crimes out of fear of being illegal.  I&#39;m a liberal, dude.  But I also have rational feelings about immigration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, why not?  To pick up on your post before, my big issue with the points thing is that it seems deeply classist.  It favors professionals with money and specifically, the money to have and keep documentation.  My ancestors came to this country with nothing.  It seems fair to allow the same for others.</p>

<p>As for your question here.  My big problem with it is that in a perfect world where the outcome is guaranteed, I&#39;d absolutely pick pain for some then happiness for everyone else.  But, and this is a pretty big but, in the real world, the outcome is never guaranteed.  It&#39;s like how I feel about the death penalty.  If we could know 100% that every person put to death was guilty and that they had been tried completely fairly, I would consider the ability for our government to put people to death.  But we can&#39;t know for sure if someone is actually guilty and has been tried fairly.  As such, I&#39;d way rather have life imprisonment with a chance of being cleared than the more permanent &#39;solution&#39; of death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think about the ties between culture and race? </p>

<p>You would admit that all cultures are different for myriad of ways, aesthetics being architecture, fashion etc, religion, politics, customs, interactions, greetings, how we think about gender, and also thousands of years of biologically divergent evolution because of different climates etc. I think that culture on a global scale is divisible at its smallest by nations, and then by continents. Peoples who share the same continents or at least large areas of several countries have similar characteristics. One of the most similar characteristics is race--Africa majority black, asia majority yellow, europe majority white and the americas more of a mix now because of colonisation. And every region has it. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is do you think race has an effect on how we have created culture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise, bruh.  </p>

<p>The ties between culture and race are incredibly fucking complex, especially in the US.  We have such an integrated culture, like it or not, that we all have to accept things from other cultures in our lives.  For instance, my city in Nebraska has a large Vietnamese community imbedded in to our city that a ton of people here have eaten pho but have never tried Laotian or Cambodian cuisine.  We&#39;ve eaten Southeast Asian food, but only of a certain culture.  We have a narrow viewpoint of Southeast Asia, and it&#39;s from what contact we&#39;ve had.  </p>

<p>However, the Vietnamese restaurants and stores here are still called the &#39;Chinese&#39; stores.  That&#39;s because those stores are Asian and the signs have asiatic language on them so those of us not used to the difference assume that they&#39;re the most common kind of asian person in our mind, aka Chinese.  We assume that because of the color of their skin and their look, and make assumptions based on that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not an issue lone to my city.  It&#39;s an issue with people.  We&#39;re great at judging those who &#39;are different&#39; but we&#39;re terrible at seeing how we treat those people differently.  It&#39;s a person thing and that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to recognize those biases and work through them.</p>

If the left would have stayed home no one would know or care about these fucknuts protesting tearing down a statue.  But instead they catapaulted this into the limelight, and i hate to say it but most people are going to secretly side with anyone but these sandy-vagina liberal pussies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not seen an uptick. Are you conflating condemning both sides for defense of white nationalism?</p>

<p>ISIS likes to take down statues too. They shouldn&#39;t be taken down. At first people start with the controversial figures because those come down easy. Then their opposition targets other statues (like the right targetting the lenin (or is it stalin?) Statue in Washington. Then you have someone defacing the Lincoln Monument in dc.</p>

<p>Once you start that snowball rolling it becomes a tit for tat.</p>

Schwartz who was a card carrying Nazi and we have been here on the Internet for
decades, plotting our Master Plan for the Rise of the 4th Reich in Weimerica! </p>

<p>We massively outnumber you, we have more guns that all of you combined, both
the Military and the Police are loyal to us and not you, and you don&#39;t even
realize our Vast Right Wing Nazi Conspiracy exists because it only became safe
for us to reveal ourselves after our recent Beer Hall Putsch Victory in
Charlottesville. Very soon the Stars Will Be Right and the way will be prepared
for the 12th Imam, the Madhi Hitler2, to unveil himself before the World.</p>

shall have our revenge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s stupid? As is your logic. Just like how the &quot;citizenry&quot; was <em>for</em> slavery. Just because the majority wants it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right. But even in this case, a dozen thugs tearing down statues doesn&#39;t represent the majority. I guarantee you a majority of Charlottesville citizens would not be in favor of tearing history down.</p>
