<p>Every assertion in there is wrong. 
* The UCC has nothing to do with &quot;the law of the sea.&quot; It&#39;s a uniform commercial code for harmonizing rules about leases and such. You can <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc">read it yourself</a> and look for anything having to do with maritime law or special UCC courts. (You won&#39;t, I know, but what the hell, I might as well point it out.) 
* The Organic Act has nothing to do with maritime law or the UCC; the UCC was written about a hundred years after the Organic Act.
* Statutes and codes are laws. Check the books--as in, read a book about law sometime. It&#39;s more accurate than making stuff up as you go along.
* I have never been a member of any private or for-profit bar. (As I know I&#39;ve tried to explain to you before, and you could learn for yourself if you read more, there&#39;s lots of bar associations, not just one.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Former Law Enforcement </li>
<li>Elected Sheriff in AZ for 24 years</li>
<li>Claims Obama&#39;s birth certificate is fake </li>
<li>Accused of abuse of power, misuse of funds, failure to investigate sex crimes, improper clearance of cases, unlawful enforcement of immigration laws, and election law violations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Large part (all sourced from Wikipedia and direct quotes to avoid leaving out important details)
* &quot;A Federal court monitor was appointed to oversee his office&#39;s operations because of complaints of racial profiling. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history, and subsequently filed suit against him for unlawful discriminatory police conduct.&quot;
* &quot;Arpaio was a defendant in a decade-long racial-profiling case in which a federal court issued an injunction barring him from conducting further &quot;immigration round-ups&quot; that targeted Hispanics. A federal court subsequently found that after the order was issued, Arpaio&#39;s office continued to detain &quot;persons for further investigation without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed.&quot; In 2016, Arpaio was held in civil contempt of court, and the following year, Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt of court for &quot;willfully&quot; violating the order&quot;</p>
