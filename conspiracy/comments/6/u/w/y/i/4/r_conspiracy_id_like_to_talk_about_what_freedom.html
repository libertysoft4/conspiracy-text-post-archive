        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings!</p>

<p>I am writing this correspondence to inform people that I am finally disseminating a project that I have been working on for the last few years. I have now published a book that I have written: Of Personal Liberty, The Truth of Motor Vehicle Infractions. If you have any time to spare, I’d greatly appreciate your audience for my work. </p>

<p>What is my book about? Well, first off, I want to assert that my book is NOT a discussion about how to get out of traffic tickets. Rather and more importantly, my book aims to examine the legitimacy of traffic tickets, and in doing so teach people fundamental principles of law that everyone should know.</p>

<p>At its core, my book is a discussion about freedom—in practical use. Specifically, the book enunciates the fact that if a person is free, they don’t need to ask for anyone’s permission before inclining to act. Americans today no longer practice freedom: it is illegal for us to do anything of sustenance unless we first acquire a ‘license’ or ‘permit’ (permission) from the government.</p>

<p>One of the many freedoms that have been deprived from Americans is their right to freely travel upon the highways. For a long time, we have been told that “driving is a privilege”, but this is a grave misnomer. My central thesis is that people should not be forced to obtain a license (ask government’s permission) nor meet other prerequisites before being allowed to privately travel upon the highways. </p>

<p>Our country’s backbone was designed to support a free society. Requiring everyone to get a driver’s license before they can travel upon the highways has led to a form of scoliosis; Constitutional provisions have been grossly reinterpreted, and basic principles of fairness (due process) are being ignored, in order to sustain our current trafficking system.  </p>

<p>I’ve put thousands of hours of work into this book. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am diligent when it comes to my projects. I wouldn’t disseminate a publication unless I felt it met an acceptable standard of quality. I’m ready to share my book for dialectic.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. If you’d like to be the envy of your friends with your legal savvy, if you care about the subject of natural rights, or if you simply need a new coaster for your drinking mug, you should buy a copy of my book. It will be unlike any other book you’ve read. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re traveling on public highways then you&#39;re doing so publicly. If you want to drive privately then get your own road and no one would care if you have a license. </p>

<p>I like knowing that people around me driving 4,000 lbs at 60+ MPH have at least a basic knowledge of how to do so.</p>

<p>Texas is a state, and it has its own state laws. You cited some in that link. &quot;US Code&quot; is federal law. Federal law is not the same thing as state law.</p>

<p>Texas has its own definition of &quot;motor vehicle&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Motor vehicle” means a self-propelled vehicle or a vehicle that is propelled by electric power from overhead trolley wires.  The term does not include an electric bicycle or an electric personal assistive mobility device, as defined by Section 551.201. Texas Transportation Code sec 451.201(11).</p>

<p>Texas requires drivers to have licenses to operate a motor vehicle. The Texas definition of &quot;motor vehicle&quot;, in the same law, applies. </p>

<p>Federal law is irrelevant; there&#39;s no equivalent federal requirement to have a driver&#39;s license, as far as I know, so it has no bearing on state requirements.</p>

<p>What happened to literacy in this country? The answer to &quot;show me a case where this worked&quot; is not, &quot;Watch this hour-long promotional video.&quot; If you can&#39;t find any case where these theories have ever worked, that&#39;s (a) not a surprise, and (b) not my fault.</p>

<p>According to the video&#39;s citations, it only cites <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6741064709248495177&amp;amp;q=7+Cal.App.2d+395&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=6,24">one case</a>, a 1935 California state case about contractor licensing.

<p>Such as? For example? If these laws exist, why can&#39;t anyone ever actually cite one? It&#39;s an urban legend, not a fact. You can tell by the vague hand-waving whenever someone asks for details.</p>

<p>The two big goofs the people behind this myth tend to make are (a) conflating the right to travel with the right to drive, and (b) assuming that there&#39;s an absolute right to drive.</p>

<p>People have the right to travel. The Constitution doesn&#39;t protect a right to travel by any particular method. The states can and do regulate methods, such as by imposing speed limits, weight limits, vehicle safety laws, and requiring drivers&#39; licenses.</p>

<p>There are rights involved with driving. The state can&#39;t arbitrarily deprive one class of people of the right to drive while giving it to another--requiring licenses only for left-handed people would be unconstitutional, for example. But no court has ever found that requiring drivers&#39; licenses is unconstitutional, or that it&#39;s legal to ignore the requirement and drive without one.</p>

<p>And next, we&#39;ll see Putin disagree and fail to find such a case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not at <em>all</em> how law works. Federal definitions don&#39;t trump state definitions unless there&#39;s an equivalent federal law.</p>

<p>If there was a federal drivers&#39; license requirement, it might preempt state laws on the same subject. But there isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a state requirement, governed by state law, and federal laws are irrelevant. that&#39;s why Texas defines &quot;motor vehicle,&quot; rather than just referring to a federal definition.</p>

<p>You know, there are books and classes on law. You could study this stuff, instead of just making it up as you go along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, yes.</p>

<p>My arguments are largely forensic: I put a lot of effort into showing that only way you can truly respect the provisions in the constitutions, state laws, due process, and precedent, without them contradicting one another, is to not mandate licensing for personal travels on the highways. </p>

<p>My book shows case law that say people have access to public highways by right. I put a lot of effort into showing how laws have been reinterpreted in order to accommodate our current traffic-ticketing system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, courts do not respect the fact that people shouldn&#39;t need a license to personally travel on the highways. You cannot use my book to get yourself out of a traffic ticket. However, courts have also said other things that, if you think about them to their logical conclusion, prove contrary to their policy of requiring everyone to get a license. </p>

<p>My book is intended to point out what ought to be, not what currently is. America was founded on fundamental principles; these principles are being routinely violated in the way we administer licenses and traffic tickets. My book attempts to show people what these principles are--in a practical way--and show why we should care about them.</p>

<p>Courts rulings are nothing more than opinions. I&#39;m saying that to the best of my knowledge, someone a long time ago had an erroneous opinion and we&#39;ve gone astray ever since. The only way you can make the &quot;iron sights line up&quot;, the only way that you can simultaneously respect constitutional provisions, principles of due process, and state law, without absurdly redefining everything, is by not requiring everyone to have a license. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I appreciate your clarity here. I see a lot of pseudolegal gurus using similar language to tell people that they can drive <em>now</em> without a license, which is a great way to get gullible people into trouble.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to ask you a question in light of this. Do you think my opening message is enough to separate me from the pseudolegals (in your hindsight?), or do I need to tweak the opening message some? Would you offer any suggestions?</p>

<p>Perhaps you just messaged me to make sure I wasn&#39;t a pseudolegal; if so, that is fine. However, if you did have any interest in reading this book, let me know. I&#39;ll sell you a book at material cost (well, no profit for me anyway) if money is an issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your opening message could be clearer, but at the same time I don&#39;t think many people will notice or care about the potential ambiguity. It&#39;s a particular focus of mine, since I&#39;m so interested in pseudolegal gurus. (Yes, that is why I messaged you.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not particularly interested in the book--no offense to you at all, I&#39;m quite envious that you&#39;ve produced one as I&#39;m working on one of my own. It&#39;s just not a field I have the time or interest to dive into. </p>

<p>I do have some advice, though. A self-published book isn&#39;t going to move the needle much with judges and other lawyers, and if you want to effect a change in the law you&#39;re going to need to persuade some subject-matter experts at some point. (Or, at the very least, doing so would make your job massively easier.)</p>

<p>Have you thought about refining your argument to a good, tight thirty pages and submitting it to law reviews? I think the odds of getting it accepted are fairly slim, but you could submit it around the country easily enough. And you may find yourself in some interesting dialogs with the students who run those journals. Students who will be more receptive to out-of-the-box ideas than established lawyers.</p>

<p>Not a big deal, one way or the other, but that&#39;s what I would do if I were trying to get your message out. Best of luck!</p>

<p>Americans today no longer practice freedom: it is illegal for us to do anything of sustenance unless we first acquire a ‘license’ or ‘permit’ (permission) from the government.</p>

<p>Beautiful, I&#39;ve been making this point for a long time, a permit or license inherently makes that act illegal with permittion from the state.  Even with marrage licenses it&#39;s the same thing, I&#39;d point to the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-defends-denied-interracial-marriage/">2009 incident where a Judge denied a marrage license because the couple were of dirrenent races</a>.  I&#39;ll try to think of it, but there was a guy who had a whole website dedicated to all the court cases where someone sued the state for infringing on their right to us the roads without a license and won... As I recall he was a former sheriff.</p>

<p>A person gets a driver&#39;s license at 16 and never has to take another test or skills update/test UNLESS they show a level of incompetency.</p>

<p>Sure take a written test and road test to show basic competency…period. One should not have to pay yearly for the right to travel on the roads they already paid to build UNLESS they prove to be incompetent.</p>
