        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always wondered if there was a way to make change without pallets full of money, but what if you did have pallets of money? What idea&#39;s or things would you do to stop the corruption? How would you conspire to make the world a better place?</p>

<p>I would personally create a new media platform devoid of the propaganda efforts of my government (USA) so that folks can be informed of the multiple topics that have been manipulated, and &quot;conspiracy&quot; culture can be brought up without the manipulation of the truth. Seeking the truth is a noble cause worth fighting for.</p>

<p>There are a lot smarter people who frequent this board than me and its just we talk about problems so much that I feel thinking up solutions can be beneficial too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>The powerball styled games are, especially with people noticing issues with the live drawings. Scratch offs are more about chance and some people have worked out ways to make some cash back from them VIA saving up and buying large amounts at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Best bet is to not buy lottery and either:
A) Save</p>

<p>B) Look into buying and selling online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just given you 50 billion dollars.  What could possibly make this country stop its steep descent?  Scholarships?  IMO, there is nothing that can turn back the hands of time and right this country.  As Carlin said, we took this pristine country, and turned it into a shitty shopping mall.  Our leaders are corrupt and have been for decades.  The one time we had a decent human being in the oval office, they blew his head off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not scholarships, think more indoctrination. You just gave me 50 billion? I&#39;ll now proceed to start my own studio and air a children&#39;s show online, for free, offering advertisers are chance for product placement to recoup money spent. I&#39;ll hire recognizable names and have them to guest appearances with the usual cast. From there I&#39;ll simply use some simple, subtle cues and wordplay to promote the messages I want to the children watching it.</p>

<p>Children are the future. If you want to change the course of a country, get the children on board. It&#39;s sad to say you have to be just as dirty, to some extent, to fix things due to those currently in control.</p>

Children&#39;s shows won&#39;t stop the military industrial complex and the entrenched fellow billionaires that have other, differing plans for the rest of us.  No matter how much you indoctrinate young people at this point, this country is doomed.  It&#39;s best days are long over.  We can&#39;t even have decent health care for our citizens, and have been at war for nearly two decades with no end in sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are too nearsighted. If you want to change things, to get the next generator involved. If you want to lessen the population, you find a way to do so by promoting something beneficial with kids. Millenials are probably one of the most liberally inclined generations, can&#39;t put it all the parents, however if you looked at the programming they watched and what they were taught at schools you&#39;ll see a trend.</p>

<p>It takes time and money to fix things, especially a country. The US wasn&#39;t subverted or turned into its current state in a year. It took decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m not trying to dissuade you from being generous, there is no scenario where you will avoid paying taxes.</p>

<p>Charitable contributions are limited to 50% of your income.</p>

<p>When you claim your prize, the states are obligated by the IRS to withhold 25% for taxes. You are responsible for paying and additional required taxes, or for claiming any refunds. But since you can only claim 50% of your income as charitable contributions, you will end up paying at least 25% of your winnings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like they thought about this already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it depends on the jackpot, how much the lump-sum cash prize is, how much taxes removed and where I am in the country. Then, obviously, I&#39;d have to take care of my own (family...etc) first and ensure that I can build up a decently built homestead away from the cities with adequate supplies.</p>

<p>Finally, it all depends on what you think can fix the country. Do I support or fund a candidate who&#39;d align with what I&#39;d believe to be proper goals or do I start up some sort of tech company that&#39;d rival currently popular services? I&#39;d need to find a way to make the money work for me first off, too.</p>

<p>I could always borrow a leaf from the book of the Soviets and start a series of children&#39;s shows in order to control the future VIA the leaders of tomorrow, or... endless possibilities. It all depends on what slice of the pie you want and what you can do to knockout the others who want it too.</p>
