    <div class="md"><p>2008 was the first time he ran in the primaries for President.  Early in the process, Ron Paul quickly became the real frontrunner among the Republican base, and by a wide margin.  He raised more money than any other Republican candidate, and virtually all of that coming from small time donations for &quot;regular people&quot; and hardly any money from big corporations and donors.  Another metric of how Paul was the leader was that you saw Ron Paul bumper stickers and yard signs <em>everywhere</em>. I saw this for myself at the time in Eastern North Carolina, and I had to drive around a lot for my job.</p>

<p>Another metric was online polling and straw polls, which Ron Paul was winning over the other Republican candidates by a <em>wide</em> margin.</p>

<p>Then came the actual primaries, beginning in Iowas.  They were <em>totally rigged</em> -- similar to what was done to Bernie Sanders vs Hillary, but even worse.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember the specific numbers, but Ron Paul was leading the rest of the Republican field (in reality) with about 30% support, and the rest of the pack was something like 15%, 10%, etc.  They rigged the Iowa and subsequent primaries, to make Paul finish something like 3rd in Iowa, and then lower and lower at the subsequent primaries until he faded away.  </p>

<p>The Establishment media took the approach of hardly giving any airtime or attention to Ron Paul early in the process, even though he had raised by far the most money and was the real leader according to straw polls, etc.  And another give-away was that prominent &quot;conservative&quot; pundits engaged in a smear campaign against Paul, notably including Glenn Beck who attacked Paul and his supporters very hard, especially over Paul and his supporters&#39; questioning of the official 9/11 story and the fact that the &quot;war on terror&quot; was a fraud.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall any American soldiers who killed Germans soldiers during WW2, who were American citizens, being imprisoned for doing so. American citizens fighting against the US in war can be killed just like an other opposing soldier and that&#39;s essentially what Obama did. You&#39;re not required to capture an opposing soldier just because he has US citizenship. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>What? Ron Paul was openly socially conservative.</p>

<p>The only &quot;liberal&quot; issues I can think of being associated with Ron Paul are being anti-war (dae anti-interventionalist?) and pro-marijuana.</p>

<p>Ron Paul&#39;s most interesting legislative effort was the We the People Act: <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/We_the_People_Act">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/We_the_People_Act</a></p>

<p>It was designed to allow state governments to pass unconstitutional laws (e.g. banning homosexuality, barring atheists from holding office, requiring Bible study in schools). The bill would do this by barring the SCOTUS from ruling on the constitutionality of state laws in areas to do with sexuality, race, religion, discrimination etc.</p>

<p>It was literally designed to allow, say, Texas to ban sodomy and for the SCOTUS to be unable to overturn the ban.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is a traditional American conservative - fiscally conservative, socially extremely conservative to the point of bigotry against gays/atheists and every other minority group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>States&#39; rights end where the federal Constitution begins. The Constitutional role of the SCOTUS is to rule on the legality of any laws (whether state or federal government).</p>

<p>Did you read the text of the We the People Act? I did when it was first proposed in 2004, re-submitted in 2011, and again today. He&#39;s the official summary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We the People Act - Prohibits the Supreme Court and each Federal court from adjudicating any claim or relying on judicial decisions involving: <strong>(1) State or local laws, regulations, or policies concerning the free exercise or establishment of religion; (2) the right of privacy, including issues of sexual practices, orientation, or reproduction; or (3) the right to marry without regard to sex or sexual orientation where based upon equal protection of the laws.</strong></p>

<p>Allows the Supreme Court and the Federal courts to determine the constitutionality of Federal statutes, administrative rules, or procedures in considering cases arising under the Constitution. Prohibits the Supreme Court and the Federal courts from issuing any ruling that appropriates or expends money, imposes taxes, or otherwise interferes with the legislative functions or administrative discretion of the States.</p>

<p>Authorizes any party or intervener in matters before any Federal court, including the Supreme Court, to challenge the jurisdiction of the court under this Act.</p>

<p>Provides that the violation of this Act by any justice or judge is an impeachable offense and a material breach of good behavior subject to removal.</p>

<p><strong>Negates as binding precedent on the State courts any Federal court decision that relates to an issue removed from Federal jurisdiction by this Act.</strong></p>

<p>Ron Paul wrote this bill; he explicitly designed it to allow states to pass laws banning abortion, banning gay marriage, banning sodomy, mandating Christian prayer in schools and other conservative obsessions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amusing how far some conservatives go to defend unconstitutional laws when the goal of those unconstitutional laws is to establish Christian Sharia in the US...</p>

<p>This may come as a shock to you, but federal law trumps state law, and the federal constitution trumps all state constitutions.</p>

<p>If a state passes an unconstitutional law (e.g. banning gay marriage, banning interracial marriage) it&#39;s the job of the SCOTUS to overturn the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I agree that the base being burnt on the Republican party def pushed them to get the candidate they wanted in the future.  In addition, the reason the base was able to take control was that after Bush2 got out, the neocons had enriched themselves to the point that they would never win another election for another two cycles, so they just walked away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul is a complete wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing and libertarianism has been distorted like every other political -ism to strengthen the corporate state.  There are no such things as free markets, the invisible hand, or companies that will magically self-regulate.  He does what every other politician in history has done: placates his base with sound bites and platitudes.  Take a look at his <a href="https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/296/ron-paul">voting record</a> and you&#39;ll see certain themes emerging - specifically he appeals to Republicans that may be antiwar while simultaneously shilling for big businesses and large industrial polluters.  He&#39;s also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/peter-thiel-ron-pauls-billionaire-sugar-daddy/331514/">owned by billionaire Peter Thiel</a>.  Total fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did to him what they did to Bernie Sanders. The difference was that because he was a Republican, no democrat I ever spoke to even entertained the idea of checking out his policies. If you brought up his name, people would shut you down as soon as they heard the word  &quot;Republican.&quot;</p>

<p>Because of this, they were able to completely marginalize him. This is why I EXTREMELY dislike normies. Because when someone like Paul or Sanders comes along, they don&#39;t have the balls to support them. But they do have the balls to very quickly rationalize why they are voting for the &quot;winning&quot; mainstream candidate.</p>

<p>If you try to educate them, their response is usually something like:</p>

<p>But they all do it!
But it&#39;s always been this way!
But that&#39;s who&#39;s winning!
But that&#39;s who I think best represents my views (even though I&#39;ve just listed 100 reasons why that candidate DOESN&#39;T represent your views)</p>

<p>But try to talk about serious political issues when it&#39;s not an election year or big story &amp; those normies quickly shut you down. Until this changes, we are all fucked until we die. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>What people don&#39;t understand is that the media rarely investigates fringe politicians like Sanders and Paul with anywhere near the same level of resources as they do major/successful politicians like Romney and Hillary.</p>

<p>Once someone like Bernie or Ron Paul looks like he&#39;s building support, the media shine a spotlight on their past actions and words.</p>

<p>Same thing happened in the UK when a relatively obscure politician became head of UKIP, a far-right party. They quickly discovered he&#39;d forged his CV, lied about having a PhD, lied about playing for a famous sports team, lied about being present during a major sports disaster where many people died, and generally lied about everything.</p>

<p>He was eviscerated by the British press and went on to lead UKIP to a disastrous electoral result.</p>

<p>There is no conspiracy here. Minor candidates struggling when suddenly put under major media scrutiny has been a thing since the advent of the political press.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to a Ron Paul rally at UCLA. They had to change venues twice because the crowds were huge. Ultimately there were over 25,000 people inside and a bunch listening outside. Everyone I knew registered Republican, simply to vote for him. I carried 15%, while Romney had like 78%. I never met 1 person from that district that even considered voting for him. The media made him seem fringe, but he wasn&#39;t. I think that&#39;s why Rand was leaning more Republican when first coming into office so the media would portray him as less crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I can remember one of the reasons why Ron Paul didn&#39;t gain much traction is that he had a lot of unwarranted support from the skinhead/neo nazi base based on his views about illegal immigration and securing our borders. This was spinned into Ron Paul has racist ideologies and that was pretty much it. </p>

<p>For the record I don&#39;t condone white supremacy and I am not suggesting in anyway that Ron Paul does but I do remember this being an issue for him during the campaign. I personally felt as well he got the Sanders treatment early on in the race with not a lot of media coverage. I&#39;m an adamant supporter of his son Rand but feel Ron really could have made a positive impact on our country as a whole. It&#39;s a shame how we live in a society where we are under the impression a vote can change the outcome of an election but we all are herded into the decision of two (mostly shitty) candidates whom TBTB selected through suppressive journalism and fear mongering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is 100% correct.  And the Establishment media had to respond to why they were doing this because before the primaries (as I said in my post above), Paul was the clear leader (in reality), based on amount of money raised and the fact that he was winning all the straw polls.  The Establishment media attempted to justify their giving Paul almost no attention by saying something to the effect of &quot;Oh, Ron Paul is a fringe candidate.  The Establishment bosses of the party will never choose him&quot;.  As if the 1% elites get to decide the nominee, and not the conservative grassroots base of the party who make up 99%+ of the party.</p>
