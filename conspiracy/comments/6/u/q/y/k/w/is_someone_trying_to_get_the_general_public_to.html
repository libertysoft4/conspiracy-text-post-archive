But a quick scan of headlines tells me there was a pro-Free Speech rally in Boston, held by 20 or so of the bad guys du jour (nazi&#39;s, alt right, pro-southern pride, and what have you), and they were surrounded by 5,000 people with anti-racism and anti-hate signs? And when the Antifa contingent marched in the crowd applauded them? God these people are so fucking dumb! The messsages are scrambled, their brains and sensibilities are all scrambled. Just stay the fuck home. Or everyone have their own fucking rallies. And I will be fucked if I am ever stupid enough to cheer for fucking Antifa</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?!?!  Holy shit! You&#39;re right dude. I was underestimating.  Bigtime.  Thanks dude.  And I didnt even know Duke was active in politics still.  I think last time I googled him 5 years or so ago he had a web-radio show, maybe?  At that time I concluded (on my own with no further research or data) that he is fed enough money by Dems and Dem related groups to keep his lights on and food on the table, so they can march him out every election cycle and be like: &quot;Hey everyone! This dude was totally the super grand wizard of the KKK and he&#39;s totally voting for (insert Repub name here)!&quot;</p>

Neo-nazis and white supremacists just love to hide behind free speech to espouse their horrible views and then act outraged when they&#39;re fired for their horrible fucking views.

    <div class="md"><p>Its absolutely amazing you don&#39;t see the hypocrisy between your statements.  When an idea you dont like is at issue, you state that its Google&#39;s right to do what they want as a private company.  When an idea you dont like is at issue, you have no problem suppressing their rights as a private company with the point of a gun (government).</p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole problem with &quot;protected classes&quot;.  Equality under the law for all people should be the goal.  Once you start passing laws for different, arbitrarily created groups you ensure that equality under the law is impossible.  We had (and have) an equality and an institutional discrimination problem in this country.  The answer to that problem isn&#39;t to codify our perceived differences into law, its a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an issue with the first amendment of the United States, as that only applies to the government itself.</p>

<p>It is an issue of free speech as a principal, which is something that Americans once believed in and which the first amendment was designed to protect.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying the first amendment was designed to protect the American people or the principle of free speech? Just trying to clarify.</p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the idea of a time when all Americans loved free speech, the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed way back in 1798. During the civil war an anti-war Democrat was arrested and prosecuted for disloyal speech. Another sedition act was passed during WWI. First amendment rights have been abridged multiple times in our past.</p>

<p>However if the government provided all domain registrations, then it would be a very different story. But then the government is controlling access to the internet so thats fucked. </p>

<p>But why do people get so hung up on defending other peoples rights to be complete fucking pieces of shit? Have you read any of the shit on thedailystormer? Whether you are liberal or conservative, it doesnt matter, they push pure hate.

<p>So why should they have that right? What are they to providing society that society must provide them freedom?</p>

<p>Yelling anything fascist is yelling a terroristic threat. It is a threat to the scapegoats of your particular sect. It&#39;s a hate crime</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a false equivalence, most depictions of the president getting murdered are likely satirical. Fascism is all serious, the satire in no way resembles it. They all mean it, the threats are credible.</p>

Since when they decide to show up on the same day, and bring weapons it kind of inherently fucks with free speech for obvious reasons. It&#39;s ok though.

<p>No one would even care who they were if no one showed up to protest them. They&#39;d just be a bunch of dumb rednecks in a park that no one wants to talk to.

<p>I see you attempting to &quot;pull&quot; wool over eyes concerning the conflating @ that rally.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzQIfLQcIP4">This video</a> shows a mob of Boston counter protesters &quot;conflating&quot; free speech with violence, as they lay rough hands on a free citizen speaker &amp; escalate to point one of the mob <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MbYZG0h.png">grabs him by the neck</a> &amp; tries to &quot;pull&quot; his free speech away seemingly wanting it in a body bag, likely because they fear discussing racial issues in a peaceful rational manner absent of a stomp it down tone.</p>

<p>They called him a many unproven things in including nazi, but I do not see any nazi garb or hear him say he was a nazi or make any indication he was. Even if he is a nazi, on video did nothing to be violently violated as he was. After being attacked by the non free speech tolerating lord of the flies mob then the pigpawns man handle treat him as if he broke a law. The non <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly">&quot;peaceable assembled&quot;</a> mob is not allowing free speech using aggression &amp; violent tactics to shut free speech down.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By definition @ root the word &quot;believe&quot; implies <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=believe">&quot;faith or confidence&quot;</a>. I require evidence. I am not a man of faith &amp; do not fall for any follow hollow claims BS. I do not fall into trap holes for confidence games nor do I have confidence in claims I have proven are not factual. </p>

<p>I have shown many examples of non peaceful action @ the event. When a hostile angry mob seeded with violent actors such as antifa screams or attacks to drown out a single or small group to prevent them from speaking it is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly">&quot;peaceable assembly&quot; provide by law</a> &amp; in reality is stomping down others ability to practice free speech.</p>

<p>If nazi, KKK or other hate groups such as the new black panther party etc. speak then IMO few to no cameras &amp; counter crowd is a wiser tactic that gives them little to no energy while giving them free speech without a spotlight that can make them less dim. Allowing them to speak also provides room for them to put their own foot in their mouth or to make non legal threats that cross a  line of what is legal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Boston Police Commissioner says the same thing</p>

<p>&quot;Ninety-nine point nine percent of the people here were here for the <strong>right</strong> reason, and that&#39;s to <strong>fight</strong> bigotry and hate for the most part here today,&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That event was @ times an unruly counter protester mob trying to stop free speech they do not like. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTdAhUYmWxU">Urine was in a non peaceful manner thrown @ the police according to the commissioner</a> as well, but your link leaves that out.</p>

<p>I find <strong>right</strong> &amp; wrong to be words of divide &amp; conquer. One individuals right is another individuals wrong [&amp; vice versa]. IMO a mentality of <strong>fight</strong> applied to any expression of legal speech is a fear based violent mindset TPTB want. If individuals expression of speech crosses a legal line then laws &amp; not a fight applies in a civilized manner. I think haters such as black &amp; white separatist types should be provided with areas to speak. It is legal to hate others. I also think areas of self rule would be the wisest path to explore to give separatist what they want to shut them up in a peaceable manner on their own terms.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering why after all these years this is such a heated view point right now? Serious question. Not trolling.</p>

<p>My experience is that right now and over the last few years people want to and need to be offended about something. If it&#39;s not one thing it&#39;s another. I see this on the macro level on twitter/social media/news and at a micro level in personal interactions. The micro level isn&#39;t even political/social usually, it could be a simple comment about someone&#39;s glasses or sports ability and them getting all offended about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we&#39;re in a time in our country where there&#39;s a large push from &quot;alt-righters&quot; and there&#39;s a very large vocal minority of the right side of the political spectrum which is openly racist. They are getting louder, whether that&#39;s because technology allows them to be louder or their numbers are growing is up for debate. I&#39;d guess both since being louder also allows them to recruit.</p>

<p>This is going to gain a backlash from the portion of the population that hates and detests racist assholes. Change takes time, I think a lot of people are upset with the current politics. But things escalate, sometimes there&#39;s a catalyst. I might guess that the rise of the alt-right and Trump has a lot to do with people wanting to push back against racists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there&#39;s a small portion of racists on the right, but tbh there are many racist people all over. To varying degrees and of all colors, but they&#39;re there. I&#39;ve seen it first hand being a POC and with family and friends of various ethnicity. The big difference is the megaphone of the media. Wherever that is pointed is what gets the most attention. For instance, if they pointed it at Chicago for a week strong, that would be a huge issue (which it is and should be), but it&#39;s barely mentioned.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that the media and a small but very VERY vocal group on the left is trying to group many on the right under one umbrella in order to vilify them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that&#39;s fair. I don&#39;t agree with that because I&#39;m seeing it in the media and on social media. Racists support Trump therefore Trump is racist and if you support Trump then you must be racist as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? I don&#39;t appreciate when you put words in my mouth like that, where did I imply that the immigrants themselves were evil or negative? Where did I say immigrants were only coming into the west? I said we are taking in an extraordinary amount, more so than any part of the world. This isn&#39;t a necessarily surprising fact, the western world is the best place to live so naturally we&#39;d have more immigrants than any other part, but the inflow is becoming far too much for many nations to handle, and its getting to a point where parts of Europe are no longer majority European. Why do western nations have to be these hotbeds of diversity? Why is it only western nations where leftists want everyone to be the same race, for us all to mix and abandon our cultural traditions and heritage? </p>

<p>Pretty much the tone of your entire post. But your whole post, and this follow up, is pretty rambling and honestly rather crazy. So I&#39;ll just say I hope you have a good day and hope someday you can learn not to fear immigrants.</p>

<p>What&#39;s not coming across to you? Are you just too indoctrinated to understand? Do you not see the issue with the current zeitgeist steering us towards a one-race, one-state, one-culture society? </p>

<p>Also, cut it with that typical lefty drivel. I don&#39;t &quot;fear&quot; immigrants. I have not said any negative comment towards immigrants anywhere in my posts, in fact if you look at my prior comments, I even support immigration, the issue I have with our current system of immigration I&#39;ve said above. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tribalism and the act of having to represent a side in some sort of fake battle (this Antifa and Nazi stuff doesn&#39;t leak into modern day relationships with our neighbors and so on). I should be able to share my opinion on the protests without being equated to a Nazi because I&#39;ve seen too many videos of Antifa attacking people and throwing rocks and such.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t have to denounce groups to speak an opinion, and I shouldn&#39;t be generalized into a group for not representing yours.</p>

<p>You see what I&#39;m saying? This only creates derision, we are adults and we can have a meaningful conversation over controversial topics online without all that, and we have for years.</p>

<p>Now they want us to literally ignore eachother as soon as we hear that we are on opposite ends of the aisle politically. These guys aren&#39;t trying to defend Nazis, they are trying to say be wary in the overreach with groups like Antifa, who have burned free speech signs and have bullied others into silence before.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying, I can say Antifa is overreaching and violent, but that doesn&#39;t mean I support literal Nazis. I don&#39;t support Nazis, and honestly I really don&#39;t care about Confederate monuments, that should be a state decision anyway.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying this whole political situation has robbed from us the ability to connect with the other political groups, and we are too busy seeing eachother as a political enemy, instead of dealing with this white supremacist situation responsibly without creating hysteria.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen more upsets and issues arise from the left/right paradigm over the election than I&#39;ve seen issues of racism divide families and friends personally, but maybe I just don&#39;t see it as much. I should though, I&#39;m right in the hot bed of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because left and right is separate from Antifa/Nazi in my opinion, the fact that they are generalized together is where I get frustrated. </p>

<p>Antifa is not moderate left and Nazis aren&#39;t moderate right. We shouldn&#39;t have to answer for the petulant children on both sides, but that&#39;s all everyone wants us to answer for.</p>

<p>Honestly, it took me all of three days to figure out how they were picking and choosing these rally spots. If we spent more time focusing on the actual power players in those groups we could easily expose them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not apart of a movement by the way, I&#39;m just a guy with immense amount of southern guilt and empathy who wants the world to know he doesn&#39;t support Nazis, I just have to end it on &quot;I don&#39;t support Nazis&quot; since no one is interested in solving systemic racism through community policing, police reforms, and reforms on corporate control on issues such as jury selection and so on 🤷</p>

<p>It&#39;s just frustrating that it&#39;s all generalizing online at this point and it forces us to fight instead of finding solutions, at least that&#39;s how it feels to me. Especially with all these groups fighting for the front page.</p>

<p>I&#39;d honestly say neither, Nazis like the ones putting on the rallies will look more like people from my neck of the woods. My big issue is that I&#39;m in Arkansas and I should be surrounded by Nazis. Racists are here, but they are everywhere. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say right now a large majority is leaning towards Antifa, based on the memes and rhetoric of my social media friends. Everyone has made it this issue of &quot;you&#39;re either against Nazis, or a Nazi&quot; leaving no room for debate.</p>

<p>Which I get their point, but doesn&#39;t make it an appropriate debate tactic to silence your opposition. Most people want their oppositions words out in the open, because it&#39;s easier to dispute. Nazis are by far the easiest people to dispute, it&#39;s literally a joke if you&#39;ve seen their numbers online and especially at Boston today.</p>

<p>Self defense, or an attack on free speech. Depends on what provoked the attacks. If they are offensive attacks then they are just as much in the wrong (ie. attack freedom of speech/protest).</p>

<p>The world will change by the open and free discussion of people, not by beating people because you disagree. Have a rational conversation, not an emotional outbreak of violence. The former is the civilized adult way of doing things, the latter is the barbaric childlike way.</p>

<p>If you disagree with someone, open a dialog with them. Explain in a rational matter why they are wrong. Violence is the absolute last thing to do when all other options have failed. It appears certain groups have skipped rational discussion and jumped straight to extremism and violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you can justify attacking someone for any reason when it comes to them acting out on their rights. Now on the other hand self defense and defense of others from physical harm is always reasonable and in many situations is your responsibility.

Even though I don&#39;t agree with their ideas I don&#39;t go protest them because they are exercising their First Amendment rights and I support that. Interfering with the exercising of rights is wrong in my opinion and extremely inflammatory.

    <div class="md"><p>No you are using the threat of calling people politically correct in order to throw people off base and get them to say something stupid so that you can call racism. Actually yes the black does scare me just like when the kkk calls for white whatever scares me. Doesn&#39;t mean that I will back down from my ideas that no race is superior. Also doesn&#39;t mean I will keep either group from acting out their right to free speech. Rights shouldn&#39;t be infringed upon by the government, social groups, or individuals. As for police brutality? I guess that depends on the situation police must be brutal in response to brutality... does that mean I support every shooting or beating by the police? Of course not. Just like you shouldn&#39;t be against police being brutal in every situation. As for victim complex I don&#39;t have one. I generally defend myself when necessary but don&#39;t take the violence, verbal or physical, any further than necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except there are tons of people in the BLM movement that are pushing out white people, jews, and even Asians now. When I say pushing them out I mean not wanting them to march in solidarity with them. Authority in my opinion is a necessary evil but we shouldn&#39;t be comfortable with it. We should chafe at authority to keep it from becoming to all encompassing so we agree with that. They didn&#39;t stop freedom of speech? There were speeches planned that were canceled due to the violence that occurred. The violence only occurred because the other groups came to protest. I wont point fingers and say who threw the first punch cause I wasn&#39;t there. It is a shitty situation and one that I wouldn&#39;t doubt that both sides were looking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was truly a Freedom of Speech rally, I&#39;d see your point and &quot;wake up&quot;. However, it doesn&#39;t take much research to see who actually organizrs this group and their past rallies, like back in May. Kyle Chapman (based stickman), Augustus Invictus, Oathkeeper’s founder Rhodes, Proud Boys MA, and the Leadership Institute (who I consider to be a Lock conservative activist training group) all promote this &quot;free speech&quot; organization and were speakers in May and this in this month&#39;s. A couple dropped out this week, because of their connection to Charlottesville. A lot of the group&#39;s fans wanted to get Richard Spencer to speak.</p>

<p>The KKK publically announced they would be attending this week and instructions provided by groups supporting this rally specifically called out skinheads to dress as normies, to prevent negative media optics.</p>

<p>I can see why people would organize to counter-protest racism. Also the group is self-deceived as pro-Trump, and antifa people counter all pro-Trump stuff (I guess they see him as fascist, I think they like the press).</p>

<p>Ultimately, if Westborough stand on a corner yelling about free speech, I don&#39;t consider counter-protest to be protesting against free speech. </p>

<p>Frankly, I think both sides are manufactured by TPTB to distract us. Wake up!</p>

I like that you used the word &quot;literal&quot;, it&#39;s so telling. Akin to someone repeating the word &quot;indeed&quot; over and over. 
At the other event I saw people holding the flags and wearing uniforms and then something terrible happened. Someone that i couldn&#39;t see, whose motives i couldn&#39;t discern, with tinted out windows and a suspicious number plate decided to ram a crowd of people. I&#39;m glad that such a terrible event did not happen this time.</p>

<p>If you truly find their words the worst that they do then i am sorry for you. I believe in free speech because i believe if an idea is so idiotic or foolish or downright unacceptable then it should be fine and even easy for you to argue and persuade against it.
From as far as i have got into understanding what national socialism means it has nothing to do with car ramming or race hating and just because these people held flags and wore uniforms and even spoke &quot;racial hatred&quot; does not mean they embody it.  Just as those who declare themselves followers of Islam then blow themselves up do not embody the religion more than those who do not. </p>

<p>If you want to scream your head off over a word then i find that somewhat funny. What i find more interesting is how a potential presidential candidate got so close to the presidency and remained in office as secretary of state for so long when so many of the actions of this person could be described as &quot;war engineering&quot;. </p>

<p>But please, with the media trying to convince us that nuclear war is brewing and congress trying to push sanctions on Iran and Russia hoping to create conflict, please tell me that i&#39;m burying my head in the sand by pretending i don&#39;t understand exactly what speech they&#39;re so worried about becoming illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Nazism subscribed to theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race.[2] It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people&#39;s community (Volksgemeinschaft). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum, and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or &quot;inferior&quot; races. The term &quot;National Socialism&quot; arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of &quot;socialism&quot;, as an alternative to both international socialism and free market capitalism. Nazism rejected the Marxist concept of class conflict, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the &quot;common good&quot; and accept political interests as the main priority of economic organization.[3]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the ACLU link he provided:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: The First Amendment prevents the government from arresting people for what they say, but who says the Constitution guarantees speakers a platform on campus?</p>

<p>A: The First Amendment does not require the government to provide a platform to anyone, but it does prohibit the government from discriminating against speech on the basis of the speaker’s viewpoint. For example, public colleges and universities have no obligation to fund student publications; however, the Supreme Court has held that if a public university voluntarily provides these funds, it cannot selectively withhold them from particular student publications simply because they advocate a controversial point of view.</p>

<p>Of course, public colleges and universities are free to invite whomever they like to speak at commencement ceremonies or other events, just as students are free to protest speakers they find offensive. <strong>College administrators cannot, however, dictate which speakers students may invite to campus on their own initiative. If a college or university usually allows students to use campus resources (such as auditoriums) to entertain guests, the school cannot withdraw those resources simply because students have invited a controversial speaker to campus.</strong></p>

Well, considering the government is the entity that writes and enforces free speech laws in the US, I&#39;d say that it has a lot to do with free speech. The government allows individual/group A the freedom to express their opinions without fear of reprisal from the government. It also allows individual/group B the freedom to express their opinions in opposition to the views expressed by individual/group A without fear of reprisal from the government. Group B&#39;s opposition to group A&#39;s opinion isn&#39;t opposition to free speech. It&#39;s opposition to the views expressed by group A. There is a major difference there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but who are you against then? You don&#39;t like antifa because they speak out against nazism/white supremacy, but you support the rights or nazi/white supremacists to speak their minds exposing their beliefs that non whites should have less rights than whites? It appears to me that both groups are allowed to say how the other group sucks and that seems to be free speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more that white supremacist groups are trying to use positive messages like Free Speech and History to defend themselves, when they don&#39;t actually care about those things, and their motives are to start fights with left leaning activist groups and make themselves out to be victims fighting for a just cause. Then the President who needs their votes to maintain his position can come on and defend them, and normalize their position, further dividing the country by distracting people from the issue of the white supremacists coming together to hold rallies, to something banal like defending the first amendment. The first amendment is not under fire, the neo-nazis are, they recognize this and are trying to use terror tactics (&quot;they&#39;re trying to take your freedom of speech away&quot;) to convince people to agree with them, and take their side.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of many dishonest tactics the Nazis use to spread their agenda. Read up on how they infiltrate Internet discussion boards just like this one too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there&#39;s isn&#39;t a push by &quot;someone&quot; to do that. It&#39;s just that a vast amount of people below 25 right now were raised by imbeciles and don&#39;t understand the danger that comes with censoring a group of people because you don&#39;t agree with what they have to say. In their mind, Nazi ideology is evil and society as a whole can agree on that, so it makes it OK to shut down free speech for these people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even a lack of logic or reasoning in the sense that they&#39;re aware that they&#39;re trying to shut down free speech for a particular group, but they just don&#39;t care and don&#39;t believe that everyone should have the ability to say whatever they want. They don&#39;t understand that it&#39;s hell of a slippery slope.</p>

<p>They&#39;re the same people who believe in safe spaces and value political correctness and inclusivity above all else. They&#39;re the people who are filmed shouting at the top of their lungs at university professors because they think the university campus should be a home to them and that, as such, they should be protected from any ideas that make them uncomfortable, or seen screaming and wailing like autists at the news of Trump&#39;s election.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m heavily left-leaning, but the political party that represents that in the US is rotten to the core and the kids that now associate with it are retarded and apparently completely unable of critical thinking.</p>
