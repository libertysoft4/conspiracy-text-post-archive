    <div class="md"><p>You have built in sensors, which are extremely sensitive and accurate: your body knows when it is tilting, moving, right-side up or upside down, or staying still. You can go outside and look up at the sky and see that you and everything around you are stationary. You know that you are not moving 2 million miles per hour because you have no real reason to believe it. You only doubt your own senses because you are instructed to. &quot;Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?&quot; they say. </p>

<p>2 million miles per hour and yet the night sky never changes, with stars in such predictable pattern that people have played the same connect-the-dots game for thousands of years, with most of the drawings still used today because the stars have <em>never moved.</em> But we do, 2 million miles per hour. When common sense comes up, such as human sensations of movement and clear lack thereof, the perpetrators of this heliocentric model must move the stars impossibly far and impossibly large to make up for the fact that there is no observable parallax. Even though we must <em>always</em> tilt toward Polaris in our orbit around the Sun, the arc of the Sun through the sky does not change from low in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere in one month and high in the sky 6 months later as you should see once the Earth is around to the other side of the sky. </p>

<p>How is their theory crazy? There is nothing sane about it. </p>

<p>You know what you have been told is not sane. Study the history of astronomy. The size of celestial bodies and their distances were much smaller until saner minds started asking questions. They were increased in size and distance to &quot;correct&quot; the obvious problems. </p>

<p>Btw there is nothing special about Polaris, other than it being the current North Star. The stars could still have shifted over a flat Earth. Their relative unchanging positions suggest that Earth is not moving 2 million miles per hour.

<p>You made the claim that &quot;stars never move&quot; which I debunked. And it makes sense to me that objects light years away wouldn&#39;t move very much in the short time that humans have been able to record them. </p>

<p>It does but the distances involved are so large it doesnt appear like much. It would be like hiking 2 miles to a mountain in the distance, taking a step forward and proclaiming you arent moving because the mountain appears the same. </p>

<p>Also look up Bernards star for an example of noticeable change over the course of a few years. </p>

<p>I do not have time to debunk all the points you enumerated,  but can assure you they all have been solidly debunked, many many many times over. </p>

<p>I looked, there&#39;s nothing disproving GPS other than some easily-disproveable claims that it&#39;s land based (which makes no sense at all -- it would be easy to detect that the GPS positioning message was never changing).</p>

<p>How did you come to believe we are on a flat earth? How do you think gravity works? Do you think that every satellite since Sputnik was a lie?</p>

<p>Have you ever looked for the international space station? There&#39;s an app to tell you when it&#39;s overhead. You can see it with the naked eye, and it follows <em>exactly</em> the trajectory predicted by orbital physics. </p>

<p>If the Earth isn&#39;t curved, why do pilots fly in great circles? Wouldn&#39;t every pilot have to be in on the conspiracy? </p>

<p>How do you explain the moon&#39;s phases?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to attack you. I am legitimately curious how you explain all of these things, because a round Earth is the most obvious and simple way to explain all of these things, plus it fits with our understanding of gravity as a whole (which has been proven, since we can predict the positions of planets). And it doesn&#39;t require a massive conspiracy of literally every major government in the world, and every U-2 pilot, and astronaut, and GPS engineer. I honestly just don&#39;t understand how someone believes these things.</p>

<p>Watch &quot;The Morgile&quot; and &quot;Jeranism&quot; clips.  They answer all your points,  and then some. I recommend you look into some of their earlier clips,  too. </p>

<p>For starters, gravity is a theory and is not proven.  No one knows what gravity is. We can measure it and that is about it. Newton,  sure,  was a genius,  in the same sense Shakespeare is a genius. His equations merely describes gravity,  what cause the force or even where it comes from,  no one knows. </p>

<p>The earth being a spinning ball is <em>not</em> intuituve,   you just believe it because someone has said so.  As a matter of fact, you have to do a LOT of mental gymnastics to imagine <a href="https://youtu.be/0jHsq36_NTU">we are moving like this</a> through space.  </p>

<p>There are many pilots,  engineers and even NASA personnel that have come out as saying earth is not a spinning ball.   </p>

<p>You observe and draw conclusions, not an issue there we all do. The problem is you dont go deeper. </p>

<p>You said yourself you work with software. What if I told you computers are magic because I have never seen an electron move through a logic gate on a CPU. </p>

<p>There is no way for me to independently verify this phenomena. </p>

Blueberry (with real blueberries) is the best of all.  I also like when their is a sourdough taste to the pancakes.  Want to hear about making a culture so you can have sourdough of your own?

<p>I do not have time to debunk all the points you enumerated,  but can assure you they all have been solidly debunked, many many many times over. </p>

<p>For pure entertainment, go on YouTube and watch all the &quot;Flat earth asshole vs...&quot; that you can find. </p>

<p>Jeranism,  and The Morgue are not as funny,  maybe more technical.  </p>

<p>Those 3 are my preferred sources. They are honest and very smart dudes that are not afraid of debating anyone on this topic.  Look at their subscriber numbers,  they have gained  lots of traction over the past few years. </p>
