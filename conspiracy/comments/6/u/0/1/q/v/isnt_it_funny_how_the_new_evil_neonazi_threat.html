    <div class="md"><p>And its a damn good narrative. I makes it very easy to turn the public against any united groups of politically active citizens. All you have to do now is say &quot;they are Neo-Nazi&#39;s&quot; if they lean right and &quot;they are Antifa&quot; if they lean left.</p>

<p>The public is frothing at the mouth at both ends of the political spectrum. And the media is guiding them like a horse and carrot.</p>

<p>&quot;Pushed&quot; implying this is some kind of battle against the evidence, when you&#39;re the only one pushing CIA talking points. </p>

<p>I noticed you didn&#39;t respond to my evidence from veteran intelligence officials. Do you not &quot;do evidence&quot; like John Brennan? (i.e. you make things up without any foundation in reality)</p>

<p>Yes, the idea that Russia remotely hacked the DNC is demolished by the proof that the leak came from the inside. It&#39;s over, everyone knows, and the narrative has been abandoned.</p>

<p>The Russia narrative is a joke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, the &quot;narrative&quot; is a joke.  The investigation is not.  Why are you trying to deny it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the headline earlier, but didn&#39;t get a chance to read it. This is a bigger bombshell than I thought. Earlier emails before the meeting between manafort, donnie junior, kushner, and the russians. George Papadopoulos emailed the trump campaign multiple times about meeting with Putin. One of Trump&#39;s advisors admiral kubic expressed concern about violating sanctions and Logan act in a march 2016 email. Paul manafort was also hesitant in a may 2016 email. But the meeting with manafort, donnie jr, kushner, and the russians was in June 2016.</p>

<p>Sam Clovis, the campaign cochairman said  &quot;There are legal issues we need to mitigate, meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen,&quot; </p>

<p>This basically screws manafort. He acknowledged meetings with the russians would be illegal and did it anyways with donnie jr and kush. No wonder the FBI raided his house. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you please explain to me how it carries the same weight? I don&#39;t think it would under the Logan Act:</p>

<p><em>Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. This section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply himself, or his agent, to any foreign government, or the agents thereof, for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects.</em></p>

<p>Now apparently Natalia may have had previous ties to the KGB, as some investigators are claiming. And may possibly still be working for the Kremlin at some level. If true, I highly doubt Trump Jr. knew about this, considering there&#39;s no evidence (yet?) that he knew who she was and the meeting was setup with an intermediary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re relying on the ignorance of the readers here. There&#39;s a difference between seeing a DNC operative (who happens to be of Russian heritage) and &quot;The Russians,&quot; meaning: Putin.</p>

<p>Don, Jr. never met with &quot;The Russians&quot;.</p>

<p>He met with a woman of Russian heritage (who happened, as we discovered, to be sent in by the DNC to implicate Trump with the very narrative you&#39;re trying to pimp).</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, hey met with Paul McCartney! Oh, my God you mean he met with &#39;British Intelligence&#39; and James Bond?&quot;</p>

<p>No, Pau McCartney is NOT British Intelligence (just because he happens to be a citizen of the UK) anymore than the woman Don, Jr. met with was &quot;The Russians&quot;.</p>

<p>In the fake bombshell documents you want to confuse people with, some low-eval guy asked Trump&#39;s people if they wanted to meet with Putin&#39;s people, whereupon all the high-live people said NO.</p>

<p>Narrative: debunked.</p>

<p>The very email chain you&#39;re citing destroys your own case.</p>

<p>Yet your sad response is &quot;Er . . . uh . . . but . . . um . . . Don Jr. once met with comedian Yakov Smirnov in 1997. Hence he was talking to &#39;The Russians&#39;!&quot;</p>
