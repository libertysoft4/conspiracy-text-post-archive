    <div class="md"><p>Last time this happened I asked some simple question about whether these ships had collision avoidance systems. I got no less than 10 replies all insinuating the question was ridiculous in some go nowhere thread. After the first guy I was like &quot;ok, must have been a dumb question&quot;. By the 5th guy I was suspicious. But a day later I was <em>still</em> getting responses of the same kind.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been around awhile. Never seen shit like that. Something is fishy af about these collisions. Inc gaslight lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Member the cruise missiles launched at Syria? Alot of those never hit their target. Never was explained.</p>

<p>Too many incidents in 8 months. Way too many. I think they&#39;re covering something up.</p>

<p>Either it&#39;s on-board sabotage (the USS McCain supposedly lost steering temporarily right before collision) their system might be getting hacked on board.</p>

<p>Or someone has some new technology that is capable of nullifying signal return in radar pulses. I&#39;m going with this one..personally.</p>

<p>My reasoning...why was the need for a  Space Command just announced? Seems relevant.</p>

<p>Or </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cant claim i know but imho.. they are trying to hit us. With bounties paid. In some straits/lanes it can be bad when protocol isnt followed. I think our radar is being jammed and then we get hit. I do know people in the Navy were kicked out past time though. Not waking the commander of the ship is unforgiveable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. All ships Navy ships have personnel on watch with binoculars. This os systemic negligence. Probably due to ships being assigned shitty liberal college culture captains, by obama general appointees. They cant run a tight ship where sailors shit their pants at the sitht of an officer. Imo, every captain assignment made in the last 9 years should re-assessed, and obama appointed command, or anyone down the chain appointed by them should be removed and replaced.</p>

<p>We need boot camp to return to full metal jacket style drill sergeants. Thats what it takes to make 18-22 year olds fulfill their duties 110%.</p>

<p>&quot;hot&quot; war between super powers is absolutely impossible now. Both sides know nuclear annihilation is the only outcome. Both sides know the only way to fight is through a 21st century form of guerilla tactics.</p>

<p>I&#39;d wager that we are actually 100% in the dark about what&#39;s really going on in the world around us. Think about it. The only way we get information is through the fucking media.</p>
