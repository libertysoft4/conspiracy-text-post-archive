        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Honestly, as horrific as this may sound to you future billionaires (dreamers), we need a maximum wage of 25 million NET per year. We also need a simplified tax system so people can&#39;t cheat but pay a fair wage all around. </p>

<p>I mentioned this months back and one person was complaining because they made a lot of money with a gigantic overhead but they were missing the point. Net income is what&#39;s left at the end of the year after all the overhead expenses so if someone makes 1 billion and has 1 billion worth of expenses, then they made $0 net this year and should not pay any taxes. I&#39;m just using this as a simple example. </p>

<p>There is absolutely no reason or any good that can come out of people making over 25 million a year. That&#39;s over 2 million dollars a month and plenty for anyone. </p>

<p>The problem is that these money worshippers are pulling in billions (sometimes trillions in gross revenue) and fucking up the whole economy. There is absolutely no good that comes from making over 25 million a year. Some might say that these people are opening up new locations (ie a new walmart) and that is true but they are also monopolizing the industry they are in instead of letting an up and coming businessman to invest into the market and create his own company that competes with the billionaires somehow (ie a new social network to compete with facebook). </p>

<p>Without an income cap, the thilthy rich who are also in bed with the cabal just keep extracting and extracting from the world economies without end and that is why we keep running into problems that lead to a worst quality of life for all. </p>

<p>Before walmart took over every hot spot across the country, there were many, many ma and pa stores that were doing fairly well but they are mostly shut down now leading to a middle class fallout. </p>

<p>But, the problem is these rich companies have become so powerful that they are controlling the economic rules to benefit themselves. Still, its a good thing to keep in mind so that we can one day make some adjustments to crush this unfair system and stimulate the economy. </p>

<p>(Also, any excess money past 25 million should be utilized into something important like infrastructure or education to further build the country instead of wrecking it now). </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>In all seriousness, MONEY is the problem. It was a good system to help evolve us back in the day, but it has lost its functionality due to nonstop looting. Any system (capitalism, socialism, communism) that uses money is going to end up failing as they always have. </p>

<p>The ONLY solution I know of is to get off our dependency of money. We don&#39;t need it and there is a system that was created called SACRED ECONOMICS that will automatically take us all out of debt and level the playing field so that humanity moves up and down together (and we can move way, way up!). </p>

<p>See 12 minute video explaining Sacred Economics here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: Communism and socialism are gimmicks to enrich the top 1% just like capatalism is but in a unique way. Whenever money is involved, the 1% of those who hold power win. The 1% can move the market at will but they keep it at a barely functioning level for power and control reasons. If we get off the usage of money, we drain them of power. That is why I was recommending sacred economics. It doesn&#39;t use money and seems like the most lucrative option. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding your point at large, I think you are better off fixing &#39;maximum ownership&#39;, and then perhaps democracy in general. But to your point, I fully agree with setting a maximum wage, though I feel it&#39;s ultimately patch fixing.</p>

<p>In the end, governments support and serve the financial, or currency system. Regardless of &#39;feelings&#39;, those with more currency will ALWAYS have more say in government. Regarding a &#39;grown persons abilities&#39;, it is debatable whether or not their amount of growth should be limited, or though it is widely agreed that the base level humans should not fall below X on a standardized basis.</p>

<p>For example, it is speculated that when humans fall below the amount of money necessary to sustain life, that they will become violent and break the governmental contracts, rather than passively die.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the Rub, the same Rub Thomas Paine fought for back in 1776, with the Rights of Man. Should any child be BORN with an extreme ownership of society or currency units? In 1776, this was clearly referring to the King, but literally applies to all children.</p>

<p>Today you have situations where some children are BORN into a situation where they possess extreme societal ownership ON BIRTH. Some are born owning more than 10% of future societal output. Is that fair? What would be your rule and regulation for that?</p>

<p>So what I think is a better system is to set a &#39;maximum societal ownership percentage&#39;, and to make the information publicly available. After all, everyone paying taxes and voting within America is ultimately contributing to the American distribution of funds and ownership. Don&#39;t you think it would be good to know for whom you serve?</p>

<p>I loosely suggest that no single individual in America should possess more than 1 of 1,000% of societal ownership. This could be interpreted as $16 Billion. In terms of redistribution, I would be even initially content if Bill Gates and Buffet were able to redistribute the money as they please, just so long as, at the end of the year, every year, no individual was allowed to possess greater than 1 of 1,000% of societal ownership.</p>

<p>For example, $100,000 in savings represents about 1 in 160,000% of ownership, and I think the average American has about $25,000 in savings.</p>

<p>Fixing the bottom has more to do with education, motivation, and discipline, but fixing those at the top will always require the application of law and morality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening here. I&#39;m glad your dad is doing great but 25 million a year is fanatastic. Who needs more money than that? The problem is that the more they absorb cash from the economy, the worst the economy gets. Cash is supposed to change hands non-stop. It needs to always be spent while some is saved but when people like Facebook are saving tens of billions in a bank that doesn&#39;t benefit anyone except for the billionaire banks, we have a problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there are negatives but Bill Gates seems to be doing good with his money.</p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying and yes, unused to be one of those embarrassed millionaires who was just working my way up. As I&#39;ve aged I don&#39;t care to sacrifice my time with family and friends to run in the wheel. I make good money but I&#39;m content where I&#39;m at.</p>

<p>If we limit income where does the excess go? </p>

<p>Most income earned by top .1% is not W2 income, it&#39;s investment income. Which is taxed 15% flat rate currently (I think) </p>

<p>I&#39;ve come around to the idea of UBI, population is growing and efficiency is increasing. That is not sustainable.  I&#39;d say rather than cap income,  retard wealth growth and hoarding. If a billionaire spent  most of their money every year it&#39;s not a problem. The money is going back into the economy, the problem is it is being pooled and never gets back out. </p>

<p>Other thing we need to be aware of is the very rich are not loyal to the country as much. They can leave if the environment becomes too hostile to them. It&#39;s a delicate balance.   </p>

<p>Well, you might think Google has &quot;earned&quot; making million of dollars per minute, but to me, that is unfair. Great. Google is great but that doesn&#39;t give them the right to harvest all the money out of our economy because it left the rest of us in shambles. </p>

<p>Simply put, we need a limit because without limits we will all suffer in the end. There&#39;s no stopping monster companies without an income cap. They will just keep sucking money out like a vacuum. </p>

<p>First of all, a company is not an individual. First you want to cap the personal worth of individuals, and now you are claiming you want to cap how much businesses can take in. I think we should have anti-monopoly and collusions laws on the books, but that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re arguing for, you&#39;re arguing for wealth limits. </p>

<p>I really can&#39;t express how stupid I think you are without getting banned. Do you want to see all the businesses that made this country into the most economically prosperous nation in the history of humanity disappear? Do you want to become a large scale version of Cuba or Venezuela? What you&#39;re advocating for is exactly how you do it which is why the philosophy used to found this nation is the exact opposite of what you&#39;re espousing in these comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Positive sum games can still have both winners and losers.</p>

<p>Looking at the ultra wealth it is pretty clear to me that they frequently acquire wealth at the expense of others. Just look at the &#39;08 crash. They knew they were selling bogus CDOs but did anyway, thereby accumulating wealth that represented no real value. Then when the crash happened they secured taxpayer bailout money so that they retained their jobs/companies/wealth while old Joe down the street lost his house to a bank.</p>

<p>Underneath all of this there is a healthy economy where people are producing value, so as you say it isn&#39;t a zero sum game. We have a lot of people producing new wealth all around the world. But when the ultra wealthy play games by selling bogus CDOs, manipulating stock prices, etc, they are generally taking wealth from someone else. That is why wealth inequality continues to grow at astounding rates.</p>

Create a maximum wage and the wealthy will just create companies for themselves instead so that their income is not a wage (they already do this for taxes).

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they were. CEOs&#39; job is to make decisions. those decisions will either increase or decrease a company&#39;s value. if their decisions decrease the value, then they will be sacked (unless they are in companies protected by government, as happens rampantly today). but making decisions is necessary in any situation, be it a family or a company. they are not leeching if the shareholders decide they are doing a good job and want to pay them to make those decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes ok i see your point, but if we assume communism in this scenario, the statement, capable people will not work because wages too low is false, because as i said, capable people work and invent because they can.</p>

<p>it&#39;s like a, even in capitalism, saying, i have an idea, very good idea for a product that will make me rich, but the taxes are too high, so I won&#39;t do it. because, you know, 20% is too much or whatever ... but if it was 10% i would make this and be rich.</p>

<p>nobody ever said that, and taxes do not influence the smart, capable people. they do stuff becaue they can and no amount of wages will change that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, funny that you mention it, I started a company and closed it after a year and half because the reward was just not worth it (too much hassle, not enough payoff). went back to work for a multinational.</p>

<p>there are studies about this as well. high taxes and regulations benefit big companies because they have enough money to pay people to go through the hassle, comply with all the regulations and still make profits. small entrepreneurs have a much harder time and some of them (like me) quit after a while cause it&#39;s just not worth it. of course, some people will have a sense of duty to do whatever it is they want to do, but some will simply fall back to a safer and more rewarding 9-6 job, which I did cause I would rather not have the hassle and get more money.</p>

<p>high taxes and regs also promote the black market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is similar to what Mélenchon (French president candidate is proposing), but much more severe: 100% tax on all personal earnings over €400k. </p>

<p>But I think it has a major flaw: the €400-€1mil/year is for very specialized employees, rare scientists or doctors, extreme high risk oil/fire workers, etc. Second, it cuts into the value of stock options, which start-ups need to convince smart people to not work for big rich tech companies. If you cap those income ranges, you might reduce the number of people who do those jobs. </p>

<p>Above €1mil/year, people can easily redirect income overseas and avoid incurring the tax. You may be able to limit it if you can closely track money made and distributed within the country, but that would be the extent. Not to mention, it encourages companies to move their headquarters out of the country, so they can pay their execs what the execs demand.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is all a market force. Taxation can work when the market is inelastic, people have to do the business no matter how high the tax is. But if it&#39;s easy to leave, an elastic market, then they will leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually only found out about this, this year because I actually went in to talk to my tax person on account of some income changes, etc.</p>

<p>&quot;For 2017, the maximum amount of taxable earnings for Social Security and Medicare is $127,500. In other words, an employee must pay 6.2% of any income up to $127,500 for 2017 = $7,905. But any dollar you make above $127,500 is free of the Social Security tax&quot; - See more at: <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/maximum-taxable-income-amount-for-social-security-fica/">http://www.financialsamurai.com/maximum-taxable-income-amount-for-social-security-fica/</a>&quot;</p>

<p>It changes each year and there are other technical things to look at, but yeah after a certain amount that you make, you no longer pay social security or medicare on the rest of your earnings.</p>

<p>Second that. As a progressive, I don&#39;t want to fight another straw man that makes it easier to paint us as if we hate success.</p>

<p>The problem is that the tax system we have now, with all its loopholes is likely not even progressive as a whole, except for the middle class.</p>

<p>Simply eliminating loopholes, and taxing all income as regular income, so that everyone pays taxes on the same progressive scale <em>we already have</em>, and middle class is subject to, would be a huge change.</p>

<p>You can even frame it as lowering the taxes for the middle and lower classes. If you increase tax revenue from taxes collected due to closing of the loopholes, you can lower the taxes for those who did not get the chance to use those loopholes by the equal amount.</p>

<p>Our current (American) system is actually based on the amalgamation of ideas created by western philosophers over thousands of years which were selectively included by the founding fathers in the structure of our government. In those thousands of years the western world, not just the U.S., has flourished and has created the highest levels of quality of life compared to any other region of the world, in the entire history of the world. </p>

<p>Have some gratitude for the profoundness and success of these ideas instead of wanting to rip out the philosophical foundation of the western world because you have a personal problem with the skin color and biological sex of the creators of this foundation. </p>

<p>To make all property publicly owned you have to do something. You can&#39;t just snap your fingers and make it so. You have to implement a structure and force people to abide by it if you want a society to work no matter what, or else you just have anarchy.</p>

<p>The communist movement will come just like all of the other movements before it, changes in material conditions which lead to changes in the relationship to production.  You don&#39;t just say, hey all means of production are socially controlled, just like the capitalism didn&#39;t emerge from feudal society by simple declarations.  The movement is a bottom up movement, not something implemented from the top down(here we are again).  </p>

<p>Yes, our relations with men, production, and society will be much different than it is now.  Our material conditions determine man&#39;s thought, just as the tendencies we all have today, differ from the tendencies of men before us.  This is basic historical materialism, for a better understanding I would recommend chapter 1 of The German Ideology.   The citation needed was the eternal human nature you speak of that cannot exist with communism.</p>

I&#39;d say there is LITTLE doubt that wealth inequality fits the description of harmful.  I don&#39;t know that this solution works at all and I&#39;m more of the mind of helping others than I am hindering people.  It&#39;s a twisted cycle, though and I should know because I&#39;ve been a part of it:  &quot;Go do market research surveys against competitors and don&#39;t come back to me until you come back with something that justifies a raise for the CEO to the board.&quot; (and hopefully when my review comes around I&#39;ll get a nice perk for inflating their wealth further)  <em>proceeds to go to companies that pay their CEOs outrageous pay and prints it out</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually very generous, that leftist in France wants to tax income over 430k 100%. What it comes down to is an ethical battle; is it ethical to &quot;punish&quot; the very successful/&quot;limit&quot; personal liberty vs. Is it ethical to let the very successful dominate the economy and the political scene to their exclusive benefit, socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the 99%. Then you get into private property, assets, stocks, upper distribution of wealth, etc. </p>

<p>Acknowledging reality and the current, pressing needs of the masses to not only survive but have a chance to be self-sufficient in this world should wipe out the &quot;liberty&quot; based concerns (but of course I would say this, I&#39;m a leftist myself. Just as someone on the right would say &quot;this isn&#39;t about ideology it&#39;s about what&#39;s good and real and truly free.&quot;) The back and forth lasts forever-- but clearly, here in America, the system maintains and is only getting worse for the vast majority of workers and citizens.

<p>Start by dismantling the regulations in place which achieve the same effect of protecting the larger players at the expense of newcomers.</p>

<p>You may not appreciate that this is very much how the government operates, but from their perspective, the established outfit (ie the billionaire) is a major employer.</p>

<p>Consider how many hundreds of thousands of people (if not millions) are currently involved in the taxation racket. The government is terrified of simplifying to a flat tax, because it would render almost all of those people unemployed.</p>

<p>We may not be China, but that doesn&#39;t mean our government isn&#39;t as desperate to create jobs even when the market doesn&#39;t support that job creation.</p>

<p>Marxism is not something to be implemented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marx said numerous times there has to be a world-wide communist revolution implemented relatively simultaneously. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Empirically communism is only possible as the act of dominant peoples &#39;all at once&#39; and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In all revolutions up until now the mod off activity always remained unscathed and it was only a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labor to other persons, <strong>while the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity, does away with labour, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves</strong>, because it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society, is not recognized as a class, and is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc within present society.&quot;</p>
