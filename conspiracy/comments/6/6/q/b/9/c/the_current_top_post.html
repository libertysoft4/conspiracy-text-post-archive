    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even using scientific proof at this point because I realize that they feel this way. I&#39;m using general observations that anyone can make, and yet, I get &quot;The southern celestial pole doesn&#39;t exist&quot; and &quot;Sigma Octantis is fake&quot; and &quot;The stars don&#39;t rotate around a pole star in the southern hemisphere&quot;, all things which are not scientifically reliant, but things you can see yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not invested in science being the truth at all, I actually believe in Antarctic Nazi bases as well as a form of Hollow Earth Theory. Shit, I&#39;ve posted spirit science videos here as well as lectures by Manly P. Hall. I get emotionally involved because I see these people as intellectually lost. People willing to question what they&#39;ve been told that for some reason have latched on to this theory for reasons that many of them can&#39;t even explain past &quot;the government has been lying to us, wake up&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you seriously believe there is no proof of a round Earth other than science, then you&#39;re no better</p>

<p>If a Flat Earthers argument to &quot;why do the stars appear to rotate counterclockwise around the northern Celestial pole and clockwise around the southern celestial pole&quot; is &quot;Sigma Octantis doesn&#39;t exist and neither does the southern celestial pole&quot; please forgive me for assuming they&#39;ve done absolutely no research and are unwilling to look into anything that doesn&#39;t fit their flat worldview.</p>

<p>Every single person with working eyes in Australia can see Sigma Octantis and the Southern Celestial Pole. To deny it is idiotic. To claim that they somehow <em>dont</em> behave that way is also idiotic, as it&#39;s based on observation, just as all Flat Earthers try to get us to do. </p>

<p>I believe the Earth is round because I have <em>absolutely no reason</em> to believe it&#39;s flat. Polaris, solar flares, star trails, the tides, eclipses, shadow lengths, there is absolutely <em>tons</em> of evidence to support a round Earth.</p>

<p>Flat Earthers have &quot;well the government usually lies&quot; and &quot;well the Book of Enoch says x&quot; and drawings from ancient religions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you feel about people that don&#39;t question the MSM and follow what they&#39;re fed blindly? It frustrates me to see people do this even though they are presented evidence that the MSM don&#39;t have their best interests in mind, or have been lying to them, just like it frustrates me to see Flat Earthers deny it completely ignore evidence that contradicts flat Earth. It&#39;s like they all woke up one day and said &quot;yup looks flat, everything else that says otherwise is fake or explainable by it being flat&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty ridiculous that this entire sub and the entire conspiracy community outside of reddit is considered a joke because of something as easily disproven as flat Earth theory.</p>

<p>As for why I&#39;m so adamant about it, it&#39;s because it&#39;s willful ignorance. People choosing to be idiots when they could use this dedication or passion elsewhere is a frustrating waste of life in my eyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, sure, but you can witness the MSM lies, spin and propaganda right in front of your face. And the MSM has a strong influence in shaping our perception, which is dangerous.</p>

<p>The earth being round is after all, a theory. Theories should be constantly challenged. That&#39;s how science progresses. So maybe (extremely likely) the flat earth people are wrong, but if it leads others to be interested in researching scientific theories for themselves, or prompts science to do new experiments or research to further prove them wrong, how is that a bad thing? How are someone&#39;s beliefs about the shape of the earthy harmful to society as a whole?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what&#39;s been so insane to me. Pedophilic child abuse has now somehow become a partisan issue. It is effective. Nothing will ever be done about it when you get so many people to believe it&#39;s some right wing political conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>That&#39;s another misunderstanding too. It started as &quot;pizzagate&quot; which led a lot of people down the rabbit hole to documentaries like &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; and actual documentable, proven facts about high profile child trafficking rings all over the world. And all those facts can now be discredited by anyone who brings them up by simply calling them a &quot;Trump supporter.&quot; I&#39;m afraid this world is truly doomed. The brainwashing is far too easy to accomplish now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that. however, I&#39;ve been here for longer than most of the mods. The moderation is a bit heavy these days. I still like some of the content but just find myself veering towards different areas now.  Thats a shame. I should be pushed away from a sub I love because the editorial team decide the rules change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your opinion but I don&#39;t really know what answer you&#39;re looking for.  The rules haven&#39;t changed much at all in the last two or three years and this OP would have been considered a shitpost and removed two years ago just as it was today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what the post was about. I apologise about the rant, was meant to be some banter that went wrong. I just don&#39;t want this sub changing into some heavily moderated &quot;you are free to think what we tell you&quot;. Here and r/c_s_t are where I challenge the norm.  anyway, I digress.  no foul language! ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think the moderation is as heavy-handed as you&#39;re implying.  If you actually check the public mod logs, I think you&#39;d find that most of what we remove are either trolling, low effort, attacks against the sub and it&#39;s users, etc.  If there&#39;s &quot;more&quot; moderation these days, consider that there&#39;s also more garbage being posted these days.</p>
