Seriously, don&#39;t abandon Christianity. Pray patiently and stop relying on your feelings and your incomplete understanding, as though God owes you experiences, or as though you are fit to judge whether God&#39;s behavior is reasonable. Just be patient and wait on God and don&#39;t be an asshole. Nobody else here is going to tell you this, but they will happily tell you the opposite, over and over and over, and make it all look very appetizing to you.

I&#39;m not going to go into the issues with religion/its indoctrination being a regional thing. A question I like to ask American Christians (assuming you&#39;re American; if not--apply to your area) is &quot;had you been born in a largely Muslim area to Muslim parents, do you think you&#39;d be exactly as Christian as you are now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conditioned things have very little sway on me, I don&#39;t celebrate holidays or even consider my own family to be family for example, and I also rejected Christianity as a young child and believed otherwise for the majority of my life. I only came back to it by coincidence, if you can call it coincidence that I discovered Jesus to be factually Christ and was thus persuaded logically. Not everyone who believes in Christ does so for cultural or conditioned reasons. You might think so if you think there is no legitimate basis for a belief in Christ, but you are mistaken to think that.</p>

<p>As far as whether I would be a Christian if I was born in a majority Muslim nation, I think that depends whether I had opportunity to be exposed to it or not. However I can say for certainty that I would not be a Muslim, seeing as Muslim belief can not be substantiated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy. I&#39;ll help you out. It&#39;s a belief. Can a belief be factually proven? No, it can&#39;t. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a belief. That&#39;s why there are a lot of them who all claim they&#39;re the correct one. And the ill-effects of that kind of thinking are divisive. The way you just discounted the Muslim belief system while upholding your own is a great example of the intolerance religion can breed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re all-knowing on the topic of Christianity? That&#39;s ridiculous! Truth has no accurate words to describe it, it&#39;s your interpretation that either fits the picture or doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Whether you believe that it&#39;s Christ, or Buddha, or Ra that leads to fulfillment plays little to no role in the game. It&#39;s the question of whether or not you choose to do good for the whole (which is you manifested in the mulitude) or just yourself (which is the temporary manifestation of your current iteration) is the only choice we ever have.</p>

<p>Christianity, read correctly, can give you a pathway, but so can Buddhism, Islam and Atheism. It&#39;s your choices that matter. Your actions.</p>

My husband is a deist, and while you don&#39;t hear many people these days running around saying they&#39;re &quot;deists&quot;, I think the simple definition applies to a lot more people than many would think.  Something worth looking into anyway.</p>

<p>My thoughts are that nobody knows.  Period.  Not the Pope, not Joel Olsteen, not the Dalai Llama.  So who are they to tell me what to think when they don&#39;t really know themselves?  They believe... but they don&#39;t <em>know</em> any more than I do.  Hence, the problem with religion. </p>

<p>But I have an absolute faith in a higher power and for convenience I call it God.  The rest of my beliefs are a hodgepodge of mixed religions that I&#39;ve pieced together from years and years of reading that work for me personally, which is all that really matters, to make sense of the Universe.</p>

<p>So while I admire you shedding the Christianity label, don&#39;t feel like that means you have to turn away from a belief in something.  Read, explore and feel around many other&#39;s beliefs and find what feels right for you.  Have fun exploring!</p>

<p>And god is supposed to be omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and all-loving, so he kind of is a genie in the sense that he can do literally anything. Why wouldn&#39;t he help starving and disease-ridden children? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, he gives us free will because free will is objectively superior. Think of unintelligent animals for example. They&#39;re alive, yes, but they can&#39;t really know things or choose things or value things, it&#39;s all just instinct and conditioning. They can&#39;t experience the same kinds of profound things that we as people can experience, and in that sense, they&#39;re missing out. God wants us to have these things, because he legit wants us to have as many good things for free as possible. Free will is part of those things.</p>

<p>there is no damnation for using free will, because we&#39;re intended to have it and use it. Damnation is a very specific consequence for using free will in a very specific way, which is the wrong way. When we do this, we cause the consequence ourselves. But otherwise, free will is totally fine.</p>

<p>it&#39;s true that God can literally do anything. However, in many cases, he does not act, because acting would take free will away from us, or otherwise take life away from us. If he magically healed children of their diseases, for example, perhaps it would publicly reveal that God was working on the earth. Now we have a host of new problems. Maybe people don&#39;t have the luxury of denying God any more, and they can&#39;t handle it. Maybe people reject God anyway, and they become more guilty, when otherwise they were excused by their ignorance. Or maybe evil people simply hide themselves and lie to themselves, and that evil only festers and worsens, instead of having a chance to come out and be resolved. Maybe they never have a chance to become repentant and reject their own evil, because they never get a chance to regret their evil. Any number of subtle things could be possible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know for sure why God doesn&#39;t heal diseased children, and there are many other things I also don&#39;t know. But I know that God is definitely not impotent. I know that he is brilliant, and that he is also good. So I can say with confidence that there is definitely an explanation of some kind for whatever he is doing, every single time, regardless of whether I know the explanation or not. And many times he will also allow me to know the explanation to some extent, and that is very awesome.</p>

<p>people who take positions of certainty about what is possible, as though they know impossible things, are actively bullshitting themselves and actively clouding their own perception of God. People who value some types of data highly while completely dodging other data that is freely available, such as those who adopt atheistic and hedonistic worldviews and conclude they are justified in doing so, are also actively bullshitting themselves and actively clouding their own perception of God. Repentance, humility, letting go of your own bullshit, automatically demonstrates the reality of God. I have seen that this is true, and I am a witness. If anyone has not explored these things, I find it silly that he would presume to speak about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am not bullshiting myself. I&#39;m not certain god doesn&#39;t exist, but using simple <strong>logical</strong> ** deduction** leads me to the conclusion that this being most likely doesn&#39;t exist. Logic has a form and a structure, and it is objective. Logical contradictions don&#39;t work. </p>

<p>On a side note, how do we even have free will if this kind of god exists? If he is omniscient, then he knows everything, including the future and all the decisions you&#39;re going to make. So how can you be said to have free will when god already knows what you&#39;ll do? It&#39;s not like you can do something different, god is infallible so you&#39;re actions are already predetermined.  </p>

<p>There is a multitude of philosophical literature concerning god&#39;s existence, and I haven&#39;t even scratched the surface of the logical inconsistencies and contradictions that the Christian god presents. I would definitely recommend looking into them. Many good arguments from both sides of the issue. It&#39;s just that the arguments in support of god&#39;s existence don&#39;t really hold up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He gave us free will bec we are created us in His own  image.  He did not want robots but a real relationship. Man is a very special creation of His bec of this, and probably why Satan hates us so much.  (Spirit cooking) </p>

<p>God does not punish us for using our free will.  There are consequences to making choices when you have free will and God warned us (through Adam &amp; Eve) that making a certain choice would result in &quot;you will surely die.&quot;  And we did and tumbled through the portal into our current &#39;fallen&#39; world. So this making of choices that are contrary to our nature and what we were created to be results in harm to ourselves and to those on the other end of our bad choices. Thus we have suffering, loneliness (removed from Him) and our beautiful world was cursed. </p>

<p>But... He did not leave us like this. In order to take us back from death (spiritual separation from Him), He made a way to reverse our curse. It was an extremely costly way --it required the death of someone else to &quot;surely die&quot; in our place. Someone who was not cursed, someone perfect in all their choices --Himself. And so, the unthinkable came to pass and God the Son was born and lived in His own creation. He came to die. And His death was spectacularly evil and humiliating, at the hands of those He formed from the earth. Through this death,  He tasted death for us. </p>

<p>But... we are still creatures with free will. Even though we died spiritually, we were made to be eternal, as He is. Again, we have a choice, choose His sacrifice, choose Him, since He longs to bring us back to life with Him forevermore. Just as God raised Him from the dead, so He will raise us. Or not. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t know about logic, this is what His word says about it all. Makes sense to me. May He open your eyes and heart to choose Him. </p>

<p>I have belief and practice the tradition in which I was raised. But from the standpoint of speaking from certainty like this, consider: What has God done, caused, or placed in this world that would not be evidenced in the same exact way if there were no God?</p>

<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken everything in your post is an example of this philosophical question. All the characteristics of your view of God can also be explained just as well with no God acting on the world. (Atheists would say no God explains it better, but I don&#39;t agree.)</p>

<p>But I believe all conversation on the topic, from the religious and the atheists, would be more productive if all sides would admit there&#39;s simply no certitude philosophically speaking. Because if God exists, then the design is one in which the world can pass for a world without God. And if God doesn&#39;t exist, the world can pass as a world in which a creator could absolutely be the answer to the biggest questions in the universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but my theory is that it comes from being directly confronted with the very real, very blatant probability of powerful supernatural evil, and the ways such evil is propagated through the very small percentage of people with enough power to get masses to do their bidding, and to control the direction of our collective existence, down to minute details like what we put in our bodies and our minds on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Almost every conspiracy theory on the face of it just looks like a group of people acting shady for some selfish purposes. You dig deeper and it then that circle widens to a larger group of people acting shady, and it goes up a chain of command. You learn that things are not as they seem or are portrayed to us on TV. Then you wonder how people could be so inhuman as to do such things intentionally. Then you look into the history behind those people and what they&#39;re into and realize there&#39;s generations of this weird back story that drives them. You wonder why people could do or believe such crazy things. You realize almost everyone in power has an affiliation or direct link with such evil beliefs. You look into the beliefs themselves and then recognize their signs and symbols literally <em>everywhere</em> around us It&#39;s creepy as shit. You wonder if earth is actually a form of hell and if the stories of old and new have been telling us something. </p>

<p>Now for the God part:</p>

<p>But there&#39;s also good in humanity, and so much love that exists in the unlikeliest of places. You recognize the human capacity for truth, and justice, and greatness. The core of your being craves it. You know it comes from somewhere, some Creator maybe. So you look into God&#39;s word and see that much of what you&#39;ve observed about the world is written there. The word resonates with you, fills that hunger for righteousness. You experience supernatural things yourself that line up with a good Force. The good force that you know will end up on the victor&#39;s side. </p>

<p>You realize this life is just a short trip in the matrix, and that the Real world exists in another dimension. The place where we all came from and where we&#39;re all going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, and annoyed with the implication that mysticism is the inevitable end result of skepticism. Rationalism can also emerge from the search for truth. (Aaaaand here comes the fightin&#39; words....) I think people who end up finding god at the bottom of that hole have less than fully functional critical thinking skills. The human brain likes to impose patterns on whatever the senses take in - doesn&#39;t mean those patterns exist anywhere outside of neurons and synapses. God, synchronicity, divine order...these are just your brain throwing patterns together to help you make sense of the input, as well as your ego finding a comfortable place to hang out. Mortality and random evil are hard pills to swallow. Not hard to imagine that &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; might occasionally see patterns that don&#39;t exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems to rely on people&#39;s interpretations of what they experience, and their own interpretation of what God really is, and what the implications are.</p>

<p>I guess some people lose faith altogether because they connect scriptures as more dogma of the same type they see in their political environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. </p>

<p>Which is why I (as opposed to before) don&#39;t find religion ridiculous any longer, because I think these religions are touching the truth to certain degrees. They&#39;ll (religious followers of any demographic) acknowledge themes that are echoed through various ones, such as the trinity which is worded differently throughout texts, and that there is a spirituality to mankind.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the problem begins when people adopt a vengeful god and live their lives under the impression that they must be good and pure in order for a fatherly figure to not punish them. So therefore they&#39;re required to adopt certain ways. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a child with an abusive step father that he wants to appease, and spends alot of time trying to earn acknowledge, but thinking they&#39;re not always worthy of it, and lesser beings.</p>

<p>Not attributing this to you or the majority of followers of any religion, but conveying that there&#39;s a downside when you take an inherently zealous person looking for a cause or purpose, and he is introduced to an idea that he is constantly being judged. Maybe in a sense we are, but I think we&#39;re being observed mostly.</p>

<p>If many are convinced, because their particular belief lead to some epiphany or spiritual experience, then they&#39;re all potential roads to attaining some type of enlightenment and truth, sure, if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The God i follow doesn&#39;t expect purity from us because He acknowledges we belong to a corrupted race of beings. That is the issue He has provided a solution for because, and only because He loves us.</p>

<p>We choose to hurt one another, kill one another, lie to one another, cheat one another - as a race humanity really doesn&#39;t deserve what God&#39;s offered unconditionally. That is not a vengeful deity at all.</p>

<p>Truth is always subject to enemy propaganda. Earthly things are a shadow of spiritual truths.</p>

You&#39;re definitely jumping in at a weird time (post-election), so if anything turns you off, don&#39;t write it off for good.  There are some really great breakdowns of theories, ideas and discussions that are really thought provoking.</p>

<p>That said, take anything &quot;political&quot; here with a grain of salt, it seems there are quite a few new members with agendas on <em>both</em> sides.  There&#39;s a <strong>ton</strong> of great information about other things, though, so don&#39;t let that turn you away.</p>

<p>Pizza gate is a hole you may want to jump down, if only because it&#39;s the perfect conspiracy theory:  pedophilia, witches, creepy art, pizza, hot dogs, symbolism, code words and secret messages.  If Dan Brown doesn&#39;t run with it, he&#39;s a fool.  This sub seems pretty divided on it, however.  If, like me, you don&#39;t buy it, or question any other theories, be prepared to be called a shill.  But don&#39;t take it personal, it&#39;s just this subs way of giving you a fist bump and saying &quot;agree to disagree&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you will find examples of them objectively lying, saying the number was &quot;X&quot; when you can research to find out its actually &quot;Y&quot; instead. At least I haven&#39;t seen anything like that.</p>

<p>But what you will find, in great numbers, are opinion pieces (the opinion of one Snopes writer, presumably) being used as the measuring stick of objective &#39;truth&#39;. For example, the article linked below. I found the contents of Bill Ivey&#39;s email to be reality changing. I take the honest interpretation of that email very seriously. Snopes &#39;debunked&#39; it by reaching back out to Bill and asking him to clarify. &quot;Hey we have this email that you sent a while ago. It makes you and your friends look really bad. Take all the time you need to clarify appropriately. Thanks, Snopes&quot;. It is very clear to me that Snopes as &#39;fact checker&#39; is just another malleable media tool, not a pure arbiter of truth.</p>

<p>I did a write-up on it somewhere around here, but basically they try to disprove the documented fact* that the Amish, who have <em>low vaccination rates</em>, have very low rates of autism.</p>

<p>They do this by saying that since most Amish have has <em>at least one vaccination</em> that means their low autism cannot be attributed to low vaccination.</p>

<p>The fallacy is that <em>at least one vaccination</em> includes people who have had <em>just one vaccination</em>. Just one vaccination per person is far, far below the typical vaccination rate in the USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I&#39;m not surprised by their rapid turnaround, it&#39;s their whole concept. Debunking a story after it&#39;s run out of gas is missing the point. In the end it&#39;s just one more source of potential information and another opinion. It isn&#39;t suspicious that someone wants their opinion heard while it is still relevant.

<p>You guys. You&#39;re so worried about the wrong stuff. Its like youre smart enough to know youre getting fucked, but not smart enough to figure out by who, or why. Keep it coming. The comic relief you guys provide is well worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but my theory is that it comes from being directly confronted with the very real, very blatant probability of powerful supernatural evil, and the ways such evil is propagated through the very small percentage of people with enough power to get masses to do their bidding, and to control the direction of our collective existence, down to minute details like what we put in our bodies and our minds on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Almost every conspiracy theory on the face of it just looks like a group of people acting shady for some selfish purposes. You dig deeper and it then that circle widens to a larger group of people acting shady, and it goes up a chain of command. You learn that things are not as they seem or are portrayed to us on TV. Then you wonder how people could be so inhuman as to do such things intentionally. Then you look into the history behind those people and what they&#39;re into and realize there&#39;s generations of this weird back story that drives them. You wonder why people could do or believe such crazy things. You realize almost everyone in power has an affiliation or direct link with such evil beliefs. You look into the beliefs themselves and then recognize their signs and symbols literally <em>everywhere</em> around us It&#39;s creepy as shit. You wonder if earth is actually a form of hell and if the stories of old and new have been telling us something. </p>

<p>Now for the God part:</p>

<p>But there&#39;s also good in humanity, and so much love that exists in the unlikeliest of places. You recognize the human capacity for truth, and justice, and greatness. The core of your being craves it. You know it comes from somewhere, some Creator maybe. So you look into God&#39;s word and see that much of what you&#39;ve observed about the world is written there. The word resonates with you, fills that hunger for righteousness. You experience supernatural things yourself that line up with a good Force. The good force that you know will end up on the victor&#39;s side. </p>

<p>You realize this life is just a short trip in the matrix, and that the Real world exists in another dimension. The place where we all came from and where we&#39;re all going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems to rely on people&#39;s interpretations of what they experience, and their own interpretation of what God really is, and what the implications are.</p>

<p>I guess some people lose faith altogether because they connect scriptures as more dogma of the same type they see in their political environment.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d say man has a spiritual side, but I wouldn&#39;t call it religious.</p>
