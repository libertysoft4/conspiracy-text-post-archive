What if we just keep dying without even knowing we just go on with our lives like nothing happen this Is a possible reason why the Mandela effect happens so often.

    <div class="md"><p>Usually what happens when you die is there will be a period when you don&#39;t remember the life you just had. I call it death amnesia.It&#39;s a state similAr to deep sleep where your objective awareness is suspended. It&#39;s much like a dream where your consciousness is not as connecting to the waking awareness, when it&#39;s not objective it is subjective. So death is more akin to a subjective state. </p>

<p>During this time after death is when you transition. This is a period where you do recall the previous life experience,  it you are also simultaneously shedding the objective perception. This is because in death there is no physicality, so why have a perception that creates physical imagery? You don&#39;t need it so it&#39;s shredded. </p>

<p>After that it&#39;s more choices. Will you live again on earth or some other physical dimension. Will you move onto others types of realities completely? It matters not. It&#39;s a choice and there are Always ways to exist and create and explore consciousness. It really is infinite. Some of it we can&#39;t even fathom because we are tied to this type of reality and perception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea you can. First though it helps if you believe in multiple lives, or if you have self knowledge. A lot of our reincarnation beliefs get tied in with karma. Karma though is a distortion. Each life is a brand new experience which is why we forget all of our other lives so that this one can be New and original. If we actually carried the baggage of every life with us, this life&#39;s experience would be watered down and convoluted, to put it one way.</p>

<p>But, if you are open to multiple lifetimes, open to that awareness, then begin connecting with times in history you have a draw to. If you are drawn to a certain time and place in history it is most likely you have a life there. Even though it may seem fuzzy at first you use your intuition to connect with that life. You will get impressions, you may actually visualize this life, or see an experience unfolding or you will just know something about it. These are signs you are tapping into the memories held in your souls consciousness.</p>

<p>I have connected with at least ten of my lives. From a &#39;sorceror&#39; in the dark ages, to a lonely British piano maker in the 19th Century. I was Clyde barrow, my current girlfriend was Bonnie, together we connected with that life. Which brings up another point, that many of the people you know now..family, friends, most likely you have many other lives with those around you. So that&#39;s another good way to explore this subject is through the current relationships and how those transcend lifetimes. Hope this gives some direction in how to approach connecting with past, and even future lives. Future as well, because outside our perception of linear time, all of existence happens now, it&#39;s only separated by time frames.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same way I know this life I&#39;m living now is mine. It has my specific personality tone. You make an excellent point though. At the essence level we are all connected. Or soul level. It&#39;s not a level though but it&#39;s one of the closet words we have for another type of focus. Another &#39;layer&#39; would probably be a better description of that state of consciousness we there is no separation.</p>

<p>On that layer, we are all connected and our actions are more instantaneous and without boundaries between us. So let&#39;s take my Bonnie and Clyde life. I would be the directing focus of Clyde. Though many other essences observe that focus simultaneous. Cause again on this essential layer of consciousness our personalities are mixing and fragmenting so parts of other personalities are present in the personality of Clyde even though I am directing the focus.</p>

<p>Consider that about your own personality as well. You are the directing focus of your life, though your personality is also fragmented from others, but they are still present in the makeup of the focus you are directing. These other personalities I call Observing Essences. For lack of a better word. They are part of your consciousness though you specifically steer the ship.</p>

<p>Getting into the subjective aspect of consciousness is tricky to explain so some terms need to be redefined to accommodate the awareness. But if y o u have questions about this aspect of self I will do my best to explain. </p>

<p>We do so much in our dreams but only a tiny portion of the activity is carried into the waking life. Consider this, maybe you haven&#39;t before. That dreams don&#39;t just stop when we wake up. Under the the waking awareness you have presently there is a dream going on.</p>

<p>That is the closest in words I can get you to the understanding of the nature of reality. Just like when you dream a major portion of the waking awareness is unfocused. When you are awake that portion of 
Dreaming consciousness is unfocused. The irony is up until about a hundred years ago we haven&#39;t retained the awareness of one state while in the other. So we don&#39;t remember our dreams when we wake and we don&#39;t remember our lives when we sleep. That will begin to change. It&#39;s a shift in consciousness presently.</p>

<p>enter accurate birth information only. (Check your birth certificate to make sure of the birth time) </p>

<p>You&#39;ll scroll down and see a table and planets and a blue symbol next to something called the Asc Node  .</p>

<p>That&#39;s your North Node ( life quest I guess) and south Node is your past life. </p>

<p>Whatever sign is next to the asc Node look up &quot;north Node  (insert that sign here)&quot; and listen to one of the videos. Most of them will talk about your South Node as well. </p>

<p>What do you think about these matrix thoughts?
DNA is the blueprint of our individual software programs. Consciousness is a CPU running this program and intuition is the access to the shared RAM of the datacenter (kind of the Acacia Records). When we die, it simply means the program has stopped running, and the CPU will start processing another available program (life experience). All the stored data from the previous program are then ready to be overwritten, but just like on a HDD it&#39;s not cleaned up, it&#39;s just marked as empty, and maybe reserved for a new program. People remember stuff from &quot;earlier lives&quot;. No doubt about it. That could indicate that some programs have the ability to read this &quot;empty&quot; storage, just like recovery software, and they believe that they have been reincarnated.</p>

<p>Just a thought i had last night. I don&#39;t believe we&#39;re software and programs, but I don&#39;t disbelieve it either :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also mentions we&#39;re not capable of comprehending or accepting the discoveries of his time :D The concept of death only makes sense to me if you see yourself as your body. If you perceive consciousness both from a higher and smaller scale, you realize that we are just one small step on an infinite staircase of self organizing systems. This staircase is the nature of life he speaks of.</p>

<p>I cannot answer your last question. Wouldn&#39;t you go 90k years (lame guess) back in time to watch what happened to the guys that build the pyramid, if you could? Just because he&#39;s able to travel a relatively short period of time back into his past, (travel in space he says) does not mean he knows how to travel in different universes. It&#39;s hard to discuss, because we all have different interpretations of terms such as life, death, universe etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does happen. Part of the death amnesia is not knowing you have died. You will eventually figure it out. There will be a difference and that is that the reality in the death amnesia period will be created only by you. You will figure out you are hallucinating everything you are experiencing and there will be no surprises. You won&#39;t sense things the same like you do with the 5 senses now. You will Understand the fabric of perception is being put together by yourself and then you will begin to take it apart. </p>

<p>Mostly in the death amnesia the strongest held beliefs are reflected as a reality. So say you live strongly in the faith and heaven hell paradigm, in the amnesia you will reflect either one of those outcomes. It can be Intense, from what I hear some people spend what would be decades of our time in one of these self created states of reality, because they believed very intensely they had done good .. or evil. The onus is on the person though to find the cue, or the the assistance being offered by other souls to get them to understand they can move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mind.. let me offer an explanation, you don&#39;t have to accept it but I will tell you briefly what it is.</p>

<p>You are close in thinking spirit is the true form of the mind. Let me help you direct the accuracy towards the energy centers of the body.</p>

<p>These centers, that can correspond to tones and colors and qualities, are not fixed rotating spheres within the body. Rather they are a swirling , mixing, radiating , powerful source of energy. Their source is actually from the accumulation of many layers of consciousness being mixed together. A raw, purely natural and somewhat unseen source of power within each of us.</p>

<p>So, along comes you. Another powerful expression of consciousness energy with an awareness and a specific type of development seeking action. A propensity for form and creation. A desire to be that.</p>

<p>So you magnate to this other grouping of energy centers swirling. And you mix with it and you grow together and become linked together.</p>

<p>That forms what is the mind. The mind is not centered in the brain. The mind is the Aura. The spirit. It is the communion of the holy ghost, you. with spirit, or the energy of the body.</p>

<p>This process transcends its description and has to be conceptualized with the mind to understand that action of your personality gestalt of consciousness merging with many other forms of energy to produce life. Because that&#39;s what we do every moment. It is the nature of consciousness to link, expand, and become more of itself.</p>

<p>Specifically though before I get on a tangent, the mind can be seen. Hold up your finger. Look at it slightly refocused. See that glowing light around it? That&#39;s your aura. Which is also your mind. It&#39;s that light that emits all around you. Sometimes you may see it one color or another.  Sometimes it expands and contracts depending on what you are doing in that moment.</p>

<p>The mind like I said has a power, it is compressed qualities of consciousness. It has avenues like imagination and intuition which we use to form probabilities. Thoughts which can translate experience along with held beliefs to form explanations. Feelings which signal us of our current present environment. And a sexual desire to form more groupings of consciousness. For starters, to get warmed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a big believer in quantum immortality as well as some other related principles. For instance I believe that, until the moment you pick up your phone and call your old friend jimbo from highschool, there is no certainty as to what has happened to him since the last time you talked. The universe hasn&#39;t &#39;decided&#39; so to speak because you as a conscious observer haven&#39;t requested or needed that information. The moment you call, via some equations and algorhytms (of incredibly, but probably finite, complexity), the universe collapses all possible states of jimbo into one timeline, and then he picks up and tells you about his life. Or maybe his widow picks up and tells you. Eerie to think about, but as someone who &#39;magically&#39; survived (atleast in this timeline, derp) several incredibly dangerous situations in his life, I can&#39;t help but believe this to be how the world works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Furthermore, the version of jimbo you interact will respond to the energy you are currently emitting. That energy is projected outward and mixes with jimbos.

We would call that &#39;hanging out.&#39; But in order for that to happen many different energies group together to form the experience.</p>

<p>Of course the variety of experience could be infinite. But the power is in the moment and what energy are you attracting and repelling? That would determine which jimbo you get.</p>

<p>IMO this is not the sub for this as it does not involve any group or any nefarious plan or scheme. <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> , <a href="/r/Psychonaut">/r/Psychonaut</a> would be better alternatives.</p>
