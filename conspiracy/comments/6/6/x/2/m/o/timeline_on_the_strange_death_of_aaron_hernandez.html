<p>Death Day April 19,2017</p>

<p>TMZ put out a post on Hernandez saying that he died and innocent man because of a Mass. law that states when someone dies and their case is in appeal the death of the person erases all criminal proceedings in effect making him innocent of all charges. This means that instead of Odin&#39;s family getting the money it cancels that and all goes to his daughter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>agree.</p>

<p>I think in the end he realized he could spend life in prison and his daughter/shayanna are fucked. Or he could off his crazy self (PCP damaged self) and reward his daughter/shayanna with up to 6M. </p>

<p>I think it was that or he had a psychotic episode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hernandez also used his own blood to draw on the walls of his cell.</p>

<p>&quot;5 Investigates’ Kathy Curran has learned that one of the drawings was what’s known as the unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God. The image is similar to what is found on the back of U.S. currency.<br/>
Below the pyramid, Hernandez wrote &quot;ILLUMINATI&quot; in capital letters.</p>

<p>The illuminati is a person or group claiming to have religious enlightenment or knowledge. The illuminati has also been the subject of several theories, including one that claims they control of the world.</p>

<p>Above the pyramid, Hernandez drew an oval with rays coming from the edges.</p>

<p>Nearby, rosary beads hung on the wall of his cell.</p>

<p>5 Investigates has also learned more about the letters left for Hernandez’s family.</p>

<p>In one, he wrote that he was entering the &quot;timeless realm&quot; and would see them in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>A person with that power and influence would surely be interesting to those in power... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just copied and pasted what they reported. The illuminati symbolism has become popularized for a while now. And sure, they&#39;ve reduced it to a joke. But the truth behind it still remains, and I just find it fascinating how someone at his level and influence would choose to draw these symbols on his wall right before he killed himself... It just confirms the theories about people at that level being touched by them, that we wouldn&#39;t have ever known about otherwise. How many other players are into this stuff? They won&#39;t talk about it when they&#39;re doing good because it&#39;s how they get paid... Then they are too afraid to say anything only until just before death? Very odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like others have said I&#39;m glad you&#39;re posting such a well sourced discussion, but I gotta say it seems almost typical of unhinged people killing themselves. </p>

<p>Sure, people are eliminated all the time and often covered up as a suicide in prison. But suicides in prison are common, and suicides happen all the time to people who show virtually no signs. </p>

<p>But I see no reason to believe any of that. The messages he left weren&#39;t even warnings or cries for help but instead religious. It&#39;s not uncommon for those about to commit suicide to become deeply religious right beforehand and leave religious messages. </p>

<p>If this death is a conspiracy then  many suicides by schizos and people with bipolar disorder are conspiracies because they leave similar messages behind lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agree.</p>

<p>I think in the end he realized he could spend life in prison and his daughter/shayanna are fucked. Or he could off his crazy self (PCP damaged self) and reward his daughter/shayanna with up to 6M. </p>

<p>I think it was that or he had a psychotic episode. </p>
