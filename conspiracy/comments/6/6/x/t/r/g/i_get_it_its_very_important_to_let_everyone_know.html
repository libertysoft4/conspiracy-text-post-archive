<p>My favorite part is how it&#39;s claimed that FE is somehow a psy-op lmaooooooo. The literature supporting it has been around a lot longer than some silly psy-op, nevermind the fact that this psy-op claim is backed up with zero evidence. They just keep saying &quot;it&#39;s a psy-op hurhur!&quot;</p>

<p>Look I am done trying spread the word on FE. It is just very interesting to see it get &quot;mocked and ridiculed&quot;. It&#39;s so brigaded that it should be leant more credence. </p>

<p>Also a hearty Fuck You to anyone calling people stupid for questioning the obvious bullshit narrative. I can&#39;t wait to see you all on the way to Mars /s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think there is a lot more credibility to hollow earth than flat earth. It&#39;s interesting that with so much attention on Antartica lately, flat earth theory has been brought up continuously by celebrities, yet I haven&#39;t heard one speak of a hollow earth.

    <div class="md"><p>The is no psy-op, at least I don&#39;t see any actual evidence that there is some department somehow dedicated to proliferating it. FE movement is organic, and it really rests on the lack of credible evidence of a round Earth. People have caught on to the ball-earth lie. The evidence just doesn&#39;t add up. Hollow Earth evidence is pretty scant, but I wouldn&#39;t discount it. I don&#39;t know how the these different lands connect, but they seem to exist in plenty of stories. Hollow Earth is a part of it, whether it&#39;s technically hollow or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% serious. You cannot show any real proof that the earth is round. And in a very real way you can track the lie as it evolved. A Trip To The Moon came out in 1902 lol so well before anyone could even guess that it would be possible. It has been thrust on our minds, we are basically forced to believe the Earth is round. </p>

<p>And look if you have some proof that doesn&#39;t require me to &#39;just believe some scientist&#39; then I am all ears.</p>

<p>The round earth lies are hilarious at this point. Some Indian rocket supposedly carried over 100 sats into orbit hahaha of course no video of this monumental occasion. Also I look at the Cassini images as they come in from Saturn(they must have a gigantic radio tower on that sat to be able to send data back that far lmaoooo) and the pics look so stupid. Really man it&#39;s time to face up to the charade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Number 1. How do satellites orbit a flat earth ? Do you deny satellites exist also. Bearing in mind you&#39;re probably typing these comments on a mobile phone ? 
Number 2. The fact that at many points on the earth you can actually see the curvature of the earth with your own eyes ? 
Number 3. How do you explain the fact the earth is flat but every other planet/ moon in our solar system is round. I also don&#39;t need scientists to tell me this as I have a telescope.
Number 4. If the earth was flat at some point on my round the world flight I would have to nose dive 90 degrees or risk flying off in to space ? 
Number 5. How do eclipses work the way they do if the earth were flat only a slit of light would be blocked ? 
There are many many more it&#39;s just a ridiculous idea I&#39;m big into conspiracies and ME and all sorts but this one is just crazy I&#39;m sorry but it just is.</p>

<li><p>Satellites are fake AF. Perhaps you didn&#39;t realize that satellite TV has been around longer than satellites. That&#39;s because the dishes are all pointed at towers, hence why you never see a satellite dish pointed straight up like they would if they aimed at things in orbit. </p></li>
<li><p>You cannot see a curve from anywhere on earth, and the higher you go the horizon line continues to rise with you eyes. I have flown many times, no curve up there. </p></li>
<li><p>Simple point of fact, no one truly knows what those things are. Your telescope can show you points of light that happen to be round and it is certainly not an indicator of what they are composed. </p></li>
<li><p>You are making a great point that there should be gyro data from planes that support a round earth, yet there are not. In fact, many emergency plane landings expose a flat earth. You should check out emergency landings in Moscow. There are several, and their points of origin and ending do not make sense on a round earth. I have watched the tracking of planes over the southern hemisphere and they fall off tracking and then magically appear again at their destination. </p></li>
<li><p>You are making weird assumptions that you can&#39;t back up with this. I don&#39;t know what an eclipse actually is, especially as there been eclipses recorded where a third body would be necessary. </p></li>

<li>If stateliness are fake how the fuck can I see them with my naked eye on a night passing over. Are they fake ? </li>
<li>Not true there are many places you can see the curvature of the earth. If you want an easy way to see this I point you to the top gear episode I think it was in Germany. Then again top gear is probably in on it too. </li>
<li>What sort of explanation is this haha that&#39;s just you admitting you&#39;re wrong and can&#39;t give an answer. I can see Jupiter very clearly and it&#39;s moons but I&#39;m presuming they have been put there just to make us all think the earth is flat (you really can&#39;t be serious) ?</li>
<li>Have you ever noticed planes fly up and across or down and across on their flight plan to follow the quickest route (also known as the curvature of the earth)</li>
<li>I&#39;m not making any assumptions that I can&#39;t back up I be seen it with my own eyes if the earth was flat an eclipse would not be possible. Have you noticed how the sun is flat too and the moon or are you saying as you said in point three just because we can see them doesn&#39;t mean they are round haha.

    <div class="md"><p>The international space station is hundreds of miles away I can see that. Stars are light years away I can see those. The sun is millions of miles away I can see that the moon is 250&#39;000 miles away I can see that. The reason I can see them is because light from our &quot;round sun&quot; shines off the solar panels and body of the satellite witch then reflects to my eye. Or are you telling me the light from the sun is not strong enough to reach my eye ? Every single moon planet or star we have ever discovered or have seen with our own eyes is round fair enough a few moons have a strange shape but they certainly aren&#39;t flat. The fact is you can&#39;t give valid answers to my previous statements so you&#39;re not starting to get defensive and trying to draw me in to an argument so that you can dodge the truth.

    <div class="md"><p>You are not seeing the ISS cause it&#39;s not up there. The ISS is the biggest joke ever. The one guy claimed to live up there for like a year hahaha! Just watch some of the ISS vids they come out with every week. They are painfully fake, with many obvious tells such as harnesses and what not. </p>

<p>Yes you see stars, but you don&#39;t know how far away they are. The idea that you could see something a few trillion miles away is laughable. </p>

<p>The fact is you can&#39;t give valid answers to your own statements but you are so brainwashed that you are unwilling or unable to see it. You are the one continuing this so don&#39;t accuse me of starting an argument with you. It&#39;s all on you &#39;PAL&#39; lmaooooooooooooooo</p>

Have you had a look at the sun have you noticed how bright it is the sun is a relatively small star and it would still burn your eyes out if you stared at it for a couple of minutes that&#39;s how you can see something trillions of miles away not everything is powered by AA batteries unlike your brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you actually understand how light works? Or did someone tell you. </p>

<p>You make a great point with sun even when you didn&#39;t realize it. The is blinding when it is directly overhead, but when it is far away at &#39;sunset&#39; you can look right at it. If it were 93 million miles away then the intensity would be the same level regardless of angle. But it is actually much closer hence the difference in brightness as it travels farther away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot wrap my head at the amount of rejected science from Flat Earthers. A big component to their theory is that NASA is this entity that is fooling us into believing a globe so they can suck in billions of dollars. NASA&#39;s funding has been cut 75%. Plus the amount of funds it would actually take to cover up a globe lie...seriously. We&#39;re talking the entire education system, college, astrophysicist from every country, chemist, mathematicians, governments from every country...I mean everything. </p>

<p>Satellites being fake? We can visibly see them pass over us, we can even see them more clearly if we had a telescope. Did they manufacture holographic lens into every single telescope made?</p>

I also struggle to understand how anyone can be this ignorant in the modern world but apparently there&#39;s quite a few. As you say pretty much every single person in the world must be in on it from ship captains to scientists to astronauts, Astronomers to the average joe using a backyard telescope anybody with anything about them can observe how the stars move across the year but then again they aren&#39;t stars because there is &quot;no way you could see something trillions of miles away&quot; it really is laughable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently man. Some of the stars we see may not even actually be there because of how long the light takes to travel to the earth-for us Humans to see. I bought a telescope for my son so we can observe the moon. Just so happened that when I bought it, the ISS was flying by. Our local news station covered a bit during the times we could see it. You can visibly see it from the naked eye, but in the telescope it&#39;s really cool. But hey, my telescope is fake and what I saw was not real...or anyone in my area who has a telescope that post photos on facebook. We&#39;re all so indoctrinated with facts.</p>

<p>If the Earth is round and spinning then the rate of spin should be perceptible as in the closer you get to the equator the faster you are spinning and vice versa the closer you get to the north pole you will be spinning slower. As far as I know this hasn&#39;t been demonstrated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The favorite retort of any Glober is &quot;how is x possible on a flat earth?&quot; Typically x is some convoluted nonsense based on the junk science of heliocentrism. I stopped responding to these people.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve been mulling over lately about FE, is when did it <em>really</em> become accepted by the masses? We know Copernicus and Galileo were laughed at and threatened by the Christian Church. It seems like the Church of England, after the Reformation was the first to teach it in the late 1600s. It&#39;s clear from all the  FE books around in the late 1800s that it was an idea with still quite a few detractors among writers, not to mention what the average rural person probably thought. Of course the invention of flight really forced the perpetrators of the Globe to kick it into to high gear in the 20th Century, and the post war period saw a frenetic period of IGY in 1958 followed by fake Space stuff which sealed the deal.  So it really isn&#39;t a 500 year old fraud as much as an 1800s on fraud, which puts it in the same time line as the other great scientific frauds: evolution, big bang, dinosaurs. Along with the spinning ball, these four beliefs constitute the modern nihilistic, disconnected, uprooted, easily manipulated human mindset of the 20th and 21st century</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are in a speeding vehicle do you somehow &quot;feel&quot; that you are moving quickly? Without your eyes you wouldn&#39;t have a clue about how fast you are going. Humans do not have this mystery sense that you are suggesting that people are supposed to have. </p>

<p>If you are in a speeding vehicle and the brakes are applied sharply what happens? The vehicle is slowed quickly but you are still moving forward. You are moving at the same speed as the car. If the car slows down too quickly you&#39;ll hit the windshield. Everyone who has ridden in a vehicle has experienced this effect to some extent.</p>

<p>We are moving along with the Earth and everything else that is here with us on the Earth. Everything is moving together at the same speed. As you change location you will gradually increase or decrease your own speed to match where you are located. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed... </p>

<p>I&#39;m typically the skeptic as well. Obviously, there are plenty of real conspiracies and other mysteries. However, there are plenty of hoaxes out there. Unfortunately too many people will just accept something at face value and believe it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s something about human nature. We assume that other people are similar to ourselves. Most people wouldn&#39;t make something up just to fuck with people on the Internet. Therefore we find it difficult to believe that someone would just make up a story no matter how outlandish it is. </p>

<p>Another reason is the lack of real scientific understanding. People who don&#39;t understand science very well are more likely to believe something that doesn&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>The ones that really get under my skin are the YouTube videos that try to make a big deal out of a tiny observation and try to claim that the whole event was staged. Usually, it&#39;s something like blood doesn&#39;t flow that way. </p>

<p>Most people are comparing what they&#39;re seeking against what they&#39;ve seen in movies. Special effects don&#39;t necessarily match what happens in real life. Special effects are more of an artists creation of what they are trying to show. Often times it&#39;s exaggerated for effect. Real flesh behaves differently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, people are accepting that the people making the video are being honest. They don&#39;t stop to think that YouTube is a good way to make money. All you need to do is have videos that people watch. Seems obvious to me that it&#39;s the YouTube video that is fake not the other way around. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on board with 911 being a conspiracy. I even believe that it&#39;s quite possible that they baited Japan into Pearl Harbor. Any time the Government needs to get the public behind a particular decision they can count on a mass casually event to get most everyone to accept it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit the nail on the head 9/11 and pearl harbour are the two I am inclined to believe. But only because the reasons for them are entirely plausible. In both events America needed a reason to get involved I hope that 9/11 wasn&#39;t a false flag but I also wouldn&#39;t put it past the government. The public conscience sometimes needs to be altered and something like 9/11 is a sure fire way to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any &quot;literature&quot; supporting such an antiquated idea must be found in the fiction section. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine how any educated and reasonably modern person could believe such an idea.</p>

<p>Modern aircraft and ships circumnavigate the World routinely.</p>

<p>People on boats noticed a long time ago that you can&#39;t see all of a boat if it&#39;s a long distance away. You&#39;ll see the top of the mast but the rest of the boat is below the horizon. As you move closer you gradually see more of the mast until you are close enough to see the whole ship. </p>

<p>Satellites and GPS are based on the spherical Earth. </p>

<p>The rounded shadow of the Earth can be seen during a lunar eclipse if you take enough images of the event. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mEfFnYM.jpg">Multiple Lunar Eclipse Images </a></p>

<p>There is also a mountain of scientific evidence from various disciplines that support the spherical Earth. </p>

<p>We also have expert testamony on the subject. For example the thread from earlier today where a surveyor was debunking the conspiracy theory about the flat Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one I deal with all the time. I&#39;m an OTR truck driver. It&#39;s a pretty common trip for me to travel from California to New Jersey and back. Typically a round trip takes me about 9 to 12 days depending on how much time I spend at the destination and the path I take for the return trip. </p>

<p>If the Earth is flat how is it that the sun rises and sets at different times at different locations? I lose or gain 3 hours depending on the direction of travel. I keep my logs on California time and each trip I can clearly see the difference as I travel across the country. </p>

<p>How does this happen if the Earth is flat? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a few flat earth videos with an open mind and i must say, the arguments that some posters presented were embarasing to say the least. The phenomena which they said is proof for a flat earth is quite literally the opposite. For example there was this guy who watched tree shadows from a plane and said that all the shadows should be lined equally and because they are not (in his opinion), that proves that the sun is much closer to the earth than we think. However this guy obviously has zero clue about how perspective works. After that i couldnt take anything else he said seriously. There was an other guy who interpreted flight paths and he ibviously didnt take into account the smaller volume of the earth at the top, so he concluded how flight paths dont make sense on a spherical earth. He just look stupid from there onward. Then there was a guy who actually said that how do planes moves if they travel counter to rotation of the earth, he tought that obviously planes would stay in same position because of that. After that i couldnt take the fe theorists seriously.</p>

<p>So OP please provide me with some decent videos because this is something i want to explore. I was huge into hollow earth and i wanted to examine fe theory in the same way. I always look for the physics perspective and so far fe explanations lacked heavily in that regard.</p>

<p>Bottom line, even if you are a smart guy and a proponent of this theory, you have some reaaaaally dumb people on your side, dragging the theory into the ground.</p>
