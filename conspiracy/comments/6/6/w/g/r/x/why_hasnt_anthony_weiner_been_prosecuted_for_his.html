<p>Anthony Wiener was sexting a minor and still hasn&#39;t been prosecuted for it. This seems rather weird considering it&#39;s highly illegal. Anthony is married to Huma Abedin who is the right hand woman to Hillary Clinton, and used to represent New York&#39;s 9th congressional district from January 1999 until June 2011.</p>

<p>People often dismiss Anthony Wiener alongside the Pizzagate investigations, because when he sent nude pictures to minors he wasn&#39;t covered in marinara. When he was arrested and his laptop was confiscated. Rumors are there was a folder named &quot;Life insurance&quot; that many people have speculated involved Bill and Hillary - something Huma and Anthony could use as a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card.</p>

<p>I really hope that the FBI got to the servers first, but I fear that he was able to delete the evidence.</p>

<p>Luckily me and lots of other anons collected lots of evidence at <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/9578637.html">https://8ch.net/pol/res/9578637.html</a> (NSFL!) and <a href="https://voat.co/v/tribenet">https://voat.co/v/tribenet</a> (NSFL!).

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Think of tribe.net as a predecessor to reddit, users can make subtribes for their interests. It was rather popular until when Facebook and reddit appeared and the user number dropped, so revenue dropped and the number of moderators got smaller and smaller. According to some articles only one person mantained the site in the end (see WHOIS on the parked domain page that now comes up when trying to access tribe.net), the site is owned by Pincus, the technology is owned by Cisco.
That made it easy for pedophiles to act undisturbed, as almost nobody else used the site anymore. This was known to the mods, as some tribes were closed due to CP as early as 2005.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a controversial move, on December 20, 2005, tribe.net decided to prohibit sexually explicit content, partially in response to the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act. This move disappointed many users, as Tribe to that point had been notable for a permissive content policy.[2][3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end however, there was no moderation at all it seems and incredibly fucked up tribes appeared, which I won&#39;t mention here, I recommend you to read the reddit threads and decide for yourself, if you want to see the evidence. Basically users shared their fantasies, pictures of their kids, their kik and Skype usernames to meet in real life. Topics have titles like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Slammed up perv, looking for younger (10+) bois... </p>

<p>Meth + boy = ;)</p>

<p>sadistic pedo </p>

<p>New born baby aval to use. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is lots of evidence that these tribes were NOT just simple fantasy sharing, I recommend anyone who wants to see the evidence to go through the 8chan thread, a strong stomach is necessary though, so be warned.</p>

<p>Anthony Wiener was sexting a minor </p>

<p>Seems there some dispute about this, there was a story that it was her mother he had an online/phone connection with and the woman&#39;s daughter got a hold of her phone and was texting AW as the mom without his knowledge. If this is the case and he can prove it then the prosecution probably wouldn&#39;t be too aggressive in prosecuting the case. As for the laptop the only thing that come from that has been inflamatory statements meant to titillate and fuel the hype train since we have seen exactly zero evidence from it so far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and then there&#39;s this: </p>

<p><em>Weiner did provide BuzzFeed News with a copy of a May 13 email the girl sent to a teacher, which she also CC’d to him, telling the teacher she had fabricated allegations about Weiner:
I recently shared with you a story about a former congressman. I contacted Anthony Weiner.
Our online chats were never inappropriate, he was always very helpful and kind. I wanted to publish my story. He was the best candidate to pin the story to. The story needed a hoax to ride on.</em></p>

<p><em>Speaking of candidates the election is coming up and his wife is Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff. He doesn’t have any credibility, I assumed no one would question the allegations.</em></p>

<p><em>It was unfair to lie to you and my father. It was unfair to spread this false accusation against Anthony Weiner.</em></p>

<p><em>He has done nothing to deserve this. I am sorry for lying to you, I hope this doesn’t affect the bond we have formed over the years.</em></p>

<p>and follows up with this;</p>

<p><em>The teen told the Daily Mail she sent the email to a fake address — not actually one that belonged to her teacher — after feeling “pressured” to retract confessions she had made about their relationship to her father and the teacher.
The girl told the Mail she did not wish to press charges because she believes her relationship with Weiner was “consensual” and “romantic.”</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why is because every politician is involved in shit like this. Or they are aware stuff like this is going on. It&#39;s only when they get backed into a corner, is when they come out publicly about it. The NYPD found his laptop and the FBI took the case over and made it a non issue. Most of the elite don&#39;t get charged with pedophilia. Look at catholic priests. Is it really a coincidence that a lot of them have been busted for fiddling kids? I think not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Think of tribe.net as a predecessor to reddit, users can make subtribes for their interests. It was rather popular until when Facebook and reddit appeared and the user number dropped, so revenue dropped and the number of moderators got smaller and smaller. According to some articles only one person mantained the site in the end (see WHOIS on the parked domain page that now comes up when trying to access tribe.net), the site is owned by Pincus, the technology is owned by Cisco.
That made it easy for pedophiles to act undisturbed, as almost nobody else used the site anymore. This was known to the mods, as some tribes were closed due to CP as early as 2005.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a controversial move, on December 20, 2005, tribe.net decided to prohibit sexually explicit content, partially in response to the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act. This move disappointed many users, as Tribe to that point had been notable for a permissive content policy.[2][3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end however, there was no moderation at all it seems and incredibly fucked up tribes appeared, which I won&#39;t mention here, I recommend you to read the reddit threads and decide for yourself, if you want to see the evidence. Basically users shared their fantasies, pictures of their kids, their kik and Skype usernames to meet in real life. Topics have titles like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Slammed up perv, looking for younger (10+) bois... </p>

<p>Meth + boy = ;)</p>

<p>sadistic pedo </p>

<p>New born baby aval to use. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is lots of evidence that these tribes were NOT just simple fantasy sharing, I recommend anyone who wants to see the evidence to go through the 8chan thread, a strong stomach is necessary though, so be warned.</p>
