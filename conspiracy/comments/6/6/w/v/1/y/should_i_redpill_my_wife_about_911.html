</blockquote>

<p>Sure, keeping women in the dark about the truth will do us wonders.</p>

<p>It seems like you&#39;re saying a woman&#39;s part of our progression is to be quiet and only talk about the pretty things. Both men and women can see the darkness and the light, it doesn&#39;t need to be separated by sex and it shouldn&#39;t be. We are meant to be strong together. </p>

<p>Giving the advice of not telling your wife/girlfriend how you view the world because you think she&#39;s too fragile due to her being a woman is absurd. You&#39;re also putting all of this burden and pressure on the man, when it doesn&#39;t need to be. Share the pressure and the pain, and more critical thinking and planning will come to light. Stop being silent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i said no such thing.
my current partner is very aware of certain aspects of what is occuring. for the past few days they were very distant and full of concern. when asked what was going on with them, was confronted with serious emotional concern about the direction of the topic on DPRK and the potentials for a serious and even nuclear war.
i reiterated that we can likely do nothing to change this situation beyond loving our friends, family and spreading wellbeing with whoever we share time with. this helps them to relax and focus on the things we can do to change this direction. telling our partners they should be freaking out about the direction of the world serves no purpose but spreading fear.</p>

<p>Sure, keeping women in the dark about the truth will do us wonders.</p>

<p>It seems like you&#39;re saying a woman&#39;s part of our progression is to be quiet and only talk about the pretty things. Both men and women can see the darkness and the light, it doesn&#39;t need to be separated by sex and it shouldn&#39;t be. We are meant to be strong together. </p>

<p>Giving the advice of not telling your wife/girlfriend how you view the world because you think she&#39;s too fragile due to her being a woman is absurd. You&#39;re also putting all of this burden and pressure on the man, when it doesn&#39;t need to be. Share the pressure and the pain, and more critical thinking and planning will come to light. Stop being silent. </p>
