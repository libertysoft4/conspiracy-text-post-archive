<p>Considering the playing field they had and the results, one datapoint is enough. Sometimes two boxers only need to fight once to decisively know who&#39;s better.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They still get to choose their staff. In fact, that&#39;s one of the top three most important parts of the presidency, appointing staff. Sounds like Trump is better at that, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The banking cabal makes money destabilizing economies and financing wars.</p>

<p>The political crime families, like Bush and Clinton, make money taking bribes and trafficking drugs/guns/people.</p>

<p>Trump made his money on hotels and casinos. He needs a robust middle class to stay at his hotels and gamble in his casinos, or his kids are left with empty buildings, defaulted loans, and bankrupt companies.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t want to change the system. The system is already changing to billionaires and poor, with no middle class in between. He is financially motivated to reverse that change and change it back to a strong middle class.</p>

<p>The bankers and political crime families make more money bankrupting the middle class.</p>

<p>Not everyone makes their money the same way. We are better aligning with people with mutual interests, like a middle class to buy their products, than people who want to drug us, kidnap us, shoot us, and make us poor for their own enrichment.</p>
