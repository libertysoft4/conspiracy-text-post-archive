        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The &quot;clicking&quot; sounds still happen. I honestly don&#39;t see the point other than to annoy and cause distress. </p>

<p>So last Saturday morning I wake up to some people banging on our front door frantically. The dog is in the backyard flipping out at them.
I get out of bed, look out the window and see three people in neon green shirts. A black guy on the opposite side of the road, looking like a lookout. A white man and woman at our front door looking freaked out, in distress. She flings her arms out and they all run into the &quot;rape van&quot;, you know, the white vans with no windows, and they bolt out of there. I mean, they had a driver keeping the van on, and when the lady almost finished hurriedly slamming the side sliding door whoever the driver was gunned it and got the fuck out. It was like they were running from robbing a bank. WTF?</p>

<p>Weird, huh? I told the police, and it seems I&#39;ve been ignored again. </p>

<p>My passport requests and continually denied but I have one other plan to escape the New United States.</p>

You could&#39;ve easily rushed to the window last Saturday, with the camera ready just in case, and caught some footage.</p>

<p>However the other user replying to you has a point, that you don&#39;t want to push anyone into a corner. Be careful</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you <em>absolutely</em> sure about all of this? Even if the answer is yes, if you have prescription medication you need to be taking you should really take them as soon as you read this comment. I&#39;m only saying this as someone who has no idea about your case or who you are, but what you&#39;re describing sounds alarmingly like my friends&#39; multiple psychosis episodes. If you have pills a doc has told you to take, take them just in case anyway even IF this is all happening as you say.</p>

<p>I know I sound like an asshole, but I hate seeing what some of these &quot;false alarm&quot; things can do to someone. By false alarms I mean, being <em>sure</em> someone is making a repetitive noise, firing guns and standing outside of your home yet it all being false simply by the fact of me actually being there with my friend to prove nothing is going on.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t be upset. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on but it just sounds like a psychotic episode and I feel extremely anxious because it reminds me of my friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude/dudette, please, take your medicine. I know I sound like an asshole, but I hate seeing people go through this. You know it&#39;s the same as always, you know it&#39;s psychosis. I&#39;m just a random guy online but I have three friends with bad schizophrenia and you are describing exactly what they always say despite me being with them and seeing nothing is going on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your own mind fucking with you, the sounds are actually your own stress manifesting as a real-seeming event. Take your medication NOW. Please. I&#39;m getting extremely anxious just by reading your comments because I get flashbacks to my friends&#39; psychotic breakdowns. One of them killed himself because he was so afraid of the &quot;gun shots&quot; and cops outside his window that were NEVER there.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re not crazy. Nobody&#39;s THAT crazy. You&#39;re just stressed out. Even IF it&#39;s all true, it&#39;s better to be fucked up on meds right? Think positive, no matter if I&#39;m wrong or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quickly:</p>

<p>I caught the nsa/cia trying turn me into a terrorist in Edmond, Oklahoma via medicine and social stimuli. </p>

<p>So I booked it to Montana, where the spooks continued to followed me, normally using children as human shields as they know I won&#39;t get dangerous around kids. (That&#39;s how sick these people are...)</p>

<p>They tried to kill me in a car crash in Montana, failed.</p>

<p>They tried to kill me in a car crash in South Dakota via a 120mph car chase, but failed.</p>

<p>They then talked to the cops that I talked to, and those cops put me in a loony bin for 5 days, but the docs said nothing was wrong with me and let me go. Ah, but now I have that on my record, and that&#39;s just what they want. See?</p>

<p>So my wife &quot;magically&quot; gets a job, 2x the pay from her last job, in VA $100k a year. So we move there. Just so happened that her new job is right next to CIA HQ.... literally the only other building next to CIA HQ... HOW WEIRD..... Things seem to die down and like two months later the mother fucking clickers start again, and I see nsa connections to my home network via Wireshark. What the fuck? Why keep bothering me?</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually all of my we traffic points to the cia application page but I&#39;m like &quot;nope&quot;. The pages even do certain... things.. so, yeah, job offer. Nope. They are monsters of humanity. Complete human filth. They&#39;ve cause my wife and I so much pain and hardships for so long, and that&#39;s just me, not to mentioned allllll of the uuuh crimes against humanity they&#39;ve committed? No thanks and a /both middle fingers in the air.</p>

<p>Ok. So they continue. They keep doing weird shit. My comps are hacked. Clicking all the time. Docs act funny as if others are talking to them about me... uuuhhh why, and my passport is denied all the time due to &quot;glitches&quot; and &quot;lost the application&quot;, bullshit.</p>

<p>The cia/nsa have destroyed my once kind of successful yet happy life. They are evil. They are the new Nazi SS and they are in control, I&#39;m so sorry. :\</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Followup questions:</p>

<p>If you&#39;re worried about being followed or doxxed, why post photos of your Nissan with license plate numbers in full view?</p>

<p>Some of your other comments are about how you intend to move or have moved? To VA in the last 8 months but are still claiming to be in OK? If you have been flagged by FBI, CIA, Interpool, etc you would not be allowed to move across state lines so easily which tells me you are a U.S. citizen.</p>

<p>If you are being denied a passport as a U.S. citizen, could it be that you are on probation or have a felony? This post seems to imply you have some sort of criminal record:</p>

<p>&quot;You ever put a knife to a mother fucker&#39;s neck?</p>

<p>You ever been chased at 120mph?</p>

<p>You ever chase a mother fucker and watch his dumb intel ass run over speed bumps while you avoid them owning his fucking ass in a car chase to kill only to lay off cause he goes to a public area and you don&#39;t want innocents to die?</p>

<p>You ever smash the fuck out of an $80k car then try to kill the driver while he runs his pansy ass away?</p>

<p>You ever stare two mother fucker&#39;s down who have guns on their persons, you a knife, and you know you&#39;ll kill both of them if they attempt to draw cause the dumb fucks were stupid enough to stay within arm&#39;s length?</p>

<p>You pack the shit on your 24/7 cause you don&#39;t know when these faggot bitch boys are going to come out of their cowardice to dance with a real mother fucker who came from the shit?</p>

<p>No, you haven&#39;t, so you do some shit like that, then you come back and tell me about which nation to move to.&quot;</p>

<p>Unless you got away with these crimes that you&#39;ve admitted to, in which case why post a confession on r/conspiracy on a profile that people can access full view of your license plates?</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re claiming to have done these things in some sort of movie style fight with LEOs, in which case are you a ghost? Because your ass would be dead by now!</p>

<p>Sounds like you need to head over to r/legal advice, if any of what you have to say is true, take down all incriminating evidence and stop making it so easy for people to track you down</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t care about being doxxed. I&#39;m armed at all times, and am willing to kill if put in physical danger or if there is an attempt to subdue me. At one point I just went /shrug and stopped caring about my real life and online personas, or whatever, and I&#39;m just me. Come at me bros, my life has turned to complete shit, and some guy wanting to  order some pizzas at my house, or w/e, isn&#39;t doing me much worse. </p>

<p>You should use quotes or others here are going to be vastly confused. Also, I may have been a wee bit drunk on some of those posts. ;p</p>

<p>You claim crimes, I claim self-defense. No, it&#39;s not really like the movies. It&#39;s far stupider. The fact that I&#39;m not a ghost is most likely why the cia then asked mr to apply to them... which is hilarious... like I would join the New Nazi SS and be a scum bag like those cia assholes. Never. </p>

<p>Heh, these folks tracking me down aren&#39;t using silly things like license plates in a photo, but thank you. I will check out legal advice and see.</p>

<p>You know, I fondly remember the time I learned of a deadman&#39;s switch/logic controller. It&#39;s so simple, and can effectively eve n a playing field when an innocent is for some absurd reason, against such vast odds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy/gal is seriously going through psychosis (schizophrenic episode), I suspect they already have medication and just forgot to take them exactly on time. It&#39;s not cool to make fun of psychosis, they already feel stupid and bullied enough.</p>

<p>It&#39;s characterized by hearing repeating loud clicks or gun shots, feeling and seeing people (often cops or authoritarian figures) standing outside of their home through the window, with bizarre thought patterns like weird purple monkey dishwashers spying on them. I know 3 people with schizophrenia and they ALL go through this once a year, and have tried to kill themselves FOR REAL (stabbing their arms so much they can never walk outside without long sleeves again, emptying multiple bottles of pills and barely making out alive after being given medical charcoal to neutralize the drugs).</p>

<p>They HONESTLY, 100% hear and see all of the stuff they say they are. Basically, there&#39;s a malfunction in their brain &#39;wiring&#39; that causes them to physically/neurologically be unable to tell whether or not something is actually real, or just something they were thinking about. They quite literally hear their inner voices as coming from the outside as real as a real person talking. It&#39;s scary as shit, and it even drives medical professionals to depression because it&#39;s so fucking disturbingly sad. I know two mental hospital workers (my brother and sister) who really can&#39;t cope with their schizophrenic patients despite forcing themselves for years on end, to the point where they need to use antidepressants and strong sleeping pills just to NOT think about the schizophrenic patients. It feels so real to them that it disturbs normal people to their core. Me included.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the horribly funny point. I&#39;m not sure. They called me a &quot;dangerous criminal mind&quot;... bleh... yeah so dangerous me coding for a living and playing video games OoOoOoO.... assholes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how anyone can help, but thank you. I think that this will end with my death, and for what? Why?</p>

<p>It sucks.</p>

<p>If you have any relatives in the Department of State to try to help me get my passport. See I keep applying, but they keep &quot;losing&quot; it, or &quot;a computer glitch&quot; see? Like, I get it, um, I guess, the US gov doesn&#39;t like my outspoken ways or something, but wants my brain for their evil plots, but no... soooo... why not just let me out of the nation? Why keep me prisoner? </p>
