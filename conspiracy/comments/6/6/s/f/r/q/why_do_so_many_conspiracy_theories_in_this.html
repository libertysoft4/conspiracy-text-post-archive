        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I lurk in this sub pretty regularly, &amp; I love that the things people post about make me think critically. However, I find that a lot of conspiracy theories posted here boil down to devil worship, &amp; I&#39;m wondering why that is? </p>

<p>Personally, I feel attributing an individual or group&#39;s motives to worshipping the devil seems .... religiously biased. People have historically committed atrocious acts in the name of many religions - ones that worship &quot;God&quot; &amp; ones that worship the &quot;Satan.&quot; What&#39;s the point of mentioning a religious affiliation?</p>

<p>When someone posts a wall of texts showing tons of evidence that supports a conspiracy, then closes it with &quot;See?? Tons of occult, satanic references!! Blood sacrifice!! Rituals!!&quot; it makes me question if there is some type of Christian agenda behind the post. </p>

<p>Is there some conspiracy theory handbook I missed highlighting the importance of religious affiliation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of them admit it. Some could be leading us astray. It does function as a catch-all term, sometimes incorrectly, but the historical constant seems to be the effort to divorce man from God (and make him his own god) as being &quot;the devil&#39;s work&quot;. Devil being that which is &quot;evil&quot;, God being that which is &quot;good&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;devil worship&quot; per se.  What I think going on is this:  the old forms of pagan worship as practiced by Greek and Roman aristocracy were extremely brutal, nothing like the neo-pagan alt-spiritualities today (naked hippies larping in the forest).  Aristocrats did brutal things because they worked (or seemed to).  These traditions got handed down throughout the centuries, and are still in practice today.  Christianity was just a religion imposed upon the masses to neuter them.  Aristocratic pretended to be Christians, while continuing the old pagan rites in secrecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you watch William Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon to gain an understanding behind the &#39;devil worship&#39; horseshit - what it really boils down to (or seems to boil down to) is that they worship &#39;intellect&#39; - there are many symbols for intellect, ie Satan, exclaiming to be the &#39;morning star&#39; - morning star -&gt; the sun -&gt; light -&gt; illumination -&gt; knowledge/intellect</p>

<p>The symbols and crazed worship keep the masses confused and misled who try to figure out the elite - the elite believe it is their duty to protect their intellectual advances over the masses by any means necessary, as eventually they will be able to become &#39;gods&#39; through the use of science, and create a utopia - science and intellect are the means to get there, and people who do not possess the same intellect are essentially just animals and may be slaughtered as the ends justify the means</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your welcome - i hope you find some truth.  The answer to challenging the system is fairly simple and pragmatic: apply yourself so you become intellectually competent, particularly in math and science so you can spur game-changing innovation that will benefit humankind; and learn to protect yourself - make it so you are worth more alive than dead, because by intellectually challenging the zero-growth model, you become an adversary.</p>

<p>Also, take a look at r/new_american_system
They are discussing new tech / super projects that will change the course of history if we can convince the people of their viability</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it extends beyond religion. </p>

<p>Religion is just a tool that tries to explain the reasons why something is right or wrong.</p>

<p>But, I believe we have an instinctual feeling in what we deem right or wrong. </p>

<p>Anything we deem &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; is going to be lumped into Satanic territory. </p>

<p>However, I also believe that the elite bloodlines have a knowledge of spiritual knowledge and have faith (just like anyone else) that &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; is &quot;right&quot;. </p>

<p>And their belief is centered around the fact that evil (thus far) has triumphed good on Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it satanic if they arent worshipping satan? If they are worshipping the things that help them like the sun and the earth because they are grateful for their uses? Seems like a label more than anything.

<blockquote>
<p>But back to the claims of Satanic activity. This is a common ploy used by the CIA and FBI, to lead investigators into dark alleys. Long ago I learned that anytime I am being led into Satanism, Crowley, LaVey, and similar channels, I should know that the CIA is trying to divert me. It isn&#39;t Satanists that are running these events, it is most often military intelligence. But the black agencies use Satanism to cover their tracks. For most researchers, Satanism is a sexier road than the road to G-men, and they willingly take it. Rule number one in researching false flag events: ignore all links that lead to Satanism. Those are sucker links, put there on purpose by the CIA writers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Miles Mathis is disinfo supreme. He&#39;s hit the bullseye a few times but he&#39;s also often wide of the mark--see his recent piece on Trump&#39;s stolen election, where according to MM he only got 10-15% of the actual vote. Or the faked JFK assassination. </p>

<p>His Stephen Hawking piece is for the ages, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to believe him but I haven&#39;t read even a quarter of his papers, as there are way too many. I don&#39;t particularly care what he thinks about American politics but what he said about satanism I believe hits the nail on the head. Satanism is the greatest artificial gatekeeper of all time. When most people run into satanism, that&#39;s where they stop and give up.</p>

<p>I also can&#39;t fault him for believing <em>anything</em> about the voting in our elections because truly- none of us know a fucking thing. He may as well be right about Trump only getting 10-15% of the vote because we don&#39;t know whether he did or not and polls can&#39;t be trusted. His JFK theory was fascinating.</p>

<p>There is no way Trump got 10-15% of the vote. It may have been stolen, but he certainly got at least 40%. The JFK theory is as nuts as it is fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a religious person, but to understand the reality we live in, you have to go into more esoteric, or spiritual terms. This is ancient knowledge, far older than any modern religion.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about our place in the universe and coming to terms with beings we don&#39;t yet fully comprehend, and a realty of many dimensions that interrelate.</p>

<p>The basis of all the major conspiracies, and the truth that has been hidden is that these things are real. Most people have problems with terminology because of learned belief systems.</p>

<p>The root of the &#39;hidden hand&#39;, the Cabal, the Illuminati, and all other names for it are groups that oppose the advancement of mankind to further their own purposes. They do not worship a &#39;devil&#39; named Satan. Satan is only a word meaning adversary... In the Abrahamic religions the hidden controllers have played both parts, light and dark. The Jesuits, Zionists, Islamists are playing the same game from different sides.</p>

<p>The true Divine nature of God is within ourselves. We are all creator-beings who are actually a part of God... Not an ET God, but the Source of ALL... The ones at the top know that all of the religions have been co-opted for their purposes long ago.</p>

<p>Satanic ritual abuse is servitude to beings which would be called Archons, demons or djinn, depending on the culture. They could also be called ET, but are not the same as more physical ETs like Draco Reptilians... Lucifer is real too, but is more like a plasma-based AI than a walking-talking being.</p>

<p>These are the things that should be talked about in this sub all the time because the story of humanity is more epic than anyone could imagine.</p>

<p>We have lost our memory, and great civilizations have risen and fallen many times. Both positive and negative ETs have been a part of Earths history since the beginning. The last few thousand years have been rough, and we are just now seeing the light on the other side. The global awakening is real.</p>

<p>Some people take it to the extreme because it feels good to be on the side of good, and also makes it possible to fight them without having to imagine them as people (and therefore have to try to understand, which takes empathy, which causes pain); easier to just dehumanize them as &quot;demons&quot; or whatever than it is to go &quot;what would happen in a person if they did what these people are purported to do?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find its easier to understand as &#39;positive and negative&#39; forces as opposed to &#39;God and satan&#39; but you&#39;re right, and actually I was pretty atheist until I started digging, but now I see how much evil or &#39;negativity&#39; there truly is, which can only mean there&#39;s an opposite positive force, which I believe is by design, for without the choice between the negative and positive, we would have no true free will, and neither would exist. But I actually feel that everything does go back to some luciferian shit that only the elite and their movers are privy to, and you literally have to &#39;sell your soul&#39; to them by doing some horrific shit you can never come back from ie child rape/sacrifice to ever get even close to their level.
