        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Earlier I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/66xivn/the_simpsons_sjws_at_yale/">posted</a> a clip from The Simpsons that criticizes Social Justice, cultural Marxism, and the climate of brainwashing on college campuses that benefits the establishment and I immediately was downvoted and attacked by people who&#39;ve never read Adorno, Marcuse, or are just completely in the dark when it comes to critical theory, philosophy, and where any of that fits into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the conspiracy?&quot; these people ask when they see a post <em>they</em> do not understand. <em>They</em> have a worldview limited only to what they know and because they don&#39;t understand they assume based on <em>their</em> perception that &quot;X&quot; has nothing to do with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This is why I, personally, never criticize other posts for being off topic because maybe I just don&#39;t see the connection based on <em>my</em> limited worldview. </p>

<p>It seems that people want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be a distraction from reality. They want to talk about the Jews, Mandela Effect, Flat Earth, Hollow Earth, aliens, lizard people, etc., but they don&#39;t want to seem to talk about anything substantive. They want to talk about exciting stuff, they don&#39;t want to talk about mechanisms of control, the nature of power, how the elite manufacture <em>real</em> divisions and manipulate the masses, and so on. </p>

<p>I really feel that this community could benefit from reading political theory and philosophy more. It seems a lot of people do not understand that cultural criticism, analyzing discourse, examining the genealogy of ideas, all of this is critical to understanding what is going on in our world today in regards to what this community is about. It seems that as deep as this community goes on the subject is either Marx is evil and socialism is evil, or Marx was great and socialism is great, but other than that no-one wants to examine where other philosophers and thinkers fit into understanding conspiracy theories and power and how power is exercised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism was the Frankfurt School&#39;s analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>, a term they had to come up with to think about. They were against the mass production and de-authentication of culture. To quote Adorno:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them.&quot; -Adorno</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a term for a certain kind of Cultural Analysis (against lazy mass produced culture), and has nothing to do with Identity Politics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics#History">which has its origins elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>[edit: Side note, The Frankfurt School &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot; were in fact <a href="http://field-journal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tumblr_inline_o1o1r1Dlz11qmjacb_1280-768x524.jpg">protested by feminists</a>, individuals within their lineage <a href="https://konspektikaust.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/nancy-fraser-rethinking-recognition/">argue against identity and recognition politics</a>, and members of The Frankfurt School have been some of the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#9">key critics of post modernism</a>]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware of the roots of identity politics, intersectionality, social justice, the Frankfurt School, etc. All of these ideas in the 21st century have become linked into one regressive ideology espoused by the New Left. </p>

<p>And I disagree that cultural Marxism has nothing to do with identity politics. Aside from the fact that many academic papers have been written on cultural Marxism and identity politics, just apply logic. Where does identity come from? Who propagates the ideas that develop identity? How do those ideas benefit those who have power? And how does all of this develop culture? How does the culture developed reinforce power? And so on. </p>

<p>And while it&#39;s all well and good that Habermas and others may have criticized post modernism, but liberal college professors with an agenda pick and choose what matters to them. This is how, as you pointed out, the Frankfurt School ended up being criticized by feminists, to being cited by feminists today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy above me did a fine job explaining cultural Marxism and providing links to sources.</p>

<p>Basically a bunch of guys at a research institute in Frankfurt, Germany created something called &quot;critical theory&quot; which took Marx&#39;s theories and applied them to social problems to understand the mechanisms that control us. It is a very dialectical way of looking at the world. </p>

<p>As for social justice, the problem is that it seeks equity, not equality. It seeks repayment for past grievances, real or imagined. In other words, it is divisive. It is not about building relationships, it is about flipping the roles of oppressor and oppressed. As the cartoon points out, they directly oppose true liberal ideas such as free speech, a marketplace of ideas, free markets, and so on.</p>

<p>George Carlin puts it better,</p>

<p><em>In an earlier book, Brain Droppings, I wrote some things about politically correct language, but left out a few areas. I neglected three important groups of people who have had this awkward, dishonest language inflicted on them by liberals: I omitted those who are crippled, ugly or stupid. And so, to address these earlier omissions, I’d like to make a brief return visit to that playground of guilty white liberals: political correctness.</em></p>

<p><em>Political correctness is America’s newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance. It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people’s language with strict codes and rigid rules. I’m not sure that’s the way to fight discrimination. I’m not sure silencing people or forcing them to alter their speech is the best method for solving problems that go much deeper than speech.</em></p>

<p><em>Therefore, those among you who are more politically sensitive than the rest of us may wish to take a moment here to tighten up those sphincter muscles, because I’m going to inject a little realism into the dream world of politically correct speech. Especially the words we use to describe one  another.</em></p>

<p><strong>CRIPPLED LIBERALS</strong></p>

<p><em>Perhaps you’ve noticed that when the politically correct, liberal rule-makers decide to rename a group of humans they view as victims, they begin by imparting a sense of shame to the group’s existing name. And so, somewhere over the years, the word cripple has been discarded. No one mentions cripples anymore. That’s because, in yet another stunning attempt to stand reality on its head, cripples have been assigned a new designation, the physically challenged. The use of physically challenged is an obvious attempt to make people feel better, the idea being, “As long as we can’t cure these people, lets give their condition a more positive name, and maybe it will distract everyone.” It’s verbal sleight of hand.</em></p>

<p><em>The same is true of the ungainly phrase differently abled. I believe that if a person is going to insist on using tortured language such as differently abled, then he should be forced to use it to describe everyone. We’re all differently abled. You can do things I can’t do, I can do things you can’t do. Barry Bonds can’t play the cello, Yo-Yo Ma can’t hit the curveball. They’re differently abled.</em></p>

<p><em>It should be explained to liberals patiently that crippled people don’t require some heroic designation: it’s a perfectly honorable condition. It appears in the Bible: “Jesus healed the cripples.” He didn’t engage in rehabilitative strategies to improve the conditions of the physically disadvantaged. Can’t these liberals hear how unattractive this language is? How poorly it sits on the ear? Personally, I prefer plain, descriptive language.</em></p>

<p><em>For instance and this is a suggestion that will bother some, but I’m serious about it why don’t we just call handicapped people defective? We don&#39;t mind talking about birth defects; we don’t flinch from that. We say, “Gunther has a birth defect.” Isn’t that a concession to the fact that people can be defective? Then what would be wrong with calling those people the physically defective? At what point in life does a person with a birth defect become a person who is differently abled? And why does it happen? I’m confused.</em></p>

<p><strong>UGLY LANGUAGE</strong></p>

<p><em>Then there are those who don’t quite measure up to society’s accepted standards of physical attractiveness. The worst of that group are called ugly. Or at least they used to be. The P.C. lingo cops have been working on this, too.</em></p>

<p><em>And to demonstrate how far all this politically correct, evasive language has gone, some psychologists are actually now referring to ugly people as “those with severe appearance deficits.” Okay? Severe appearance deficits. So tell me, psychologist, how well does that sort of language qualify for “being in denial”? These allegedly well-intentioned people have strayed so far from reality that it will not be a surprise for me to someday hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient.</em></p>

<p><em>Back to ugly. Regarding people’s appearance, the political-language police already have in place one comically distorted term: lookism. They say that when you judge a person, or rather, size them up (wouldn’t want to judge someone; that would be judgmental) if you take their looks into account, you’re guilty of lookism. You’re a lookist.</em></p>

<p><em>And those valiant people who fight lookism (many of them unattractive themselves) tell us that one problem is that in our society, those who get to be called beautiful and those who are called ugly are determined by standards arbitrarily set by us. Somehow, there is some fault attached to the idea that we, the people, are the ones who set the standards of beauty. Well, we’re the ones who have to look at one another, so why shouldn’t we be the ones who set the standards? I’m confused. I would say the whole thing was stupid, but that’s my next topic, and it would sound like a cheap transition.</em></p>

<p><strong>STUPID PEOPLE</strong></p>

<p><em>So, stupid. It’s important to face one thing about stupidity: We can’t get away from it. It’s all around us. It doesn’t take a team of professional investigators to discover that there are stupid people in the world. Their presence (and its effects) speaks for itself.</em></p>

<p><em>But where do these stupid people come from? Well, they come from American schools. But while they’re attending these schools, they’re never identified as stupid. That comes later, when they grow up. When they’re kids, you can’t call them stupid. Which may be contributing to the problem. Unfortunately, kids, stupid or otherwise, come under a sort of protective umbrella we’ve established that prevents them from being exposed to the real world until, at eighteen, their parents spring them on the rest of us, full grown.</em></p>

<p><em>There are stupid kids. And I do wish to be careful here how I negotiate the minefield of the learning disabled and the developmentally disadvantaged in other words, “those with special needs” (All of these being more examples of this tiresome and ridiculous language.) I just want to talk about kids who are stupid; not the ones with dings.</em></p>

<p><em>One of the terms now used to describe these stupid kids is minimally exceptional. Can you handle that? Minimally exceptional? Whatever happened to the old, reliable explanation, &quot;The boy is slow”? Was that so bad? Really? “The boy is slow. Some of the other children are quick; they think quickly. Not this boy. He’s slow.&quot; It seems humane enough to me. But no. He his minimally exceptional.</em></p>

<p><em>How would you like to be told that about your child? “He’s minimally exceptional.” “Oh, thank God for that! We thought he was just kind of, I don’t know, slow. But minimally exceptional! Wow! Wait’ll I tell our friends.”</em></p>

<p><em>Political correctness cripples discourse, creates ugly language and is generally stupid.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You never actually provide an argument. Anyone can do what you&#39;re doing:</p>

<p>&quot;Basically there was this guy called Hitler and a lot of his ideas ended up part of conservative ideology&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was this guy named Reagan and he came up with this thing called Reaganomics&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bill O&#39;Riley got fired&quot;</p>

<p>....it&#39;s post-hoc ergo propter hoc logic. Try linking the ideas you&#39;re trying to convey using direct evidence. Make it simple but obvious.</p>

<p>The problem is you&#39;re trying to say where other people&#39;s beliefs came from, and then declare ALL of those beliefs as out and out cancerous... </p>

<p>...but there&#39;s not going to be any evidence. No one is going to write at the end of their own paper &quot;by the way I got all these ideas from this guy&quot; - and todays politics are clearly different to all the previous generations.</p>

<p>By the way - I blame your great great great great great grandfather DIRECTLY for everything you say. Makes just about as much sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making an argument. It seems that&#39;s all you want to do. You, rather than seek to understand the point I was making, have been attempting to lecture me this entire time. Only the funny thing is you don&#39;t actually know what you are talking about. </p>

<p>The problem is you are trying to debate. You have a worldview, you are arguing in defense of it. Again, I don&#39;t really know why. The point of this thread was that philosophy and analysis can help people understand conspiracies and current events better. But you didn&#39;t want to have that discussion because you want to argue. </p>

<p>Frankly, it&#39;s exhausting talking to you so I&#39;m going to stop. I find it rather hard to really understand your frame of reference given the fact that I&#39;ve read so much on the subject, heard many lectures from college professors, be they my own, or professors streaming their lectures from Yale and other major universities, in addition to my own independent study on this very subject, and I&#39;ve never had any problems talking about cultural Marxism, identity politics, social justice, and the New Left, nor have I ever encountered anyone like you who acts as though all of this is unheard of. To me, it seems rather obvious how Adorno, Horkheimer, Benjamins writings would fit into identity politics, intersectionality, social justice, etc. It seemed rather obvious to my professor when I pitched the independent study on the subject. Doesn&#39;t seem obvious to you though.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not generalizing. You are generalizing based upon your anecdotal experiences. However, observation of the evidence shows that 90% of the posts on this sub deal with Flat Earth, lizard people, Jews., etc. There are many anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, Holocaust denial stories under new right now in addition to a ton of Flat Earth content. Scroll through the first few pages and count them all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>90% eh? A quick look at /new easily proves that incorrect. </p>

<p>I agree there&#39;s too much anti Jew stuff, but you&#39;re going to get that. Just report and move on, or better yet, block that user! That&#39;s easier than putting your big boy boots on and ignoring it!</p>

<p>You have no right to tell people not to post about lizards, flat earth etc. it just hurts your little feelings that some people don&#39;t care about the things you care about. </p>

<p>Lol yes, I&#39;m the one that&#39;s &#39;triggered&#39;, cos I&#39;m the one that made a whiney post complaining and exaggerating facets of this sub. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not perfect, and you want it to conform to your expectations. </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting a whiff of your over compensation for a lack of substance. The need to marginalize me as inferior, a child, compared to you, the adult. This fallacy highlights the weakness of the foundation on which you stand. </p>

<p>Again, you told me I am not a mod, I haven&#39;t a right to tell people what to do and say. That was your proposition.</p>

<p>The counter proposition is that you are being a hypocrite by doing the very thing you are accusing me of doing. Further, I was not in fact telling people what to do, but rather I was suggesting that people should instead learn a little bit about politics, philosophy, and media studies to gain a greater and more deeper understanding of the issues we discuss on this subreddit.</p>

<p>The issue here is that <em>you</em> do not see the relevance because <em>you</em> have a <em>very</em> limited view of the world reinforced by your arrogance and by your ego. Rather than acknowledge the argument laid out before you, you are too busy attempting to maintain your own cognitive consistency. Because what is important to you isn&#39;t learning, it&#39;s maintaining a belief a system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment highlights a problem I think many people have. I never said talking about the so-called Jewish conspiracy <em>wasn&#39;t</em> substantive. I simply said that it&#39;s not <em>all</em> there is. The point is that many on this subreddit seem to be clueless when it comes to critical theory, political philosophy, or philosophy in general, and yet they all have beliefs and ideas and theories about things. Case in point your comment. You immediately make it about Left/Right politics. Why? Where did you get that idea? Why is there a &quot;leftist&quot; conspiracy and a &quot;right wing&quot; conspiracy in your eyes? Why isn&#39;t there just <em>a</em> conspiracy? Look at the membership roster for the Council on Foreign Relations. You will find so-called liberals and conservatives. You will find spokesman for &quot;liberal&quot; news outlets and spokesman for &quot;conservative&quot; news outlets, and yet there they are, part of the same organization, pushing for the same agenda. Do you think they bicker over the rhetorical differences between their parties? Do you think they, in private, care about the Left/Right paradigm?</p>

<p>And if the &quot;Khazarian Mafia&quot; ruled the world, you wouldn&#39;t have the tumult you see going on right now. They <em>want</em> to rule the world. They very nearly do. Within a few decades, they will. </p>

<p>Because those two &quot;sides&quot; have been flooding this sub with their agendas, and some of us people recognize it for what it is. The problem is we are the minority. The masses eat this stuff up here. It&#39;s a place to post/discuss those agendas at a low level, without much pushback, making good use of the open nature of the sub itself.

    <div class="md"><p>Uh. Don&#39;t blame me for your poor reading skills, friend. The point of the post was that people on this thread should read philosophy and political theory, not <em>just</em> spend their days absorbed in Jews and lizard people. You&#39;ve proven the point I was making. You&#39;re all way too standoffish, quick to leap to assumptions and fight over positions you don&#39;t <em>need</em> to take. There&#39;s no reason to argue, arguments have winners or losers. We&#39;re not trying to <em>win</em>, we&#39;re trying to find Truth.</p>

<h2><strong>Good day</strong>.</h2>

<p>My reading skills are not the problem, the problem is you lumping worthwhile topics into fringe topics.</p>

<p>Are you a pro-Israel Zionist or just acting like one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you eli5 what Cultural Marxism means ? You throw the term around a lot and I think it would be helpful it you clarify it. And can you eli5 what is so bad about the &quot;social justice movement&quot; you speak so negatively of? I thought it was about pushing for the rights of  oppressed peoples like women and sexual minorities.  what do you consider so threatening about these concepts? </p>

<p>Aside from the fact that many academic papers have been written on cultural Marxism and identity politics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go on then...</p>

<p>The papers I&#39;ve seen use Cultural Marxism to mean 1 of 3 things:</p>

<p>The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry.</a> (ie. How capitalism effects human values)
The Birmingham School&#39;s interest in working class culture.
E.P Thompson is very rarely referenced (there&#39;s maybe 1 paper).</p>
