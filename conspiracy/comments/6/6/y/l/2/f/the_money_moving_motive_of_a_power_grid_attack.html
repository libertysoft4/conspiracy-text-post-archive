    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s done through property sales and donations. This is why brexit passed. Look at unaoil and the Panama papers.... They use property as capital that they later retake and sell for actual cash. The money is hidden in evaluation. Donald Trump did this in the 90s while conspiring with Bill Clinton and the community reinvestment act of 94 or 96. They give predatory loans out to people and force them to fail by devaluing their property holdings to bring the price down around them. So they give a 200k loan to Joe. They then have their own property valued at 600k revalued at 100k. That 200k property is now worth 20k so that the person who took the loan can&#39;t sell their property to get out of debt. They then offer a fraction and get the property. They take a loan like the weapon sale and wait a while. They wait a while then revalue everything at the original value plus x% to cover the weapons sale. Everyone breaks even, the rich get the property, the terrorist get the weapons and the American property owner loses everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is a link. It shows how bribes were laundered through London property and middle Eastern governments for oil contracts. I think that what happens is they use property in an account the government sets up between to false groups. The Federal reserve and the ACH treat it as that. They take a &quot;loan&quot; out on the false company, which would be the person buying the weapons giving the money to the false real estate company. This is then deposited into the false real estate companies account. They then sell the property to a friend with real accounts in other odfi so the false companies money is washed, the transaction happened as a property sale. I am doing this on top of my head, but I&#39;ve been exploring this since I read about unaoil, Miami real estate, and the Panama papers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top 1% is so small that it is all an intraconnected sham. They all bleed together at the expense of everyone. Politicians just take turns protecting the system so the elites children&#39;s can funnel into wealth and power. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really interesting to look at the community reinvestment act, Donald Trump, the Clinton&#39;s, New York tycoons, 9/11 and the 2008 collapse. In 2008- 2010 Trump went from a mega millionaire to a mega billionaire. It&#39;s funny people want Trump&#39;s taxes from last year when they should be asking for his financial history 1994-2012. It&#39;s why I laugh when people say Trump will take out Hillary. Hillary and William made Trump his fortune. That&#39;s why the WTC needed to be brought down because it was used as the building to backbone finance for technology and illegal foreign market manipulation. The insurance eats the cost, but the money was never real in the first place. </p>

<p>Brexit is the best evidence that it was going to happen in the UK but they absolved to not let the EU and others know the trick. The UK real estate market would of collapsed if they didn&#39;t exit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ww2 was because the big 3 we&#39;re losing to Germany and Russia in finance due to industrialization and socialism. After ww1 the Germans studied and beat the manipulators at their own game and people like Henry Ford, Rockefeller, Carnage, and Prescott Bush saw it was a safer system for not having to pay so much to the old religious controlled banks, Jewish Catholic and Islamic. So they played both sides and eventually the religious banks stuck a deal with America. This led to the cold war bc Russia was screwed over by the churches. The richest family in France had been the richest since like 1300. Same in England, judea, Switzerland, America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the link regarding the FDI in Iraq - </p>

<p>In December 2010, the GOI approved implementing regulations to this amendment, in the form of a Prime Ministerial decree. The regulations allow investors to obtain land for residential housing projects with no initial down payment. The government instead is compensated by receiving a specified percentage of units built once the project is completed. The percentages are given in ranges that vary by location: urban center, provincial center, outside city limits, and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p> An amendment to the NIL, passed in early 2010, allows for limited foreign ownership of land, albeit solely for the purpose of developing residential real estate projects. The amendment also sought to bring clarity to land allocation and use, a major barrier to attracting foreign investment. In December 2010, the GOI approved implementing regulations to the Amendment that are intended to specify the conditions not only for ownership of land for housing but also for long-term leasing of land for other types of investment projects. As of early 2013, Iraqi authorities were still in the process of interpreting these regulations and applying them to specific licensees. Many licensed investment projects remain stalled due to continuing confusion over land use at both the provincial and national levels.</p>

<p>The holdings accounts would be the accounts that sit until land titling and finance clears. Given the land will exist, the money doesn&#39;t have to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is regarding the FDI link someone gave me last night. This is in the relationship to the Kurds in Iraq.</p>

<p>Since passing its own Kurdistan Oil and Gas Law of 2007, the KRG has directly signed about 50 contracts to develop IKR energy reserves. The federal government has disputed the legal authority of the KRG to conclude most of these contracts, some of which are also in areas with unresolved administrative boundaries in dispute between the federal and regional government. Political blocs within the federal government have been unable to agree on comprehensive hydrocarbons legislation to address these issues. It is the position of the USG that signing contracts for oil exploration or production with any region of Iraq, without approval from federal Iraqi authorities, exposes companies to potential legal and financial risks.</p>
