<p>Say you&#39;re one of these people, and all of these theories are true, are you doing all of this just to sit there and get richer/more powerful, or do you guys think there&#39;s a different goal in sight not just for the Rothschilds, but anyone that&#39;s a part of TPTB?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah exactly. I always revert back to basic human psychology. No one would patiently wait If they could get away with it.</p>

<p>Quite honestly even though the argument on here will be everyone&#39;s sold out I think the east is quietly playing both sides and is waiting for the US to make a mistake and then punish them. But again that&#39;s only a guess</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird man. The Jews are very strong in the world tight now. I guess to pretend that a messiah has returned and everyone worship him under one government. Even that though again through logic they&#39;ll be tons of in fighting amongst the ranks for that top spot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, all those conspiracies are actually somewhat of a smoke screen/cover for what is really possibly going on. I&#39;ve traveled down many rabbit holes, and this is truly a spiritual endgame for them.</p>

<p>The true cabal (if you know there names, they are most likely nowhere near the top - think Rothschild, Rockefeller, etc etc) are not who you think they are. I believe they are ancient beings and a part of the surviving priest class of the Deluge (good and bad survived), and one can say the ones who caused the Deluge (think CERN - but more exotic).</p>

<p>They use and possibly posses the people that so many conspiracy theorist talk about. They cast no shadows, for where they are, there is no light. That priest class wants to enslaved us not only physical on Earth, but spiritually in the Universe. Rob us of our Spirit being, force us to comeback with having learned to ascend in the Universe. Why do they need this? No idea, maybe it gives them power, but, I believe this is their true end game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Great Deluge, the wave that reset humankind back to primitives. I believe in Antediluvian civilization, just not in the &quot;biblical&quot; sense. Now, it didn&#39;t reset all, some of the priest class from before survived and ruled over the primitive people. That is why all of a sudden civilization just came out of nowhere. Those people are knew how to build structures and rule people. Think Sumeria, Babylon, Mesopotamia, and Egypt and that&#39;s just in the &quot;Middle East&quot;. All over the world they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elite were never part of such a priest class and completely lost sight of true spirituality, but they indeed were part of Atlantis (which is the place the Deluge concerns) and did indeed cause such Deluge (which means the destruction of Atlantis).</p>

<p>They are not ancient beings, however, as all technology and knowledge of having incredibly long life spans was lost shortly after the destruction of Atlantis. It would have taken perhaps a couple thousand years, but by the half-way point between the destruction of Atlantis and 0 AD, it was certainly all gone and the memory of it would have truly started to fade into legend, and eventually myth, and then forgotten entirely by many peoples around the world.</p>

<p>The original elite that rose to power in Atlantis and caused its destruction lost sight of true spirituality before Atlantis was destroyed, and in truth, that is what would have caused them to do the things that lead to the destruction of Atlantis in the first place.</p>

<p>The elite are not spiritual beings and have no knowledge of true spirituality whatsoever. They are the ones who have created the majority of the world&#39;s religions, and indeed the &quot;New Age&quot; religion (which passes itself off as spirituality) was so very influenced by them that it was almost essentially created by them as well. Concepts like oneness, ascension, archangels, chakras, etc. are all completely false aspects of this religion, many of which come from other religions such as Christianity and Hinduism, both of which the elite also completely created. </p>

<p>This &quot;New Age&quot; religion is so enticing to people who question the narrative of the elite because it contains so much hope and false positivity, and it also includes completely real things <strong>like</strong> Atlantis, advanced et&#39;s, sacred geometry, crystals being important, etc. But this religion is easily the most harmful religion on the entire planet <em>because</em> it contains so many real things in it. It fills people with absolutely insane beliefs such as oneness (which I have made multiple posts about) and being &quot;starseeds&quot; (alien souls in human bodies), both of which completely dehumanize people and devalue them entirely.</p>

<p>This religion, along with the obsession with Satanism, is easily one of the most common ones among people who claim to be &quot;awake&quot; and who question the narrative of the elite. </p>

<p>This religion, the &quot;New Age&quot; religion, is something that cannot exist here and will be continually exposed for what it is: A set of beliefs.</p>

<p>Beliefs, no matter what they concern or where they come from, will always heavily influence people to react entirely negatively when actual objectivity is presented to them, as has happened many times lately. Beliefs cause people to lack patience and cause people to trust the established &quot;authority&quot; figures who propagate these beliefs, such as politicians, &quot;scientists&quot;, religious figures (including the ones in the &quot;New Age&quot; religion, be they &quot;channellers&quot;, gurus, &quot;shamans&quot;, etc.), teachers, <em>authors</em> (i.e. Graham Hancock), and of course, the elite. </p>

<p>This lack of patience and the total trust in established &quot;authority&quot; figures influences people so heavily to simply ignore large bodies of text that come from anyone besides these established &quot;authority&quot; figures that they will almost always choose to do so on their own free will, even when their choice to do so, and them making the choice and being able to make choices, is exposed in front of them multiple times. </p>

<p>Those 2 things come from beliefs, and will cause so very many of you to not read everything I have written here. They cause so very many people all across this sub to not read everything that I write. So very many people on this sub demand &quot;proof&quot;, which to them is what the established &quot;authority&quot; figures say is &quot;evidence&quot;, and these people often demand the proof in the form of links <em>to these very same established &quot;authority&quot; figures</em>. Beliefs influence people so immensely heavily to not actually think for themselves and use their mental faculties that they essentially never actually do, including so very many people on this sub. There seems to be thinking for oneself, but it is always attached to beliefs and always leads to more beliefs, and this always culminates in so very many people putting total trust in established &quot;authority&quot; figures such as Graham Hancock, David Icke, David Wilcock, and so many more without every actually looking at all of the obvious evidence, making all of the connections needed for themselves, and using logic to order these connections in the correct sequence to find the actual objective truth. </p>

<p>Graham Hancock is on the right path, there was an advanced ancient civilization that built the pyramids and megalith structures around the world. Yes it is over 10,000 years old and yes there was a flood that destroyed it. But the proverbial buck stops there and from that point on he becomes filled with conjecture - which are conlusions formed from incomplete and inaccurate information - and he then publishes his conjecture as if it were the secret &quot;truth&quot; because he has the &quot;evidence&quot; to support his conjecture. Evidence can only ever be considered evidence if <strong>everyone</strong> can see it with their own eyes, and there are multiple reasons for this which I will not go into in this thread. Evidence needs to be <em>obvious</em> evidence, and there <em>is</em> obvious evidence of Atlantis&#39;s existence everywhere in the world. </p>

<p>Atlantis was so absolutely real, yet it was not destroyed by a comet or a meteor. There could never have been a comet or a meteor that would have been allowed to hit the planet and destroy literal paradise on earth. But your beliefs would have you totally trust that Graham Hancock is completely correct and your lack of patience would influence you so very heavily to not actually read everything that I have written and will link, that you would simply dismiss what I have written and <strong><em>would not actually think for yourself</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Your beliefs would essentially cause you to remain willingly &quot;<strong><em>asleep</em></strong>&quot; to the actual objective truth, yet they would also essentially cause you to continuously claim that you are one of the few who are &quot;awake&quot;. Your beliefs are not things you can hold on to if you are to actually &quot;wake up&quot;. Your beliefs need to be completely destroyed, totally annihilated, utterly obliterated, if you are to ever &quot;wake up&quot;.</p>

<p>And that all starts with you, the reader, actually <strong><em>choosing</em></strong> to read everything and <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> dismiss it because you would rather cling to your lack of patience and total trust in established &quot;authority&quot; figures instead. </p>

<p><strong><em>YOU HAVE THE POWER OF CHOICE</em></strong> and that means you can choose, entirely on your own independent of anything else, to continue to willingly remain &quot;asleep&quot;, or to willingly &quot;wake up&quot;, and nothing you <em>believe</em> can ever change the simple truth that you can choose to do either of these things. </p>

<p>You are not a computer, you do not follow algorithms. You have the power of choice and you have the power of thought independent of anything else, so you are not bound by beliefs.</p>

<p>Pure positivity is returning to this planet, and trying to stop its return will never work and will only ever backfire tremendously. Pure positivty is not negative in any way, and to associate negativity with pure positivity creates such an immense backlash entirely towards you that you very, very, very, very, <em>very</em> simply will not enjoy.</p>

<p>So choose to read everything I have written and will link and do not allow your lack of patience and total trust in established &quot;authority&quot; figures to dictate your actions, and to further extend that: do not allow your <strong><em>beliefs</em></strong> to dictate your actions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">This</a> is my original thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/paramount importance to defeating the elite and their global control system,  well as how advanced Atlantis was, and why and how it was so advanced, and the thread continues in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ph62z/is_there_a_lost_city_under_antarctica/dcsf1xr/">This</a> comment goes into Antarctica and simply clarifies why it wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t be Atlantis, and piggy backs off of these other links. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pf4ep/there_is_a_hidden_knowledge_that_has_been_kept/dcr0nde/">This</a> comment goes into evidence and the insanity of using subjectivity and beliefs to determine reality. Finally, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveaxm/">this</a> comment is seemingly unrelated (its about music and the elite), but it goes into detail about God, and why negativity exists, and true spirituality, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveq1h/">this</a> comment continues that first one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to think globalization is good if there was no ruling class and we all just kinda agreed on the same thing. I fear this is not the case or end goal as it stands to reason.</p>

<p>The hidden agenda could be satanic in origin, it could link back to all big religions in some way being taught false knowledge and the like. Or it could all be relative to ones own experience. I&#39;d like to think we don&#39;t as a species have a grasp on what God is or can be when considering the vastness of the universe and just how insignificant we could be on that large of a scale.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason TPTB appear so evil is due in large part to an overall human desire for greed. This could relate to religion and secret societies, or there could be an agreement amongst those at the top that by any means necessary total control must be obtained. It could be a power struggle for all we know. Or a psyop. Or just plain nonsense and our imagination has gotten the best of us.</p>

<p>What do you think the end goal is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty optimistic and think the end goal would be to reduce the population (drastically), to make humans leave earth, and to survive.  I don&#39;t see any better end goal, but from what&#39;s going on today idk if the cabal even wants humans to survive; at this rate we&#39;ll be gone and our planet will be uninhabitable in a few hundred years.  But it doesn&#39;t make any sense why TPTB would want humans gone, and if they did why they wouldn&#39;t just nuke the whole planet right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird man. The Jews are very strong in the world tight now. I guess to pretend that a messiah has returned and everyone worship him under one government. Even that though again through logic they&#39;ll be tons of in fighting amongst the ranks for that top spot. </p>
