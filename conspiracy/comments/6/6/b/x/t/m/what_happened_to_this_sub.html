    <div class="md"><p>Hi, <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">/u/JamesColesPardon</a> </p>

<p>I think we have had a few crossings in discussions on this sub. I kind of feel like this sub has moved from a <strong>discussion</strong> sub to an <strong>accusation</strong> sub. Basically who can scream the loudest to get their point across instead of discussing different/alternate theorys. I don&#39;t know if a remedy is required. But it&#39;s how this sub&#39;s direction is heading. Which for people (like me) who have been here a long time, it&#39;s frustrating to watch. Do you feel the same? or am I talking crazy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope I feel the same way.</p>

<p>What I see here is a bit of a microcosm of things on the site as a whole. Various easily identifiable (and defeatable) talking points from separate camps/tribes of users who vary in degree of professionally for their ability to slide a forum.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly frustrating to watch, but there is hope and do feel were moving in the right direction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had faith in the mods here for a long time, even after giving up all faith in the &quot;top sub&quot; reddit mods a year ago. But I honestly don&#39;t know how this can slide back to how it was. I don&#39;t think this sub needs to update harsher rules around discussion. The sidebar states&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a forum for free thinking and <strong>discussing</strong> issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highlighted the most important part which I feel is the last thing happening on this thread currently. I don&#39;t know if it can be fixed but it&#39;s fucking sad to see it disappear, since it has been the biggest thing going for this sub for so long. </p>

The only thing I could possibly see helping, is encouraging discussion vs shut down. But I don&#39;t think that is something the mods should own. That should be the core subscribers as a whole. Sorry I to come off as placing blame on the Mods or insinuating the mods didn&#39;t do their job. I don&#39;t believe that to be the case. </p>

<p>Where? I don&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>And if you can&#39;t take the heat, you best get out the kitchen.</p>

<p>Why? Why can&#39;t we talk about real shit here? Why does it all have to be directed away from the current administration? </p>

<p>Who said this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not saying it&#39;s you, or the mods, but it&#39;s pretty clear there are people here defending the gov and trying to crush anything negative about Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there&#39;s people here doing just the opposite. Such is the balance here on the board. People are free to any political opinion they fancy here. Unlike other subs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why?</p>

<p>EDIT: There are multiple people in this very thread attacking the OP, and saying we shouldn&#39;t be talking about Trump/Russia because it&#39;s something the MSM is talking about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, not what they are saying. Do you deliberately twist things to fit your interpretation of your reality?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember when this sub promoted the MSM stories that backed up their theories. Sad. </p>

<p>Do you &#39;member? Because I don&#39;t  &#39;member MSM theories promoted here almost ever.</p>

Reagan was a Goldwater Republican (similar to Ron Paul&#39;s ideas), and to get elected, Reagan sold out to the neocons. Once elected, he told them to go to Hell, so they had him shot. He survived, and became a different man!!</p>
