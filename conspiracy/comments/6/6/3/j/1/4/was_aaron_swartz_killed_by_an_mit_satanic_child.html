        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">197</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/hotdogsfromchicago.html">hotdogsfromchicago</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This theory suggests that Aaron Swartz was murdered because he caught onto a secret pedophilia network at MIT. The story about how he stole documents from JSTOR was a coverup. The One Laptop Per Child program, through the MIT Media Lab, was setting up kids to be spied on by predators from a satellite link.</p>

<p>It might sound wild and crazy at first, and the website (disclose.tv) has some articles that are really &quot;out there&quot;, but this author makes a rather compelling argument and puts some decent research behind it.</p>

<p>Start here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The MIT cyber-pimps cater to a clientele that includes the highest echelon of the State Department, major corporations, intelligence agencies, the military brass, and the White House.</p>

<p>Every element in the Swartz case indicates that he died in a heroic attempt to expose the perversion that has corrupted the hearts and minds of the global elite, a heinous and often murderous vice that traumatizes innocent children and threatens every family on this planet.</p>

<p>The videotape of Swartz’s download led to the MIT complaint that spurred a federal prosecutor in Boston to indict him for pirating online journals distributed by JSTOR, a subscription-based electronic archive of scholarly papers. The charges are patently absurd.</p>

<p>Why would a so-called notorious hacker bother with redistributing journal articles that can be purchased at nominal cost or gained for free by students with a department account?</p>

<p>Unlike the Wikileaks trove of diplomatic cables, none of the papers are classified or contain state secrets.</p>

<p>Why didn’t he simply hack into the main JSTOR archive, whose files are accessible in bulk online from dozens of universities?</p>

<p>Swartz was a research fellow with the Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard, which also has an institutional account with JSTOR. Given his street cred and past associations, he could have easily found a webmaster with the password to the JSTOR server.</p>

<p>How can MIT, which is not the owner of the allegedly accessed material, file theft charges against him?</p>

<p>The JSTOR archive is not owned or based at MIT, as media reports suggest, but is registered at the Network Connections server farm in Herndon, Maryland. JSTOR is under the control of a nonprofit organization called ITHAKA, whose board of directors includes top university administrators and the W.W. Norton book publisher. The trespass (into a tiny closet) was done at MIT, but ITHAKA, the party with proprietary rights over the JSTOR intellectual property, does not appear as the chief plaintiff. (Analogy: Whenever a car is stolen from a parking lot, the car owner and not the car hop is supposed to file charges against the thief.)</p>

<p>MIT obviously has something to hide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Quite amazing and in reddit the night of his passing, the days that followed, we were reading even more of these connections. For so many out in the internet and in here, the grief, shock and outrage was openly expressed. </p>

<p>Granted, I knew very little about him from all the tech side but following his arrest etc. my learning curve was enhanced by so many that were touched by him in so many areas - it was really tough on these good people.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted this article by Yoichi Shimatsu a number of times in hopes that his voice would stay vibrant in seeking Legal Justice for Aaron Swartz, for the family. </p>

<p><em>On a side note</em>:</p>

<p>There were a number of odd campus suicides that popped up afterwards and of course the authorities lumped them as Hysteria related...I lost all that stuff on a lap top crash and have never been able to find the links again. Many researchers thought these were kids/students/people that were helping Aaron to expose the filth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, well, well.</p>

<p>MIT was trying to block release of the evidence to the public, stating they didn&#39;t want the names of people getting out who assisted in catching and prosecuting him because they would take flak from the public, also fearing flaws in the MIT network would be exposed.</p>

<p><em>What</em> were they trying to hide?</p>

<p>Then secret service took on the case.</p>

<p>MIT eventually released some documents from the case and there are some names of prosecutors and secret service agents that appear in them:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one:</p>

<p>He was head of Hillary Clinton&#39;s security detail during Bill Clinton&#39;s presidency. He also coordinated the USSS response to the 2013 Boston Marathon bomb investigation. Seen and handled a conspiracy or two that&#39;s for sure. Interesting.</p>

<p>Digging deeper, I find Aaron Swartz&#39; romantic lover Quinn wrote an article about being summoned to court, getting involved with secret service agent Steve and his detail:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/life-inside-the-aaron-swartz-investigation/273654/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/life-inside-the-aaron-swartz-investigation/273654/</a></p>

<p>They were questioning her hard core about any communications she had with Aaron and seemed to be trying to fish out of her something she &quot;might know&quot;. What they believed she knew is anyone&#39;s guess. Maybe they were bluffing for sake of discovery, or they knew Aaron was after something unrelated to JSTOR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I went back to find these <em>original</em> articles/reports (a couple years ago) I couldn&#39;t find them. It seems one was a young guy in California, another that I recall was a young female in or near MIT (?) There was discussion of <em>tech raid</em> on house with very dark (want to say it was dirt...?) tree covered driveway. I was working long hours, stressful stuff in my own life so I&#39;m fuzzy this far out. But all the discussion I read about was <em>exclusive</em> to reddit and <em>sources</em> linked into reddit.</p>

<p>Not trying to <em>hype</em> the event - the stuff is what I recall folks in here talking about as it was unfolding and I cannot say that it was indeed <em>connected</em> in the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How deeply involved do you think someone like Trump might be in a global pedophile ring? He is the very definition of the global elite that had a long history of involvement in Hollywood and politics.</p>

<p>He was friends with and even defended by pedophiles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump?</p>

<p>A. What do you mean by &quot;personal relationship,&quot; sir?</p>

<p>Q. Have you socialized with him?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. Yes?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?</p>

<p>A: Though I&#39;d like to answer that question, at least today I&#39;m going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir.</p>

<p>His words describing Epstein are very similar to his words about alleged sexual abuser Bill O&#39;Reilly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

<p>He has made sexual comments about his own daughters starting from when they were just babies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Well, I think that she&#39;s got a lot of Marla. She&#39;s a really beautiful baby, and she&#39;s got Marla&#39;s legs.&quot; Trump then motions to his chest, &quot;We don&#39;t know whether she&#39;s got this part yet, but time will tell.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked what he has most in common with Ivanka he said &quot;Well, I was going to say sex, but I can&#39;t relate that the her...&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://donaldandivanka.exposed/videos.html">http://donaldandivanka.exposed/videos.html</a></p>

<p>He was accused of violent rape by his ex wife when she was under oath. She only claimed she lied under oath several years later after various private meetings with many of his attorneys. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-ivana-trump-divorce-papers-battle-lawsuit-rape-allegation-marriage-settlement-private-a7294071.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-ivana-trump-divorce-papers-battle-lawsuit-rape-allegation-marriage-settlement-private-a7294071.html</a></p>

<p>His attorney, who is still close to him even went as far as to claim that a man can&#39;t legally rape his wife.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/27/ex-wife-donald-trump-made-feel-violated-during-sex.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/27/ex-wife-donald-trump-made-feel-violated-during-sex.html</a></p>

<p>And let&#39;s not forget the dozens of times he has been accused of sexual assault. Not even counting the girl who claimed he raped her when she was 13. He himself has claimed that when you&#39;re rich and powerful women will just let you sexually assault them. </p>

<p>Sounds like the pizzagate posterboy. </p>

<p>Sure, but I&#39;ve seen so little evidence of this actually happening.  Hell, someone of the people making those accusations don&#39;t really understand what the differences in Satanism and LaVeyan Satanism.</p>

<p>That there&#39;s little evidence of actual &quot;Devil Worship&quot; in many of the incidents attributed to it and I worry that it&#39;s not just a moral panic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. There are several reports / testimonies of Satanic rituals in these human trafficking rings. It&#39;s not just pedophilia. They sacrifice people, i.e. they kill them.</p>

<p>But testimonies are just testimonies, so I can&#39;t prove it without a doubt if they&#39;re Satanists or not. Honestly, they sound close enough to not even matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I only skimmed this article I didn&#39;t see anything about Satanism in it. Seems like it was added for clickbait title.</p>

<p>For me all stories of Satanic ritual abuse get auto an dismissal because there is no evidence at all that Satanic ritual abuse exists. Just say child porn ring, that&#39;s all that matters, religious beliefs of sex offenders are not relevant. </p>

<p>These people are mostly Jesus freaks so the Satanic angle appeals to them. I pretty much have every occult book in torrent form, have yet to find anything in any of those books to suggest child sexual abuse is part of any ritual. I already know the response to this is going to be the &quot;elite&quot; luciferian pedos don&#39;t use occult texts that you can download in a torrent. They have super secret books. Yeah right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole idea about clinical depression could be fabricated as well. I&#39;ve read something his brother, I think, said - they were discussing the act of suicide back in the time, Aarons point of view was that such a move doesn&#39;t get things done and he thought that&#39;s not the solution to any problem. Also, the day before his suicide he went out with his girlfriend and according to her statement, there were no signs of strange behavior. And yeah, she also said that he might be pretending b/c he wanted to do something nice for her one last time. The next day she found him hanging in the same clothes and coat he wore yesterday. Anyway, it&#39;s pointless arguing now...</p>

<p>That was the first thing he tried. He wrote a Python script to automate the download process, but JSTOR has ~5 million articles, and there are limits to what a script can do. He did manage to download quite a few articles that way, but was eventually blocked.</p>

<p>In light of the expert’s disclosures — which suggest that Swartz did have “authorization” to obtain the articles, due to the structure of MIT’s network and the various JSTOR agreements — it seems that the prosecution was even weaker than it appeared on the surface. An AP article notes that JSTOR’s attorney, Mary Jo White, the former top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, had called Stephen Heymann, the lead Assistant U.S. Attorney on the case, to ask him to drop the prosecution; instead, the U.S. Attorney’s office continued to demand Swartz plead guilty to all charges. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why would a so-called notorious hacker bother with redistributing journal articles that can be purchased at nominal cost or gained for free by students with a department account?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because he lived most of his adult life supporting the idea that free access to information is a key way to push humanity forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the Wikileaks trove of diplomatic cables, none of the papers are classified or contain state secrets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He had previously done analysis of large quantities of data to find incriminating patterns. Could&#39;ve been planning on analysing the documents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why didn’t he simply hack into the main JSTOR archive, whose files are accessible in bulk online from dozens of universities?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what he did from MIT. He was accessing the JSTOR archive from MIT using their free access. They started rate limiting his access, which he bypassed, which caused things to escalate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can MIT, which is not the owner of the allegedly accessed material, file theft charges against him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t. The government filed charges against him. MIT just took a neutral stance.</p>

<p>Seems like this whole theory is based on a lot of misinformation and a lot of assumptions. I don&#39;t buy it. Makes a lot more sense that the govt wanted to make an example out of him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire site was open access. People had already seen everything on the site, just no one person had seen everything.</p>

<p>Basically there was a digital library that only allowed knowledge to those that were members of elite and wealthy universities. All the knowledge was created for free and freely available, it was just behind walls. Aaron went behind the walls and scanned the documents, planning to recreate the library, but without walls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The login to JSTOR is the same for everyone, he doesn&#39;t suddenly get extra special access because he uses a scraper. If anything he gets less (depending on how the scraper is coded), but I&#39;m guessing Aaron knew what ht was doing.</p>

<p>Also the legal documents make reference to a second version of his script, as also mentioned in the Github repo for his first script.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but scraping would be for things that are publicly accessible or that he had a password for (a password giving him the same access as all others with JSTOR accounts.) If he was scraping extra info, he would need to hack access first. No one has ever suggested that hed did that.</p>

<p>Since then others haeve used his script, and no one has found anything hidden. These are simply journal articles behind a paywall.</p>
