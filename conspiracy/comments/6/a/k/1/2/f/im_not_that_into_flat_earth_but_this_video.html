<p>But no, this is wrong, once its set past the horizon its out of view, a telescope wouldnt see the sun again it would let you see the horizon &#39;closer&#39; but the sun is hidden behind it. If you moved your actual eyes closer you&#39;d see the sun, chase it, chase the sunset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video actually proves the earth is not flat, barring any camera trickery/exposure issues already mentioned. </p>

<p>As the Earth turns, and the sun &#39;comes up&#39;, the light from the sun travels to and (more importantly for this video) around the earth. The horizon is bright, but the light doesn&#39;t bend (enough anyway) to wash over the rest of the planet. </p>

<p>Shine a flashlight over a ball or sphere, you&#39;ll see the light illuminate parts of the ball the light doesn&#39;t directly shine on. You could quite literally pinpoint a location on your ball where you could stand and see the light coming but still be in darkness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It works in the sense that it explains the locations of the planetary bodies as we could measure them in 150AD. </p>

<p>It obviously doesn&#39;t &#39;work&#39; in the sense that it could actually be happening. </p>

<p>I think the comment and use of the word &#39;work&#39; was pretty obvious, and that I didn&#39;t mean it works with what we have learned since 150 AD... </p>

<p>Prior to Keppler, no astronomer was able to predict a transit of Venus, even though they knew it happened. Their model was always slightly wrong, but they ignored it because they didn&#39;t have anything better.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it worked.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously very important to you that I say it didn&#39;t work, so it didn&#39;t work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watch a lot of American drama on Netflix, through the screen it had me believing everyone in America was tall slim and beautiful. I went to America and I saw just normal folk.
You watch enough screened &#39;reality&#39; of something and you&#39;ll question whats really real.</p>

<p>Seen any terrorist activities, satanic workship, drugged up rip ya face off goofballs, muslims sporting the latest bomb vest fashions, tumours popping up after a diet coke, etc with your own eyes? No, nor me. The world is as you see it, any othrer shits made up or not worth worrying about in our little lives in the little time we have here.</p>

<p>If all all none of the theories prove true who really cares. Its just a drama on a screen. Pass the remote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should be able to detect that light doesn&#39;t travel but a few thousand miles pretty easily if this was reality. would it be super easy to replicate a test to do that? Light just losing power and disappearing makes no sense to me I can&#39;t wrap my head around it. Flat earthers say the sun is 3000 miles away or so but doesn&#39;t light up a area 3000 miles wide ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put simply, our atmosphere is like a glass of water - it refracts and reflects light.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/optpic/brokpen.jpg">We&#39;ve all seen this</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IV3Jpxm.png">Here is how it works on our spherical planet.</a></p>

<p>Th small red line on the right is the location of the observer on the surface. The dark blue line is the line of sight to the sun, which you can see is blocked by earth. If the observer looks to the left, he can not see the sun.</p>

<p>The yellow line is one ray of sunlight refracting in the atmosphere. As you can see, this ray is bent down and hits the observer. Reflection and refraction of sunlight is why our atmosphere glows blue.</p>

<p>Looking in the direction of the sun, the observer would see this reflected and refracted light as the sky glowing, getting brighter towards the horizon. But if he turns around, he would not see this light because the moon is orders of magnitude less bright than the sun, so not enough light from it is being reflected and refracted to cause the sky to glow.</p>

<p>So, facing the sun, the observer will see the edge of &#39;daylight&#39;, but facing away, he&#39;ll see night.</p>

<p>This video is <em>actually</em> proof that our planet is spherical because only a spherical planet surrounded by a relatively dense atmosphere could have the sun be hidden, yet the light from it still be visible.</p>
