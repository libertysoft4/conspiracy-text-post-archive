        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Because it&#39;s pushed almost 24/7 by the mainstream media, is widely known and accepted by much of society, and makes no sense even as a theory (i.e.: what is the difference between what Russia has alleged to do and what all other countries and corporations do, what&#39;s the difference beyond being butthurt about Hillary losing and wanting a bogeyman to explain it)?</p>

<p>If a huge segment of society accepts something as true, and the vast majority of society is at least widely aware of a theory, it&#39;s hardly the sort of thing to discuss here.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re &quot;pushing&quot; the narrative.</p>

<p>EDIT: As for the theory, it may very well be true that Putin worked with Trump.  So what?  The Clintons have worked with foreign countries to intervene in American politics for years.  What is the theory of what Russia did?  Some internet trolls?  A hack of real emails?  What&#39;s the actual scandal?  Like if the conspiracy was proven, what&#39;s the scandal in context of the fact that Trump&#39;s opponent was doing the same stuff with other countries.  Why do we care, unless we desperately hate Trump and want some sort of narrative to explain his existence in a moralistic way?</p>

<p>Second, r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t care about this because it&#39;s all over the press.  Yeah, the press reported on Nixon.  They did NOT dig into the Chennault affair or the break-ins at Brookings.  Think about it.</p>

<p>Trump being owned by the Rothschilds and on the same team as Hillary is a good conspiracy.  Being owned by Israel is a good conspiracy.  The press won&#39;t touch either idea.  But r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t need to rehash what&#39;s already on the front page of r/all, r/politics, etc etc on a daily basis, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also has a lot to do with the phrasing of the narrative they were trying to push.  They attempted to push HACKING in an effort to make Trump look like an illigitimate winner.  They were hopeful that if they used HACKING vs INTERFERENCE people would assume that actual voting ballots were tampered with which is obviously not the case.  The narrative falls short when most people realize that &quot;hacking&quot; simply means that the DNC server was hacked, emails were released that MAY HAVE swayed voters away from Hillary (which is not likely to a degree justified of altering results).</p>

<p>At any rate it still unreal that people are more concerned with WHO leaked information and could care less about the content.</p>

<p>Not to mention nobody cares how the US is constantly interfering with foreign elections.</p>

<p>As you know, the I.C. was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term.</p>

Clapper testified that three agencies (NSA, CIA, FBI) produced the intelligence report saying they were &quot;confident&quot; Russia interfered in the election. The other 14 agencies just piggybacked on top of that report, but they didn&#39;t perform any independent analysis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be. Rally the opposition by catering exactly to what they want (&quot;Hes an outsider&quot; &quot;Hes going to drain the swamp!&quot;). Massive media campaign against him polarized the country like crazy and made his supporters much more loyal, to the point that they look the other way whenever he does anything. Gets elected, tows the deep state line. Personally don&#39;t think this is the case, he actually is an outsider, hes just being manipulated in other ways now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also highly recommend the Corbett Report. Every episode is completely sourced.</p>

<p>I disagree that the MSM is completely useless. There are great journalists working for CNN, BBC, etc., but their stories are usually pushed aside in favor of corporate interests. Corbett actually acknowledges this, and a lot of his research comes from these very same outlets, such as the BBC (which he jokingly calls the &quot;Big Brother Corporation&quot;). There are a lot of conspiracies talked about in the MSM, but <em>no one connects the dots</em>. So you have these great stories here and there that are completely usurped by propaganda.</p>

<p>I also think that The Intercept, Truthdig, and Global Research are all great outlets. The Guardian also has surprisingly good investigative pieces, but it is also privy to MSM propaganda.</p>

<p>Would it not be better to use your critical thinking on the actual news and events instead of deciding if something is true or false because of how t is covered?</p>

<p>You&#39;re implying the media environment is in any way competitive. 90% is owned by 6 corporations, it&#39;s an oligopoly that uses monopolistic barriers to preserve their status.</p>

<p>I would argue that the interests of ownership among the 6 is much more alike than different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can still get some of your news from MSM, in fact you should.</p>

<p>The trick is to learn how to filter out the opinion. Lend greater weight to the <em>facts</em> in any given source, and take any commentary by the presenter with a MOBA sized grain of salt.</p>

<p>Each time a particular story interests you, find as many different sources on that article as you can. You&#39;ll discover that what you&#39;re actually looking at are secondary sources, and you&#39;ll recognize a shared primary source between different news sources. (I.E., several articles about a topic source a book that came out recently about that topic, the book is the primary source, the articles are secondary sources)</p>

<p>Over time, you&#39;ll find that different outlets have commentary that is more in line with your thinking based on having read a wide variety of sources. You&#39;ll find yourself gravitating to those sources for a period of time. That&#39;s okay. Your opinion will likely change over time, and different sources will be more appealing to you for different reasons.</p>

<p>As for specific sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reddit. This subreddit, the sidebar subreddits, and numerous other corner subreddits have great discussion. Avoid the defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube. Subscribe to people you find yourself watching more than 1-2 videos from. Explore related videos, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>4chan. Garbage heap, but breaks a lot of things first. /pol/ for politics, /x/ for paranormal/UFOs</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook (avoid if you can): If you have one, and like many people can&#39;t really drop it because it&#39;s your main contact to old friends, use it to &#39;Like&#39; pages. Use optimal privacy settings (I.E. set all posts to &#39;friends&#39; instead of &#39;global&#39;). There are plenty of reasons to hate this place so if you aren&#39;t signed up, don&#39;t. But for the people stuck there, there are lots of good pages to &#39;Like&#39;. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Absolutely Not</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Television. Turn that shit off. The ads fuck up your brain. Any relevant clips can be viewed on YouTube. You&#39;ll thank me once the brainwashing wears off.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, be aware, that on the internet, especially on Google/Facebook/AT&amp;T, you are always being tracked. Use screen names, proxies, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can still read MSM, but parse out any editorialized context and speculation. Most articles could be summarized into &quot;x happened&quot;, but they instead pad it with &quot;context&quot; to make it feel like a tale and speculation about where the tale goes next and why you should care.</p>

<p>Reduce news to JUST the things that happened and fill in the rest yourself. Other people&#39;s opinions aren&#39;t worth the weight they are usually given. Opinions, regardless who they belong to, are simply opinions. There are some people who may be more or less informed on a topic, but that almost NEVER means you should just assimilate or dismiss them because of this. Opinions are always subjective, so new perspectives are always more valuable than consensus. I will always value a unique perspective over a popular one on almost any topic.</p>

Superpowers hack all the time. Just because you don&#39;t hear about it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen. In most cases it happens and you don&#39;t hear about it. It just so happens this time the American public got to see emails of their own US politicians before an election. So if they are the ones that hack the DNC , what did Russia do wrong? I would rather see what my politicians are lying to me about then try to dig down some rabbit hole about how somebody exposed the lying politician.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and that&#39;s because the rationale for this investigation has changed every single time their shitty theory gets shot down.  It&#39;s been eight plus months of these accusations and literally zero hard evidence coming out in support of them, including even James Clapper (Obama&#39;s IC Boss Daddy) admitting that there&#39;s <em>no</em> evidence of collusion.  And that&#39;s because the story is a fat fucking nothingburger and a charade to push a war for hegemonic dominance.  It&#39;s political theater designed to cover up real crimes exposed by WikiLeaks during and after the election, and to save face because they got behind a disastrous campaign and candidate and can&#39;t handle the loss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re looking at it from another side of the lens, you could also see it as Comey being the only person obstructing investigation into Clinton and her Clinton Foundation or the nationwide pedophilia rings, or the fact that he was ridiculously incompetent in the first place and should have been fired months ago for not only refusing to bring charges against Hillary Clinton that were more than justified, but for continuing to help undermine the Trump Administration with bulshit accusations based on shaky evidence bolstered by the source of the claims - in this case, the head of the FBI Director Comey continuing an investigation that has after 8 months of continuous rampant speculation and fear-mongering produced exactly <em>jackshit</em> of hard evidence.  But the truth is probably somewhere in the middle and you&#39;re definitely still overestimating Russian influence in our politics when you should be looking at Israel&#39;s influence a whole lot more, as that has actual credible proof and evidence supporting it going back <em>decades</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, he deserved to be fired. But, the timing is pretty much proof that Trump is corrupt and Comey&#39;s people were getting close. They did issue subpoeneas for Flynn after all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the timing is definitely shady for sure, but you also have to realize there&#39;s a lot of things going on behind the background that are not being reported on that certainly could have had an impact on why Comey was fired, as we all know it was definitely for unofficial reasons.  What we don&#39;t know is what those reasons are.</p>

<p>Israel is involved in <em>plenty</em> of domestic affairs.  There&#39;s a reason AIPAC wields a ridiculous amount of power in Congress, just like there&#39;s a reason why tons of Mossad agents were routed out and arrested in the months following 9/11 for suspected ties to the plot itself, and why mostly everybody of importance tied to 9/11 in the profiting of the attack was a Zionist, Israeli politician or dual Israeli citizen working in the United States government or with the neoconservatives of the Bush Administration.  How about the five dancing Israelis (two were Mossad agents) that were captured on the day of the attacks and then let go, then appeared on Israeli national TV and admitted that they were there to &quot;document the event&quot;?   Why would Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly state that 9/11 was a great day for Israel?  What about <em>that</em> domestic abuse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fully aware that Putin is basically a mob boss that owns Russia.  But again he&#39;s really no different or any better or worse than any of our Presidents, it&#39;s whatever country you&#39;re born in and whatever propaganda you&#39;re fed.  These people ultimately all eat at the same tables and do business together regardless of whether they are official enemies or not. What people fail to realize is that there are no good guys in this.  Trump and Putin are two people looking out for their own interests and whatever is going to make their country the strongest.  The fact that both of them are strong nationalists is actually a good thing for us, collectively.  I&#39;m just solidly in favor of diplomacy and good relations with the only other country that can destroy us, for pretty common sense reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piece of advice, you shouldn&#39;t assume things. I read the article. CNN can print whatever they want about Clapper saying whatever he wants.  The FACT remains that UNDER OATH, in front of CONGRESS, he testified that there was no evidence.  </p>

<p>You have no argument other than to link to an outlet that we know for a fact colluded with the Clinton campaign.  I&#39;ll take congressional testimony over a corrupt rag any day.  </p>

<p>I could link to all of the articles about the new book by a Clinton insider claiming the Russia narrative was spun on election night.  But that&#39;s not provable evidence is it?  Like CNN clickbait articles are not provable evidence, and shouldn&#39;t be used in a serious discussion about accusations of the highest magnitude.  Try again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, the foundation of the entire Russian hacking narrative was <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">this thing</a>. </p>

<p>Professionally speaking, it is shit. Using that as a foundation for attribution is bush league and fails to point to any actual &quot;evidence&quot;. Furthermore, the source code has been available for some time so no speculation about the spooks having tools to populate malware with patterns used by other groups is required.</p>

<p>As a comparative example, <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-OPM-Data-Breach-How-the-Government-Jeopardized-Our-National-Security-for-More-than-a-Generation.pdf">here is a 110M PDF that details the investigation of the OPM breach</a>. The Chinese did that one but everyone seems to have forgotten that there are other countries in this world other than Russia.</p>

<p>Without a technical foundation the stronger narrative is that Russia is a cover for mass-internal surveillance of political opponents. </p>

<p>The link includes additional technical evidence that the Russian narrative doesn&#39;t hold water if the foundation starts with &quot;Russia hacked the election&quot;. </p>

<p>I understand that the content may be beyond your understanding and but I did offer to answer questions. </p>

<p>As I said, the evidence stands on it&#39;s own so trying to slide the narrative towards me with personal attacks leading to  &quot;he won&#39;t dox himself so he&#39;s lying&quot; isn&#39;t going to be an effective strategy today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again there needs to be some actual evidence of Russian influence in the White House because there has been no hard evidence and only a bunch of conjecture and political shit-flinging so far.  Now if you want to look for Zionist / Israeli influence in the White House, <strong>look who&#39;s fucking the Presidents daughter that literally shares his room with Bibi Netanyahu</strong>.</p>

<p>The Russian conspiracy is fodder for the idiot sheeple to rally the public to a frothing madness against both Trump (for having the audacity to beat them in 2016) and Putin (their boogeyman that triggers the left) so when the bottom drops out underneath the USA and Western world from banker fuckery, it will be blamed on the BRICS nations and their affiliates, and the public will explode and demand vengeance.  Yay, the elite get their World War 3 like they wanted!</p>

<p>If you want to know what the real conspiracy behind Trump is, look no further than Jared Kushner himself, Cadre and Lucent Technologies.  It&#39;s no accident that Kushner bought 666 5th Avenue for a record-breaking $1.8 billion dollars.  He is the true puppet master behind Ivanka and Trump.</p>

Sessions did not lie under oath and that has been conclusively proven.  What house did he clear at the CIA?  More importantly do not understand what the CIA actually does?  Comey deserved to be fired a million times over and both sides hated him for entirely different reasons that were both legitimate.  You sound like you&#39;re buying into a lot of partisan rhetoric and not looking at the Hard facts which is that there was no hard evidence or proof of ties between Trump and his campaign or Russia.  James Clapper himself even said this less than a few days ago, and he was in charge of basically every major intelligence service during the Obama Administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the CIA with all my being, but they had info about Trump&#39;s collusion with Russia but because they are a foreign agency, they couldn&#39;t do anything. Obama knew as president and ordered them to turn over everything to the FBI. </p>

<p>Also you remind me of all those people that downvoted and the mods that deleted the thread here about the secret meeting between trump and a russian agent caught on camera at an airport late in the primaries. Yet you were probably the same kind of person to call out and upvote the post about the meeting bill clinton had with the Obama AG. </p>

<p>Corruption runs deep in washington. Right now Trump is president and he is the center of this corruption. This is a huge conspiracy. Hell, throw in the isreal shit and deep state shit. Trump loves the shit out of Isreal, and he also had a weird meeting with Kissinger the other day that wasn&#39;t on the public record. Trump also has started selling weapons to terrorists, so there is that angle too. Corruption central and well beyond the obvious firing of the man investigating him. </p>

<p>I think I&#39;m always hoping to turn the station to laugh at both sides but then once either side raises my blood pressure (while driving, I might add), I turn it off.

    <div class="md"><p>For the record, I never disagreed with you lol. Honestly, I think we&#39;re stuck with it. There&#39;s no way the left is going to vote 3rd party in 2018 and 2020. If anything Trump&#39;s election pushed that divide even further apart.</p>

<p>But, I think more people are open to the idea of allowing more than one party, and realize that our system is antiquated. So in that respect, yeah, you&#39;re probably right that raising awareness is the only way. I voted Gary Johnson in the last two elections... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose you&#39;re right-lol. Sorry to be so defensive.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s great the libertarian party is on the ticket in all states but I worry about voting third-party now because I&#39;m paranoid they&#39;ll be more likely to steal the third-party votes. I can&#39;t believe how badly the third parties did this election, really disappointing. They couldn&#39;t have done that bad, right? But tptb are going to continue to keep them lower than 15% in the polls and out of debates and off any form of media.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem I had the last election: both third party candidates seemed like controlled opposition. So it seems the entire system is corrupted and even if a miracle happened and an honest POTUS was inaugurated, the deepstate would still take over the presidency through the carrot or stick method of control. </p>

<p>I lean libertarian myself (I only liked Bernie &#39;cuz I thought he was well-intentioned and honest) and normally would vote libertarian but didn&#39;t because of Gary being a total sellout. Gary and Bill endorsed HRC before the election, hurting their chances, and even called her a &quot;wonderful public servant.&quot;  Then Jill had recounts w/more funding than she could get as an actual candidate, all after she got what she wanted w/Hillary not being the president. So it just leaves you thinking that third parties got co-opted and that the entire thing is all for show and I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;ll even bother voting anymore. All we get is more of the same every damn time.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know what to do. So many problems need to be fixed, it&#39;s overwhelming but I remain somewhat idealistic that if enough people wake up to the sad reality, it can then be a catalyst for change. But even that seems pretty unrealistic, although not impossible and I suppose a good goal to strive for. Politics got so divisive this election, orchestrated by tptb who don&#39;t want us united, and now I need to work on improving my tone and trying to find common ground w/my least favorite people: neocons and neolibs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, I was being a dick too lol. Sorry for that.</p>

<p>In CO, GJ got 5%, and in Utah, Evan McMullin got 21%, which is astronomically higher than in 2012. So people are def waking up to the system and it&#39;s problems. But, I think you&#39;re generally right that the 3rd parties have little chance of catching on anytime soon, at least to get into the actual debate phase. Trump/Clinton really put that to grinding halt, especially with Trump winning. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll vote for Bernie if he&#39;s alive at 79 and running, and I would have voted for him in 2016, but the DNC fucked that up bad. Oh well. It is what it is.</p>

<p>And yeah, we could all work on our tone. I think everyone is frustrated and pissed off about where things are. People cling to ideology in this country, which is fine, but problems just continue to mount and people refuse to budge on their beliefs. Many of us seem pretty flexible. We know the healthcare system is fucked, we know the 1% gets everything, we know about the corruption, we know we need to make things right... But, we just don&#39;t seem to agree on the how. </p>

<p>Conversations like this give me some hope though. We&#39;re all just trying to figure it out, and we&#39;re all gonna have to keep talking it through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright so here&#39;s my conspiracy theory that stems back to Ukraine. </p>

<p>Putin take Crimea, sanctions are put on Russia, Russian economy suffers due to sanctions. Check a GDP graph and you&#39;ll see in 2014 there&#39;s a big drop and its only getting worse. </p>

<p>Russia wants sanctions to end. United States is the main country putting sanctions on. This leads to Russia wanting a pro Russia or Russia neutral leader as the president. Clearly that wouldn&#39;t be Hillary. </p>

<p>Rex Tillerson is our Secretary of state. Ex ExxonMobil CEO with a big stake in the company obviously. He directly benefits from laxxed sanctions on Russia due to the fact that they have vast potential for oil. </p>

<p>Trump attacked Syria in defense of &quot;chemical weapons&quot; which led to &quot;tensions rising&quot; between Russia and US. They both look good if they end the war in Syria over &quot;peace talks&quot; that end Russian sanctions. </p>

<p>But in the end, it&#39;s a conspiracy theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question, a serious question setting all politics and conspiracies aside for the moment: would we stand a chance against Russia, and on what terms? Im not suggesting we would lose, but the common US citizens view is of a backwards poor  wanna be american Russia and holds US as an unstoppable military force. I know we have the most nukes, battle cruisers, and the top tech, but what does thay mean in the scheme of things against Russia. </p>

<p>I hate the idea of war with Russia (or anyone for that matter). I feel like our cultures arent that different, and theres no reason we shouldnt get along. If my country was being attacked, i would defend it to the death. Id just never see myself going onto foreign soil to attack someone. How wouls russias people feel? How would they see us. How is the media successfully painting them as a technologically advanced yet equally insane/stupid version of north korea?</p>

<p>Its astonishing that clinton/supporters want a war with the other great power at all, especially when liberals claim to be so against war. I also realize the whole bipartisan thing is bullshit, but something has to be up with the trump pure hate train. Since before the election, my reddit and facebook feeds have been flooding nonstop with trump hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe in the Russia narrative, and that the current president, or at least his advisors, engaged in some shady shit with Russia to help win the election. But don&#39;t take my word for it. I&#39;m gonna post this comment from <a href="/r/AskTrumpSupporters">/r/AskTrumpSupporters</a>, which goes over the most important parts concisely. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, it&#39;s pretty much confirmed that Russia meddled into the election. They hacked the DNC servers and released damaging emails at opportune times to favor Trump over Hillary. They did not do the same to the RNC. Either they tried to and couldn&#39;t, didn&#39;t want to, or did and didn&#39;t get caught or release anything. Russia did the exact same thing this past week in the French election. Russia also produced a lot of real fake news and propaganda to sway the election for Trump.</p>

<p>The thing is, did Trump know about this at the time? Did he aid them or even give them the thumbs up to do all this? Any of that is likely highly illegal. It&#39;s not confirmed but there are a lot of circumstantial evidence that he (or at least his administration) did know and &quot;colluded&quot; with Russia to hack the DNC.</p>

<p>Flynn is the first confirmed illegal act. Before Trump&#39;s inauguration, Flynn violated the Logan Act and spoke to Russian diplomat about the sanctions President Obama placed on Russia. This is a violation because at the time, he did not actually hold a position at the WH yet. There is only one president at a time. But what&#39;s worse, he lied to Pence about it who then turned and told that lie to the media about it. Then recently it turned out that he took money from Russia illegally. You can&#39;t be a retired general with clearance and take money from a foreign aid. But most alarming is that Flynn&#39;s connection with Russia seems to be really strong.</p>

<p>Yates warned Trump about Flynn. Obama warned Trump about Flynn before he was even hired. However, did not fire him and Flynn kept his clearance until the media found out.</p>

<p>Sessions also lied under oath about never meeting with the same Russian diplomat during the election but then met with him twice.</p>

<p>Turns out many of the Trump administration has been meeting with Russians in foreign cities even during the election.</p>

<p>The unconfirmed dossier from an MI6 agent says Russia has dirt on Donald both financially and personally.</p>

<p>Trump won&#39;t release his tax returns which would shed some light on his dealings with Russia. (But not all).</p>

<p>Trump rarely attacks Putin on anything but seems to attack everybody else.</p>

<p>Trump has questions NATO and called it obsolete. NATO was originally formed to protect against Russia, and is still seen as anti-Russian.</p>

<p>Trump originally stated he wanted to work with Russia on fighting ISIS and not attacking Assaad. He has since turned on this issue and has attacked an airfield in Syria but it practically did nothing other than a show of force.</p>

<p>NOW, Trump fired the head of the FBI who was investigating the collusion. His timing and reasoning is EXTREMELY suspect.</p>

<p>This is sort of made an indisputable claim, because the basis of my argument is that we would never know if they have. </p>

<p>Though, to not simply escape the question one possible example is 9/11, more specifically the 28 pages that were declassified about a year ago. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I agree with you that assigning blame is different than a conviction. However, in this instance peoples&#39; opinions are being swayed by claims that have no evidence to support them. In a Democratic society I feel this is a large part of making a conviction, no? </p>

<p>Think of a jury, when they have made their opinion on a case they make a verdict. If guilty, there are repercussions. The verdict should not be based on unverifiable evidence, and it normally never is.</p>

<p>Essentially I&#39;m saying that Americans are the jury in this case, their opinion is being swayed by unverifiable evidence, which in my example would ultimately lead to a verdict. The repercussions in this case would be future voting behavior.</p>

<p>So these all seem to be examples of intelligence being used to promote the agenda of a sitting administration. How does that compare to this situation, where the IC appears to be directly investigating the sitting admin? </p>

<li><p>George Tenet said &quot;slam dunk.&quot; The administration and intelligence community was staffed with yes-men and people who were already on board with the larger plan to attack Iraq that had been planned since <em>before</em> 9/11 by the Bush Administration.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>The larger agenda always goes through regardless of whatever Administration is in power.  In this case, Iraq was the second of 7 planned targets that were picked out for war immediately following 9/11, and even earlier if you read the Project for a New American Century papers.  Rest assured the administrations made sure they staffed the IC with loyalists and other neoconservatives/neoliberals that would go along with things smoothly.  Vietnam War in general was part of a larger effort to fight proxy wars against Communist Russia and China while Rockefeller factories created weaponry to kill American GIs and created the drug trade in Southeast Asia to ship it back to America with the military and destroy our communities from within.  9/11 was part of a larger pretext to create a global war on terrorism to use as an excuse to invade and replace the last remaining sovereign nations that resisted the banking cartels, globalism or the will of Washington, London and the Vatican&#39;s New World Order.  The various ICs of the world (at the leadership levels) are mainly tools of the elite who spy on the public, keep their politicians in check via blackmail (honeypots, pedo/Brownstone op), death threats, bribery, slander, defamation, assassinations, whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are the claims I&#39;ve got from this article, not saying that these are the only claims, I may have misread or misunderstood some parts of the article;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Justice Department’s indictment of five Chinese hackers noted that they worked 9-to-5 Shanghai time and took an hour off for lunch, while previous FBI scrutiny of a group of Russian hackers concluded that they worked Moscow hours and paused for Orthodox Christmas</p>

<p>...there’s strong substantiation not just of the reuse of tools and techniques between operations, but also of the reuse of hacking infrastructure. It seems the same computers that were used to break into the DNC were also used against other targets, such as the German Parliament — all cases attributed by a variety of investigators to Russia. The computer security community has been following these particular Russian hacking groups for years, and the DNC hack easily fits the pattern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t read much into the work hours argument at its face, but coupled with the 2nd quote I provided it certainly raises suspicion.</p>

<p>My criticism though is that these arguments are hearsay. Show me <em>proof</em> of these claims instead of just someone <em>making</em> the claims. Once that happens I (and I&#39;m sure many others) will start to see your side of things, but as of now we haven&#39;t seen any objective evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost scary at how angry they get too when all you ask for is proof. </p>

<p>I was going through the posts today on the front page of Conspiracy, and once again, it&#39;s filled with replies that are angry, condescending, and thread derailing while only offering opinions, not fact. Opinions are perfectly fine! But lately they have been stated while being a condescending jerk. If you didn&#39;t agree with the stated opinion, you were basically an idiot.</p>

<p>The politic threads are over powering everything. 
There is an actual thread with a conspiracy that just happened to be politic related, but does not involve &quot;Russia is world killer&quot; narrative and of course, it was derailed immediately.</p>

<p>If anything, replying to threads more often lately, with my one &amp; only account, it is teaching me that I really shouldn&#39;t care when my karma drops lol.</p>

<p>I use to take it personally for some reason. but eh, it&#39;s means nothing, at least I feel better replying to people when things are getting out of hand :)</p>

<p>Right?  In all the years I&#39;ve been on reddit, this is the only place where my karma has ever nosedived.

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the issue is that a lot of people (including myself at one point) disbelieve the Russia narrative purely because they love Trump (which is what the deep state wants you to do; use emotion, not logic).</p>

<p>Its important to realize that you can dislike Trump AND use some logic and realize the fallacies with the Russian claims.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, all you need to do is picture yourself being in the driver seat.  Ask yourself, &quot;if i had all of the money and power, and I could harness all of the intelligence agencies, how would I unequivocally solve this problem?&quot;</p>

<p>And then ask &quot;why aren&#39;t THEY doing that?&quot;</p>

<p>Be the change you want to be. It is possible and it is worth fighting for else you give in and accept your fate as grist for the mill in service of the elites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>his scientific and environmental takes alone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By science, I assume you mean climate change. Few folks disagree that climate change isn&#39;t real and most will concede that it might even be human created. The part that doesn&#39;t fly is the solution <em>always</em> involves giving money to some other humans that don&#39;t know how to fix it either. For some reason they all seem to be similarly affiliated also.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled, &#39;climate change&#39; is a multi-billion dollar growth industry and like any other industry they are going to churn out whatever propaganda that supports their end game. As usual, normal folks are caught in the middle with incomplete information and being manipulated by both sides. </p>

<p>Good rule in life is that it should be a big warning sign when the primary recruiting slogan is &quot;you&#39;re stupid if you disagree&quot;. </p>

<p>For the environment, I&#39;m looking forward to the EPA going back to focusing on the obvious stuff; anyone remember what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Superfund_sites">superfund</a> site is? Anyone think it might be good to stop virtue signally about carbon credits and get some clean water to Flint? </p>

<p>This is kinda ironic, really, their funding is getting slashed left and right and you&#39;re looking for them to fix MORE things. Why don&#39;t you look at where that money is going? The defense and weapons industry. Like always. Clean water is something we have had for a long time, local city government knows how to fix Flint, so why don&#39;t they? As your link even said...the EPA seems quite busy already cleaning up our toxic messes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a local quarry by me, awesome little place. Nice little wading area, a 30 foot rock to jump off of, plenty of places to sprawl out. It is a real melting pot there too; hippies, bussinessmen, rich, poor, black, white, asian. Everyone goes there because it is so close to downtown you can make it there from the local college and back in-between a class, or lunch break. Dogs come along, some people grill out, swim, drink, do drugs, pretty much whatever is good as long as you aren&#39;t an ass hole to others. Now on the far end, there&#39;s a massive ledge, hundreds of feet from water to top of the cliff. The only way to get up there is by driving along a back road and of course there&#39;s a million and a half &quot;do not jump&quot; signs located up there, everyone I ever talked to at that quarry says somebody tries to jump up and every single time dies because there&#39;s old mining equipment below the surface where if the impact doesn&#39;t kill you, a broken back and inability to swim will. You can&#39;t get away from hearing this, sit anywhere in the quarry for 10 minutes and someone will bring up a death that happened recently from someone jumping off. It is a well known fact you should not jump off the top of that cliff, or you will die. </p>

<p>So what happened a few weeks ago. Someone went up to the top, jumped off, and died.</p>

<p>Sometimes trying to out think everyone else is as stupid as it sounds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it a straw man argument? The OP clearly said that this is something that&#39;s &quot;hardly the sort of thing to discuss here. Unless you&#39;re &quot;pushing&quot; the narrative.&quot;</p>

<p>Seriously, flat earth, alien visitation, etc. But Trump-Russia, that is where we should draw the line for what shouldn&#39;t be discussed here? </p>

<p>I say to hell with that. Trump-Russia is a conspiracy and should be allowed to be discussed within a conspiracy subreddit without being accused of pushing a narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>... Why should you be free from accusations that you&#39;re pushing a narrative?</p>

<p>Flat earthers are pushing a narrative</p>

<p>9/11 truthers are pushing a narrative</p>

<p>Pedogaters are pushing a narrative</p>

<p>So are Neomccarthyists with this russia shit. The difference is only one of these narratives is also being pushed by the mainstream media. </p>

<p>The trump russia one - which means there are plenty of places to discuss it outside of here. The value of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to me is that one is allowed to express ideas not promulgated by the news media 24/7. </p>

<p>If the narrative you are pushing is also backed by corporate media and mainstream politicians, its probably bullshit  </p>

The joint intelligence report with handwaving about bears and calling Russian Times reporting on US police violence and the pitfalls of the two party system, literally hacking the election. Or the totally debunked Hillary funded CrowdStrike, the only humans ever to inspect the hacked DNC server, report waving its hands about bears again, then the attempt to save it with a report ThreatConnect (Fidelis) trying to fix the debunked parts of the CrowdStrike&#39;s hand waving. It all started with the exposed as fake piss dossier long before the election. Now that it is almost a year old FBI investigation, it seems thoroughly debunked. There just is no evidence.</p>

<p>Whether Trump himself knows of it, we are unsure, but we would be surprised if Russia hadn&#39;t tried to do so. For some perspective, I have no doubt the US does the same thing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am a strong strong supporter of the idea that the DNC leaks were the work of an insider. Based on the process and fingerprints involved in the leaks. Overall motive: we think the Russians did it because Putin hates Hillary (almost more than I do lol).</p>

<p>Depending on how you choose to look at it, we&#39;re wayyy beyond &quot;Russia hacking the election&quot;.   A better title would be &quot;Possible traitors in the White House that have sold out the American people, complete with paper trails and money trails.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s still a conspiracy theory, as it hasn&#39;t been proven yet, but one would think on a Sub like this, that LOVES to dissect every little fucking thing, and even create shit where it doesn&#39;t exist, one would think that this sub would be ALL OVER this shit.

Exchanging a known deserter with no use for five high ranking, extremely dangerous generals is treasonous.  Going around sanctions put in place by Congress and sending BILLIONS OF US DOLLARS IN CASH ON PALLETS to Iran is treasonous.  I could go on and on but you don&#39;t understand what treason actually is.</p>

<p>You armchair political scientists have no grasp on reality. You ignore FACTS that directly affect the global landscape and cling to BS propagated by a corrupt media with nothing more than hearsay that does nothing more than divert your attention.</p>

<p>Tell me what hard evidence of &quot;shady shit&quot; do you base your argument on? The false claim that &quot;17 intelligence agencies agree?&quot; Even though they include the DoE and Coast Guard, and not a single one of them released an official statement in the matter?  That Manafort and Flynn had Russian dealings, and the moment Trump found out he got rid of them?  The FACT that both COMEY and CLAPPER both testified before CONGRESS that there was ZERO evidence of collusion? That after more than a year&#39;s worth of data collection and investigations there hasn&#39;t been a single shred of evidence presented to the public, other than by the private company with strong ties to the Clinton camp whom the DNC brought in over the FBI under Obama; who by the way have had to come out with major retractions.</p>

<p>But none of these FACTS matter do they because you FEEL good listening to Colbert and Maher and laughing at the Cheeto Drumpf?  Forget about Obama&#39;s extrajudicial drone striking of American citizens, let&#39;s spin Drumpf trying to do something Muslim countries do into somehow being anti-Muslim.  Let&#39;s forget about Clinton brokering the Uranium One deal to sell 20% of our uranium to Russia (total coincidence her campaign manager had 75k shares in the company) and spin Drumpf wanting to go the peaceful route with Russia into him somehow both working for Russia and also wanting WW3 with Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Panama Papers prove the Podesta has a financial relationship with Russia. He submitted an LD 1 disclosure form to Congress after the leak that also proves this connection. Money pours out of Sberbank, into RAS Corporate Services, through Troika Dialog and into Podesta&#39;s pocket.</p>

<p>That is just one avenue of payment. Still off the books and as of yet unreported is the arrangement to hide shares of Uranium One in Joule, and then give 100,000 shares (25,000 per year) to Podesta into his daughter&#39;s company, Leonidas LLC.</p>

<p>This is just a slice. The Clinton Foundation worked with Kazatomprom CEO (who was later arrested) and was paid millions for arranging a obfuscation scheme with Frank Giustra.</p>

<p>Frank Giustra got Kazatomprom uranium and put it in Uranium One. Then, he shut down Uranium One, sold all its assets to his canadian mining firm, then changed the name of his mining firm to Uranium One.</p>

<p>What is now Uranium One is actually not at all what the original was. Keep in mind, their quarterlies are published. The amount of money involved is staggering.</p>

<p>What no one is looking into is this deal and how many US politicians got paid. It was likely both sides of the aisle and it was likely hundreds of US officials who profited from this deal.</p>

<p>The real Russian investigation is right there, but no one is looking into it because the news wants everyone to think Trump is the one who is doing these things.</p>

<p>Pro-tip.... he&#39;s not. Not that I trust Kushner any further than you can throw him, but we already know who sluts out for Russian rubles and it mostly consists of Democrats and people surrounded by convicted pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can reject the &quot;Hillary lost because Russia Hacked the Elections&quot; narrative and still be concerned that our government officials are receiving bribes from foreign officials and agencies. You can be pissed off with the Clinton Foundation receives donations from Saudi Arabia among many other countries, and still be pissed off that Michael Flynn is accepting money from RT, Turkey, Ukraine, among others.  The real conspiracy here is how posts like this only serve to further the divide because they appeal to partisan politics. It is OK to hate both the Democratic and Republican parties. Because ultimately they are one in the same, they are both the Corporatist Party. Simply rejecting anything the MSM says, and automatically believing whatever the opposite of the MSM says is far too simplistic of an approach for overly complicated situations. Its like saying everything RT posts is the truth because its the opposite of the American MSM rhetoric. Both are propaganda. Simply believing the opposite of propaganda doesn&#39;t guarantee that what you believe isn&#39;t propaganda. Finding the truth requires complex thinking, reading between the lines and constantly searching for facts and evidence. If you stray too far into partisan politics you&#39;ll end up confused and your arguments will be illogical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue with the Trump-Russia narrative is the first bit - the modern American government wants to push Russia as the villain for doing the things that they do themselves internationally via the CIA and locally via the FBI. If we are to hold Russia accountable for hacking and attempted manipulation of the voting process, then we must hold the CIA accountable first, as they have a longer and bloodier history of it. American exceptionalism cannot be the rule when it comes to international diplomacy, as it will be actively protested by any legitimate foreign government by principle - and when that is not the case, the CIA usually ends up being involved, as revealed decades later. There is a good reason Iran is suspicious of the American government, and all people have equal right to hold these suspicions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Devil&#39;s advocate, some conspiracy theories are true, and some (even smaller portion) are actually revealed to be true (Watergate, for example). When a conspiracy ends up being proven by an entity like the FBI (I am NOT saying that is the case for Trump right now), the MSM will inevitably pick it up in droves. So if what you&#39;re saying is true, that conspiracy would cease to be valid for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Essentially you are advocating for suppresssing truth just because the MSM covers it. In that case, you are just as much as an unthinking pawn as someone that universally accepts the MSM truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The attitude towards Russia of being a scary evil empire is Cold War 2.0 fearmongering and propaganda.  They want us in a war because they will make a final killing on profits, and a very literal killing of the human population so they can have their reset because they fucked up again and we&#39;re getting too close to the truth of things again.</p>

<p>Remember that these people pushing this idiot US v Russia narrative are psychopaths that <em>create</em> the conflict and directly profit off both sides.  They would be happy if the vast majority of us were dead if they could somehow profit off of it. They are murderous warmongers, moralless scum devoid of empathy, Saturnic cultists and eugenicists, true demons in human form.  Russia is Enemy #1 because Putin and his government directly oppose these individuals on many levels, he has undermined their globalist agenda severely, and he&#39;s pretty much the only world leader who has succeeded in doing this.  Trump may have tried to fight the tide for a little while, but it&#39;s pretty clear he&#39;s either been tricked into carrying out their agenda, or he&#39;s been a &quot;company man&quot; the whole time.</p>

<p>Point being, it will always and has always been up to <em>us</em> to put a stop to this bullshit push for war.  That&#39;s because these puppet fucks will <em>never</em> do it.  They love war.  None of them have our interests in mind unless it becomes expedient for them to do so.  The best way to do extricate yourself from their control is to completely stop participating in their system as much as possible, become self-sufficient, take charge of your life and do whatever it is you love doing regardless of whether it&#39;s making you tons of fake fiat money.  Stop watching their TV shows, talking heads and programs, and learn to parse information and discern opinion from fact.  Go on YouTube and Reddit and other information centers and look for people who have similar views and resonate closely with the truth, see where they got their info from - follow the sources.  Avoid any of the left-right paradigm and their partisan talking points, because it is all misdirection to keep you at each other&#39;s throats masquerading as &quot;political discourse&quot;.</p>

<p>The Trump Russian narrative is beyond stupid and soaked with hypocrisy.  This ridiculous outrage at <em>completely unproven claims</em> of Russia meddling in our election don&#39;t even have a shred of proper sourcing, almost completely relying on speculation, conjecture, political bias and the Pissgate dossier that has been discredited up and down by even those on the left.  Russia probably technically tried to help hacking efforts to embarrass the DNC and specifically Hillary Clinton, if anything because <em>she was directly threatening to go to war with them</em>.  It&#39;s a matter of basic self-preservation to support the guy who wants stronger ties and no war, isn&#39;t it?  Isn&#39;t that basically what Donald Trump has been saying the whole time, that it&#39;s a good thing for Russia and the United States to be allies considering we&#39;re the only two countries that can pretty much <em>wipe out all life</em> on the planet?</p>

<p>Spying is intelligence 101.  This is basic statecraft between almost all nations, spying has always and will always be a thing.  There&#39;s nothing really significant about Russia doing this that can&#39;t also be attributed to the Chinese or Israel, where the ramifications of their spying was <em>much</em> more severe.  The irony is that this narrative is being flogged past death while the vast majority of Americans continue living in extreme ignorance of our own history of interference worldwide (past and current), or they&#39;re just bald-faced hypocrites and jingoists that thanks it&#39;s okay when America commits crimes and atrocities but is just <em>shocked</em> when anyone else does it in return.</p>

<p>It looks like the reason Russia wants Republicans in power is because Russia supports Assad in Syria, and the U.S. needs some political reason it can&#39;t topple Assad so the military industrial complex can endlessly fund/propagandize/profit off the quagmire in Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ty. I&#39;m not really surprised by the silence tho. It&#39;s clear that the Jackasses don&#39;t wanna piss of the Swamp Drainer-in-Chief right now, so they&#39;re content to play long-ball and stretch out any investigation &#39;til 2018. They need an independent commission, but the GrandOl&#39;Pretenders know this and will not just hand it to them. Has to be a tit-for-tat. If Jackasses insist on keeping the Russian flame alive, then the SDiC&#39;s new FBI pick will reciprocate by re-opening Hillary&#39;s wounds. Neither side has anything to gain but everything to lose. The SDiC and his MSM trumpeteers are now gonna attack from the flank with his newly executive-ordered <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/11/trump-to-sign-order-launching-voter-fraud-commission.html">Voter Fraud Commission</a> and focus on how Jackasses defrauded their own base. Meanwhile, the Jackasses and their MSM megaphones will ignore the feral Elephant crap and slowly settle on some forward-looking narrative that involves censorship of fake news and a tough posturing vis-a-vis the Russian Bear. The Jackasses will go along with this because, well, they&#39;re jackasses, and they&#39;re gonna ignore the herd of pink Elephants that have taken over the living room rather than talk about a revolution on the Animal Farm.</p>

<p>What, are supposed to be &#39;edgy&#39; (Well, if you think the earth is flat you are edgy).</p>

<p>I mean, right here on this sub people have whined and moaned that pizza gate <em>wasn&#39;t</em> getting covered and now I come to find out if something is getting covered it is bad and probably a lie.</p>

<p>And I keep seeing people here say &quot;Show me the evidence!&quot; evidence which is being tracked down and not made public....but these same people use an email about cheese pizza to say it proves hillary raped and ate babies in a basement of a pizza place (which was suspicious because you could play ping pong there and kids were allowed).</p>

<p>SMH - I don&#39;t understand the way all this shit works. A real conspiracy about collusion on multiple fronts going on and we should ignore it and talk about hillary instead because the news is covering it. Seriously, shit makes no sense - unless you look at it as people loyal to trump wanting to protect and deflect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But most here say the media is always lying so they aren&#39;t ever telling us anything (unless it is something we want to hear, then msm media is used and is ok for that story).</p>

<p>Not trusting them in a broad manner is different than whether or not you believe what they are saying. I know there is an investigation because I watched hours of it live. I also saw the msm boil that down to an article (don&#39;t own a tv so no idea what the idiots are saying on the air).</p>

<p>People have been caught lying, lost their jobs, etc and if anything, the media hasn&#39;t dug deep enough. Which is where I would guess people here would come in.</p>

<p>But that won&#39;t happen because many here are controlled by the donald and do not want to see more information on it all, they want less.</p>

<p>All those values and ideals they claim to hold are trashed for one man. And it looks like the same is true of the values of people in a conspiracy sub. They will ignore for one man and try to tell others not to do so as well because it is a waste; all the while preaching the earth is flat and run by reptilian overlords like hillary who uses the human race to produce children to use as pizza toppings.</p>

<p>When you ignore a real conspiracy happening today because you love one man so much, you aren&#39;t someone who cares about conspiracies - you are just loyal to a rich man from a tv show. And shame on those who are like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on this sub since almost the very beginning. I agree with you, and I have held your own viewpoint on this particular paradox that this place can often find itself in regarding the MSM and what is news that should or should not be posted here. One thing that cannot be done however, is to have anyone but the users define what conspiracies are up for discussion and have value.</p>

<p>For the most part your issue has never had to be seriously discussed outside of modmail and IRC because, in general, the fallback and &quot;out&quot; for people is the sub&#39;s base cultural value of no-censorship.</p>

<p>With that being said, the current makeup of the moderators and the bulk of the user base is pro-Trump, but mostly in the sense that  there was an overwhelming Hillary Sucks sentiment that a very few took to actively backing Trump. Mostly people here just couldn&#39;t stand Hillary and the neo-liberal branch of the oligarchy that she was a servant of.</p>

<p>That core of the longtime users of this subreddit try not to fall for the partisan stuff because they see it for what it really is, a means of dividing the population to keep them bickering amongst themselves over shit that they just do not have any control over, and, of course, a means of controlling wealth and power. The illusion of our current political system and The Powers behind it, to many here, <strong>is</strong> the real conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the distinction is this: everyone agrees Russia influenced the election (at evidenced today at the intelligence hearing) through very obvious and illicit means - and obviously in favor of one candidate.  This isn&#39;t debated stuff anymore - it&#39;s also never going to be justification for overturning the election results ... I don&#39;t think any sane person believes any of this is going to somehow &#39;re-write&#39; the election ... it&#39;s over, Hillary Clinton lost, &#39;liberals&#39; get it.</p>

<p>However, that isn&#39;t what the investigation is about ... the one being conducted by the FBI and both chambers of Congress concerns collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia before and during the election.  </p>

<p>Considering the implications, I prefer not being a Russian; if I did, I&#39;d move to Moscow.  The idea that he can&#39;t even be investigated is what will drive people into the streets.</p>

Why would you demand the end of an investigation that supposedly going to &#39;clear&#39; Donald Trump?  Why do conspiracy theories about what the &quot;Clintons did&quot; factor into the current FBI investigation into the Trump campaign?  If Russia is full of good guys who have just been misunderstood - why is the investigation being stalled by Donald Trump?</p>

<p>The conclusion hasn&#39;t been made - but it will be after an investigation (sound like law enforcement?  Welcome to the FBI).  Nobody is interested in scuttling the investigation anymore - not even Republicans.  &quot;Clinton&quot; theories just aren&#39;t going to get it done anymore.

    <div class="md"><p>Who are responsible for preventing the US elections from being hacked?  You certainly cannot blame the Russians.  I think it was not the Russians.  It was the Dems election to win, and they threw it away due to their own arrogance and incompetence.  If you look at the media coverage on election day, the Dems were already celebrating by noon.  The whole Russia narrative did not come about until they lost.  Then they needed someone else to blame, anyone, but themselves.  </p>

<p>Hillary was clearly the chosen candidate, and the American voters rebelled against her.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its hilarious how most people fail to point out and realize it was two separate &quot;hacking&quot; events. The DNC hack happened, someone hacked it and the &quot;russian&quot; footprints/fingerprints were found there. No one has explained who hacked Hillary&#39;s private server except the FBI. The FBI investigation of the DNC e-mails was basically making conclusions based on the Crowdstrike report. They did not have physical access to the DNC servers as stated by Comey himself.</p>

<p>The actual damaging e-mails all came from the DNC  e-mails regarding the election fraud and the DNC primary collusion. The Podesta e-mails were was done with a phishing e-mail and totally separate. They have conflated and merged these two events to make it seem as they were both perpetrated  by the same person. For gods sake the emails have different domain names yet everyone hears &quot;hacked the election&quot; and lumps all the e-mails together. The brainwashing to make everyone argue about e-mails and where they came from instead of the contents, has worked perfectly in my opinion. </p>

<p>It is made clear in the first few pages of the official FBI documents released at the FBI.GOV archives of the Hillary private server investigation that it was hacked by at least five state actors. That alone clearly states that she had classified information on a private server that was hacked! A crime in the USA and that is what everyone was screaming. She got let off the hook because the government didn&#39;t want to admit how much of our secrets were made available to our enemies/the world. And speculatively, I believe it was much more than that. I am sure once it was hacked,(Hillary&#39;s server) that someone leaked how to get in and those people who grabbed those contents were the ones who were getting vanned, at least the ones in America. But this is just speculation on my side.</p>

<p>Pedogate stems from the Podesta e-mails and not the DNC e-mail release. But you&#39;d be hard pressed to see anyone separate these two incidents when debating the topic. Crowdstrike was caught lying in their Ukraine report, so why is it so &quot;crazy&quot; to believe their Russian hacking report might have some errors too?</p>

But again he&#39;s really no different or any better or worse than any of our Presidents, it&#39;s whatever country you&#39;re born in and whatever propaganda you&#39;re fed.  These people ultimately all eat at the same tables and do business together regardless of whether they are official enemies or not. What people fail to realize is that there are no good guys in this.  Trump and Putin are two people looking out for their own interests and whatever is going to make their country the strongest.  The fact that both of them are strong nationalists is actually a good thing for us, collectively.  I&#39;m just solidly in favor of diplomacy and good relations with the only other country that can destroy us, for pretty common sense reasons.</p>
