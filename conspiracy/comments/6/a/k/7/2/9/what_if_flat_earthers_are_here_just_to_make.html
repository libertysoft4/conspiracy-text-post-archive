<p>&quot;As a result, the variation in surface elevation is less than 3 feet 3 inches over the entire 4,086 square mile area.  There are few areas on earth that are as flat.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an explanation in the thread that you linked to. It has to do with the fact that a salt flat acts more like a body of liquid than solid due to environmental conditions when it comes to curvature. It is basically a giant salt lake that gets smoothed over and flattened year after year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about places on earth having little to no curvature to see, and then claimed that water remains at level with no curvature (which then I said, get a hot air balloon and overlook the ocean). The point is, it&#39;s extremely difficult to see any sort of curvature from sea level. It&#39;s very difficult to see curvature with the human field of view at that level.</p>

<p>If you have a camera with a larger field of view that takes in more of the horizon at sea level, you will be able to see the curvature more clearly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does a picture like that show anything? I fail to follow the logic in the OP there that the center of the picture is somehow supposed to be higher. The horizon is equidistant in all directions from where you stand (assuming perfectly spherical earth, rather than the oblate spheroid with elevation differences that it is).</p>

<p>Why would any &#39;dipping&#39; be observed? Imagine looking in one direction  x, then it sounds like that OP expects dipping on an angle to the left (y). But if you had originally looked at y, then shouldn&#39;t x be dipped using the same logic? They can&#39;t both dip relative to each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you getting so angry and cussing at people in these threads? </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t answered my questions on this thread. I&#39;m not trolling, I seriously want to know what evidence you think is compelling.  I thought about it more and did some research looking at websites and youtube videos. I still don&#39;t find it convincing. Maybe you could give me a top 3 best knockdown arguments that you find convincing?</p>

<p>For me, it presents too many problems that need ad hoc conspiracies to wave them away. I also researched this Chicago skyline photo too. Based on this webpage <a href="http://www.abc57.com/story/31830937/skyline-skepticism-the-lake-michigan-mirage">http://www.abc57.com/story/31830937/skyline-skepticism-the-lake-michigan-mirage</a>, he was standing on top of Tower Hill which is 250 feet above Lake Michigan. Add 6 feet for his assumed height and you have 744 feet obscured by horizon just doing simple back of the envelope calculations. The height of Sears tower is 1450 feet so 1450 - 744 = 706 feet of tower that should be visible on a clear day and assuming no refractive effects of the atmosphere. If you have refractive effects, this fully explains the many images that people have produced. It is all explained here <a href="https://flatearthinsanity.blogspot.com/2016/07/chicago-skyline-looming-from-mi.html">https://flatearthinsanity.blogspot.com/2016/07/chicago-skyline-looming-from-mi.html</a>.</p>

The horizon there is likely artificially limited to some distance, with no relationship to curvature or altitude or anything like that.

While there&#39;s no obvious &#39;dipping&#39; of the city. It just gets smaller over distance. They basically just use a flat-earth like representation in their model with some max limit at which they put their horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t magically cease at any point. And your statement really makes no sense. People do see things which ought to be hidden beyond the curvature. That might be as they say, refraction, a mirage, a play of the light. But it is beyond the curve, beyond the horizon, and occurring. This is regardless of the observer.</p>

<p>Regardless, you are still missing the point. The arguments usually go that some play of the light allows sight of otherwise unviewable objects, but the reverse is never true, that viewable objects cannot be seen when they should. They wish to have their cake and eat it, too. Although it could be the case that refraction always works towards the observer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just listed things that are plausible (to at least some degree, though the &quot;holograms&quot; thing is a really weird and unfounded claim) using technology we know exists and has been fully researched by science and engineered examples can be seen everywhere. Sandy Hook and the Holocaust are simply matters of evidencing crimes using available resources, and requires some (minimal) amount of human intent and intervention to become accepted fact. In other words, the existing facts are able to be contested/demonstrated through forensic methodology, and alternative, plausible explanations can be said to exist for all above examples.</p>

<p>The flat earth theory, however, has no scientific research to substantiate it. It guess against the grain of known scientific laws such as the law of gravity. It would therefore requires not only the known body of physical science, but also natural math and the number system to be a complete forgery. This has not been demonstrated successfully, and natural math continues to be the basis for discoveries in the physical sciences and the globe by people of diverse cultures and independently in many cases. There is no plausible and fully explained alternative that describes the movement of heavenly bodies like the currently accepted heliocentric model. There are pictures taken from anything from passenger jets to space agencies to private corporations that show curvature of the earth, pictures of the roundness of earth from space, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>In other words, the plausibility of the flat earth theory is of a far, far more vanishing degree than anything else you listed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany&#39;s economy was in shambles after WWI. A small number of people in the United States had amassed a fortune though. These people were afraid of the spread of communism and the rise of the Soviet Union. They wanted to make sure nobody could ever take claim to their wealth. </p>

<p>These people went out searching for an extreme group to finance. Groups with very extreme ideologies thay would usually be ignored were given special attention. Soon they realized Hitler was their man. </p>

<p>They financed his Hitlers rise to power but not only that, they were eager to get the United States into the conflict because they saw an opportunity to profit off both sides of the war. </p>

<p>Measures were taken to spark Japanese aggression and we knew in advance that pearl harbor would be attacked. Defenses were lowered to result in maximum damage. Americans were outraged and immediately joined the fray. </p>

<p>These people really didn&#39;t care who won the war because at the end of the day they would be in control either way. </p>

<p>But more importantly, I think you&#39;re missing something out of your western values. They contain <em>both</em> individualism and democracy (group/collective decision making and action). The entire history of &quot;Western&quot; thought is a balance of the two (traditionally traced to ancient Greece at least), you can&#39;t leave out the group/democracy part.</p>

<p>I will give you that the individual is sacred.

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your viewpoint and I apologise for denigrating your opinion in my first post in this thread.</p>

<p>Personal responsibility <em>is</em> a major aspect of the human condition but I don&#39;t know if I would call it the meaning of life.</p>

<p>I know you would help your children and parents if they needed it, your brothers and their children... Possibly your cousins and their families... Some particular friends and neighbors... some extremely unlucky member of your community... But at some point along this continuum you would stop calling it your &quot;responsibility&quot; (perhaps right after the first hurdle). Me too.</p>

<p>But I <em>want</em> to live in a family/town/city/community/country/world where those who can help those who need, even if I do more giving than receiving. where there is a decent public health system,  education for everyone, basic transport and infrastructure as standard, accountable law enforcement, collective fire department, national defense. Some things <em>can work better</em> on a group scale.</p>

<p>But note that I&#39;m not saying all those things <strong>always</strong> work better if socialized. There are tons of examples of success and failure throughout history and the world, and you guys just love to pick the disasters and throw your hands up, claiming it can never work... <em>ignoring all the cases where it does</em>. Socialism + might is dangerous but the same can be said of pure free markets + might.</p>

<p>I think the &quot;Nanny State&quot; presents a moral hazard and the free market should be the basic engine of the economy. I believe in equal opportunity but I don&#39;t believe in equal outcomes. I believe in incentives for hard work, inventiveness, raw intelligence, risk-taking, but I don&#39;t think inherited wealth should stagnate and &quot;sink up&quot; to the top 0.1%...</p>

<p>How do you feel about &quot;accepting the freebee of grandpa&#39;s millions??&quot;</p>

<p>As far as &quot;degenerate cultural values&quot; I&#39;m not even sure what you mean. I&#39;d say the two top degenerate cultural values I know are &quot;the church of the free market&quot; (it works to solve some things so it ought to be applied to everything) and basic &quot;Sod you, Jack, I&#39;ve got mine.&quot;</p>

So if it has 90% likes I know it&#39;s gonna be good quality &amp; the content I&#39;m looking for. If it has 90% dislikes I know it&#39;s going to be shit but not because of Stern. It&#39;s be poorly titled or bad sound or something. </p>

<p>So a 70-80% liked flat earth video just means other flat earthers thought it was a quality video. If I were looking to see what makes these flat earthers tick I would start with a video like that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I thought this was a known approach to viewing likes/dislikes. </p>

<p>Of course it is. The people seeking out and watching videos like Eric Dubay&#39;s are those who are fans of his.</p>

<p>Unless a video gets linked to somewhere else on Reddit or something for being stupid and a bunch of people dislike it then the videos of a FE video will be mostly likes by like minded individuals.</p>

<p>This is all to keep people ignorant to the truth of how easy it is to just, well stop all this bullshit. If people were beaten over the head with how few people are controlling their entire lives and for the worse, and how easy it would be to just change it all and keep it changed... well we can&#39;t have that, so people must either worship God, or worship Government as the solution to the problem and not their own actions. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also a common tactic used by conspiracy theorists. I&#39;ve seen people use two or three degrees of separation to try to &quot;prove&quot; that someone is guilty of something: A met B, who knows C, and C is guilty of a crime, therefore A is guilty too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it as a double whammy though. I think flat-earth theory also has this &quot;credibility&quot; because we live in an age where it so easy to prove that 99% of &quot;trusted&quot; sources are lying to you.</p>

<p>The public is developing major trust issues and our physical reality is already very weird and hard to explain.</p>

<p>I definitely have substantial evidence to support and then believe that the earth im standing on is a sphere, but to entertain the idea that it&#39;s flat isn&#39;t nearly as insane as many people might think at first glance.</p>

<p>Hell even the system of &quot;belief&quot; is illogical as fuck. When someone asks you &quot;hey, does the ocean appear to be blue?&quot; it&#39;s not like you go through the inventory of your life&#39;s experiences/research before answering - you just grunt out some subconscious (and ultimately pre-programmed) response with probably verrry little thought. I&#39;m sure plenty of us have a long list of shit saved in our brain that&#39;s actually just flat out wrong, because it was saved wrong back when we &quot;learned&quot; about it. Blurr the lines a bit over some time, and suddenly this solid, defined 4D life we live is more like a complicated delusion than anything else.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make here folks is - we&#39;re all here learning together. Let&#39;s try not be too insensitive or egomaniacal when teaching each other, or discovering truths.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t dispute for a second that we have millions of people in this country, so fucking gullible, they&#39;ll believe ANYTHING a little magic box tells them is true......hence why they vote democrat or republican......but there is NO QUESTION, that all of these smoke screen laughable &quot;conspiracies&quot; are being planted to make all conspiracies look equally crazy. </p>

<p>People are easily manipulated, some are taking the bait, others are trolling for fun, but this is absolutely being pushed HARD by those who want to smoke screen their real doings. </p>

<p>I call it &quot;the balance&quot; essentially, only so many people can become hip to the bullshit, or the machine stops, so when google searches for certain events with &quot;hoax&quot; or &quot;conspiracy&quot; start getting too heavy, it&#39;s important that a bunch of this wacked out shit is injected to make any normal, fairly sane person feel stupid for even thinking to watch or read more on it. </p>

<p>Believe it or not there is a lot of sketchy things when it comes to NASA and the apparent lack of curvature of this Earth and a lot of people like to look into it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had discussions with people who genuinely try to explain and provide links - but most just like to comment and call everyone retarded. You&#39;re not smart for believing what everyone on earth currently assumes - just like FE aren&#39;t smart for going against it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean, hope I didn&#39;t come off rude myself. I just have 100% confidence that whatever science info he is feeding me is going to be as non-bullshit as it can possibly be. I know he doesn&#39;t have a hidden agenda or paid for by shills or just whatever the fuck. </p>

<p>I just asked him to give me the lowdown on global warming one day, and he explained it to me as thoroughly as he could. Explained to me what they do in order to test for these things and how they have basically direct correlation to global warming and manmade greenhouse gases, etc.</p>

<p>Anyways I&#39;m not trying to go on a global warming tirade, but I think if the earth were flat, or we didn&#39;t land on the moon or global warming was bullshit. He&#39;d tell it to me straight up, I&#39;ve known him for almost 20 years. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got on that tho </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol that picture is proof positive of curvature but I do love how it gets brought up often as proof of Flat Earth, very ironic.</p>

<p>Why are only the tops of buildings visible? Why are the bottom of the buildings blocked by the curve of the Earth?</p>

<p>Atmospheric refraction , especially over cool bodies of water, affects the math of how far and what you can see. </p>

<p><a href="https://flatearthinsanity.blogspot.com/2016/07/chicago-skyline-looming-from-mi.html">https://flatearthinsanity.blogspot.com/2016/07/chicago-skyline-looming-from-mi.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a great explanation with video evidence of the refraction as well as all the math involved. Flat Earthers have linked me the exact same image you did and all the math for curvature as well many times. It is thoroughly debunked. The picture you linked is a GREAT example of a curved Earth because much of the city is missing due to curvature, which is proven by math in the link I provided. As <a href="https://youtu.be/o_W280R_Jt8">MinutePhysics</a> points out, if the Earth didn’t curve and the horizon didn’t exist, when you looked at Chicago from across Lake Michigan, you’d be able to see the the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Ah but I see from the other comment you just sent that you don&#39;t trust &quot;experimental mathematics&quot; aka completely valid and thoroughly tested math based on hundreds of years of testing and research on physics.</p>

<p>Like most Flat Earthers this confuses you because you don&#39;t understand therefore it is &quot;experimental&quot; yet you are willing to believe wholeheartedly in the the Earth Curvature Calculator and never take into consideration other factors (with equal mathematical and scientific backing) </p>

<p>Fair enough. Here are a multitude of experiments you yourself can do to prove the Earth is a round spinning ball:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/7-diy-experiments-b-o-b-the-earth-is-round/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/7-diy-experiments-b-o-b-the-earth-is-round/</a></p>

<p>I have done the Coriolis Effect one myself.</p>

<p>I also live right next to the beach and have watched a ship sail away with binoculars (no it did not reappear as FE&#39;s say it will) just slowly descended below the horizon.</p>

<p>A hilarious and cheap one if you got the time and gumption is :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You move in a straight line for a long enough distance</p></li>
<li><p>Turn right 90° degrees, walk in that same direction for the same distance</p></li>
<li><p>Turn again to the right 90° degrees and walk again the same distance</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff4bcb29cf5f9a2eaf00371f682047a3.webp">After this you&#39;ll end up at the starting point. This is not possible  on a flat surface since you&#39;d just be &quot;drawing&quot; a half-finished square.</a></p>

<p>You can also fly to Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Watch a sunset then take the elevator to the top of the super high building and watch the same sunset again. You can do this with any conveniently located really tall skyscraper of your choosing. but it will work best with some real big bastards like 1WTC etc.</p>

<p>Planes have flown around the world many times :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, in one sentence you question <em>what are only the tops of building visible</em> and two sentences later you answer your own question : <em>Atmospheric refraction .. affects the math of how far you can see</em> </p>

<p>At 8 inches per mile squared not even the top of the Sear’s tower should be visible. </p>

<p>Your link including it’s theoretical physics proves nothing. Otherwise please explain in your own words what it proves.</p>

<p>And your claim that you should be able to see the Rocky Mountains is laughable for the same reason as stated above (i.e. <em>Atmospheric refraction .. affects the math of how far you can see</em> ). Why don’t you look at a forecast from Chicago or Michigan and notice the value for <em>Visibility</em> <a href="https://weather.com/weather/today/l/USIL0225:1:US">Here you go!</a> - today the visibility is 10 miles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you don&#39;t trust &quot;experimental mathematics&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve presented zero experiments. Only theory. Give us an experiment or observation that we can both repeat which proves the earth is a spinning ball.</p>

<p>The Earth Curvature Calculator is an approximation based on your theory. It is not created by a Flat Earther and all of the mathematics is there for you to see. Otherwise calculate it by hand and compare the results. You see the difference is you don’t have to believe in the calculator - it merely takes the official curvature 8 in/ mi ^ 2 and calculates it for you.</p>

<p>Do you really believe this is anything more than pseudoscience? Lay on a flat sidewalk and watch your friend walk away from you. He will appear to get smaller and smaller until you cannot even see him anymore. Stand up and notice that you can see him from that new perspective. You are literally proving my point with this one.</p>

<p>Oh you’ve got a video of CGI ISS? I’ve got a video of Matt Damon surviving on Mars. I guess that is proof that Mars is a planet?</p>

<p>All of that math is tested and verified.</p>

<p>You can clearly see in the video of the Sears tower how it over the course of the day depending on the level of refraction good from visible to not visible and back again.</p>

<p>If it was a flat Earth you wouldn&#39;t just see half the building. </p>

<p>The visibility numbers DEPEND on a big round earth for their math to work out and also take refraction into account!</p>

<p>You are the one cherry picking my man.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t give you an experiment because you don&#39;t believe or understand any of the underlying science behind them.</p>

<p>There is zero explanation for how changing your &quot;perspective&quot; on a flat Earth in height would allow you to watch a sunset again. That&#39;s not how perspective works at all.</p>

<p>Do you have any tests that prove a flat Earth because I&#39;ve never seen one except for some outdated and debunked experiments from like the 1800s trying to measure the &quot;firmament&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y6ii4vsdsc">This video</a> which shows the multiple buildings when they should be obstructed by earth&#39;s supposed curvature? Yea that proves my point very well. Visibility is always affected by moisture so, yes near the water light is refracted but mirages do not as form as perfect replicas of a skyline in the exact position where they should be. <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJfJTdy2Ge8/maxresdefault.jpg">Superior Mirages</a> invert the image.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... over the course of the day depending on the level of refraction good from visible to not visible and back again.</p>

<p>You mean how it becomes visible when night falls and the buildings are illuminated. That is to be expected. <a href="https://weather.com/weather/today/l/USIL0225:1:US">Chicago Forecast</a> : according to The Weather Channel is 10 miles today. I wouldn&#39;t expect to see anything across the Lake unless conditions are perfect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What? You&#39;ve missed the point entirely. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The boat should not be visible from that distance.</p></li>
<li><p>What you claim appears to disappear from the bottom up is actaully just beyond your ability to see. Zoom in and the entire boat is visible nothing is covered by earth&#39;s curvature.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please post a real photo of curvature obstructing anything at a distance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The visibility numbers depend on the &quot;experimental&quot; round earth math to function dude, you use accepted science whenever it suits your worldview but dismiss it when it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Nope visibility is an actual measure - it is testable observable and repeatable. Debunking pseudoscience is actual.  Just the fact that you use &#39;accepted science&#39; proves you are not scientist, sir. Science has nothing to do with democracy. </p>

<p>Again, please give us an experiment or observation we can repeat which proves the earth is a spinning ball.</p>

<p>Would you believe the earth was curved if you were the only man on earth and had never been taught otherwise? Does it seem like we are spinning at hundreds of mph? Does it seem like some of us are actually upside down, held to earth by a theoretical and unproven force?</p>

<p>We can test the earth&#39;s magnetic field against a local field and measure them both. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8U9QOj_TE">Example</a></p>

<p>Fun Fact! Newton did not know about electromagnetism (officially discovered in the 19th Century).</p>

<p>So we can measure and prove the earth&#39;s magnetic field has an effect on other magnetic fields. We can measure and prove the magnetic fields present in all physical matter, including inorganic material.</p>

<p>We can control the buoyancy of a submarine, hot air balloon or helium balloon by changing it&#39;s density. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL3Ez9bxMTo">Hoe Does a Lava Lamp Work?</a></p>

<p>Where is your experiment to prove gravity? That is to say, proof that mass inherently attracts mass? All mass is comprised of physical matter which produces electromagnetic fields.

<p>Gravity can be tested over and over and over again.

<p>You could set up a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">Cavendish Experiments</a> in your backyard if you got the gumption.</p>

<p>There is no explanation in your theory that electro-magnetism is behind all attraction/repulsion for why an object continues to accelerate at a constant rate over time. <a href="https://stanford.edu/%7Eajspakow/downloads/outreach/gravity-student-10-7-09.pdf">https://stanford.edu/~ajspakow/downloads/outreach/gravity-student-10-7-09.pdf</a> you can do this experiment if you like.</p>

<p>As seen here:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBIydqBHFes">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBIydqBHFes</a></p>

<p>You yourself are taking a big leap from &quot;there is no test I can do in my backyard to prove gravity exists&quot; (even if there is) to &quot;I can see evidence of electromagnetism so that must be the sole force of attraction in the universe even if there are no valid tests showing that to be so&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easiest experiment? Sit on the ground with an unobstructed view of a sunset. As soon as the sun goes under the horizon stand up and you can see the sun again. If the Earth was flat, sitting or standing wouldnt matter. (This one has been mentioned else where in this thread)</p>

<p>Harder experiment: Record sunrise and sunset one day and travel either North or South a significant distance (Im talking about Canada to Mexico distance ~1200 miles) and record again. You will find that the length of the day changes with latitude, and also what time of the year it is. A flat earth would have no day change based on latitude (or even the season).</p>

<p>Furthermore, I gave up in the video when i realize that Eric Dubay had no understanding of gravity whatsoever. He keeps talking about rivers traveling a long distance, and that if the earth was curved, they would have to travel up hill then down hill (up the curve then down the curve). He is imagining drawing a line between the start and end and saying from that line gravity is down. Either he really is an idiot (likely) or he is intentionally misrepresenting gravity to prove his point. </p>

<p>No one is claiming that the length of day would be different - I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t honestly investigated this theory, have you? Different latitude experience different lengths of day because the sun rotates near the earth and near the equator.

<p>First of all, this isnt true. If you think its true, then you have never actually been somewhere flat.</p>

<p>The second one though... Good. God. Any tiny amount of critical thinking destroys that &quot;model&quot;. How about we go through just a few of the reasons why that &quot;model&quot; is absurd.</p>

<ol>
<li> According to this image, the sun only lights up the area below it. Clearly the sun is not round then, because if it was, then as long as it is above the &quot;flat&quot; earth you would be able to see it. You would have to have some edge to the sun that would be like a lamp moving around in the sky, but if that were the case then on off angles instead of being a circle it would become elongated (an oval). Except the sun is always round.</li>
<li>Next, if the sun is always in the sky directly above (as in the picture) it would never drop below the horizon. It would just be in the sky then suddenly gone.</li>
<li>In order for that map to work, everything in the southern hemisphere has to get stretched to make it lie flat. This in turns causes huge oceans to the south which are significantly larger than have been known for hundreds of years. Just compare the distance between the tip of South America to Africa and the US to Europe. They are roughly the same distance, but that map makes it almost 3 times farther. Shit, just look at the size of the Pacific compared to the Atlantic.</li>
<li>You could never go in a straight line either east or west, as you would have to keep turning otherwise if you went far enough you would be going south.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could go on an on about the number of issues with this &quot;model&quot;.</p>

<p>Lastly, your strawman argument about gravity. Did you even watch the video you linked? According to the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can describe gravity. We can say what it does to other things. We can...We can measure it, predict with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I called Eric Dubay an idiot because he has no understanding of gravity, and he doesnt, because he is, in fact, an idiot. We know enough about gravity to predict how it interacts with something as small as an atom all the way to galaxies and the structure of the universe. Recently, scientists have even detected gravitational waves. You don&#39;t have to &quot;prove the theory of gravity&quot; (which i don&#39;t even know what you mean by that, and you certainly dont either) in order to <em>understand</em> gravity. And Eric Dubay doesn&#39;t even have a middle school knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Honestly though, all this thread and shown me is the completely and utter lack of critical thinking skills required to believe such a theory. Truly, I now know that those people are even more delusional that i first imagined, which also lets me know there is no point arguing with such people. They are so far into their delusion that nothing will change their minds. Thus, I&#39;m out.</p>

<p>Why does a helium balloon rise? Gravity? No, it is trying to reach a state of equilibrium where the environment is equally dense. Same with the apple that fell on Newton’s head - the surrounding air is less dense therefore it falls. No gravity is needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because as many things in this world are still unknown when someone comes and challenges something very elementary such as the shape of the earth, they aren&#39;t just challenging our knowledge, they are challenging our intellect. I&#39;m​ no scientist but I can use logic to understand the shape of the earth by using scientific reasoning: sunsets, roundness of horizon, timezones, watching a timelapse of the celestial bodies as the earth rotates, pilots and sailors circumnavigating the earth, etc..., all of which do not go against a round earth model. So when someone comes along and challenges that they are also challenging my ability to use logic and I must be some sheep just listening to our overlords. That&#39;s my take on why people are so defensive about this issue. Tell me Bush did 9/11 and I&#39;ll say prove it because I don&#39;t have evidence he did or didn&#39;t, but I do know the earth ain&#39;t flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>watch the links, do the scientitic experiments your self (8 inches per mile squared) and you will see how easy it is to prove the earth is 100% flat. I would have never thought i would ever say something lie this, but if you actually look at it with an open mind (and with good understanding of the globe model) you will see it immediatly.</p>

<p>As you said, the attack on Flat Earth is very huge and organized, there is a good reason for that. Majority of Flat Earthers are NOT religious not cases, most of them examined the evidence themselves and were forced to accept that it shows the earth to be flat. This does raise the possibility of a creator (for me as well even though i was one of the biggest evolution and globe earth fans out there) but non of the thousands of flat earth friends on facebook i have will tell you its the same creator in the bible or quran or whatever. Only a few flat earthers do so because &quot;the bible says so&quot; and those are not better that people who blindly believe the globe with out investigating it first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing the links, that&#39;s s ton of info. I&#39;ve seen some and will check out the rest, as I&#39;m sure the flat-deniers will as well. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a good point about religion. I&#39;m not religious but even when I believed in the Big Bang it seemed like a creator or creators set creation in motion like computer code, and it&#39;s still tough for me yo see how any of reality is accident or coincidence. Still, maybe a lot of hate for flat earth theories goes hand in hand with hate against religion, or that some scientific-minded people are conditioned to only believe in science dogma and shun any kind of creation theory. But creator or not, the earth appears to be flat for whatever reason, and after simple observation it&#39;s tough to deny that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my theory. </p>

<p>That there is a secret out there so big that if it got out it would completely change the entire world. Some powerful people know and they are taking every step imaginable to keep it a secret. </p>

<p>Whenever someone gets a little too close they go into full suppress mode. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just Flat Earth and PG, it&#39;s almost all of them (UFO&#39;s, Bigfoot, etc.). And I think they are all part of the same secret. </p>

<p>The secret? That our world history is a complete lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be right. I can just feel it. I&#39;ll bet we aren&#39;t even touching on the actual secret stuff, but the first domino may be ready to fall which will eventually lead to the truth. The earth may be round, but flat earthers believe space is fake, and <em>that</em> might be the secret. Or there may be secret vast resource-filled continents beyond Antarctica, which, if exposed and people made a run for it, could wipe out world hunger and destroy the international economy, and <em>that</em> might be it. Or incredible technology or cures for all illness is hidden. Or like you say, the true history of life on earth could be revealed thanks to this kind of questioning. </p>

<p>Part of me is terrified of the truth. There is also a slight, albeit very minuscule, possibility that those in power have a benevolent reason for the great deception (that would go against everything we&#39;ve seen from TPTB), such as keeping people from learning something that is forbidden knowledge, something aliens or other entities have forbidden for whatever reason. Maybe it&#39;s the hollow entrance to earth in Antarctica where terrible evil exists. Maybe just knowing it will change space and time! Of course that&#39;s taking it on a fantastical route, but truth is stranger than fiction, as we may well find out soon enough. </p>

<p>It certainly does. If someone told you that when they eat food its broken down by shit elves and put into a furnace you would laugh in their face. To what lengths should you go through to prove its a normal biological process?</p>

<p>My point still stands. A normal person doesnt have the technology to see an electron travel and a normal person doesnt have the technology to view exoplanets. </p>

<p>Why is one not magic but the other is? </p>

<p>I would also argue that with a little research into PCBs and how they function you could understand how it works without fancy technology. You can perform an experiment and see if the result at the end is what we would expect if an electron moves across the board. </p>

<p>Same with cosmology. </p>

<p>6 posts simply asking about FE theory (along the lines of &quot;what is the best argument for flat earth&quot;), neither positive nor negative</p>

<p>10 Posts arguing against flat earth or arguing that it is a psy-op</p>

<p>17 posts either supporting flat earth or complaining that people are calling it out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I certainly don&#39;t want to make the people of this sub seem <em>bad</em>! And you said far more than one word, but who&#39;s really counting. Spaceflight: all evidence points to all of NASA being complete fakery (bubbles in the water of &quot;spacewalk&quot; videos, green screen and astronauts hanging on wires on ISS, ISS videos showing no clouds at all at night, too much curvature of the earth, or sometimes forgetting to put lights on the night, satellites and ISS is made of material which should melt where they are, video of the spinning globe but <em>no</em> moving clouds at all, the photoshopped word <strong>sex</strong> written in clouds in official NASA photos of the earth, Moon Landings: Ha, don&#39;t get me started!) </p>

<p>Satellites are unnecessary and might not exist. Why have none of the 10,000 satellites in orbit ever seen in ISS video? Everything a satellite is supposed to do can be done by planes, cables and towers.</p>

<p>not a single piece of that is true or accurate. Just because NASA might fake some shit to make pictures look good or create a flashy website, does not mean that nothing has ever left our orbit.

    <div class="md"><p>NASA&#39;s website designers may be the same people who design the images of outer space. There never seems to be a single untouched picture published by NASA. Can uou see the problem? We have no way of knowing if it&#39;s all completely faked. It&#39;s all complicated because NASA may be a scam, and the earth may still be a globe, or the earth may be s globe but thry csn&#39;t leave LEO for some reason so thry hsve to fake everything, or outer space is not what they say it is, so they fake everything, or the earth is concave but space travel is real...we have no way to be sure if any of this is true.</p>

<p>The temperatures supposedly can reach up to 4000 degrees where ISS is, thousands degrees hotter than the melying points of its materials (aluminum, titsnium, etc). The ISS may even be up there, but people can&#39;t survive on it. DirectTV could easily be just signals pointing to towers which repeat the signal, just like radio communications. That&#39;s why dishes aren&#39;t pointing up as you would think: they point to the towers. There is also an idea that the government figured out how to interact signals with thd <em>dome</em>, exactly how satellites are supposed to work. Did you know an author came up with satellites as fiction, and they supposedly became fact only two years later? Hmmm....</p>

<p>But death is not instantaneous. For example, one 1965 study by researchers at the Brooks Air Force Base in Texas showed that dogs exposed to near vacuum—one three-hundred-eightieth of atmospheric pressure at sea level—for up to 90 seconds always survived. During their exposure, they were unconscious and paralyzed. Gas expelled from their bowels and stomachs caused simultaneous defecation, projectile vomiting and urination. They suffered massive seizures. Their tongues were often coated in ice and the dogs swelled to resemble &quot;an inflated goatskin bag,&quot; the authors wrote. But after slight repressurization the dogs shrank back down, began to breathe, and after 10 to 15 minutes at sea level pressure, they managed to walk, though it took a few more minutes for their apparent blindness to wear off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think everyone at boeing, lockheed, or spaceX is a shill? I&#39;ve watched the &#39;200 proofs the earth is flat&#39; video, and its literally the same misunderstanding of basic science 20-30 times. Go get a degree in mechanical engineering. Study combustion, or maybe EE and do satellite communication. TEST what they teach you on your own, don&#39;t take any of it for granted. Use your own findings to convince yourself. Don&#39;t live in a reality where you are question basic things that you can test yourself. There are so many things we have to question, and so many others that can be answered with just introductory knowledge of math and physics. Or maybe astronomy: get a decent telescope, and learn the constellations. Watch as they change seasonally. Then go down to the southern hemisphere and see new ones! We live in a world of physical, natural realities that we can understand, and perhaps super-natural realities that we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I think, aside from the scientific illiteracy of the flat-earth dogma, the thing that bothers me the most is how they are wasting their time on something so TESTABLE, when there is so much more interesting and enigmatic things to consider .</p>

My point is not that I believe in unicorns or a flat earth, but that we should stop outright dismissing even the most outlandish claims. Usually there is a nugget of truth buried very deeply.

<p>Ive heard this one before! So the upper atmosphere is actually really hot, way hotter than one would think. Like 2500C in the thermosphere where the ISS sits. What you are forgetting is how little gas there is. </p>

<p>So if you have a handful of molocules per square foot even though they are at a high temperature there isnt enough of them to feel it. </p>

<p>It would be like having a grain of rice 2500C and tossing it in with sand. The sand wont rise to 2500C</p>

<p>Cheeky composite artist. NASA never denied it shopped composite images together. Because satellites dont fly <em>that</em> high up when they take a photo its only of a very small part of the earth so after a dozens of passes the satellite has piece by piece taken photos of the whole planet. Now the clouds wont line up because they are in motion so they edit them to give the best images possible and never once have they lied about it being edited. </p>

<p>Look up the DSCOVR-EPIC satellite. These are unedited whole Earth photos. </p>

<p>Nope. Without getting into too much detail the company I work for rents time on a satellite and I can say for certain the topographical data we get cannot be recreated by using towers or planes. </p>

<p>Nice comment. I don&#39;t want to fuel the &#39;flat earthers&#39;, however I <em>do</em> disagree with this statement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_retroreflectors_on_the_Moon">Russia is known to also have two mirror arrays on the moon</a>; clearly they had no manned missions so I don&#39;t think you could use that as evidence to support <em>man</em> landed.

<p>We need air, food, water, warmth, protection from radiation and long term affects of Zero-G on the frail human body. A spaceship that can cater for these needs are going to cost and <em>weigh</em> considerably more than an unmanned lander, meaning lots of fuel.</p>

<p>And that is just the plain old facts. Just look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon">US <em>unmanned</em> failures</a>.

<p>Food doesn&#39;t need to weigh that much. </p>

<p>Water does weigh more. Although is still just a bit more weight. </p>

<p>0-g isn&#39;t going to be a huge concern for a week. Keep in mind the record is over a year.</p>

<p>Yes, 5 years prior they had issues, and then fixed the issues. The math was improved, and suddenly it wasn&#39;t that bad.</p>

<p>Yes, the ship would cost a lot. And it did. Weighing over 6.5 million pounds, it could put a load of 310 000 pounds into orbit. Including the fuel. And once in orbit you&#39;re done the hard part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tl;dr: I don&#39;t firmly believe any of this as of yet. These are just ideas, and I only speak for myself. I&#39;m curious as to the shape of the earth and the nature of reality. I&#39;m not sure what shape earth is for certain, but most signs point to it being far different than what mainstream science and the governments that control it say it is. I know the theories, and believe some of it and have problems with some of it. You&#39;d have to watch the thousands of videos out there for a grasp of commonly accepted flat earth theory. But what I would start with, is seeking answers to the problems of your commonly accepted world. </p>

<p>Fermi&#39;s paradox: where is everyone? There should be someone else, but there isn&#39;t. Why? This all could be a hologram projected from somewhere else, another dimension maybe. Or a zoo, or petri <em>dish.</em> A domed earth could be a place for safe-keeping of life, by someone out there, whatever out there is. </p>

<p>When you look at stars through a telescope and ignore the official science book pictures, the stars appear to us as though they are behind glass and within water. Sonoluminescence is light from frequency vibration in water, and those little mini-stars they can make with sound in a bubble in water in labs actually look just like some of the stars we see in the sky. </p>

<p>Who made the earth and/or dome? That&#39;s like asking what existed before the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened, there are only theories. I don&#39;t know, but one theory of mine is that we are put here not by creators but by preservers of sorts. Something surely created them, but that&#39;s another story. In every direction, if the earth is domed, we are held back, kept from escaping, which means we may have been put here for observation like a zoo, or a type of ark. We have only ever dug 8 measly miles into the earth, because the molten rock keeps us from digging deeper. If you go up, you can&#39;t breathe, hit deadly radiation, hit the dome possibly. Try to venture out, salt water and stormy seas are a barrier, then you get to ice and stormy weather and deadly cold, again thin air you can&#39;t breathe at high altitudes and then possibly the dome. It seems something put us here. It could have all happened by chance, a one in a 10 to the 40th power chance for life alone, and that&#39;s to say nothing of the chance of the universe forming how it did, and how it led to life being possible, or it could all be an experiment or remnants of a previous dead intelligent life out there, a repeating program to keep something of themselves around before the universe collapses. Or god(s) only knows.</p>

<p>In our reality, we exist in exactly the right conditions for life against all incredible odds, there are signs of repeating code, patterns all over the place, signs this was all created. Maybe there was no purpose, maybe the creators were crazy. We may never know. But time and technology have led the human race to a point where we wonder why we are here and test boundaries in every direction. The U.S. government&#39;s Operation Fishbowl may have tested the dome, and satellite technology (bouncing signals off the dome?) came soon after. Someone may know the truth, and no matter if the earth is flat or concave or something, that someone doesn&#39;t want us to ask questions for some reason.</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t the other planets flat? Merely observing things in the sky is no proof of the shape of our own earth. They can theorize that gravity makes balls of matter at that scale, but that is only a theory, and one possibly made to keep up with the narrative of a spinning ball zooming through space at a ridiculous 600 million miles per hour, spinning 1000 miles per hour. The stars may be very close, and they may be something totally different than science books say. Add to that the possibility of a dome, and as I said, another barrier to keep us here, creators or preservers may have put an infinite hologram on it, so you&#39;ll only ever see mostly empty space no matter where you look.</p>

<p>Also tl;dr: the earth may or not be flat, or may be curved, but is not the size if not the shape that science teaches for sure. What it is and why we are here can only lead to speculation. </p>

I don&#39;t have concrete beliefs in any of this yet, and I admit there are problems in both models, flat or globe (maybe it&#39;s concave of course, which probably has its own problems). Going back before one month, you won&#39;t even find anything flat earth in my reddit history so I am new to this. Before that I was firmly believing in the globe earth. Things change, and I have to look at all the evidence, of which there is a vast amount of, on youtube and other places. Either way, there is much to learn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to understand the issue is not the height, but the speed. GPS location uses 3 different signals from different satellites to triangulate your location. It does this by having the satellite send what time it is by radio. Knowing the satellite is in a fixed geostationary orbit, and knowing their time is correct due to an atomic clock, your phone can do math to figure out where it is.</p>

<p>Saying that you&#39;re closer to the satellites is pretty stupid to. They&#39;re 35786 KM away from the earth. 12 kilometers doesn&#39;t make a difference. But the speed does, since your phone can&#39;t do the math fast enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you&#39;re talking about me? I&#39;m not disagreeing with him. He just made the mistake of trying to answer your premise (that GPS doesn&#39;t work on airplanes) when the premise is false. There&#39;s a firmware encoded speed and altitude limit in civilian GPS receivers set by the military, which aren&#39;t reached by airplanes. But below that limit, higher speeds still require clearer and more consistent signal than when stationary. If you&#39;re stationary in a vessel with no GPS reception, you get no GPS. If you&#39;re going 500 mph in a vessel with no GPS reception, you also get no GPS. If you&#39;re stationary in a vessel with poor GPS reception, you can eventually get a lock because the software can piece together a triangulation from intermittent signal pickups from multiple satellites. If you&#39;re going 500 mph in a vessel with poor GPS reception, the software may not acquire a lock because the distance you&#39;ve moved between signal pickups is too great for the software to reliably gauge accuracy.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s your turn to explain Flat Earth theory, since you seem to be saying different things from dandroid1_0, who is saying GPS does work everywhere (even on a boat in the middle of the ocean) because there&#39;s either secret radio towers everywhere or because radio towers transit a lot farther than we think due to it bouncing off of some dome that covers the earth.</p>

<p>To an extent. Mobile phones do use assisted GPS, not pure GPS. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/A4tFQJy.png">well, most of the time</a>. This is because the GPS in your phone isn&#39;t exactly quick. Ever missed a turn, or taken a wrong exit while running google maps? It shows you following the route for a little bit because it&#39;s assuming you&#39;ll be there. After seeing you haven&#39;t, it takes your new position, and takes a little bit to re-calibrate to your new position, plus the route of course. </p>

<p>At a high speed, with only GPS, a mobile phone will have a hard time getting a lock. Yes, in theory it should work well. However some planes do have connectivity issues. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can use gps/cell at airport inside a plane ok? So &quot;metallic shell&quot; theory is garbage.</p>

<p>I used to have a dedicated GPS before I had a cell phone. it was a piece of shit. I had to be outside or in my car while setting a destination, not in my house. Otherwise it wouldn&#39;t get a signal. Cloudy days caused signal loss. Driving down streets with tall buildings even caused signal loss. Not having it on my dash, caused signal loss. </p>

<p>Just because you know your location doesn&#39;t mean the actual GPS chip is in use. WiFi, Triangulation, and even data collection can be used to figure out where you are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that people traced the rocket&#39;s exact path, right? It&#39;s not like anyone lost sight of it ever. Also, the Soviet Union would absolutely have rather shown the United States to be untrustworthy and liars than just let them have a huge victory in prestige. Also, again, given that the Soviets had every incentive to prove them wrong so that they could show the world the superiority of Soviet technology and how the Americans were liars, they would have been monitoring the flights very closely, the whole way through. The Soviets had also penetrated the American bureaucracy thoroughly, and would have known if there was any attempt at a conspiracy, especially one involving literally hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p>Like today, only a handful of people need to know. Anyone who knows and starts making noise at the preposterousness of it gets taken out in a fiery accident, like Vitgil Grissom. Again, think of all the people today who think the Moon Landings were real, even with all the pictures and video and endless anslysis which they did not have in the 60s, and you can see how duped they all were then, governments included. </p>

<p>The Sagnac experiment is a really interesting one and we to this day use the sagnac effect in gyroscopic lasers to detect inertia. This does not break special relativity and is worth a few minutes of looking over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that because those experiments don&#39;t understand relative perspective. </p>

<p>we have video footage in 4k high definition of sphere Earth from the ISS. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s not enough to evidence to convince you that Earth is a sphere I don&#39;t know what else would or could be. </p>

<p>there&#39;s also the evidence of gravity. </p>

<p>Which isn&#39;t itself it&#39;s own entity, but is a description of acceleration towards a point. </p>

<p>this is accepted due to multiple experiments. </p>

<p>such as using pendulum clocks at different altitudes and measuring time differences. </p>

<p>we have speed test with airplanes too that have time tests too. </p>

<p>as far as density and buoyancy that the flat Earthers preach is gravity can be tested and fails miserably because if everything was that, then everything in the water atmosphere etc would simply even out unless constantly mixed. what could possibly be mixing all the matter together? </p>

<p>the flat earth movement is nothing more than a bunch of ignorant people using wit to convince other ignorant people of an idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>flat earth theory is too self centered. The axis wobbles, further the sun sets over the horizon. That wouldn&#39;t happen due to &quot;perspective&quot; as people claim.

<p>I think youre forgetting an SR71 cruises at about 90k feet. Remember curvature calculations do require an elevation calculation. Besides Im failing to see how curvature would be an issue for a plane, just maintain altitude and fly. Can you explain why you mention this and why its relevant? </p>

<p>Can you explain why you think the G forces from... Acceleration (I guess) would be too much? Where do you think the G forces are coming from and what G force do you think it is and why wouldnt a pilot be able to handle them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2300Mph?</p>

<p>So v = 2300Mph</p>

<p>Centripetal Force = m a = m v<sup>2</sup> / R</p>

<p>The masses cancel,</p>

<p>a = v<sup>2</sup> / R</p>

<p>Radius of Earth = R = 3959 mi</p>

<p>Since the mass, m, of the object (plane) doesn&#39;t change much, and so the net acceleration, a, caused by bending a trajectory around a curve of radius R at speed v is,</p>

<p>a = v<sup>2</sup> / R = (2300Mph)<sup>2</sup> / (3959 mi)</p>

<p>a = 1336 Mi / hr<sup>2</sup> = 0.5444 ft/s<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Acceleration due to gravity,</p>

<p>g = 32.2 ft/s<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>So the Number of Gs generated is,</p>

<h1>of G = a / g = (0.5444)/ (32.2)</h1>

<h1>of G = 0.01691</h1>

<p>Using purely classical mechanics, the G-Forces generated by a plane travelling that speed close to the surface of the Earth is about 2% of gravity; i.e, ~0.02 Gs.</p>

<p>Since the calculation is dependent on 1/R, if one were to fly higher than the surface of the Earth the G-Forces would decrease. At 3 mi above the Earth (R = 3962 mi) the Gs become,</p>

<h1>of G = 0.01689</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they really do. Whether the earth is spherical or flat, the #1 proof of a so-called globe earth is that ships disappear over the curved horizon, which is faulty. Since we know now that these ships can be brought back with a camera zoom, we know that they do not disappear over a curve. Bringing them back in a zoom would be impossible if they went over a curve. </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t get at all is why such an earth would be enveloped by a gigantic dome. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we exist in a simulation, as various philosophers and an increasing number of physicists have posited, then the creators of that simulation may have not felt the need to extend the architecture of that simulation beyond what we would call Low Earth Orbit. </p>

<p>Nothing from within our simulation would be able to travel beyond a certain point, because there is nothing beyond that point, at least not a reality that we would be able to experience. And yes, this would mean space travel is impossible, because space is not part of our simulated universe. The movement of the sun, moon and other stars and planets is nothing more than a 2d projection on that &quot;gigantic dome&quot;. And of course NASA and other space agencies would be very well aware of this limit to our simulated world - it is one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUx1SURbb3g">&quot;truth&#39;s protective layers&quot;</a> as Neil Armstrong cryptically described it in a rare public appearance 25 years&#39; after the Apollo 11 mission.</p>

<p>And if we are living in a simulated universe, then perhaps the certainty that we are living on a sphere hurtling through space (as opposed to a flat earth) is misplaced and ultimately irrelevant, because we aren&#39;t &quot;living&quot;, period. </p>

<p>Do they need to come &quot;from&quot; anywhere? If we&#39;re in a simulation, they&#39;re just part of the illusion to make us believe there is matter beyond the perimeter. But the true illusion is that there is no matter inside the perimeter, either.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe learning the truth of our artificial reality convinced them there was no such thing as God (or Satan)? Why didn&#39;t any of the 100,000 individuals working on the Manhattan Project blow the whistle that they were creating a weapon that could destroy all of humanity? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the beliefs that the idea historically ties to are what cause that idea. But what you were saying about not trusting anyone, I feel like thats starting to be me. At first when I was younger I watched a lot of Jk assassination type conspiracies. That was more supported as being a conspiracy. But now im at a point where I just google anything and then conspiracy after it. I guess its like, well if they are willing to lie about this, why couldn&#39;t this also be a lie?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I&#39;m at this point too. I always think everyone has ulterior motives or malicious intent for everything they do. Or that they&#39;re completely fake and being paid to push some kind of narrative. I even have a hard time trusting people like Snowden and Assange now because I can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re compromised. But once you&#39;re at this point I guess there&#39;s no going back. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in the wrong for thinking this way but it definitely doesn&#39;t make things easy.</p>

<p>IMO the evidence for a spherical model far outweighs the evidence for a flat earth but that doesnt mean their evidence should be ignored. Infact it may (conjecture obviously) point to a larger sphere than previously thought.</p>

They say they are going to colonize a red light in the sky. They say they went to the moon and took dune buggies in suitcases. A camera waited for them to snap a picture of the landing. They say they have bombs that destroy whole cities, and show you video of model train sets blowing up to prove it. The camera is impervious to the blast? Wake up. They show you CGI of a spinning ball over and over. And we believed this shit, all of it, like the fucking morons they took us for. Not anymore, not me. Question everything they pound in.

<p>There&#39;s is literally so much evidence but there is one problem... Most people I speak to, I say to them &#39;&#39;how can I prove Earth is flat to you&quot;. To which there reply is that they don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>How can I prove something to you when you don&#39;t even know what evidence you are looking for? So many people are quick to point out that you can see ships at sea going over the curvature. But when shown high altitude balloon footage showing a flat horizon then go on to claim that you are not high enough to see the curve.. These people will constantly move away from facts and enforce their own beliefs when you clearly show things that contradict their argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh okay.</p>

<p>So tell me - do you think humans built this ice wall?</p>

<p>This ice wall is around the entirety of Antarctica, right? Which in the FE theory would be essentially the outer perimeter of the Earth, right? How many miles long would that be? How absurdly expensive would it be to build that wall?</p>

<p>More importantly: to what fucking end?</p>

<p>This looks to me to be a damn cliff. Those exist everywhere. And how does a wall actually stop anyone with sufficient gear to scale it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay at least you think it&#39;s natural and not manmade.</p>

<p>Explain to me why the sun&#39;s circuit would cause this phenomenon? Such a sharp edge? That&#39;s not how any heat source I&#39;ve ever observed behaves.</p>

<p>More importantly than that you need to explain how the sun&#39;s circuit interacts with observed reality. Most significantly: explain a fucking sunset.</p>

<p>I was interested. I wanted you to at least attempt to have substance to your answers. Maybe more than thirty or so characters at a time to contradict centuries of science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look above in this thread. There was just a guy claiming supersonic flight on a round earth would be impossible because the G forces from the centripetal force would kill the pilot. He did 1 line of algebra to &quot;prove&quot; this, which simple calculated how much curvature would be experienced per second. The actual math:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Centripetal force, the source any G&#39;s they&#39;d experience is given by: F=mv<sup>2/r.</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So lets take &quot;v&quot; at at your value of about <strong>300m*s</strong>  and &quot;m&quot; at the mass of a 727 (since SR71 mass in unpublished), which is <strong>40000kg</strong>.</p>

<p>Then we divide by &quot;r&quot;, which is the radius of earth at <strong>6.3 million</strong> meters. We wind up with: <strong>F=571 Newtons</strong>.</p>

<p>Now look at what &quot;1 G force&quot; is on the same plane. 1 G = m<em>a where a is the gravitational acceleration on earth of 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> and &quot;m&quot; is again 40,000kg. 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup></em>40,000kg = <strong>392,000 N</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, the force of acceleration due to earths curvature is <strong>0.001 G</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it wouldn&#39;t. If the sun is a very far way away (like in the round earth model) then the shadow would be the same everywhere. If the sun is close (like in most flat earth models) then the shadow would depend on how close you were to it, but you definitely wouldn&#39;t get the same results on a flat earth as you would on a round earth.</p>

<p>To illustrate, on a round earth the sun would cast no shadow on the stick at the equator at noon, but if you were at the north pole the shadow would be very long because the light rays would be near parallel to the ground. If the sun was directly overhead on a flat earth it would also cast no shadow but no matter how far you moved away from that point (even if you went all the way to edge of the disk) you would never see the super long north pole type shadow. That&#39;s an extreme example, but the difference would be apparent even at normal distances.</p>

<p>There are other planets in our solar system that you can view with a telescope. Its not unusual for a planets moon to become tidally locked (I think its like 20 or 30% of satellites are locked). </p>

<p>If you wanted you could go watch Jupiter or mars and observe their moons. We can see more than 50% of their moons surface. We can even observe a moon moving behind its respective planet. </p>

<p>So if every planet and satellite in our solar system is a globe what proof do you have that the Earth and its satellite is different?</p>

<p>You first image is again pretty easily refuted. The company I work for rents time on an imaging satellite for topographical stuffs. Look at how warped those continents would have to be for this to work. There is no way that has gone unnoticed by everyone. I mean you think the Japanese would bomb Pearl Harbor in secret but behind closed doors every military is in on this? </p>

<p>As for your second image, the UN map not showing Antarctica doesnt prove much of anything. </p>

<p>Wait, you have proven nothing.</p>

<p>The image I posted as a <em>model</em> is an <em>illustration</em> and I think that should be apparent to anyone who is honest.

Clear enough to see them &quot;spin&quot;. For example there is a very large &quot;scar&quot; on Mars. If you watch Mars over a long enough time you can see that scar turn away from you. This shows at the very least Mars is a globe and spins. </p>

<p>If you get a fancy enough telescope you can see moons orbit their respective planets by going in front of then behind them. This is getting into pretty pricey territory for a telescope but not impossible. </p>

<p>Wait, you have proven nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you accept telescopes are real right? If every other celestial body we observe is a globe then what evidence do you have that Earth is unique in that regard. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t present that as photographic evidence, it is merely meant to enlighten those who don&#39;t understand the first thing about the FE theory and therefore believe things like you can&#39;t circumnavigate the flat earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im very active on FE subs I understand your map. At no point in time though has any sailor, any navy never noticed that projected paths on a globe do not line up perfectly with projected paths on a FE? Unless every single worlds navy and long distance sailor is in on it then you havent proven anything. </p>

<p>But if they rotate, which we can observe by watching marks on the planet, like the scar I mentioned on Mars that means we see more than 50% of the surface. How would this mean they arent globes? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>As I have said previously through observation with a telescope you can observe the planets showing us different faces, they do this in a very regular fashion meaning they are globes. You could project a radio signal at the planet and see how long it takes to return to you. </p>

<p>You could use parallax to determine how far planets are. Set up two different viewing points on the planet and then determine the discrepancy between the two results to find approximate distance. </p>

<p>You could finally observe the impact the planets have on the objects around them. regardless of whether or not you believe gravity we know for certain that planets project influence of some kind on the objects in our solar system. Because we have so much data about gravity and can very accurately model these interactions we can  determine the mass and gravitational influence these planets project. </p>

<p>Do you know of a model that can be that accurate? </p>

<p>Heres a video from the kirdistan planetarium (Not affiliated with NASA) of Mars rotating. Now they have a very nice setup and you can see a lot of detail. Higher end home telescopes can make out a little lower level of quality. If you had the desire you could verify this. </p>

<p>No, the mechanism is unproven. Even then there are some very compelling theories and it is a matter of time before the mechanism is definitively proven. The model of gravity works fine. As an aside you were never able to provide an alternative, can you explain what you believe and why its superior?</p>

<p>You cant have density without an attracting force... like gravity. I dont  believe you ever challenged the point I raised a while ago about mixing oil and water in zero gravity, they will not separate. So why will they separate when near a large object with gravitational potential? Helium is less dense but only if there is a force pulling all the gases at an equal rate. You have not explained or given an alternative to gravitation. </p>

<p>Why will you not? </p>

<p>Not many ancient people believed that... At least as of about 1800 years ago. Look up the mayans and their incredibly advanced cosmological calendar. Eratosthenes figured out the circumference of the Earth in 300 BC. The idea ancient people honestly believed that is disingenuous. </p>

<p>No. Density is merely the amount of compactness in a substance. </p>

<p>Consider this: When Newton developed his theory of gravity he was unaware of the magnetic force. Today we know that every body, where it be organic or otherwise, has a magnetic field. Both of our models agree that earth itself has a giant magnetic field with a pole at the north. Magnetic fields are absolutely observable and testable.

So we can prove that magnetism has the ability to attract and repel objects and energies. </p>

<p>In addition, we see that as in a lava lamp density / buoyancy affects the relative position of the liquids. A hot air balloon controls it&#39;s buoyancy to reach a new state of equilibrium at a different altitude.</p>

<p>All of the forces which we can actaully directly test are explainable through electromagnetism and density (which is really another expression of the electromagnetic force acting on the very small). We only need gravity to prove the theoretical.</p>

<p>Prove it. Do the experiment. If you really need me to challenge that specifically then you&#39;ve missed my larger point.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes&#39; experiment is pseudoscience and works on both models. Just think about it: Two six foot tall men stand under the same street lamp with no other light source. When the light hits them from the same angle they cast shadows of equal length. When one of them moves away, the shadow becomes longer. What Eratosthenes did was calculate the amount of curve required to cast a given shadow given that the sun is a very far away. He did not prove that model to be correct, he only calculated the curve for that model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. Density is merely the amount of compactness in a substance.</p>

<p>And in zero gravity what is the density of an unknown object, how would you find it? For objects to separate according to density there must be an attracting force. As I have said before mix oil and water and leave them in zero gravity (Whatever) even though the densities are different they will not separate. </p>

<p>Now consider this. Newton was brilliant but a little nutty. We can prove that magnetism attracts objects of opposite polarity. Lets run a very simple experiment to prove this. </p>

<p>Build a box that is EM shielded. These are pretty easy to make. Put an object in the box and measure the objects weight. An item in an EM shielded box behaves the same way as if it werent in that box. This means there must be a force attracting that is immune to EM shielding. </p>

<p>We can even take it a step further. Make this EM shielded box a vacuum. So we have no density conflicts and we have no EM therefore the item in the box should be weightless. Is it? No, again you could run this experiment yourself if you had the desire to do so. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, we see that as in a lava lamp density / buoyancy affects the relative position of the liquids. A hot air balloon controls it&#39;s buoyancy to reach a new state of equilibrium at a different altitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrt the pendulum, if you think the initial swing is enough​ to explain the behavior of a Foucault&#39;s pendulum, I would like to hear an actual explanation as that seems preposterous.</p>

<p>Wrt your sunset comment, I&#39;ll copy paste myself:</p>

<p>The numbers referenced are taken from the flat Earth society wiki, or calculated using those numbers.</p>

<p>The flat Earth model relies upon &quot;perspective&quot; to explain the sun and sunsets. I put that in quotes because they just don&#39;t understand perspective, yet reference it constantly to hand wave away issues.</p>

<p>The common flat Earth model has the sun orbiting in a circle parallel and above the plane of the earth by some 3-4000 miles (it really depends upon who you talk to. There&#39;s no real consensus and challenging them on a particular point results in a pivot of the argument)</p>

<p>This has several problems. The first being that the sun, being higher than any object on Earth should always be visible from anywhere on earth. At 3000 miles up, and, to put it as low in the sky as possible, a full circumference length of the round earth away (so basically standing on one edge of the earth and looking at the sun above the far edge of the earth opposite you), the sun will still be 6.88° above the horizon, and the angular size of the sun will be .07268°, just the tiniest dot, whereas directly above you, its angular size would be .61°, 8.39% larger, which is slightly larger than the angular size, .53°, listed on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The second being that because the sun is never below the horizon, if your view isn&#39;t obstructed by any foreground object with an angular height greater than 6.88°, then the sun should be visible.</p>

<p>Flat earthers have a variety of explanations for this, including the sun being a giant spotlight that doesn&#39;t shine on some parts even though it should otherwise be visible. As the sun is always a circle, even when setting, this is clearly not the case. Add in the sun still illuminating the sky well after it is no longer visible and the argument just falls apart.</p>

<p>Regardless of the shape of the sun being a sphere or a circle, it maintains a consistent size, with some variation for atmospheric effects, and being perceived as larger when near the horizon due to there being something to compare it to.</p>

<p>Frankly no self respecting flat earther would accept the results of any cartography expedition, as it is too easily manipulated by whatever sinister forces are responsible for the deception. This is a very simple argument that anyone with two eyes and the ability to apply basic reasoning can understand.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Such a pendulum is merely a ball and socket joint connected to a pendulum. Ball and socket joints facilitate circular momentum. The pendulum is set into motion by lifting and releasing the pendulum, however it is impossible to release it in a 100% straight motion. Over time this results is a slight circular motion. Moreover, pendulums rotating in opposite directions from the same hemisphere.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth Society is a shill organization meant to mislead people who only do superficial research into the subject by making claims such as : <em>gravity is cause by a constant upward motion by the earth</em> I&#39;m not here to defend there claims.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ortadoguendustri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Induction-Streetlights.jpg">Here</a> we see a row of street lights on a roughly flat road.

This is a crude example but it proves a point. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql_TTguKxnE">Here</a> we see a boat that is the highest point for miles around yet when we zoom out it becomes invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>I think you have the EPIC image confused with an older composite image. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Two things to add, whats the focal length of the lenses involved? The distances involved are also misleading. So that apollo photo showing a &quot;small&quot; earth was taken from 200k miles away from the moon itself using (Im pretty sure) standard old school 70mm film, Im not sure about the lens. </p>

<p>Now imagine that EPIC is nearly 1 million miles away taking a photo of the moon at nearly 800k miles away, the Earth is &quot;only&quot; 200k miles from the moon in that instance. </p>

<p>Heres an example <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8XEbF">http://imgur.com/a/8XEbF</a>  </p>

<p>I dont have audio at the moment so Im assuming this is the oblate spheroid thing? </p>

<p>It technically is... The center is slightly enlarged from the tidal forces, its not a &quot;perfect&quot; circle. </p>

<p>Why does NASA say it&#39;s not a globe or sphere?</p>

<p>Because of the combined effects of gravity and rotation, the Earth&#39;s shape is not quite a sphere but instead is slightly flattened in the direction of its axis of rotation. For that reason, in cartography the Earth is often approximated by an oblate spheroid instead of a sphere. The current World Geodetic System model uses a spheroid whose radius is 6,378.137 km (3,963.191 mi) at the equator and 6,356.752 km (3,949.903 mi) at the poles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not tying to be a dick, but you linked me to a page for a spheroid, which is a model that can be used to represent the Earth. There are a few models for the Earths shape. So if someone tries to prove the shape based off of the model, it can be done. Is that the source of the confusion? If it is then every post in here that&#39;s mocking flat Earth needs to have a reality check. You would see that you don&#39;t know science, because if you see someone proving a model wrong then it tells you that the model isn&#39;t 100% correct but nothing more. So one says flat the other says sphere, both models can&#39;t be totally right. There is an academic discipline studying this. </p>

<p>My main point is the amount of people who mock and call crazy someone when they don&#39;t know what the person is even saying. I mean people are saying &quot;round&quot; but flat earth thinks round. So mocking someone and calling them crazy for drawing the wrong conclusion from a model, shows that no one understood the other. I mean who knows what someone could figure out if we did science together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys always seem to dismiss the fact that the globe model has been established loooong before space industry and NASA existed. </p>

<p>And even today space industry is (by far) not the only branch involved in depending on the shape of the earth. What about sailors, cargo ships, pilots, geologists, civil engineers, geophysicists....? They can&#39;t be all in it, impossible. There would be more people in it than not, so it wouldn&#39;t be a conspiracy anymore.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say all those people are clearly not in it. To believe in globe earth when in reality it&#39;s flat, all of them would have to be fucking stupid not to see how their results differ from reality, every day and in every single detail. And still no one ever raised their voice about it? I think we can agree that&#39;s impossible, too.</p>

<p>So I hope you can draw your conclusion from that by yourself. Otherwise I&#39;m glad to help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cant see the curve from whatever height your drone can fly. Its even debatable what altitude people can/have seen the curve, with numbers ranging from 35,000-60,000 ft. Even at those altitudes its so subtle that its questionable. This is a big supportive argument for at least being open to flat earth as a thought experiment. Theres a lot that we <em>think</em> we see because its what we <em>expect</em> to see, when in fact we are not seeing it. Part of the FE thought process is the Zetetic Method, which relies on personal observation as opposed to trusting the theories and data previously laid out for us. In other words, most people only &quot;know&quot; the earth is round because its what theyve been taught, but have never questioned or examined for themselves. Its a valuable approach, as we&#39;re taught so many lies and manipulated by them. I respect that about FE inquiry. But FE theory is so flimsy and unable to answer certain questions that it doesnt hold up in the end, and I lose respect when members of that community are in denial about that part of it.  </p>

<p>No it does not. The amount of towers needed is astronomical. The deadzones would also be astronomical, as dense urban centers can hide the signal. Or just hills/valleys. </p>

<p>Except they do. GPS works by reception only. We don&#39;t know where planes go because they can&#39;t communicate to the outside world. Seriously, go to the coast and get into a fishing boat. How the fuck do you think large shipping liners, commercial fishing boats, or even smugglers, travel the seas? I&#39;ll wait. Yes, the stars are an option, but not perfect. And not viable on cloudy nights. </p>

<p>What about them? Also, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/hQ4mq">source?</a> I can&#39;t find shit. Or are you talking about Radio communication towers? In which case, what about them? </p>

<p>Also, you do know the ocean is huge right? If you claim that inland there&#39;s GPS loss. And the world is 3/4<sup>th</sup> ocean, how the fuck is there any GPS in the ocean? Or let me guess, every crew on every boat ever is in on the conspiracy. Same with Pilots, smugglers, etc. They just <strong>claim</strong> to use GPS, while actually are rocking sextants? </p>

<p>Lets look at historic examples. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1#Reaction">Sputnik 1</a>. The first satellite. It was visible by over 150 watch stations, and even more civilians. Detectable on short wave radio. It managed to do 1440 orbits, transmitted for 21 days, and was visible for 3 months. </p>

<p>Before you say plane, it was moving at 29 000Km/h, 8 times the speed of the SR-71 blackbird. and did an orbit every 96.2 minutes. </p>

<p>What&#39;s your explanation to this?</p>

<p>Satellite Internet packages can have somewhat decent speeds. Comparable to DSL. However, the Ping is garbage. Strangely enough, this ping is, somehow, just over the amount of time needed to send a signal ~71000 Kilometers. Half the height of a geostationary satellite&#39;s orbit height. Go to any farmer, or small town that only has Satellite internet packages and see for yourself. <a href="http://openspeedtest.net">http://openspeedtest.net</a> will give you ping. Unless you think that website designer is also in on it. </p>

<p>In a few years, Elon Musk will be doing global WiFi coverage with a mesh network of low altitude satellites. What&#39;ll be your excuse there?</p>

<p>You, my friend, are defending a ridiculous lie, and don&#39;t even know it. How can orbits not decay? If they do, how are the space station, and Hubble telescope, being so heavy, to remain at altitude? You are under a spell, and will pull an answer from the same place the Moonwalking Astronauts pulled a Dunebuggy out of. Unless you grow weary of being lied to, and begin to question your handlers. It&#39;s not that everyone is in on it, it is that everyone starts life under it - stacks and piles of falsehoods. It takes a while to muster courage to be skeptical. Like I said, give not a shit what fucking shape I live on. But I don&#39;t care to be misled, and am suspicious of professional liars like the ISS crew on their harnesses in front of their green screens. I&#39;m suspicious when a continent is off limits. When a plane goes missing so easily in the southern latitudes. When nobody has circumnavigated north-south. When flights only cross north of the equator to refuel and back, never south to north and back. When the U.N. flag 100% matches the flat earth society map. The Antarctic barrier, and all the &quot;southern hemisphere&quot; flight route inconsistencies suddenly make sense. There is much more, too. More of what should be undeniable cause for serious inquiry. Sources matter a lot when, considering the evidence, and the demonstrable intelligence of real people like me who are telling you to wake up. When you see others viciously attack the messenger as if they are Kidnapping and raping kids and whatever the real global elite reportedly tend to do now and in much of history. All I&#39;m saying is, the Earth is flat, based on my own investigation. It began after seeing the ISS is a lame hoax, and endless lies and fake shit from NASA. They insult our intelligence, but get major respect while I am told to commit suicide for broaching this topic from any angle to lend credence to the long-held traditional and orthodox view of all our ancestors. Flat earth is so despised, so reviled, so under- and mis-represented, it should be the first thing for anyone to want to debunk. And if so easily debunked, a map of the Flat Earth ought to be the last thing for powerful, mind-manipulating institutions of the world leaders to struggle against, get emotional about, and edify on their own flag. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/h5vOvkL.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/h5vOvkL.jpg</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SgqZMfO.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/SgqZMfO.jpg</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Sources matter a lot when, considering the evidence, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, and it also helps to understand what the source you&#39;re talking about means. The image you linked to is displayed on this webpage <a href="http://www.rigstat.com/Asset-Tracking-Service">http://www.rigstat.com/Asset-Tracking-Service</a>. It is a company that sells remote sensing products. These products collect data and GPS coordinates and then satellite phone that data to a server for logging. That map is showing their remote sensing systems data coverage capabilities. The map you linked is for the GlobalStar data service. There is also another map on that page for the Inmarsat&#39;s data service coverage which offers more coverage than GlobalStar. The map you linked in no way demonstrates the limits of GPS coverage to determine your position. In fact, I have been hiking in remote locations where under your assumed model of land based GPA signals reflecting off the firmament dome would still be impossible to receive a signal to determine location, yet I had more than 4 satellites available on my GPS unit and was able to safely navigate my waypoints.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the demonstrable intelligence of real people like me who are telling you to wake up. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen no such demonstration so far. I&#39;ll also add that being intelligent in no way leads one to come to correct conclusions. The process, the scientific method, is what&#39;s important. In fact, intelligent people can be better at convincing themselves of irrational beliefs. So far, I&#39;ve only seen you try to come to a predetermined conclusion on weak and poorly understood evidence. It looks like you started with a conclusion you wanted, googled it, and found an image that confirmed what you wanted, then your search stopped there with no further critical inquiry. You didn&#39;t even take the time to understand what you were looking at.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You, my friend, are defending a ridiculous lie, and don&#39;t even know it.</p>

<p>It takes a while to muster courage to be skeptical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, you haven&#39;t demonstrated it&#39;s a ridiculous lie or that you&#39;re engaging in skepticism. I&#39;ve asked in another thread for your best top 3 arguments but haven&#39;t heard anything. YOu said you had some scientific and engineering background, so I&#39;m interested in this thread and how you became convinced of a flat earth. But, so far I&#39;m unconvinced that you know what conducting science even looks like or how to be a skeptic. Being skeptical means questioning evidence, but it also means being aware of poor thinking traps humans fall into. You must be aware of logical fallacies and reliance on negative evidence humans are prone to do. So far, you have only offered negative evidence. I don&#39;t understand orbital mechanics, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence and a logical fallacy called argument from ignorance. The ISS seems fake, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence, argument from incredulity. I can&#39;t travel to Antarctica, therefore flat earth. Appeal to conspiracies. By the way, you don&#39;t have to be a scientist to travel to Antarctica, they require many support staff for the facilities that house the scientists to do their work. You could certainly take a temporary job there if you wanted to investigate for yourself. Continuing..., I don&#39;t understand how a plane could go missing over an ocean, therefore flat earth. Appeal to ignorance. Nobody has circumnavigated north to south, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence. Flights only cross north of the equator to refuel and back, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence. The UN flag matches the flat earth map, therefore flat earth. Appeal to coincidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how are the space station, and Hubble telescope, being so heavy, to remain at altitude?</p>

<p>Orbital mechanics and an occasional orbit boost. You can watch an orbit boost on ISS here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI8ldDyr3G0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI8ldDyr3G0</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is an argument from incredulity. Besides, you can spot ISS yourself with the naked eye, cheap binoculars, or if you&#39;re skilled, a cheap telescope. <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</a>. Others have done it and even produced photographs. <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/02/28/ridiculously-awesome-pic-of-discovery-and-the-iss-taken-from-the-ground/#.WRb-y_nyupo">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/02/28/ridiculously-awesome-pic-of-discovery-and-the-iss-taken-from-the-ground/#.WRb-y_nyupo</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A poor investigation? Have I really? I&#39;d like be the one to pass judgment on that, thank you very much. Like you said, I considered the sources. And that is key, as I&#39;m offering new, helpful concepts to you. You are feeding me evidence by NASA about NASA repeated over and over. </p>

<p>I was already at terms with the fact that I was made a fool for believing the absolute fucking nonsense that NASA puts out. I&#39;m trying to help you, so let&#39;s see if it&#39;s possible now:</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t agree, I will stop here, because you are not going to possess the discernment necessary to continue conversing with me. That is, you still believe the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>NASA went to the moon in that <a href="https://youtu.be/SSANJRMASII">piece of shit landing module</a>, and even took shrinkable dune buggies with them, just to ride around in, in between footage of landing and departing.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://youtu.be/U5_Il2tAT7U">Mars Rover landing</a> &quot;movie&quot; by NASA was a highly-technical mission, of highly-skilled experts, led by a genuine Engineer, who is a Leader, a gentleman, and a scholar. And they landed on mars. The pictures are of Mars, from Mars, and not Devon Island, B.C. Canada, where they do indeed secretly train for missions.</li>
</ol>

<p>DO you still consider NASA, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Elon Musk, etc. as reliable sources who don&#39;t lie, or wouldn&#39;t lie about satellites, space travel, and the shape of the Earth? </p>

<p>If no, you have taken an important step. Stop here, and go research. If yes, read on.</p>

<p>I just have to let you go and be a victim of their gaslighting, because I refuse to be a victim of your gaslighting. The cycle of manipulation and abusive intellectual deceit stopped for me a few months ago. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have all the answers, either- and may I remind you I cited my credentials in response to the O.P.&#39;s prejudicial, authoritarian, egocentric, and narcissistic attack on the thoughts/beliefs of others who deign to question something he has never seen with his own eyes either- a globe earth. I referenced my smarts, so that other people who believe in a Flat Earth can feel some support, and not so alone, and not so goddam abused by fucks like yourself. Therefore, take your smug, condescending r/Iamverysmart and shove it up your own ass, break it off, and shit it out sideways. Then go watch your NASA / Bill Nye cartoons of satellites, globes, and Ice cream cones using peer-pressure to have a bigger orgy.

<blockquote>
<p>because you are not going to possess the discernment necessary to continue conversing with me.</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t understand one of the most basic concepts of life. The world is round. You don&#39;t even need science to learn that. Watch a lunar eclipse and you can, and will, see the curvature of the earth. Considering you can see this curve from any point on the earth during an eclipse, how is the world not round?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have a physics degree. How are you to judge the landing module&#39;s materials? I know you have a big ego, but it is possible, that maybe. Just maybe, they know something you don&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and even took shrinkable dune buggies with them</p>

<p>They fold, and only weigh 500 pounds. I posted a photo before. </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re going to call bullshit, look at the videos where you see dust flying. Either from an astronaut, or the buggy itself. It does not behave like dirt on earth. It gets kicked up higher than it should, and acts as if its in a vacuum. Which would require a massive facility. </p>

<p>Why was it faked? At what point is it to hard for you to think it&#39;s faked.</p>

<p>Before you said that men on the moon is laughable because they couldn&#39;t crash a satellite into it 5 years prior. Did that happen in your books? If so, is a lauding impossible?

<p>Bill Nye has gone off the liberal deep end. </p>

<p>Elon Musk is a Capitalist, trusting him is hard. However his ambitions are pro-earth with attempts at decentralized power, which would lower dependence on the government. I don&#39;t see why anyone would hate him. His products are anti-government. </p>

<p>Explain all these with a flat earth model. Estimate the next Lunar eclipse with your model. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The only thing you&#39;re refusing to do is stay on topic, and answer questions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cycle of manipulation and abusive intellectual deceit stopped for me a few months ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you were born?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t have all the answers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t want all the answers. I want 13. If you don&#39;t have a rudimentary understanding as to how the universe works in your planetary model, then it&#39;s not accurate. You cannot accept that something exists without knowing why it exists. You&#39;re lacking answers, and are taking it on pure faith. You&#39;re no better than a Religious nut job saying that the world is 6000 years old. You&#39;re bastardizing science and ignoring simple concepts to take a pre-conceived notion and filling in the blanks around it. You are doing noting but making yourself look bad by not answering questions, or linking sources. You didn&#39;t even give a single personal mention to BN, NDT, Elon, etc. But rather bashed the lunar missions and the mars rover.</p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ll answer my own questions using the globular earth model. At least you&#39;ll have step 1. </p>

<ol>
<li>All large solid objects in space are round because of gravity pulling mass towards each other. </li>
<li>The round earth spins, causing the illusion of a moving sky. Since we&#39;re orbiting the sun slower than we spin, it also appears to move. </li>
<li>Because the earth is round. </li>
<li>NASA exists because space exploration is something that should exist. </li>
<li>The space Race happened because America and Russia needed to demonstrate their pinpoint missile targeting capabilities and payloads without actually killing each other. However it also doubled as a Capitalism / Communism battle. </li>
<li>No one is in on anything because there is no conspiracy reguarding the shape of the planet. </li>
<li>Airplane routes curve in the air to account for the curve of the globe. </li>
<li>See above. </li>
<li>Satellites are placed in orbit using orbital mechanics. I can explain to these if you can&#39;t understand them.</li>
<li>Gravity is a force that pulls matter together. </li>
<li>Tide goes in, tide goes out. It&#39;s explained easily by the moon&#39;s own gravity pulling on the earth. </li>
</ol>

<p>Your turn. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve never seen a lunar eclipse? Sad life you live bruv. Also, copy and paste is a rather easy process. How about you bring them back down. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I referenced my smarts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing bigger than the amount of people in on the flat earth conspiracy, is your ego. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so that other people who believe in a Flat Earth can feel some support</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is called an echo chamber. It has also lead to people on Tumblr thinking that all white people must die. This is not a good thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and not so alone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They should be alone. Same with the people who believe that pedophilia is ok because they&#39;re born that way. LGBTQP+ or whatever it is now. Soon it&#39;ll be a new damned alphabet. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to believe in crazy shit without proof, then you&#39;re going to get called on it. You haven&#39;t answered my question, and ignored the fact I proved you wrong about GPS coverage. You have not mentioned that once, and are changing the topic whenever pressed.

<p>Dude, have you read your own arguments? I can see the fedora on top of your comments. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>break it off, and shit it out sideways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>considering it&#39;s a subreddit, it&#39;s just digital data that doesn&#39;t really exist. </p>

<p>How about you stop shit talking and answer a damn question, or actually attempt to further a previous topic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then go watch your NASA / Bill Nye cartoons of satellites, globes, and Ice cream cones using peer-pressure to have a bigger orgy.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>The DoD is the one doing GPS. The system this argument started over. Not NASA. </li>
<li>Bill Nye has never been brought up in this argument until you did. And all of his more recent work is fueled by politics, not science. </li>
</ol>

<p>Let me make myself clear once again. GPS systems are global. Even in the middle of the ocean. How does the flat earth explain this concept? It&#39;s an easy concept. </p>

<p>However it can&#39;t be a dome. We know that it didn&#39;t exist in the ancient times, unless historians are hiding the fact because they to are in on it. And that it couldn&#39;t be built, since we&#39;d see it easily. </p>

<p>It also can&#39;t just be atmospheric bouncing of signals. since there&#39;d be a lot of dead zones. </p>

<p>It also can&#39;t be ground based since it&#39;d cost a fortune, and would be unusable in the ocean. </p>

<p>So, what is it then?</p>

<p>The fact that days are longer in the south during winters in the north, and longer in the north when it&#39;s summer. For that to happen on a flat earth it means the sun would have to light a wider area in winter, and smaller area in summer, not to mention it would have to move from tropic to tropic as it turned as the seasons changed.</p>

<p>This is much more simply explained by the earth being round and on a tilt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK psy grad student, see my post in this topic i just made. I mean tell me who is clinging to their beliefs? First, if someone sets out to prove the shape of the earth isnt a globe, they can do it, but they can then falsely conclude that the Earth is flat. So when you just read the literal academic discipline of science, you see that it isn&#39;t globe or flat, but thats where everyone gets hung up. See what NASA says in my link or read the history of the &quot;sphere earth&quot; and then you will understand.</p>

<p>gravity cant explain flat earth, the theory is therefore invalid, but even before that, i can send a balloon in the sky and see the curvature of the earth, i bet the higher up can fake this too, /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just checked Wikipedia:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=figure_of_the_Earth">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=figure_of_the_Earth</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The expression figure of the Earth has various meanings in geodesy according to the way it is used and the precision with which the Earth&#39;s size and shape is to be defined. While the sphere is a close approximation of the true figure of the Earth and satisfactory for many purposes, geodesists have developed several models that more closely approximate the shape of the Earth so that coordinate systems can serve the precise needs of navigation, surveying, cadastre, land use, and diverse other concerns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>For the historical development of the concept, see</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth">Spherical Earth</a> and Flat Earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Geodetic data[edit source]
Because geodetic point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained in a system that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a geodetic datum: a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of choosing conventional coordinate values for one or more datum points.</p>

<p>In the case of height data, it suffices to choose one datum point: the reference bench mark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical data like the NAP (Normaal Amsterdams Peil), the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and so on.</p>

<p>In case of plane or spatial coordinates, we typically need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like ED 50 can be fixed by prescribing the undulation of the geoid and the deflection of the vertical in one datum point, in this case the Helmert Tower in Potsdam. However, an overdetermined ensemble of datum points can also be used.</p>

<p>Changing the coordinates of a point set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a datum transformation. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values. In the case of plane or spatial coordinates, datum transformation takes the form of a similarity or Helmert transformation, consisting of a rotation and scaling operation in addition to a simple translation. In the plane, a Helmert transformation has four parameters; in space, seven.</p>

<p>A note on terminology[edit source]
In the abstract, a coordinate system as used in mathematics and geodesy is, e.g., in ISO terminology, referred to as a coordinate system. International geodetic organizations like the IERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service) speak of a reference system.</p>

<p>When these coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO uses the terminology coordinate reference system, while IERS speaks of a reference frame. A datum transformation again is referred to by ISO as a coordinate transformation. (ISO 19111: Spatial referencing by coordinates).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could clear up many misconceptions here: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The study of geodesics on an ellipsoid arose in connection with geodesy specifically with the solution of triangulation networks. <strong>The figure of the Earth is well approximated by an oblate ellipsoid, a slightly flattened sphere.</strong> A geodesic is the shortest path between two points on a curved surface, i.e., the analogue of a straight line on a plane surface. The solution of a triangulation network on an ellipsoid is therefore a set of exercises in spheroidal trigonometry .</p>
</blockquote>

As far as gravity, you completely missed it.  We can measure directly the magnetic field around the earth that comes directly from the molten nickle core that is our center.  It&#39;s spherical.

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s very sad with the topic... it can leads to a lot of philosophical discussions but as soon as you say more than &quot;it&#39;s bullshit&quot; you&#39;re instantly tagged &quot;idiot&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting on how science is sharing traits with religions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting on how even scientists are defining their models, sometimes forcing fitting new observations into the current model, and sometimes redefining the model itself, depending on how strong their current beliefs and/or expectations are.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting in how people react to it, because it actually shows that a big &quot;they don&#39;t want us to know&quot; conspiracy would totally be doable.

<p>That&#39;s why the topic is interesting on a philosophical level :) At some point, you have to &quot;trust&quot; science from your own ignorant point of view.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also no official code of ethics for science to keep people from falsifying experiments/results knowing that essentially nobody is likely to check their work (nor could we really expect that all scientists would follow the code even if there were one).<br/>
A good example being the <em>&quot;cannabis kills brain cells&quot;</em> experiment.<br/>
For decades we believed (and our schools taught) that cannabis kills brain cells. The reality is that the experiment involved forcing animals to breath so much cannabis smoke that they simply couldn&#39;t breath air; they couldn&#39;t get enough oxygen so brain cells started dying.<br/>
For decades nobody bothered to re-conduct the experiment or even check how the experiment was conducted.<br/>
There truly is a new religion forming with universities and other &#39;trusted&#39; organizations of the mainstream academic/scientific communities serving as the divine institutions, and anyone with a white lab coat and a degree in some field of science as an ordained priest.<br/>
I regularly come across college kids who get angry and call people &#39;anti-science&#39; for even simply questioning certain things that they&#39;ve been told are facts by the divine institutions and the white coat priests.<br/>
Just as Christians assumed their black-robed priests were right because they were guided by god, these college kids assume their white coat priests are right because there&#39;s some uncorruptible ethical organization somewhere making sure all of their experiments and results are legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In 1901, Henry Yule Oldham, a geography reader at King&#39;s College, Cambridge, reproduced Wallace&#39;s results using three poles fixed at equal height above water level. When viewed through a theodolite (a precision instrument for measuring angles), the middle pole was found to be almost three feet (0.91 m) higher than the poles at each end.[10][11] This version of the experiment was taught in schools until photographs of the Earth from space became available.[12][13]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I say somewhere I believe the Earth is flat ?</p>

<p>The point of my comment was to tell that it&#39;s not THAT easy to be sure of it for the lambda ignorant average joe. Even his legit experimentations could lead to fallacious results due to some more ignorance (atmospherical refraction, duh).</p>

<p>Thus, at some point, and from the average joe point of view again, you have to &quot;believe&quot; in science which makes it share some traits with religions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s part of why people can get so mad on the topic, because it questions their core beliefs and they don&#39;t really have tools to defend themselves besides &quot;it&#39;s like this&quot; or &quot;everybody knows this&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree,</p>

<p>Research papers (should) include enough information for you to repeat the experiment to achieve the same results. A lot of science is repeating experiments to prove accuracy. There is nothing stopping you from repeating any experiment you want. The fact that you don&#39;t is not a knock against the conclusions drawn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right... but if i haven&#39;t repeated the experiment, then the &quot;facts&quot; are really just second hand information, and not &quot;knowledge&quot; that I possess.  I&#39;m aware that some people take experiments as 100% fact, but I don&#39;t accept that.  There are errors, misdrawn conclusions, confirmation bias, ulterior motives, etc. to take into account.</p>

<p>All I am saying is that what we think we know, we don&#39;t know for sure.  A lot of the &quot;facts&quot; from the past are known to be false now.  What makes this day and age so special?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mass repeatability makes this day and age so special. You publish a study and 3 or 4 other groups of people are going to try and replicate it HOPING for failure.</p>

<p>Again, they way you talk is simply not how you live your life. You take for true 1000&#39;s of little pieces of science as fact. You are using a computer, yet I am pretty sure you havent &quot;conducted an experiment&quot; showing how electronic memory works, or capacitance. </p>

<p>Again...just because you haven&#39;t done something doesn&#39;t make it nefarious or untrue. The laws of nature don&#39;t care about your feelings on them.</p>

<p>This all started with the weird &quot;oil is the blood of the planet&quot; comment. If you have no evidence of your thesis, then your thesis is meaningless is it not?</p>

<p>Science, usually, attempts to answer a specific question. If your question was does paper burn, and paper burns, then you have answered your question. If I write a paper saying that and you read it, I believe you shouldn&#39;t dismiss it without reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people need to do their research, when it&#39;s been proven time and time again? You can see it in nature, as I just said in another comment, look at a sunset, you know that the horizon of the earth blocks the sun from your view, you can visualize how this works on a spherical model, as the earth rotates the side away from the sun loses light. Try doing this on a flat plane and tell me how you replicate a sunset while also providing light to another location, it just doesn&#39;t work. My point is we&#39;ve been told the earth is round because it is, and anyone can see it by just using logic. The earth was once considered flat, but then some smart started to realize that a flat Earth just wasn&#39;t consistent with their observations in nature. If someone tells me I&#39;m a sheep because I believe what I&#39;m told versus investigating myself then I do find that offensive. I&#39;m sure there are people who do believe the earth is round because that&#39;s all they&#39;ve ever been told but couldn&#39;t prove it, but that doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that smarter men than I have proved it, and it&#39;s very easy to prove myself. It&#39;s like knowing the spoiler of a movie before watching it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of people do have everyday experience that indicates the Earth isn&#39;t flat, though.</p>

<p>People point a satellite dish into the sky and received a TV signal from a geostationary satellite.</p>

<p>People flying to multiple continents end up back home having only flown West or only flown East.</p>

<p>People visibly observe the ISS pass over them repeatedly on a consistent schedule.</p>

<p>Of course, when these points are brought up, flat-Earthers tell you your personal observations are deceiving you due to a bigger conspiracy at play. Satellite dishes are actually pointing to a giant, somehow invisible, tower, that&#39;s actually as tall as a satellite would be flying. Airlines are in on the conspiracy for some reason and the flight paths are fake. The ISS is just a drone flying on repeat/holographic projection. </p>

<p>At some point, you might as well just believe you&#39;re in a vat connected to the Matrix, given how unreliable you have to believe the world around you is to be a flat-Earther.</p>

<p>a good lesson to learn from this flat earth thing is to step back and reevaluate just how open minded you yourself are.</p>

<p>im not saying you need to believe in everything, but if anyone reading this jumps on flat eathers and thinks to themselves how ridiculous it is to believe in it they need/should also step back and realize that feeling they just experienced is the same one people who think antivaxxers or 911 truthers are dumb.</p>

<p>on the flip side, if you believe in a conspiracy that others think is crazy maybe also step back and at least educate yourself on the reasoning behind why people believe in one thing or another.</p>

<p>I personally dont believe in the flat earth, but I find the reasoning behind the theory extremely interesting/intriguing even if it requires some leaps to work (global conspiracy, etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See when the topic gets derailed because of the nature of the topic itself?  When people start resorting to calling people idiots and nothing gets discussed or dealt with at all?</p>

<p>This is part of that intention.  Entirely a waste of time.  Talk about the association of the topic and soon the topic is debated and the spiral starts again, achiveing exactly what it is supposed to.  Disruption and delays in the transfer of real information between people.</p>

<p>I still believe flat earth is not a real conspiracy, its a belief and it would need to be proven in any capacity before it could be regarded as a conspiracy to keep us ignorant of X or Y, and as such it shouldn&#39;t be allowed here.  Mostly because there is zero science behind it, but clearly used as a tool to do exactly that, make the entire group it comes into contact with look like fools as well.  Guilt by association.</p>

<p>They should have their own sub by now and can discuss the crap out of it there.  I proposed that a while ago and was attacked for wanting &quot;censorship&quot; but that&#39;s not what this would be.  Obviously I can&#39;t actually prevent people from thinking its real, but I don&#39;t believe it should be here at all.  They can have their time in another sub and people can go to them if they like.  It is <em>NOT</em> a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Siiiiiiiiigghh.... Okay flat earth can easily be debunked. I agree with you op, there are true conspiracies that are being discredited because of flat earth insanity.</p>

<p>I went to sea school about five years ago, so that I could acquire a 100 ton masters license. I was successful in acquiring my license. While I was at school, we had to learn about all aspects of navigation. One of the things we learned was about the curvature of the earth. We had to be able to determine the distance of a vessel on the horizon. We did this with this equation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/distance.htm">1.17 times the square root of your height of eye = Distance to the horizon in nautical miles</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For an example, say I&#39;m in the wheel house of a vessel, and my height of eye is around 20 feet. That would put any object on the horizon, approximately 5.2 nautical miles away.</p>

<p>Anyone can try this.
Also we reside in a simulation, but the earth is spherical in shape in this simulated reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it does look curved to me. There are also very noticeable arcs in the color gradient from the sun. If it was flat they would be linear gradients. </p>

<p>Also, because even in the video it looks curved, I paused the video and took out a piece of paper. I put it level with the center of the video at the edge of the horizon. The earth did not line up with the paper man. It was below the edge on both ends of the paper. Not a h get amount but enough to suggest it is in fact arced.</p>

<p>I feel like you chose a bad video or something because this wasn&#39;t conclusive at all. It actually showed the opposite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude that video is complete bullshit. It&#39;s edited for one thing, and then you have to trust what the youtuber&#39;s claim to how many miles away the vessel is. Also, the camera being used is absolutely horrible. I&#39;m so sick of this disinformation. I have spent countless hours looking at vessels traveling towards me and away from me. When navigating a boat, I use my binoculars constantly. Day and night, (they help tremendously to tell what the lights in a vessel are and help when navigating a channel, no matter the time). When looking through binoculars you can still see a vessel on the horizon disappearing or appearing according to which direction they&#39;re traveling. I have seen this hundreds of times. If you&#39;re getting closer to a vessel, fist you see the mast, then you&#39;ll see the house, then finally the hull and entire vessel come into view. So, I&#39;ll drop another mic here. I don&#39;t believe the earth is a sphere, because of what science tells me. Although I do trust many things that science has taught us. I know the earth is spherical in shape, because I have witnessed it first hand many many times. You could do the same test yourself. Go to your nearest body of water, get some binoculars, pull out your trusty smart phone, pull up the GPS, figure out how far you are from any object on shore and convert it to nautical miles, travel until the object is on your visual horizon according to your height of eye, figure out your height of eye, take the same smart phone you are holding, figure out the square root of your height of eye, multiply that by 1.17, match that with  A GPS distance, and shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit THE EARTH! IT IS A ROUND!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me what is wrong about the lines on the globe that he drew? I mean he drew a logical line from one point to another on a round globe model (doing this already introduces natural curve vertically which is the only curve that matters when flying in a straight line from point a to point b). Please demonstrate how he should have drawn the line if he did it incorrectly. Also explain why the flight paths work out perfectly on a flat Earth map. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Replying with a factual, non-snarky comment.</p>

<p>The shortest path on a sphere is not the straight line that we typically think of.  Marking two points on a globe and then drawing a line from one to the other is not the shortest path.  The shortest path is always an arc.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/great-circle-mapper.html?route=RCTP-KLAX&amp;amp;aircraft=232&amp;amp;speed=">This</a> is the actual path that planes travel and it&#39;s a 12-hour trip.  Alaska is a perfectly reasonable destination.</p>

<p>How can you chose to ignore such obvious facts when forming your view that the earth is flat?  That&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand.  I&#39;m sure I could debunk those other videos you posted, but when you start off with something so completely devoid of the truth, I lose all motivation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I followed this crazy thread from some post somewhere off the front page. I&#39;m curious, I thought the arc was it literally flying up into the air. Why do the planes fly north? I know that from EU to USA some airlines have direct flight access while others go over Canada and the flight took like two extra hours. So I don&#39;t see the arc benefit in speed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This leads one down the path to solipsism. </p>

<p>Sure we can have a debate about NASA but a flat earth would require millions of people to be in on it in some fashion. All space agencies, all aeronautical engineers, most boat captains, all the worlds armies, shit even the guy who punches in the numbers to calculate how much fuel your plane will need, all astronauts, all astrophysicists, anyone involved with satellite manufacture, same with any kind of hardware designed for space, the list goes on and on. </p>

<p>Yeah sure the moon landing could be far more controlled because what are you going to do? Go to the moon and check (this is an aside from the mirrors humans left there, you could for a fairly nominal price bounce a signal off of it)? But we lilve on this planet and no one has ever seen this ice wall? No one has ever shown me a guy eating fish and chips smoking a fag talking about fanny on the shores of the UK from NYC.</p>

<p>Honest question: Do you think computers are fake and or magic? </p>

<p>Seriously have you ever seen an electron move through a circuit board? How do you know thats how they work? You just took someones word for it. Do you really think a HDD is spinning at 7200 RPM with a read write head floating 1/10 the width of a  human hair above it in a completely clean sealed case reading on and off states so fast that we cant comprehend them? </p>

<p>Computers are magic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Removed the insult only because I remembered it violates a rule. And that is not at all what I was talking about. I am talking about flights that do NOT land at Antarctica (obviously). Look up a map of commercial flight paths, none of them are allowed to fly above or too close to the south pole - it is a part of the Antarctic treaty.</p>

<p>BTW, here are a couple of videos proving that flight paths make more sense on a flat earth map than the Mercator Projection that everyone subscribes to:</p>

<p>Lol and not because it was uncalled for? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is no reason to its not a viable flight path. There are parts of the ocean where planes dont fly, do you think they are also hiding things there? </p>

<p>As for how flights work on FE I recommend look up how they calculate fuel consumption for flights. The calculation literally involves curvature. Do you think that no one ever has noticed these calculations are wrong? Not a single flight mechanic, airforce pilot, member of the ground crew, logistics officers, oil companies have ever noticed this formula is incorrect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have been programmed to believe the truth is dumb. Brainwashed from childhood, separated from the truth. NASA is a psyop and their job is to make you believe the Earth is an insignificant little speck of dust in the universe, and that all of this is by chance; no place for God in this worldview. The truth is that Earth is flat, motionless, and the center of the universe.</p>

<p>The Bedford levels experiment proves that oceans do not curve around a globe. Michelson-morley experiment proves Earth does not spin. Airys failure proves its the stars that move, not Earth. Sagnac experiment disproves special relativity. CMB radiation proves geocentricity. But they won&#39;t teach you these experiments in school. Instead they&#39;ll teach you the big bang theory, theory of evolution, theory of gravity - and they teach these theories as facts.</p>

<p>None of us flat earthers wanted this shit to be true, because it makes us look retarded. I thought flat earthers were morons too, until i watched some of their videos and realized they make great points. <em>ALL flat earthers start out trying to disprove flat earth</em>, but the more one investigates, the clearer the deception becomes. Be skeptical of everything you see, even me. Good start down the rabbit hole would be Eric Dubay&#39;s 200 flat earth proofs video. Or just swallow the blue pill and forget about what i said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is exactly what these astroturfers and NGOs who pay them are trying to discourage - by attacking the anonymous internet user&#39;s pride so that they won&#39;t want to look into flat earth, they won&#39;t want to be that kind of person that is criticized for such a silly idea that can be debunked very easily... they don&#39;t want to give themselves to it or risk adopting it out of fear of social rebuke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are saying makes sense, but I&#39;ll say something I&#39;ve said a couple of times in the past.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories can be dangerous, never stop living your own life and hanging out with the people you love, never mix the conspiracies with your own reality.</p>

<p>Basically, even if you are reading that the world is weirder than you thought, don&#39;t forget your reality is your loved ones and the activities you do.</p>

<p>If you feel conspiracy reading is becoming a full time job, stop and look for an activity that will help you.</p>

<p>I picked up boxing and been doing it for the last couple of months, now when I get pissed for some conspiracy I take it out in training and come home with only love for my family.</p>

<p>I believe some people fall deep into the rabbit hole and it&#39;s very hard to get out of there with a sane mind if you don&#39;t work in understanding your own reality.</p>

He was laid of recently and suddenly believes in flat earth, knows when the second coming of Christ will be (down to the day), and thinks that all of the presidents have descended from King John of England.

    <div class="md"><p>watch the links, do the scientitic experiments your self (8 inches per mile squared) and you will see how easy it is to prove the earth is 100% flat. I would have never thought i would ever say something lie this, but if you actually look at it with an open mind (and with good understanding of the globe model) you will see it immediatly.</p>

<p>The attack on Flat Earth is very huge and organized, there is a good reason for that. Majority of Flat Earthers are NOT religious not cases, most of them examined the evidence themselves and were forced to accept that it shows the earth to be flat. This does raise the possibility of a creator (for me as well even though i was one of the biggest evolution and globe earth fans out there) but non of the thousands of flat earth friends on facebook i have will tell you its the same creator in the bible or quran or whatever. Only a few flat earthers do so because &quot;the bible says so&quot; and those are not better that people who blindly believe the globe with out investigating it first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is MY conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>What if there are paid trolls from the FBI and CIA and NSA. And websites started getting too close to the truth on some issue. Aliens, global bankers, Mk ultra, who knows. </p>

<p>So they hire trolls to take everything too far.</p>

<p>Is HAARP doing some weird ass research? You betcha! Are they triggering earthquakes in the ocean? Yeah maybe not. Maybe that&#39;s a dumb theory to cover up what they&#39;re really doing.</p>

<p>Operation bluebird, etc, show the history of deception.</p>

<p>I honestly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of the fringe has been fully taken over.  I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if lots of folks are having a gag and that the few who genuinely believe it don&#39;t realize that their brethren are leasing then astray</p>

<p>Also,people are dumb and want to think they&#39;ve discovered a truth few have</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are, man. The shilling <em>does</em> go that deep.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time studying human psychology lately, as a means of understanding the psychos that run the world. We&#39;ve heard several times that TPTB are, literally, psychopaths. Narcissists, sociopaths, beings who live through the paradigm of ego, rather than heart. </p>

<p>When you really start to understand a narcissist, and how wickedly they perceive reality, it makes sense that TPTB tend to be &quot;leaders&quot;, child rapists, and satanic occult worshippers. Bear with me, I&#39;ll make my point in a second.</p>

<p>Why are they leaders? They have the uncanny ability to manipulate. Within the consciousness of a narcissist is a profound ego. The ego isn&#39;t just the bad aspect of the mind, which many people believe. Rather, the ego is the entire mind, itself. The ego is the thought mechanism, or the thing for which thought is thinking. An imprint, if you will, on your conscience, through which your mind makes all of its decisions for &#39;you&#39;. TPTB are narcissistic, meaning they cannot relate, empathetically, to humanity. They only live for the self. These kinds of people can often find themselves in positions of power <em>because</em> they are such profound liars. To live in a materialistic world and to have a narcissistic ego is almost always going to put that particular person on a greedy, self-centered path. And how to we make money in this world without being naturally gifted in the arts or math or whatever? You have to be able to manipulate.</p>

<p>A narcissist is someone who, for example, has a girlfriend that he wants to have sex with. Yet, his girlfriend isn&#39;t in the mood. Rather than thinking, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s cool. No big deal. Maybe another night,&quot; a narcissist would likely pretend that he is <em>totally cool</em> with being not given what he wants. Yet, on the inside, he is fuming. He might, then, choose a TV show for them to watch that has a bunch of sexual themes in it, so as to turn her on. Or, he&#39;ll make subtle sexual jokes as a means of just getting &#39;sex&#39; on her mind. He&#39;ll suggest that they give each other massages and subtly let his hands go to the more sensitive parts of her body. And if she catches onto his intent, he will be triggered and insist that <em>she</em> is losing her mind. I only know this so intimately because one of my own parents was a full-blown narcissist. </p>

<p>These people are also participating, incessantly, in manipulative thoughts. We can think of thoughts as electric impulses, either positive or negative. So, if you spend an entire life as the manifestation of manipulation, you are spending an awful lot of time in the &#39;dark&#39; thought spectrum. Consequently, it makes sense to me that such people develop the most wicked obsessions, like pedophilia. Pedophilia is a turn on for pedophiles because, deep deep deep down, they are getting off to the concept of raping innocence. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so fucking mind blowing that society is slowly embracing the idea of normalizing pedophilia. There is no more wicked crime. It&#39;s demonic.</p>

<p>Which leads me to why these mf&#39;ers must participate in demonic occult activity. &#39;The Devil&#39; might not exist, but the manifestations of negative energy certainly do. And because these sickos have chosen the dark path, consciously or not, they are drawn to the ultimate forms of evil. Some people can awaken out of narcissism by realizing that, their entire lives, they have put all their energy into participating in negativity and participating in &#39;the self&#39;, rather than other. Most narcissists aren&#39;t even conscious of their wickedness, like my own parent, because it is so authentically who they are. </p>

<p>But, the reason I write this all, is really just to open peoples&#39; eyes to the fact that, because TPTB <em>are</em> narcissists and psychopaths, they <em>are</em> hugely clever. They know how to manipulate. They understand human body language and what humans are likely thinking based on how they look or move. They know what we love. They know what we hate. They know how we think. They know what we probably <em>will</em> think. And because of that ability, they feed us somewhat convincing theories -- not saying Flat Earth is convincing to the common intellectual, but it seems plenty of people have bought in hardcore -- that they know will spread like wildfire as a means of putting us off the path of truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earthers  rely only on senses. Especially vision. Our senses are dull compared to many animals. They don&#39;t believe in science. So that would mean all tests for proof would be denied by them. Principals of Pyhisics and other sciences would of course be denied. However no can deny optical illusions exist. If a flat Earthers would agree that senses alone cannot be a proof of a flat Earth. Then maybe they would agree that it&#39;s possible for the Earth to be round. 
Also do the sun, moon and other planets exist? Or are they illusions in the night sky.? Are they round, rectangular or otherwise? 
Is earth the only flat Planet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think the problem is rather simple.  People by and large do no understand science, it is a methodology, a way of understanding.  It is extremely unlikely to achieve anything with a mindset of disproving concepts or uncovering the truth.  Science is a methodology of observing reality, attempting to explain how things happen, testing our ideas rigorously, allowing others to have all of our information and ask them to justify our results.  People have achieved so much since adopting this methodology, those that do not are bound to continue arguing over long settled issues such as the shape of the planet.  </p>

<p>Indulging the conversation too much just gives the notion traction and visibility to others less discerning.</p>

<p>These are strange.</p>

<p>There is no way the Internet/humanity should be discussing something this simple in 2017.</p>

<p>Just feels like a waste of time.</p>

<p>A good way to drum up a disdain for anyone who expresses any kind of spiritual views though.</p>

<p>Just seems like a great way to divide and conqer, while distracting and at the same time sapping off support for other concepts such as the awakening itself.</p>

<p>They are attempting to get people to distance themselves from each other and certain notions by attaching them to something irrational.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t know ANYONE in real life who brings this this topic up to do anything except complain about those who believe in it.</p>

<li>The rejection of reasoned argument</li>

<li>Increasingly hostile &#39;arguments&#39; which typically rely on peer corroboration, abuse and slander</li>

<p>Are we looking at an organized crime effort to terraform our society and shift the thinking of the public via complicit personnel?  Why or why not?</p>

<p>Bonus: If this kind of effort is an organized conspiracy for subversion, it&#39;s comparatively new for it to be making such drastic attempts to cause direct results - conspiracies usually prefer to remain subtle, hidden and therefore undetected.

<p>And like someone else said above, why are there so many anti FE and no pro where Earth posts? See like that theory really gets to people. These posts always sounds like an outsider talking to a conspiracy theorist, you just say it&#39;s crazy and that we need to accept the truth.

    <div class="md"><p>You would ask for me giving evidence. So shouldn&#39;t you let the flat earthers come with evidence? Haven&#39;t the flat earthers got any motives (like religion), they haven&#39;t seen it either, so on what basis do they claim they do have the knowledge and autority to say something. 
Flat earthers  haven&#39;t given any proof. The most they have done is state that some prove of a spherical earth can also be seen when it is flat. Never have they proven that the earth is flat. They wring themselves in all kind of awkward positions, to hold on to that view. Sure I can believe individual arguments, but if you zoom out and see the total picture vs. the earth is round, you should be able to see that the earth is round (a sphere that is). </p>

<p>Where is the picture of the actual edge of the world? Nowhere. We can say it is being hold back, we can also just think objectively here and conclude there is no photo because there is no edge. </p>

<p>There is a difference between not trusting someone and distrusting them per definition. I think anyone who is aware of the fact that people can lie to other people, has to do it&#39;s own factfinding. That doesn&#39;t mean if the government says the earth is round you have to believe it is square or flat untill you see with your own eyes it&#39;s a sphere. That&#39;s just stupid. Also, the government has nothing to do with this, because it&#39;s been centuries that great thinkers and scientists have found that the earth is a sphere.  Back in the days the government hang people that said otherwise.
That being sad most flat earthers are religious people. If there is anything that shouldn&#39;t be believed because of the reasons you adressed it&#39;s religion.</p>

<p>Believing in conspiracies, not trusting someone because they have autority, and finding the truth on your own is a good thing, but to much of a good thing, distrusting per definition and letting emotions come into play and you&#39;ve got yourself a flat earther.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By my logic, there was a time when nobody knew anything. Then they knew how to make telescopes, and they started to learn more about the world and what&#39;s around it. This is not trust, that&#39;s something different, because with trust, you shouldn&#39;t question, you shouldn&#39;t think. I can think and question, and know for sure that the earth is a sphere. As I stated, you&#39;re talking with emotion.</p>

<p>How are you sure you&#39;re not in a simulation, and all history, all your memories, everything is just a part of that simulation, that never even happened. There are some interesting theories about that. I think we can never be fully sure about anything. That doesn&#39;t mean the opposite is true, because we don&#39;t know that either.</p>

<p>There are reasons to believe (atleast) a part of Shakespeare&#39;s writing is not his. So no I am not sure.
I fear I&#39;m not going to convince you, and that&#39;s okay. Atleast we could exchange our thoughts.</p>

You have rich and powerful and you have slaves (like now) so for you to say nobody knew anything is saying that now we are far superior as a society than back in Roman time, but if you look at it we are pretty much the same , yea we got iPads but we act and have the same social structure and struggles as somebody form that time....

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s not fair. You&#39;re taking my statement far too literal. But I have to admit it was oversimplefied. There have been great cultures with great knowledge. However, knowledge is not a cumulative thing, knowledge can be lost. The point I tried to make is that both sides of the argument have been supported by autorities, nothing more. 
I never stated social and societal structures where different back in the day, hence also my statement that people were hung because of their opinions. </p>

<p>What is trust? Some say the earth is a sphere, and others say it&#39;s a disc, if i don&#39;t trust both of them, does that mean I can&#39;t think the earth is a sphere, nor that it is a disc? If I trust noone, does that mean I can&#39;t have an opinion? Can I only believe in what I have absolutely seen myself? If that&#39;s the case, how much farther have I come than the first men? </p>

<p>The discussion depends on the definition of trust. Does trust mean you choose to believe something that you have not seen with your own eyes, or does trust mean that after all information, and the structures around it have been analysed, I choose to accept an explanation as the truth (untill there is reason to change that view)? Thruth and trust, even the words are similar. What do we absolutely 100% surely know? There have been many interesting discussions about this. (Will search for a link in a sec)</p>

<p>I trust no autority, but I trust some information, because we all do, we have too. Does that mean I will never be 100% right, yes it does. But when you know nothing, how many percent right are you? I do always interpret information, weigh the motives, see why they could be wrong, so I never take anything for a fact because someone said so. But in the end I have to choose something, and then we come back to wether the earth is round or flat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Up to a couple of years ago I thought the whole UFO-thing was a bunch of nonsense. I was very wrong. There are many high-ranking witnesses that have come forward.</p>

<p>A good starting point would be to check the Disclosure Project on youtube:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhNHIEPCKE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhNHIEPCKE</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud49Gh9yYLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud49Gh9yYLs</a></p>

<p>Then when it comes to the secret space program, I would advise to see lectures by Richard Dolan:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buNCOlB-HeM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buNCOlB-HeM</a></p>

<p>Another great vid to watch is about the Fluxliner advanced propulsion aircraft:

Anyone ever notice how when a thread blows up to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, the top posts are almost exclusively with a crazy number of upvotes debunking whatever the thread is in reference to? You could say &#39;well it&#39;s because all of Reddit is seeing it now and they&#39;re coming in&#39;, except that shit rarely happens with any other subreddit like, say, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/CringeAnarchy">/r/CringeAnarchy</a>, etc. Their communities downvote people they would regularly disagree with, but somehow in this subreddit, the exact opposite happens.

I taught science before becoming an Inventor now running a successful startup. I don&#39;t think that this matters, because I had all that years ago. I recently became a believer in that flat earth thing. It is reviled. But if you investigate it with an honest and open mind you will see that it has merit. </p>

<p>How could I have not seen it before? It is so obvious that everything about space has been faked. If you don&#39;t see that the ISS is a hoax you are under some serious hypnosis. It&#39;s a laughable, poorly executed fraud. Rockets fall 100% back down in 10 minutes after being launched, you can see it with your own eyes. Satellites are not real, look into GPS. I investigated it. Every single contention regarding flatness and an impenetrable firmament above has proven out. I investigated for myself, you should investigate for yourself, but most of you won&#39;t. </p>

<p>I searched for NASA&#39;s official pictures supposedly taken as real photos of the ISS. Then I examined it.</p>

<p>I did it again and again. Fake shit, lies.</p>

<p>Space shuttle? Fakery. Fucking look at it you guys! Snap out of their fucking spell! They lie right in your face and you eat it up. I did too, but now I&#39;m ashamed I wasn&#39;t a flat Earther before now.</p>

<p>Space, satellites, optics, everything is fakery and managed to hide the flat earth, and firmament.</p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as if some witchcraft has put a spell on us. Only a few of us can actually break the spell. The mind control from birth is some powerful psychological warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMAO. Like the other guy said, getting a patent doesn&#39;t mean anything. This is just hilarious, finally I&#39;m lolling really hard. And it really triggers me because of a personal experience:</p>

<p>I knew a guy personally, jobless and uneducated, who thought to have a great idea (although it wasn&#39;t) and even he got a patent. I saw it. He had to spend some thousand dollars for it; money he didn&#39;t have, so he borrowed it from friends. Couldn&#39;t pay it back, of course. Because his patent and his idea turned out to be worthless nonsense. Much trouble with his friends followed. Still jobless, btw, but working on the next big thing.</p>

<p>So much on having a patent, Mr. &quot;physicist&quot;. But at least I understand why you call yourself a physicist: As the known science is all fake, you watched some YouTube videos with &quot;true science&quot; so it&#39;s legit to call yourself that way. Newton, Einstein and Galileo can consider themselves as debunked, no doubt.</p>

Have you ever looked at any of the planets through a telescope? They are spheres. Look at Jupiter for example, it is plainly simple to discover with a cheap telescope that it is a sphere orbited by moons. We know gravity exists, why wouldn&#39;t earth&#39;s mass be pulled into a sphere like the other planets? Why is there a conspiracy to hide a flat earth? For what purpose?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know... this is the point.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched some of the videos, and the question I ask myself isn&#39;t &quot;is it flat&quot; or &quot;is it round&quot; but rather &quot;what can I actually believe?&quot;</p>

<p>So maybe I am nuts for even asking the question, but goddammit, I cannot prove it either way, I am here on this earth, and will possibly never get the birds-eye view to prove this argument either way.  Some of the youtube arguments for a flat earth are pretty convincing.</p>

<p>The tough thing is that we are so deeply entrenched in our beliefs (whatever they may be) that we have a VERY hard time seeing any other possibility.</p>

<p>Maybe this thing is flat.  Maybe it&#39;s spheoroid, maybe it&#39;s not at all... I do not know, I may never know.</p>

<p>And while I don&#39;t claim any sort of genius status, I am no idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check my comment history; y&#39;all need to be more objective because there&#39;s no way our world is a spinning ball, flying in a random direction for all eternity. You&#39;re all so confident, it&#39;s like you&#39;ve been to outer space. You think you&#39;re open-minded because you know they lied about the moon landings? The moon isn&#39;t even the kind of thing that can be walked. YouTube <em>The World&#39;s Greatest Secret</em> for a quick 101 on it, then learn as much as you can, then spread this like wildfire to wake up the masses. This theory has been popping in and out of your life for a couple years now, and it won&#39;t go away because it&#39;s not a psyop: the solar system model we all learned in grade school is false, all those propaganda movies you love, false. The only psyops are the ones trying to slow you down, like rappers or dumb athletes scaring you away. The globe model has a ton of flaws, even what&#39;s in my history doesn&#39;t cover half of it. This is the truth that, if spread, would make a domino effect that reveals the rest of the crazy world we&#39;re in. The implication of the sun going around the circular Earth (reality) instead of the <del>spherical</del> <del>oblate spheroid</del> pear-shaped Earth going around the sun is that God must certainly exist, and as you may know, lucefrion satanist psychopaths rule the &quot;planet&quot;</p>

<p>Basically the reason he doesn&#39;t believe in a round world is his distrust of government. He thinks the moon landing was fake. He thinks the Hubble and ISS are not real and the images and information is just to keep people complacent. </p>

<p>Basically he believes that there is no way we went out to space, so we just cannot know. </p>

<p>I just wanna keep asking, and other planets are round but we flat? </p>

<p>If you drop a drop of water what shape does it form? A flat plain or a round drop? </p>

<p>He just doesn&#39;t trust science and government. He also believes in the &quot;link&quot; between vaccines and autism. So I mean he kinda is lost as fuck just with basic things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My answer to your plane question would be because the navigation systems (GPS) are based off of flat earth coordinates. So if you set the plane automatically on a course to fly &quot;around the earth&quot; it would actually be taking you in a very large circle but the turning would be too slight for you to perceive at that large of a radius.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are half right. But the other half is that people&#39;s consciousness interprets the universe differently and that is ok. So even tho in your world (and mine) these people are insane overall it really doesn&#39;t matter. Allow people to be where they are. Tolerance is the key; people should be allowed to be different.</p>

<p>Now when people try to impose themselves on you that&#39;s differnt; they need to allow you too be a &quot;sphere-earther.&quot; that&#39;s the same courtesy you should give them.</p>

<p>If you can demonstrate that a significant number of people in this sub have changed their mind on a subject because they were challenged with evidence and a rational argument, I will change my mind and retract my statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things wrong with that methodology.</p>

<p>First, 15,000 might sound large to you, but given there&#39;s over 454 thousand conspiracy subscribers, that&#39;s about 3% of the subscriber base, not counting the same person posting twice or other people quoting them.</p>

<p>Second, the first result when I did a search presented me with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why I changed my mind about Trump; I once believed him during his campaign. Now I realize he&#39;s a lying thief, a conman, just like the Presidents before him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the first result is basically saying I &quot;changed my mind&quot; to believing the fucking obvious. This is not a very convincing metric of measuring how often evidence and rational arguments changes people&#39;s minds.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve presented is a metric of how fickle and/or gullible people can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Physics. a theory, formulated essentially by Albert Einstein, that <strong>all motion must be defined relative to a frame of reference and that space and time are relative, rather than absolute concepts</strong>: it consists of two principal parts. The theory dealing with uniform motion (special theory of relativity or special relativity) is based on the two postulates that physical laws have the same mathematical form when expressed in any inertial system, and the velocity of light is independent of the motion of its source and will have the same value when measured by observers moving with constant velocity with respect to each other. Derivable from these postulates are the conclusions that there can be no motion at a speed greater than that of light in a vacuum, mass increases as velocity increases, mass and energy are equivalent, and time is dependent on the relative motion of an observer measuring the time. The theory dealing with gravity (general theory of relativity or general relativity) is based on the postulate that the local effects of a gravitational field and of acceleration of an inertial system are identical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What surprises me is that those claiming to have eyes to see still believe the oldest lies from the founders of modern Scientism. The argument isn&#39;t about the shape of the earth, it&#39;s about who is lying. In the end, there are two scales: the truth, and the popular opinion. Why does everyone we claim as conspiracy theorists to distrust love the globe there, this should raise red flags. The Flat Earth society is a conspiracy in and of itself, full of shills to take away any credibility to questioning the shape of the earth. It&#39;s a classic tactic. We as human creatures hate being outside of the crowd, even if we know something is off. That&#39;s why one will agree that 2+2=5 if enough people sway them that way and shun those who disagree. It gets passed on and eventually becomes tradition. Upon evaluation it can easy be seen to be false, yet the generations that believed the lie will have too much cognitive dissonance to see they are pushing an emotional reaction onto something and will result in the backfire effect. Globe earthers usually end up in the bin of the backfired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard about flat earth a couple years ago and was in shock.  Hollow earth shocked me even more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that crazy though, because REALLY the only thing we have that &quot;proves&quot; the earth&#39;s shape is.... well nothing.  There really isn&#39;t any definitive proof either way.  I could be wrong.  Pictures don&#39;t prove it to me.  Neither does Erastothenes or NASA or seeing the curvature because I&#39;ve never seen it and I&#39;ve been on a sailboat in the open ocean, I&#39;ve climbed a mountain in Hawaii and seen only flat water,  I see ocean every day and it looks level, water is ALWAYS level on this earth, isn&#39;t it?  Why don&#39;t the stars move more? How do they know the universe is expanding? At what point can I actually see the curvature?  I live on a tidal estuary, what experiments could I do to find out? Can I check the levelness of the water at high tide sighting down the water at a predetermined location 100 yards away and find out? Or would that be a mirage as well?  Sigh.  I&#39;m just tired of being told &quot;it&#39;s true cuz scientists.&quot;  As if scientists and science have never been wrong.</p>

<p>bubbles in the water of &quot;spacewalk&quot; videos</p>

<p>Dust reflecting a light source. Notice in all of those &quot;bubbles&quot; videos that the &quot;bubbles&quot; never travel in the same direction, they seem aimless. </p>

<p>green screen and astronauts hanging on wires on ISS</p>

<p>Never seen a credible instance of this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ISS videos showing no clouds at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have also never seen an instance of this. At least regarding to what youre talking about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimes forgetting to put lights on the night</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly dont know what this means. Im not sure its grammatically correct. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>satellites and ISS is made of material which should melt where they are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ive heard this one before! So the upper atmosphere is actually really hot, way hotter than one would think. Like 2500C in the thermosphere where the ISS sits. What you are forgetting is how little gas there is. </p>

<p>So if you have a handful of molocules per square foot even though they are at a high temperature there isnt enough of them to feel it. </p>

<p>It would be like having a grain of rice 2500C and tossing it in with sand. The sand wont rise to 2500C</p>

<blockquote>
<p>video of the spinning globe but no moving clouds at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clouds move quickly but the distances involved are so large that it appears to be not moving or moving very slowly. You also have to remember the atmosphere is moving with the planet</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the photoshopped word sex written in clouds in official NASA photos of the earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheeky composite artist. NASA never denied it shopped composite images together. Because satellites dont fly <em>that</em> high up when they take a photo its only of a very small part of the earth so after a dozens of passes the satellite has piece by piece taken photos of the whole planet. Now the clouds wont line up because they are in motion so they edit them to give the best images possible and never once have they lied about it being edited. </p>

<p>Look up the DSCOVR-EPIC satellite. These are unedited whole Earth photos. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moon Landings: Ha, don&#39;t get me started</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did we get a mirror array on the moon? I know it exists because we bounced signals off of them in college, we actually were able to calculate the distances involved!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why have none of the 10,000 satellites in orbit ever seen in ISS video? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think you can see a non reflective fridge hundreds if not thousands of miles away? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything a satellite is supposed to do can be done by planes, cables and towers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Without getting into too much detail the company I work for rents time on a satellite and I can say for certain the topographical data we get cannot be recreated by using towers or planes. </p>

<p>From the same satellite, EPIC View of Moon Transiting the Earth</p>

<p>Two things to add, whats the focal length of the lenses involved? The distances involved are also misleading. So that apollo photo showing a &quot;small&quot; earth was taken from 200k miles away from the moon itself using (Im pretty sure) standard old school 70mm film, Im not sure about the lens. </p>

<p>Now imagine that EPIC is nearly 1 million miles away taking a photo of the moon at nearly 800k miles away, the Earth is &quot;only&quot; 200k miles from the moon in that instance. </p>

<p>Heres an example <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8XEbF">http://imgur.com/a/8XEbF</a>  </p>

<p>I dont have audio at the moment so Im assuming this is the oblate spheroid thing? </p>

<p>It technically is... The center is slightly enlarged from the tidal forces, its not a &quot;perfect&quot; circle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people need to do their research, when it&#39;s been proven time and time again? You can see it in nature, as I just said in another comment, look at a sunset, you know that the horizon of the earth blocks the sun from your view, you can visualize how this works on a spherical model, as the earth rotates the side away from the sun loses light. Try doing this on a flat plane and tell me how you replicate a sunset while also providing light to another location, it just doesn&#39;t work. My point is we&#39;ve been told the earth is round because it is, and anyone can see it by just using logic. The earth was once considered flat, but then some smart started to realize that a flat Earth just wasn&#39;t consistent with their observations in nature. If someone tells me I&#39;m a sheep because I believe what I&#39;m told versus investigating myself then I do find that offensive. I&#39;m sure there are people who do believe the earth is round because that&#39;s all they&#39;ve ever been told but couldn&#39;t prove it, but that doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that smarter men than I have proved it, and it&#39;s very easy to prove myself.

1. The US Navy, a government agency that lies to us on the daily
2. James Cameron, a Hollywood special effects genius known for cleverly recreating underwater events.
See how this works?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of people do have everyday experience that indicates the Earth isn&#39;t flat, though.</p>

<p>People point a satellite dish into the sky and received a TV signal from a geostationary satellite.</p>

<p>People flying to multiple continents end up back home having only flown West or only flown East.</p>

<p>People visibly observe the ISS pass over them repeatedly on a consistent schedule.</p>

<p>Of course, when these points are brought up, flat-Earthers tell you your personal observations are deceiving you due to a bigger conspiracy at play. Satellite dishes are actually pointing to a giant, somehow invisible, tower, that&#39;s actually as tall as a satellite would be flying. Airlines are in on the conspiracy for some reason and the flight paths are fake. The ISS is just a drone flying on repeat/holographic projection. </p>

<p>At some point, you might as well just believe you&#39;re in a vat connected to the Matrix, given how unreliable you have to believe the world around you is to be a flat-Earther.</p>

<p>a good lesson to learn from this flat earth thing is to step back and reevaluate just how open minded you yourself are.</p>

<p>im not saying you need to believe in everything, but if anyone reading this jumps on flat eathers and thinks to themselves how ridiculous it is to believe in it they need/should also step back and realize that feeling they just experienced is the same one people who think antivaxxers or 911 truthers are dumb.</p>

<p>on the flip side, if you believe in a conspiracy that others think is crazy maybe also step back and at least educate yourself on the reasoning behind why people believe in one thing or another.</p>

<p>I personally dont believe in the flat earth, but I find the reasoning behind the theory extremely interesting/intriguing even if it requires some leaps to work (global conspiracy, etc)</p>

<p>Thats now how fish eye works. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheye_lens#/media/File:Panotools5618.jpg">A fish eye lens causes everything near the edge to distort and curve.</a></p>

<p>In the video you have the earth curving, but the capsule in the same spot does not. Funny thing, at 45 seconds there IS still a curve. It is small, but still noticeable. If you look at a portion of video from outside with the same width it looks the same.</p>

<p>It certainly does. If someone told you that when they eat food its broken down by shit elves and put into a furnace you would laugh in their face. To what lengths should you go through to prove its a normal biological process?</p>

<p>My point still stands. A normal person doesnt have the technology to see an electron travel and a normal person doesnt have the technology to view exoplanets. </p>

<p>Why is one not magic but the other is? </p>

<p>I would also argue that with a little research into PCBs and how they function you could understand how it works without fancy technology. You can perform an experiment and see if the result at the end is what we would expect if an electron moves across the board. </p>

<p>Same with cosmology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to understand the issue is not the height, but the speed. GPS location uses 3 different signals from different satellites to triangulate your location. It does this by having the satellite send what time it is by radio. Knowing the satellite is in a fixed geostationary orbit, and knowing their time is correct due to an atomic clock, your phone can do math to figure out where it is.</p>

<p>Saying that you&#39;re closer to the satellites is pretty stupid to. They&#39;re 35786 KM away from the earth. 12 kilometers doesn&#39;t make a difference. But the speed does, since your phone can&#39;t do the math fast enough.</p>

<p>But more importantly, I think you&#39;re missing something out of your western values. They contain <em>both</em> individualism and democracy (group/collective decision making and action). The entire history of &quot;Western&quot; thought is a balance of the two (traditionally traced to ancient Greece at least), you can&#39;t leave out the group/democracy part.</p>

<p>I will give you that the individual is sacred. Now, you can follow it with &quot;the law of the jungle is the only law&quot;, money-talks, might is right etc (these are the only alternatives to popular law and democratized power) then I&#39;m saying you&#39;ve​ walked off the &quot;western culture&quot; reservation just like half of the right wing of the USA are trying to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s not fair. You&#39;re taking my statement far too literal. But I have to admit it was oversimplefied. There have been great cultures with great knowledge. However, knowledge is not a cumulative thing, knowledge can be lost. The point I tried to make is that both sides of the argument have been supported by autorities, nothing more. 
I never stated social and societal structures where different back in the day, hence also my statement that people were hung because of their opinions. </p>

<p>What is trust? Some say the earth is a sphere, and others say it&#39;s a disc, if i don&#39;t trust both of them, does that mean I can&#39;t think the earth is a sphere, nor that it is a disc? If I trust noone, does that mean I can&#39;t have an opinion? Can I only believe in what I have absolutely seen myself? If that&#39;s the case, how much farther have I come than the first men? </p>

<p>The discussion depends on the definition of trust. Does trust mean you choose to believe something that you have not seen with your own eyes, or does trust mean that after all information, and the structures around it have been analysed, I choose to accept an explanation as the truth (untill there is reason to change that view)? Thruth and trust, even the words are similar. What do we absolutely 100% surely know? There have been many interesting discussions about this. (Will search for a link in a sec)</p>

<p>I trust no autority, but I trust some information, because we all do, we have too. Does that mean I will never be 100% right, yes it does. But when you know nothing, how many percent right are you? I do always interpret information, weigh the motives, see why they could be wrong, so I never take anything for a fact because someone said so. But in the end I have to choose something, and then we come back to wether the earth is round or flat. </p>

The pendulum is set into motion by lifting and releasing the pendulum, however it is impossible to release it in a 100% straight motion. Over time this results is a slight circular motion. Moreover, pendulums rotating in opposite directions from the same hemisphere.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth Society is a shill organization meant to mislead people who only do superficial research into the subject by making claims such as : <em>gravity is cause by a constant upward motion by the earth</em> I&#39;m not here to defend there claims.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right about me not having a telescope. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of my main issues with FEers. You really believe the Earth is flat but you dont put forth a single ounce of effort beyond youtube videos. If you really believed this you would at the very least get a damn telescope. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which looks like a screen saver from 2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your opinion. Get a really nice new telescope and try again. In that example it is probably a very nice very expensive telescope. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason I&#39;m asking for your first-hand video or photo is because I while I plan to conduct this experiment myself, I think you may be able to do it sooner and I actually do trust you to post authentic evidence if you can obtain it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to get this straight. You are asking me for personal video of the planets, of which I told you I dont have the ability to do, and you dont trust any other images or sources out there but you will trust me... Dude this makes no sense. Get  your own telescope, do your own research. Im not here to hold you hand, all I can do is share the knowledge I know. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. Density is merely the amount of compactness in a substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in zero gravity what is the density of an unknown object, how would you find it? For objects to separate according to density there must be an attracting force. As I have said before mix oil and water and leave them in zero gravity (Whatever) even though the densities are different they will not separate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider this: When Newton developed his theory of gravity he was unaware of the magnetic force. Today we know that every body, where it be organic or otherwise, has a magnetic field. Both of our models agree that earth itself has a giant magnetic field with a pole at the north. Magnetic fields are absolutely observable and testable. Even in public schools we revealed magnetic fields by pouring iron shavings over a magnet which then aligns the shavings in a way that outlines the influence of the force which is otherwise invisible. So we can prove that magnetism has the ability to attract and repel objects and energies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now consider this. Newton was brilliant but a little nutty. We can prove that magnetism attracts objects of opposite polarity. Lets run a very simple experiment to prove this. </p>

<p>Build a box that is EM shielded. These are pretty easy to make. Put an object in the box and measure the objects weight. An item in an EM shielded box behaves the same way as if it werent in that box. This means there must be a force attracting that is immune to EM shielding. </p>

<p>We can even take it a step further. Make this EM shielded box a vacuum. So we have no density conflicts and we have no EM therefore the item in the box should be weightless. Is it? No, again you could run this experiment yourself if you had the desire to do so. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, we see that as in a lava lamp density / buoyancy affects the relative position of the liquids. A hot air balloon controls it&#39;s buoyancy to reach a new state of equilibrium at a different altitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lava lamp will not work in zero gravity (whatever). So lets put a lava lamp in an EM shielded box, what happens when the attracting  force is removed? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the forces which we can actaully directly test are explainable through electromagnetism and density (which is really another expression of the electromagnetic force acting on the very small). We only need gravity to prove the theoretical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you do not understand even EM. Why arent magnets heavier than other metals of the same density? Show me anywhere where there is a model of EM that models our solar system. Seriously if you are so certain this exists then show me where you found your evidence. </p>

<p>I can give  you volumes of info on how gravity works, its all right there for you. You cant say the same about EM. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prove it. Do the experiment. If you really need me to challenge that specifically then you&#39;ve missed my larger point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its been done... Many times</p>

<p>he only calculated the curve for that model.</p>

<p>Of which has not been disproved. If you can disprove that model you are fucking brilliant and will win many prizes. Again dude Im not sure how knowledgeable you are on this. </p>

<p>Can you? Please do. </p>
