        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...Talking specifically about the depopulation bit, I honestly think it is necessary. Mankind won&#39;t voluntarily cut down its own population. Life extension isn&#39;t too far away. I have to agree with that part of the endgame that deals in depopulation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really agree with much else from my understanding. However I also think that they won&#39;t succeed. The coming Technological Singularity will have a vast effect on everything. A New World Order could not exist in a Transhumanist Cloud based society. Centralized power would be obsolete. A collective of millions of connected augmented minds would be a streamlined form of world government, even if there was some kind of organizing to scale and area.</p>

<p>Production being nearly entirely automated would make little room for need of workers. The Average Joe might not know what to do with themselves at that point but certainly that world would be ideal for engineers and artists. However, even being able to provide all the food and water people need, people take up space. Space that is taken from natural habitat of other life. I am not going to be nice about it. Most people are fucking NPC&#39;s. Nothing more than the end sum of their external stimuli and governed by our still stuck in the stone ages brain (Cognitive Dissonance, Mob mentality, etc). Most of us are really expendable. We are needed now as a workforce, but later when a workforce is obsolete, and 3d Printers become 3d Nano-Printers then possibly smaller (as theorized), our human numbers will not be useful. With life expansion, and literally beating death by aging within 35 years, our numbers will continue to grow, and with that more space will be needed, which takes away from nature.</p>

<p>I think depopulation is necessary. I just don&#39;t think these asshats who are the real power in the world should have any future themselves.</p>

<p>There is no feel good way to depopulate. However, I think one way or another, it needs to happen. People won&#39;t be responsible when it comes to breeding. While some cultures are slowly declining, others are going full steam. Islam for one, using Hijrah, seeks to convert the world through immigration and numbers alone. It is a soft form of jihad. They aren&#39;t the only ones who uses breeding irresponsibly, but I digress.</p>

<p>Just some rambling thoughts. Feel free to add, or flame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have chosen not to have kids. I don&#39;t have any. That is a start. If you are referring to offing myself, that is ridiculous. If you care for me to explain why that is ridiculous you can and I will, but I think that&#39;s a pointless endeavor.</p>

<p>Why is it sick? Because it is uncomfortable to accept or think about? Does the reality of the situation, of reality, of even the circle of life cause such discomfort? Life isn&#39;t about fairness, life isn&#39;t about morality. These are human concepts. They don&#39;t exist in the world outside civilization. There are consequences for population issues.</p>

<p>So lets say we have a boat full of people, and they begin to grow in number till there is little space and not enough resources.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think this idea of depopulation is easier to accept because of the scale we speak of? Vast numbers  of almost impossible to imagine people?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s scale it down.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you are trapped in a room with a group of ten people and limited food.  Rescue is coming but not for a couple of weeks. 
 Too late for everyone to survive but some will.  Majority of the people in there are children.  You are an adult and by far smarter and stronger.</p>

<p>Would you be willing to do the unthinkable to maintain your own survival? Would you want to go on after, if you did?</p>

<p>Would you stand by and watch while another adult did it?</p>

<p>Not trying to paint you as a monster but they are honest questions. If you&#39;d be willing to consider them, I&#39;d like to know what your thoughts are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Self preservation, of course being a powerful thing, would make what I think now, compared to being in that actual situation more than likely not an honest answer. From what I know, hunger and thirst, desperation, make logical thinking, and idealistic thinking pretty much not a thing.</p>

<p>After exhausting every effort to figure out an escape from this room...</p>

<p>I would, before onset idiocy sets in, try and figure out how to ration out the resources, figure out projected finish line of said resources, and figure out if it could be possible. When finding out it isn&#39;t possible, I would then try and figure out how to be able to save the highest amount of people. I would have to come to the conclusion that of course not everyone is going to make it. Then it comes to figuring out a value system. Adults eat more than children. So who is the most expendable. How much farther could we stretch resources with less adults. What adults have the most value? I would choose an adult Engineer or Scientist over a kid who has zero future in adding to furthering the Human races potential. However, if the adult too had nothing to add I would likely value the child more.</p>

<p>The thing is, I am making judgments on values that I find to be necessary in this scenario. Would I kill someone to survive? More than likely. Ideally, I would say right now I would give my own life for someone I thought would be a far better addition to the world in a way that actually makes the world a better place. By world I don&#39;t just mean Humans btw.</p>

<p>If I saw an adult attack a child, I would likely react in killing the adult. That is an instinct at base. Legit, I have taken down hit and run drivers, purse snatchers, and on several occasions stood against gangs trying to assault people. I have a martial arts background and 10+ years in Pro Wrestling so I can am very capable of stepping into bad situations, and never back away from them. So an adult attacking a kid would more than likely trigger an strong automatic response to defend the child. However, to be honest, that is what I think now, not how my stressed mind in that particular situation might handle it. I generally keep a clear head in shit situations though, but I have never been in a situation like the one proposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the detailed, honest reply.  </p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s possible, because most of us have never been in that situation, we may react differently than we believe we would.  I&#39;d like to think we are more compassionate and caring than instinctively self-preserving.  We may not be so, sadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think in order to not destroy our planet depopulation or mass exodus is about the only to save it at this point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s morally horrible idea of course, but...</p>

<p>Off topic a little bit, but looking at human life from an evolutionary standpoint, we&#39;re weakening the gene pool with every feeble and frail individual that we save and then they procreate.  This is actually a bad thing for our race as a whole.   But what right minded individual is going to say &quot;Nope, we&#39;re going to let you die for humanity&#39;s sake.&quot;      Quite a bit of a conundrum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is a gigantic place. the threat of over-population on this planet, to me, is another farce. We are nowhere near close to any form of dire need to restrict anything in terms of food. If there was a need, corporations like McDonalds would not be in business anymore, as the cattle and fowl farming they need to use for beef and chicken supply are taking up valuable land space that human&#39;s could populate and live off of as vegetarians. </p>

<p>Depopulation is a con-job like no other thing, save for global warming/climate change.</p>
