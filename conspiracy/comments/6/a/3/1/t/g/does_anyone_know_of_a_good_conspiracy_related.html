Also, saw a post today about some dude getting mad because he was called out as having a young account? Did people all of a sudden forget that you need to have some indication of proof that you aren&#39;t out to spread lies and misconceptions, I think we call those people shills?</p>

<p>EDIT: Dudes, what a turn out! Thanks heaps for all these, I should have listening pleasure for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Neil Degrasse Tyson episodes. Dr Rhonda Patrick, if you&#39;re into health. He just had Guy Ritchie on and it was actually pretty enlightening. Laurence Kraus was another one. </p>

<p>Sometimes I like at the guest and think &quot;ffs it&#39;s a damn comedian&quot;. But then it ends up being an awesome episode. </p>

<p>But the mother of all was episode #911 with Alex Jones. I think AJ is controlled opposition, but it was still fun to listen to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How on earth has no one mentioned The Higherside Chats?  Its my favorite podcast and he covers a wide range of conspiracies and is not afraid of getting into weird territory. The host is also very good at letting his guests tell their piece without letting his personal opinions or beliefs get in the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thehighersidechatsplus.com/">http://www.thehighersidechatsplus.com/</a></p>

<p>Theres a free version of the podcast and a plus version. The plus is worth is in my mind. Extra hour in every show and they tend to get into the really weird territory in that extra hour. 4-5 shows a month so $5 for 4-5 extra hours of content is well worth it in my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By weird territory do you mean topics that seem so outrageous that we don&#39;t want to let ourselves give it too much thought for fear that we might be crazy? So for me this is something like reptilians, a lot of alien siting, pure evil; you know things that are almost too scary to believe in. If it delves into the scary stuff, and uses logic, questions, and truth, I am on board. Without those 3 things, I just don&#39;t see myself giving a lot of what would be said much credit. I would really want to, but just couldn&#39;t if it didn&#39;t meet my personal criteria I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havent heard a reptilian show but tons of stuff on aliens, archons inter-dimensional entities, flat earth theory. He gives the guest the chance to make their case and doesnt really try to challenge their assertion but just prod them to share the evidence they believe support their conclusions. He often has a monologue after a show giving some additional thought but the point never seems to be to prove/disprove a theory. But rather just to get the topic out there and get people talking about it.</p>

<p>He also has many shows on more reality grounded topics (relatively speaking) like hollywood or politics. One of my personal favorite shows is he has on ATL Carver to talk about Meme Magic and Kek and the effect they had on the election. Im not a fan of Trump at all but I do think there is some credibility to the premise of that show which is that words and symbols have power and can bring about a desired result. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, the election is what began all of this for me. I thought &quot;I&#39;m being told this, shown this, and then this is what happens, all different&quot; and decided to start doing some digging myself. I&#39;m really keen to look into opinions on mass social manipulation through technology and science.</p>

<p>I really enjoy when people ask a lot of questions and let the person answering make their own mind up through the asking of those questions. The first &quot;woke&quot; moment I had was when I realised mass social manipulation was used in elections constantly, and had no idea how people were not annoyed by this. Man social media is such a manipulative piece of shit.</p>
