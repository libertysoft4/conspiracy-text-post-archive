        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First and foremost, I love you guys. You guys are some of the most brightest, caring, compassionate, people I had the opportunity to witness. True sincerity in your concerns of what is happening in the world. The problem is that we will never piece together the whole picture, or even part of the picture since we do not have all the pieces. </p>

<p>Its like doing a puzzle with half the pieces missing, and we can make out part of the image and we can assume &quot;oh its this&quot; but if we had all the pieces, it would actually be something completely else. </p>

<p>What does this mean? It means this is a distraction and that it was intentional. Think about it. They want us on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Why? Because we are consuming, and not giving. Yes, we can spread this information as far and wide as possible but it does not do anything. I hear users all the time saying &quot;I invested thousands of hours into this research,&quot; and we appreciate those efforts yet thousands of hours were sank into something that might not appear the way it is. </p>

<p>If we really want to enact change, which is what we want deep inside of our hearts, it begins in our daily lives. The information here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does nothing but put us into despair and we know half of it is probably not even true. And we don&#39;t really have any methods to figure out if its true.</p>

<p>They wanted this. They wanted us to be kooks. They want anarchy. They control the military and all the weapons. Do you think they really care about revolutions and the people rising up? They can stop it anytime they want. They want us divided, marching up and down the streets, wasting our time and destroying our towns. They can end us with a press of a button. </p>

<p>Their true fear does not come from the thought of a wide scale revolt, but us bringing love and healing to those around us. I don&#39;t know anyone that was healed and loved by listening to about Project Blue Beam or the truth about 9/11. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a truth for you. TPTB spread the truth about 9/11 themselves. They want you to be angry and confused and focused on bullshit. Because what truly matters and enacts change is having a peaceful mind and loving heart. But all this information just fills us with hate when TPTB need love themselves. </p>

<p>I love you guys, and I&#39;m not saying what we are doing here is all for naught, but it is keeping us from seeing the big picture.</p>

<p>Take care! :)</p>

<p>I did not become disillusioned. If anything, the information on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> makes you disillusioned.

<p>Sounds like you are disillusioned.  Anyway, you are entitled to do what you think is right for you.  I don&#39;t agree that you need to try guide others down the same path.  </p>

<p>As for &#39;spending my time reading about things that might not go anywhere&#39;?  I&#39;m here because I might actually learn something.  yes, a lot of it is filler and misinformation but most is not.  I gave up watching hollywood propaganda / television so I&#39;m not exactly missing out on anything by being here.</p>

<p>Good luck with your future wherever you end up, friend.  Take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I halfway agree with you, except that a lot of things are pieced together and unraveled here BEFORE they happen, I think, and that stops them in their tracks. </p>

<p>Nothing really major happened during the satanic holidays this year, and I think there may have been things in the works with Syria or No. Korea. We saw the fake beheadings stop when McCain&#39;s trip got exposed. Certainly the Clinton election was at least partially derailed by what went down on Reddit and other alt-news places.</p>

<p>I did have someone with authority in the conspiracy community say that looking backwards to unravel things is not nearly important as looking forward and stopping whatever comes next. But you don&#39;t know the ones you stop, only the ones you miss. </p>

<p>So I understand your feelings and I halfway agree. But I don&#39;t think leaving makes a whole lot of sense. </p>

<p><em>Leave r/conspiracy  -- &quot;you should quit reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot;
*You&#39;re a &quot;kook&quot;  -- &quot;They wanted us to be kooks.&quot;
*Don&#39;t protest --  &quot;They want us divided, marching up and down the streets, wasting our time and destroying our towns.&quot;
*Threats/ fear --  &quot;They can end us with a press of a button.&quot; &quot;They can stop it anytime they want.&quot;
*Be complacent --  &quot;Because what truly matters and enacts change is having a peaceful mind and loving heart.&quot;
*Don&#39;t hate the oligarchs -- &quot;But all this information just fills us with hate when TPTB need love themselves.&quot;
*They *don&#39;t</em> want anarchy, because the status quo is great for some --  &quot;They want anarchy.&quot;
*They are frightened of the masses, (as evidenced by the Venezuela uprising being completely ignored by our controlled media) -- Do you think they really care about revolutions and the people rising up?</p>

<p>&quot;Because what truly matters and enacts change is having a peaceful mind and loving heart.&quot; to which I say, <strong>&quot;Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.&quot;</strong> - Frederick Douglass</p>

The Franklin scandal is real! The Dutroux affair is real! Iran-Contra is real! MKultra is real! This is not stuff that was &quot;planted&quot; by &quot;TPTB&quot;, these are wicked programs made by segments of government/intelligence agencies and their attempts at covering them up!</p>

<p>This is a horrific thread, because it is an attempt at stifling the truth, even if this poster was being &quot;sincere&quot;. If you are a not a shill, you should probably go to shareblue and get a fucking paycheck because you are acting like one. Stop stifling the truth.</p>

<p>If you truly feel this way, then express it in your life by loving your neighbor and living right. What you have done here is an attempt at demoralizing people, even if you might not have meant to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just open your mind to what I am saying for a second. This sub would be shutdown if it was really tackling any issues or revealing the truth. Anything we have &quot;discovered&quot; has been planted there to be &quot;discovered.&quot; They have been doing this for a thousands of years. Do you think Wikileaks couldnt be shut down if the government really wanted to do so? You think Edward Snowden really couldnt be caught? Look at the protests in France and Venezuela. They are laughing at us. &quot;Yes spend your time revolting and starting fires in your neighborhood. Its not like you have any better solutions if you were even able to take us down.&quot; &quot;Yes spend your time on this subreddit we have successfully taken over and manipulated.&quot; </p>

<p>We were traumatized from birth. The internet is their tool. We know they withhold technology from us. What makes you think they were not aware of the trajectory of the internet? </p>

<p>I am an ardent reader of the high level insider. He said it himself the internet is compromised. What does he suggest we do? To learn and research tangible practical solutions to the problems around us, not sit around in anger and hate.</p>

<p>As for loving the oligarchs, this is exactly why they became this way. Because they were not loved or did not know how to receive love. They are sociopaths. So do we give in and do as they do? Not love, not trust, and stew in anger? The very fact that my post angers you guys legitimizes the point I am trying to make. This is the biggest conspiracy of all. That they have set this up. They have set us up for failure. Anything on the internet is what they wanted us to do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is entertainment for me. I&#39;m not here to save the world, I&#39;m here to be intellectually diverted, and occasionally to learn something. Anyone who thinks they can make significant change on their own is kidding themselves. Change comes through social movements, and those require large numbers and the mementum of public opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a cheerleader, enjoying the rise of the alt right and nationalism, while it lasts, before the final plunge into the darkness and horror that is cultural Marxism. I don&#39;t take anything too seriously, and neither should you. Just enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>Information must be shared. 
It is an incredibly imperfect, highly monitored and manipulated platform but it is all we have to work with (net forums).</p>

<p>The quality of this sub has been mightily eroded but instead of these &quot;everybody abandon ship&quot; posts that keep popping up why not double down with high effort, info heavy quality posting?  </p>
