    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a hard fact that people with severely decreased levels of  empathy conscience and remorse who are at base afraid that others are secretly just like themselves seek and often gain the power they need to control others. </p>

<p>Once that power is attained  it is  exploited. Someone who lacks these humanizing qualities  feels no reason to lead his underlings away from harm. They sometimes even create harm that they can profit from in terms of power, attention  or money. </p>

<p>They try the hardest to get power and in doing so they don&#39;t have the limits of more normal human beings and will lie, cheat, steal or even kill to get that power. </p>

<p>Since a more developed mind doesn&#39;t allow those behaviors the psychopath always wins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That invites a challenge. Granted I fon&#39;t think Jimmy Carter wasa psychopath. He is a true humanitarian , hoerbrt the bulk of the other leaders were climically psychopathic and they used every dirty trick available to ruin his presidency and his role as a leader to vlacken the names of humnanitarians Any other examples of leaders who could demonstrate the possession of empathy, compassion, conscience and remorse?</p>

<p>If  do they were compromised y the others who only ever support others like themselves because they consider conscience a weakness. It&#39;s actually a part of any mind that&#39;s developed beyond the level of snakes and alligators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s business as usual except that I&#39;m hoping people are starting to see what a farce the whole thing is. Plenty already do, but there isn&#39;t really much to do but sit back and watch. I assume at some point there will be a flashpoint of some sort to get the potatoes off of their couches, but I&#39;m not sure what/when/where/why/how that will happen.</p>

<p>Best case would be for everyone to understand that ALL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT are bad. And that PURE ANARCHY SHOULD REIGN. </p>

<p>Not really, but usually empires fall only to be replaced by a &#39;new, better system&#39; which is the same shit just re-packaged and with new faces. I&#39;m kinda hoping we can just move to a leader-less solution. Still, though, I have no faith in any human not to fuck everything up so the best I hope for is a small period of excitement and maybe good times before it all goes to shit.</p>

<p>Then again, it&#39;s all about to go to shit so I guess the fun and good times are pretty much at an end. So let&#39;s hope the shit part ain&#39;t too bad (like global thermonuclear war - assuming the whole nuke shit isn&#39;t just another psyop).</p>

<p>OH WELL FUCK IT WHO AM I KIDDING? WE ARE ALL SERIOUSLY ABOUT TO DIE EXCEPT THOSE ROTHSCHILD ASSHOLES WHO WILL FLEE TO THEIR BUNKERS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF COLORADO AND PROBABLY IN EUROPE LIKE THE HIMALAYAS WHILE WE GET INCINERATED WOO HOOO FUCKING GET DRUNK TODAY AND </p>
