        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We need to explicitly reject any partisanship in our thinking about policy. And I do many ANY partisanship. It does nothing but cloud our thinking.</p>

<p>Even non-party terms like right, left, libertarian, conservative and progressive are counterproductive. They still try to put you into a camp, instead of having you think for yourself about each idea. That can cause you to reject a good idea, or accept a bad idea.</p>

<p>Often, I talk to people realize they were wrong about a policy, and then they spend the majority of their time trying to find a new label: &quot;Maybe I&#39;m not a conservative, I&#39;m a libertarian!&quot;</p>

<p>The most important thing is to build your worldview around certainties. &quot;I know that constitutional rights should be protected, and we should not start aggressive wars&quot; is a real basis for a worldview.</p>

<p>Every policy needs to be examined on its own. Apply your certain principles, and decide on an independent basis which ideas are good, and which are bad.</p>

<p>I encourage you to commit yourself to explicitly stop identifying with any political party or ideology. Stop using any partisan words to describe yourself or others. And you will find yourself in a much better position to think clearly and interact with others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A partisan is an <em>adherent</em> to a cause.</p>

<p>How can you tell?</p>

<p>If I say I disagree with the 5-4 Supreme Court <em>Citizens United</em> decision because the Constitution does not provide rights to corporations or because &quot;press&quot; is not equal to &quot;corporation,&quot; or because money-speech crowds out human speech, I wind up agreeing with a result promoted by Democrats.</p>

<p>Am I a Democratic partisan now?</p>

<p>But if I say that the 5-4 Supreme Court <em>Heller</em> case was decided rightly (despite the poor reasoning therein) because a total hand gun ban in a large city reasonably violates the Second Amendment, or because more importantly, because making more general changes in society would reduce gun murders more effectively, I wind up agreeing with a result promoted by Republicans.</p>

<p>Am I a Republican partisan now?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Partisan requires more. A partisan must <em>adhere</em> to a cause -- not merely support one. Here are some tell-tale signs of partisans:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A screen name posts a whopping 16 articles to Reddit yesterday, each and all of them promoting one party or disparaging the other. (True story)</p></li>
<li><p>A person continues to support a &quot;fact&quot; even though the person has been shown that it is plainly false -- where that fact falls into line with their political  views.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These two are the easy cases, but of course, there are many more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heartily agree. I think these parties take advantage of our social instincts as herd animals for inclusion. There is this faulty perception that we need to find where our ideas fit and go join those like us. I&#39;m sure I have some crazy ideas that I won&#39;t even pretend are logical or consistent, and they resist party categorization. Sometimes I can relate a little to what a certain platform is about, but if I dig in at all there is always an idea that they have that completely disqualify them from my world view.</p>

<p>We need to get rid of parties. It is like legislation. They have this one thing you really want, and they pack the rest with a whole bunch of irrelevant pork and agenda driven stipulations. And if you want the good, you gotta buy the pork too. It is complete bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide et impera is certainly a technique employed by many but there&#39;s nothing wrong with identifying systems of thought for what they are.  At times is has nothing to do with partisanship.  For example, classical liberalism and libertarianism is what this country was founded on and is what led to the increased standards of living here.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>There absolutely is. It creates loyalty feelings, which predispose you to rejecting ideas from others, and accepting ideas from your own camp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, classical liberalism and libertarianism is what this country was founded on and is what led to the increased standards of living here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are intentionally imprecise terms. Your very language is under assault.</p>

<p>For example, the Founders, from Washington to Hamilton to even the libertarian Jefferson all supported internal improvements: canals, roads, and eventually rail. They understood that government could build some projects at an advantage relative to the private market, and that access to transportation would free farmers from private tyranny in the form on transportation monopolies.</p>

<p>Yet many libertarians today reject infrastructure projects, even to the detriment of their stated principles. For example, if the federal government built an inexpensive means of accessing space, such as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring">Orbital Ring</a>, it would enable us to put solar panels into space so cheaply that we could produce electricity for 1/10 the cost of coal.</p>

<p>If the government funded such a project, and funded the satellites, they could earn perhaps a 50% return on their investment. Within a few years, the government could earn so much money from selling power that they could cut, and eventually limit taxes.</p>

<p>Most libertarians say &quot;taxation is theft&quot; but when I explain such a program to actually eliminate taxes, they object that it&#39;s &quot;big government.&quot; Which is worse, a robust federal government doing things that it does well, or the government stealing your money at gunpoint? Many who identify as libertarians have a hard time admitting that stealing your money at gunpoint is far worse.</p>
