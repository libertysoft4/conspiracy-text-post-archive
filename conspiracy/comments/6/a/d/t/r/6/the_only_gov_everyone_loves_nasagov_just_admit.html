        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There certainly is a chance the earth is flat. You can&#39;t deny the existence of Computer graphics. You can&#39;t say it&#39;s easy to tell whats CGI and whats real. Because it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>We know Zero G planes exist, could easily be faking the whole international space station. </p>

<p>What we don&#39;t know is Why.. and that seems to be enough for everyone to shy away from the subject. But just open your mind enough to realize that the chance is there. We have been lied to.</p>

<p>In a court of law you are only required to instill a reasonable doubt. I can argue that the doubt is very reasonable in this situation because of the large amount of money our favorite .gov receives every year. </p>

<p>for me the more research I do the higher the chance that the earth is flat becomes. Right now I&#39;m at about 99.9% certain the earth is not a globe.</p>

<p>Side note. How does the earth stay balanced if spinning through space? They tell us the molten core of earth is so heavy that what we do on the surface has no effect on the balance of the earth. However, no one has ever dug down below 8 miles! at that point the tools melted and were useless. So 8 miles deep, and the core is something like 6000 miles deep. So thats 5992 miles we haven&#39;t explored below us. The point being they don&#39;t know how heavy the core of the earth is.. it&#39;s all calculations which could be and probably are wrong.<br/>
The balance of the earth would be thrown off by large cities like New York and Los Angeles. Think of a car tire it has to be balanced or things start vibrating. even a few weights off and the car vibrates. Try it yourself make a globe and then stick some heavy weights on one side.. I wonder what happens. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have all kinds of questions.  But before you ask anything,  does your question remove the reasonable doubt that I just proved about the earth being flat? </p>

<p>I just want questions that can remove the reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Dont ask me &quot;well what about satellites and meteors ?&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s too big of a lie how could we keep it secret?&quot; Those questions aren&#39;t removing the doubt I just proved.  </p>

<p>and just so you know satellites are all CGI. Meteors are either land based weapons , or calderas which formed the &quot;craters&quot; and the too big of a lie one is the oldest distraction. It&#39;s not too big of a lie everything is compartmentalized and secret societies do exist. </p>

<p>Why would they? </p>

<p>Yes, because the atmosphere is made of gas which, like all matter, is subject to friction.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Get a glass of water and put it on a turntable (record player) and start the player. Give it a minute or two and then drop something into the water, you&#39;ll see it start circling. The water is experiencing friction with the edge of the glass and so begins to rotate with it, exactly like our atmosphere does with the Earth&#39;s surface. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All three are mathematically related. Buoyant force is the difference in weight of two volumes of different mediums. Weight is defined as mass (number of atoms*molecular weight) multiplied by the gravitational constant of where you are (roughly 9.81m/s in earth&#39;s gravity well). You can not have a buoyant force if their is no gravity. </p>

<p>Veritasium does a nice video on buoyancy and gravity.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/xdJwG_9kF8s?t=231">Fire in Zero-G</a></p>

<p>Additionally this buoyancy cop out completely ignores that you can place a heavy iron weight on top of a Styrofoam block and they will not switch places even.</p>

<p>The electric universe is a better explanation for the &quot;no gravity&quot; argument, but it is equally flawed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I was coming from the point of view that without density, buoyancy would not (necessarily) exist, that&#39;s why a paper boat floats on water and doesn&#39;t sink. I agree, however, that without the gravitational forces pulling down on the water, it would just fly everywhere and buoyancy would not necessarily exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the earth were flat, how would gravity work? I&#39;ve heard some strange and actually probable theories, including wormholes and such. I do think the main reason we can&#39;t go below 8 miles is because what&#39;s the point? A lot of man power and money goes into just 7 miles, if we actually went all the way what would we accomplish? I doubt there is a strong and long enough substance that would do such a thing, but if it were possible it would be an astounding feat to say the most.

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Tesla&#39;s Dynamic Theory of Gravity. My attempt to explain it: </p>

<p>No objects have mass, but get their energy through this ether. When an object collects this ether energy, it increases its amount of electromagnetic radiation, thus objects are attracted to the object with the highest radiation energy levels.   </p>

<p>This attraction occurs because due to these high energy levels an objects mass/momentum would increase. Objects distort their own time through their radiated own radiated energy.  So motion through space gives the illusion of time. So the larger the radiation level, the larger the mass/momentum/inertia, then the larger amount of time dilation. So an object drawing energy from this ether will slow down its time due to its levels of electromagnetic radiation energy. </p>

<p>With the inverse square law, electromagnetic forces and gravitational forces are both a function of mass/energy in relation to distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you aren&#39;t a significant enough force. You simple cannot create your own gravity by rolling up into a ball, especially while on the Earth. Sadly, Physics does not bend just because you want to reproduce and prove something that may or may not exist. Since you most likely weight less than the moon, or earth for that matter, you therefore cannot generate enough gravitational force to &quot;float&quot; on earth with gravity. You can try all you want&#39; but it simply won&#39;t work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the questions I had about many conspiracies (not even related to FE at first glance) all have pretty clear anwsers now I believe the Earth to be flat.</p>

<p>Like you said, the shady shit going on at NASA (since the start) is pretty much proven fact. It&#39;s not awknowledged by the mainstream, but a quick trip to youtube will verify (beyond a doubt) odd occurances or the norm rather than exception for NASA material.</p>

<p>They also could&#39;ve put this flat earth vs round earth debate to rest a long time ago by providing actual visual evidence, a simple photograph or video from outside of ISS panning around. That doesn&#39;t happen, because they can&#39;t yet, compare old ISS footage from current ISS footage.</p>

<p>As for your example, it&#39;s kind of flawed in the sense that the weight (and size) of cities is nothing compared to the supposed weight and size  of the Earth, they wouldn&#39;t have a meaningfull impact. Despite visually covering the landscape, the weight of roads/concrete foundation/cities can be neglected when looking at the Earth is a planetary body.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of other good examples (and experiments) that prove a flat Earth though.</p>

<p>Actual history disagrees with you. It was only during the enlightenment, when we began to discard the idea that we had inherent meaning ordained by God, that science actually took off and people dared to question religious doctrine about our place in the universe. <strong>It&#39;s the absence of apparent meaning that makes the search for it enticing.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will admit that I didn&#39;t do a great job of articulating my position.  Let me backtrack a bit and address the most important part of what you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s the absence of apparent meaning that makes the search for it worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point I am trying to make is that the so called &quot;standard model&quot; is predicated on a grand explosion and that order was created out of chaos over billions of years.  Our existence is random and meaningless, and we only experience this existence due to an infinitely unlikely scenario.  A scenario so unlikely that there is not a single other example in the entire observable universe.  Therefore it is pointless to search for the meaning of our existence because there is no true meaning to be discovered.  </p>

<p>This breeds moral relativism, atheism, solipsism, and nihilism.  These types of mindsets in mass are beneficial to those who wish to control/manipulate/enslave the masses.  A person with this mindset is more likely to perform an activity that they hate so long as the &quot;ends justify the means&quot; as they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got bored the other day and watched some flat earth videos on YouTube. Really, I just wanted to try and see some of the arguments, and get a sense as to why someone would believe the earth is flat. The big one was a doc called &quot;under the dome&quot; or &quot;beneath the firmament&quot; or something; too lazy to confirm title right now. </p>

<p>Anyway</p>

<p>There were some general arguments that I pretty quickly debunked, but which were used as arguments for a flat earth. Here are a couple.</p>

<p>1) Rockets fly at a curve when they launch into space. If the earth was curved, why don&#39;t they just shoot straight up? Rockets flying on a curve is proof that they fly to the edge, release the shuttle and land back to earth. As a proof that we live on a flat earth beneath a firmament, a hobbyist flew a rocket with a camera on it straight up into the air. At a certain altitude, it stopped, despite still having fuel. The experimenter&#39;s conclusion: it hit the top of the &quot;dome&quot; we live under. </p>

<p>Actual truth: in order to counteract both a) the rotational velocity of the earth and b) gravity, rockets must fly tangentially against the orbit of the earth. Which means they&#39;re essentially flying in a curve to &quot;break out of&quot; earth&#39;s atmosphere. When you fly straight up, you cannot generate enough velocity to counteract, and therefore break free of, the effects of earth&#39;s gravity. This is why the rocket stopped in the hobbyist&#39;s video. The force of the earth&#39;s gravity was too great. </p>

<p>Additionally, as you get closer to the top of a rotating sphere, the force needed to escape the orbital velocity increases (almost?) exponentially. Imagine drawing a line with your finger around the top of a sphere, and then one around the middle, near the equator. Which can you circle faster with your finger? The top of course. As the earth spins at a constant speed, there is more energy required to &quot;break the spin&quot; going on near the poles, so to speak. This is why most space stations are located as close to the center of the globe as possible (in US, pretty much all southern US--Florida and Texas being the big ones). The ones not far south generally first fly south in order to make it easier to escape the spin of the earth. </p>

<p>2) If we could ascend very high and &quot;float&quot; above earth, then come back down, why would we end up in the same place we landed? If the earth was rotating, shouldn&#39;t it spin beneath us, and then have us land in a different spot? This proves the earth is not spinning.</p>

<p>A) The idea we&#39;re dealing with here is called <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KvCezk9DJfk">centripetal force </a>. Again with the whole &quot;tangential&quot; idea here--we are rotating from the same fixed center point and our velocity is an extension of the energy from that center point. This is why the atmosphere stays with the earth as it spins, why satellites rotate the globe, and why we land in different spots.</p>

<p>3) Why is the atmosphere not extremely windy? If we are rotating at thousands of miles an hour shouldn&#39;t the air be moving that fast too? </p>

<p>Inertia seems to come into play here (I think that&#39;s the scientific term but I could totally be wrong--I&#39;m an agronomist!). Like the most simple example I can think of is if you are riding a bike and toss a baseball up into the air, the baseball will land a few feet in front of you just as you bike into it, at the same speed, almost as if you aren&#39;t moving at all. Why didn&#39;t it go up and then drop behind you? You&#39;re all objects moving together, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. The atmosphere is the same way.</p>

<p>3) We can&#39;t observe gravity, only its affects, therefore a belief in it is as hyperbolic and unfounded as a belief in God or fairies. Since scientists can&#39;t show us gravity under a microscope, there is no reason to trust what scientists say about gravity. </p>

<p>A: we are learning a lot more about gravity every few years, and it&#39;s getting weirder and weirder. Some scientists are starting to suggest it isn&#39;t actually a perfect constant, since some places of the globe have gravity &quot;anomalies&quot; where the force is either <em>slightly</em> greater or weaker. Parts of Canada and Siberia are coming to mind, though I&#39;ll have to google it later to confirm. But in general yes, gravity is a weird thing like dark matter or the gas giants or galactic energy highways that we don&#39;t really know for certain <em>what</em> it is. The only reason we came up with the idea of gravity is because we observed enough consistently enough to formulate the idea that there was some <em>force</em> that we could observe the affects of. </p>

<p>The atheist will tell you there is no evidence of God, while the believer will point to evidence everywhere. Meanwhile the agnostic will profess that we don&#39;t even know what empirical evidence we&#39;d need to even start <em>looking</em> for God. </p>

<p>Gravity is sort of like a mash up of all three of these? In a weird way. The evidence of gravity and laws of motion started suggesting we were on a globe, and then once we used the hypothesis we were on a globe, all the gravity stuff started making more sense and got proven even more, in this sort of runaway-of-understanding type jawn. Like an amputee with memory loss slowly learning he once had arms, even though he can&#39;t use them and can&#39;t remember how to. This is basically our science of gravity. Some people are looking for gravitons and like gravity particles, but it&#39;s not been the most fruitful endeavor. </p>

<p>We may never be able to empirically prove what gravity is the same way we can&#39;t empirically prove what God is--people can&#39;t even agree on all the &quot;effects&quot;.</p>

<p>That being said, the gravity model works better than anything I&#39;ve seen proposed by the FE folks. The grand catch-22 of the FE &quot;theory&quot; is that it a) wishes to believe our current understanding of science is a perpetual lie but also must b) use the trappings of science to prove an empirical FE reality. It can&#39;t do it. Apart from people talking about how they&#39;ve never seen the globe or flown on a rocket, there isn&#39;t much else to go on. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been to Africa either but that doesn&#39;t mean I think it&#39;s a soundstage. </p>

<p>Hope this helps. I can&#39;t believe I wrote all this and I doubt any FE people are going to read it, but I hope you do. Cheers. </p>

<p>The globe earth that we are force fed from birth doesn&#39;t work, but neither does the flat earth.  How does the flat earth model reconcile the existence of the south celestial pole?</p>
