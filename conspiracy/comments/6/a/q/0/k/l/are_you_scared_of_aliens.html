    <div class="md"><p>Scared? Of anal probes and egg harvesting?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like being afraid, which is why I choose to be brave.  Sometimes shit goes wrong and you&#39;re scared, but you choose to be brave to get through it.  Because nobody likes someone who screams about spiders and mice.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you&#39;re in the woods, you come face to face with a bear.  Sometimes you have to give birth to a child and you do it at home to avoid the probing (yes, afraid of probing, so I choose to avoid it at all costs). Sometimes you&#39;re sweetie gets shot in the face.  Sometimes you accidentally go down the double black diamond when you&#39;re a newb.  Sometimes you&#39;re sweet baby gets whooping cough.  Sometimes you eat too much brownie.</p>

<p>Be brave.  Also if you get visited or abducted by aliens (let&#39;s just assume for a minute that aliens are demons, and I&#39;m going to include the good looking blondes, too) I&#39;ve heard that calling (or if you&#39;re paralyzed, even thinking it) on Jesus Christ makes them leave/ends the abduction.  It&#39;s worth a shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One time I took an unknown concoction (I thought was mushrooms) but later came to believe contained ayahuasca.  For a long time I thought I knew the &quot;truth&quot; because of what I saw and heard during that trip.  Then later I realized that evil can disguise itself as good, and liars are liars.</p>

<p>For example, there is a &quot;nice&quot; lady down the block who lied to my face yesterday, and when I discovered the truth and brought it to her, she lied even more.  When I offered her hard copy proof, she didn&#39;t have time to look.</p>

<p>You seem pretty deep in with your Atlantis friends.  Consider the possibility that they are a bunch of lying liars.</p>

<p>I would assume they have always had the power/tech to influence humanity. Why would they choose now to do anything to endanger us?</p>

<p>Maybe like some speculation states they have been a hidden hand influencing us from the start either for benevolent aims or something more untoward. If this is the case then nothing changes apart from our perspective.</p>

<p>Basically they could wipe us out at any time I would assume and they haven&#39;t yet so I think were good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at how different species / races / cultures on Earth treat each other through history, I think one should absolutely be afraid of aliens if we found they existed and had the capability to reach us or affect us in any way.</p>

<p>But, in terms of the whole universe, events on Earth are a very small sample size on which to base assumptions. Maybe life elsewhere is all about love and helping one another, who knows? But without further information we should be prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>I personally think the universe is so vast that it&#39;s likely almost anything you can imagine is out there somewhere. </p>
