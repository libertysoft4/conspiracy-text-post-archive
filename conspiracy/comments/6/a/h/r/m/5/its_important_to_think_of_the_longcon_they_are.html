    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m almost 100% sure it&#39;s going to be Tulsi Gabbard.</p>

<p>You can expect to see more of her coming up. One of the members here did an awesome write up on her, detailing her membership of the CFR, the amount of airtime the media is giving her, her portrayal in the media, her visit to Syria, ect. </p>

<p>Does anybody know where that write up is? </p>

<p>Anyway she&#39;s my bet for the democratic puppet 2020. And after 4 years of trump, it will be most welcomed to the American people.</p>

<p>Plus, she&#39;s an attractive female and has a kind demeanor, she&#39;s very convincing. Think of tulsi as like the female version of Obama. Hell, they&#39;re both even from Hawaii...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely think Tulsi can win. I just don&#39;t think she is a big enough warmonger to get the support of the establishment neolibs and neocons. She isn&#39;t a corporatist and a interventionist. She also refused to support HRC and quit the DNC to support Bernie in the primary which probably ticked off the neoliberals even more. They will spin and make up issues that aren&#39;t relevant or are exaggerations.</p>

<p>She has only advocated for policies that were pro lgbt so i doubt that would be an issue. I think hrc&#39;s main issue was a lack of credibility and a lot of flip flopping based on what was politically convenient. </p>

<p>Clean up D.C.? I understand that people who voted for him would rather belive a lie than face reality, he is the swamp. He put more billionaires, bankers, corporate CEO&#39;s and lobbyists in power than Obama. He campaign was run and funded by the same kind of people he put in power. He was never people&#39;s candidate, it was just an act for gullible asleep people hungry for change. Obama was that candidate in 2008 and next one that comes after would probably be a woman with similar act. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The feels man... they always hit you wit the feels. Feels over reals.</p>

<p>If you operated in an emotional vacuum, you&#39;d be impervious to most kinds of manipulation. You&#39;d be able to view a information impassively, without being influenced by the accompanying chemical response aka emotions. I took this psychedelic called 2ci-Nbombe - in my teens and it rocked my socks. Amongst the other effects:</p>

<p>walls bleeding into the ceiling, this keening shrill sound in my head, disjointed thought processs, mild waves of euphoria.. </p>

<ul>
<li>there was a period where I fully lost the ability to feel anything. It was really fairly terrifying, I&#39;ve tried LSD on numerous occasions and other variations and never had the same effect. After I&#39;d breathed my way out of the fear, it was really rather interesting. Prior to that point, I&#39;d never realised my conscious thought was so closely attached to emotions. I could cycle through concepts and my thought stream with greater accuracy, as I was wholly unencumbered by any emotional baggage. 
This lasted for no less than 20 minutes, but in that time I did some of the best thinking I can remember. </li>
</ul>

<p>Haha so yeah.. in a roundabout way I&#39;m trying to stress the importance of impassivity when making your mind up. About anything really, but especially big tickets concepts like Politics and morality.</p>

Yeah man. I guess you could say that..</p>

<p>Never underestimate the power of psychedelics. 
Remember the wave of positivity and free thinking that characterised the 60s &amp; 70s? You can attribute a fair chunk of that  to mass experimentation with psychedelics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only recommend the HTC Vive and a gaming PC. You could build a great Ryzen-based rig in a console-sized case.</p>

<p>The Vive is great because it has roomscale. The best roomscale anyway.</p>

<p>And VR feels like you&#39;re inside the game. The sense of presence is surprising, like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced. </p>

<p>The weird part is that after a couple of hours of play in a really engaging game, and after you take the headset off and interact with the real world, you&#39;ll have a sort of tunnel vision, and at least for me, you may feel as though you&#39;re watching the world happen and are able to better separate emotions from actions. Make better decisions. The feeling is not unlike what I&#39;d imagine an out of body experience might be like, except you&#39;re right there for it. When having a conversation it&#39;s sort of like being Neo in the Matrix, being able to think before reacting in real time, as if you&#39;re brain is working very quickly and assessing the outcomes of your different options. That fades after an hour or two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they are grooming someone for 2020, they&#39;d be stupid not to. That&#39;s politics 101. All you&#39;ve done is predict the wisest course of events for democrats to take next election. But there won&#39;t be war, death, or stripping of liberties. They don&#39;t want that, they want docile people to rule over and the best way to do that is consistent safety with the threat of danger around every corner.</p>

<p>And the only person to blame for Trumps failure to get reelected is Trump. The campaign he ran works fine to get elected, but ruins most of your chance at reelection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to point out that we&#39;re not even 200 days into the first year of his term. By the time the 2020 elections start coming around, we&#39;ll not only have had the 2018 midterm elections (which should provide a good barometer for how Trump&#39;s voters feel about his performance), but also 3 or so YEARS of his presidency to evaluate whether he&#39;s made progress in making America great and fulfilling his promises. This applies to both his opponents and his supporters.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing, there is a slow drip-drip-drip of opponents (like me) slowly getting &quot;red pilled&quot; in various ways to seeing either (a) the total moral / political bankruptcy of the Democratic party, (b) that there may be something genuine to &quot;MAGA&quot;, or (c) both of the above. Whether or not (b) is true, (a) definitely is. Go over to T_D and you&#39;ll see it. Whereas someone disappointed with Trump definitely wouldn&#39;t go the other way. And I can guarantee you that the unstoppable &quot;white man bad!&quot; rhetoric on the left is not winning anyone over.</p>

<p>So sure, maybe they&#39;re grooming someone. But that person still has to run as a Democrat, a party which half (and growing) of the country hates and always will. Will Trump be able to win over other D voters with his actual job performance? Who knows, but it&#39;s certainly possible. That&#39;ll seal the ticket.</p>

<p>Also look at the performance of the stock market. As they say, past performance is no indication of future gains. But if this growth continues, or even if we stay above 2016 levels, money talks, bro/sis. Trump may even win over some of the business interests who opposed him for Clinton.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s how Europe and the UK are doing with Macron and Brexit, respectively.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also very difficult to unseat a sitting president. This is why it&#39;s a comparatively rare thing that presidents only get one term. You have to seriously fuck up, generally in some military sense, to open the door seriously to a challenger.</p>

<p>So, I see what you&#39;re saying, but it may not matter. The media is waning in its power over people, and if the mainstream / non-Trump TPTB faction wants to put someone up there, let them. But they&#39;ll potentially be fighting against the results of whatever timeline we&#39;re in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the stock market performance, for one. And I like that jobs do seem to be coming back in large numbers following his presidency, or at least in the economic climate he&#39;s creating / contributing to. I also like knowing that, for now, the USA will be protected from radical Islamists hiding in amongst immigrants and refugees. Some may disagree with the scope of that problem, in Europe for example. But it is clearly a very scary problem, at whatever scale.</p>

<p>But mostly I think I like the effect that he&#39;s having. I think the mainstream media is abhorrent and has been for years, and I like them freaking out. I can&#39;t stand toxic SJW&#39;s and I like them losing their shit, too. I like that working-class Americans have been politically activated and empowered to have a voice in American culture, because they&#39;re a part of this country too. And I like that deep state and globalist machinations are part of the majority of the national conversation now.</p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t like everything that&#39;s happening. I have concerns about national environmental issues and I don&#39;t think any president has a meaningful amount of power over the war machine (mostly because of the petrodollar). But I think the above are net positive effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that Putin had a hand in encouraging the Sander&#39;s campaign. It&#39;s more likely that Kremlin propaganda will push an unlikely outsider whilst demonising that outsider&#39;s democratic/republican opponent. My guess is that Al-Franken will run for President in 2020 with Tulsi Gabbard as the wild card. The same will probably happen on the republican side, unless the Kremlin considers them sufficiently destroyed by that point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly having Don Trump as president makes me second guess my disdain for ted cruz which I think goes along with your point.   (I was a republican voter in the past and had a hard time this election).  I am skeptical of Trump but I am more skeptical of the people that actively want him to fail.   </p>

<p>i&#39;d like to see Republicans put forward Condoleeza Rice.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>why should i care about trump being opposed and ousted in 2020?</p>

<p>i didn&#39;t vote for him, i voted for stein, but i preferred him over clinton since i had no doubt how she would govern and the evil she would do unopposed and under the cover of darkness, because she was the oligarch&#39;s chosen one (don&#39;t kid yourself, the republicans in the house and senate want exactly what she does--they all have the same masters and this why they only &quot;opposed&quot; obama on stupid dog and pony shit, not his 7 wars and his gleeful decimiation of the bill of rights with bills they helped draft).</p>

<p>but trump was an unknown, so there was at least a sliver of a chance he&#39;d follow through and hold the line...nope, he was either full of shit and had always blowing smoke up our asses or he folded like a cheap suit. doesn&#39;t really matter which it was. it was probably a little of both.</p>

<p>under trump, the march from inverted totalitarianism that we&#39;ve lived under since wilson and his CPI in 1917 to straight up totalitarianism contiues apace. this would have been the case regardless of who was elected from a main party (and likely any partymdue to real fear for their lives and the lives of their friends and family). the only difference is that trump is acting like a drunk macaque as he does his part, instead of a like steely-eyed, red-assed baboon with scary as fuck canines.</p>

<p>fwiw under wilson we were only an inch away from out and out totalitarianism. </p>

<p>the left/right dichotomy is a lie you are force fed from birth to kow you into being the author of your own enslavement. the only salvation is direct democracy. get over your quest for a messiah. jesus was a fictional character created by vespasian as a sick joke on the jews after he&#39;d crushed tbem like flies in 70AD. he gave them a messiah who hated jews. if it wasn&#39;t so sad, it&#39;d be hilarious.</p>

<p>if hicks in the plains states in 1900 could win at least some direct democracy in 27 states, we can win total direct democracy in every state and the federal govt. they faught military and private thug forces in an extremely asymetrical war too--the coal wars were ended after all when the federal govt dropped 2 bombs and leftover gas from WW1 on striking miners in 1921, but the miners won in the end.</p>

<p>&quot;what rough beast, its hour come at last, slouches toward bethlehem to born?&quot;</p>

<p>if you keep participating in the left/right-- &quot;this time it will be different&quot;-charade, that beast will be of your own making..</p>
