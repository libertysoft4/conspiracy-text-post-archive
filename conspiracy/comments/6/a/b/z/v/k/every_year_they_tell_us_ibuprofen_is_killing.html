<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/ibuprofen-regularly-one-week-heart-attack-risk-increase-painkillers-common-pills-nsaids-naproxen-a7725736.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/ibuprofen-regularly-one-week-heart-attack-risk-increase-painkillers-common-pills-nsaids-naproxen-a7725736.html</a></p>

<p>Everyone I know who&#39;s had a heart attack or heart problems has been taking Ibuprofen or a similar painkiller.  Every time it was me and not the doctor who had to explain to the person that if they stopped taking the painkiller they&#39;d probably be fine.</p>

<p>Instead we get fear-mongered about mild childhood viruses which give you spots and a runny nose for a week, while Ibuprofen-induced heart attacks are killing people every day.</p>

<p>For anyone out there who still thinks that Big Pharma actually cares about them, ask yourself why they haven&#39;t removed Ibuprofen from the shelves yet, they are happily killing people every single day, while trying to pretend that they care about you so you should take their toxic untested jabs.</p>

<p>As always follow the money, TPTB are not trying to protect you, just to harvest your money one way or the other.  By making you sick they can get a lot more money from you.  Ibuprofen is essentially the gateway drug, as by inducing a heart attack, the doctor then puts you on the &#39;heart attack prevention&#39; drugs for life.  </p>

<p>So all because you thought it was safe to take Ibuprofen for your toothache, you have a heart attack and then are left thinking you are dependent on other drugs to stay alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With vaccines we don&#39;t know as they are not being studied correctly.  The science needs to prove that they are safe, effective and necessary, but rigorous studies are avoided and assumption prevails.</p>

<p>Ibuprofen is most likely fine in children and most young adults, but there are a lot of unnecessary heart attacks the middle age crowd and upwards.  And it&#39;s not like Ibuprofen brings any huge benefits with it, painkillers aren&#39;t fixing problems, just temporarily masking them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) &quot;True&quot; polio was massively over diagnosed, and was never done so through actual viral testing. Today we know there are dozens of cases of sudden onset paralysis, that would have all been classified as polio during the 1950s.</p>

<p>2) as soon as mass vaccination began the diagnostic criteria was tightened considerably, causing a drop in &quot;confirmed cases.&quot; which drones point to as proof the vaccines worked. If no vaccine was developed and we simply changed the criteria there would have still been a drop in cases. </p>

<p>3) children are still paralyzed to this day from a variety if different things, we just don&#39;t call it polio like we 100% would have pre vaccine. </p>

<p>4) for more than 95% of people infected with polio virus, no symptoms were present. </p>

<p>5) during the cutter incident after 200,000 people were vaccinated, 40,000 contracted polio, 200 of which suffered paralysis, and ten died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i work in the industry and i would say this. Ibuprofen is a better option than tylenol (which overtime can damage your liver) or opiate pain killers. Unfortunately, the pain signalling in our brain is a very specific chemistry and only certain active ingredients can alter its signalling. Ibuprofen is the lesser of many evils. Also the reason there isnt much testing is because the FDA has a submission for drugs that existed prior to the FDA, which allows a quick pass and no clinical trials required. Finally, there are many manufactures of Ibuprofen and its yet to be seen if maybe the damage can be linked to 1 or several specific manufacturers who processes are faulty or their suppliers are giving them poor active pharmaceutical ingredients. If Ibu was pulled off the shelves or opioid epidemic would skyrocket because arent many viable substitutes of pain relief, especially minor chronic pain</p>

    <div class="md"><p>also, i will say that we should probably be more concerned on how experimental opiates that are govt. controlled end up in heroin. U-47700 is a federally scheduled class 1 narcotic that can not be manufactured anymore because of its extreme potency. The only entity that can store it is the government. Yet it has ended up mixed with Heroin, Fentanyl and Carfenafil for a drug known now as &quot;Grey Death&quot;</p>
