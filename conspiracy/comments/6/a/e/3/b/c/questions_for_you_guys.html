<li>By awakening yourself then passing on knowledge in breadcrumb form. That&#39;s the most important because it&#39;s a lot of stuff to comprehend and to put into perspective all of it in one shot on an uninitiated is simply too much. They also need to be pretty open minded.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Here I&#39;m going to assume by awaken you mean reading up on all the crazy stuff the elites have done in the past and trying to figure out all the holes in the story. Research is key, only ourselves can figure out our own path. I would say research on subjects you have questions on, and the rest will follow suit as you find more questions to be asked.</p>

<p>9/11 is an easy start, lots of inconsistencies in the official narrative and observable facts or evidence, you present yourself with the evidence presented forward by a) the government and take their perspective and try to see if the story works with the events, then B) see what the counter argument is and try to determine with more research who&#39;s telling the truth. The same can be applied to a lot of stuff up to current events</p>

<p>Glad to have you asking questions and researching it&#39;s the way to go. Be warned there is a lot of disinformation out there and it&#39;s hard to make out the truth, cross reference everything. Keep in mind everything you learn as a potential dot of information that can be linked to something else. Conspiracy theories are a gigantic web of information and you really gotta &quot;zoom out&quot; your perspective to get a good grasp.</p>

<p>But you gotta start somewhere before straight up jumping into aliens I believe. I&#39;ve always been a skeptic as in &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s people out there&quot; but connecting the dots turned it into &quot;Holy fuck I can&#39;t wait to talk to a real one&quot; in a matter of weeks</p>

<p>If you have more questions I&#39;m often around</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are talking about spirituality and the nature of the universe I recommend studying The Uncertainty Principle, Kundalini, Holofractals, Power of Intention, Schumann Resonance. These are the deepest levels of my understanding and seem to make things insignificant in comparison. Don&#39;t take my word for it though. Go explore for yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li>pieces of advice. </li>
</ol>

<p>1.DO NOT open Pandora&#39;s box if you aren&#39;t prepared to deal with what you find. </p>

<p>2.Don&#39;t get lost in the rabbit holes, love life and live it. </p>

<p>3.Don&#39;t get glued to the microscope there is always a bigger picture. </p>

<li>Start throwing little tips of confirmed conspiracies, you can find some in the sidebar. Just drop little pills here and there to specific people. Then start talking about what you believe to be true. For instance, I just got my coworker to believe that JFK was not murdered by  Lee Harvey Oswald after telling him the truth about the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>to be clear, i do not believe that aliens are in contact with humanity.</p>

<p>i just believe that they <em>must</em> exist, simply by virtue of how ENORMOUS the universe is.</p>

<p>just look at this <a href="http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/heic1411a.jpg">picture</a></p>

<p>this is the hubble &quot;ultra deep field&quot; photograph. they took a picture with a very long exposure time of a small section of the night sky, that would be about one pixel if the entire night sky were a computer screen.</p>

<p>every single one of those points of light in that picture is a GALAXY. </p>

<p>each galaxy has ~200,000,000,000 stars.</p>

<p>there are billions of galaxies <em>that we can see</em></p>

<p>when you think about those numbers, in my mind at least, i find myself thinking &quot;how could there NOT be other intelligent life somewhere out there&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a lurker here for many years now. I&#39;ll be 20 at the end of this month. </p>

<p>Enjoy your youth, man. Don&#39;t worry about all this shit right now. I started a little younger than you, and it helped me grow and become who I am today. My only regret is not living out a fulfilling childhood because I was too preoccupied with what was happening. </p>

<p>If this is the route in which you want to take yourself, then that&#39;s fine. Be smart, be cautious, and don&#39;t believe everything you read here. </p>

<p>Look at each side of every coin. </p>

<p>Maybe aliens do exist, and maybe they don&#39;t. Aliens could exist on a spherical earth surrounded by a never ending universe, or they&#39;re made up so we don&#39;t think so much on the fact that WE ARE the only lifeforms living out our existence on a flat dimension that we call &quot;earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe god is real, but more than likely not properly explained by any modern day religion. I&#39;m a spiritual guy, certainly not religious. Maybe god isn&#39;t real, and we are a byproduct of chance that grew to form consciousness. </p>

<p>No theory is too crazy to believe. We haven&#39;t even explored most of our planet. We don&#39;t know if there are hidden technologies to produce clones, we don&#39;t know if the earth is actually round, we don&#39;t know that queen Elizabeth is not a reptilian, we don&#39;t know if the earth is hollow, and we certainly don&#39;t know who/what control this planet. </p>

<p>As for &quot;awakening&quot; those around you, you must realize that is no easy feat. Someone who has been asleep since their birth and their mind closed so tight may never wake up, even with proof of something slapping them in the face. You can not &quot;awaken&quot; someone who doesn&#39;t want to be woken up. You can&#39;t convince someone of something if they don&#39;t want to listen. I have made many friends open their eyes to new truths because they were open minded and I presented the information in ways to get their gears going. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;dropping bits and pieces&quot; because they won&#39;t follow a trail of crumbs if they don&#39;t want to. It&#39;s about deep conversation with information ready to present and knowledge on both sides of the argument. Remember, never say no. It&#39;s always &quot;yes, and&quot; to show their point is valid but there is more to their point that actually ties in to your own. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to see a young person, such as yourself, interested in finding what is inside of them, and opening their eyes to what could be true. Remember, we are soldiers. We are in the middle of a war right now. Coming soon, lives may be lost of our regime. We are the Seers, and those of power do not like how much we see, and how convincing we can be. </p>

<p>Stay vigilant, OP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1: They are actually demons or fallen angels, we&#39;ve just had the truth twisted.<br/>
2:Yes, God is real.<br/>
3:Never disregard anything, I don&#39;t have to believe it but the futher you go, the more you realise anythings possible.<br/>
4:Be yourself.  Enjoy life.  Be a good person.  Let them see your example.  No need to freak them out by telling them things they&#39;re not ready to hear.  In time, ask them what they think about this idea or that idea.  Slowly, slowly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) yes, it would be arrogant of us to think we&#39;re alone in the universe. Extra demesiononal beings-yes, but reluctantly as the thought terrifies me.
2) yes, I&#39;m Wiccan, so I believe in lots of them
3) the flat earth theory, lizard people
4) as an opener, look for Zeitgeist on YouTube and let them watch it. I&#39;ve found this to be effective a couple of times now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Question 1: do you believe in aliens and/or extra dimensional entities?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, but I don&#39;t know anything about them but statistically speaking I believe its probably for them to be somewhere out there is some capacity. How far along would the dinosaurs be if they didn&#39;t get eradicated? </p>

<p><strong>Question 2: Do you believe in a God or higher being/s? (Plz just yes or no. I don&#39;t want a religious debate in the comments)</strong></p>

<p>Yes but he/she/it/they/etc don&#39;t give a fuck about us. </p>

<p><strong>Question 3: What are some theories that you believe to be batsh*t crazy?</strong>
Flat Earth, Lizard people. </p>

<p><strong>Question 4: I&#39;m 14 how do I help &quot;awaken&quot; my family and friends?</strong> 
Not your job. Just gather information and if you wind up on the subject have a little extra to add. </p>
