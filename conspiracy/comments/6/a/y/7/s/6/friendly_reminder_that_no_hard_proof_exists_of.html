    <div class="md"><p>Ok let&#39;s use some logic here. </p>

<p>Hillary loses election unexpectedly after most people who voted for her did it because &quot;she deserves it&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s her turn&quot;. Next, rumors are peddled that Russia had something to do with the election. MSM outlets (who were known to be pushing an agenda against trump in order to get Hillary elected at all costs) peddle the anti Russia narrative, relying on sourcing intelligence agencies the entire time. Intelligence agencies come out with a 15 page report after months of &quot;investigation&quot; where half of it was bashing RT, a legitimate news network with the right to push its own agenda, which is often sourced and truthful information (Abby Martin&#39;s &#39;Breaking the set&#39;) and the rest of the report lacked any real credible facts that could link Russia to any real interference in the election. </p>

<p>All we have are former Obama White House officials illegally unmasking American citizens on trump&#39;s campaign discussing things (that weren&#39;t even made public) with the Russian ambassador. An unsourced and liked fake &#39;dossier&#39; came out that obviously had the purpose of humiliating trump, with absolutely no facts to back up any of the claims. How do I know it was bullshit? Because if it wasn&#39;t, the MSM would have taken the opportunity to get trump out and expose him <em>as much as possible</em>. This is the best they could do. And it wasn&#39;t enough. </p>

<p>Recognize when you&#39;re being manipulated into believing a fake story. Libya. Syria. 9/11. All fake. They didn&#39;t have the time to plan out this Russia bullshit, so this one is particularly sloppy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pictures were popularized last summer of Michael Flynn at a RT dinner sitting next to Putin and sharing a table with Jill Stein. He was paid 30K to give a speech there as well. </p>

<p>Manafort has a long history of some shady shit. He was working for Victor Yanukovych for 8 years secretly to improve his image in the West and win election in Ukraine. Yanukovych is Putin&#39;s friend and has financial ties to the other oligarchs who run Russia as well.</p>

<p>It was thought that Manafort only earned about 80k in a 6 month period working for them in 2008. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html?_r=0">But 12 million n payments was earmarked for Manafort&#39;s firm in a uncovered ledger..</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. There is certainly some things not right, but it&#39;s hardly comparable to the millions exchanged through the Clinton cabal.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s time that we as a collective people set aside our differences and get the TRUTH public. Because while this doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s on the same scale of corruption as the Clinton cabal, it is still likely some business that the normal people would not be okay with. We need to create a new system of &quot;government&quot; that actually serves and protects the people without infringing on their rights. We need to start over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She stole the election from Bernie, plain and simple. I don&#39;t care about where the emails may have come from, as long as the truth came out.</p>

<p>But the point is, its <em>impossible</em> to prove that Russia hacked it. Because anyone can simply cover their tracks with any other nation&#39;s hacking tools to make it look like it was any other nation. No proof + no ability to obtain proof + constant MSM peddling = distraction propaganda</p>

<p>Reference Number: JAR-16-20296A December 29, 2016 GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity</p>

<p>Summary
This Joint Analysis Report (JAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). <strong>This document provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS) to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. Government, political, and private sector entities.</strong> The U.S. Government is referring to this malicious cyber activity by RIS as GRIZZLY STEPPE.
Previous JARs have not attributed malicious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors. <strong>However, public attribution of these activities to RIS is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.</strong> This determination expands upon the Joint Statement released October 7, 2016, from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security.
This activity by RIS is part of an ongoing campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. government and its citizens. These cyber operations have included spearphishing campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations leading to the theft of information. In foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical infrastructure networks. <strong>In some cases, RIS actors masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack.</strong> This JAR provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, recommended mitigations, suggested actions to take in response to the indicators provided, and information on how to report such incidents to the U.S. Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, since JFK or even just 9/11, has any president <em>really</em> been <em>proven</em> to be &quot;telling the truth&quot;?</p>

<p>He stopped the TPP, that&#39;s still something I can maintain that I&#39;m happy with that I think we can all have confidence that Hillary wouldn&#39;t have done. </p>

<p>And he&#39;s making obamacare go away. And hopefully he will get the new tax stuff going too, so I don&#39;t have to give as much money to the system. I don&#39;t care what he does to the rich, the rich live in a completely different world where they control the scarcity, so Idk what will happen, and I don&#39;t want to debate this stuff with you, but <em>personally</em> I&#39;m happy with these things. I&#39;m not happy with everything, by any means, if I had it my way, they&#39;d all be out of office, intel agencies shut down, and secrets made public. But we all know that won&#39;t happen until we, the people take matters into our own hands and overthrow the system with FACTS.</p>

<p>But that ain&#39;t gonna happen anytime soon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All we know for fact is Micheal flynn was a foreign agent for Turkey before the election and as NSA director. Even if all the rest is bs the fact he was able to infiltrate the WH should be a huge red flag that they could&#39;ve missed others shady business. You have to at least admit that right? I actually don&#39;t think Trump knew anything in detail about the situation. I personally don&#39;t think he could explain any policy in detail.

<p>I&#39;ll buy that. I probably agree with Flynn on most politics, but you&#39;re delusional if you think you&#39;re going to take foreign money and keep a clearance (unless you&#39;re the Clintons). I don&#39;t even care about RT, but writing a pro-Erdoğan op-ed shows you&#39;ve been doing business with the wrong team. He may just be greedy and not necessarily compromised, but we&#39;ll have to see what else comes out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s hard to tell. Trump could have not known anything, or he could have been concealing the information. The Flynn situation wasn&#39;t explained in detail, the call he had wasn&#39;t even made public, so we don&#39;t even know how bad it was.</p>

<p>Please explain more of the Turkey stuff for me, and was that before or after the &quot;attempted coup&quot; last summer?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone knows where Trump is in all of this, so I find it unproductive to speculate about what goes on in Trump&#39;s head. He could be fooling a bunch of people, who knows. I don&#39;t bookmark every Trump speech I see, so I don&#39;t remember anything specific from him talking about policy, but it depends on each of our definition of &quot;coherent&quot; anyway, so it wouldn&#39;t be productive to discuss something like that either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the basics are flynn got paid through a consulting firm over a half million to lobby for the dictator there. He didn&#39;t disclose this until after he was fired from being the NSA. So the whole time during the campaign the presidents nation security confidant and advisor is working for Turkey. Then he&#39;s hired as the Nation security advisor for the WH and didn&#39;t disclose so he&#39;s a spy now and should be charged for treason really. The crazy thing is the transition don&#39;t vet flynn and just trusted him to tell the truth. At the least it&#39;s criminal neglect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Like I said, it&#39;s hard to tell. He could have just been a greedy motherfucker, but he could have had more nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just hard to tell because when a situation like Hillary&#39;s private server is exposed to the extent George Webb did, and similar dots haven&#39;t been connected in the cases like Flynn&#39;s where you can track where the money is coming from and likely for what purposes. That&#39;s what makes me think that Flynn was likely just a slimey greedy bitch. That is if all of this wasn&#39;t just MSM manipulation, like much of what is made of the Russia story.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s her turn&quot;, you say like you don&#39;t comprehend that was a lazy ass propaganda smear adapted from &quot;it&#39;s his turn&quot; - a meme mocking Mitt Romney that became popular during the previous election after he was recorded saying &quot;it&#39;s my turn&quot; (he was actually talking about speaking - someone was interrupting them and he was telling them it was his turn to speak).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next, rumors are peddled that Russia had something to do with the election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, that happens &quot;next&quot; does it?  Presumably you will explain the origins of the time machine used to go back and publish this statement in October, prior to the election.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national</a></p>

<p>I read it contemporaneously.  Media did report it at the time.  If you know nothing of this, if you never heard anything about Russia&#39;s involvement until after the election, that says something about the media you rely on for your information.  At the best it is withholding very important information from you.</p>

<p>But if you got the notion that accusations about Russia only started after the election from your chosen sources of information, then this is worse than merely withholding information from you.  They&#39;re feeding you false information if they told you that.</p>

<p>So can you?  Can you recognize when you&#39;ve been fooled, hoodwinked, taken for a ride, made into someone elses useful idiot so you can spread their lies for them, let yourself be turned into someone elses propaganda machine.  Can you recognize when you&#39;re being made a fool of?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Project Monarch and the hypnotizing effects of the frequencies put out by our televisions. Being in a constant Alpha brainwave state makes people less critical and easy to influence. Personal observations, I&#39;m not a scientist. However, our whole world view is built upon the idea that there is always an authority figure in our life. The television news is portrayed as the authority on information. Just think about it, from birth there is always someone who &quot;knows better&quot; than us and is willing to tell us the &quot;correct&quot; answer. They don&#39;t want to help you speculate and come to your own conclusions. In school there are books and if your answer isn&#39;t &quot;correct&quot;(in regards to history, politics, not things such as math) you are &quot;wrong&quot; and all the connotations that come with that label and feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich was a leaker who was murdered, Hillary had motive and a long history of suspicious deaths behind her, and her campaign chair said they should &quot;make an example&quot; of the leaker.  I can&#39;t think of a more likely scenario that fits those facts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the whole &quot;Ze Russians&quot; narrative was made up by Hillary&#39;s campaign, and has been pushed by the MSM despite a complete and total lack of evidence.  Also, Russia and America haven&#39;t been at war for thirty years, and have been allies for most of that time.   Who on this sub is stupid enough to fall for such obvious propaganda?  A lot of people, apparently.</p>

<p>Something which again, has no hard proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>complete and total lack of evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there was a complete and total lack of evidence, the investigations would have stopped. Unless you think somehow Clinton is still secretly in control of it all, which is absurd, because if she had that kind of power she could have forced the investigation to make stuff up earlier and kill Trumps campaign. It&#39;s also absurd to think she <em>still</em> holds that kind of power, given that she lost; she doesn&#39;t have any political capital any more. </p>

<p>Also, if there was a complete and total lack of evidence, people on Trump&#39;s staff or cabinet wouldn&#39;t have been lying about it right up until they quit or were fired after that evidence you claim doesn&#39;t exist came to light. Remember Manafort? Remember Flynn? Remember all those people who claim to have never met with any Russians ever until pictures of them with Kislyak or Putin or both came out? It&#39;s absurd that this sub believes anything someone says about Clinton, but never anything about Trump. It&#39;s clear partisanship and has been since early 2016.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/fbi-russia-hacking-dnc-crowdstrike/">http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/fbi-russia-hacking-dnc-crowdstrike/</a></p>

<p>Heh, but you dare call people out for spewing propaganda. Facts you don&#39;t like do not equal propaganda. I have done a preliminary search and can not find anything on an image being provided. Just that they relied on third party information. If they were provided this image, how can they verify it is authentic? That is the whole point of wanting physical access.</p>

The only way we can ever go to war with Sierra is if Russia is the bad guy.  No matter what you think of trump, you mark my words.. They day he goes down for this is the day we invade Sierra, and likely the circumstances will be just as dubious as every other time they&#39;ve sent us to war on a lie.</p>

Because Washington DC and the establishment in general hate Donald Trump, and will do anything to get him out of power, that&#39;s why.  Like it or not he wasn&#39;t supposed to win and he represents an existential threat to their power structure.</p>

I cautiously got behind <em>some</em> of Trump&#39;s actions early on after the election when it looked like he might have actually had a backbone against the entrenched power structure, but ever since Kushner and Ivanka gained more power in the WH and Trump began hardcore flipping on even his moderate/centrist positions, it&#39;s hard to see him as any different from Obama, Bush, the Clintons or any other puppet of the ruling Cabal.</p>

<p>All it took for me was to hear he was running, but I&#39;ve always been pessimistic, so I never had any hope for him.  I hoped he&#39;d at least have a somewhat cabinet that helped him run things, but he&#39;s not even capable of finding people to make suggestions thst would make the country better. I dont like hillary, but in the same situation she would at least have been a decent politician, even if she was only in it for herself.</p>

<p><em>The Jesuits were created by the Venetian / Papal Bloodlines of the Mystery Babylon and are the military/intelligence arm of the NWO, not the true powers themselves; although they are frequently described as such, even the Jesuit Superior General bends the knee to the true Bloodline families of the Justinians and Amun-Ra priesthood.</em></p>

<p>Jesuits, bloodlines and priesthood of Amun Ra. Good.</p>

<p>Trump and Russia. Bad. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you can justify it in your mind that we shouldn&#39;t be talking about Trump/Russia because there is no hard evidence but you turn around and post dozens of Illuminati and bloodlines conspiracies that have <em>zero</em> evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is right in a way. It started with the emails talking about spirit cooking. Just because it was heavily researched on image boards does not mean it originated from there. A lot of the initial investigation involved doxxing and other things that would be wiped from most forum boards. </p>

<p>I mention spirit cooking because I am sure you were going to retort with script #5, Cheese pizza = 4 chan, thus pizzagate = 4chan, case closed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats your stance on dyncorp? They are a part of pizzagate too, and have been publicly shamed and called out for human trafficking by a senator. Pizzagate has always been a movement to stop state sanctioned human trafficking. No amount of trying to focus it on a pizza parlor will change that. The clinton foundation is dirty in regards to this. Have you checked out George Webb&#39;s video&#39;s on this topic? They are well put together and if you&#39;re curious about it all I would recommend checking it out. </p>

<p>If I knew victims of human trafficking I would take them to the authorities of course! Why even bring that up? Is that some attempt to discredit the theory because no victim has stepped forward yet?

<p>Really, who talks like this? If they were your friends kids you wouldn&#39;t list their ages. If they were random make a wish foundation kids, since they don&#39;t sound related, a normal person doesn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t refer to them as entertainment, whole listing their ages. Then you have tons of emails where Podesta is using pizza, cheese, and other words, which pedophiles have a history of using as codes, that don&#39;t make any sense in context and are highly suspect emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposed secret code within the contents of his emails. And just general oddness, the biggest red flag was one where Tamera Luzzatto ( former chief of staff to Senator Hillary Rodham ) sent to him about young children being in a pool for his entertainment, &quot; Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and  almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in  that pool for sure.&quot;
 (LINK: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</a>).</p>

<p>Granted, these are what appears to be her step grandkids, however it&#39;s just weird wording &quot;for your entertainment.&quot; Tamera Luzzatto also apparently had a blog that said you can spend time with Evie, a newborn baby  &quot;raw and uncut&quot; (LINK: <a href="https://i.redd.it/dujvrwj3mzfy.jpg">https://i.redd.it/dujvrwj3mzfy.jpg</a>)</p>

<p>Again, an odd thing to say about a newborn... Again, no hard evidence, just lots of suspicion and weirdness surrounding them. </p>

<p>Though other interesting Podesta emails talk about ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence) and the vatican...</p>

<p>Pizzagate was not created by 4 chan.</p>

<p>Did 4chan get Jon pedoesta to write/revive this email.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/JJC1o">http://archive.is/JJC1o</a></p>

<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want.</p>

<p>Or this one?</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/JBft7">http://archive.is/JBft7</a></p>

<p>Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>

<p>Or this one?</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/9PcWi">http://archive.is/9PcWi</a></p>

<p>Still in torture chamber</p>

<p>Obviously these emails have a hidden meaning and this intruiged people enough to dig for more coded emails.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how they came across Alenfantis and comet ping pong who was posting pictures like this on his Instagram.</p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@rebelskum/james-alefantis-once-public-instagram-jimmycomet-now-preserved-on-steemit-blockchain">https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@rebelskum/james-alefantis-once-public-instagram-jimmycomet-now-preserved-on-steemit-blockchain</a></p>

<p>And books bands like this to play at his family freindly restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo</a></p>

<p>Lovely family friendly band there joking pedophilla and killing babies.</p>

<p>Now judging by the instagram pictures Joking about killing babies seems to be a theme here.</p>

<p>So tldr you are wrong pizzagate was not created by 4chan.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for government transparency. There&#39;s too much unknown right now, but the Republican party as a whole has been the least transparent apparatus in government I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>If they have nothing to hide, they&#39;d be releasing as much info as they could. Not preventing investigations at all costs.</p>

<p>And these things take time. I think you&#39;ll see more of Russian GOP money laundering though.</p>

<p>It also stands to reason that after 8+ months including 5 with a controversial Administration in power with huge amounts of leaks, something definitive and concrete would come out to bury Trump hard with proof of collusion, wouldn&#39;t it?  Yet there&#39;s nothing but the Pissgate document that got BuzzFeed laughed out of a Press Corp and personal business and lobbying deals with Flynn/Manafort and possibly Page that are probably no different from any other routine government corruption, because these people are ALL thieves and liars.  It&#39;s just being blown tremendously out of proportion with Trump because the entire DC establishment and media apparatus hates him because <em>it was HER turn</em> and Trump fucked all that up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP doesn&#39;t identify with either party, is registered Independent and has pretty centrist views with left-leaning personal / social views, but ok guy.  It&#39;s called having a nuanced viewpoint, able to call out either side for their bullshit and give credit when it&#39;s (rarely) due when they actually do their jobs as &quot;public servants&quot;.  I rightfully treat any blatant political push of opinion and propaganda from known political hacks in the MSM as incredibly suspect, and likely lying to push an agenda.  These are discredited liars who exposed their bias and their hand throughout the 2016 election on BOTH sides.  A cursory look at history proves them to be mouthpieces for the CIA and other IC agencies, and supporting <em>anything</em> they want is a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Yes Nance has a decorative background but when he goes on shows like MSNBC and repeats their talking points, he has lost all credibility. He supported Hillary for fks sake!</p>

<p>Pushing fake news claiming wikileaks publishes fake emails. This guy is a Clinton/Obama minion. He retweets articles from Salon, Politico, NYT, Slate, WaPo, MSNBC and CNN which makes him a political hack.</p>

<p>Obviously, you are correct. There is no direct correlation between Donald Trump and any Russian Agent.</p>

<p>After Flynn left, of course. You know him, the Top Security Advisor with access to everything Secret the US has? The one who DEFINITELY has direct connection to Russia?</p>

<p>Oh but I am SURE that President The Donald&amp;trade; and Mikie Flynn NEVER EVER discussed anything about Russia, now did they, cousin?

Whatever the current situation is they craft a headline that runs counter to that and upvote it in droves.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the opinion that the Anti-trump posts are legitimate news at this point. Jeff Sessions said some dumb shit about drugs, the FCC chairman really does want to fuck up net neutrality, Trump did fire the head of the FBI while his administration is being investigated etc etc etc. These are all real stories the counter-assualt is attempting to wag the dog and bring nothing new to the table. </p>

<p>I think Trump supporters are not used to being in power and accountable for that power, Trump is the president now and if he fucks up there is no one else to shift the blame to. It will be interesting to see if this sinks in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is that there&#39;s not enough proof to substantiate the claims that Russia interfered with our election or colluded with the Trump Administration.  Anonymous sources and political hackery from sources that blatantly shilled and supported the political opposition should be looked at with <em>obvious skepticism</em> of a higher motive to discredit a hated political opponent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we can both agree here that the DNC are using &#39;Russia hacking the election&#39; as a scapegoat for why they failed, so the DNC doesn&#39;t have appear responsible for their loss, which I think we can both agree that they should take responsibility.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> though, I find it hard to believe anyone here would reasonably be convinced that Russia hacked the election and made the DNC lose by doing so. By &quot;just saying&quot; there is no evidence, you are implying that people are not only stupid enough to believe that Russia was behind the hacks and caused the DNC to lose, but you are also implying that people are stupid enough to simply believe your &quot;there is nothing to see here&quot; statement. Let people see the lack of substantial evidence, and the agendas of each news outlet, and let them come to their conclusions themselves, otherwise, let them be sceptical of Wikileaks agendas, if any. If you are so confident there is no substantial evidence, you don&#39;t need to &quot;just say&quot; anything. Like I said, this isn&#39;t <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, no one is going to be taken seriously if they say &quot;Russia hacked the election because CNN told me&quot;.</p>
