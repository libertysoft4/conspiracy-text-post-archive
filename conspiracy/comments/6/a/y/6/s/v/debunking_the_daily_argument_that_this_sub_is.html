        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/InfoDisseminator.html">InfoDisseminator</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see this argument thrown around in here every day. People claim that pro-Trump bots are manipulating the content here. Some claim this sub is overflowing with pro-Trump alt righters who downvote anything anti-Trump. It&#39;s complete nonsense. </p>

<p>To start, are there <em>any</em> Trump supporters in here? Of course there are. Why would they not be? Trump has support from like 40 percent of the US population. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nation-tracker-poll-does-trump-support-have-a-ceiling-or-a-floor/">About 20 percent are full Trump supporters, 20 percent are somewhat supportive, another 20 percent oppose him somewhat, and 40 percent percent are anti-Trump.</a></p>

<p>Given this, we should expect that some anti-Trump threads hit the front page of this sub, and some pro-Trump threads do as well. This is exactly what we see happening, except some people are ignoring all of the anti-Trump threads and pushing a fake talking point that these threads don&#39;t exist. There are tons of people in here who push literal mainstream media talking points that get massive upvotes, occasionally gilded, while claiming they will be downvoted for being anti-Trump. If anything, we should expect that mainstream media talking points won&#39;t be received well here since this is a conspiracy sub, but these talking points get upvotes and gold. </p>

<p>Top post this week is the current top post. &quot;I&#39;m fucking TIRED of the fucking WAR on drugs. Jeff Sessions Demands &quot;Strongest Possible Charges&quot; For Drug Users. Fuck Jeff Sessions, and Fuck the War on Drugs&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6awhsy/im_fucking_tired_of_the_fucking_war_on_drugs_jeff/?st=j2ndg2p6&amp;sh=61617e28">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6awhsy/im_fucking_tired_of_the_fucking_war_on_drugs_jeff/?st=j2ndg2p6&amp;sh=61617e28</a></p>

<p>I looked at the 2nd top thread for this week. It&#39;s a bit of a neutral thread, not necessarily pro or anti-Trump, but lets take a look at the comments:</p>

<p>One of the highest upvoted comments, and most of the comments that followed, claimed there was an ulterior motive for Trump firing Comey (covering up a conspiracy with Russia.)</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/</a></p>

<p>The most upvoted comment claimed &quot;paid shills are downvoting this juicy conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/</a></p>

<p>Another top comment was deleted, but I recovered it. It claims the FBI are going to start leaking dirt on Trump to the press.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/KiAuA">http://archive.is/KiAuA</a></p>

<p>The comments are completely full of anti-Trump users with massively upvoted comments. </p>

<p>Another anti-Trump thread:</p>

<p>Upvoted to almost 4,000 points: &quot;Michael Flynn resigns: Trump&#39;s national security adviser quits over Russia links.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5txzbc/michael_flynn_resigns_trumps_national_security/?st=j2mm8gbv&amp;sh=c38fdfb0">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5txzbc/michael_flynn_resigns_trumps_national_security/?st=j2mm8gbv&amp;sh=c38fdfb0</a></p>

<p>Same thing. The comments are full of anti-Trump conspiracy theorizing. </p>

<p>This one was stickied for a while: &quot;Let me explain exactly how Trump is a Rothschild asset and has been for decades. How his advisers, policies, alternative media talking heads all emanate from the Cabal, via Rothschild financial influence. We&#39;ll begin with Alex Jones and make our way down.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/let_me_explain_exactly_how_trump_is_a_rothschild/?ref=search_posts">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/let_me_explain_exactly_how_trump_is_a_rothschild/?ref=search_posts</a></p>

<p>Even on pro-Trump threads, the comments typically swing anti-Trump. Here&#39;s one that was upvoted to 648 and gilded: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68y3ez/hillary_clinton_just_called_wikileaks_russian/dh2jvtl/?st=j2ndo2wc&amp;sh=2e1deff0">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68y3ez/hillary_clinton_just_called_wikileaks_russian/dh2jvtl/?st=j2ndo2wc&amp;sh=2e1deff0</a></p>

<p>Many other highly upvoted comments claim this sub is like T_D, very right wing, etc. Then how did you get upvoted? </p>

<p>a single post hitting their pre-planned talking point on 18k+, they don&#39;t care how stupid they sound. (getting paid, so why should they?)

    <div class="md"><p>The most idiotic part of all of this narrative to those who&#39;ve been here long enough, is Trump has always been a conspiracy theorist!   Of course there is going to be overlap between the stories/articles that get posted here and those that would be posted there.  Trump&#39;s entire campaign was largely centered around fighting the globalists, which was a pretty big deal here pre election cycle as well.</p>

<p>What is actually happening is a coordinated attack on this sub by the same groups who took over <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.  They want to control the dialogue in all subs, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> are the last two large subs on Reddit where they don&#39;t completely control the message in the comments section.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll ever control T_D, but it looks like they&#39;re getting really close to controlling this sub with the way the &quot;Anti Trump Hysteria&quot; fueled comments are now constantly reaching the top in most threads.  </p>

Trumps campaign was saying outrageous crap then slowly walking it back and blaming everyone for actually listening to him. He was a nationalist on talking points, but how anyone whose main products and business ventures are globalist ventures managed to trick anyone he was fighting the globalist is literally the funniest things that have come from this.  He is a billionaire who has pretty much given billionaires reign of everything now.

<p>When they get high on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, they get to the front page of reddit, or close to it, and get flooded by non-regular readers of this subreddit.</p>

<p>Obviously most of Reddit is liberal leaning, so they spout off typical liberal talking points.</p>

<p>I think a better gauge is something like this <a href="https://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/">Reddit Subreddit Similarity calculator</a>.

<p>The strange thing is, Reddit isn&#39;t left-leaning as much as a blend of progressives and libertarian. For example, the site overwhelmingly supported Paul and Sanders both. Based on the complete 180 I saw of subreddits like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> during the election, I&#39;m inclined to believe the main subs are now astroturfed and giving the illusion of rabid liberals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if shill mods of reddit, u/spez, etc... didn&#39;t censor differing political opinions in other subs, they wouldn&#39;t have had a need to come to this sub.  Also, with Google Facebook etc... blatantly censoring their news, it has pretty much officially turned pro Trump views into &quot;conspiracy.&quot;  So it&#39;s annoying that this sub is more political now, but it&#39;s all a given considering the current state of reddit.  At least some of these trump thumpers might get redpilled lurking here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to demand that everyone fall in line with one point of view and if they&#39;re not they&#39;re shills. The only problem is there is no agreement on what that one point of view is.</p>

<p>So you end up with people being accused of shilling for the Zionists, the Illuminati, the NWO, the Aliens, etc..</p>

<p>It&#39;s pathetic.</p>

<p>The point you should take from this sub is shady shit happens, and we don&#39;t know the full truth of it, and probably never will. There are cover-ups and disinformation regarding what is going on.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to be able to stop some giant nation state play or false flag, so have an idea about it, but don&#39;t worry so much. Instead work on the local level where you can actually have an impact stopping corruption. From there you might be able to open some eyes and create change.</p>

<p>Arguments like &quot;You think the Rothschild&#39;s run the world? Lol! They&#39;re just the front for X&quot; do nothing for anyone.</p>
