        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s utterly absurd; I mean - the Earth is obviously a globe. Think about it for a moment. How could it NOT be a sphere? Everyone who isn&#39;t insane absolutely KNOWS that it is a sphere, therefore it must be.</p>

<p>That was my state of mind last week. Two nights ago there was a thread on the front page that said something like: &quot;Flat Earthers are just shills to discredit us REAL critical thinkers&quot; </p>

<p>It caught my attention because it was perhaps the third post within a few weeks that was nearly identical: &quot;This CRAZY theory is a SHILL attempt to undermine US&quot; as if WE are some organized group.</p>

<p>I read the comments in the thread. They struck me as coordinated. </p>

<p>&quot;Didn&#39;t everyone already KNOW that the flat earthers were shills?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are the proof that the dumbing down of America has succeeded&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are such retards&quot;</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>So I thought intensely about it for hours and realized that I had absolutely no clue whether the Earth was flat or not. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been to outer space.
I&#39;ve never experienced the curvature of the Earth.
I don&#39;t feel like I am moving at a gazillion miles an hour around a hot ball of gas.</p>

<p>So, in my reality, I just have no fucking clue what shape the Earth is, and if you KNOW for sure one way or the other then I would love to hear how you know.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You cannot empirically conclude the earth is round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes you can.</p>

<p>Simple geometry and observation proves the earth is spherical.</p>

<p>Pick a spot where you can see all the way to the horizon without obstruction. Send someone out to that horizon where they begin to disappear and measure the distance between you. Do that in multiple directions around you so that you can map your entire field of view. You will find that at some finite distance the person starts to go over a horizon. You will also find the distance to that horizon is the same in every direction.</p>

<p>Now build a tower where you were standing, the taller the better, and repeat the experiment of sending someone out to the horizon and measuring the distance. Then build it higher still, and measure again.</p>

<p>What you will find is that in every direction you look, you will be able to see further when you&#39;re higher, then when you&#39;re lower. You will be able to see a larger area of land at the top of the tower than in the middle, and a larger area of land in the middle than at the bottom.</p>

<p>If the earth was a flat plane, you would not be able to see further simply by moving higher. So the earth must be some other shape. The only shape that can accommodate the observations you have made is a sphere. On a sphere no matter which direction you look, the horizon will always be the same distance away at a specific height. If you go higher, the horizon will be further away, but still the same distance in every direction.</p>

<p>Based on the numbers you have recorded, you can calculate the curvature of the earth. This will allow you to calculate the circumference of the earth, and also to make predictions of how far away the horizon will be at a given height.</p>

<p>So now you build a new tower to a specific height, make the calculation, and predict how far away the horizon will be. You will be able to do this anywhere on the sphere where you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.</p>

<p>If you send someone out the specified distance, you will find they are on the horizon. Send them a little further and they will begin to disappear.</p>

<p>You can repeat this experiment over and over again, with different height towers and at different locations and still be able to predict how far away the horizon is.</p>

<p>That is an empirical way to prove the earth is a sphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the Flat Earth theory the sun must be a focused beam like a flashlight. If it wasn&#39;t a beam it would be able to be seen at night since it can never actually be below the horizon since there is no horizon. </p>

<p>All it takes for you to confirm that the Earth is in fact a sphere is to watch a sunrise or sunset and see what happens. </p>

<p>As the sun moves above or below the threshold of vision what shape is it? It&#39;s still round, right? The only part you can&#39;t see is the part that went BELOW THE HORIZON. </p>

<p>Can a flashlight do the same thing? If you look at the beam from the side doesn&#39;t the reflector distort the shape? A flashlight seen at an angle will be crescent shaped. </p>

<p>What about the sky? Is it light or dark? If it was a beam wouldn&#39;t it be dark? Sometimes you can see clouds or airplanes brightly lit when the sun is below the horizon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flat earth argument says that the sun only lights up part of the surface at a time because its light is a focused beam, like a flashlight with a reflector. This allows one part of the surface to be lit, while the other is in darkness.</p>

<p>The problem with that theory is that we can see the full lit face of the sun at all times. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t turn away from us at sunset, but instead drops below the horizon.</p>

<p>If I held a flashlight so that it was lighting you up, then turned it so that it was lighting someone else up and leaving you in darkness, you&#39;d see the source of the light change shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, according to them the sun moves in a circle above the Earth and shines down like a flashlight. The beam is creating night and day.</p>

<p>You seemed to be curious. I figured I&#39;d give you something other than their bullshit to think about. </p>

<p>Someone linked a video in one of the other FE discussions. The sun spins around the North pole and spins at a different distance depending on the season. It&#39;s closer to the North during Northern hemisphere summer and closer to the south in winter. They basically took the seasonal latitude information for the sun from some source and plotted it into their animation.</p>

<p>It kinda looks like it makes sense but if you notice that the distance around the outside of their &quot;map&quot; puts Australia, South Africa, and South America at a huge distorted distance. </p>

<p>We usually try to believe something because we assume that they&#39;re not bullshiting since we ourselves wouldn&#39;t bullshit about such a thing. Unfortunately, not everyone lives by the same standards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There once was a time when that was how people really thought. They just didn&#39;t know any better. As time passed and our knowledge increased some people figured out that it was a sphere. I&#39;m guessing it was probably ship captains trying to navigate that first came to the conclusion. </p>

<p>Being on a boat it&#39;s pretty easy to notice that the Earth isn&#39;t flat. You can look through a binocular and see that a ship at a particular distance is mostly hidden from view. The top is revealed first and the rest comes into sight as you move closer. </p>

<p>Seems to me that there are plenty of discrepancies that are obvious when you think about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The arc of the Sun as it passes above us is probably about 1000 miles from sunrise to sunset. That&#39;s not allowing for whatever distance is necessary to be at a constant height along the entire path. </p>

<p>The Sun always appears to be the same size. You can use your thumb to cover it at arms length to see that this is true as long as you use an appropriate protective filter.</p>

<p>Perspective is something that we are very familiar with. An object in the distance appears to be smaller than it would be if you are very close to it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible for something to move such a distance and not show a difference in size unless it&#39;s very very far away. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty good debunk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but that video accidentally proves the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yoA0zKX.png">In this frame, the maker of the video uses the mast as a sort of ruler.</a></p>

<p>We can see that the visible size of the ship is at least three masts high.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/03OOmmZ.png">Later in the video we find this frame.</a></p>

<p>I have drawn in similar lines to once again use the mast as a ruler to measure how much of the ship is visible. But what is this? Now the visible portion of the ship is much less than three masts high!</p>

<p>How can this be possible? That mast isn&#39;t growing, so its visible size should stay the same relative to the rest of the visible ship... but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>In fact, our rule says that a significant proportion of the ship is now hidden by the waves.</p>

<p>Is the ship sinking? Sort of... it is &quot;sinking&quot; below the horizon as it travels over the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>As and argument for flat earth, this video does a great job of proving a spherical earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.</p>

<p>None of those videos shows what you claim it does. Not one of them zooms in to a ship on the horizon so it can be clearly seen, then waits for it to disappear, then zooms in again to show it reappear.</p>

<p>What they all do is zoom in to a ship near/on the horizon, then zoom out and claim it disappeared.</p>

<p>What they are doing is relying on the resolution of the camera to make it <em>seem</em> like the ship has disappeared, when it never did.</p>

<p>The images that make up are video are in turn made up of pixels. Each pixel can only show one colour. When the camera is zoomed in, the ship covers many pixels, so many colours can be used to represent its shape and detail.</p>

<p>When the camera zooms out, the ship covers very few pixels, so only a few colours can be used to represent it. These colours are an average of the colours seen in that area of the field of view so if most of it is blue, the whole pixel becomes blue. That is how these videos are making the ship disappear.</p>

<p>What you will not find is a video of a clearly visible ship going over the horizon then the camera zooms in again to show that the ship comes back into view.</p>

<p>That is because the view of the ship is being blocked by the curvature rather than being hidden by poor resolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it&#39;s an annoying argument. If we can&#39;t prove that the Earth is a sphere in a clear way that makes sense and is indispensable then how can we ever hope to explain anything? </p>

<p>Which is probably exactly the point...</p>

<p>The believers in the Flat Earth could be purposely fucking with us. They may be trolls just doing it for amusement. They could be Government shills here to muddy the water and make conspiracy theories look ridiculous. Course there could be those who actually buy into the bullshit. </p>

<p>Actually, those who buy into the bullshit are the ones that worry me the most. They would have to believe in a let&#39;s say Global for lack of a better term. A Global conspiracy that apparently involves lots and lots of people. Everyone in aviation, spaceflight, and shipping would have to be in on it. Plus, several scientific disciplines would have to be in on it as well such as astronomy, seismology, and meteorology. How screwed up are you if you think that most of the planet is lying to you? </p>

<p>I tried to get the ball rolling to create a new section in the sidebar for conspiracy theories that have been busted. There is a place for ones that they claim to be proven. Seems to me that there should be a place for what&#39;s been disproven as well. I got very little support and drew criticism about censorship. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s hard to argue against FE because it&#39;s hard to see for oneself. 8&quot; of curvature over a mile is pretty difficult to detect. </p>

I&#39;m not much of a physics nerd but for the Earth as well as other planets (which in my observations never seem to be mentioned, just the Earth) to be flat just seems a tad preposterous to me. Also, for those saying that it&#39;s all a ruse for the government, how so? I&#39;m a paranoid bastard about some things but I can&#39;t find any logical or reasonable reason why exactly the government would try to take something such as a flat Earth and repress it so much. Maybe so scientists can get some grants but those aren&#39;t even worth much money and the scientists involved practically get pocket change unless if you&#39;re someone like Neil DeGrasse Tyson. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you think the flat earth theory is not based on a hell of a lot of assumptions?</p>

<p>Here is an example. They claim the sun is three thousand miles away floating above the surface of a flat earth following a circular path around the &quot;equator&quot;.</p>

<p>What keeps the sun up? What accelerates it through these circles?</p>

<p>The accepted theory is that the Earth is being accelerated around the sun by the sun&#39;s gravity. It is travelling too fast to fall onto the sun, but too slow to escape the sun and fly off into space. The combination of the earth&#39;s velocity and the sun&#39;s gravity keeps the earth in orbit around the sun. Likewise, the moon is kept in orbit around the earth by the combination of the moon&#39;s velocity and the earth&#39;s gravity.</p>

<p>What is the &quot;flat earth&quot; explanation? As far as I have seen, they have none. They simply assume it does what they need it to do for their model to <em>appear</em> to work. They can&#39;t actually explain <em>how</em> it does it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why their model fails.</p>

<p>The &quot;flat earth&quot; implies there is no universe, and all of it is just fakery to make us think there is. The real hoax is being perpetrated by god, apparently.</p>

<p>Just like the other intelligent design arguments, god is trying to trick us into thinking we&#39;re on an ancient planet in a vast universe by planting fake dinosaur fossils and creating fake stars.</p>

<p>Seriously, if that is true, god is an asshole.</p>

<p>So satan made the earth, the &quot;firmament&quot; and the stars? Because it is observations of those things that tell us we live on a spherical planet surrounded by a vast universe.</p>

<p>Someone made this place look like something it&#39;s not, and the bible claims god made it, so if we believe the bible then god is the one trying to trick us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let me start by saying the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory is a pseudo-scientific creation myth invented by a Catholic priest. As a theory, it is so full of holes that it <em>admits</em> it can&#39;t explain the vast majority of the universe.</p>

<p>I believe the universe is infinite in all four dimensions. It never had a beginning, a moment of creation, and thus there is no creator. Nothing made the universe, it just is.</p>

<p>What the physicists call the &quot;big bang&quot; is just an artifact of the limit of our ability to see this infinite universe, derived from a misunderstanding of how light works.</p>

<p>Even Edwin Hubble said that his observations are better explained by a hitherto unknown property of light which causes it to lose energy over vast distances and times. In his mind, &quot;redshift&quot; did not mean movement, it meant light was losing energy.</p>

<p>But even if our tiny part of the universe did expand from a point, that doesn&#39;t mean it was the beginning of the universe. It just means it was the beginning of our tiny part of it.</p>

<p>In an infinite universe, every event - no matter how unlikely - will happen because there are an infinite number of places and an infinite amount of time for it to happen.</p>

<p>We just happen to be part of one of those extremely unlikely but ultimately inevitable random chances.</p>

<p>And what were the details of the lenses used?</p>

<p>If they had a very narrow field of view, they would need to be at a much greater height to show the curvature, if they had a wider field of view, they would likely introduce distortion into the image that could cause the horizon to look concave, flat or convex, depending on the angle the camera is facing.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to take any photo as proof of curvature or lack of curvature without knowing the precise details of the lens and the altitude the photo was taken at.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re misinformed. The horizon is always flat (or rather: level), yes, on a spherical planet: You&#39;re looking from a vantage point and onto a circle going around you. That&#39;s level.</p>

<p>When I am at sea level, I can only see a few miles in any direction. When I climb to the top of a large hill I can see further. When I go up in an airliner I can see for hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>My eyes don&#39;t change based on altitude. My eyesight doesn&#39;t get better.</p>

<p>The only possible explanation for this is the fact I&#39;m standing on a very large sphere where the surface is curving down away from me in every direction. The only shape which fits that description is a sphere.</p>

<p>On a flat earth where the limit of my vision is determined by perspective, I would not be able to see further simply by moving to the top of a hill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Pgtj5tB.png">Here is why</a></p>

<p>At the top is a flat earth. On a flat earth I should be able to see as far as there is land to see, because it is always in view.</p>

<p>At the bottom is a spherical earth, however, I can only see as much land as the distance to the horizon, because the rest of it is hidden behind the curvature.</p>

<p>On flat earth, when I go higher, I don&#39;t see more land, because I could already see it all.</p>

<p>On spherical earth, when I go higher, less land is hidden behind the curve so I can see more of it.</p>

<p>The flat earthers try to explain this by saying that my eyesight is limited by the vanishing point, but that wouldn&#39;t change when I climb to the top of a hill, so I should still see the same distance.</p>

<p>We know this is not the case, and people can see a lot further simply by going higher, which proves our vision is not limited by the vanishing point, but instead is limited by the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>OK, so you admit the horizon will drop. You can&#39;t back out now. If I show a video that proves the horizon drops, then you have to admit the earth is not flat... right?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFj7gNh3yOM">Here is the proof</a></p>

<p>And just in case you refuse to watch the video, here are some screenshots that prove the horizon drops the higher you go.</p>

<p>Uhh...</p>

<p>The sphericity of the Earth was established by Greek astronomy in the 3rd century BC, and the earliest terrestrial globe appeared from that period.  The earliest known example is the one constructed by Crates of Mallus in Cilicia (now Çukurova in modern-day Turkey), in the mid-2nd century BC.</p>

<p>An acre is one chain by 10 chains.  </p>

<p>When this data was compiled and compared errors occurred.  Euclidian geometry did not work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That land surveyor post was really weird. It seemed like someone got him to post it, but then he made a fool of himself by not backing anything up, saying 3 miles was the utmost longest distance he ever worked with, and didn&#39;t refute a single flat earth argument. I wonder who puts these people up to that kind of thing. Who pays anti-flat earth shills?</p>
