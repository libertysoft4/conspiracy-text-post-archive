    <div class="md"><p>I am relying on my education to form opinions not what the elites say necessarily, Trumps actions, for the most part, when it comes to Wall Street are consistent with his words. I&#39;ll agree some aren&#39;t. I agree on Glass Steagall, it is a vital piece of legislation that should remain, they talk of replacing it with an updated version as it was signed in the 1930s I believe, but I will wait to form my judgements on this new bill until I know what is in it. As for Dodd-Frank, the entire thing was not rolled back, as I&#39;m sure you know. it is compromised of hundreds of different regulations, the ones repealed make it easier for smaller businesses to obtain loans necessary for their day to day operations; the regulations dealing with the relaxed lending standards that had a hand in causing the financial crisis of 2009 are still in place. Many, even the CEOs of Wall Street banks agree that these regulations are absolutely necessary to prevent another crises from happening. It really isn&#39;t as bad as you seem to think.</p>

<p>Yes, but that doesn&#39;t mean that Dodd Frank is a good law, or that Trump might not still pass Glass Steagall. It&#39;s very important to create pressure for this right now.</p>

<p>Stop. You&#39;re not thinking clearly. This is black and white thinking, the world can run in grays.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that Trump is in bed with the banks, but he can still push Glass-Steagall through. Stranger things have happened. The original Glass-Steagall was put in by a 33rd degree freemason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump signed an EO rolling back Dodd-Frank.</p>

<p>Dodd Frank is a terrible law. It&#39;s incredibly favorable to big banks; it created massive new regulatory costs that put all the small banks out of business.</p>
