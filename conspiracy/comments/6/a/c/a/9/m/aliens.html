        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve always been interested in aliens, but only in the same way I&#39;m interested in supernatural phenomenon - as an experience more reflective of the idiosyncrasies and complexities of human perception. Very recently though, I watched a video on my favorite YouTube channel (strange mysteries people, where you at?) and they talked about microorganism surviving the harshness of space. And how this is legitimate. So my question here is... Isn&#39;t this, at least, an incredibly suggestive piece of evidence, and at most, outright proof that life exists outside of earth? I mean, it&#39;s not reptilian shapeshifters or little green/grey dudes, but if these microorganisms exist, then... What the fuck else exists along with it?</p>

<p>Also. Why doesn&#39;t this come up more? I&#39;ve heard lots about different kinds of aliens, Ufo sightings, whatever. All of those arguments are dubious, though. This &quot;space life&quot; based argument seems totally sound to me, though, so I wonder why people don&#39;t bring this up more? Maybe they do and my head is stuck in the sand.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;d appreciate anyone who knows more about this topic than me dropping some knowledge, or pointing me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life exists on dimensions higher than this 3rd density. Most life in the universe is more evolved than us and does not require what we require to survive. Even the vacuum of space is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Beings of 5D and above can take material form at will, but exist in what we would perceive as nonphysical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im interested in how you talked about dimensions. I always thought most people&#39;s idea of a dimension was based on sci-fi. But this seems more like an issue of perceptions and planes and forms of existence, rather than some wormhole, time travel stuff. So what does it even mean to lie in a plane beyond perception? And moreover, how can we ever truly pick up on anything that far ahead of us? I feel like these are rookie questions I should be asking Google, but if any of you guys has anything to add, that&#39;d be great, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. People get mixed up when bringing time into the mix too, but time is not real, only our perception of it is.</p>

<p>We are all existing on multiple planes simultaneously. We have layers of energetic body and are experiencing overlays of different densities at all times. The imperceivable spirit world affects the physical world and vise-versa. We have &#39;higher selves&#39; which is the knowing or intuition that we are tapping into, as well as spirit guides who are usually part of our original soul group.</p>

<p>Like the analogy of &#39;flat-land&#39; a 2d being cannot perceive a 3d being entering their plane of existence without an expanded awareness of what their plane actually is in relation to others. </p>

<p>Everything is vibration. Consciousness evolves in densities from simple life to more complex life, and takes different physical forms in its evolution. Consciousness can also emerge from Source into lower densities, but through experiences we are always moving in the same direction back to Source.</p>

<p>Right now all of Earth is going to a transition from 3rd density to 5th density. This means that in the near future there will be no more polarity within the collective consciousness. This also means face to face contact with the positive ETs (soul groups/soul families) who have been helping us get rid of the negative groups manipulating us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound a lot like my dmt trip. No sarcasm, for real. Just the idea that our consciousness is bleeding into multiple planes of existence while we&#39;re mostly unaware is something that fucks with me. My feeling is that psychedelic experiences are often the noticing of this &quot;consciousness bleeding.&quot; </p>

<p>The polarity of the collective consciousness is also interesting - I tend to think of humanity is being connected through our neural processes, even if we&#39;re not aware of it wholly. There has to be some kind of imperceptible frequencies that the brain can unconsciously notice. I just feel like, if there was a way to induce a psychedelic state in everyone (not necessarily the trip; just the spiritual lessons involved) then maybe the actual connection of that consciousness would appear. We&#39;d literally all be on the same level - wouldn&#39;t this allow us to ascend to a sort of hive-mind that&#39;s splinted through a multitude of individuals? I don&#39;t know. What I am sure of, though, if that humanity has far from understood our own functions in relation to the rest of the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes totally, dmt can temporarily open our awareness to these other layers of reality. Symbolism, numerology, synchronicity, sacred geometry, fractals.. are all ways that these other aspects of reality can be observed in everyday &#39;reality&#39;.</p>

<p>This &#39;state&#39; you speak of is happening naturally to the both the planet and us right now... this is happening with the rise of the Schumann resonance. This is proof that we are all rising in frequency - expanding our conscious awareness. </p>

<p>Yes, we are absolutely to transcend our limitations and see ourselves connected to God-Source-Universe. We are all a part of that. It&#39;s the deception that we are separate from &#39;God&#39; is what the Cabal/Illuminati have been pulling on us for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, actually, and have often explained to people how life&#39;s origins don&#39;t need to have any meaning outside of having assuaged the necessary scientific and mathematical processes. Basically, what needed to happen for us to be here happened; it doesn&#39;t have any inherent meaning outside of those results. This does imply that extraterrestrial life exists, as well. Even something like the Drake equation... Which thankfully has nothing to do with overly emotional sing-rapping, is highly suggestive that these processes happen all around the universe regardless of our perceptions or knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry it rubbed you the wrong way. I could point you to what I believe is credible evidence of UFOs but you might not reach the same conclusions and then we&#39;ll be arguing over it like retards. Not very productive.</p>

<p>The best way to reach a conclusion is to research yourself, not be spoonfed the answers. That is unless you ask specific questions, but what you&#39;re asking here is very broad. The article you&#39;re mentioning is in my opinion, just a soft-disclosure, an idea seed they can use as a story later on when the cabal needs to district.</p>

<p>See not everyone is at the same point in their research and their perspectives will be different and going into details requires much more time on the person responding.</p>

<p>But that being, do you seriously believe, in the vast expanding still universe, that we are the <em>most</em> and <em>only</em> intelligent living being in the universe? It sounds pretentious ain&#39;t it? That&#39;s just how we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not interested in debating ufos, though, and find it odd that you&#39;re mentioning that. I&#39;m interested in how microbes in space effect our understanding of life in the universe. Just like how I was never trying to imply that life doesn&#39;t exist, or that were alone. That&#39;s why I lashed out at you, because you&#39;re addressing stuff I wasn&#39;t even trying to talk about while also seemingly putting words in my mouth. Of course I think life exists other than us. It basically has to. I&#39;m not sure why you think I&#39;m implying the opposite. I&#39;m not interested in any arguments about the probability of life existing outside of earth, since really, it clearly does. Maybe this isn&#39;t proof of prototypical green men, but it&#39;s a fantastic starting point down that path, is it not? Look, if these microorganisms exist in space, then all other life is directly implied. That&#39;s why I even started this thread.</p>

<p>And I wanted to address your comments on spoonfeeding. I also had a feeling someone would say that. As someone who ardently researches any interesting topic, I feel it&#39;s in my best interest to keep all avenues open. If anyone here sees something I don&#39;t, knows more about where to look, whatever, why wouldn&#39;t I wanna be open to that? It only supplements my reading. Asking questions about something I&#39;m interested in isn&#39;t spoon feeding - asking you do to the research would. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m only trying to make my life easier, since it&#39;s likely someone on here can save me time by saying something or telling me to look somewhere specific.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, I try to be open-minded and ask you fuckers about what could be an area of expertise, and I&#39;m told I want shit spoon-fed. It&#39;s legitimately funny to me, since the people I know in real life know how weird I am about independence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is not. Aliens refers to extraterrestrial life. Ufo means unidentified flying object. That&#39;s quite an obvious distinction. But hey, if you think extraterrestrial life and flying saucers are the same thing, then great. Just don&#39;t bother me with any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s so very fucking true. People are all about separating themselves from the natural functions that were apart of - it&#39;s like we still have this geocentric view of ourselves despite how easily we can all be informed nowadays.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny that this statement is very obviously true yet revelatory for a lot of people. I remember when, as an adult, that dawned on me for the first time. Why would the default be the opposite -- that the universe is outside of us, something that threatens us at times, needs to be figured out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to the concept of &#39;natural&#39;. How can anything be natural when nothing could ever be unnatural? There&#39;s no such thing as a man made substance. We never pull something out of thin air. </p>
